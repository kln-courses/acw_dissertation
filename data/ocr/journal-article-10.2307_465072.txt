Their work also casts light on what we may call the mythical poetics of archaic Greece. Their books and essays on memory, on the poet as a "master of truth," on the shifting roles of "guile" [metis] in relation to cosmogony, poetry, technology, power, and intelligence have brilliantly illuminated the underlying assumptions and practices of Homer, Hesiod, Alcman, Simonides, and many others. As Vernant has shown in "Aspects mythiques de la memoire et du temps," the poet's power of commemoration enables him to cross the bound- aries between the living and the dead, between the past and the present [Mythe et pensee chez les Grecs 87]. In a much cited section of Les maitres de verite dans la Grace archarque [22ff.], Detienne demonstrates that "truth" [aletheia] of archaic Greek poetry does not correspond to "veracity" in the modern sense of "truthfulness," but rather forms part of a system of oppositions important to the values of an oral culture: preservation versus oblivion, light versus darkness, praise versus blame. What is "truthful" for the archaic poet is not so much what is factually exact as what successfully resists the corrosive darkness of forgetting. Pindar's poetry stands at a point of transition between an oral and a written culture. This is also the transition between the traditional, past-oriented archaic society, much of whose intellectual energy is expended in maintaining through memory the communal records and the accumulated lore of the past, and the growing critical spirit of the Sophistic movement, whose major efforts are directed toward challenging the past and rethinking traditional wisdom. At such a crisis a traditional poet like Pindar is particularly concerned to probe the meaning of "Truth" and to deepen its archaic significance as A - letheia, the force of the poetic voice that vanquishes the forgetting of heroic deeds.' 1 For these issues see my essays, "Tragedie, Oralit6, Ecriture," especially 140-42, and Pin- dar's Mythmaking: The Fourth Pythian Ode, especially chapter 8. diacritics / summer 1986 65</page><page sequence="2">In his recent L'invention de la mythologie Detienne points out how Pindar too, despite his conservatism, is aware of the deceptiveness of poetic narration or mythos, "le mauvais recit traditionnel" [97-99]. Over against the potential falsehood of daedalic mythos [Olym- pian 1: 28 ff.], however, Pindar sets the corrected, purified accounts of his own poetry. For all of these criticisms of mythos, however, Pindar's "truth" remains a fundamentally mythical construct. It is closely associated with the permanence of the immortal gods. In order to achieve this truth and to bring it into the mortal world, the poet, like his hero, journeys figuratively into the unknown, crosses the formless tracts of a primordial chaos, and emerges into the realm of creative energies and permanence. In Pindar's most important surviving work, the four books of the Epinician Odes, the poet's relation to truth is particularly problematical. These poems, written to commemorate specific athletic victories from all over the Greek world, are occasional poems, each com- posed to celebrate a single specific event. In adapting his art to victors from different cities and different traditions, (although all of them, presumably, share aristocratic class values), Pindar confronts the problem of what is constant in his art. Realizing that he practices a "craft" [techne] or skill [sophia] that can serve different men in diverse cities and cir- cumstances, he is concerned to separate himself from the "mercenary Muse" who obeys only "profit" [kerdos, Isthmian 2: 6 ff.]. Instead of unstable, amorally adaptable "profit," and its attendant associations of trick- ery, expediency, non-aristocratic shiftiness, and unheroic changeability, Pindar's art (as he asserts) serves a single, permanent goal.2 This is the Truth that he derives from Zeus and the gods. His Muse stands close to Truth, daughter of Zeus, and both together ward off falsehood [Olympian 10: 3-6]. In this ode, too, Truth is closely associated with the creative energies of first beginnings, with the emergence of the unformed into the orderly procession of Olympian creation, and with the moments when the unnamed receives the stabilizing identity of nomenclature. Pindar's mythicizing (some would say mystifying or ideologizing) of Truth depends heavily on its role in cosmogonic narrations and in foundation legends at- tended by birth. This mythical dimension of Truth, in its associations with poetry,time, crea- tion, naming, and the establishment of order- cosmological, political, and aesthetic - is the primary subject of this study. 2 Pindar is probably more explicit than any ancient Greek poet about the aims, nature, and dignity of his art. He strives to create a poetry of truth and praise, in contrast to the poetry of deception and blame that he associates with Homer's Odyssey and with Ar- chilochus.3 His is a poetry of inherited gifts and god-given inspiration rather than rationally acquired technique. But beside these explicit statements, which specialists have often col- lected and analyzed,4 there is also an implicit poetics. This appears not only in direct statements about poetry but also in the myths and in the form of symbolic utterance which these myths contain. Of particular importance are the myths of origin. Pindar returns repeatedly to the begin- ning of things, the arche: the creation of cities and cults, the founding of colonies and of the games, the invention of songs, temple architecture, the horse's bit, the love-charm of the iynx, the first shedding of kindred blood, and so on.5 For Pindar, as for other poets of all times and places, the sources of poetic creation are mysterious, hidden, approachable only 2The conflicts between "profit" and heroism surface again, some half-century later, in Neoptolemus' choice between the values of Odysseus and the values of Philoctetes (and Achilles) in Sophocles' Philoctetes of 409 B.C. (e.g. lines 77-120). 3See, for example, Pyth. 2: 52-56 and Nem. 7: 20-27. Cf. also Nem. 8: 32-44. For a good discussion see Gentili 13-23; also Bernardini 21ff. See my Pindar's Mythmaking, chapter 1. 4See. for instance, Bowra, Pindar, chapter 1; Gianotti, Per una poetica pindarica; Maehler, Die Auf- fassung des Dichterberufs im friohen Griechentum bis zur Zeit Pindars. 5Cf. 01. 3: 1ff; 01. 7: 35ff; 01. 10: 24ff and 49ff; 01. 13: 17ff. and 65ff; Pyth. 2: 3 1ff; Pyth. 12: 18ff; frag. 46 Bowra = 52i Snell; frag. 61 Bowra = 70b Snell. Pindar's predilection for myths of origin is briefly noted by Bernardini 140, note 55. 66</page><page sequence="3">with effort or through a difficult journey, like the mythical road through the heavens trav- ersed by Parmenides at the beginning of his philosophical poem "On Nature." Such sources are closely related to the processes that create the permanent features of our world, and they appear through analogies with those creative processes. Thus Pindar can grasp the elusive origins of poetry by establishing a network of coherences between cosmogonic creation, the foundations of political and social order, and the procreation of strong and handsome children. Myths of creation imply poetic creation. Pindar, as we shall see, privileges the generative act of the father as the active, formative agent of creation.6 In a hymn of which only a bare summary survives in much later quotation, the creation of poetry is closely associated with the creative act that lies behind the wedding of Zeus and Hera on Olympus [Bowra, Pindar 12]. On this festal occasion, Zeus asks the gods if they have any requests, and they ask that "he make for himself gods who shall adorn with words and music" the great things that he has done to order the universe. The wedding feast, therefore, celebrates Zeus's role in bringing the world to its present state. It is also the occasion of a second, mimetic creative act, one whose aim is to celebrate in song the creative energies of Zeus. Closer to the human world, but also parallel to cosmogonic creation, are the moments when new life emerges from the realm of the unnamed (and hence the non-existent, the ver- bally unformed) into the specificity of being by receiving a human name. The close iden- tification between the name of a person or thing and its essential nature is deeply rooted in archaic Greek thought. One need think only of Aeschylus' lines on the name of Helen or Plato's Cratylus. 7 The act of creation may itself be identified with the act of naming. In his ac- count of Arion's invention of the dithyramb, for example, Herodotus juxtaposes "making," "naming" and "teaching" (presenting) as simultaneous and virtually equivalent actions: "Arion is the first of men whom we know who made and named and taught the dithyramb in Corinth" [1: 23, author's emphasis]. In Olympian 10 the central myth is a creative act, the founding of the Olympian games. The Moirai, goddesses who oversee the portion prescribed to each individual at birth, attend the moment when the hill of Kronos passes from being "nameless" to receiving its name. Here, as also in the story of the birth of lamus in Olympian 6 (to which we shall return in more detail later), the delimiting power of the word, as embodied in the power to name, is intimately associated with the sacred moment that divides being from non-being. That mo- ment attends the creation of a historical place (the holy sanctuary of Olympia) or the creation of a human life (the holy prophet whose task it will be to continue to mediate between gods and men). 3 These connections have one of their richest mythical developments in Pindar's Fourth Pythian Ode, the longest extant choral poem of archaic Greece. Its subject is two-fold: Jason's winning of the Golden Fleece and the founding of Cyrene. Euphemus, a member of Jason's crew on the Argonautic expedition, is the mythical ancestor of Battus, colonizer of Cyrene and remote ancestor of King Arcesilaus IV, the ruler for whose Pythian victory in the chariot races of 462 B.C. Pindar wrote the ode. Although his work has rather little to say about poetry explicitly, it is rich in Pindar's implicit poetics. The ode begins with the poet in the present moment, sameron, the "today" of the festival. He stands beside Arcesilaus as the King celebrates his victory. The ode concludes with a glimpse of remote origins and eternal things. Pindar urges King Arcesilaus to restore an exiled nobleman, Damophilus, to his place in Cyrene. The mythical paradigm for this action is Zeus's release of the defeated Titans from their imprisonment in Tartarus [291]. This event completes the founding of the Olympian 6Cf.

On the male parent as the active and formative agent in early Greek thought see Zeitlin 149-84, especially 169ff. 7See Fraenkel 68 1ff. and 687. So too in Plato's Phaedrus, at the end of Socrates' first speech (238 a-c), the name of the appetite in question is bound up with its essential quality. For Pindar see Quincy, 142-48. diacritics / summer 1986 67</page><page sequence="4">world-order and affirms the supremacy of Zeus's reign (cf. Hesiod, Theogony 617ff.). The ex- ile, returning from Greece to Libya, is then to tell "what wondrous spring of ambrosial verses he found as a guest in Thebes." Thus from the present day, attended by the Muse, of Arcesilaus' celebration in far-away Cyrene in line 1 we have come to a mythical foundation of immortal song in the poet's native city in the closing line. Poetry is the mediating force be- tween the single, concrete moment of mortal life and the realm of being, the creative energies of the world that belong to the eternal vitality of the gods. The link between the story of Jason and the foundation legend of Cyrene is a mysterious clod of earth offered by the sea-god Triton (in disguise) to the Argonaut Euphemus. This magical piece of earth is metaphorically the "immortal seed" from which the mainland of Cyrene is to grow or bloom. If Euphemus had kept the clod secure, his descendants would have founded Cyrene in the fourth generation. As it is, since the clod is washed overboard, the founding act will have to wait for the seventeenth generation, the generation of Battus. The story of the clod has behind it a narrative pattern briefly analyzed by Marcel De- tienne. A questing hero overcomes the pathless waste of pontos -the sea as the untraversed deep- in order to bring back to mortals a gift of the gods, a magical object or a prized knowledge.8 The most influential form of this myth is Menelaus' contest with the metamor- phic sea-god Proteus in the Odyssey. By enduring Proteus' terrifying changes of shape, the hero wrests from him the secret that makes possible his homeward journey across that god's shifting and dangerous element. Pindar's hero confronts a similar metamorphic sea-divinity, the god Triton (not actually named) "in the eddies of the Tritonian marsh." The god takes on the likeness of mortal form (cf. eidomeno, 21; prosopsin, 29). For ten days previously, Pindar relates, the men of the Argo carried their ship over the "back of the sea" [26-27]. The whole passage stresses the interchange between land and sea.9 The meeting that is fateful for the marine creation of Cyrene, then, takes place in a realm of changing shapes and shifting elements: between earth and sea, divine and human, life and death (cf. the reference to the entrance to Hades in 43f.), safe return and endless voyage, the firm foundation of a mainland and the undemarcated, limitless sea. In his opening lines the poet calls on his Muse to "increase the breeze of songs" [3]. At the end he is to "travel on a wagon-track," amaxiton - that is, on land - as he nears the end of his long table: makra moi neisthai kat'amaxiton ["It is a far journey for me to traverse on the wagon-road," 247]. The emergence of the clod from the watery waste between land and sea in the Argo's remote sailings corresponds to the poet's achievement of the formed creation of his ode, whereby he brings the exile back across the seas, from Greek mainland to African coast, so that he may "see his home" after "bilging out the destructive disease" of exile and may enjoy the social pleasure of symposiac festivity at the local "spring of Apollo" [293-95]. In this reference to a Cyrenaean landmark the chaotic waters of the marshy waste have become the life-giving waters of the Olympian god of music and art. Here, then, the exile will find himself among the cultured men of a civilized community, the sophoi [295], as he "lifts his elaborately crafted lyre" [daidalea phorminx] and looks back to another city, the place of his hospitable reception [xenia] Thebes, where he "found a fountain of ambrosial songs" [pagan ambrosi6n epe6n, 299]. With these words Pindar ends this long ode. The "ambrosial" fountain not only mythicizes the Cyrenaean "spring of Apollo." It also stands in extreme contrast with Triton's marsh at the beginning of the Argonaut myth [20f.]. It marks the successful completion of return [nostos] in contrast with line 32, where the "excuse of a sweet return" [nostos] allegedly kept the disguised sea-daimon from remaining with the Argonauts [on the motif of nostos, see Crotty, 106ff.]. These words also set the poet's ac- complishment of his ode into the framework of completed journey, sweet and life-giving 8The mythical pattern is discussed by Detienne in Maitres de la v6rite 34ff, with a brief reference to Pyth. 4 in note 41, page 36. 9Thus the ship, carried on land, is "wood made sea" (27), while the clod of earth, washed from the ship, becomes a thing of the sea ("washed from the ship as belonging to the sea it went off with the brine" 38f). Had Euphemus kept it and deposited it "by the chthonic mouth of Hades, going to holy Taenarus" (43-49), his descendants would have taken Libya's "broad mainland" (48) in the fourth rather than in the seventeenth generation. On the interchanges of sea and land see in general Farenga, "Pindaric Craft and the Writing of Pythia" 24-28: also my Pindar's Mythmaking, chapter 4. On such shifts in relation to myths of craft, arts, and metis generally see Vernant and Detienne 245ff. 68</page><page sequence="5">water, an immortal gift that overcomes death ("ambrosial"), and the celebration of civilized institutions. Thus beside the explicitly stated, practical function, to recommend the return of an exile, the closing verses also form part of the implicit poetics of the ode through the motif of a journey across vast tracts of ocean to obtain a radiant object (the poet's personal equivalent to Jason's Golden Fleece) and to touch the fountain of ambrosial substance at Thebes. The emergence of immortal artistry from the formless depths that is implicit in Pythian 4 is more explicit in Nemean 7, where the poet's Muse "joins together gold and white ivory and the lily flower, taking it from the dew of the sea" [Nemean 7: 77-79]. This metaphorical act of poetic creation brings together the permanence of gold and the delicate fragility of the flower [leirion anthemon 79], the latter perhaps also alluded to in the reference to "weaving crowns" or garlands in the verse immediately preceding. The finished product, however, whether jewel or diadem, does not result only from the handiwork of "joining" metal and ivory. It also involves a plunge into the primordial element of pontos in order "to take out from below" [huphelein] its mysterious flower.10 The collocation pontia eersa, "sea dew," transforms pontos, the uncharted tracts of the barren sea, into the repository of a fertilizing, creative power, the "dew" that throughout Pindar attends the energy of poetic creation."1 These lines also concern the coming together of diverse, contrasting substances. That physical act of craftsmanly joining corresponds to the verbal craftsmanship of the poet, the callida iunctura of "sea" and "dew" in the phrasing of line 79. The salty wastes of the sea are, of course, the very antithesis of the fresh, sweet dew. This point of creative origins is a parallel, in microcosm, to the point of intersecting opposites where the clod-seed of Cyrene emerged from the remote marshes of the elusive Triton. The passage of Nemean 7 unites animate and inanimate substances, gold and plant, sea-water and dew, concentrated civilized craftsmanship and primordial elements. 4 The Olympian games in Olympian 10 are a specifically human creation of the founding- hero, Heracles, but are nevertheless drawn into the processes of cosmogonic creation discussed above. The hill of Kronos (the Kronion) emerges from its covering of snow as if from the primordial waters of life: kai pagon Kronou prosphthegxato; prosthe gar nonumos, has Oinomaos arche, brecheto polla niphadi. [And [Heracles] shouted forth [as name] the hill of Kronos; for previously, as nameless, while Oenomaus ruled it, it was drenched with abundant snowfall. 49-51] Directly upon the act of naming follows the "first-birth rite," accompanied by the Moirai, who attend human birth, and by the agency of Time: tauta d'en protogono teleta parestan men ara Moirai schedon ho t'exelegchon monos alatheian etetumon Chronos. 10The "flower" has long been thought to be coral, which, however, the Greeks seem not have known. It may therefore refer to the shellfish (murex) that provides the highly prized purple dye. For discussion see Boedecker 94. 11On pontos generally see Vernant and Detienne, Les ruses de I'intelligence 149-51 and 212-15. For "dew" in Pindar see Boedecker 92ff. diacritics / summer 1986 69</page><page sequence="6">[In this first-birth ritual the Moirai stand near and also Time, who alone tests what is really truth. 52-55] The fabulous snowstorm that "drenches" the site at its protogonos teleuta, the rite that at- tends the miraculous "firstness" of birth, corresponds to a miraculous, quasi-fluid and fertiliz- ing bathing, a symbolic equivalent to the process of emergent life. The sequence of motifs in the passage is important: Olympia passes from anonymity to having a name; the snow envelopes the place; there is the sanctified rite of birth; and Time is present as the test of truth. The verbal act of conferring a name becomes part of the process of creation itself and also part of the monumentalizing effect of Truth as the negation of obliv- ion in time.12 Through the poetic logos time cooperates with truth to preserve human deeds from oblivion, as an operation symmetrical with the processes of birth and creation. Elsewhere Pindar proclaims the commemorative power of the "fame" [kleos] conferred by the poet as something enduring "for myriad time": kai gar heroon polemistai logon ekerdanan; kleontai d'en te phormiggessin en aulon te pamphonois homoklais murion chronon. [For among heroes the goodly warriors gained the profit of fame; and they are made famous in the lyres and in the full-voiced calls of flutes for myriad time. Isthmian 5: 26-28] The phrase "myriad time" receives special emphasis by being carried over in enjambement as the opening words of the antistrophe. The obverse of this preservative effect of Time and Truth for noble deeds is the healing effect of "forgetfulness," lethe, for painful events. Pindar develops this thought in Olympian 2: 15-22: Of deeds done in justice and contrary to justice, not even Time, father of all things, could make the fulfillment undone (apoieton). But with a fortunate lot there might be forgetfulness (lethe). For through noble joys pain, recrudescent, is conquered and dies (thnaskei), whenever the god's portion sends lofty happiness from afar. Whereas the poetic words and the founder's creative energy save great deeds through the memory of birth and the "non-oblivion" of aletheia (as in Olympian 10: 49-55), the remedy for unhappy deeds is "forgetting" and "death" (lethe, thnaskein). Correspondingly, in a myth of birth that has an ending deemed morally unworthy of preservation in song, Pindar maintains silence and suppresses the act of naming. In Isthmian 120n this passage see Kromer 420-36, especially 425-26; also my Pindar's Mythmaking, chapter 5, part ii. g C'unr krater 5tamno3 70</page><page sequence="7">5 Pindar relates the story of Phocus, the son of the sea-goddess Psamathe, who is murdered by his half-brothers, Peleus and Telamon. After listing the three brothers, Pindar evokes the mysterious ancestry of Phocus in a grandiose line, full of Homeric echoes about birth and the sea: ho tas theou, hon Psamatheia tikt' epi rhegmini pontou [Phocus], child of the goddess, whom Psamatheia bore on the edge of pontos. [Nemean 5: 13] The margin between sea and land here serves a point of symbolical transition between non- existence and birth and also, in the suppressed tale of murder, between life and death.13 Thus the motif of birth here leads not to the enduring memory of the name or the cir- cumstances in which divine origins are commemorated in the act of naming (as in the story of Ajax in Isthmian 6, discussed below), but rather to inhibition about speaking and to the oc- casional desirability of silence [14-18].14 As the negation of the glory of commemorative song, silence also brings a re-immersion into a formless watery darkness. In Isthmian 5, whose lines on the kleos of heroic warriors we have cited above, Pindar praises the great naval victory over the Persians at Salamis, but then alludes obliquely to the medizing of Thebes [48-53]: And now the city of Ajax, Salamis, would bear witness in Ares that it has been raised up straight by its sailors in the much-destroying rain of Zeus, a slaughter thick as hail of men numberless. But yet drench down boasting in silence; Zeus apportions this and that, Zeus lord of all things. The phrase, "drench down boasting in silence," [kauchama katabreche siga], re-immerses great deeds in the chaos of nature's violence: the "rain" and "hail" of Zeus that kills men in numbers too great to name ["numberless," 50]. In more positive contexts, as we shall see later, the verb katabrechein, "drench down," denotes a liquid envelopment in the vital im- mortalizing radiance of celestial favor and procreative energy, particularly in myths of origins [cf. Olympian 6.55, 7.34, 10.50, discussed below]. Here, however, the verb points in the op- posite direction, to something that (like the murder of Phocus) is better left unheard. But im- mediately afterwards Pindar returns to the "honors" [timai] of athletic victory and the "lovely honey" of song [cf. Olympian 10.98f., where the poet will "drench down in honey the manly city" of the victory; see also Olympian 10.51]. A passage in another ode written (probably) with reference to bereavement in the Per- sian War shows a similar pattern of linking failure and silence with the destructive movements of nature. In Isthmian 4: 16-21 Pindar describes a Theban family's losses (possi- ble in the battle of Plataea, and in the Persian cause) with the vivid metaphor of a "harsh snowstorm of war" that "on a single day left the happy hearth bereft of four men" [tracheia niphas polemoio 17]. In contrast to Zeus's fertilizing golden snow that attends the birth of cities, athletic games, and heroes,15 this "harsh snowstorm" brings death and darkness to the unnamed individuals who died in battle. After the "harsh snowstorm of war" Pindar offers the hope for renewal in the return of spring, for "now, after the winter darkness of months, the dappled earth blossomed with crimson roses through the counsels of divinities": 1"Cf. Odyssey 4: 448ff., where Menelaus, becalmed on a death-like island near Egypt, lies in wait for Proteus "by the strand of the sea" the spot where his seals emerge from the sea and sleep. On this passage and the ambiguity of the seal between land and sea and its implications, with reference also to the phocus ("seal-man'9 of Pindar's myth, see Vernant and Detienne, Les ruses de V'intelligence 246. 14For the poet's silencing himself as a transitional or break-off formula, cf.

A slightly less heavily mythicized version of these operations appears in Nemean 6, where the athlete's victories "put an end to the oblivion" of a deceased kinsman, Socleides [epause lathan Saokleida, Nemean 6: 20-21]. The very fact of naming Socleides in the con- text of the present victor's glory serves to "stop forgetfulness." The poet's song thus parallels the victor's deeds in overcoming lethe. This equation becomes explicit a few lines later as Pindar uses one of his frequent athletic metaphors to describe himself as poet. He himself hopes to hit the mark with his arrows of song, while he invokes his Muse to direct "a fair- famed breeze of words" to the victorious athlete [ouron epeon euklea 28b-29]. Euklees, the word denoting the glory conferred by the poet's kleos, is emphatically placed in the verse. Its relevance to the life-preserving power of epic song becomes clear at once in the gnomic statement that follows: paroichomenon gar aneron aoidai kai logoi ta kala sphin erg' ekomisan. [For of men who are gone songs and words (of praise) tend their noble deeds. 29-30b] This principle is at once made relevant to the victor's family: his is a "race of ancient fame" [palaiphatos genea, 31] that has obtained numerous songs of praise [enkomia, 32]. Through its noble deeds [ergmata, 33; cf. erga, 30b] this family is a frequent subject of song for the "tillers of the Pierian Muses," the poets [32-34]. The very fact of naming the victor in the epinician ode overcomes the potential threat of "oblivion" brought by silence. Pindar comes close to an explicit formulation of this principle in the proem of Nemean 7: "If one hits the mark in his actions, he has thrown a honeyed reason (for song) upon the streams of the Muses. For great acts of valor have much darkness, being in need of songs. But we know a mirror for noble deeds in one way, if, through Memory of the bright headband, one finds compensation for toils in glorious singing of poems" [11-16]. Memory, Mnemosyne, is surrounded by an aureole of light ("bright head- band"; cf. "mirror'" that itself dispels the "darkness" [skotos] of which Pindar warns. Closely associated with Memory is the kleos that preserves the name and the deeds in the "heard" songs of poets [cf. klutais epeon aoidais 16]. Thus in reporting the name of the dead kinsman Socleides in Nemean 6 (cited above), Pindar overdetermines the defeat of lethe. He makes the "cessation of forgetfulness" an explicit topic of his poetry [epause lathan Saokleida, Ne- 16For the metaphor of the "flowers" of song see Slater, Lexicon to Pindar, s.v. anthos. Note too the metaphor of the victor's family "blooming in their excellences" just after Pindar's promise to celebrate them with his song in lines 3-5 here, and also his "petals of song" later in line 29. SZFor the implications of zophos see Austin 92-97. The only other occurrence of the word in Pindar refers to the outer darkness beyond the pillars of Heracles that is "not passable" for mortals, (Nem. 4: 69). 72</page><page sequence="9">mean 6: 20], and at the same time he actualizes that negation of lethe by the specific name, "Socleides," in his verse. In more general terms, the name of the victor and his family, always prominent in the ode, is a particularized, localized manifestation of two recurrent topics in the Epinicia: (1) the cluster of themes that involve Memory, kleos, song, and "truth"; and (2) the motif of naming (onomazein and derivatives) in myths of birth and creation. 5 Four odes-Olympian 7, Olympian 6, Pythian 9, and Isthmian 6-formulate issues relating to poetic creation in terms of interconnected myths of birth and origins. Here too there are a number of important thematic resemblances with the founding myth of Olym- pian 10. In Olympian 7 Zeus apportions the world, but Rhodes is "not yet visible" in the depths of pontos, the untraversed waste of the sea [Olympian 7: 55-57].18 Helios, god of the sun's radiance, however, discerns it and claims it as his own, thereby obviating the necessity for Zeus to make a second allotment [61ff.]. The emergence of the island, therefore, takes the form, simultaneously, of "remembering," as Helios calls its existence to Zeus's memory [mnasthenti 61]; of birth as the island "grows" within a kind of watery womb "from its base within the sea" [endon thalassas/auxanomenan pedothen, 62]; of emergence into the light after "concealment" in the depths [cf. 57 and 67]; and finally of emergence into "Truth" as words become the sign of the accomplished passage between being and non-being: teleuta- then de logon koruphai en alatheia petoisai; blaste men ex alos hugras nasos, echei de nin oxeian ho genethlios aktinon pater, pur pneonton archos hippon. [Falling in truth, the peaks of words were fulfilled; and from the liquid sea there grew forth the island, and the procreative father of the sharp rays, ruler of the fire-breathing horses, holds her. 68-71] Celestial fire now replaces the watery darkness at the beginning of the myth, when the island was "not yet visible in the sea's tract but had been hidden in its salty depths" [55-57]. The repetition of the word "island," [nesos] here [57] and later, near the end of the myth [70], points up the fact that what was previously land hidden by water undiscovered and unknown, even to Father Zeus, is now "held" as firm reality by the "generative father" of the fiery light in the sky [70-71]. The solid presence of the land, visible in the light, now corresponds to the crystalliza- tion of language as the mark of a "truth" that has the solidity and certainty of achieved fact: "The peaks of words were accomplished, falling in truth" [aletheia, 68-69]. These "peaks of words" confirm the validity of the "ancient tales of men" that "speak" to introduce the myth: phanti d'anthropon palaiai/resies, 54 f]. At the same time this "falling in truth" is symmetrical with the upward ascent of the island from the sea's bottom [pedothen, 62] to the rays of the sun [70]. The paradox of an ascent which "falls" is underlined by the periphrasis, "peaks of words," to denote the accomplishment of the tale. As in the watery birth of the emblem of poetry in Nemean 7: 77-79, this creative act stands at the intersection of opposites: "falling" and ascent to the heavens; water and fire; concealment and luminosity; forgetfulness and the "truth" of non-oblivion [cf. 61 and also the "cloud of forgetfulness" in 44-45]. Earlier in Olympian 7 there is another myth of birth, Athena's emergence from the head of Zeus. This birth also implicates cosmogonic reaction, for the primordial divinities, 18 For pontos see above note 11. On its associations with emergence from a primordial chaos see Rubin 77ff. diacritics / summer 1986 73</page><page sequence="10">Ouranos and Gaia, shiver as the goddess comes forth from the head of Zeus [cf. koruphan, 36, and logon koruphai, 68; also kephala, 67].19 Cosmogonic creation is carefully interlocked with the political and religious founding of the city and its god-given skills of superlative craftsmanship, for the scene shifts abruptly from Athena's birth to the sacrifice that the Rhodians are about to make to Athena, under Helios' supervisions, on the acropolis. They forget to bring fire: "a cloud of forgetfulness" [lethe] descends upon them [45], and they make fireless offerings [47]. Zeus then covers the Rhodians with a "yellow cloud, and rained much gold" [49-50], and Athena gave them the gift of surpassing skill in handicrafts [49-53]. Pindar chooses this moment for his flashback to the myth of origins, the birth of Rhodes from the sea. In both this tale and in the fireless offerings on the Rhodian acropolis forgetting is overcome by a powerful celestial father's act of remembering. The "cloud of forgetfulness" that prevents the Rhodians from bringing fire is cancelled out by the "yellow cloud" of Zeus's golden rain [49-50]. That golden cloud, in turn, corresponds to the golden snowfall that envelops the city on the occasion of Athena's birth [34-37]. The "fireless rites" too [48] are not only made good by Zeus's miraculous rain of gold, but also are answered by the emergence of Rhodes from the darkness of the sea's bottom to marriage with Helios, "generative father of sharp rays" [701 and ruler of horses that "breathe fire" [71]. The creative agency of birth and the negation of oblivion operate in widening circles of analogy, from cosmogonic to political and cultic to technological creation. At the same time the spatial field of the myths widens to incorporate the major areas of divine and human ac- tivity: Olympus and the heavens (with a glance at the cosmic space of the personified Ocean and Earth in 38); the mortal realm of Rhodes' acropolis, embodying human, civic and cultic space in 42ff; the formless submarine world of nascent creation prior to the division of the world in 55-70. To leave the sea for light is also to enter the realm of the father and the formed civic and ritual space under his dominion. Thus Athena's birth, like the birth of Rhodes, stands firmly under the control of the father. She leaps forth "from the topmost part of Zeus's head" [36f.]. Immediately afterwards Helios, as the god who "gives light to mortals" [39], establishes a sacrificial rite in her honor, as an act of kindness toward "both father and daughter" [patri te ... kora te, 43]. The "golden snowfall" with which Zeus drenches the city [34 and 49-50] closely parallels the founding of the Olympian games in Olympian 10: 51. The civic rite comes into being as a kind of birth from the male, an emergence from an encompassing liq- uid mass emanating directly from the sky-god [cf. breche, "drenched," 34; cf. 49-50]. As in the founding myth of Olympian 10 and the celestial ascent of Rhodes from the sea here, masculine control presides over the potentially feminine imagery of water. This "drenching" snow or rain has the function of the sky-god's impregnating rain falling upon the expectant Earth in cosmogonic myths like that of Aither and Gaia.20 Pindar himself adapts this myth to the birth of Heracles in Isthmian 7: 5-7, where Alcmene "receives the greatest of the gods as he snows with gold at midnight." Coming from Zeus, bestower of timeless gifts of permanent value, this enveloping snow or cloud in Olympian 7 consists of immortal gold [34, 50; cf. 4] and is thus both metallic and celestial [cf. Olympian 1: 1ff.]. In Olympian 6, as in Olympian 7, the "generative father's" act results in a permanent foundation: a political and technological foundation in the case of Rhodes, a cultic founda- tion in the case of lamus. The latter myth, however, is the more limited tale of a mortal birth. Founder of a line of prophets that bears his name, lamus has the familiar birth of the hero (Perseus, Oedipus, Heracles, Cyrus, and so on; see Rubin, 80-83). It is told in two phases. 19For other aspects of the birth of Athena and particularly its relation to the myth of MWtis in Hesiod see Rubin 71ff, drawing on Vernant and Detienne, chapter 4. For a recent study of the myth in the ode as a whole, with bibliography, see Bernardini 163ff. 20Cf. Aeschylus, Danaids, frag. 44 (Nauck, ed. 2); Euripides, frag. 898 (Nauck); Lucretius 1: 250ff. For the interaction of the two acts of procreative rain from Zeus in O0. 7 see Rubin 74, with note 27, who. stresses mythical motif of "impregnating rain as the male generative principle." The passive verb, brecheto, in 01. 10:51 b, "The Kronion was drenched with abundant snowfall," unlike the active breche, "(Zeus) drenched," (my emphases in both cases) in 01. 7: 34, puts the male procreative energy somewhat in the background. This difference of emphasis is in keeping with the more explicit emphasis on birth in the "first-birth ritual" and the presence of the Moirai in 01. 10. 74</page><page sequence="11">First is the illegitimate birth, in secret, by the mother, Euadna, whom Apollo has im- pregnated. Then follow the infant's "nurture" in a "limitless thicket" and his discovery and ac- ceptance by the maternal grandfather, Aipytos [44-57]. The second phase is half again as long as the first and constitutes, in effect, a figurative second birth: the emergence from the "limitless thicket" of the magical nurture, "drenched over his soft body by the yellow and all- crimson rays of violets" [55-56; on the motif of the second birth, see Stern, 335f]. This sec- ond phase culminates in the act of receiving an "immortal name" (onum'athanaton), which is the subject of an etymological word-play, for "la-mus" is derived from the ia, "violets," whose "yellow and purple rays" have "drenched" the body of the new-born as if in a primor- dial creative dew.21 Although the name is conferred by the mother [56b], the paternal forces behind the creative process (as in Olympian 7) are heavily overdetermined. Euadna's story begins with Poseidon's union with her mother, Pitana, to produce her [29]. Apollo is prominent as the father of lamus and in several other roles. He sends the birth-goddesses to attend the coming forth of his son [41]; and his prophecy contrives the recognition and legitimation of lamus [36], thereby effecting a successful version of his bungled intervention in Euripides' Ion. Euadna's male guardian, the grandfather, has strong paternal authority as the angry parent who sends to Delphi "with sharp concern, holding down in his heart anger unspeakable" [37].22 Finally, in the telescoped life-history of lamus from birth to the hebe of adolescence, both divine father-figures, Poseidon and Apollo, are present to usher him into the realm of masculine success, achievement, and honor [tima, 60] as he leaves the maternal home for the place where he will himself enter upon his deeds of legend and history at Olympia. The bestowal of the name stands at the transitional point between the mysterious thicket of the birth and the wider realm of male achievement: "Therefore his mother declared him to be called this name immortal for all time." The "immortal name," derived from the violets of the previous line is emphatically enjambed to the opening of the epode and thus constitutes the formal bridge between the moment of birth and the "eternity" [56-57] of the hero's glory, which in turn assures the "fame" of the race descended from him ["much-famed race of the lamids," polukleiton genos lamidan, 71]. These lines also form the bridge between the shelter of the maternal thicket and the achievements sanctioned and en- couraged by the divine father and grandfather, Apollo and Poseidon. The hero's maturation follows upon his movement from the "unlimited" and the "hid- den" in the enclosure where the birth takes place [kekrupto, apeiritos, 54], which is also associated with liquid envelopment and "nurture" [55], to an "immortal name" and a journey to a meeting-place with paternal energy and action. This collocation of birth, emergence from liquid, and journey to the father corresponds, mutatis mutandis, to Rhodes' emergence from "concealment" in the depths of pontos to visibility and "truth" in the "bright aether."23 If the adjective alibaton in lamus' arrival at the "steep rock of the high Kronion" (hikonto d'hupseloio petran alibaton Kroniou, Olympian 6: 64) also means "sun-trodden," as Laura Nash suggests [Nash 110-16], then there is an even stronger parallelism with the birth of Rhodes from liquid immersion to celestial, and indeed solar, brilliance. The story of Apollo in Pythian 9 culminates in the birth of the pastoral deity Aristaeus. Here too there are two stages, parturition and nurture. The act of giving a name, bestowed (as in the case of lamus) in close association with mother figures, has a climactic position. Masculine authority and achievement enframe the traditional female tasks of birth and nur- ture. Chiron relates how the nymph Cyrene, whom Apollo is contemplating lustfully, will 21 There is a further etymological play, as the word ion in 55 could also refer to the "venom" or "poison" of the bees. In this respect the thicket, with its potentially dangerous "concealment," is also a place of coincidentia oppositorum, a place where birth and death cross. There may be still another etymological play, as ion can evoke ion, the participle of the verb "to go," looking forward to lamus' journey (cf. 64). 22Thus Stern, "Myth of Olympian 6," 333 suggests that the grandfather Aipytos "must have been in the original form of the myth not the fosterfather, but the actual father," thereby taking the role of the father who fears overthrow or destruction from the birth of the son, as in in myths of Oedipus, Achilles, Perseus, Cyrus, etc. 23The pattern is doubled in Olympian 6: 57-63 by the adolescent lamus'"going down to the middle of the Alpheus ... under the night sky," from which he is sent forth to the public space of ritual ("to the place common to all') and action by the voice of his father. diacritics / summer 1986 75</page><page sequence="12">"give birth to a child" [59]. Hermes will then bring the infant to the Horai and Gaia "from this dear mother" [61]. They will look on him admiringly on their knees and "drip nectar and am- brosia upon his lips," thereby making him immortal [62-63]. As in Olympian 6, this action constitutes a kind of second birth, although here it is into immortality rather than the realm of heroic action only. The movement from birth to immortality is marked by the progression from "give birth to a child" in 59 to "Zeus immortal and pure Apollo" in 63f. As in Olympian 6 too, this second birth is heavily overdetermined by paternal roles: the child is to be "a Zeus immortal and a holy Apollo" and "a joy to men" [63-64]. The whole story, furthermore, is told as a prophecy by Chiron, a traditional foster-father in myths of the hero. Naming con- cludes his prophecy, and kalein, "calls," is his last word [65]. This divine child belongs to the wild as Agreus but is also helpful to mortals [64]. His double nature reflects his father's act of taming and civilizing in marriage the half-wild girl Cyrene who scorns domestic arts inside and prefers instead to battle wild beasts on the mountains [agrioi theres, 21-22; cf. 58 and Agreus, 65]. Male and female roles thus inter- change in complementation (as often in Pindar) rather than conflict. Apollo, god of the civil- ized arts and divine knowledge [42 ff.], will make the mountain-dwelling huntress "ruler of city" [archepolis 54] and mother of a child who supervises both hunting and agriculture [58, 64-65]. Perhaps Cyrene's strong association with the wild requires the maternal function to be displaced in part upon the goddesses of the life-processes, the Earth and the Seasons.24 It is they who confer immortality (after the model of Zeus and Apollo, 63-64), whereas it is Apollo who confers the civilized status of"city-ruling" on Cyrene (Note the repetition, "make ruler of a city" and "make immortal" in 54 and 63 [theseis, thesontai]). As Chiron's prophecy implies, the moment of naming holds the numinous transition between being and non- being, the point when man stands close to the creative forces associated with birth itself and therefore close to the power of divinity. Naming, prophecy, birth, and heroic action come together in a similar collocation in the myth of the birth Ajax in Isthmian 6. Heracles, seeking companions for the first expedi- tion against Troy, stops at the house of Telamon, who invites him to join the meal that is about to begin. Heracles pours a solemn libation to his father Zeus and prays that his host may have a strong son. At once Zeus replies with the omen of an eagle. Heracles feels the thrill of joy or favor [charis] at this confirmed connection with divinity and with his own high paternity. The narrative shifts back to vivid direct discourse as Heracles "speaks like a prophet" and predicts that Telamon will have the son of his prayers. He is to name [eponumos 54] the boy Aias after the omen of the eagle [aietos; cf. 53-54]. The importance of naming is underlined by the repetition of the verb kalein, "call," "address," at significant points in the action (kaleon, keklesato, kekleu 35, 37b, and 53b). The motif of magical first beginnings in the birth is also emphasized by Heracles' invocation of "the very first of his trials" pamproton aethl6n, 48), his battle with the Nemean lion, at the moment of his prayer. This motif has been prepared for, in turn, by his entrance with the lion's skin [37]. As in Pythian 9 and (less directly) in Olympian 6, the supernatural power of male proph- ecy subsumes the female act of parturition. Although Ajax's mother, Eriboea, is mentioned [45], the emphasis is on the paternal lineage. This again is heavily overdetermined through Heracles' appeal to his father, Zeus, in foretelling the birth of a heroic son for Telamon (o Zeu pater, 42b). The various elements in the narrative are all homologous expressions of male heroes' privileged contact with divinity: the gathering of the followers of Telamon (called by his patronymic, Aeacides) for the libation at the banquet; Heracles' search for companions for the heroic expedition against Troy; his first victory, the "trial" of the Nemean Lion; the success of the prophecy in bestowing a name validated by an omen from Zeus; and the potency of birth itself. The father's procreative power dominates both cosmogonic and political creation in the myth of Olympian 9, composed for a victor of Opuntian Locris. This founding myth, like several of the others discussed earlier, has two stages. First Pyrrha and Deucalion repopulate the earth, "by the apportionment of Zeus of the flashing thunder" (aiolobronta Dios aisa) 24Cf. the role of the foster-mother and nurse assumed by Demeter (in disguise) toward the infant Demophon in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. 76</page><page sequence="13">when they "come down from Parnassus" after the flood [42-44]. This procreative act takes place "without sexual union" [44]. Like the other acts of divine procreation studied above, it is marked by a significant name: the "people" [laoi] are "named" as such from laas, "stone," because they are a "stony race" [lithinos gonos, 44-46]. To this primordial creation the whole of the present human race owes its origins. Yet, as in Olympian 7, the creative act also has a local manifestation, specific and limited. This is the union of Zeus, later, with Protogeneia ("she of the first birth'") to beget Opus, the eponymous hero of the Opuntian Locrians (for the problem of the genealogy of Protogeneia and other aspects of the myth, with bibliography, see Bernadini, Mito e attualitb 141ff.). The structure of the two myths, the one remote and universal, the other closer in time and narrower in scope, has a close correspondence in the two procreative acts of the Seventh Olympian: the birth of Athena, at which Ouranos and Gaia shudder, and the watery birth of Rhodes, with its local significance for the Rhodian victor. Here too the second birth is connected with creation from a watery chaos, for Pindar closely interweaves the birth of Opus with the ebb- ing of the waters that "flooded the black earth" [Olympian 9: 50-61; cf. Olympian 7: 54-71]. (In both cases too this myth is presented as the result of ancient "saying" or legend: Olympian 9.49, 7.54). The non-sexual procreation of the "stony offspring" by Pyrrha and Deucalion cor- responds to the male parthenogenesis by which Zeus creates Athena in Olympian 7. In both odes the anthropomorphic heterosexual union follows upon a male creative act that has cosmogonic implications. This second, heterosexual union constitutes the actual founding act for the human civic community: Helios couples with Rhodes in Olympian 7: 71 (meichtheis, "mingling with"), and Zeus unites (meichthe, "mingled with") with Protogeneia here [Olympian 9: 59]. That second union, after the manner of Olympian loves, has its violent aspect: Zeus "snatches away" the girl (anharpasas, 58; cf. Poseidon's similar "snatch- ing up" of Pelops in Olympian 1.40, harpasai). But the mating itself is peaceful [hekalos meichte, 58-59]; and Zeus' motive is not lust but preventing an ancient race from dying out. After the union "among the ridges of Mt. Maenalus," Zeus "brought her to the hero Locrus, lest age lay hold of him and fasten upon him a lot deprived descendants" [60ff.]. As in the other odes that we have examined, the two generative acts of Olympian 9- repopulating the earth after the flood and siring Opus-culminate in the bestowing of a name: the "naming" of the new human race from the stones and the naming of Opus after his mother's father [laoi d'onumasthen, 46; ekalese min isonumon emmen 63-64]. Protogeneia, who introduces the myth of the flood ("Bring our tongue to the town of Protogeneia," 42), is etymologically "she of the first birth." The name resembles the adjective protogonos at the "first-birth ritual" that celebrates the founding of the Olympian games in Olympian 10: 51. (Protogone also appears as an epithet of Persephone and Protogonos as an epithet of the cosmogonic divinity of Orphic hymns.) Pindar repeats the word "first" soon after mentioning Protogeneia, when Deucalion and Pyrrha "establish their first home" after the flood [44]. At the end of this section of the myth he recalls this foundation "from the beginning," archathen [55]. This archa alludes, in fact, to the new "beginning" that followed upon the ebbing of the flood waters "by the arts of Zeus" [52f.]. We may recall the reference back to "earlier beginnings" (archais proterais) in Olympian 10: 78. This phrase too rounds off the foundation myth and harks back to the Kronion's emergence from its "nameless" state Kna11Lx teky4thos diacritics / summer 1986 77</page><page sequence="14">with Heracles' intervention (eponumian charin, "the grace of naming," Olympian 10: 78; cf. nonumos, "nameless," Olympian 10: 51). The continuity in Olympian 9 between the primordial creation of the remote past and the political foundations in the nearer (though still mythical) history of Opus forms part of the conventional praise of the victor's homeland in the Epinician [see Thummer, 1.55-65, especially 57f. on Olympian 9]. Thus the story of Deucalion and Pyrrha appears both as the legend of a foundation ("Thus the two of them founded, ktissasthan, a stony race of people'") and as a flood myth wherein the solid, formed earth emerges from the watery chaos as the deluge subsides (cf. 49-51, "They say that the force of water flooded over the black earth"). The narrative moves immediately from the ebbing of the flood waters to the heroic ancestors of the Opuntian Locrians: "Your ancestors of the brazen spear came forth from them [i.e., from Deucalion and Pyrrha] at the beginning" [archathen] (53-55). The antiquity of origins is further emphasized in the next lines by tracing Deucalion's ancestry back to his grandfather, the Titan lapetos, and to Kronos. The description of the flood itself, though brief, firmly asserts the motif of primal origins: legonti man chthona men kataklusai melainan hudatos sthenos, alla Zenos technais anapotin exaiphnas antlon helein. They say that the force of water flooded over the black earth, but that by Zeus's devices the floodwater took an ebbing back. [49-51] The epic formula "black earth" and the suggestion of cosmic forces in the phrase "strength of waters" enhance the atmosphere of remote beginnings. For a moment we see a world of elements not yet fully crystallized into the anthropomorphic order of personalized divinities. "The devices of Zeus" in the next verse, to be sure, reveals the guiding Olympian hand; but, even so, the impersonal watery flow and ebb, as the subject and object of the sentence, re- tain the emphasis; and "Zeus's devices" is an instrumental dative. 6 In the four Olympian odes discussed above, 6, 7, 9, and 10, the act of naming accom- panies the emergence of a city or an institution. In all four works the creation passes from an unformed state of liquid immersion into the light of birth. A related narrative pattern occurs in several other myths of creating order, founding cities, or inventing new arts. In three myths-the story of Perseus in Pythian 12, of Typhos in Pythian 1, and of Ixion in Pythian 2 - the defeat of a dangerous or monstrous figure is a prerequisite for the creation of order and thus parallels the achievement of the athletic victor. All of these myths also involve the act of naming. The story of Perseus in Pythian 12, the earliest of these odes, has the simplest form. Pin- dar weaves together the hero's killing of Medusa with Athena's invention of the flute. By im- itating the wail of the dying Medusa, Athena creates the "tune of many heads," the polykephalos nomos [23]. The repetition of the verb "invented" or "discovered," heure, at both the beginning and end of the story of Medusa's death (7 and 22) closely interlocks the heroic deed of monster-slaying with the new musical creation. Repeating the verb yet a third time in resumptive repetition in line 22, Pindar moves on at once to the naming of the new sound: heuren theos, alla nin heurois'andrasi thnatois echein, onumasen kephalon pollan nomon, euklea lassoon mnaster' agonon ... 78</page><page sequence="15">The goddess invented it; but inventing it for mortal men to have, she named it the tune of many heads, a famed incentive to contests at which the people gather. [Pythian 12: 22-24] 25 As in Nemean 6: 20, discussed above, the word euklees, "famed," follows logically from over- coming oblivion by bestowing a name. The name preserves the record of the hero's deed among men for time to come and, with the goddess's help, enables it to live as a kleos. The reeds from which Athena fashioned the new instrument have a vital role in that preservation: they are "the trusty witnesses of the chorus-singers" and "dwell beside the Graces' city of the lovely dancing-place, in the precinct of Cephisus' daughter" [26-28]. The urban and the sacral setting, the presence of the Graces, divinities of song, and the reference to "witnesses" all insure the continuity that Athena's aid to Perseus' victory will have "among mortal men" [22]. The remembering of the "glory" [euklees, 24; cf. martures, "witnesses," 28] is effected simultaneously through the material instruments of the song (the reeds as "witnesses") and its contents (the tale itself). Pythian 1 opens with the theme of origins. The "Golden Lyre, joint possession of Apollo and the Muses" on Olympus, is the "beginning of radiance," aglaias archa. As elsewhere in Pindar, archa is a powerful and important word [Olympian 10.78; Olympian 11.5; Pythian 4. 70; Pythian 10.10; Nemean 1.8; frag. 194 Bowra (= 205 Snell)]. Here the "step" (basis, 2b) of the present choral song, "hearing" the Golden Lyre on Olympus, is identified with this "beginning of radiance." It is thus a momentary realization of a divine brilliance of art that is always present on Olympus. In the eternity of the gods each moment is a new, never ex- hausted beginning. For the Golden Lyre there is an infinite succession of such archai. The long description of the Lyre's music on Olympus in the following lines [5-12] con- cretizes the ordering power of song in moral as well as aesthetic effects. The lyre can calm the raw power gathered around the throne of Zeus, but it terrifies the enemies of the Olym- pian order. This two-sided aspect of music is expressed formally in the transition between the proem and the myth of Typhos. Apollo and the Muses at the beginning of the strophe are answered by Apollo and the Muses at the end of the antistrophe [1-2 and 12]. But the epode introduces the motif of Typhos with the power of music to frighten "those whom Zeus does not hold in a state of friendship" when they "hear the shout of the Pierian ones" [14]. This line reveals the other side of "hearing" the Muses' Lyre in line 2 [tas akouei men basis, 2; boan Pieridon aionta 13-14]. If the Lyre shows the cosmic order in its achieved, exemplary status, an eternal model pervading the world in the form of music, the Typhos myth shows that order as process, coming into being through the Olympian ruler's struggle to suppress the refractory violence that still lingers in the world. The former operates through the paradigmatic axis of the ode, the latter along the syntagmatic axis as we see the moral order realized in time, from Typhos to the noisy battle cry of the Etruscans and Carthaginians at Cumae [72 ff.]. The myth of Typhos' defeat unrolls along the syntagmatic axis in a gradual progression toward order, from the world's early beginning to the present time. But the imposition of order also organizes the entire poem along the paradigmatic axis; and the motif of hearing, again, at the end of the second strophe [akousai, 26b; cf. akouei, 2] keeps us aligned along that axis with the order-imposing power of music. The cosmogonic and moral dimensions of this order appear as completed states also in the perfective aspect under which Typhos is shown to us, fixed in bondage, first "lying in dread Tartarus" [hos t'en aina Tartaro keitai, 15], then "having been bound" and "made to recline" against the earth [dedetai'potikeklimenon, 27, 28b]. At this point of achieved order it is appropriate for the poet to utter his prayer to Zeus 25 Possibly the elaborate periphrasis, "incentive for contests," or literally, "wooer to contests," may be a play on the root of "remembering" or "commemoration," mna-: see the scholion on Isth. 2: 5. For the problems of interpreting the phrase see Kdhnken 263, who translates it "herald of contests." For the motif of bestowing the invention on the mortal race cf. also the myth of the birth of Agreus/Aristaeus in Pyth. 9: 64. diacritics / summer 1986 79</page><page sequence="16">[29], thereby harking back to the source of authority and power (cf. Zeus's scepter in 6b and the alliance of the voice of the Pierides with Zeus's terrifying of his enemies in 13). While he invokes Zeus in the second person, Pindar simultaneously names Hieron's new foundation of Aetnaea [30], the manifestation of order and regal authority in a specific political event among men. The act of naming this colony, again in the context of Zeus's presence in the volcano that has suppressed Typhos, pulls into the sphere of language the creative energy for which Aetna has been the locus in the previous narrative [29-31]: 0 Zeus, may it happen, may it happen to be pleasing to you who tend this moun- tain, brow of the fruitful earth, whose name is borne by the city near-by that the glorious founder has honored (tou men eponumian/kleinos oikister ekudanen polin). Recurring emphatically as a source for naming a civic foundation, Aetna serves as both the instrument of asserting the Olympian order and as an emblem of that order, homologous in function with the Golden Lyre. In this latter respect it is (also like the Lyre) a point of in- tersecting opposites: force and gentleness, fire and snow, nurture and violence, earth and water, water and fire [20-26]. As the "heavenly pillar" [19b] that extends from Hades to Olympus, it is also a specific geographical manifestation of a total order, reaching through three major vertical domains of the world: Hades, earth, and heavens.26 Aetna mediates not only between opposing spaces and elements but also temporally between the mythical and the contemporary event, between the eternal potentiality of order on Olympus and its realization in the historical victory over the enemies of Hellas at Cumae. Pindar thus surrounds the contemporary achievements of Hieron's reign with the creative energies that brought about the present order of the world. The new colony's very name recalls the ancient founding act, as it were, of the remote mythical time when Zeus used "Aetna" [20] to battle the Titans. The present thus becomes transparent to what Mircea Eliade calls illud tempus, the time of first beginnings when the creative forces of the universe enter human life and begin to shape the world-order.27 Pindar harks back to the act of naming again as he closes this section of the myth and turns from Zeus to Phoebus Apollo. The city that he is celebrating is "of glorious name," onumastan, thanks to the Pythian victory that occasioned the ode [38]. Thus he associates the founding and the naming of Aetnaea, and the present athletic victory too, with Zeus's defeat of Typhos. That creature's very name implies chaos rather than orderly human dwell- ing: he was nurtured in a "cave of many names" [17]. The multiplicity of names contrasts with the specific name that glorifies the present foundation [30, 38].28 Stability radiates outward from the Lyre, passing from Olympus to the place of its terrify- ing effects on the monster. In terms of the spatial coordinates of the ode, Cuma marks the horizontal extension of the sprawled monster's length in the divine (mythical) order [18-19], just as Hieron's victory in that same locale [70-75] extends to war and politics the order that emanates from Zeus as it initially manifested itself in the music of the present celebration of the athletic triumph [1ff.]. Pindar, therefore, introduces the military victory by another prayer to Zeus [67; cf. 29] and another reminder of musical order, the "harmonious calm" (sum- phonos hasychia, 70b) that he invokes for Hieron's city. At the very end of the ode a contrast of sounds again distinguishes rightful and wrongful regal authority: the bellowing of Phalaris' cruel bronze bull that brings a "hostile fame" to its inventor, and the songful lyre that preserves the fame of an upright king like Croesus [92-99]. The tale of Ixion in Pythian 2 is a negative creation myth. It illustrates the patterns that 26For this aspect of Aetna in the ode and its mythical associations see my Tragedy and Civilization: An Interpretation of Sophocles 22; also my remarks on Pyth. 1 in Cambridge History of Classical Literature 228-31. 27See M. Eliade, Cosmos and History: the Myth of the Eternal Return, especially 34ff. and 73ff. For Pin- daric applications see Rubin 76-79. 28The multiplicity of the name parallels the remote Cilician origin of the monster as a correlate of his disorderly status: Greek vs. barbarian; glorious name vs. multiple names; city vs. cave. Cf. "Cilician Typhos of the hundred heads" in Pyth. 8: 16. 80</page><page sequence="17">we have been discussing, but in an inverted form. Ixion is an evil culture-hero. He is the very first [protistos, 32] to introduce the shedding of kindred blood. His attempt to lie with Hera produces another negative creation, the "four-spoked bond" of his wheel of punishment in Hades (ton tetraknamon desmon, 40). As a perverted form of the lovecharm of the iynx (see Detienne, Les Jardins d'Adonis 167), this instrument is the fitting punishment for one who would bring seduction into the house of the goddess who embodies the solemnity of mar- riage [ibid., 170ff.]. The resultant birth is "without the Graces" [42], as the cloud-image that Zeus puts in Hera's place "gives birth alone to an overweaning offspring that stands alone" [42].29 In births sanctioned by the gods, the Moirai "stand by" (parestan men ara Moirai schedon, Olympian 10: 52; so too Olympian 6.42; Nemean 7.1; cf. Pythean 3.9, 4.145). The isolation of this birth (emphasized by the repetition of monos, "alone," 43) shows its unhallowed character and also marks the removal of both parents and offspring from the order of law, city, and human family life. The birth of Ixion's offspring, Kentauros, like that of lamus in Olympian 6, is accom- panied by the mother's act of naming. The cloud-image fashioned by Zeus "nurtures" the child and "names it Kentauros" [44], much as Euadna confers the "immortal name" upon her son at the "second birth" from the thicket [Olympian 6: 56-57]. This act of naming, however, is bestowed on a creature "without honor" [geras] among gods or men [43]. Lacking such honor, this offspring has its affinities not with the aletheia that could evade dark oblivion, but with pseudos, falsehood. Ixion has embraced "a sweet falsehood" [37]. The insubstantiality of this mist-formed mate- stressed by the collocation of the participle methepon, "handling" or "fondling," with the elusive pseudos gluku, "sweet deception"- prepares for the anomaly of the ill-famed fruit of the union. Thus the procreative process here does not lead to the "im- mortal" realm of the gods or to the founding of a city or to an oracular prediction, but rather to the "wondrous hoard" of strange, half-bestial creatures. The "wondrous band" perversely follows the Greek ideal of resemblance to both of the parents [48]. But "likeness" [homoioi] is here akin to the deception (by false resemblance) practised by Zeus and to the division between divine and mortal rather than to moral unity or harmony.30 Resemblance is part of the insubstantiality of the "sweet lie" of the cloud with which Zeus punishes Ixion: "In form it resembled the daughter of Kronos, highest of heavenly ones" [eidos gar huperochotata prepen Ouranian/thugateri Kronou, 38-39]. The union of the two parents produces not well proportioned blending of a perfect human form but rather the monstrous combination of beast-men. This miraculous birth completes the series of "first" creations that pervades this portion of the ode. All of these are bad. They are either evil in intent or else result from the punishing or evil. Ixion is the "first" to fabricate the device [techne] whereby he "mingled kindred blood among mortals" (32, a phrase suggestive of the introduction of blood-pollution). Zeus reacts by shaping the "sweet deception" of the cloud-image, which (like his fabrication of Pandora in Hesiod [Theogony 585, 589, 592, 602; cf. Opera 82] is also "a lovely woe" and a trick [kalon pema, dolos, 37, 39]. Uniting with this fabrication, Ixion brings another invention into being, the "four-spoked bond" that is both a wheel of punishment and an iynx of perpetually frustrated desire. The last item in the chain of disastrous novelties is the hoard of centaurs, whose monstrosity makes them "wondrous" [thaumastos, 47] in a negative sense. This condi- tion corresponds to that of their father, Ixion's child, who is isolated, in both physical and moral terms, being "without honor either among men or in the laws of the gods" [43]. The wild, mountainous locale of Kentauros' mating with the mares [45-46] is ap- propriate to the centaur-brood that he fathers. It stands in sharp contrast to his own father's reception into the "great-hollowed chambers" of Zeus [megalokeutheessin en pote thalamois, 33]. The betrayal of that holy interior by Ixion's "trying the spouse of Zeus" [34] also cor- responds to the unhallowed status of the sexual union (seduction and adultery). The wrongful sexual act by the father is perpetuated in the son, the mating of a male of sup- posedly divine origins with beasts (Kentauros and the mares). By violating the separation and 29 The phrase "without the Graces," also marks the definitive defeat of Ixion in his contest with Zeus: cf. the description of the victorious island of Aegina as "falling not far from the Graces" in Pyth. 8: 2 1: 30For the ambiguity of likeness see P. Pucci's discussion of Hesiod in Hesiod and the Language of Poetry 9ff., 91ff. diacritics / summer 1986 81</page><page sequence="18">the permissible conjunction between man and god, in other words, the presence of rape in these solemn chambers is exactly homologous with the monstrosity that results from the union of a false child of Hera with animals. This movement from gods to beasts is also homologous with the spatial shifts in the story: from Olympus to Hades and from the grand interiors of Zeus's palace [33] to the wild mountain of the centaurs' begetting [45-46]. When we view this narrative against the model provided by other myths of birth, this displacement to the wild appears as just the reverse of what occurs in the case of heroes of good fame. Those tales show a progression toward a city or holy sanctuary from wilderness [Olympian 6], unnamed hillside [Olympian 10], uncharted sea or flood [Olympian 9, Pythian 4], or volcanic mountain [Pythian 1]. Conclusion In viewing these myths of birth and foundation all together, we perforce neglect many of the subtle interconnections and correspondences that Pindar weaves between the athletic victory, the poet's art, and the hero's deeds. But in stressing the similarities of thought, ex- pression, and narrative patterns, we also show, hopefully, how much Pindar, like other ar- chaic poets, relies on an underlying armature of myth that he turns to different purposes and clothes with fresh embellishments as particular circumstances demand. The work of Ver- nant, Detienne, and their colleagues has greatly facilitated the understanding of specific motifs like aletheia, pontos, metis, or the god's immobilization of their enemies in cosmic warfare. More deeply, it has encouraged us to read Greek myth as a coherent structure of densely interrelated patterns and thus to see myth, at least in one of its multiple aspects, as a language of narrative forms whose syntax and particular literary inflexions we can begin to discern.
