As a matter of fact, the anthropomorphic gods which arose upon the basis of solar perceptions did finally happen to prevail. Soma in the later mythology is the moon, and never more, and as such holds a position in the lower pantheon. But Savitar, the inspiring, enlivening principle of the sun, and Tvastar, the divine artificer (according to the author, another solar god), blend with certain more abstract conceptions in Prajapati, 'the lord of the creatures.' And Prajapati, together with his variants Vi9vakarman, 'the fabricator of the universe,' Paramesthin, 'he who occupies the highest summit,' Svayamnbhu, 'the self-existent being,' come as near the realization of monotheism as was ever possible in India. And these, as is well known, in their turn contributed to the development, or perhaps better, caused the development of the neuter brahma into Brahma, the ultimate pantheistic all-god, the final outcome of all Brahmanical speculation. As to the main thesis of Professor Hillebrandt's book there can be no question. The moon is there in all those countless passages which describe Soma either in language so plain that one wonders now how it could ever have been misunderstood, or with a symbolism so fanciful as to remove, in part at least, the wonder. This investigation will help materially in removing the artificial barrier which has, until recent times, been kept around the hymnal literature, to the exclusion of the remaining Vedic and Hindu writings. About the pre-Vedic identity of Soma and the moon, however, I do not feel so certain. Professor Hillebrandt believes that Haoma in the Avesta is also to be identified with the moon, but the proofs which he adduces are few and, to my mind, inconclusive. The treatment of the haoma-plant in the Avesta is not reported with sufficient detail to justify the belief that the same rapproche- ment to the moon took place. The conception of the equivalence of Soma and the moon seems extremely difficult to conceive, if we eliminate the sacerdotal ritual of a highly-developed type, such as the songs of the Rig-Veda presuppose, to my thinking at least. In any case it seems difficult to imagine the identification of the moon with the soma-plant upon a basis of free popular thought. It is speculative; it is Talmudical; it savors of the priestly imag- ination. The presence of it in the Rig-Veda only tends, along with many other related facts, to show how far advanced in this direction 'the Aryan Bible' is. It does not by itself prove that the Indo-Iranians, or perchance the Indo-Europeans, knew of a 'moon-plant' from which they pressed an earthly ambrosia, emulating the gods whose nourishment was constantly replenished in the waning and increasing luminary of the night. MAURICE BLOOMFIELD. Aristophanis Vespae cum prolegomenis et commentariis, ed. J. VAN LEEUWEN, J. F. L.-B., E. J. Brill, 1893. A commentary on the Wasps, says van Leeuwen, is sadly needed. The text is well enough, but exegesis has been neglected. The latest commentary he knows is that of Richter, Berlin, I858, and of Richter's competence as an interpreter of Aristophanes' jests van Leeuwen has a poor opinion, which he 493</page><page sequence="2">494 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. justifies by some specimens of the German's obtuseness. But a commentator who is sufficiently acquainted with English to illustrate Aristophanes by Dickens ought not to have ignored Green, to whom Blaydes refers frequently; ought not to have ignored Rogers, who has dealt with the purpose of the play in an independent spirit and is by no means dead to the facetiae of the comic poet. Rogers does not share the ordinary view that the Wasps is an attack on the dicastic system, nor does he believe that Aristophanes was alive to its defects. He agrees with Fallex in thinking that the Philokleon of the Wasps is the Demos of the Knights in another form; and to him ' The one matter submitted to arbitration is this: Are the dicasts really lords of all, or are they in reality mere tools and slaves of the Demagogues themselves ?' The Wasps 'has for its object,' according to Rogers, 'the rupture of the alliance which existed between the Demagogues on the one hand, and the dicasts who consti- tuted their main support and stay in the popular assemblies, on the other.' But how could such a system be more effectively arraigned than it is arraigned by the caricature of a state trial that forms so large a part of the Wasps ? And how is the desired rupture effected? In the Wasps there is nothing that corresponds to the resipiscence of the Demos in the Knights. The conversion of Philokleon from the error of his ways has no political significance, and the denouement of the Wasps is, as has been said often enough, the denouement of the Clouds turned round. Philokleon is converted by his son as Pheidip- pides is converted by his father, and the fun lies in the bewilderment of the teachers at the success of their instructions. In the Clouds, as we have it, the grimness of the catastrophe checks the merriment, but in the Wasps the outcome is a sheer farce, a sheer bit of self-mockery, such as is highly charac- teristic of Aristophanes, such as is alien to most of the solemn personages who undertake to edit Aristophanes. But to say that the disharmony is part of the play, that the couac is part of the opaera bouffe, would be a thesis utterly unworthy of the philological guild. Nor dare we appeal to the confessions of modern novel-writers, who tell us that their characters once created are utterly independent of their creators, and go their own way, regardless of the wishes of the authors of their being. All this superficiality must be frowned down and orthodox methods followed, to restore the artistic balance of the original Wasps. Needless to say, we have in van Leeuwen's presentation a duplex recensio after the fashion of the Clouds, and the extant Wasps is an opus non integrum sed in fine ab imperita manu infeliciter admodum contaminatum. But into the details of van Leeuwen's theory, into the traces of the duplex recensio and the contaminatio, those words of fear to unphilological readers, and to some philological readers as well, I will not go just now, but a rapid outline may be of interest. As to the general scope of the play, van Leeuwen does not deny, as Rogers denies, that in the Wasps Aristophanes is attacking the dicastic system, but the attack on the dicastic system is a covert attack on Kleon, and as Kleon was the arch-demagogue, van L. and Rogers are not so far apart. Only we must remember that as a poet Aristophanes had to incarnate, had to have a being of flesh and blood for his model. Scratch Demos, scratch Dikaiopolis, and they will bleed. They are not mere personifications; and so it is better to take the concrete Kleon, now that we have him, for the target of Aris-</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTICES. 495 tophanes than the abstract Demagogue. But the concrete Kleon had shown himself a little too concrete for Aristophanes' comfort. He had been assailed in the poet's second play, the Babylonians, and the ogre--6 KapXap66ovq, as Aristophanes calls him-had shown his teeth to some purpose, for in the next play, the Acharnians, the poet's attitude is rather deprecatory. But the success of the Acharnians and the applause of the young Tories embol- dened Aristophanes to a renewed and more effective assault on his enemy. The prudent counsel of his sponsor, Kallistratos, was disregarded, and he proceeded to make shoestrings of the tanner's hide. The Knights is a savage piece, and van Leeuwen thinks that the earnestness of the poet was a disadvantage to his art. There is none of the joyous fun of the Achar- nians. Reprobate though he be, we are all in love with Dikaiopolis, whereas the reformed Demos is as disagreeable an object after he had ceased to be the dupe of the Paphlagonian as he had been before. But for all that the Knights was a great success, in fact too great a success, and was punished by a vindictive lawsuit, in which the Kydathenaian Kleon evidently got the better of the pseudo-Kydathenaian Aristophanes. Kallistratos and Philonides had to come forward as sponsors for the subsequent pieces, and Aristophanes had to seek another field for his comic exercises. This he found in the airy regions of Cloudland, and there he did battle with the new lights of the philosophic firmament-with Sokrates and Chairephon. But he failed-partly because the new education was an old joke, which he himself had used up in the Aatra?S, partly because the new Sokrates was not the old Sokrates that every man, woman and child in Athens was familiar with. Sore at his failure, the poet turned from the unsubstantial and unsatisfying realm of the clouds to the solid earth of public life, where his previous great successes had been won, and went into politics again. But he had not forgotten the lesson that Kleon had taught him, and selected a theme that was full of absurd contrasts and yet one that could be handled without a direct assault on his dangerous foe. Klean had raised the dicast's fee to three oboli, and this advance was such a boon to the poor veterans of the Persian War that they went thronging to the courts as to a Soldiers' Home; and it was this ridiculous contrast between the heroic past of the men of Marathon and their pitiful present that, according to van Leeuwen, made the subject so attractive to the comic poet. One pauses to wonder how many Marathon men, how many Salaminians, were left to serve on the jury. Some of the reminiscences of the chorus, it is true, go very far back, but they are decidedly of the 'bummer' order, and one fails to see the contrast between the heroic youth and the sordid old age of the men of the Persian War, that contrast which is supposed to have furnished so happy a theme for the comic poet. The bummers and the malingerers and the bounty-jumpers of our own war are precisely those who are most eager for pensions, and the sordid old age is only the sequel of a sordid youth. But no one will seriously insist on the chronological exact- ness of the choreutai of the Wasps. They may have stepped down out of the picture in the Stoa Poecile, for all we care. The bummers of the Wasps are quite as real as the Salaminian rearward of the Demos in the Knights, and no more so. Now, in the opening of the piece, Aristophanes, or his mouthpiece Xan-</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. thias, renounces an attack on Kleon as he renounces an attack on Euripides. But he does not keep his word. The Cyclops of Euripides is parodied in the closing scene, and the covert attack on Kleon is changed into an open assault. Surely it would seem that the names of Philokleon and Bdelykleon are frank enough, but van Leeuwen thinks that they might have been explained away. KXeogf would fit KXet6vvlzof and KaeopSv, and Aristophanes might have sheltered himself behind these, if the attack were renewed. To be sure, everybody knew that Kleon was meant, but the poet could set up a fair defence in a court of law, if he were brought up again. After Kleon's death, continues van Leeuwen, there was not the same ground for caution, and when the play was revived, all those drastic passages in which Kleon is directly attacked were introduced, the well-known screed from the Peace was added as a purpureus pannus, and a new conclusion tacked on. So much for van Leeuwen's treat- ment of the play as a whole. Like all such hypotheses, it demands large space for an adequate criticism, and this rdsume, with the occasional comments, must suffice for the present. It is to me always a pleasure to come back to the Wasps, which I have found a good centre of Aristophanic work, and which has been unduly neglected; but in what further space I can steal from my contributors, I will confine myself to some remarks on van Leeuwen's com- mentary. Those who are possessed of the German mania for exhaustiveness might complain that van Leeuwen does not seem to have troubled himself about recent monographic work on Aristophanes and one seldom finds anything that does not belong to the old stock. Of course, he could not well overlook the 'AiOvaiwv 0ro2tre7a, which he discredits here as he has done elsewhere; and the Mimes of Herondas are cited. Of periodical literature there is just one reference to a stray article in the Classical Review, and he has also noticed a recent archaeological monograph. There is no systematic treatment of the metres, though we have an excursus on the measures of v. 273 foll.; nor does the editor discuss the doctrine of the ay6v, though his note on v. 533 is a virtual acceptance of it. The stage directions are very full, and show a disposition to be amused by the action of the Wasps. Unfortunately, full stage directions are apt to be resented by the reader, and every one will remember that the late Dr. Kennedy was a great sinner in this regard. Every right-minded person repels the editorial nudge where the editorial nudge is not needed. The Dutch parallels, on the other hand, with which van Leeuwen enlivens his notes are not unwelcome, and are calculated to give a good impression of the Dutch version for which he is responsible. In matters grammatical van Leeuwen is somewhat hidebound, as one would expect from his habitat, though he is occasionally penetrated by a new observation, such as that made by Seaton in the Classical Review, I889, according to which (see note on v. 269) the iterative av with ind. has its chief home in familiar language. We knew before that it was Attic and not Homeric (Goodwin, M. and T. 249), for in the Homeric passage cited by Kiihner, fP 104 (cf. r I49 and o 139), evtla K,ev has given way to v,Oa icai. Still, we must not be too quick in citing Herodotos for familiar language. In that great artist Xdptg and o^iuiUa were paired (D. Hal. de Admir. vi 1083 R.), and we are never to forget the sophistic element in his style. To cite Herodotos as a naif writer is 496</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTICES. itself naivete.l But perhaps this is pressing a point too much, and one ought not to be too hard on a Dutch Hellenist when he shows openness of mind. Openness of mind, however, is hardly to be asserted of the note on the well- known ypZ0oo with which the play opens: ds6Kcovv TerOv Kara7rrTr6evov eig r7jv iayopav piyav 7ravv avapTraaavra roio bvv tv da7rida (epetv Ekrirxatcov avecag eig rbv oipavbv Ka7rretra ravrz7v irro3a2elv Kfetsvvyiov.-(vv. 15-19.) The whole joke, the whole surprise, lies in the position of the two accusatives with the infinitive-first subject-object, then object-subject-and yet van Leeuwen, who enjoys the jest, as he shows by his punctuation, has the hardihood to say (v. 429) that there was less 6ayt^LoXia in the position of acc. before and acc. after inf., because the acc. before inf. is regularly the object (obiectum tantum non semper praecedit). In the first place it is not true, and in the second place ambiguity is ambiguity. When we invert in English, ambiguity may arise, as when Tennyson says: "It is the land that freemen till, That sober-suited Freedom chose, The land where girt with friends or foes A man may speak the thing he will." But ordinarily it matters not. The context will show. And so with the Greek. But the adi/poT2ia is there, and we are warned against it by the Greeks themselves. See the passages of the Greek rhetoricians cited A. J. P. VI 489, to which add Rhet. ad Alex., c. 25 (Sp. I 212, 6; cf. III 243, I3). In fact, Aisch. Choeph. 886, 7, cited by van Leeuwen, dwells on the ambiguity: OI. TOV c&amp;ivra T Kaive ro3v reOvr,c6CKraag iyw. KA. oi 'yc6. Mvv7Kca roviTrog Ei aivtyf7druv. However, it is fair to say that some commentators do not think that the aivty/ta lies there. Better, it does not lie wholly there. Of the ambiguous passages cited, Ar. Eq. 209 is an oracle, Eur. Med. 679 is an oracle, and in an oracle ambiguity might well be expected. Or are we to follow the example of rule- mongers and say that in oracles the regular order is reversed ? y/ ytvoiro. Add to the examples of subj.-obj. given in this Journal (u. s.) Eur. Tro. 655, 765, where, however, Reiske made a difficulty, Hdt. 3, 45, Ar. R. 31, Plat. Rpb. 6, 506 E, Xen. Cyr. I,4,28. But why multiply passages ? A run through any Greek author will convince the attentive reader that tantum non semper is a mistake. An unlucky attempt to solve the much-discussed form involved in ieFpieyev 11 cannot refrain from quoting here a passage from Kaibel's Stil und Text der IIOAITEIA AOHNAIQN, which fell under my eye as this notice was passing through the press: " Herodot schreibt ja nicht, wie man sich das gelegentlich vorgestellt hat, wie ein naives Naturkind, sein Stil ist das Product mihevoller Kunstubung, und nichts ware unrichtiger als wenn man sich einbilden wollte, seine neun Biicher waren eine Musterprobe der hetL9 etpogtevq " (p. 66). But see the whole passage. To be sure, Boeckh had long ago looked into the heart of Herodotos (Kl. Schr. VII 597), but so long as Herodotos is edited for schools, we shall have the old stock characteristic brought up for the benefit of the youthful mind. 497</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PIILOLOGY. is found in the note on v.

B. L. GILDERSLEEVE. Pindar: the Olympian and Pythian Odes. With Notes Explanatory and Critical, Introductions, and Introductory Essays by C. A. M. FENNELL. New Edition. Cambridge, At the University Press. New York, Mac- millan &amp; Co., 1893. Mr. Fennell's edition of the Olympian and Pythian Odes of Pindar announces itself as a new work, and, though much of the old matter has been retained, the claim is not an idle one. The metres have received considerable attention; the echo theory has been pursued into all its details; and the principle that there must be a symmetry in contents corresponding to the symmetry in form has had a marked effect on the treatment of the structure of the odes. In all these points, however, Mr. Fennell has not only preserved but has been careful to assert his independence. The application of the principle of symmetry has not regularly yielded the results presented in my edition, though the divergences are not startling for the most part. The metrical schemes of the old edition have been abandoned, and the new metric is followed to a certain extent, but Mr. Fennell considers H. Schmidt's results as entirely too definite, and contents himself with recording the various metrical groups as they present themselves to him, and declines to take notice, at least regularly, of such symmetry as his own metrical schemes exhibit. The observation of the responsions has not been favorable to the theories of Mezger and Bury, and the contention of Bulle that there are too many verbal responsions for the catchword theory is confirmed by an almost fatiguing cumulation of examples. Words recurring in exactly the same position as regards metre, or, as Mr. Fennell calls them, 'tautometric' words, he con- siders, as a rule, to be without significance, whereas an obviously significant repetition is generally 'heterometric,' unless more than one word is recalled. At the same time, no explanation of the undeniable frequency of these repe- titions is given beyond vague surmises. In criticism and exegesis Mr. Fennell does not seem to have troubled himself much about the work that lies scattered through journals and disser- tations, and one can imagine the rage of Bornemann when he finds that all 498</page></plain_text>
