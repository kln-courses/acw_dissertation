<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature Kate Soper I All of those working in the broad field of environmental studies (and I here include, among others, philosophers, geographers, political ecologists, sociologists, cultural historians and critics) are likely to agree to two points. First, the term "nature" which has been so central to our various debates, has lost its all-purpose conceptual status and can no longer be bandied around as it once was. This does not mean that we have ceased to use it. Indeed, it still regularly recurs in eco- logical laments and admonitions (it is "nature", after all, that we are being told is being lost, damaged, polluted and eroded; and it is nature that we are enjoined to respect, protect and conserve). But we readily acknowledge now that this is no more than a kind of shorthand: a con- venient, but fairly gestural, concept of eco-political argument whose meaning is increasingly contested. This bears on the second point of presumed agreement, namely, that we can, broadly speaking, discern two main parties to this contest over the nature of nature: the realists on the one hand, and the contructivists on the other. Since this dis- tinction will be familiar to readers in its general outline, I shall not here elaborate in any detail upon it. But a few specifications might be added at this point. One is the importance, as I see it, of drawing some distinction between what may be termed ontological and normative emphases of the divide. From an ontological point of view, the main difference is between those who insist on the independent reality of a natural domain or mode of being, and those who argue that there is no "nature" in this sense and that everything we refer to as natural is in one way or another a construct of human culture. Realists, of course, come in different forms, some more discriminating than others. They include deep ecologists explaining at length about the intrinsic value of the Grand Canyon as well as those no-nonsense environmentalists who rest content with rubbishing the idea that it is language that has a hole in its ozone layer. Only the more discriminating will insist - as, Theoria, December 2001</page><page sequence="2">56 Kate Soper for example, Ted Benton and I have done at some length in our writ- ing on environmental issues - on the importance of differentiating between "deep" and "surface" natures: between that which is the con- dition of all human modifications and the perceptible domain of "nature" which is the outcome of these modifications (whether this be wilderness, cultivated landscape, flora, fauna, the body, etc.).1 The more critical will also make clear that there is nothing that can be thought or talked about as "nature", whether deep structures or sur- face environments, other than in human talk and thought, while insist- ing nonetheless that the talk and thought (whether this be scientific, poetical, eco-political, or whatever) can, and often does, refer to enti- ties or processes conceived as existing independently of their repre- sentation, and in some cases as also unaffected by that representation. Constructivism, too, comes in somewhat differing forms depend- ing whether the stress is placed on the conceptual dependency of the idea of "nature" as a conventional and inherently revisable binary counter to that of "culture", on the social construction of knowledge, or on the human hand in the physical making of much that is loosely referred to by environmentalists as "natural". These senses are obvi- ously not exclusive of each other, and are indeed often run together, although the first is more associated with Derridean or Foucaultian- influenced gender studies and cultural criticism, and the latter two more emphasised in the argument of philosophers of science, cultural geographers, sociologists and political ecologists.2 In my What is Nature? (1995), I suggested that where the realist position (at any rate in its more naive forms) was, normatively speak- ing, "nature-endorsing", in other words, tended to invoke and applaud "nature" as a domain of intrinsic value, truth or authenticity, the con- structivist position was "nature-skeptical": it was wary of the social and sexual policing functions of the appeal to naturality, and sought to expose its misleadingly anthropocentric and anthropomorphic con- ceptual projections. I still think this is a reasonable point to make about the respective normative stances of the two main ontological positions - but only speaking very broadly; and in distinguishing between the ontological and the normative aspects I would mark the fact that there is no direct correspondence between realists and nature-endorsers on the one hand, and constructivists and nature- skeptics, on the other. The constructivist position, for its part, frequently implies or even explicitly suggests that what we think of as "real" or "independent" nature is not so, but rather the product of our conceptual projections</page><page sequence="3">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 57 or material cultural constructions. The normative message here would therefore seem to be: beware of constructs, learn to detect the signs of phony projections of authenticity; the genuine article cannot be represented, or when it is becomes immediately a cultural con- struct. Take, for example, the growing field of ecologically sensitive cultural criticism now known as "ecocriticism", where there is a clear normative overlap between those critics who are reading literary texts as sources of revelation about the intrinsic value of nature or of the importance of restoring human unity with it, and the deconstructive- skeptical type of reading which emphasises the role of culture in the creation of what we term "nature", and seeks to expose the textual registers of dubiously Romantic, or anthropomorphising, or ideo- logically distorting, cultural constructions and representations of nature.3 For both sides here seem to be invoking an "unconstructed" naturality whose otherness must be respected as a source of "truth". It is true, of course, that those explicitly endorsing the "truth" or "value" of nature, or recalling us to a lost unity with it, are engaged in something rather different from those exposing the cultural con- struction of that "truth" or the partial, and historically relative, qual- ity of human feelings for the natural environment. But whether the advice is to "return" to nature, to get "closer" to it, to "dwell authen- tically", and so forth, or to be wary of our own too appropriative rep- resentations of that "closeness" or "authenticity", in both cases, the critical task is presented as a matter of correcting our views about nature or exploring cultural products as guides to a better apprecia- tion of its authentic being. One might also note in this connection the equivocations of the constructivist positions defended in social theory, wherein one fre- quently discerns a suppressed reference to a more realist conception of nature. Take, for example, Donna Haraway's position as exemplified in the opening pages of Simians, Cyborgs and Women , where she writes, neither our personal bodies nor our social bodies may be seen as natural, in the sense of existing outside the self-creating process called human labour. What we experience and theorise as nature and as culture are transformed by our work. All we touch and therefore know, including our organic and social bodies, is made possible for us through labour.4 This appears, on the one hand, to recognise a concept of the "natural" as that which has not yet been "humanised" or worked up through human labour, while on the other hand denying that we could have knowledge of it. But while we might agree that everything by which</page><page sequence="4">58 Kate Soper we are surrounded (everything "touchable") is "cultural construction" in the sense of being a product of labour, it is equally important to acknowledge nature in the realist sense of causal powers and processes enabling and limiting the cultural work; and to accept that even if it is not "touchable" it is nonetheless an object of scientific knowledge: of the kind of knowledge, for example, that is continually in use whether in the creation of machines, computer systems or genetic engineering. The emphasis throughout Haraway's argument on the construction or reinvention of nature leaves it unclear how far she would agree to the existence of a "nature" which is not the cul- tural effect of productive interaction but the prior condition of any such interaction.5 I have a similar problem deciding quite where Steven Vogel stands on this issue in his recent work, Against Nature. Vogel professes to be a constructivist, and indeed tells us in explanation that "to say that nature is 'constructed' is . . . simply a way of saying that an appeal to nature is always nothing other than an appeal to us and to our own dis- cursive processes of justification".6 But within a paragraph, he also refers us to a seemingly quite independent "nature" or "nature in itself", when he writes that "nothing in my argument suggests that humans may not discursively determine that natural entities, or nature itself, possess value". Or again, there seems equivocation in Jane Howarth's criticism of what she sees, in a review of What is Nature ?, as my over reliance on science in my account of the independent reality of nature. Howarth writes that, "it may be true that one cannot be constructivist about nature, but one can be constructivist about science and hence about nature as science presents it". Now if this means, to put it in the vocabulary of Critical Realism, that science is fallible, that there can be rival transcendental arguments to explain natural powers and struc- tures, then this seems quite consistent with my own position, and no criticism of it. But if it means something more like "realist nature can be equally well-represented in any and every theoretical construc- tion", then it is indeed at odds with my own realism; but then it is also, surely, at odds with Howarth's own claim that one cannot be con- structivist about nature - for that is surely precisely what is being claimed if we interpret her argument to mean realist nature has no say in determining which theories most adequately represent it: that the social construction of knowledge can be said to be knowledge while remaining wholly unconstrained by the qualities of that of which it is said to be knowledge.7</page><page sequence="5">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 59 What I am suggesting with all these examples is that such coher- ence as these positions have is sustained ultimately only through some covert gesture to that out of which the construction is constructed - to an aspect of bodily existence or selfhood or reality that is viewed as determinant upon, and not merely the creation of, the social forces and institutions and discourses which are mediating the form of its existence. A realist concept of nature is in this sense a suppressed or repressed ontological presupposition of much that passes for "con- structivism"; and although there are constructivists, like Steven Vogel, who insist on the human production of everything termed "natural" in order to get us to take full responsibility for it,8 constructivists are, normatively speaking, very often covert nature-endorsers. (And ulti- mately even Vogel may be said to be in the sense that in demanding more responsibility for our "constructions" he implies that something is currently going ecologically awry). II But we should note, too, that one can be a realist about nature while both agreeing with the nature-skeptics about the made-over or con- structed nature of surface "nature" and agreeing to the need to reject the discursive violence done in the name of nature and to expose the oppressive naturalisations of social hierarchies, ethnic differences and sexual norms. Indeed, this is very much my own position - which I would describe as both realist and humanist. It is realist, as already indicated, in the sense that it recognises the contrast between the inde- pendent "nature" that is presupposed as the permanent ground of all human activity and environmental change (that which I, in fact, term the "realist" concept of nature), and the "nature" through which we refer to the historically changing and culturally transformed environ- ment (that I term the "lay" or "surface" concept of nature, the nature of immediate human experience and aesthetic response). My position is humanist , on the other hand, in the sense that it is opposed to that form of naturalism which wants to emphasise how similarly (rather than differentially) placed we are to other animals in respect of our "essential" needs and ecological dependencies, and seeks to ground ecological policy in that recognition. On the basis of this both realist and humanist position, I charge the constructivists, for their part, with being too ready to deny or disre- gard realist nature. A conception of nature as the permanent ground</page><page sequence="6">60 Kate Soper of environmental action is indispensable, I argue, to the coherence of constructivist ecological discourse about the "culturally" or the "changing face of nature" conceived as surface environment, reliant as this is on a distinction between the causal powers operant at a deep level and the historicity of their consequence, whether these are natu- rally precipitated (the earthquake, volcanic eruption) or humanly engineered (the ancient barrow or nuclear bunker). But it is also essential to any discourse about the culturally constructed body and its mutable gender significations, since the very emphasis on the vari- able and culturally relative quality of human sexuality requires as its counterpart recognition of the more constant and universal features of embodied existence if it is to be meaningful. We must recognise a nat- ural body in this sense if we are to speak of any medical intervention in it, any controlling use of surgery or dieting or body building to alter bodily shape and appearance in accordance with (or defiance of) social norms of beauty and gender identity. However, it is also an implication of my position that I am highly critical of that form of realism which presents "nature" as an inde- pendent domain of intrinsic value which has been necessarily and progressively depreciated as a consequence of the intrusive and cor- rupting activities of the human species. Such an approach obscures the fact that much of the "nature" which we are called upon to pre- serve or conserve (most obviously the so-called "natural" landscape, including much thought of as "wilderness") takes the physical form it does only in virtue of centuries of human activity, and is, in an impor- tant sense, a "cultural construct". It also abstracts from the exploita- tive social relations which have gone into the making of the environment and are inscribed in its physical territory: in Britain, for example, in its grouse moors and enclosures, its feudal hamlets and country estates. It overlooks, too, the extent to which our conceptions of the aesthetic attractions and value of the natural world have them- selves been shaped in the course of our interaction with it, and have therefore to be viewed as, at least in part, reactive responses to its effects. Nature itself only begins to figure as a positive and redemp- tive power, and to be valued in its sublime and untamed aspects at the point where human mastery over its forces is extensive enough for aesthetic exaltation in wilderness to replace blind animal terror. The romanticisation of nature is in this sense a manifestation of the same human powers over nature whose destructive effects it laments.9 If, indeed, we are to give proper due both to the actual making of the environment, and to the contemporary tailoring of "nature" to modern</page><page sequence="7">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 61 needs and perceptions, we must inevitably recognise the conceptual difficulty of simply counterposing nature and culture as if they were two clearly distinguishable and exclusive domains. Much which greens loosely refer to as "natural" is indeed a product of culture, both in a physical sense and in the sense that perceptions of its beauties and value are culturally shaped. But there are also, of course, very serious ethical and political objections to conceptualising nature as an autonomous locus of intrinsic value which we should always seek to preserve from human defilement and instrumental appropriation. The ecocentric polemic against "anthropocentric" prioritisation of human interests all too readily lends itself to a reactionary anti-human-speciesism. To depict all human beings as equal enemies of nature is to abstract from the huge differences between the richer and poorer nations in their con- sumption of global resources, and their levels of responsibility for ecological abuse; it can also condone policies of nature conservation whose effect is further to reduce the livelihood of those more impov- erished and exploited sectors of humanity which are least to blame for ecological depletion and pollution. It is precisely because a regard for the "immediate interests" of nature (where this is conceived in terms of protection of non-human species, wilderness, etc.) may be consistent with the most patriarchal and least democratic political institutions, and the implementation of totalitarian methods of con- trolling human consumption, population and migration that a green politics which professes a concern for global equity, gender parity and the collective well-being of future generations, must eschew a simplistic theory of natural value. The attempt to accommodate eco- logical scarcities can be made in a variety of ways (capitalist, social- ist, authoritarian, fascistic . . .) all of them in contestation over what it means for human beings to flourish (which means also over the issue whether some more than others should be allowed to do so both now and in the future). In fact, what is important about the emergence of the green movement is not that it supplies us with a definite political agenda but that, as Bruno Latour has put it, "it suspends our certain- ties with regard to the sovereign good of human and non-human beings, of ends and means".10 It makes us think again about what "living in harmony" with nature or in a viable global order might entail, about how it bears on current conceptions of the "good life", and about what we are ready - or not so ready - to do as a means to its achievement.</page><page sequence="8">62 Kate Soper in One could reformulate these points in terms of the necessity of recog- nising that "nature", when conceived in the only form in which it can be said to be fully independent and non-artefactual, is nature in my realist sense of causal power and process, and cannot in itself supply an ecological politics. Nature in this conception is, as Ted Benton has pointed out, essentially theoretical-explanatory and has very little normative import.11 It may "recommend" certain types of action, and it will always "have its say" in determining the consequences of what we do, but it does not enforce a politics. Nature in this realist sense sets some limits and constraints on what we can do, or try to do, but these will be very elastic. To recognise the independent reality of nature as deep structure and process is at the same time to accept how few normative implications for human environmental action follow from that recognition. It is also to recognise that we cannot derive an eco-politics from looking, as deep ecology realists invite us to, to the "intrinsic values" or "needs" of nature. Indeed, I want to argue that our current ecological situation is to be illuminated primarily not by reference to the nature of non-human nature nor by recalling us to our affinities with other living creatures, but by consideration of the fraught nature of our own - distinctively human - condition as beings who are both on a continuum with and, in an importance sense, disconnected from the rest of animality: both members, like other animals, of a biological species and dependent on environmental resources for the supply of all our material needs, but at the same time unlike them in the urge we have to engage in a more than immanent and reproductive existence - to fulfil ourselves through dynamic and constantly innovative forms of cultural transcendence. But it is at this point that my position begins to diverge from that of Benton and many other green thinkers. For it is often implied by ecologists - and the position is explicitly defended by Benton12 - that a "naturalism" or "monism" which views the distinction between humans and other animals as a matter of degree rather than of kind, is alone compatible with the adoption of eco-friendly policies. Thus it is argued that whereas the "humanist" emphasis on human difference licences an instrumental and destructive use of nature as mere means to human ends, the emphasis on human communality and continuity with other species encourages a more proper respect and preservative instinct.13 I myself, however, do not believe that responsible green decisions require us to recognise and affirm our affinities with other</page><page sequence="9">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 63 living creatures rather than to insist "anthropocentrically" on our dis- tinction from them. There is no space here to expand at any length on my objections to Benton's form of naturalism, but they relate essentially to two claims he makes - firstly, that the needs which are held in common with other animals are best analysed as being specifically human ways of doing what other animals also do; and secondly that even where the needs seem entirely particular to human beings (what he terms "self- realisation" needs), they are best viewed as derived from attributes or requirements common to both humans and non-humans. Our human cognitive, aesthetic and normative capacities and needs are thus to be regarded, as Benton puts it, as "in some sense consequential upon those needs which are common to natural beings, or upon the species- specific ways in which those common needs are met".14 Against these claims, I want to argue that the putative distinction between two types of need is inherently problematic, and that the specific modes in which human beings gratify the needs (e.g. for nourishment, sex, etc.) they share with other creatures cannot be understood without invok- ing precisely those more spiritual needs of "self-realisation" which are said to be "in some sense" emergent or derivable from them. In other words, what distinguishes the specifically human mode of grat- ification of needs held in common with other creatures is the aesthetic and symbolic dimension itself, and one must question whether a non- reductive naturalism of the kind defended by Benton can fully respect this differentiation without falling into circularity. A further - clearly related - difficulty is that Benton's claim that "spiritual" capacities are to be viewed as "in some sense" consequen- tial upon other commonly shared "animal" needs is altogether too evasive. For unless we are told more precisely in what sense this is, it is impossible to determine whether the position held is indeed non- reductive. It seems, as Tim Haywood has suggested, that what Benton has in mind is a view of distinctively human needs as emergent prop- erties of needs shared with other animals: as "complex needs which retain elements of more basic simple needs, but also incorporate a fur- ther 'higher' element such that the whole need is something more than the sum of its parts - an emergent need which is neither reducible to the simple basic need nor autonomous of it".15 But as Hayward points out, this in effect confounds needs with "emergent powers" or capacities, which is not at all what Benton wants, since his whole point is that human beings have developed many "powers" (e.g. to build nuclear arsenals) that go against their needs.</page><page sequence="10">64 Kate Soper In order to preserve his naturalism from the reductionism of view- ing all human ways of doing things, including the most ecologically destructive, as "in some sense" natural, Benton has to invoke, if only implicitly, a prior evaluation that distinguishes between the more or less "naturally needed" quality of these modes of comportment - and the effect of this is to render those which are not needed, or "falsely" needed, unamenable to explanation in terms of his naturalist theory. I would therefore agree here with Hayward that a naturalistic account of how powers develop new needs cannot tell us which of these are really needed. Decisions about how we should comport ourselves, whether in our relations to each other or to nature, necessarily involve evaluation of the priority to be accorded to differing needs, capacities and forms in which human beings have pursued "self-realisation", and cannot be derived directly from some wholly objective knowledge we could in principle attain "from nature" (i.e. from what we ultimately have in common with other animals) about the "truth" of our needs. My humanist insistence on the specificity of human ways of doing things (and its corresponding resistance to basing ecological policy on our affinities with other animals) also leads me to reject post-struc- turalist invitations, such as Haraway extends, to blur the conceptual distinctions not only between the machinic and human but also between the human and the animal. "Nothing", she argues, "convinc- ingly settles the separation of human and animal"; "many feminists affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living beings"; "movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness, but clearsighted recognition of this connectedness".16 Yet just as the refusal to blur the machine-body boundary is, for example, of critical conceptual importance to the condemnation of torture, so one may argue is the refusal to blur the human-animal divide to the respect which Haraway and other postmodernists clearly want us to accord to the distinctive pleasures and pains of human love and sexu- ality. Indeed, it is ultimately quite difficult to read Haraway without sensing a persistent equivocation on these issues, since even as we are asked to collapse our conceptual discriminations between the human, the animal and the machinic, she is also arguing morally in ways that presuppose their continued observation.17 Take, for example, the questions she poses in her latest book about our human responses to such transgenic creations as OncoMouse. A trade-marked biotic entity, genetically designed for the study and prevention of breast can- cer, OncoMouse is, as Haraway puts it, a reconfiguring of "biological knowledge, laboratory practise, property law, economic fortunes and</page><page sequence="11">Realism , Humanism and the Politics of Nature 65 collective and personal hopes and fears" - and as such poses deep and difficult questions of kinship: how are natural kinds to be identified in the late twentieth realm of aliens and transpecifics? What kinds of crosses and offspring count as legitimate and illegitimate, to whom and at what cost? "Who", asks Haraway, "are my familiars, my sib- lings, and what kind of liveable world are we trying to build?"18 Now, these are indeed burning issues, but that we see them as such, and agonise about the moral dilemmas they pose, is precisely because we still observe our organic-inorganic, human-animal conceptual divi- sions. The irony of Haraway's invitation to blur them is that if were truly to do so we would no longer recognise the force of the moral problems she poses for us. A world bereft of these distinctions is a world bereft of the grounding conditions for the moral, political and scientific critique. And of that, indeed, we may ask whether it is truly a "liveable" world. IV But there is a further reason not to assimilate human modes of being too closely to those of non-human animals which has direct bearing on the question of political practice - and this is that a naturalism of that kind seems to encourage too static and fixed a conception of our forms of flourishing. I have recognised that human beings are simi- larly placed to other animals in respect of certain basic needs of sur- vival, and that in this sense we need to work with a universalist and (minimally) essentialist conception of human nature. But, as I also earlier suggested, they are very unlike other biological species in respect of their capacity consciously to monitor their impact on the environment and to rethink forms of production and consumption in the light of ecological constraints. This malleability or underdetermi- nation in respect of human pleasure and fulfilment needs to be emphasised as a potential asset of ecological adjustment. For us, unlike other creatures, living in ways which place less stress on nature involves re-thinking our conditions of flourishing and forms of tran- scendence: it means uncoupling the dynamic of human pleasures and modes of self-fulfilment from its current reliance - at least in the affluent nations - on intense global exploitation, both social and envi- ronmental. How do we reconcile the ecological - and egalitarian - need for a more cyclical and reproductive (if you like, speaking loosely, more "natural" or "immanent" ) use of resources with the</page><page sequence="12">66 Kate Soper more distinctively human - and individualist - needs for continuous cultural innovation, enhanced gratification and self-expression? Can we find ways of living rich, fulfilling, complex, non-repetitive lives without social injustice and without too much damage to "nature"? The problem here is not how better to "respect" or get "back to nature" (in the sense of reverting to tradition, simplicity and imma- nence) but how to advance to a more assertively human and ecologi- cally benign form of future (that is, how to proceed beyond the limiting and ecologically unsustainable forms of transcendence cur- rently furnished by modernity). Admittedly, achieving the latter may well involve "changing our attitudes" to "nature" in the sense of becoming more sensitive to the needs and conditions of existence of other biotic entities or develop- ing an enhanced sense of our own instrumental and aesthetic position within it. But we should not assume that respect for the worth or being of non-human nature automatically generates good ecological practice. One suspects that there are many capitalist entrepreneurs and industrialists with a deeper respect for their dogs and horses than for their human employees, let alone for the needs of future genera- tions. Nor do I think we should assume - as Andrew Collier appears to in his recent work on Being and Worth - that greater knowledge of animal ethology or of the physical, chemical or biological nature of nature always leads to a better appreciation of its worth.19 In fact I rather think Collier may overstate the role of cognitive knowledge in arriving at the appreciation that we do have of non-human nature. The knowledge we gain of other creatures does influence our feel- ings about them, but the feelings we intuitively have for them also inform our theories about them, or prompt distrust of those that are offered (as Bolingbroke remarked apropos Descartes' learned hypotheses about the machine-like nature of animals: "The plain man would persist in thinking there was a difference between the town bull and the parish clock").20 Moreover, if having worth is con- strued in Collier's argument as entailing some obligation to preserve, then the claim would seem mistaken. Very often, as in the case of life-forms causing disease, more knowledge simply leads to more efficient elimination. Pace Collier's Augustinián line on being, being is not unproblematically "good" where it is the being that leads to diarrhoea, blindness, leukemia. All too often, it seems to me, those calling for more respectful atti- tudes to the value of nature forget how nasty nature in some forms can be to us, as well as how offensive some nature-lovers can be to other</page><page sequence="13">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 67 human beings. In any case, my sense is that if anything effective is to be done in the way of improving our treatment of animals, and cor- recting social and environmental exploitations, then the emphasis must fall on transforming human consumption rather than on devel- oping a new reverence for "nature". From this perspective, any form of naturalism, such as that defended by Benton, that appears to presuppose that our needs and forms of flourishing are naturally fixed and objectively knowable in much the way they are for other creatures, is problematic. For it would seem to imply that ecological harmony could be achieved or restored only by discriminating, on the basis of this knowledge, between true and false needs, and pursuing the former while discarding the latter. But unless true needs are simply being analytically defined in terms of those that prove ecologically viable, there is no more reason to suppose that only those deemed to be "true" needs will be endlessly accommodated by the provisioning of "nature", than there is to view all current "needs" or forms of flourishing that are ecologically destructive or unsustainable as inherently "false". Any globally responsible adjustment to ecological scarcities will require those liv- ing in affluent societies both to restrict, or altogether sacrifice, some current sources of gratification, and to be imaginative and undog- matic in their attitudes to what they can enjoy: to open themselves to the possibilities of an alternative hedonism and to modes of living and self-fulfilment rather different from those associated with prevalent Western assumptions about flourishing. But adjustment of this kind should be viewed not so much as the eradication of "false" needs but as the exploration of new pleasures. John O'Neill has suggested that in pressing this case, I am being overly determinisi in my conception of what counts as a naturalist position on flourishing. A naturalist position, he points out, is consis- tent with allowing that particular needs (he cites the example of our need for relations with others) can be met in a wide variety of differ- ing ways. But I think he is missing the point here, since the question I am raising through the concept of flourishing is precisely about how we should go about the satisfaction of such abstract needs under cur- rent ecological conditions. Take the example of transport needs. Few will dispute that human beings have a need for mobility - to move about from one place to another. But how fast and in what mode? Contemporary conceptions of flourishing in affluent cultures view this, for example, as condi- tional upon at least the motor car, and increasingly upon the access to</page><page sequence="14">68 Kate Soper airflight, too. In other words, we think of ourselves as flourishing in respect of our need for mobility and communication very much in terms of the availability of modes of transport of a speed and flexi- bility unknown to previous generations. Indeed, this is so much so that most people speak of their "need" for their car, and many others of their need to fly. But if these are indeed needs, or at any rate forms of consumption essential to flourishing, they are also needs/forms of flourishing that are highly problematic ecologically and upon which nature may well not prove able to deliver even for another century let alone indefinitely. In this sense, even as we are satisfying our abstract need for relations with others, for mobility, for shelter, for nourish- ment, and so on, with a particular set of satisfiers so essential to cur- rent well-being that they appear themselves as needed items of consumption, we have also - for ecological reasons - to be pondering on possible alternatives to these satisfiers. Despite O'Neill's claim to the contrary, naturalism is too thin and non-committal if - as in his argument, and I think in Benton's too - it is happy simply to point to its own indeterminacy. Naturalism of this kind may preempt the charge of being deterministic by refusing to specify which satisfiers are actually naturally "needed" and simply claiming instead that it is theoretically compatible with a wide variety of modes of consump- tion. But if it does so, it cannot at the same time claim any privileged status over humanism as the theoretical grounding for a socially just and non-exploitative ecological politics. NOTES 1 .

I would also include within the constructivist camp the neo-anti -romanticism of Donna Haraway's cyborg feminism and those who would have us view cybernetics as signalling the final collapse of any mean- ingful natural-artificial distinction. For some further examples of the anti-realist position, and some helpful discussion on this, see John O'Neill, "Nature, Cul- ture, Politics," in Wolfgang Reidei (ed.), Narratives of Nature, Essen: Verlag die Blaue Eule, 1999, pp.35-38. 3 . For some recent examples of both these perspectives, see the collection of essays in Richard Kerridge and Neil Sammells, Writing the Environment, London &amp; New York, Zed Books, 1998. Heidegger is an important influence on the former line of ecocriticism, and quite frequently invoked by critics of the more nature- endorsing disposition. 4. Donna Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs and Women, London &amp; New York, Free Asso- ciation &amp; Routledge, 1991, p. 10. 5. In her influential argument for a "cyborg feminism", Haraway invites us to revel in the end of nature, or at any rate in the end of the idea of nature as promise of ultimate unification or redemption ("The cyborg", she writes, "is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness . . . The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense", Simians, Cyborgs and Women, pp. 150-1); and it is only, she argues, by refusing to root a feminist politics in bodily integrity, that we avoid essentialist positions on female being, and do justice to what she calls the "partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment" (p. 151), thereby avoiding the heterosex- ual and maternal "norms"(p.l80). (It is in this spirit that she applauds the FemaleMen, cyborg monsters, mutants and experiments in "technological pollu- tion" of the personal and political that "people" cyberpunk writings and feminist science-fiction; cf. pp. 173- 181.) But this seems based on a quite unjustified assumption that there is no alternative between a total (and often wholly fantas- tic) flight from "nature" and accepting patriarchal constructions of the female body and sexuality. In reality, it is only in the appeal to the bodily integrity, anguish and suffering of the oppressed subject that one can ultimately ground the demand for release from distorting or confining identities, or call for improved cultural understandings of what it is to be cast as subordinate. Indeed, it is diffi- cult to know what sense to make of appeals to the "fluid and partial" nature of female sexuality if we are not to construe them as an assertion of the need to release a flow of natural desires from the dams of cultural constraints. This appeal is itself an appeal to respect bodily integrity. What is more, despite Har- away's claim that the cyborg is resistant to any identification with nature, cyborgs</page><page sequence="16">70 Kate Soper are still approved for having what is called a "natural feel" for a united front pol- itics, and cyborg "sex" is still recommended to us in terms of a naturalistic vocabulary of "intimacy"and bodily couplings (p. 151). 6.

I do not intend to suggest here that the eighteenth century theorists of the "nat- ural sublime" were themselves conscious of these underlying conditions of their aesthetic interest in the remote, wild and terrifying aspects of nature. For the "master" theorist, Kant, an appreciation of the sublime is potentially available to us all, and its pleasure to be analysed in terms of the way it recalls us to a sense of the superiority of the powers of human reason over anything encountered phe- nomenally. My point is that the emergence of the vogue for the sublime comes in the wake of a progressive domestication of the environment. In the United States, the Hudson River School draws on sublime imagery in the early nine- teenth century, but remains a minority taste, opposed to the dominant Concor- dian sympathies.

These are claims which require far more qualification and skeptical appraisal than Haraway anywhere accords them - a neglect which is all the stranger given her clear understanding of the risks of sociobiological reductionism. One might note, too, that it is difficult to see how this part of her argument avoids the Romantic-redemptive framework of thinking about nature which she professes to want to avoid. The standard move of the ani- mal liberationists is to oppose the body to the machine, the organic and suffer- ing flesh to the indifference and alienation of bio-technology and agribusiness. Where, then, does this leave a cyborg politics? And how can this approval for the natural connectedness of all animal species be reconciled with the anti-natural- ism of her (wildly indiscriminate) attack on the "racism" of those who appeal to the idea of a "natural" species in their objections to genetic engineering (cf. Modest_Witnessf pp.60-62)? 17. In this sense one of her critics, Jill Marsden, ("Virtual Sexes and Feminist Futures: the Philosophy of Cyberfeminism", Radical Philosophy , no. 78, July-</page><page sequence="17">Realism, Humanism and the Politics of Nature 71 August 1996, pp.8- 15) is quite right to complain about the confusion in Har- away's demand for responsibility: "In insisting", Marsden writes, "on 'political accountability' and ethical obligation, Haraway struggles to rescue 'A Cyborg Manifesto' from the charge of technological determinism, but in so doing weak- ens the case for understanding technological revolution and biological evolution as symbiotic" (p. 14). But while for Marsden, all this represents a capitulation to the slave morality which cyberfeminism otherwise "so refreshingly ignores", a refusal to face the full trauma of dismantling the biological order, and a cowardly reversion to humanist values, it figures for me as reluctant and confused testi- mony to Haraway 's understanding of the self-defeating quality of cybernetic anti-humanism. 18.
