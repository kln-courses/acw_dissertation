<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRINTS OF LOUISE BOURGEOIS: SOME COMMENTS by Louise Bourgeois &amp; Deborah Wye Louise Bourgeois deäded in 1990 to give her com plete printed oeuvre to the Museum of Modern Art. She has created more than 150 images since herfirst print in 1938. Many passed through a sequence of states and variant proofs, so her gift included some 600 sheets. As famous as Bourgeois is, much of this work was unknown. The Museum of Modem Art cel ebrates her amazing generosity with The Prints of Louise Bourgeois, an exhibition of 150 prints curated by Deborah Wye, and by publishing a cata logue raisonné. In preparing this catalogue, Bourgeois has been as generous with her time as her art. She has not only helped Wye and Carol Smith document the works, establishing printing sequence and details, she has shared her motivations and thoughts in creating images. In this she herself was helped by her pleasure in keeping notes and daybooks through the years, indeed, in keeping everything. She is apparently an unsurpassed packrat. Extending the goodwill, the Museum of Modern Art has allowed PCN to preview a few of these "dramas of the self from the catalogue. Bourgeois ' comments are direct quotations from entries. Deborah Wye has written additional notes for PCN, pladng each print in perspective. For the full narrative, consult more of the artist's recollections and Wye's engaging and thoughtful essay in The Prints of Louise Bourgeois. And see the exhibition, at MOMA from September 13, 1994, to January 3, 1995, prior to an extensive tour. Many thanks to all.

In fact, she had complains." She discusses the state of being worked regularly in the printmaking medium "ridden with fears...some healthy and some from 1938 through 1949, completing 65 com neurotic.

Her relationship with her father was particularly troubling and has been a potent source for her imagery. Working out such unfinished emotional business through her art links her with the psychoanalytically inspired Surrealists and their focus on the unconscious. _____ LB Bourgeois refers to the early states of this print as depicting "mollusks...clams...and ger W&amp;S 31.3 Louise Bourgeois, Plate 3hom He Dis- fîfjp, •itftfT' i|f mination."

She believes that one must "pacify these fairies so the child will be pro tected. It is the fairies who will take care of the baby, not the mother. They are a substitute for the mother." She goes on to say: "If there is no good mother, there is no bad mother. You can destroy your mother." For the mother, this vul nerability serves "to push you and make you ner vous.
