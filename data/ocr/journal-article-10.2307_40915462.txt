<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DRAMA OF NORSE MYTHOLOGY1 By Norse Mythology is ordinarily understood the stories about supernatural beings told in prose and poetry in Old Norse literature. Old Norse literature contains also many other kinds of writings: poetry on historical subjects, sagas, laws, homilies, learned treatises on astronomy, poetry, phonetics, etc., handed down in MSS found now mostly in the state libraries, and other libraries of the Scandinavian North. We are here con- cerned only with the writings that deal with myths. The name Norse Mythology also denotes the scientific study of the myths and their interpretation. As a study it is a science, because the method of it is based on a well-established tech- nique. As a department of study Norse Mythology is related, more or less intimately, to several other fields: Philology, Arch- aeology, Pre-History, Comparative Religion, and the begin- nings of the study of Natural Science. The stories of Norse Mythology were not told primarily for the purpose of entertainment; perhaps none of them had that purpose. In a later age, when the old belief was beginning to decline, the stories were no doubt so used among those who had become unbelievers. In the modern age they are, except among students of mythology and folklore, read mostly for entertain- ment, and extensively so read, for they are masterpieces of the narrative art. Butwhen the myths were formed the purpose was a wholly different one. The deities and the heroes that walked on the stage before the men and women of those times were to them not the creatures of a poet's imagination, but real living gods and rulers. The myths had a religious purpose, and often formed a part of religious ceremonies. Certain poems, as Skir- nir's Wooing (Skírnismál), were ritualistic dramas. The per- formers were not entertainers; they were participants in a ritual. But there is also a fourth way in which the myths have sig- nificance. They are originally explanatory narratives. They are early man's effort to explain nature. To early man everything 1 A lecture read on the evening of May 7, 1937, at the twenty-sixth annual meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study, Lincoln, Neb. 135</page><page sequence="2">136 in his environment, and the phenomena he observed in the heavens, aroused wonder; and he was curious to know how it was that these things performed that way. He wished to know the causes of things; some tried to explain the origin of things. The earliest primitive did not get very far with these problems, not even with inventing interesting stories about them. But in a somewhat later period of the ascent of man from his primitive state he began to formulate accounts, that have in them some- thing of reasoned explanation. Still later, i.e., when he had reached a relatively high state of civilization, as compared with the earliest primitives, let us say as with Indo-Europeans in the period from ca. 1000 b.c. to 1000 A.D., we find an early natural science taking form. And from time to time this was added to by the thinkers among the myth-makers of the time. And these efforts to explain were always intimately connected with the religion of the time and the region. The thunder is a force in nature, later personified as a divine power. In the thun- der-storm the God of Thunder rides in his loud-rumbling wagon through the storm-clouds. But why is he doing this? Then the effort to explain it begins. And the explanation that finds favor survives, and is handed down to later generations. And of course the explanation is always a story. For early man always visualizes that which he tries to explain. And this method of narrative explanation continues down through the ages, taking on varying features in different regions; for the explanation is colored and shaped by climate, and the stage of civilization of the people. It is a fact of no little interest that so many fundamental elements in early explanatory myths have parallels of one or more features in the different areas of the Indo-European world. As a form of early science we are surprised often by the conclu- sions that mythological thinking came to. And from the scien- tists of today, who have examined these mythological theories about the world, we learn that sometimes they correspond closely to the conclusions of science to-day. (And, to bring mythology into line with present-day inventions also, it may be noted that the god Frey in Norse Mythology had an air-ship.)</page><page sequence="3">137 It will be in order here to say a few words about the sources of our knowledge of these myths. The principal source is the Royal Codex 2365 in Copenhagen. It is a somewhat weathered and water-damaged MS in small folio, which contains 36 poems written with insular (Anglo- Saxon) script in Old Icelandic. This MS had been lost for some five centuries when in 1643 Brynjulfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skálholt, Iceland, rediscovered it; and his find soon became known to the Northern literary world, and far beyond. Bishop Sveinsson took good care of it in his home, until the great Ice- landic collector of old MSS Arne Magnusson, coming on a mis- sion from the Danish government, arrived in Iceland in the summer of 1662 in search of documents that might throw light upon the ancient history and culture of the North. In Iceland especially it was thought that such might be found. Bishop Sveinsson showed Arne the old codex that he had found; and he asked him to take it back with him to Copenhagen as a gift to the king. And when some months later Arne returned, with a rich harvest of MSS, he carried with him also that greatest treasure of them all, the Edda manuscript. In Copenhagen it was later embodied in the vast manuscript collections of the Royal Library, where it has since been pre- served. Thus it happens that we are indebted to this cultured and literature-loving Icelandic bishop of the Church for now possessing the famous codex of poems about pagan deities; this rare volume, which became also a veritable store-house of information about the life, the belief, and the culture of the North in pre-Christian times. There are a number of poems of like content and form in other codices, which supplement in important ways the corpus of lays in the chief codex. Next is to be mentioned the so-called Prose Edda, written about 1225 by Snorri Sturlason, which relates in Snorri's usual excellent style the same myths, and other myths. In telling these, in order apparently to emphasize the reliability of his account, Snorri frequently quotes from some of the principal lays of the Skálholt codex. But he also quotes from poems that have not come down to us, which seems to indicate that his</page><page sequence="4">138 source was a different codex from the Regius 2365. But it is quite possible, that he had no collection of poems before him at all when he wrote; in other words, that he wrote everything from memory. The second part of Snorri's book is in the nature of a book of instruction for aspiring poets. And in this equally extensive work his examples of figures of speech and approved poetic devices are taken almost exclusively from the poetry of the skalds,2 or court poets. And the content of the quoted stanzas is often parts of myths. As we see, the poetry of the skalds becomes a third native source. The skalds were court poets, they were highly honored and well-paid attachés at the court of Norway, where the insti- tution started. Later, from ca. 975 on, they were almost always Icelanders, and they now visited and recited their poems also at the courts of Sweden, Denmark, and England. Poems, or fragments of poems, of 209 named skalds have come down to us. If these 41 were Norwegians, living in the period 800-1000; 168 were Icelanders living in the period 900-ca. 1200. There are many anonymous poems from both periods. Finally there is a large body of sagas, Icelandic Family Sagas, Shorter Episodic Sagas, and the Sagas of the Kings of Norway. So far as religious belief is concerned the sagas are of equal im- portance with the Eddas; but for the mythology they are of secondary importance. Finally there is from Denmark the Latin- written Historia Danorum by the Dane Saxo Grammaticus, the first nine books of which give the mythical history of the North. It is convenient to distinguish between Lower Mythology and Higher Mythology. Lower Mythology, as the name implies, includes the beliefs and naive narratives found on the lower levels of culture, especially among primitive peoples today. Lower Mythology includes also, however, survivals of it among our culture peoples in the period of myth-making, i.e., in the Pre-Christian age. While not identical with Minor Nature Worship, it is essentially the same, as it deals with the beliefs and stories of peoples in early stages of mental development. As 2 ON. skáldr.</page><page sequence="5">139 worship it has to do with rocks and stones, trees and groves, rivers, springs, and sacred wells, vegetation in general, and the lower animals. In so far as there are explanatory myths, they are merely naive tales about something in nature, and fables about animals. I should say that the so-called myths of even our noble Amerindians (American Indians) nearly all belong to this category. It would be some four thousand years ago that the mythological thinking of our Indo-European ancestors was at this stage. But the farther back we go the more survivals we find. And even today, in every country of Europe, and here in America among transplanted Europeans, there are numerous survivals in superstitions, and in popular practices of one kind or another. Higher Mythology is the name we give to the narratives and explanatory myths connected mainly with Major Na- ture Worship; in this the major phenomena of nature play a central role. One will here also meet with the minor objects of nature as elements in the often quite complex myths of Higher Mythology. But that which engaged the mind of man in this stage, and in this type of early literature, was such problems as the relationship between, and the origin of, such forces or aspects of nature as earth and heaven, the sun, the moon, and the stars; thunder, lightning, and storm; the clouds, the moun- tains, and the ocean; dawn and twilight, night and day; light arid darkness; the northern lights, the rainbow; the offices and the paths of the heavenly bodies; the regular succession of win- ter and summer; the seasons and the reckoning of time; the origin of these things; and the origin of man. And with the most advanced peoples these speculations and these searchings for causes result in conclusions and explanations which become the basis on which modern natural science first began to build. Especially characteristic of Higher Mythology is the personi- fication of the forces and the phenomena of nature. In fact personification would seem to be a necessary condition for the rise of myths. Originally it was the phenomena themselves that were invoked. But myths do not seem to exist in this stage of belief. And we can easily see why. A myth is a narrative or a bit of drama; a narrative presupposes friendly or hostile dealings</page><page sequence="6">140 between individual beings or groups of beings. The means of conveying this are the words and the movements of the actors. Or it may be that some narrator describes all this; but invari- ably the narrator's words show that he is thinking of the powers as persons. I am thinking just now of the example in the Old Norse Konungs Skuggsjd (The King's Mirror), a book of in- structions for a prince, where an unusually fine and dramatically effective description of a battle of the winds occurs. But the author speaks of the 'Silvery brow' and the 'friendly face' of the East Wind in the morning; and the aspect of the winds when 'pleased' or when 'angry' is described in terms which show that the narrator thinks of them as anthropomorphic deities. And our modern poets do this in verse and prose today of course. Here occurs to me a passage in that incomparable travel-nar- rative A Vagabond in the Caucasus by Stephen Graham. It is a stormy night in the Caucasus; the author, as usual, is sleeping in the open, this time under a bridge sheltered against the storm. For the clouds are black and the winds are angry this night. And he paints in words the grand drama he sees on the heavens, as the opposing forces rush along there on their galloping steeds. In the mythology the forces in nature may be individualized often as zoömorphic beings; originally it was so for the most part. There are, indeed, here and there reminders in Norse Mythology of an earlier zoömorphic stage of some of them, as in other high mythologies, Greek, for example. But in Norse Mythology these are merely in the nature of survivals. The gods have the same shape as we humans; and of course they have, for did not the gods create the first man and woman in their own likeness? Or, putting it the other way around, are not the gods idealized humans? Yes, the gods are like man. But the gods are vastly more powerful, more skilful, infinitely wiser. They are what man would like to be; what he aspires to be, as long as he believes in them. The quality that is most prominently associated with the gods in Norse Mythology is the being capable, knowing so well how to do things in their various spheres. All the gods and the goddesses are supreme and unsurpassed in this respect in their several offices. It is a worship of skill we might say, looking at Norse Mythology from this point of view.</page><page sequence="7">141 The god is a power; but this too is conceived of differently, and developed differently according to the stage of civilization of the people. Among the lowest peoples it is especially physical power that is associated with the gods. The god, or especially the chief god, is so big and strong that he amuses himself by pushing mountains around. But in the mythologies of culture- peoples that is not the occupation of the gods. But, nota bene, since the gods are idealizations of earthly conditions, and of the qualities that characterize man, physical strength may be rep- resented in the myths; but physical strength does not occupy a high place among divine qualities. It is left almost wholly to the god Thor alone, this battling with giants. And Thor is regarded as somewhat less of an intellectual than the other gods. But also Thor employs purely intellectual weapons some- times, as when he outwitted Allwise the dwarf. But even Thor, whose strength all the giants fear, never uses just bodily strength. It is the skill with which he wields his weapon, coupled with his strength, that always gives him victory. And we do not forget that he made for himself those iron-gloves and that marvellous strength-girdle. No, with the gods the quality that power takes is on a higher level. The giants stand for things physical; they are powers too, but merely in the physical sphere; for that very reason they are not gods. In Norse Mythology the idea of power in the gods is wholly intellectual. Each god is not only superhuman, but also supreme in his sphere among the gods. Ôdin, the highest of the gods, is preeminently the intellectual; Frigg, his wife, is his feminine counterpart. T$r, the original heaven-god, has been largely replaced in his offices by Odin, but he remains as the god of courage; and he appears also as the guardian of the popular assembly, and the protector of law and government. Baldr, the god of the shining countenance, he, who knows not falsehood, is gentle and of beautiful speech. But especially he is a god of such qualities of mind and spirit that all the world loves him, and the whole world was in tears when he died. Heimdal, the god of dawn, is also the first father of the several social classes, the divine teacher of each, and the originator of kingship. The goddess Saga has the power of seeing into the distant future, and she gives counsels to Odin. Njçrdr is god of commerce and</page><page sequence="8">142 seafaring. Bragi is the god of eloquence. Forseti is the god of justice, whose court is the best seat of judgment among gods and men. Freya is the goddess of love. Frey is the god of fer- tility and abundance. Vali is the sure marksman. And Vllr is so swift on snowshoes that no contender can be found against his skill. And there are many others. In the course of the centuries Odin, the highest of the gods, and originally the god of the wind, usurps somewhat these offices, especially those that have to do with new knowledge, new skills, and advancing culture, in short with the more purely intel- lectual activities, and he drives out Tyr almost completely. And that fact, interpreted, means: Tyr was very conservative, too conservative, and the times left him behind. He wished to cling always to the old, old ways of doing things, old weapons in war, for example. Odin too was conservative; but he, as the god of wisdom, practiced a wise conservatism, and stood ready to accept the new that proved its worth. And when a war-like age came, the two gods were put to the proof. The old weapon was the dagger; and Tyr was the dagger god. But a new and better weapon was coming into use, namely the long-sword, which weapon Odin promptly adopted. With the dagger, now, his people would have gone down to defeat; with the long-sword they were able to maintain themselves and be victorious. And Tyr's decline as a god had begun. Now Odin rose to the highest place. And from being god of the wind, god of death, and god of the artistocracy, Odin be- came also the god of magic and the healing art, the god of runes and writing; the god of poetry and eloquence; and the god of all intellectual endeavor. In the Hâvamâl he is the teacher of hu- manity. The successive steps in the cultural advance of the race is reflected in the history of the development of Odin. Thus Odin becomes the divine Bringer of culture. In Norse Mythology there is no conflict between some good and other evil gods; the conflict is shifted here to one between a god and a giant, or between the gods and the giants. The gods are man's protectors; no one could have conceived of their doing anything harmful to, or hostile to, man. In the beginning of time the gods built a bridge from Heaven to Earth. That bridge the</page><page sequence="9">143 gods often travel when they wish to visit Earth. The gods are the friendly powers, always; Odin from his High-Seat in Âsgard has given them once in the past their code of conduct. This rela- tion of friendship between the gods and man finds its most striking expression in the fond names and intimate epithets applied to the god Thor, as, e.g., when he is called 'The Friend of Man/ or 'My Friend Thor.' But it is evidenced no less sig- nificantly in regard to the more austere Odin, as already sug- gested above. There is, however, the god Loki, who may seem an exception to what I have said. Now in the Prose Edda Loki is character- ized as 'fickle and false'; and from what we know of him, and judging from the things we see him do, he is just a great trouble- maker among the gods of Asgard. But when Loki is cornered, and he sees no way out, he is always able to mend the harm that he has done. As, for example, when he enticed away the goddess I dun, guardian of the Golden Apples of Youth, and the gods be- gan at once to grow old. There was not for a moment any doubt as to who had carried off Idun and her apples. Or when Thor awoke one morning and found his Hammer gone; it was Loki who knew where the hammer was, and who, when forced to it, helped Thor to recover it. Loki, as we see, is clearly a god of deceit and treachery, if we wish to call him a god. But deceit and treachery are the very opposite of the qualities of a god. Of course Loki is no true god; he is not a god originally at all, but a giant. No other conclusion is possible in regard to this riddle of Norse Mythology, about which so many articles and books have been written by mythologists in modern times. In the Lokasenna (The Flyting of Loki), we learn that once long ago a compact of brotherly friendship was made between Odin and Loki by the blood-mingling ritual. And so we can see why it is that Loki resides as a god in Asgard; this handsome and clever demon of trickery got into the good graces of Odin, and was taken up into the household of the Asas, an alliance that had far-reaching and fateful consequences for the Asas. And with this we may leave Loki for the present. How does this attitude to the deities come about in mythol- ogy? It originates in observations; but other factors also enter,</page><page sequence="10">144 as that the major myths came to have a formative influence on the belief. Early man observed that some forces and aspects of nature are helpful, while others seem to act in hostile ways. Just as we today observe that nature behaves in these opposite ways. The Sun is such a helpful power; and the Rainstorm; they give Earth fruitfulness. The Sun furthermore gives us light. The Earth becomes among all Indo-Europeans the mother of every- thing; she was called Terra Mater in Latin, Mother Earth among the English, she is called Jçrd in Old Norse. The purifying Wind is also a beneficent power. These powers, then, which seemed to act thus for man's good, came to be thought of as the good powers, and reverenced as such, and involked for the blessings they could give. On the other hand, there were also destructive forces in na- ture, such as the devastating Frost, which leaves the Earth deso- late and barren; and Winter the monster that destroys life. The Ocean generally becomes a giant. Darkness is most often associ- ated with demons; Light always with gods. Heaven became the first God of Light, or Father Light among Indo-Europeans with the name Diaus-Pitar in Sanskrit, Tin among the Anglo-Saxons, and T$r in the North. (We have the name today in the name of the third day of the week, Tuesday, Norwegian Tyrsdag)? In Norse Mythology there are half a dozen deities that are ema- nations from the original Heaven- God. The gods are the dispensers of all good things; and they come to stand for all that is good. The giants in the same way become the representatives of everything that is harmful and bad. As the foes of the gods the giants are also the foes of man. And thus the conflict in nature and in the supernatural world be- came a conflict between gods and giants. And in the course of time this drama became ethicized; but this would not necessarily happen always, even in mythologies in which the gods are thought of as good, and the giants as bad. For whether the myth becomes ethicized or not, and to what degree it will so become among a particular people, depends on many things, among them, the climate of the region, since the hardships of a severe climate have something to do with shaping 3 Or Tisdag.</page><page sequence="11">145 character. The civilization of the people is another factor; and especially whether a people has begun to think out for them- selves and define the qualities they regard as worthy of praise, and what qualities as not praiseworthy. And perhaps not least does it depend on the level of literary culture to which a people has attained; for the part that the poet-thinker plays in this advance can never be overlooked. The first step toward ethicizing the myth would surely be, that man was beginning to think of good and bad as not just the physically good and bad. Originally the thought in the word was only that; the god was good because he provided man with that which he needed and wished to have. It thus meant just the getting and the having. Compare the Latin word bona, property, which is the same word as the adjective bonus, which means 'good.' And cf. also the German Güter and gut; and Eng- lish goods, which is nothing but the adjective 'good"; and just so in the Scandinavian languages and others. Also the word for 'good' often meant quantity, or size, or strength, or manliness, or a healthy body. There are survivals of these merely physical ideas in the words for 'good' in all the Indo-European languages. The ethicizing of the myth is definitely present in a very fine form already in Old Iranian mythology. It is also present in a similarly highly developed form in Norse Mythology. The remarkable ethical content of the myths of Old Iranian and Old Norse mythology has often been commented on by writers on mythology and comparative religion. I am not here going to try to show what the development was; I dealt with some aspects as recorded in the Hâvamâl in an article published in 1914 in Scandinavian Studies and Notes. It is in some measure a philological and linguistic problem, which must concern itself with the textual criticism of old texts, and also with the analysis of the meanings, and the changing meanings in earlier periods, of the abstract terms which have to do with the morally good and the morally bad. In analyzing briefly the conflict of Norse Mythology it will be proper to consider first the myth about creation and the Golden Age of the world. Only a few facts can be dealt with. They will be the events of Act I of the Drama.</page><page sequence="12">146 Creation myths deal with the origin of the objects and the phenomena of nature and the creation of man. Here creation means the fashioning of the present world-order; the material out of which it was made was there before. Before creation this material was a shapeless chaos. In the Vçluspâ the prophetess, in lines that have been handed down from Indo-European times, describes the appearance of things before creation. She says:4 'Twas the earliest of times when Yinir lived; then was nor sand nor sea nor cooling waves, Earth was not, nor Heaven above. There was the Gap of Ginung, but nowhere grass. Somewhat similar are the lines of the Sanskrit Rig-Veda in the 129th hymn of Book X, where the poet ponders how creation came about. And he speaks of the time when: To be was not, nor not to be, Not the space of the air, not heaven itself, A darkness was it, covered over with darkness; A formless water was the wide world, The world of empty nothingness hidden in Emptiness.1 Sometimes the world is made by some personal being of divine nature, who slays and dismembers another being of giant nature, and then makes the world from his body. In the Old Norse Grîmnismâl, stanza 40, some details are given as follows, in lines which are also very old: From Ymir's flesh the earth was made, but from his blood the sea, rocks from his bones, trees from his hair, but from his skull, heaven. Four additional and later lines occur in the same poem, as follows: Then of his brows the blithe Powers made Midgard for the Sons of Men; 4 In the translations from the Poetic Edda I have, with few exceptions, used the excellent Olive Bray version: The Elder or Poetic Edda. London, 1908. 6 Taken here from my class lecture notes in the course in Norse Mythology (Max Müller 's translation). Swedish translation in Svante Arrhenius: Mannis- kan inför Världsgatan, Stockhohn, 1907, pp. 3-4; German translation of this book: Die Vorstellung vom Weltgebände im Wandel der Zeiten von Svante Ar- rhenius. Leipzig. 1911.</page><page sequence="13">147 But from his brain were the bitter-mooded clouds all fashioned. Everywhere it is water that is the pre-creation element. In part this view arose from observations about water. It was seen that in times of flood the receding waters always leave a deposit; ultimately the view came to be that the Earth had its origin in the accumulated deposits of ages of floods and receding waters. Another observation was no doubt that when a kettle full of water is left boiling until all the water in it has boiled away, there is a dark earth-like deposit left in the kettle. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who lived ca. 550 b.c. also said: "Everything originated in water." Another feature in the myths about origins is darkness. We have then these three: 1, space, vast and abysmal; 2, water; 3, darkness. Further, there was the unorganized matter. These four complete the chaos before creation in the Indo-European mythologies. And also in some non-Indo-European myths; for example, the Chaldean myth begins: "In that time when nothing was of that which is called heaven there was nothing of that which is called earth." Then we are told that Apsu was there, and Tiamat; "these two become the father and mother of every- thing." But Apsu means 'ocean' and Tiamat means 'chaos.' I have quoted in translation, above, some stanzas from the Old Norse myth as given in two poems of the Elder Edda. The myths in these poems are not the theories of two poets about the problem. That these ideas were the general view of the Norse people themselves in Norway and Iceland is shown by the fact that there is hardly one among all the poets of the Elder Edda and other like poetry of mythological content, that does not offer stanzas from the myths. Indeed, the poets always assume, on the part of their audiences, a knowledge of these basic myths, when they are composing and reciting poems about other myths. And in the Prose Edda the myth here considered is told with great fullness, and facts are given that are not recorded in any of the preserved poems, facts which the author substantiates by quoting some versus from other, i.e., lost poems. Further a myth, by its foreshadowing of the great final crisis, is seen to be but a part of the great world-myth, - a link</page><page sequence="14">148 in a chain of events in the supernatural world, with which are inseparably connected the origin and end of the world, and the fate of man. And while the myths as we have them are the liter- ary possession of the Norsemen, i.e., Icelanders and Norwegians, and the poetry exclusively so, the belief and the gods are also those of the Danes and the Swedes; and there is convincing evidence that most of the myths were also current among them as their own myths. We are not dealing with learned theories; it is a popular mythological thinking, given poetic form by the poets of the time. When the fashioning of the universe had been completed, day separated from night, the sun and the moon and the mov- able fires in the heavens, i.e., the movable stars, assigned their courses, the fixed stars given their stations, and the reckoning of time begun, the gods built their mansions. Of Odin's mansion Valhqll we read: Doors five hundred and forty more I ween may be found in Valhall; and eight hundred Chosen pass through each at once when they fare to fight the Wolf.6 And the Wandering Questioner asks:7 "Where is the chief abode or holy place of the gods?" And Hârr answers: "That is at the Ash Yggdrasill; there the gods must give judgment every day." Then the Wanderer asks: "What is to be said concern- ing that place?" And Jafnhârr answers: "The Ash is greatest of all trees and best; its limbs spread out over all the world and stand above heaven. The poem says of the tree Yggdrasill: An Ash I know standing, 'tis called Yggdrasill, a high tree sprinkled with shining drops; come dews therefrom which fall in the dales; it stands ever green o'er the Well of Weird.* The word weird means 'Fate'. The Ash Yggdrasill is a symbol of the world; it is the tree of life and fate. Its appearance and con- dition reflect at all times the state of the world. The events briefly outlined above belong to the Golden age of the world; here we see Yggdrasill standing 'ever green.' The Vçluspâ, in 6 Grimmismâl, 23. 7 In the Prose Edda. 8 Vçluspâ, 19.</page><page sequence="15">149 stanzas 7-8, describes the peaceful, happy time among the gods: Then gathered the gods on the Fields of Labor; courts and temples they set on high, - they founded forges, wrought rich treasures, tongs they hammered and fashioned tools. They played at tables and were joyous, - little they wanted for wealth of gold. And Act I of the drama closes with a note of ill omen by the mention of the coming of the three mighty Norns, the Fate- Sisters from the Giant World. In Act II the rule of the gods is challenged by the giants. A rival race of gods invades Äsgard. Odin hurled the shot mid the host, and the first great war in the world raged. The Vanir- Gods make good their demands; there follows a truce, and terms of peace are agreed on : the Vanir are accepted into the family of gods; however, Odin continues to rule from his High-Seat in Hlídskjâlf; and Thor remains second in rank; but the Vangod Frey now ranks third. With these events, and others which must be here passed over, the age of peace is over; instead there has come strife, and with it death and fate enter. "Oaths were broken, solemn treaties were violated," says the Vala. Evil has definitely challenged good in the world. Finally, the entrance of Loki as a god in Asgard, shows that the giants have taken the offensive, and are carrying the war into the very mansions of the gods. And with this mention of Loki we may fittingly close Act II, for here is foreshadowed the fateful climactic event in Act III, the central fact in the Drama of Norse Mythology. It is the Death of Balder caused by Loki. I shall read the Myth of Balder in an archaeizing rendering.9 Balder's Death. The beginning is this, that Balder the Good dreamed great and perilous dreams touching his life. When he told these dreams to the ¿Esir, they took counsel together, and this was their decision: to ask safety for Balder from all kinds of dangers. And Frigg took oaths to this purport, that fire and water should spare Balder, likewise iron, and metal of all kinds, 9 1 am here using Arthur G. Brodeur's translation: The Prose Edda. N. Y. 1916. This is the best rendering in English.</page><page sequence="16">ISO stones, earth, trees, sicknesses, beasts, birds, venom, serpents. And when that was done and made known, it was a diversion of Balder and the ^Esir, that he should stand up in the Assembly, and all the others should, some shoot at him, some hew at him, some beat him with stones. But whatsoever was done hurt him not at all; and that seemed to them all a very worshipful thing. But when Loki Laufeyarson saw this, it pleased him ill that Balder took no hurt. He went to Fensalir to Frigg, and made himself into the likeness of a woman. Then Frigg asked if that woman knew what the JEsir did at the Assembly (Thing). She said that all were shooting at Balder, and moreover that he took no hurt. Then said Frigg: "Neither weapons nor wood may hurt Balder: I have taken oaths of them all." Then the woman asked: "Have all things taken oaths to spare Balder?" And Frigg answered: "There grows a treesprout alone westward of Valhall; it is called Mistletoe; I thought it too young to ask the oath of." Then straightway the woman turned away; but Loki took Mistletoe and pulled it up and went to the Assembly. Hoder stood outside the ring of men, because he was blind. Then spake Loki to him: "Why dost thou not shoot at Balder?" He answered: "Because I see not where Balder is; and for this also, that I am weaponless." Then said Loki: "Do thou also after the manner of other men, and show Balder honor as the other men do. I will direct where he stands; shoot at him with this wand." Hoder took mistletoe and shot at Balder, being guided by Loki; the shaft flew through Balder, and he fell dead to the Earth. And that was the greatest mischance that has ever befallen among gods and men. Then, when Balder was fallen, words failed all the JEsir, and their hands likewise, to take hold of him; each looked at the other, and all were of one mind as to him who had wrought the work, but none might take vengeance, so great a sanctuary was in that place. But when the ¿Esir tried to speak, then it befell (first) that weeping broke out, so that none might speak to the others with words concerning his grief. Bur Odin bore that mis- fortune so much the worst, as he had most perception of how great harm and loss for the JEsii were in the death of Balder. Now when the gods had come to themselves, Frigg spake,</page><page sequence="17">151 and asked who there might be among the ¿Esir who would fain win for himself all her favor: let him ride the road to the "Nether Realm, and seek if he may find Balder, and offer Hel a ransom if she will let Balder come home to Asgard. And he is named Hertnod the bold, Odin's son, who undertook that embassy. Then Sleipner was taken, Odin's steed, and led forward; and Hermod mounted on that horse and galloped off." Then there follows the account of the ship-burial of Balder. "Hringhorni is the name of Balder's ship; it was the greatest of all ships, and the gods made Balder's pyre thereon." "Then was the body of Balder borne out on shipboard; and when his wife Nanna, the daughter of Nep, saw that, straightway her heart burst with grief, and so she died; she was borne to the pyre, and fire was kindled." "People of many races came to this burning. Balder's horse was led to the bale-fire with all his trappings." "Now this is to be told concerning Hermod, that he rode nine nights through dark dales and deep, so that he saw not before he was come to the river G joli and rode onto the G joli Bridge; which bridge is thatched with glittering gold. ModgutSr is the name of the maiden called who guards the bridge; she asked him his name and race, saying that the day before there had ridden over the bridge five companies of dead men; 'but the bridge thunders no less under thee alone, and thou hast not the color of dead men. Why ridest thou hither on Helway?' He answered: 'I am appointed to ride to Hel to seek out Balder. Hast thou perchance seen Balder on Helway?' She said that Balder had ridden there over GjolPs Bridge - 'but down and north lieth Helway.' "Then Hermod rode on till he came to Helgate; he dis- mounted from his steed and made his girth fast, mounted and and pricked him with his spurs; and the steed leaped so hard over the gate that he came nowise near to it. Then Hermod rode home to the hall and dismounted from his steed, went into the hall, and saw sitting there in the high-seat Balder, his brother; and Hermod tarried there over night. At morn Hermod prayed Hel that Balder might ride home with him, and told her how great weeping was among the iEsir. But Hel said that in this</page><page sequence="18">152 wise it should be put to the test, whether Balder were so all- beloved as had been said: "If all things in the world, quick and dead, weep for him, then he shall go back to the iEsir; but he shall remain with Hel if any gainsay it or will not weep." Then Hermod arose; but Balder led him out of the hall, and took the ring Draupnir and sent it to Odin for a remembrance. And Nanna sent Frigg a linen smock, and yet more gifts, and to Fulla golden finger-ring." "Then Hermod rode his way back, and came into Asgard, and told all those tidings which he had seen and heard. There- upon the -¿Esir sent over all the world messengers to pray that Balder be wept out of Hel; and all men did this, and quick things, and the earth, and stones, and trees, and all metals, - " .... "Then when the messengers went home, having well wrought their errand, they found in a certain cave, where a giantess sat: she called herself Thokk. They prayed her to weep Balder out of Hel; she answered: Thokk will weep waterless tears For Balder's bale-faring; Living or dead I loved not the churl's son; Let Hel hold that which she hath. And men deem that she who was there was Loki Laufeyarson, who hath wrought most ill among the iEsir." The Balder myth, most of which I have here read to you, appears in Chapter XLIX of the Prose Edda. The myth does not appear, except for references to it, in the Poetic Edda; but the stanza given at the very end of the myth in the prose ver- sion shows that there was a poem on it. The Poetic Edda has a short poem called Balder's Dreams. In Odin's Descent to the seeress in the Realm of Death he asks her for the meaning of Balder's threatening dreams, and he learns that Balder will be slain, and also how that murder will be avenged; but the poem stops there. The myth of Balder's Death represents the battle between light and darkness in the daily succession of day and night. But if it had remained only that we should also have had a poem on the subject, in which Balder would have been the victor. From being a day-myth it became a year-myth, a battle between sum-</page><page sequence="19">153 mer and winter, between the year-day and the year-night. This was a natural development in the Scandinavian Penninsula, where the summer is a continuous day, and the winter for half of its duration is continuous night. Gradually the myth took on the deeper significance of the struggle between the forces of light and truth and all that is good against the demons of darkness and falsehood, and all that is evil. Thus the Death of Balder, the god of truth and purity, Balder the gentle and the just, - Balder Slain, portends the ultimate doom of the gods, and the end of the world, the world which the gods have created. From this climax in the mythological drama the descending action starts. From now the forces of the giants increase in number and power; that the gods are waging a losing fight Odin alone knows. In Vafthrûdnismâl, a contest in wisdom between Riddle-Reader and Vafthrtfönir, the wisest of the giants, the latter, when testing the wisdom of his challenging guest Riddle- Reader, asks: what is the Field called where Dark Surt and the Gracious Gods shall meet in battle, Riddle-Reader had an- swered : Vigrid is the Field where shall meet in battle Surt and the Gracious Gods; a hundred miles it measures each way; 'tis the Field marked out by Fate. And the Riddle-Reader was Odin. Yes, Odin knows; and when Balder died he knew also that Ragnarçk, the great crisis, is even now impending. Yet at no time to the very end is there any thought in his mind but to carry on the fight relentlessly to the last, to save Asgard and the world from the great doom. It is as if he were determined to defeat Fate herself in her terrible decree. He accepts proudly every challenge; he seeks out the foe and challenges him. It is a magnificent myth, the Odin-myth. It is a masterly portrayal of the quality of a leader: pride, courage, sense of responsibility, determination, and resourcefulness. And at the same time the god Thor battles in the more physical sphere, as he goes daily and searches out a giant always with his hammer, which every time it is hurled crushes a giant's skull, and then returns to</page><page sequence="20">154 Thor's hand. And Eeimdal stands ever guard at the heaven end of the Rainbow-bridge against the coming of the demons of destruction. Odin knows, of course, that if you are to win in a war against a merely physical foe the war must be fought ulti- mately in the physical sphere, when this foe marches his hosts against you. And so he prepares for this, and Valhall becomes the Other- World home of all who in life on earth have distin- guished themselves for courage and heroism. And so Odin, the god of wind, who had become the god of Wisdom, and the god of all Intellectual Endeavor, becomes the God of War. And he establishes the institution of the Valkyries, the Choosers of the Slain; their office it becomes, as the emissaries of Odin on the battlefield, to choose the heroes in battle and carry them to Val- hall, which word means the Hall of the Slain, and where the Chosen Heroes (Einherjar) live and feast with Odin and the gods until Ragnarok, when they go out and battle by the side of the gods. And as War-God Odin indeed encourages War, through which chiefly he is able to swell the hosts of his heroes in Valhall. After the Death of Balder Loki escaped and went into hiding; he went to Fránangr Falls, changed himself into the shape of a salmon, and held forth there. But from his high-seat in Hliösk- jalf Odin discovered where Loki was hiding. Odin and the JEsir then captured Loki near Fránangr Falls, and took him to a certain cave, drilled a hole in three rocks and bound him to these. Over him a venomous serpent was fastened, so that the venom should drip from the serpent into his face. But Sigyn, Loki's wife, stands near him and holds a basin under the venom- drops; and when the basin is full, she goes and pours out the venom, but in the meantime the venom drips into his face. Then he writhes against it with such force that all the world trembles. There Loki lies in bonds till Ragnarok. Thus the IVth Act closes. But in spite of these successes it goes steadily worse with the gods, and with the world. In Grîmnismâl, 35, we are told this in these lines: Yggdrasil's Ash suffers anguish more than mortal has ever known; a hart gnaws it above, it rots at the side, and Nidhoggr rends it beneath.</page><page sequence="21">155 and elsewhere: More serpents lie under Yggdrasil's Ash than a witless fool would ween. Our principal source for the myth at this point is the Vçluspâ (The Word of the Prophetess) ; but its account is supplemented by many other poems; and in the Prose Edda there is a rather complete form of it. The Vçluspâ has for its subject the mytho- logical history of the world. It does this in pithy, solemn, poetic narrative, dealing only with the high points in the epic: chaos; the creation of the world; the creation of man; the golden age; the coming of evil; the institution of war; the signs of doom; and the end of the world. It is a poem unparalleled in the grandeur of its conception. The poem is essentially a prophecy about the manner in which the world will be destroyed; this is preceded by an account of the signs of doom, and the warning to all living things as Heimdal blows his Gjallarhorn. Of these signs I shall select a few. The conditions that pre- cede the signs are widespread moral decay in the world, and inces- sant warfare. The first sign of the coming catastrophe is related by Hârr in answer to GanglerVs question: "First there shall come that winter which is called Fimbuhetr, 'The Monster Win- ter of Terrors.' In that time snow shall drive from all quarters; frosts shall be great then, and winds sharp; there shall be no virtue in the sun. Those winters shall proceed three in succes- sion, and no summer in between; but first shall come three other winters, such that over all the world there shall be mighty battles." Then . . . "there shall be great floods as the Midgard Serpent stirs in giant wrath, lashes the waves and advances up onto the land. Loki will break his bonds; the Fenriswolf gets loose." . . . "Now the Ash Yggdrassill shall groan and nothing shall then be without fear in heaven or in earth." . . . "Then shall the JEsix put on their war-weeds, and all the Champions, and advance to the Field: Odin rides first with the gold helmet and a fair byrnie, and his spear, which is called the Gungnir." At this point the poem says: Soon comes to pass Frigg's second grief, when Odin fares to fight with the wolf; then must fall her lord beloved.</page><page sequence="22">156 Of Thor we get a final glimpse in another stanza: Strikes in his wrath the Warder of Midgard, while mortals all their homes forsake. and finally: The Sun is darkened, Earth sinks in the sea, then fall from heavens the Sparkling Stars ; smoke-reek rages and reddening fire: the high heat licks against Heaven itself. Thus the end of the world comes through a world-conflagra- tion and a world-flood. But the world-conflagration is of second- ary importance here, and perhaps not a part of the original Northern myth. The important features here are the monster winter and the world-flood. The belief that it is through these that the end will come is natural to a cold northern region with its winters of darkness. In times of unusually long winters there was always the fear in the early Middle Ages that summer and light would never return. Then that would be the end of the world. It is seen also that the myth pictures to us a return to the condition of chaos as it was before creation: darkness and water everywhere. But man could not accept this as the end of all. The giants have been destroyed; but could the gods of Asgard also have been destroyed? That he refused to believe. Evil had been de- stroyed; but good must survive. Furthermore, he reasoned, the world was originally created out of chaos; and light came, and the gods, and the race of man. And so it will be again. Earth will rise again from the waters of Ragnarok. And the Vala says: I see uprising a second time Earth from the ocean green anew; Then gather the gods on the Fields of Labour ; they speak concerning the great World-Flood, they remember there the mighty doom and the ancient runes of Fimbultyr. And in the following stanzas at the end of the poem we find named those of the Asa-gods who have returned, namely Balder, Hçdr, and Hœnir, fand 'The sons of Odin's brothers/ In the</page><page sequence="23">157 corresponding chapter of the Prose Edda, further, are enu- merated the gods Vidar and Vali, and Thor's two sons: Modi and Magni. Thus it is some of the sons of the old gods that return. Odin, God of War, does not return, nor, as we see, many of the others. The word Ragnarçk means the Fate of the Powers, i.e., the Destruction of all those older ruling gods who had com- promised with the giants and with evil. When Balder Slain was placed on the funeral pyre in his ship, and as it was about to be launched, Odin whispered some- thing in Balder's ear. What was it that Odin whispered in the ear of his son Balder Slain? The question was often asked after Balder's Faring. But not answered. Only Odin himself knew. We today, reading the myth, knowing what Balder symbolized in the life and belief of the time, we, perhaps, also know. And yet, what did Odin whisper in Balder's ear when Balder's Burial-ship was launched? February 28, 1937 George T. Flom</page></plain_text>
