Oosten University of Leiden RÉSUMÉ : La structure du complexe chamanique chez les Netsilik et les Iglulik On étudie généralement le chamanisme comme un phénomène religieux et idéologique, en faisant ressortir les ressemblances transculturelles du complexe chamanique mais en sous-estimant les différences, qui se révèlent pourtant nombreuses. Lewis ( Ecstatic Religion , 1971) nous fournit un cadre théorique utile à l'analyse sociologique du chama- nisme avec la distinction entre cultes de possession « centraux » et « périphériques » . Cependant le chamanisme inuit ne saurait être rangé de façon absolue dans l'une ou l'autre catégorie. Il est ouvert à divers groupes : les chasseurs pauvres et les riches, les hommes et les femmes. Mais si les femmes peuvent y participer l'opposition idéologique entre les sexes qui prévaut dans la culture inuit, se reflète aussi dans l'idéologie, la pratique et la structure sociale du chamanisme. ABSTRACT : The structure of the shamanistic complex among the Netsilik and Iglulik. Shamanism is usually studied as a religious and ideological phenomenon. Resemblances between shamanistic complexes in different cultures are often stressed, while differences are underestimated. In studying the social structure of shamanism in various cultures many differences become apparent. A useful theoretical framework for the sociological study of shamanism is offered by Lewis in Ecstatic Religion (1971). He distinguishes between central and peripheral possession cults. Inuit shamanism however, cannot be classified unambiguously in either of these categories. The shamanistic complex offers scope to all kinds of people: poor hunters and successful hunters, men and women. Although both men and women can perform as shamans, the ideological opposition between men and women in Inuit culture is also reflected in the different ideological, structural and social practice aspects of Inuit shamanism. Introduction Shamanism was one of the most conspicuous features of traditional Inuit religion. From the moment research among the Inuit first started until modern times, explorers and ÉTUDES /INUIT /STUDIES, 1981 Vol. 5 N° 1 83</page><page sequence="2">ethnologists were fascinated by shamanistic performances and practices. Even when shamanism had disappeared as a living reality attempts were made to investigate the subject further among the christianised Inuit (cf. Briggs 1970). As a consequence we have much factual knowledge about Inuit shamanism and one could wonder whether there is still need to explore this subject any further. After all, it may be argued, Inuit shamanism and Inuit religion have irrevocably disappeared and consequently no additional factual information is likely to be recovered. It should be clear, however, that as anthropology develops, new questions are raised, new problems become relevant and further research on themes that seemed completely explored is required. Shamanism is such a theme. Shamanism is one of these vague and general concepts like "mana" and "taboo" which have haunted the anthropological study of religion for a long time. The word shaman" is derived from the Tungusic word 4 'saman" and refers to a religious specialist in trance and exstasy, who plays an important part in the communication between men and spirits. Like taboo and mana the word shaman was originally an emic term. It was developed into an etic term, but it never quite lost many of its emic connotations. The shaman par excellence is still the Siberian and particularly the Tungusic shaman. It would be probably better to replace the term altogether by a more neutral one like spirit medium, but the term shaman has become so popular that this is hardly feasible. The term shamanism refers to a set of ideas, practices, ritual objects and symbols associated with shamans. Many authors have tried to determine the essence and the origin of this complex phenomenon. The most comprehensive study was made by Eliade (1964). He considers shamanism mainly as a religious phenomenon. For him the technique of ecstasy is the essence of the shamanistic complex. A shaman is able to control his trance and he can employ therefore his supernatural powers to the benefit of his fellow men. Eliade uses the terms shaman and shamanism as general categories which are to be applied to phenomena of trance and ecstasy in different parts of the world. Other authors are particularly interested in the age of the shamanistic complex and restrict their research to a particular area of the wold. Findeisen analyses the shamanistic complex in Siberia, the locus classicus of shamanism, and relates it to the religion of the prehistoric hunters. According to him, a shaman is already depicted in the caves of Trois-Frères (Findeisen 1957: 7-8; Abb. 5). Vajda on the other hand considers shamanism to be a relatively recent development. He concludes that the shamanistic complex did not predate the bronze age (Vadja 1957: 295). These researchers represent a classic tradition in the exploration of the shamanistic complex. They are mainly interested in its origin and essence. Whether shamanism is considered as a worldwide phenomenon (Eliade) or a particular religious tradition in the northern hemisphere (Findeisen, Vadja), these authors all share a phenomenological approach. They are interested in shamanism as a religious phenomenon. Their studies present a clear, general outline of the shamanistic complex among different native peoples in Siberia and North America. Different elements (trance, exstasy, initiation, control of helping spirits, paraphernalia like drum, shaman belt, etc.) constitute, in 84/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="3">various combinations, the general pattern of the shamanistic complex. Based on such research, an ideal type of shamanism has been developped, although the authors tend to lay too much stress on the resemblances between shamanistic complexes in different cultures, while underestimating the importance of cultural differences. It is clear that the shamanistic complexes among for example the Tungus, the Chuckchee, and the Inuit can be considered as variants of each other, but this does not necessarily mean that they can be reduced to one particular ideal type or essence. Shamanism in a society is part of its culture and differences in culture will have effect on the shamanistic complex. Shamanism can be considered as a family resemblance in the sense that this concept was developed by Wittgenstein (1963: 32). The same word refers to different complexes that need not necessarily have one particular essence or one particular feature in common. This situation also obtains for the word shaman. The word refers to a specialist in trance and ecstasy who may have different functions, paraphernalia or social status in different cultures. A structural analysis of these differences would be of great importance for our understanding of shamanism. Why are shamans dressed in some cultures as women and not in others? Why do shamans have a high social status in some cultures and not in others? An anthropological or sociological theory of shamanism is needed to answer these questions. Towards an anthropological theory of shamanism. Most theories of shamanism explain the shamanistic complex in psychological terms. In the course of time many attempts have been made to interpret shamans in such terms of western psychology as neurotics, hysterics, sexual perverts (cf. the concept of arctic hysteria in Ohlmarks' discussion of the shamanistic complex). To some extent this can be explained by the ethnocentric reactions of the researchers towards the shamanistic complex. Shamanism has always struck western ethnologists as a strange and abnormal phenomenon. They could not imagine that normal people would indulge in such practices. As anthropological theory developed most anthropologist accepted that 4 'primitive people" were perfectly capable of rational thinking. Shamanistic beliefs and practices could be shown to be perfectly reasonable in the context of their own culture and consequently these interpretations of shamans as deviant people are now rejected by most anthropologists. Shamans are now usually considered as responsible people who need considerable social skill to perform adequately in their function (cf. Murphy 1969). However, their most important functions are still explained in psychological terms. Even Lewis' book, Ecstatic Religion , which is conceived as a sociological approach to the study of possession religions, ends very much on a psychological note. The psychological explanations of shamanistic phenomena are usually of a very general type and stress, for example, the cathartic value of public confessions (La Barre 1969), the importance of the release of hidden tensions or suppressed anxieties (Balikci 1969, 1970). Such explanations are certainly helpful, but they are not completely THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /85</page><page sequence="4">satisfactory from an anthropological point of view. Fear, anxiety and tension have to be cultural variables that have to be given stucture and content by the anthropologist in the course of his research. Which fears are resolved? How? Which anxieties are released and which are not? Lévi-Strauss considers that fear and anxiety develop where an inability to cope with a situation in cognitive terms exists (Lévis-Strauss 197 1 : 588-9). An adequate understanding of fear, tension and anxiety in a culture would require, consequently, a thorough analysis of its cognitive perspective of the world. As shaman plays an important part in the social life of his society his functions in society cannot be explained satisfactorily in only psychological terms. An anthropological approach to the study of shamanism should not only refer to the cognitive level of the shamanistic complex, but also to the practice of shamanism and its organisation as a social institution. It should include a thorough examination of social position, social status, prerogatives and functions of the shaman in different societies. There is a need of more differentiated studies of the shamanistic complex in different cultures in terms of their respective social organisations. For example, who could become shamans (men, women, influential people, marginal people)? Did all shamans have the same functions? A theoretical framework that can serve as a point of departure for an anthropological approach is developped by Lewis in his book mentioned above (1971). Lewis discusses shamanism in the more general context of possession cults. He is not so much interested in essence and origin of these cults as their sociological structure. He distinguishes between two types of possession cults: a) main morality cults or central possession cults, and b) peripheral possession cults. Main morality cults or central possession cults sustain the dominant values and morals in a society while peripheral possession cults usually involve spirits of a marginal kind (for example, spirits of foreign origin or minor spirits) that are indifferent to moral issues. Central possession cults derive their support from a cultural elite with vested interests, while peripheral possession cults often recruit their members among marginal and oppressed such as slaves, foreigners, and women. These peripheral cults often have a revolutionary potential. The leaders of peripheral possession cults are often considered dangerous by the cultural elite. Their influence is often restricted by a potential threat of witchcraft accusations: if the leaders of peripheral possession cults direct their shamanistic faculties against the cultural elit^ they may be accused of witchcraft and consequently be persecuted and even killed (Lewis 1971: 124-126). Lewis considers central possession cults in small societies as reactions to external pressures (ecological, military; ibid.: 175-6), while peripheral possession cults are thought to originate out of internal pressures (tensions between different strata or gioups in the same society). The distinction between peripheral and central possession cults as developed by Lewis is useful, but it cannot always be strictly maintained. Many possession cults have features of both types and it is not always possible to classify such cults unambiguously as either a central or a peripheral possession cult. This becomes immediately apparent in 86/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="5">Lewis' discussion of the shamanistic complex among the Inuit. Lewis concludes that although the Inuit spirits are amoral in nature the shamanistic complex involves the whole of Inuit society, not one particular group or sector. Inuit shamanism should therefore be considered as a central possession cult ( 1 97 1 : 1 63- 1 70) . This conclusion is not entirely convincing as Inuit shamanism has features of both types of possession cults and this situation should be explained. We know that among the Inuit both men and women could become shamans. Although this information is generally accepted by anthropologists, it is nevertheless surprising when we consider the theoretical literature on shamanism to find that the opposition between male and female is a crucial issue in shamanism in many cultures (cf. Sternberg's discussion of the sexual relationships between shamans and their helping spirits [Sternberg 1925]), as is the problem of transvestilism in shamanism in many cultures, e.g. the Siberian Yuit etc.). The opposition male-female is also of crucial importance in Inuit religion where the domains of male and female are usually strictly separated (cf. Oosten 1976; Saladin d'Anglure 1978). It would indeed by surprising if the opposition of male and female was not of great importance in Inuit shamanism. The information that both men and women could become angakkut therefore should not be accepted at face value. We will have to examine the available data more closely in order to ascertain its value. Ethnographers like Boas, Bogoras and Rasmussen usually give systematic and coherent descriptions of the shamanistic complex, but they do not attempt to discover whether different interpretations of the shamanistic complex are provided by different people. As a consequence their descriptions of shamanism suggest more homogeneity than probably existed. It is quite possible that this apparently homogeneous complex refers to a very heterogeneous social reality and that the term shaman refers to specialists in different fields representing different interests and groups. In this paper I will discuss structure of the shamanistic complex among two Inuit groups, the Netsilik and the Iglulik. Special attention will be given to the social position of the angakkut and the opposition male-female in Inuit shamanism. I will attempt to determine not only whether Inuit shamanism can be considered as a central or a peripheral possession cult in terms of Lewis' theory, but also how features of both types are interwoven in the shamanistic complex. Following a general outline of Inuit shamanism I will discuss three levels of Inuit shamanism: a) the ideological level - the ideology of shamanism. b) the practical level - the practice of shamanism. c) the social level - the social organisation of shamanism. The angakkut The word angakkoq or angatkoq (pl. -kut) is usually translated as shaman. According to Thalbitzer the word is derived from angak , mother's brother, while the suffix -kkuq means member of the family. He thinks the term is a residue of a matrilineal tradition among the Inuit (Thalbitzer 1928: 423). We have no evidence that the mother's brother THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /87</page><page sequence="6">was the most suitable person to act as an angakkoq in Inuit society, but we should not exclude the possibility that this may have been the case in the past. If Thalbitzer's interpretation is correct it seems probable that the term angakkoq originally referred to a relative position in the kinship system, not to a specific function or office. In that case the mother's brother may originally have been a ritual instructor, supervisor or initiator of his sister's son. Most authors tend to ascribe to the angakkut a specific function or office in Inuit society. Hultkrantz even distinguishes between angakkut and laymen although he stresses at the same time that there was no clear distinction between angakkut and other people (cf. Hultkrantz 1962: 397 ff.). It would seem probable that all Inuit could act as angakkut if necessary. Angakkut performed the same tasks as other Inuit but they were endowed with special gifts that enabled them to perform as angakkut. It is best therefore to consider the angakkut as specialists and not as office holders or priests. Every angakkoq usually had particular specialties in which he excelled. The most important tasks of the angakkut were to procure game in times of scarcity, to cure the sick, to drive away evil spirits, to expose hidden transgressions and to influence the weather. The angakkut were able to perform these tasks because they were initiated by the spirits. This initiation was the crucial part of the training of an angakkoq. Rasmussen presents us with descriptions of the traditional training of angakkut in Inuit society (Rasmussen 1929: 111-114, 1931: 296; cf. also Balicki 1970: 225), but the ones he actually met were not trained in this way. The training he describes was clearly an ideal pattern that was not actually conformed to in ethnographic reality. It may have been different in the past when Inuit culture was much richer in ritual. One of the recurrent themes in the description of the training periods is the instruction by an elder angakkoq. It is not quite clear of what this instruction consisted. Ethnographic literature makes it clear that the special terminology of the angakkut or their supply of tricks were not at all secret. They were well known by all Inuit. Even the children were acquainted with them. Among the Iglulingmiut the instructor was expected to give the pupil his angakk.ua (i.e. his angakkoq) or qaumaneq (enlightenment) which enabled the pupil to see through the dark and perceive the past, the future, the whole world and all the souls wherever they might be hidden. Saladin ď Anglure has demonstrated the great importance of qaumaneq in Inuit ideology (Saladin d'Anglure 1978). The most important purpose of the instruction was probably to prepare the aspirant angakkoq for the initial confrontation with the spirits. This was the crucial experience for all angakkut. In these confrontations they acquired their helping spirits which enabled them to function as angakkut. Rasmussen gives many examples and it is interesting to note that many of these confrontations happened quite unexpectedly and without any preparation. Confrontations with spirits were not limited to the angakkut. Every man could meet spirits, but this did not necessarily imply that he became an angakkoq. This happened only if there was general agreement that the experience should be interpreted as a 88/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="7">summons of the spirits to become an angakkoq. Once an Inuk had gained control of a helping spirit he could practice as an angakkoq. Different techniques and categories of shamans could be distinguished. Balikci (1970: 227) distinguishes between the angakkoq and the angatkunguruk (lesser angakkoq) among the Netsilik. The angatkunguruk had less control over his helping spirits. Another type of shaman was the qilajuq who specialised in the technique of qilaneq (to be discussed later). The distinctions between different categories were probably not very strict in ethnographic reality. The ideology of shamanism Ideologies are systems of ideas or beliefs (Gellner 1978: 69). Gellner distinguishes between a) the social construction of reality and b) the role of ideology within society (p. 76). This distinction is fruitful, but categories like k'the social construction of reality" or 4 'our total vision of reality" (p. 81) should be handled with care. The idea that each culture or even each person has a total vision of reality that constitutes a meaningful whole is questionable. Different perspectives of the world may exist among different groups in the same society (cf. Ardener's discussion of the difference between male and female perspectives of the world; Ardener 1977). It seems fruitful to investigate whether different ideological perspectives of the world are determined by the same set of rules. It is this set of rules, not the systems they generate, that constitutes the ultimate order ("ordre des ordres") of a particular culture. Hamayon rightly stressed the importance of ideology in shamanism, but unfortunately she does not consider the possibility that more than one ideology may be expressed in the shamanistic complex. She argues that the Buryat shaman maintains the ideological order of the universe. Transgressions of this order can only be repaired by the shaman who is entitled to transgress the cultural order because of his ambiguous status in terms of life and death. He has passed through an ordeal consisting of symbolic death and resurrection and therefore he belongs both to the domain of the living and the dead (cf. Hamayon 1978: 24). In many respects the Inuit angakkoq had the same ambiguous position. The shamanistic complex cannot be studied as an isolated phenomenon. It was an integral part of Inuit religion. The activities of the angakkut were only meaningful within the religious context. Inuit religion was animistic, all things being potentially endowed with a spiritual nature. Man's interaction with the world around him was to a large extent determined by his spiritual dimension of the world. Relations with the inuat, the anthropomorphic spiritual powers of the world, should not be disturbed. A complex system of ritual injuction regulated the relations between men and spirits. Transgressions of these ritual injuctions disturbed the delicate balance of these relations and, as a consequence, hunger, disease or scarcity of game, among other calamities would result. These consequences were not considered as automatic mechanisms that regulated the order of the world, but as intentional actions of the spirits that were angry with the Inuit. At the same time the complex of ritual injunctions can be interpreted as a system that maintains the order of the world (Oosten 1976; 64-78). The angakkoq could try to prevent THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /89</page><page sequence="8">or to overcome the negative consequences of transgressions of these rules, but he could not freely transgress these rules himself. His ambiguity in terms of life and death enabled him to penetrate into the worlds of the spirits and the dead ancestors in the sky and the sea, but he could not break the rules that determined the order of the world and his own position as an angakkoq. The most important spirit who punished ritual transgressions were the inuat of the sea, the moon and the sky, the spirits of the animals (especially game) and the spirits of the dead. Whenever, disease or hunger or other similar misfortune occurred it was the task of the angakkoq to trace the causes and to restore the balance between men and spirits. The angakkoq had to discover in trance which ritual injunctions had been transgressed and which spirit(s) were responsible for the disaster. He had to give instructions how relations could be restored and he had to subdue the spirit that caused the disaster. The Inuit told Rasmussen that the angakkut of their time no longer matched the magical feats of their predecessors. This statement should not be accepted at face value. It had clearly an ideological base. Inuit religion was undoubtedly on the decline and the Inuit were very well aware of it. The great ritual festivities of the past were gradually omitted and the system of ritual injunctions was desintegrating. At the same time this does not necessarily mean that shamanism was also on the decline. On the contrary. The decline of traditional institutions like the feasting house or the great winter festivals may well have contributed to a further development of the shamanistic complex (Oosten 1976: 96). We know that witchcraft was expanding (Carpenter 1968) and we have no indications that shamanism was really declining. Therefore one is inclined to attach more importance to the ideological dimension of this statement. Just as magical spells are often founded on their efficacy in a mythical past the prestige of the shamanistic complex is increased by mythical tales about legendary angakkut. Many tales of this kind can be found among the Inuit. Relations between the angakkoq and the spirits were ambivalent. He derived his shamanistic faculties from his control over the helping spirits. At the same time there was often an aspect of hostility between the angakkoq and his helping spirits. Most helping spirits made their appearance by attacking the angakkoq and even after they had been subdued the angakkoq had to be on his guard against his helping spirits and had to prove his superiority over them again and again (Rasmussen 1929: 121; 1931: 295). The angakkoq Niviatsian was nearly killed by his first helping spirit and he had to subdue his next helping spirits in violent fights (Rasmussen 1929: 120-21). This aggressive attitude was also present in the relations between the angakkut and the great inuat of the sea and the sky. The relations with the inua of the moon were usually more congenial. * The major feats of the angakkut in traditional shamanism were their journeys to the inua of the moon (Aninga), and the spirit of the sea (Nuliajuk). The moon spirit represented important male virtues (he was considered a great hunter, represented the idea of male fertility and was thought to be a friend of hunters and orphans). The female virtues of fertility were represented by Nuliajuk. She was the mother of life (mankind and animals), but at the same time she was a dangerous power. She could not be trusted and 90/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="9">the angakkoq had to control her. When she was angry and withheld the game the angakkoq had to compel her, often by physical force, to free the game again. Another female spirit figured in these seances was Aukjuk, who lived in the land of the moon spirit. She tried to make the angakkoq laugh and when he could not restrain himself and started to laugh she cut open his belly with her knife and devoured his entrails. The hunter that could not restrain himself thus became food, a transformation that was usually reserved to women (cf. the transformation of Nuliajuk's fingers into game, the transformation of Aninga's (grand) mother into a narwhal, etc.). The angakkoq had to prove his superiority in relation to these female spirits, but there exist no myths of a comparable antagonism between the moon spirit and the angakkut among the Netsilik and Iglulik. The fundamental opposition between male and female in Inuit culture would thus be reflected in the shamanistic complex if we could assume that the angakkut were men. The opposition between men and women in Inuit culture was most clear in the contrast of hunting (male) and childbirth and menstruation (female). Women who had just been menstruating or had recently delivered a child and hunters should avoid each other as much as possible. Women in these particular conditions are usually referred to as unclean in anthropological literature. Jean Briggs suggested to me that this term is in fact inappropriate. These women are not unclean but in a state of power connected with the source of life. This particular state of power is the female counterpart of the masculine power as it is expressed in male activities of hunting and begetting children. Men, women and game were related to each other in a complex pattern of oppositions (Oosten 1976: 94-95). The killing of game and the impregnation of women were symbolically on the same level (Cf. the symbolism of the hunting at the breathing hole and the harpooning of Nuliajuk [Boas 1880: 604; Rasmussen 1930: 226]). The killing of game guaranteed the continuity of society in terms of food, the impregnating of women guaranteed the continuity of society in terms of offspring. Women and food were closely associated. The most important game originated out of a transformation of women who did not conform to cultural rules and were killed by men (Nuliajuk by her father [Iglulik] or children [Netsilik), Aninga's [grand] mother by her [grand] son). Women and game were thought to be closely associated on a natural level (cf. also the frequent references in myth and reality to sexual intercourse between hunters and game they had killed recorded in ethnographic sources) and had to be kept separate in a cultural level when they were most close to each other on a cognitive level. The woman who had just been menstruating or had just delivered a child and was, therefore, marked by her association with the creation of life, and the animal that just had been killed and was, therefore, transformed into food, represented opposite poles in the system of ritual injunctions in Inuit culture. The metonymical relation between women and sea game in the mythical past (women transformed into animals) was transformed into a metaphorical relation in the present (metaphor of killing and impregnating) and both domains had to be kept apart. Men had killed the women in the past and thus transformed them into food. Now men killed the game and brought it as food to the women. The procuring of game was essentially a man's task. Women could have no part in this unless they transformed themselves into men as sometimes happened in mythical tales (cf. Rasmussen 1931: THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /91</page><page sequence="10">303-4). Therefore it seems improbable that female angakkut performed in seances for that purpose. The ideology of the shamanistic complex was essentially a viricentric ideology. The angakkoq behaved aggressively towards the spirits, subdued them by physical force and the most important female spirits (Aukjuk in the land in the sky and Nuliajuk in the land on the bottom of the sea) were his main antagonists. The shamans had enlightenment ( qaumaneq ) and mobility, the inua of the sea was handicapped by blindness and immobility. This opposition is a central theme in Inuit religion. In the shamanistic seance the angakkut were traditionally bound and all lamps were extinguished in the igloo. They freed themselves from their fetters and travelled wherever they wanted to go and saw everything they wanted to see. In the myth of the moon Aninga it is told that this spirit was originally a blind boy who was confined in the igloo of his (grand)mother. He gained clear sight by immersion in a lake and travelled far from home and became a great hunter. Nuliajuk, the inua of the sea and the mother of life, on the other side, ultimately became a blinded and crippled being. The practice of shamanism Although the ideology of shamanism was centered on the theme of the great journeys to the land of the inuat of the sea and the moon and the procuring of game, the actual practice of shamanism was mainly dominated by healing practices. Hall already distinguished between activities of the angakkoq on behalf of the sick and activities of the angakkut on behalf of the community in general (Hall 1864: 318). The healing of illness did not require the participation of the whole group and was much more an affair of the angakkoq, the patient and his near kin. Mauss and Beuchat have demonstrated how important this opposition of individual and community was in Inuit life. They relate this opposition to seasonal variations in Inuit life. In summer life was dominated by individualistic and asocial principles, in winter by collective and social principles (Mauss and Beuchat 1966: 470-5). Winter was the period of the great ritual feasts. We do not know much about the functions of the angakkut in these great ritual feasts. In the descriptions of these feasts by Hall ( 1 864: 222-223), Boas (1888: 603-609; 1 90 1 : 1 38- 142); and Rasmussen ( 1 930: 226) the angakkut played an important part. Themes of transvestilism as noted by Hall and ritual sexual intercourse as recorded by Boas are prominent. Just as in the seances for the procuring of game the angakkut always seem to have been men. We find no indications that the angakkut who performed in the great ritual feasts were women. Therefore it seems probable that the performance in the great feasts and seances for the procuring of game was a man's affair in the practice of Inuit religion. It is interesting to notice however that the female angakkoq Uvavnuk procured game for the Inuit while at her deathbed (Rasmussen 1929: 123). When the great ritual feasts declined, healing seances dominated the practice of shamanism. The diary of Matthiassen gives a very interesting account of the shamanistic activities on the island of Southampton in the winter of 1922-1923. Shamanistic activities were continuously going on and interwoven with the daily practice of life. 92/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="11">Seances were mainly led by the most important angakkoq (Angutingmarik), but sometimes other angakkut participated or did a seance of their own (Rasmussen 1930: 100-112). Men and women could perform in different shamanistic activities, but the technique of qilaneq or qilaq was considered to be a speciality for women. This was a technique of consulting the spirits by lifting an object by means of the belt of the qilajuq (a stone, head or leg of the consultant, or the leg of the qilajuq). The qilajuq pulled softly and could feel by the heaviness of the object whether the answer to his question was affirmative or negative. Women could also be active in other shamanistic activities. They participated in the exorcism of spirits, among the Netsilik (Rasmussen 1931: 298). Just as men they could participate in incidental shamanistic activities and often used every opportunity to demonstrate their shamanistic powers. Everyday life was interwoven with shamanistic activities. In a world that was conceptualised in animistic terms everything unusual was interpreted in terms of willful actions of men and spirits. The angakkoq could perceive the true causes of things and in that way he could give meaning to events that would otherwise have remained inexplicable (Balikci 1970: 238). Balikci, it would seem, rightly stresses this aspect as one of the most important functions of Inuit shamanism. The continuous activities of the angakkut, which gave a religious perspective to daily life, were even more important since the ritual feasts were no longer being celebrated. The angakkut gave meaning to illness and hunger, sickness and death, but also to abundance of game and other fortunate events . It is clear that the efficiency of shamanism was to a large extent based on the ability of the angakkut to give meaning to everything that happened. We have many descriptions of shamanistic seances among the Inuit. Although the angakkut were in charge of the seances other participants had considerable influence on its course. Much interaction existed between the angakkut and other participants during seances and it is quite clear that the success of the seances depended to a large extent on the social skill of the angakkut. A seance usually aroused strong emotional reactions among the participants that had to be guided into the right direction by the angakkoq. His control over the seance was increased by a strong social position. The social position of the angakkut There was much difference in status among the angakkut. Some were highly praised while others did not have much prestige and were sometimes even ridiculed. Some angakkut were not only respected, but also feared and suspected of witchcraft. The techniques of witchcraft were commonly known, as were the techniques of shamanism. The angakkoq was the magical specialist par excellence and therefore he was always liable to be accused of witchcraft. This could mean an important check to his influence. If someone was considered a witch he was avoided as much as possible, isolated, and could even be killed. The prestige of an angakkoq could depend on many factors such as his control over his THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /93</page><page sequence="12">helping spirits, his success in the treatment of his patients. Most important was probably his skill in the manipulation of group processes and his ability to coordinate and integrate emotional and cognitive tensions within the total cognitive framework of Inuit culture. The status of an angakkoq did not only depend on his qualities as an angakkoq. General factors which determined the status of all Inuit like his qualities as a hunter or his number of children contributed to his status. In a local group more angakkut were usually present. They could act together or individually depending on the circumstances. In the diary of Therkel Matthiassen most seances are performed by the angakkoq Angutingmarik. Sometimes other angakkut were active but in most seances Angutingmarik took the lead. An informal hierarchy probably existed among the angakkut. An angakkoq could have much influence in Inuit society because he spoke with superior knowledge. He could perceive things that were hidden to other Inuit. This superior knowledge enabled him to express judgments on the causes of things. Therkel Matthiassen was told several times that his "digging in the earth" was a cause of illness. In this way the responsibility for a particular illness or another misfortune could be directed to a particular person. Most Inuit probably disagreed with Matthiassen' s archaeological activities but the angakkoq was the most suitable person to give judgment because he could speak on behalf of the spirits. It is clear that this position gave much responsibility and power to an angakkoq. The boundary between his own interests and the interests of the whole community were not always clear and this offered the angakkoq ample space for manipulation to enlargen his prestige and power or pursue his own interests. Examples are given in ethnographic literature of angakkut who tried to use their magical powers to pursue their own interests. Hall already mentions the case of an angakkoq who tried to force a woman to sleep with him (Hall 1864: 320) and many other examples could be added. These attempts to increase his power could endanger and weaken the position of an angakkoq. The Inuit are very sensitive to any attempt to dominate other people. It is considered intolerate to put undue pressure on another person (cf. Briggs , among others) . The Inuit would immediately be aware if an angakkoq tried to pursue his own interests under the guise of communal interests. Many reactions are possible; for example they could flatly refuse his instructions, they could consult another angakkoq, they could accuse him of witchcraft, they could leave the village. In all cases the prestige of an angakkoq would suffer and he would risk the loss of his influence. Whether the instructions of an angakkoq would be followed or not depended partly on the integrity of the man. The Inuit knew the rules of the game and they could easily see whether the angakkut played fair or not. It also depended on the social position of the angakkoq. If he was a leading person in the community, an ihumatar , ( isumataq ) it was more probable they would follow his instructions even if they mistrusted his motives. We see different categories of people acting as angakkut. Influential people like the isumataq could practice as angakkut (Aua, Angutingmarik etc.). At the other hand we also see that marginal people (foreigners like Anarqaq, a poor hunter like Unaleq, etc.) were angakkut. Finally women could be angakkut. This difference between influential angakkut on one side and angakkut that had little or no influence in social life on the other was already noticed by Hultkrantz (cf. Hultkrantz 1962: 397-8). 94/J.G. OOSTEN</page><page sequence="13">For influential men like Aua and Angutingmarik their function as angakkut offered scope to increase their control over other Inuit. For others, such as poor hunters or foreigners, their practice as angakkut offered an additional means of subsistence which they badly needed. Both types may have had different reasons to practice as angakkut but to the practice of shamanism itself it made no difference. We have no indications that there was a difference in ideologies, types of helping spirits, moral attitude, etc. , corresponding to angakkut of these two types. It may be that the technique of qilaneq as a female speciality implied a different ideology but we do not have sufficient data for this to be ascertained. As matters stand now we must conclude that the shamanistic complex among the Inuit offered scope to influential people on one side and poor hunters, foreigners and women on the other. Although both men and women could practice as angakkut it seems probable that the procuring of game was essentially a task for male angakkut. It is also probable that the performance at the great ritual feasts was restricted to male angakkut. The whole social pattern of Inuit society was reflected in the shamanistic complex. Among the Buryat shamanism was particularly related to women and younger brothers (Hamayon 1978: 38), but this seems not to have been the case among the Inuit. Aspects of both central and peripheral possession cults were therefore present in the shamanistic complex. At the same time it is clear that this pertained only to the social structure of the shamanistic complex. In other respects (kinds of spirits involved, moral attitude, etc.) the distinction between central and peripheral possession cults was not relevant to Inuit culture. Conclusions The shamanistic complex among the Inuit cannot be considered as a simple homogeneous phenomenon. There was clearly much differentiation in its structure. It is difficult to reconstruct this structure, since most ethnographers did not try to describe the internal differentiation of the shamanistic complex. However, some conclusions can still be made. a) The angakkut were not office holders. They were religious specialists. b) Different categories of people could become shamans (men and women, influential people and marginal people). c) The ideology of the shamanistic complex reflected male ideals and virtues. It is improbable that female angakkut played an important part in seances and rituals that were directed towards the procuring of game. d) The technique of qilaneq on the other hand was probably an important speciality for female angakkut. It did not develop into a peripheral possession cult in the sense this term is coined by Lewis. Male and female domains in shamanism did therefore not coincide. e) Among the angakkut both marginal and influential people could be found. The shamanistic complex offered scope to both categories and this did not result in a THE SHAMANISTIC COMPLEX /95</page><page sequence="14">differentiation in a central or a peripheral possession cult. It is clear however that the social position of the angakkut had great influence on their possibilities to control other Inuit in the course of their shamanistic activities. f) Although the spirits in Inuit culture were amoral they did sustain the moral order of the world in an indirect way since they punished transgressions of ritual injunctions. The qualification ' 'main morality religion" is, nevertheless, hardly appropriate in relation to Inuit religion when we consider the structural antagonisms between the angakkut and the spirits. g) Inuit shamanism cannot be classified unambiguously as either a central or a peripheral possession cult. The distinction of peripheral and central is, nevertheless, relevant in relation to the social organisation of shamanism among the Inuit (influential angakkut vs. marginal angakkut, male vs. female). h) Witchcraft and shamanism were closely connected. Both implied the use of magical techniques that were commonly known. A shaman was always liable to be accused of witchcraft since he was an acknowledged specialist in magical techniques. This relationship, between witchcraft and shamanism may have been a check to any abuse of power by the angakkut. REFERENCES ARDENER E. 1977: "Belief and the Problem of Women.
