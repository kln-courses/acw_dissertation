<plain_text><page sequence="1">News &amp; Notes Destruction caused by hurricane Isidore MEXICO CITY (The News). The 86 municipalities in Yucatan and 11 in Campeche were declared disaster areas by the Mexican government after Hurricane Isidore (with 205 kph/125 mph winds) devastated the Yucatan peninsula on September 21 and 22, 2002. After causing flooding in Cuba, the hurricane skirted the Yucatan coast, then veered inland. The storm caused heavy rains across southern Mexico and northern Central America. Authorities said the storm left 300,000 homeless before drifting back into the Gulf of Mexico, where it headed north and threatened Louisiana and Mississippi. Hurricane Isi dore's passage through the Mexican southeast left a score of people dead, ripping roofs from homes, flooding streets, and tossing trees onto the Colonial boulevards of the Yucatan capital, Merida. It also did tremendous damage to agricul ture, the main source of employment in the region. Areas affected by the hurricane will remain under a health emer gency to prevent outbreaks of dengue fever, malaria and gastrointestinal disease. Yucatan was the Mexican state hardest hit by the storm. The damage caused by Isidore has been so great that the state will need at least two years to fully recover. The storm damaged some 100,000 homes, caused losses to half a million people and destroyed the state's agriculture. The hurricane razed about 60 percent of the state's poultry farms, also causing hog production to shrink by 50 percent which, along with the cultivation of henequen. Isidore killed 8.2 million live stock and flattened 95,000 hectares (about 234,600 acres) of crops and damaged infrastructure in Merida, the capital of the state, which is also a World Heritage Site. However, the Yucatan peninsula's Maya ruins, delicate na ture reserves and intricate ecosystems appeared to have sur vived the devastation of Hurricane Isidore - in some cases fairing better than modern structures, which were uprooted, levelled or washed away. Archaeologists fanned out for emergency inspections of hundreds of Maya ruins. While their assessments were only preliminary, they were en couraged by what they found. For exemple,in the the Maya cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal there was no damage beyond some trees blown down, and at Oxkintok pyramid and surrounding site had withstood the storm. According to Araceli Dominguez, director of Grupo Gena, an environ mental organization based in the resort city of Cancun, most of the plants and animals in nature reserves across the penin sula held up as well as the Celestun's flamingos. Perhaps the worst damage to the ecosystem is the hundreds of trees affected, because these are vital for the cities in this climate. Discoveries at Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the Moon TEMPE (ASU). An unexpected set of new discoveries in the ongoing excavation beneath the Pyramid of the Moon at Teotihuacan may provide critical clues in reconstructing the history of the large Precolumbian urban centre located 25 miles from current Mexico City.

The texts give no hint that the two brothers were enemies, as once thought by scholars. The stairway's east section tells the next chapter in the story. When the king was in his 20's, the other superpower, Calakmul, attacked and defeated Dos Pilas. This was a major surprise because it had not previously been established that Calakmul actually invaded and defeated Dos Pilas. Although the young king fled the city, it seems that he returned and was installed on the Dos Pilas throne as a "puppet king," control led by Calakmul. Now the king displayed his loyalty to Calakmul by undertaking a decade-long war against Tikal. Balaj Chan K'awiil's forces sacked Tikal and captured its ruler, his own brother, to be sacrificed. This part of the story is laid out on the west section of the staircase, and the details are graphic. The inscriptions on the steps report that after the Dos Pilas victory over Tikal, "Blood flowed and skulls of the 13 peoples of the Tikal place were piled up." Then the glyphs record that late in his life, the Dos Pilas king did a "victory dance" with Calakmul's king, his ally. The inscrip tion on that final step ended with a domestic note, the ruler recording the name of his wife, Ix Itzan Ajaw, and their child, his heir. Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt's Institute of Meso american Archaeology, who organized the new glyph re search and other scholars said the translations supported a concept advanced by two Maya scholars, Simon Martin of University College, London, and Nikolai Grube of the Uni versity of Bonn. They contend that the turmoil of the seventh and eighth centuries resulted from the contest between the Tikal and Calakmul superpowers, along with their blocs of allied city-states, for complete dominance. After Tikal was sacked, it eventually roared back and crushed Calakmul. And then the Maya world just broke up into regional powers, setting the stage for a period of intensive, petty warfare that finally led to the collapse of the Maya. Dos Pilas itself was abandoned in 760. According to Arthur Demarest it now appears that Dos Pilas was a pawn in a much bigger battle. Relocating Chocoha FORT WORTH (Thomas H. Guderjan, William Bedford, and Tim Preston). The Maya site of Chocoha was first reported by the French explorer, Maurice de Perigny (1908). Its location had been ambiguous until July, 2002.

Location of Chocoha. survey efforts of the Maya Research Program's efforts at the site of Blue Creek in northern Belize (see Guderjan and Lichtenstein 2002), Chocoha, Blue Creek's nearest neighbor to the north, was relocated and partially mapped. Our goals were to determine the nature of Blue Creek's northern neighbors. For a decade, we have conducted survey efforts within Belize and clearly understand Blue Creek's neighbors and the geopolitical setting on the southern side of the Belize Mexico border. However, this is the first time we have held a permit to survey north of the Rio Hondo in Mexico. The Rio Hondo reaches the La Lucha uplands and the Bravo Escarp ment near the Mexican village of La Union. A short distance upstream, the Rio Hondo becomes too shallow to navigate. As Guderjan has consistently understood the site of Blue Creek to have controlled the terminus of riverine trade on the Hondo, this also presented the opportunity to test that asser tion. Chocoha was known to be in the general vicinity of the village of La Union along the Mexico- Belize border at the headwaters of the Rio Hondo (Fig. 1). De Perigny located Chocoha approximately 1 kilometer from an aguada known as Agua Caliente. Additionally, he published a sketch map and noted that traces of a summit temple still remained on top of one of the principal buildings (1908:72). Additionally, de Chocoha Quintana Roo, Mexico Group A Mapped by T. Guderjan, W. Bedford, T. Preston July 2002 with permission of INAH and Sr. Juventud Ramon, La union, Q.R.

Perigny notes a secondary set of building 600 meters south of the principal one (1908). Aside from de Perigny's report, Chocoha also appears on the Middle American Research Institute's map of sites in the Maya area (MARI 1941), the archaeological atlas of Quintana Roo (Muller 1959) and at least one commercial map (International Travel Map Produc tions 1993). The source of the locational information for the MARI map is vague and appears to be an approximation from de Perigny's report. But clearly, the MARI map is the source for both more recent maps. In general, de Perigny's report is in concert with the site we mapped near La Union. Our map of Group A (Figs. 2 and 3), in particular, the platform on which Structure 1 sits, appears to be the same group mapped by de Perigny. The site is approximately one kilometre from a cenote, presumably the same one known by de Perigny as Agua Caliente. The owner of the property informs us that prior to looting activi Vol. XXIV • Oktober 2002</page><page sequence="4">150 145 STR 2 \ f N. " V \ vtuom / \ 140 PLATFORM 135 / ' STR 3 \ 130 " Fig. 3.

This also matches de Perigny's description of the Chocoha. Conse quently, while some doubt will always exist, we believe that this site is de Perigny's Chocoha. Chocoha's core area has an unusual configuration with two large temples on separate platforms, facing different directions. Structure 1 is approximately 10 meters tall and faces west. It rests atop a platform that is approximately 5 meters tall. There are two looters ' trenches in Structure 1, one of which apparently destroyed the summit room. However, we have no temporal information regarding Structure 1 at all. Approximately 30 meters to the north is another large platform, approximately 7 meters tall. On top of this platform is the slightly taller, approximately 11 meters, Structure 2. (Structure 2 faces south and there are several small structures on the perimeter of its platform. We believe, by the way, that this platform is what was sketched by de Perigny.) There is also one looters' trench dug into the east side of Structure 2, exposing apparently Early Classic masonry covered with red paint, part of which still remains. Other than this assessment of this masonry style, we also have no temporal information regarding Structure 2. £ I) ^ '-'I 1,5m tall Chocoha Quintana Roo, Mexico Group B 2.5m tall Gpg 3 Vi: _North | Magnetic 10 meters „ E 298-8887 N 19-84-332 Fig. 4. Planview of Group B. Approximately 200 meters south of Structure 1 is a courtyard group, Group B, which may have functioned as the major elite residence at the site (Fig. 4). This consists of a roughly rectangular arrangement of five buildings on top of a hilltop platform. The largest building is Structure B-1 which would have been a vaulted structure on a large sub-structure, the ruins of which are now approximately 2.5 meters tall. Importantly, at least for our goals, Chocoha appears to be the only site in the area with monumental architecture south of the 18th parallel near the Rio Hondo. Another site, Las Palmas, is also south of the 18th parallel but lies further west. In addition, Chocoha is a considerable distance from the Rio Hondo and not in a position to control prehistoric trade on the river. Consequently, our survey supports Guderjan's asser tion that Blue Creek controlled riverine trade at the terminus of the Rio Hondo. Equally importantly, de Perigny's Chocoha is an unusual site in an unusual setting. It clearly had nothing to do with riverine traffic, but controlled significant agricultural re sources in the small bajos around it. There is a large, low lying area about 5 kilometres east of the site dotted with small lagoon that may have provided resources to Chocoha. How ever, it more likely was dependent upon more local resources.

Maya murals and graffiti at Kinal, Peten, Guatemala GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). The extensive Maya ruins of Kinal are located within the Rio Azul National Park in the Reserva de la Biosfera Maya in the north-eastern part of the Guatema lan Department of Peten, in the Rio Ixcan Basin, close to the well-known ancient Maya city of Rio Azul. The site, discov ered in 1957, encompasses a large acropolis with 13 interior patios, many vaulted structures, and aballcourt. An important and surprising aspect is, that in spite of its large size, no carved stelae or other monumental sculptures were found at Kinal. Concerning architectural decorations only a three-dimen sional anthropomorphic stucco head and torso, a single painted design, and various graffiti of differing quality have previ ously been reported and published from Kinal. Robert Klaus (1962: 12) published a painting, represent ing an unusual footprint, a rather rare design in comparison to 89 Vol. XXIV • Oktober 2002</page><page sequence="5">90 Fig. 5. Two Red handprints and graffito at Kinal. (Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer, 2001). the frequently occurring handprints in red and other colors in the interiors and exteriors of Maya masonry buildings and inside caves. Ian Graham (1967, Fig. 26) published an interesting graffito from the interior of Structure 39 portraying two fragmentary anthropomorphic figures in side view, accompa nied by a hieroglyphic compound. This graffito is in an elegant, presumably Late Classic style and has been inter preted as a unique erotic scene. Recent excavations in Structure 36 revealed in a room eleven graffiti and in another room two graffiti, representing anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, human heads and unidentifiable designs, all in a very crude and simple style (Gutiérrez 1992, Figs. 1-10). In 2001, architect Oscar Quintana Samayoa, of the Gua temalan Instituto de Antropologi'a e Historia (IDAEH), guided an international group to inspect various Maya archaeolo gical sites in the Eastern Peten. During a brief visit to Kinal several interiors of vaulted structures were inspected and in one interior room a graffito and two red-coloured handprints were photographed that obviously have hitherto not been reported. The mural decorations were recorded under ex tremely difficult conditions within a badly collapsed and very narrow room and therefore it was almost impossible to take frontal photographs with flash. The observed graffito is executed on a white stucco cover which is in a fragmentary condition with many missing, fallen off portions (Figs. 5,6). The best preserved section partially depicts a human head in profile, facing to the left, showing an obviously male person age with elongated head, open mouth, and a distinct mustache; there are several curved and straight incised lines underneath this head, which measures more than 20 cm in height. The head resembles very closely the right-hand graffito head in profile published by Ian Graham. Close and beneath the graffito head are two not very distinct small red handprints and a few incomprehensible lines in red. The handprints are the first ones of this common mural decoration design re ported from Kinal. Chronologically, the fragmentary graffito as well as the two handprints may be attributed to the Late Classic period. Red handprints in the Guatemalan Peten are not frequently found but were reported in architectural con text at other archaeological sites, for example at Tikal, Yaxha, and San Clemente. The photograph is published here with the kind permis sion of the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropologfa e Historia, Ministerio de Cultura y Déportés.

A comprehensive restoration program for the Casa de la Cacica de Teposcolula began December 2001. After many years of utter neglect, this unique monument of Mixtec architecture is finally receiving due attention. The house, built by the Mixtec lord Felipe Osorio during the mid-sixteenth century, combines Prehispanic building tecniques and decoration with Spanish architectural loans.

The main wing, west of the sunken patio, is remarkable for the decorative frieze surrounding the building at roof level, very similar to the friezes seen in contemporary pictographic documents. The north wing, heavily deteriorated, was com pletely built according to the Prehispanic architectural tradi tion. After a detailed study, it was recently decided that enough evidence is available to restore, and where necessary reconstruct, both wings to their original state. The remaining wings will only be consolidated. Also still standing is a sixteenth-century hospital, featuring similar Mixtec architec ture.

On August 13,2002, the K'ichee' linguist and author Florentino Ajapacajâ Tum was killed in a traffic accident in Nahuala, Solola, Guatemala. Don Florentino was born in 1935 in Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan, Solola and grew up in his home village, where he became member of acofradi'a and one of the leading intellectuals of his community. In the 1970s, Don Floren tino took classes in Maya linguistics that were taught by William M. Norman, Kenneth Hale, Terrence Kaufman and Nora C. England. In 1979 he received a diploma as a linguist from the Proyecto Lingüfstico Francisco Marroqufn. He translated the "Misai Dominical y Festivo" into K'ichee' and is the author of K'ichee' Choltziij, the first monolingual dictionary of a Mayan language with more than 27,000 entries (Cholsamaj 2001), as well as Tz'onob'al Tziij, a book on K'ichee' ceremonial discourse (Cholsamaj 2001). He is co-author of a bilingual K'ichee' dictionary (Proyecto Lin güfstico Francisco Marroqufn 1996) and at the time of his death was in the process of compiling another major K' ichee'— Spanish dictionary. Don Florentino participated in many congresses and meetings and was without doubt the leading K'ichee' linguist of his generation. In addition to his linguis tic research, Don Florentino also served in the Consejo de Ancianos pa tinamit Siija' Xankata'. His death is a tragic loss for Maya linguistics, the Maya community of Guatemala, for his native village as well as for his large family. W-?:' W&amp;m -"k* ip -3^m r .* iii&amp;pi Fig. 1.
