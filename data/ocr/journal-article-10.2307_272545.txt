<plain_text><page sequence="1">By OSSIP K. FLECHTHEIM History and Theodicy Some critical remarks on the theories of history of Hegel and Marx PART II HEGEL'S metaphysics constitutes a departure in a secular direction from earlier theological systems.39 As compared with Marx, however, Hegel's philosophy is of a theological character, and Marx's system40 is a much larger step along the way towards the secularization of occidental thought. Yet, since the times of Marx it has become clear how much even Marx's imposing system is still pervaded by metaphysical and theological traits. As this article will try to show, Marx's Weltanschauung is still a system of optimism and harmonism. This is true of his general conception of man and reality as well as of his ideas of history and progress. In the center of Marx's system we find a philosophy of man (today one would say: a philosophical anthropology) which proceeds largely on an irra- tional (emotional) basis. This philosophy of man differs widely from mere description of empirically found material; it transcends even the interpretation of phenomena in terms of cause and effect, found so usually in American studies in sociology. It is, in fact, an attempt to locate man cosmically in history. Paradoxical as it may appear at first sight, Marx always was as much and perhaps even more than Hegel the philosopher of the "Objective Mind" -to use Hegel's terminology. Human society and history are the central ideas of his peculiar form of humanism which does not deny the existence of nature, yet places it in the shadowy realms of half-reality, conceives of 39My first article tried to set forth the har- erable changes during the second half of the monistic and organistic features of his phil- century.

Marx's concept of reality is, to be sure, no longer in the realm of Hegel's abstract, speculative and spiritualistic categories. Just as little is it, however, the empirical factuality of positivistically inclined social science, or the realistically interpreted objectivity of classical natural science. Nor can it, after all, be reduced to what nineteenth century ma- terialism understood as "matter." In Marx's opinion all these concep- tions are not more than "ideologies" mirroring and transfiguring the everyday "common sense" mentality of bourgeois society. Marx was "materialist" only in a rather peculiar sense. His special brand of "historical" and "dialectical materialism" will become more understandable by an investigation of the relation of history and society on the one hand, nature on the other. To start with, one has to keep in mind that the complex "nature" has in Marx's system at least two different meanings and functions. First there is as an abstraction that may be called "nature as such" apart from human history and society. It is true, as a systematic theorist and practical politician Marx was never much interested in nature as such; this theme he left to Engels, Kautsky and Lenin to develop. Nevertheless nature in this sense appears in occasional remarks in Marx's own writings and is present all the time in his system even if not in a pivotal position. He stresses that nature in this sense is the ultimate "basis"'4 of all production and society. In relation to nature in this sense Marx's materialism is similar to that of the traditional variety. In sharp contrast to Hegel, for whom the whole universe - nature as well as society and mind - was nothing but one continuous process of the growing self-consciousness and self-liberation of the "Absolute Mind," for Marx nature here was essentially a world of blind necessity and chance, a dead mechanism, a sum-total of events and causes which man may at best explain and influence, but never completely control and master. Nature so seen is infinite and boundless, abundant in opposition and struggle, full of impediments and catastrophes. Here, order is only the by-product of chaos. But Marx discovers in nature a second much more important aspect. Since nature brought forth man it has now the cardinal function of per- manently serving as handmaid and nurse of human society and history. To speak in Hegel's terms, it is now a mediated (aufgehobener) factor in the historical evolution of the human race. Nature is no longer blind and cruel, senseless and dead. With the genesis and ascent of mankind nature "Marx, Capital, ed. Untermann, Volume III, Chicago, 1909, p. 955. 47</page><page sequence="3">PHYLON itself has become a precondition, a first step, a promise of all the harmony and liberty, the freedom and meaning of fulfilled humanity. Since nature in the first sense surrounds history and society as a kind of last frame of reference and serves thus as a last substructure, social history is - in Marx's view - not entirely complete and sufficient in itself. Vertically (i. e. considered at a given moment without regard to the time development) society is dependent upon nature. Even horizontally (i.e. seen in the dimension of time) history is invaded by nature insofar as both of its ends fade into the dawn and dusk of the planet: At the beginning, in the age of the apes evolving into man, history disappears into prehuman nature; at the end it will perish in cosmic catastrophes and destruction. The eternal and infinite world of nature is, however, only the background from which there emerges in clear relief as central structure the world of human history and society with nature as a subordinated and integrated element. However pessimistic and godless Marx was with respect to nature as such, he was as optimistic and "godly" with reference to the history of man. He is indeed distinguished from Aristotle, Leibniz, Hegel, and all the other optimistic idealists in that his conception of nature and with it of the universe as a whole does not constitute a structured totality which would culminate in God (similar to the Aristotelian "energeia," to Leib- niz's "central monad," or to Hegel's "Absolute Mind.") Nature is "with- out gods." Yet, Marx's atheism is by no means absolute, since it definitely includes the positing of a "god" in history. God is, of course, not to be understood in this context as an anthropomorphic being analogous to the god of primitive Jewish or Christian religion. This is true of Marx as of Hegel, Leibniz, or even Aristotle. For Marx, as for Hegel, history has a structure that is not purely naturalistic, materialistic and immanent, but instead spiritualistic, dialectic, and transcendent. History has here a spa- tially conceived unity, like a rounded and completed circle or a spiral. It is for him the unique and uniform process of mankind and its society. In Marx's "organic universalistic" view history definitely is an "organic whole,"42 a structured totality. And this is true not only for the individual "epochs" ("types of production"), into which universal history is divided, but also for this universal history itself (as "the economic formation of society," as "the social process of production.")43 Marx himself quotes with approval, in another context, a Russian reviewer who praises him for the "disclosure of the special laws that regulate the origin, existence, de- velopment, and death of a given social organism."4 'Karl MTarx, Zur Kritik der Politischen Vol. I, New York, p. 357.

It is here not our concern to discuss how much this Aristotelian immanent teleology in turn goes back through Plato to primitive forms of thought. At any rate, the category which is most important for Marx's conception of history was taken from biology and not from mechanics. Thus history like an organism exhibits an inner telos. Its whole process is pervaded by a tendency and aim, a meaning - however immanent - which cannot be explained in terms of specific instances and their casual connection. Time is, in this conception, understood as moving forward, giving direction and attaining fulfilment. Mankind itself - following Marx's world-historical perspective - enters its history as a mute animal species of homo sapiens. But in the course of its history it severs itself more and more from the chains of nature and acquires progressively control over circumstances; it changes the social and natural play of chance more and more into consciously formed necessity; it constructs out of the raw material of natural determination the mighty edifice of its socio-historical creations of culture. "Just as the savage must wrestle with nature in order to satisfy his wants, in order to maintain his life and reproduce it, so civilized man has to do it and he must do it in all forms of society and under all possible modes of production. The realm of freedom . . lies beyond the sphere of material production, in the strict meaning of the term."45 "The true realm of freedom which, however, can flourish only upon that realm of necessity as its basis,"4" begins only beyond this realm of necessity. Freedom grows for Marx, as well as for Hegel, out of that necessity which is understood and desired by man in the historical process of mankind's self-loss and self-conquest. Yet we find here one of the important differences between the "ma- terialist" Marx and the "idealist" Hegel. Hegel conceives of the whole development of the universe and of mankind as of one great process of self-elevation and liberation; he pretends in a truly Christian manner that the individual himself may become one with the "Absolute Mind" (God) and participate in his eternal life and absolute knowledge. Marx, on the contrary, is much more modest and sober than Hegel. He assumes materialistically that there is no eternal life and no absolute knowledge for the individual. Quite in the sense of the ancient traditions he is satis- fied to attribute to the individual a limited amount of liberty, life and happiness. Marx simply overlooks the tragic aspects of human existence (temporal and spatial limitations, inadequacy of end and realization, 4"Marx, Capital, Vol. III, p. 954. "Ibid., p. 954 f. 49</page><page sequence="5">PHYLON decay and death, etc.) like any optimist. There is, then, a notable hiatus in Marx's metaphysics. Human history is for Marx, perhaps still more genuinely than for Hegel, the story of an everlasting, even if from time to time interrupted, true progress in the "humanization" of mankind. The "old doctrine of progress . . . the animating and controlling idea of western civilization (even if it should ultimately prove to be no more than an idolum saeculi)"47 still has Marx in its grip and determines his theoretical and practical atti- tude to history.48 It is true that Marx's immense knowledge of historical facts prevented him from committing any of the simplifications and exag- gerations of the tritest prophets of progress of the nineteenth century. Yet it is a simplification and exaggeration to pretend that Marx recognized the delusive character of that so-called historical evolution according to which "the last stage regards the preceding stages as only preliminary to itself, and, therefore can only look at them one-sidedly."49 One has only to compare this last passage quoted by Korsch from Marx's Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy in the general context of the Intro- duction with the following passages which although isolated and frag- mentary notes yet illustrate Marx's belief in the importance of economic progress. "The civic society is the most developed and manifold organiza- tion of production50; ... an industrial people possesses the height of its production at the moment, at which it occupies its historical height";51 "this conception appears as a necessary development. But justification (of a theory allowing for the element) of chance.... On the whole the concept of progress to be understood otherwise than in the usual abstract way."52 Moreover the Introduction is much more empirical and realistic and less doctrinaire than the Communist Manifesto on the one hand or the Critique of the Gotha Programme on the other. Still the fact - later to be explained - remains that faith in historical progress is one of the cardinal points of Marx's whole conception of history without which the entire edifice would collapse.5 Korsch quotes Marx's interpretation of the different types of production as "so many epochs in the progress of the economic formation of society."54 And if still further proof is neces- sary it will suffice to quote Engels' famous remarks about the "introduction 47J.

Only the pure "abstract ideological" spheres of religion, art, philosophy, etc., which are far removed from the economic core, give room to the play of chance.58 What Marx states with reference to a specific social order is true as well of the economic basis of history as a whole: "When a society has discov- ered the natural laws which regulate its own movement ... it can neither overleap the natural phases of evolution nor shuffle them out of the world by decrees.""59 In the same preface to the first edition of Capital Marx says: "I conceive the development of the economic structure of society to be a natural process.""60 And, finally, he refers to the following remarks of his Russian critic Sieber: "Consequently, Marx troubles himself about one thing only: to demonstrate, by means of exact scientific study, the necessity of definite and orderly successions in social relations ... For this purpose, it is quite enough that, when demonstrating the necessity of the present order of society, he should simultaneously demonstrate the neces- sity of a different order into which the present order must inevitably pass, no matter whether they are aware of it or unaware of it. Marx regards the social movement as a natural process guided by laws which are not merely independent of the will, the consciousness, and the purposes of men, but, conversely determine their will, their consciousness and their purposes ...." Marx's conception of history as a uniform evolution of mankind, in the course of which social progress is realized, determines the way in which Marx conceives of the sub-division and structure of history. Here different viewpoints and principles yield a wealth of structural division and se- quences of epochs; which is, however, subject to the cardinal conception of the development of the human species toward the harmony of a classless society.

At the start and end of this development are posited the marginal notions of abso- lute statics and absolute dynamics, which constitute the ultimate "ma- terialistic" basis for the development from the "prehistory" of mankind to its history; that is, for the slow and "painful" transformation of the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom. (Necessity and freedom are again marginal notions and the process described by them implies par excellence a qualitative change or 'sports'). Inherent in these two encompassing and relatively straightforward lines of development, we find the more complicated and contradictory structure of the specifically socio-economic, sociological and political configurations. Human society has to pass in three dialectical stages through the great developments of (1) primitive, classless society over (2) the class-civilization towards a (3) civilized classless society. Of these the epoch of class-civilization is again divided into the four eras of Asiatic Society, Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and Capitalism, all of which again have quite different functions as far as the possible attainment of the classless society of tomorrow is con- cerned. In this scheme the key position, the jumping-off-place is, of course, occupied by bourgeois society, which is already "socialized" in the tech- nological aspects of its production-system, but which reduces the class struggle to two antagonistic forces and makes the proletariat - to use Hegel's terms - the new "bondsman" as against the old "lord" (bour- geoisie). But the most imposing cleavage of all time and space runs between capitalism and socialism. This is the moment when time has "fulfilled" itself, when the "Logos" embraces the "Kairos," when the proletariat "grasps the opportunity" and makes the great "leap," when the "dictator- ship of the proletariat" inaugurates the transition to socialism and to classless society. Contrasting with the process of liberation from the fetters of nature, Marx perceived a concomitant enslavement of man by society resulting in alienation and dehumanization. Mankind loses in its social relations, which for Marx characterize mankind directly, its natural originality, happiness and spontaneity during the course of its history, which Marx, therefore, devaluates into "prehistory." And at the end of its "prehistory" mankind has dehumanized itself to that state, which Hegel characterizes so strik- ingly as geistiges Tierreich. Yet in Marx's dialectical system this process does not appear at all purely negative. It is positive, in so far as it con- tains potentially all preconditions for changing again into the opposite. And this is true owing to the fact that thesis and antithesis of freedom and constraint, of emancipation and enslavement, have crystallized and become clearly opposed to each other in the course of this process. In this way, 53</page><page sequence="9">PHYLON Marx perceives a growing simplification of social differentiation that per- vades the history of class societies and class struggles, whose result is in the end that only two classes oppose each other in capitalism. Marx's historic-philosophical interpretation of the nature and function of both bourgeoisie and proletariat is a masterpiece of Hegelian dialectic. The proletariat appears to undergo the maximum of violation, dehumani- zation and impersonalization. All past history has worked in order to concentrate in the proletariat the whole "mass of poverty, oppression, enslavement, degeneration and exploitation.""6 The proletariat already contains, however, its antithesis, its own Aufhebung. Through its class consciousness it recognizes its own enslavement and that its task is to free itself at the same time. As such it is the "working class - a class which grows ever more numerous and is disciplined, unified and organized by the very mechanism of the capitalist method of production.""3 It can at any time break its chains and resurrect itself, like a phoenix out of the ashes, enhanced, purified and rejuvenated out of the deepest degradation, as that class which has become mankind. In contrast to the proletariat, which personifies through its process of emancipation the dialectical turn from negative to positive, it is its op- ponent, the bourgeoisie, which represents the decay from positive to nega- tive. As the ruling class which exploits the proletariat, it enjoys at first all of the material and spiritual advantages of the ongoing progress of technology and the domination of nature. Compared with the proletariat, the bourgeoisie appears mighty, splendid, and free. Closer scrutiny, how- ever, proves this impression to be deceptive. Precisely this class has for- feited socially all the freedom that it has won from nature. Defenseless, it is subject to the blind, natural forces of capitalism; it is still more de- humanized than the proletariat, since it cannot penetrate intellectually its own self-alienation and thus feels itself at home in its own deprivation. The bourgeoisie becomes, in the course of its rule, the incarnation of all backwardness, of all barbarism and impotence. At the end it is for the proletariat to realize what is already latently present: it has to overthrow this giant with feet of clay, this power which is only existing externally but is decadent within. It has to proclaim itself what it is already as a potential force: the new master, who is no longer master but only eman- cipator and redeemer. Thus precisely the deepest dehumanization of the proletariat is the guarantee for its being bound to realize the dialectical change towards highest humanization. It is evident without further explanation that Marx, no less than Hegel, thus conceives of world history as a world-court and a world-stage. Whereas Schiller spoke of the theatre as a stage setting which has the "'Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. I, p. 846. 'Ilbid. 54</page><page sequence="10">HISTORY AND THEODICY meaning of a world, with Marx, the socio-historical world is not much more complicated than a grandios theatre play. It is probably not by chance that Marx himself says, "if I speak of individuals it is only in so far as they are personifications of economic categories, representatives of special class relations and class interests,"64 nor is it by chance that the expression "character-mask" is current in Marxist literature. For Marx "the persons of capitalists and landowners" as well as those of the peasant, the petty bourgeois, and the proletarian are actors on the world stage who have nothing else to do but play their role. They may act well or badly- it will not change the outcome of the play! Indeed, the outcome of Marx's play is from the beginning determined as definitely as the single characters and as the course of the classical drama, where several acts mark different stages in the development of the theme, successively introducing the char- acters and elements of the plot, showing the complications which led to its climax, and finally solving its problem by the so-called catastrophe. In the play of the theatre the dialogue, the story, and the outcome are pre- determined by the author: in Marx's history by- well by whom, if not by "God"? When we deal with Marx's conception of history, we have really to do rather with a kind of modern drama (that has a happy end!) than with a Commedia dell' Arte, in which the players enjoy a certain freedom in their acting! Or, to change the analogy, world history is with Marx a world-court, and again at least the judge knows how the process will end. In this case, it is the proletariat who is judge and executioner at the same time, whereas the bourgeoisie is the defendant on trial. He is, as in Hegel's philosophy of law, the criminal who through his confession passes sentence upon himself which is, then, only to be executed by the proletariat in the name of world history!6" There is not the slightest doubt in Marx's mind that the court of world- history will hand down a just sentence. Yet, this great materialistic revo- lutionist's Weltanschauung is still based throughout on a quite traditional and emotional -and insofar religious! -belief in progress, harmony, and rule of reason. This "wickedly" optimistic faith in the great Harmony and Fulfilment has several main aspects - all closely interrelated and overlapping. As we have seen, there is first the assumption of a deep agree- ment between nature (in the second sense only) and history. There is further the iron conviction of the perfect unison in future society. (This will be discussed at the end of this paper under the motto: Classless Society and the end of "Prehistory"). There is thirdly the presupposition of a "Ibid., p. 864. gericht."

Again the "materialist" in Marx assumes that the matter was the pre- vious, primary, cardinal cause, yet the same Marx believes as much as any idealist that once the spirit has been created by the matter it will remain in a thorough-going, unbroken harmony with it. Speaking of the tasks of mankind as compared with material conditions, Marx makes the following really extraordinary statement: ". . . Mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, we will always find that the task itself arises only when the material conditions necessary for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation."66 How completely is Marx here still the typical child of the eighteenth and nineteenth century and how deeply does he remain in the optimistic and monistic (if not exclusively idealistic) tradition of Hegel and Leibniz, Aristotle and - Socrates. There is, last but not least, extant in Marx the imperturbable faith in the harmonious solution of the specific problems of man's history. Through the "mediation" of the proletariat the barbarity of all previous class society it is to be superseded by the new culture of the classless society and the realm of necessity elevated into the realm of freedom; all past history is justified at least as prehistory and as such finally vindicated. As the pre- condition for future perfection all the sufferings of previous generations have had a deep meaning and legitimacy. "Free-man and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild master and journeyman"67 and to con- clude this enumeration, capitalist and proletarian: they all struggled and suffered ad maiorem gloriam of the emancipated and humanized mankind of the future! Needless to repeat that absolute harmony especially prevails between historical and social evolution and the role of the proletariat (as Marx quite uncritically conceives of this). The socio-historical mechanism needs to work so that the development of the capitalist economy makes the prole- tariat continuously grow in numbers as well as in misery, the class-struggle renders it at the same time more and more class-conscious theoretically and practically. Marx indeed never doubted that the deepest economic misery would coincide with the greatest numerical strength and the highest political maturity and capacity of the proletariat and make it thus invinc- ible. But, paradoxical as it may first appear, there exists even in the last instance profound agreement between the historical evolution of humanity and the destiny of the bourgeoisie (and the other classes - peasants, "Marx, "A Contribution..."

Thus in Marx's philosophy the bourgeoisie (and the other decrepit classes and groups) suffer real tragedy since, owing to the necessary limits of their class-ideology, they do not and cannot under- stand this "cunning" of world-history. Leibniz constructed his theodicy in a thought-world, the world of his monads, which was static in three dimensions; Hegel's world, the world of the "Absolute Mind," although verging in a historical direction, still re- mained for the most part merely spatial - his conception of time was little more than rudimentary. But Marx conceived a truly historical, four- dimensional world in which time is essential and all-pervading. The "pre-established harmony" which belonged naturally enough to Leibniz's theodicean world proved difficult to set even in the very imperfectly his- torical world of Hegel and Hegel failed to overcome all the difficulties of the operation. For Marx, attempting to establish a pre-arranged har- mony in a dynamic, historical world, the difficulties are multiplied a hun- dred-fold.. After all, harmony and optimism appear much more in their place in a thoroughly and openly idealistic and theological system than in Marx's strange hybrid of materialism and idealism. Yet Marx's attempt at a solution does not transcend, at least methodologically, Hegel's pro- cedure and must therefore prove less successful. If Marx indeed has the entire previous human evolution culminate in the victory of the proletariat and discovers the riddle of socio-historical development in the proletarian "Class-Consciousness" and its Marxian "Theory," what is this but Hegel's old scheme of the "World-Spirit" and his "Cunning of Reason"? To facilitate the understanding of this problem with Marx, the reader may be reminded in a few words of the problem in Hegel's philosophy.68 Hegel pretends he has gained complete knowledge of and intellectual con- trol over the process of world-history. He attributes this knowledge and power to the "World-Spirit" ("Absolute Mind" - God) represented by none other than the philosopher Hegel. Since the World-Spirit as the real lord (actor, bearer) of history uses consciously the individuals, national spirits, etc., as his tools for his own purposes, he is "cunning." He himself "remains in the background, untouched and uninjured," above history which finds its fulfilment in him. He is the subject, the historical agents (nations, great individuals, masses, etc.) only the objects of history. 8Cf. the previous article in PHYLON, Vol. II, 1941, pp. 238-249 esp. pp. 243 ff. 57</page><page sequence="13">PHYLON Now Marx no less than Hegel alleges that he sees through all the tricks of world-history for the first time and reaches an adequate understanding of history and society in his own social Theory. As little as Hegel does he appreciate his Theory as a purely personal achievement. He sees in it rather the highest expression of the "Class-Consciousness of the Proletariat." As in Hegel the World-Spirit is the representative on earth of the "Absolute Mind" (God), so in Marx the Proletariat is the momentary and present representative of all past and future Humanity. The Proletariat alone has a true consciousness and a correct social theory; it alone is not only object, but at the same time the subject of history. When the proletariat acts in the interests of history and humanity, it knows it. All the other classes from the remote past to the present never knew about their function and role in the realization of the classless society of the future. Thus they were only objects of history, tools in the hands of "cunning" history which has gained complete self-knowledge only now in the appearance of the Class- Consciousness of the Proletariat. Marx, then, did not, as Hegel did, see world-history as the "Cunning" of the "Absolute-Mind"; but he did see it as a cunning trick played by future humanity upon poor, defenceless mankind of the days of class society!"6 It would be an error to assume that Marx developed his philosophy of history and society for the sake of "pure knowledge." To be sure, the nineteenth century witnesses, as the result of a previously unattained degree of division of labor, the success of the slogan "Art for Art's sake" and thus also the triumph of scientific endeavor envisioned without reference to any practical purpose. Marx, on the other hand, resuming the practical 6This problem has been perceived clearly by the philosophical communists Georg Lukacs and, still more critically, Joseph R6vai who has formulated it in terms of German Transcenden- tal Idealism as follows: "The concrete discov- ery of the proletariat as at the same time actor (subject) and object of history . . . means on the other hand that no such identity of actor and object has existed in past history . . . History occurs but it has not occurred ... But what else is this idea than that of Hegel's World-Spirit? The past, which is understand- able only in contemplation is (in this concep- tion) always opposed to the final elimination of the problem of the thing-in-itself. This prob- lem of the thing-in-itself reappears in history (as over against past or prehistory) as the contrast between the "true", original char- acter of past epochs and the way this char- acter "appears" to the subject of historical con- templation.... The proletariat is only the per- sonification of the subject (actor) of history as a whole, but it is not directly identical with this subject. The Proletariat as the subject and object of capitalist society, as the actor of his- tory is not identical with the subject of the universal history which is posited only as a correlate but cannot be concretely ascertained. The proletariat as an identical subject-object of a determined historical epoch has from its specific standpoint to project into the past a uniform subject of universal history which finally has become identical with itself .... In the centre of history stands the "not being man" . . . The proletariat which embodies in its own inhumanity the deprived existence of men of all class societies, must assume, never- theless, some merely "existing" man, who is only negatively determined. A human being, whose realization through the accomplishment of the proletariat is the aim of the historical process, is, therefore transcendentally inherent in this process, in which it is, however, a merely subjective and transcendent imputation. This "man" . . . who is to be realized through the proletariat is nothing but mythology. The relationship between Hegel and Marx is even closer than appears from Lukacs own posi- tion."

Today it appears rather evident that his interpretation of the past of human development served primarily to contribute toward conquering as rapidly as possible the promised land of the future. And because of the decisive role of the future in Marx's philosophy of history this essay will be concluded with a critical sketch of Marx's peculiar picture of the land of promise - that means, of course, his concept of the "Classless Society." Marx sees, as has been mentioned, the decisive, qualitative break in the transition from capitalism to socialism, and the "Kairos" of mankind in the transition from bourgeois to classless society. Here he deifies the new man and glorifies the new society. Mankind saved by the new Messiahs, the "proletariat," is reborn in the classless society as a true community of the zoon politikon. Only now do all men think and act according to the commandment of one sole Reason, they subject their drives to their insight, and they develop themselves fully while controlling their own forces. All transcendence belongs now to the remote past. Now finally has history realized that prophetic promise which had at all times been latent in it. Out of human ugliness, out of human inadequacy and misery, now grows the beauty, justice and harmony which had been dreamed of, but had never been realized. Here all shortcomings are eliminated, the bad becomes good, and "das Unzulaengliche wird zum Ereignis"! Yet in spite of all its novelty the classless society is thought of by Marx as retaining and conserving some characteristics of the past. On the one hand it is, of course, the end of the previous history of class-society de- graded by Marx insofar to a mere "pre-history." On the other hand, it is just in this same society that the past and present of human development seen thus as the true "history" - find their coronation and conclusion. A new historical age is to begin in this way which has nothing in common with the traditional economic, social, political, ideological struggles of "pre-history" and yet represents a continuation and unprecedented flower- ing of technical, scientific and artistic development. The disappearance of both exploitation and division of labor in the field of technical and intellectual endeavor is deemed to result in a new all embracing universal humanism. All the economic and sociological, political and legal, ethical and metaphysical, religious and ecclesiastical ideologies - since they are related to the past social stratification - will have gone, but material pro- Leipzig, 1923, Vol. XI, p. 229 ff., esp. pp. 233- "0Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" XI, Selected 236.

Marx is, of course, not concerned with the problem whether some sides of spiritual creation as, for instance, art is not in fact intimately bound up with social stratification and "reactionary" psychology. We may suspect after all that Marx predicts rather arbi- trarily the future of those human activities which enjoy his sympathy! There are other inner inconsistencies in Marx's concept of a classless society.71 One of cardinal importance seems to be that in it freedom and equality are both supposed to be realized almost completely. In present conditions both these ideals cannot be realized simultaneously among highly developed, and heterogeneous personalities, if these personalities are more "Faustian" than saintly. Freedom means here the absence of all con- straints and absolute self-determination. But if the members of the com- munity are in fact quite different from one another, it is highly improbable that their material concerns will mutually agree; nor does it even seem probable that their agreement will go far enough to make possible the functioning of a peaceful administrative procedure. A great diversification among men, a really strong individualism, does not allow of absolute free- dom and absolute equality. The realization of freedom would work to the detriment of a complete equality and justice. Total equality of rights, on the other hand, could only be realized with relatively little liberty and much coercion. Both together are realizable only if the members of society are so altruistic and socially minded that they come very close to the old Christian ideals of fellowship and brotherhood, charity and saintliness. Yet, as we shall see, the material conditions of Marx's classless society, especially its dynamism, make the predominance of this type proble- matical. It is not possible to assume that a greater similarity among men will solve this problem. Similarity is conceivable, particularly on a world scale, only as the result of a tremendously long process not only of decades but of centuries, even if one assumes for a moment that conditioning is all-powerful, which would reduce to a minimum, or would exclude, all hereditary factors: an assumption which is unwarrantably favorable for Marx. Even then one would need time in order to overcome completely that "past," in which men have lived under completely different condi- tions, in which they still live, and in which they will live even in the future! It is, indeed, to be admitted theoretically that similar beings could be produced under equal conditions in the course of an infinitely long time- period. But they would resemble the members of a "mute species," as in primitive society, rather than the modern, cultured individuality which 7'We are at this point not discussing the pos- only dealing with Marx's conception of a com- sibilities or even probability of a transition of pletely developed "classless society." capitalism into some kind of socialism. We are 60 PHYLON</page><page sequence="16">HISTORY AND THEODICY Marx imagines. And then the whole problem disappears since it subsists only in the difficulty of realizing liberty and equality among individuals who are by nature highly diversified! If one examines how Marx himself deduces his concept of a classless society, one will find that he uses mainly Hegel's idealistic dialectical method. Small wonder that Marx's variation of one of Hegel's dialectical Leitmotivs is by no means less artificially constructed than Hegel's was. Why is it that the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat, which does not even exist in any pure form, will have such a far-reaching and clearly predetermined effect as the classless society? Why is it that the synthesis: society without classes and authority should be the only possible synthesis to evolve out of the thesis: bourgeoisie and the antithesis: pro- letariat? On the contrary, does not this dialectical relationship, as almost any other, allow for a whole range of synthesis? There is, indeed, no logical and dialectical way of proving either the concrete content of a synthesis, or even that a synthesis must evolve. Logically-dialectically one could think instead, for instance, of a simple turn-about of the relation, which would change in the end the servant into the master and the master into the servant. One could also think of a quick formation of new rela- tions of authority and sub-ordination in the system of new "freedom." To be sure, it is not absolutely impossible that Marx's absolute turn towards freedom could occur - a turn which would bring to an end at least this specific dialectical development, eliminating once for all the dynamics of the class struggle. It is true, belief in the dialectical change has always and everywhere been present in the history of man's thought; one needs to recall only the many proverbs of the type "God is closest where distress is greatest" or "It has to get very bad so that it may become better." And it is true that there are structures in nature as well as in history which correspond to this dialectics. But this dialectical structure is by no means always present. How often has man's distress been infinite without the imminent presence of "God"! Marx is not to be reproached simply for having used these dialectical schemes since our understanding would not get very far without them. But instead of using them most cautiously as mere hy- potheses, which had to be constantly verified by, and revised through, experience, Marx, and, still more, the Marxists, made naively and quite unconsciously the dialectical hypothesis into a self-evident dogma and eternal truth - a primitive procedure which has certainly revenged itself terribly in the development of Marxism! What may be purely logically-dialectically conceivable may yet be historically highly improbable. It is precisely Marx's and Engels' own historical investigations which have traced the many-sided forms of class- cleavage and exploitation that so strikingly make their concept of the 61</page><page sequence="17">PHYLON classless society appear almost as fantastic, utopian and chiliastic as, for example, the new world of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity dreamt of by the revolutionaries of 1789. Marx and Engels themselves show again and again how human society has undergone tremendous changes in the course of its development without ever getting rid of the character of class society, at least in its age of "civilizations." They emphasize, it is true, that the class societies of civilized man have evolved out of the primitive, classless, tribal communities. However, Engels' attempt to prove that the primitive social order was one of "freedom, equality, and fraternity,""' as compared with the later class societies, was not quite suc- cessful. More recent investigations have emphasized still more the many elements of psychological constraint, irrationality, and inertia which went to make up an atmosphere in which the primitives suffered as victims of their own mentality. In fact, the culture of the primitives appears to be so far removed from the ideal dream of a free, harmonious, "human" community that it cannot testify much on behalf of the classless society of the future. In any event, the "noble savage" belongs to the past and the breakdown of his civilization is evidence neither for nor against the probability of a repetition of classless society. Both classless and class so- cieties of the past seem to prove little more than that human history so far has been the story of misfortune and frustration, maladjustment and dis- content. In this the pessimistic Kulturkritik from Mandeville, Rousseau and Kant to Klages, Theodor Lessing and Freud has not yet been refuted by the cultural optimism of Marx nor any one else. At least in recent cen- turies the development of civilization has not been a way of joys but a way to Golgatha with immense sacrifices and sufferings and it is not so unlikely that it will so remain in the near future. The radical "new" in human history which impressed Marx so pro- foundly is the extraordinary increase in productivity which seems to grow during the whole of human history in geometrical proportion and to reach unforeseen heights in the nineteenth century. Now it may even be assumed that productivity will grow still more rapidly in the future than at any previous time (a development which is probable but certainly not assured). If this development were to go further in the direction of a dynamic-tech- nical world economy and culminate in a permanent and stable, world- wide, planned economy (which is already much more questionable!) the great question remains why the expected and hoped-for social, political, cultural and spiritual developments, which Marx summarizes in his con- cept of "classless society," should coincide with this. If it is true that classless society (in its primitive form) is compatible with the lowest 2F. Engels, Der Ursprung, p. 176, quoting from Lewis H. Morgan's Ancient Society . . London, 1877, p. 552. 62</page><page sequence="18">HISTORY AND THEODICY degree of productivity, it is the more problematic that an increase in pro- ductivity must result in the kind of society predicted by Marx. Already today it appears more probable that selfishness, inequality, exploitation, and class cleavages may be correlated with a slowly, as well as a rapidly, increasing productivity and with the expansion and stratification of society beyond the narrow limits of family, clan, tribe, nation, etc. Classless so- ciety and class-society may well be interpreted and opposed as realiza- tions of a low and a relatively high system of production, technology, and social structure. Hitherto, it is precisely progress in productivity which has made exploitation and class cleavage possible. These, to be sure, have assumed the most varied forms at the different stages of productive development. Yet through all these forms there have remained essentially the same inequality, exploitation and cleavage. Engels himself unifies slavery, serfdom, and wage labor as "the three great forms of servitude" which "are characteristic of the three great epochs of civilization."73 Why, then, should just the next increase in productivity - considerable as it may be - make all exploitation and inequality once and forever impossible? Why should not our civilization, too, breed new forms of servitude, as for instance forced labor for the state in a partially or even totally planned economy with high productivity? There is especially no reason to believe that the highest degree of pro- ductivity could ever bring about an equilibrium of demand and its satis- faction. Marx himself says that the demand increases as well as productive capacity;74 and he has pointed out that it is precisely the production of goods which itself creates human demands.75 But if in a dynamic economy certain demands remain necessarily unsatisfied, the struggle for privileged satisfaction is likely to persist. The most primitive and necessary of these demands may be removed as an object of the struggle, which in itself is an important prerequisite for the more civilized form of the struggle since it will not then be concerned with the bread for bare existence. It may also be that comparison with the past and its low standard of living will dull the intensity of the struggle. But the stimulus will still remain to compare the satisfaction of one's needs with the satisfaction of the needs of others higher in the hierarchy of the social order and to compare them also in the imagination with one's hopeful expectations of the future. Thus Marx's belief in the economic dynamism of classless society which must result in the creation of ever new demands makes the unfolding and predominance of a Christian "lamb-psychology" - indispensable for the realization of equality and liberty among heterogenous individuals - very difficult. The improbability of the prevalence of this psychology in a dynamic "Engels, Der Ursprung... p. 172. Works, Vol. I, p. 268. "Marx, Capital, Vol. III, p. 954 e. g.; cf. "Marx, Zur Kritik ...

The dynamics of production assumes and produces the "Faustian," acti- vistic man. Certain qualities of "push", disregard for others and of an activistic attitude must be developed in the struggle against natural forces. And it is questionable whether an energetic man of action will not inevitably deal also with his fellow men in a corresponding manner. Greed, pursuit of profits, and avarice may be peculiar to a society based on a money-and-commodity-economy; and they may for this reason reach their climax in capitalism as the "acquisitive society" par excellence. Self-assurance, self-assertion, egoism of many varieties, ruthlessness, shrewdness, lust for power, sexual covetousness are probably associated with any modern-technological, economic-dynamical society, particularly as long as it is divided into nations. The existence and indispensability of a small group of such characters in a society results in either subjecting this society to its rule and producing new relations of social dependence and exploitation, or in imbuing with the same character all the others who desire not to succumb in the struggle for existence. There is here some- thing which one might call the marginal power of the men who are the wolves, or, to use another simile, the "lions and foxes."76 Even where men act in the interest of the whole, the problem of power and self-assertion remains and with it that of prestige, vanity, etc., especially where important and intricate judgments and decisions are concerned which deal with im- portant ends and fundamental values, or with the technics and methods of their realization. Marx, whose psychological notions were at the level of the homo oeconomicus pyschology, was not at all aware of these problems which since Freud are at least posed if not answered. Here a Marxist would, of course, object that high productivity is only the "mother" of the emancipation of mankind and that there is a "father," too, in the proletariat. After the experiences of the last decades it is dif- ficult to believe it even capable of as much revolutionary strength and power as the bourgeoisie has shown in recent centuries. History has shown that a suppressed class becomes the master of society only after having reached a high degree of self-reliance and independence, of skill and knowledge, of wealth and power. The proletariat is even today much farther from such a position than, for instance, the so-called new middle- classes. It is even doubtful whether its great bulk of unskilled and half- skilled workers will ever reach a status in society comparable with that of the bourgeoisie several centuries ago. The role of the proletariat in the transformation of capitalist society seems to remain secondary at its best. Even if we see the rise of planned economy and socialist society, it will not be the creation of the proletariat. Still less will it mean the end of history 6Machiavelli, The Prince, Chapter XVIII. 64</page><page sequence="20">HISTORY AND THEODICY 65 as humanity's blind staggering into the dark of the future. The proletariat is not the master of past and future history; it was not chosen to lift the veil from the statue at Sais so that it may see the Truth. If there be a his- torical destiny, it is as impenetrable and inexorable to the proletariat as Fatum and Dike seemed to be to the Ancients. Yes, it mocks perhaps at the proletariat with more cruelty than at many other classes. The conclusion of this essay is that Marx's notion of "classless society" is among the most foolhardy of utopias, compared with which Aldous Huxley's ironic vision of a "Brave New World" appears realistic, even if it should prove to be an anticipation not of the world of tomorrow but of that of the day after. And Marx's theory of history is essentially an im- posing and monstrous ideology conceived to justify this utopia!7 7There are other sidelights-less dazzling and yet brighter-than the Hegelian will-o'-the wisp-upon Marx's conception of history.
