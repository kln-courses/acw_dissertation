It covers a period of more than 2000 years and its spread through vast Mesoamerican zones, begin- ning with its birth in the Olmec culture of the Late Formative up to its current presence in suburban zones. It is incidental to the Postclassical and then colonial power centers. The author suggests that the alter ego animal belief was alive and present with the subaltern classes of the Nahuas in the Mexican High- land even before the Spanish conquest.

Introduction 1.1 Tonalism and Nagualism Some aspects of the popular indigenous religion in Mesoamerica have been known by the name of tonalism and nagualism, terms and concepts which have often been confused and misunder- stood. These concepts belong to the indigenous ideology and determine some aspects of man's occupancy in the indigenous universe, concepts present in various forms in Mesoamerica since prehistoric times and until nowadays. The common typical definitions of these terms are: "tonalism," indicating the belief in a partic- ular relation between a person and generally an animal or an atmospheric phenomenon. A relation between a man and an animal expressing physical and spiritual identity, a coessence unifying the individual to a particular animal or atmospheric phenomenon for the whole life, and called the "tonal" of the person involved in the relationship - his alter ego. "Nagualism," indicating the belief in individuals gifted with the capacity of transform- ing themselves into animals - without losing their human conscience and nature disguised under their animal vests. A dominant factor in the history of the eth- no-anthropological study of tonalism and nagual- ism is the confusion between these two terms or concepts: in both cases it concerns a particular relationship between an individual and a speci- fied animal, and thus tonalism and nagualism are terms differentiating or identifying according to places and research-perspectives variations. The variants of these concepts amongst the various indigenous groups in Mesoamerica are manifold as well as anthropologists' definitions, sometimes specific and local, sometimes generic, regarding Mesoamerica in its whole. This paper deals with some unresolved prob- lems in the study of tonalism, problems mainly concerning the historical vicissitude of the alter ego animal belief: where, when, and why it was born; why it was absent in the official religions of the Postclassical states; why it appeared in the Mexican Highland (or in the reports of chroniclers who studied it) only in the first decades of the 17th century. It presents a model of the histor- ical vicissitude of the alter ego animal belief in Mesoamerica which, though lacking indisputable proofs, resolves the "unresolved problems" which constitute the starting point of our historical recon- struction. 1.2 A Short Examination of the History of Tonalism and Nagualism The theme of tonalism and nagualism, for the peculiarity and ambiguity, drew the attention of scholars and researchers since the 19th century. Hence, the available bibliography is abundant: many scholars expressed many different opinions, often contradictory, now and then giving a new trend to the research and new means to under- stand and define tonalism and nagualism. Two main aspects portray the study of tonalism and nagualism: the conceptual analysis of these pe- culiar beliefs and the historical reconstruction of</page><page sequence="2">446 Josef Paz their development. We shall mainly focus on the second aspect (although it is often very hard to do so independently of the first one). In this chapter we shall refer to some scholars who have worked on this theme and whose works represent the most significant phases in the study of the history of ton- alism and nagualism. To point out the ambiguity and the terminological uncertainty accompanying this study, we will submit a list of the definitions proposed by the various authors who investigated the theme. D.G. Brinton in 1894 (see Foster 1944: 86) defined nagualism as a secret society with a myste- ric cult implying horoscopes and transformation into animals, expressing an organized opposition against European government and religion. G. Fos- ter in 1944 (98 f.), differentiating between nagual and tonal, defined nagual as the animal in which the man can transform himself - the "transforming witch," and the tonal as the man's guardian an- imal, representing his personal destiny, rejecting as product of the imagination Brinton' s idea of nagualism as a secret society. To the contrary J. Pitt-Rivers (1970: 186 f.) pointed out the common denominator of tonalism and nagualism, defining them on the whole as a particular type of relation between a man and an animal, somehow to be compared to the North American totemism, but distinguished from it for the lack of the collective sense existing in this kind of relation and due to the complete lack of veneration towards this animal. It is a relation that defines the man as an individual and not as an occupant in the social structure. But, Pitt-Rivers points out that in this definition there is also a geographical aspect because the phenomenon presents different nuances north and south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec: The nagual of Chiapas and Guatemala is a "destiny-animal," "animal-companion" and "guardian-spirit," while in the north nagual means "sorcerer" or "trans- forming witch." A. Hultkrantz (1979: 71) defines nagualism as a particular type of the Pan-American concept of the guardian-spirit, characteristic of the high cultures of Nuclear- America and of surround- ing tribal cultures in which, being the individual intensely identified with his guardian-spirit, the lat- ter can become the man's ego exponent - his alter ego. Nagual as a technical term is a guardian-spirit so intimately linked to his human protégé to share with him his fate. B. Saler (1964: 309 ff.) basing his argument on information gathered among the Maya-Quiché, contrary to Pitt-Rivers' concise def- inition, proposes a plurisignificative one (changing according to its context) for which nagual is: 1) The affinity existing between a human being and a specific living animal sharing his destiny. 2) The zodiacal sign on which the child was born, deter- mining his character and his attributions of man. 3) The person's birthday within the Maya-Quiché calender made of 260 days. 4) Each pueblo patron saint representing the pueblo nagual. 5) The earth's and other sacred objects' inner spiritual essence. A clear feature is implied in this speciman of nagual/tonal definitions, formulated by historians and anthropologists since the mid 19th century: this term is confused and ambiguous, both in its technical level of designation by scholars and in its conceptual level by natives. I find it useful, as a first step, to isolate the common denomina- tor among these various definitions of nagual and tonal, setting apart the two exceptional and less significant cases of nagual as the village patron saint and as the spiritual essence of the earth (Saler 1964: 310 f.). Two elements are clearly present in all these definitions: 1) the spiritual mystic link man-animal; 2) the concept of the man's individ- ual predetermined destiny. Two elements which, in our opinion, constitute the conceptual nucle- us of this complex and ambiguous phenomenon called tonalism and/or nagualism, designating an entire range of beliefs, originating from the various combinations in various places and times of these two fundamental elements. 1.3 The Etymological Approach The etymological track in the study of the sub- ject is a relatively secure one though not always relevant in its attempt to clarify the meanings of these terms in several current cultures, for which nagual and tonal represent a foreign influence: Nahua words were introduced, probably, in the Postclassic period after the Aztec expansion. According to Seler (1980: 5), the word tonal in its significance as a companion animal derives from "tonalamatl" (= the book of fate) that was the Aztec divinatory calendar in which the day symbols where often animals. The word tonala- matl in its turn is derived from tona which means "warmth," "sun irradiation," "day." According to Lopez Austin (1980/1: 223) the word tonali had among the Nahuas of the 16th century the follow- ing meanings: "warmth," "summer," "day," "sym- bol of the day," "person's destiny according to the birth day," "soul." Therefore, tonal in its "day" meaning in the "tonalamatl" assumed the meaning of "symbol of the day" and then of "destiny" until it came to designate the "destiny animal" - the alter ego animal. Lopez Austin proposes the Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="3">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 447 identity of the current tonal figure (= the alter ego animal) and his human correspondent as the basis for understanding why what was called pre- Columbian times "tonali" and considered, among other things, a luminous entity within the human body is currently called "sombra": the man as a shadow projected on the earth by his energy source, the solar and luminous being - his alter ego animal, the tonal. De la Serna in 1656 (see Foster 1944: 89) suggest that the term nagual was derived from the Nahuatl word nahualtia, translated by him into "to hide," "to cover up," "to disguise," "to mas- querade." Starting from Seler (1980: 50), modern studies confirm that the word nagual originates from ancient Nahuatl and assert that, in its origi- nal sense, the idea to assume a different form, to disguise, was predominant. Foster too (1944: 89) accepts this etymological derivation on the basis of which he formulates his definition of nagual as a "transforming witch." Another track is the one proposed by Aguirre Beltrán (1973: 98) ac- cording to which nagual is an Aztec word de- rived from Huaxtec signifying "wisdom," "knowl- edge," "magic." Naualpilli (lit. meaning "the wis- dom head") was a Huaxtec divinity who, after the Aztec conquest, was assimilated in the winners' pantheon as the image of Tlaloc, the ancient plu- vial god. His priests were very powerful guardians of the people's welfare and nourishment, deemed capable of transforming themselves into animals, an expression of their power and wisdom. The Spanish conquest eliminated Naualpilli, but not his priests who, due to the Catholic influence, lost their positive attributions to become sorcer- ers, according to the medieval Catholic model. Hence, although different, both proposals confirm the Nahua origin of the word. Foster (1944: 89), summing up, asserts that the word seems to have spread in other languages of southern Mexico and Guatemala, probably as a consequence of Aztec migrations that brought Nahua groups as far as Nicaragua. This word, originally designating the "transforming witch" met in these Southern re- gions another fundamental American concept - that of the personal guardian spirit - to which it was applied. This explains the double word pres- ence in various southern cultures to designate the companion animal. Parallel to the word nahual are present, for example, the words wayohe in the Tzeltal language, chanul in the Tzotzil lan- guage, alshik in the Quiche language, neomba- siiklneawineay in the Huave language. In short, the etymological tracks, though being unable to indicate the origin of both the belief in the alter ego animal and that of the transformation of some men into animals, may indicate the origin of the terms designating them. The different etymologies of nagual and tonal, although sometimes different and contradictory, always lead to the Nahua cul- ture. They are ancient Nahuatl words, that spread from the Mexican Valley in almost the whole of Mesoamerica. Accepting Foster's statement that the study of nagualism is that of a word history, we believe that the diffusion of the word does not tally with the diffusion of the beliefs it indicates: the belief in the alter ego animal and the belief in men transformation into animals that somehow were already present in Mesoamerica even before the Nahuas' spread in the Postclassical period, as we shall try to demonstrate later on. 1.4 Unresolved Problems Concerning Tonalism and Nagualism The studies carried out in the last 50 years suc- ceeded (although not always completely) to dis- tinguish and define tonalism and nagualism, ex- plaining their functions as religious beliefs in var- ious Mesoamerican indigenous cultures and the motives for which this big confusion characteriz- ing their study was created. Notwithstanding the above, some important questions were not suf- ficiently clarified and there are question marks and unresolved problems that continue to disturb. The first problems, ensuing from what we have noticed up to now, are those regarding the termi- nological aspect of the alter ego animal belief in Mesoamerica: a) Why and when did the Nahua word tonalliy meaning "solar warmth," "destiny," become a word meaning the alter ego animal? b) Why and when did the Nahua word nahualli, meaning "transforming witch," become mostly in Guatemala and Chiapas a word meaning the alter ego animal? These two etymological problems, still open, lead us to the various hypotheses of researchers on the historical reconstruction of the phenomenon development. The majority of researchers, on the trail of George Foster, assumes that the belief in the alter ego animal originated in the southeast of Mesoamerica, from where it reached the Mexican Highland during early colonial times. Signorini e Lupo (1989: 40) write about tonalism: "This belief was not noticed in the Highland during the conquest period and its origin seems to be traced in the South-Eastern Mesoamerican cultures." The difficulties in the colonial diffusion hypothesis of tonalism are clear: a) It is based on the fact that Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="4">448 Josef Paz the belief in the alter ego animal was not noticed by early Spanish chroniclers. But, as Pitt-Rivers (1970: 197) pointed out, the Spanish chroniclers were anyhow clergymen conceiving the indige- nous religion always through the filter of medieval Catholicism. In other words, Pitt-Rivers affirms that the Spanish priests could only understand the nagual as a transforming witch whose powers derived from the devil to demolish Christianity and could not at all perceive the idea of the alter ego animal as alien to their conceptual world, b) Lopez Austin (1980/1: 470 f.) pointed out another limitation in the Spanish chroniclers' works which is their tendency to try and present a mostly coher- ent system omitting those elements which do not fit in with the general ideological structure. They registered, actually, the ideology of predominant groups, homologizing the various and different cosmovisions. Therefore, the fact that tonalism was not mentioned by early Spanish chroniclers does not prove its absolute absence amongst the 16th century Nahuas (for example, maybe with- in the subaltern classes whose religious beliefs were, according to Lopez Austin (1980/1: 7 f.), ignored by early chroniclers), c) Contacts among the various Mesoamerican native populations be- came much more limited after the conquest. Lopez Austin (1980/1: 32) in view of the above and in reference to the indigenous autochthonous re- ligious ideas states that: "es poco probable que tales concepciones se hayan difundido después de la conquista, ya que a partir de ella los pueblos indígenas tuvieron entre si una communicación más restringida que en la antigüedad." Accepting that the deculturation of the indigenous cultures was of a Hispano-Catholic stamp and that the com- munication transfers amongst the various regions were effected mainly by Spaniards, how could a belief entirely foreign to Christianity be born or spread in the Mexican Highland during the first colonial period!? All this leads to the more general problem of the historical reconstruction of the development of tonalism: Where, when, and why was it born? When did it reach the Nahua culture and why was it absent from the 16th century chroniclers' reports regarding the Aztec religion? This aspect of the study of the alter ego animal belief will be dealt within the following parts of this paper. 2. The Historical Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal Belief in Mesoamerica 2.1 Introduction to the Ethnohistorical Reconstruction of the Belief in the Alter Ego Animal Many scholars have proposed various models to explain the historical development of tonalism and nagualism, models which always stand as speculative hypotheses lacking proof. Lopez Aus- tin (1980/1: 431) states: "Hoy por hoy faltan bases para afirmar si existió [in the 16th cen- tury] esta creencia [in the alter ego animal] en toda Mesoamerica." For the same reason of miss- ing data, Tranfo (1979: 159 f.), summing up the Huave case, writes: "Nagual and tonal seem to be scattered pieces of an incomplete chessboard" containing "contradictions which, in conclusion seem to me, the result of various missing links, without which the connections fail to be. I there- fore find it difficult to reconstruct at present . . . the system created by the Huave in the colonial period." It means that this lack of historical data renders the number of the unknowns too high to be able to resolve definitely the question of tonalism and nagualism. This does not prevent us from proposing and elaborating models of the historical development of these beliefs, as indeed it was done by many scholars. In our opinion, only a minor- ity of them considered tonalism according to its specific historicosocial context of pre-Columbian times. Not one of the already mentioned scholars discusses the possible relations between the Aztec ideological system (whereby people communicate with the supernatural through their tlatoani) and the belief in the alter ego animal which allows the man a personal access to the supernatural. In view of this, I find Pitt-Rivers' (1970: 196) affirmation a little strange: "It is not hard to think of speculative explanations on the basis of the difference between Aztec und Mayan culture to account for the greater importance today of the transformer north of the Isthmus and of the destiny-animal south of it." Anyhow, neither Pitt-Rivers nor the other au- thors mentioned in this paper have tried in the models they elaborated to correlate the presumed history of tonalism to the specific sociopolitical conditions created in Postclassical Mexico by the Aztecs. Only a few of these works consider the belief in the alter ego animal as an integral part of the Pan-American religiousness, characterized by the relation and mystic identification of man with the natural species (the so-called totemism) and the individualistic tendency of single hunt- Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="5">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 449 ers towards this kind of mystic identification (the so-called "individual totemism" - see Hultkrantz 1979: 81, 141). These fundamental elements, we believe, contain the germ of the belief in the alter ego animal: man's identification with the animal world, characteristic of totemism and the human individual destiny realized through the bond with a certain animal. On such a basis we believe that the idea of an interactive encounter between some "totemistic" beliefs, and the divinatory calendar (perhaps in the Olmec culture) can represent a starting point to the elaboration of an historical model explaining the origin and development of the belief in the alter ego animal as the idea of a theriomorphic fate, determined by means of the zodiacal consultation. We shall again start with Lopez Austin's affir- mation refusing the possibility of the spread of the originally American religious beliefs after the con- quest, which makes Seler's and Foster's theories of the colonial development/spread of tonalism ques- tionable. Foster (1944: 99) writes: "Seler suggests that the companion-animal idea is a development of the 17th and 18th centuries. Although I believe it to be an older belief, it unquestionably became much more widespread during this period." This theory's problematic issues (besides what we have previously pointed out) lies in the diffusion and development of a religious phenomenon foreign to the Hispano-Catholic culture at early colonial times, driving this theory towards the understand- ing of tonalism-nagualism in terms of a revivalistic cult, opposed to the Hispano-Catholic oppression, hence bringing Foster closer to Brasseur de Bour- bourg and Brinton from whom he just wanted to space out for their "imaginary" theories (consid- ering nagualism as an anti-European revivalistic cult). We suggest that trying to avoid these imag- inary theories, we have to avoid also whatever idea of any birth, development, or diffusion of the belief in the alter ego animal during colonial times. This, theoretically, leaves a single alternative: the alter ego concept was alive and present in vast areas of Mesoamerica (central Highland included), even before the conquest. Therefore, accepting the improbability of the birth/diffusion of tonalism in the colonial period, we have to try and demonstrate the pre-Columbian origins of the alter ego animal belief, temporarily leaving aside the fact of its absence in the reports of early Spanish chroniclers. It is possible to do so in two ways: 1) single out archaeological finds with artistic motives that can be interpreted as evidences to the pre-Columbian presence of the alter ego animal belief; 2) evaluate the connection of the alter ego animal belief as a religious belief within the pre-Columbian ideolog- ical complex. 2.1.1 Archaeological Evidence to the Pre-Columbian Presence of the Alter Ego Animal Belief J. Haekel (1952: 125) writes: "During early pe- riods of ancient cultures in Mesoamerica and An- dean regions we can now find on sculptures, earth- enware, and other works of art the same animal figure in its characteristic conjunction to the head or shoulders of an anthropomorphic figure. Several researchers perceive in these images an expression of the alter ego meaning . . . K. Th. Preuss sup- ported in two works the primary wholeness of the archaeological alter ego images in ancient Ameri- can cultures and pursued their connection with the so-called nagualism and similar concepts of the la- ter Indians." Haekel (1952), in spite of his criticism towards those who take for granted the ideological continuity between the ancient stone statues of the Formative period and present indigenous beliefs, concludes: The archaeological portraits showing the peculiar combinations of an animal over the head or shoulders of an anthropomorphic figure in mighty stonesculptures, terra-cotta vessels and small plastic art pieces encountered in various ancient American cultures, but especially in their early periods (San Augustin, La Venta, Nicaragua) can most probably be seen, to some extent, as the artistic expression of the idea of the animal- companion or alter ego as still found today in its characteristic figure in several Indian tribes in Mesoamerica. Some traditions of ancient Mexican, Quiche, Inca, and Witoto, which refer to the pecu- liar figure expressing the alter ego idea or similar concepts, strengthen the assumption of a genetic connection between the archaeological monuments in question and the alter ego belief of histori- cal Indian tribes. Ulrich Köhler also, following Preuss and Haekel, discusses an entire archaeo- logical substratum of the "alter ego motive," ex- tending from Jalisco in the northwest down to Costa Rica in the southeast. According to Köhler (1985: 15), this substratum originated from the Olmec culture and its three centers north of the Isthmus: Très Zapotes, La Venta, and San Lorenzo, that flourished approximately between 1,000 and 500 B.C., which ethnographic remains are still present today amongst the Indian tribes in the form of the alter ego animal belief. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="6">450 Josef Paz 2.1.2 Tonalism and the Pre-Columbian Complex in the Mesoamerican Area The so-called tonalism relates man directly to the extrahuman nature represented by his alter ego animal. A mystic energetic bond (in which the tonal transmits vital energy to the man) guarantee- ing the individual health and success (Signorini e Lupo 1989: 52). It is, therefore, a belief belonging to the indigenous cosmovision, defining the place occupied by the man in the world and the relations interactions between the cosmic levels: the human and the superhuman, the natural and the supernat- ural. According to Lopez Austin (1980/1: 32), the Mesoamerican cosmovisions are interrelated by a common origin of elements, by a constant commu- nication between the various cultures, and by their parallel development. The existence of this ideo- logical unity, already beyond argument, is mani- fested in the similarity of concepts expressed in universe structures, cosmogonies, calendars, ritu- als, legends, magical practices, and pantheons that present several and rich nuances, but that make the coincidence of central concepts doubtless. Even to- day we find confirmation since, in many cases, an- cient ideological elements were transmitted to the indigenous cultures in contemporary Mesoameri- ca, e.g., the nosological complex of susto (derived from the ancient sickness consequent of the loss of the tonalli); the universal and omnipresent opposi- tion combination of the elements "hot" and "cold" that constitute the nature of whatever exists;1 and there are many other examples, which the beliefs connected with tonalism. We shall try to demon- strate this in this paper. Useful to deal with the tonalism phenomenon (in regards to its birth/spread in the pre-Columbi- an times or in those following the Spanish con- quest) are the criteria indicated by Lopez Austin (1980/1: 35 f.) to individuate the autochthonous origin of present cultural elements distinguishing them from what was a product of the acculturation of European or African matrix. According to Lopez Austin the criteria indicat- ing the American origin of cultural elements are: a) The presence of similar beliefs in a large ter- ritory, which proves their ancient common origin. 1 Foster and Anderson (1978: 56-60) suggested a diffusion theory connecting the Amerindian hot and cold elements to the 16th century Hispanic ones, considered of a Galenic and even Hypocrathic origin (5th century B.C.!). This theory was rejected by Marc Auge (Auge e Herzlich 1986: 81- 84), G. Cardona (1985: 5-36), and others who consider these elements an autochthonous product of pre-Columbian Amerindian ideology. b) Harmony in the examined element with the remaining elements in the indigenous ideological systems, c) Coincidence in the relations between the studied element and other elements which are evidently autochthonous, when it occurs in various indigenous societies living in territories with no usual communications since colonial times, d) The equality in the current indigenous societies of the difference between the studied element and the extra-American ones which are believed to have originated it. e) The presence of the studied ele- ment in indigenous societies of different levels of development. It is easier to suppose an autochtho- nous common origin, very ancient, preceding the uneven development rather than a rear homoge- nous acceptance by societies in different phases of development, f) The existence of a native termi- nology related to the studied element that does not correspond to the simple translations, g) The reg- istration of the studied element present right after the European conquest, h) The lack of motivation or interest by the conquerors to introduce or create the studied element or institution. Lopez Austin, in view of the criteria he for- mulated, did not systematically evaluate tonalism, outlining only the fact that the belief in the alter ego after the conquest was not registered in the Highland (see criteria g). As we shall see after- wards, the lack of the alter ego animal belief in the reports of the 16th century does not necessarily indicate its complete absence in the ideological panorama of the Mexican Highland. Besides this, it is a fact that, on the basis of modern ethno- graphic literature, the alter ego animal belief seems to coincide very well with all other criteria. It is present in vast geographical zones of Mesoamerica and it combines harmoniously with other autoch- thonous indigenous elements: the divinatory calen- dar, the "anthropocentric principle" (Lopez Austin 1980/1: 395, the universal combination/opposition of the elements "hot" and "cold" (the word tonal comes from the Nahuatl tono meaning "warm," "luminous"). And it was of no interest to the Spanish to spread it. All this seems to confirm the pre-Columbian autochthonous origin of the belief in the alter ego animal. Accepting this reasoning, we have to find out why the reports of the chron- iclers in the 16th century have ignored the belief in the alter ego animal in the Mexican Highland. There are two theoretical alternatives to explain it: 1) The belief in the alter ego animal was present in the Mexican Highland, but the Spanish chroniclers, being European-Catholic minded clergymen, were incapable of conceiving and, therefore, describing a belief so far from their conceptual world, lacking Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="7">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 45 1 any real collective external representations (as sup- ported by Pitt-Rivers 1970: 196 f.). 2) The belief in the alter ego animal was generally present in the Mexican Highland but was missing in the areas and sociocultural surroundings as studied by early chroniclers. As we shall see afterwards, the second alternative seems more acceptable. There is no rea- son to believe that Ruiz de Alarcón (who was the first, in mid 17th century, to document this belief in the Mexican Highland) was less "Hispano-Cath- olic" minded than Sahagún and Molina. He, too, was a religious man and as such he qualified the native beliefs as "devilish." Notwithstanding this, he acknowledges with no doubt in his work the presence of the belief in the alter ego animal in the Highland of Mexico. Another problem originates out of that with two possible solutions: 1) The be- lief in the alter ego animal developed/spread in the Mexican Highland during the period starting from Sahagún (1529) to that of Ruiz de Alarcón (1629) just as suggested by Foster (that we rejected for the above mentioned reasons). 2) Ruiz de Alarcón based his report on sources coming from sociocul- tural environments or classes different from those on which Sahagún and Molina based their reports, and this, in our opinion, might explain the absence of the registration of the alter ego animal belief in the latter ones, as we shall try to show later on. Therefore, the connection of tonalism with the Mesoamerican ideological complex and the inter- pretation suggested by Haekel and Köhler, regard- ing certain archaeological finds, seem to confirm its pre-Columbian origin connecting it with the Mesoamerican high cultures. But tonalism has also a dominant element which associates it to the so- called "totemistic" beliefs based on the individual identification between men and animals. Some au- thors thought this is the right way to approach ton- alism (Haekel 1952: 174; Hultkrantz 1979: 71-73; L. Laurecchio Minelli: personal communication). Therefore, we shall start our historical reconstruc- tion of tonalism from this perspective considering the alter ego animal as a private case, typical to Mesoamerica, of the great Pan-American ideolog- ical complex of the so-called totemistic beliefs. 2.2 The Totemic Origins of Tonalism As we pointed out some scholars deem that the right way to approach the historical reconstruction of tonalism begins with totemism,2 as was sug- 2 Although at present, following Lévi-Strauss' footsteps, the use of the term "totemism" in ethno-anthropological con- gested, for example, by Josef Haekel (1952: 174) who affirms, speaking about tonalism: We have to refer also to the individual totemism that generally, according to our current knowledge, contains the idea of the companion-animal in reference either to the guardian spirit or the alter ego animal. The same is attested by Hultkrantz (1979: 211): In both cases the intimate connection existing between the hunter and his guardian spirit is expressed: it is the "individual totemism." According to Foster as we previously saw, the origin of the world tonal is within the Nahuatl term tonalli, meaning "personal fate," determined traditionally by the tonalamatl - the divinatory calendar. The connection with animals in the tonal case is due to the pre-Hispanic habit of consulting the tonalamatl, in which every day (and therefore the day of birth too) was under the auspices of peculiar divinities, often in animal form (Tranfo 1979: 139). Foster (1944: 95) writes: "Given the idea that one's destiny is tied up with a particular animal, the identification of this person- ification with the abstract idea of luck or fortune is not a great step." Foster's idea, therefore, is that of a mystic connection between the individual and a certain animal that took place within the ambit of the zodiacal beliefs, and it is because of the com- bination between the belief that the day of birth determines the individual's fate and the belief that this day is dominated by a certain fate represented by animal species, that was formed (in Mesoamer- ican high cultures) the mystic coessential bond between a man and his companion animal. This same combination between animal species and the abstract idea of human destiny was very common in the ancient world. The ancient Babylonians al- so believed that the human character and there- fore man's destiny is determined according to his birth date, dominated by a certain type of destiny, mostly identified with animal species. But, in the ancient Near East the individual mystic identifica- tion of a man with a certain specific animal was absent, and the individual's fate, although often represented by animal species, always remained abstract and general: it was not a specific animal texts is generally avoided, we are using it in this paper in reference to Hultkrantz (1979: 67) according to whom the term "totemism" (that in its general significance represents the common denominator of the most varied definitions supported by theoreticians of American religions) always indicates a certain mystical relation between a human group and a certain natural species - mostly animal. We are using this term to emphasize tonalism belonging to that vast substratum of autochthonous beliefs, typically American, generally called "totemistic." Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="8">452 Josef Paz - physcally and parallely alive in the supernat- ural sphere, specifically embodying the individ- ual's fate, as happens in tonalism. Therefore, to distinguish the belief in the alter ego animal from that of the destiny, decided and indicated by the zoomorphic signs of the Babylonian calendar, we have to recognize in the former the existence of another factor besides that of the fate represented by means of an animal, constituting the base of the intimate bond of coessence between the man and the companion animal. This leads us to what Dur- kheim has called "individual totemism," which we believe represents tonalism's true conceptual base: the intimate mystic identification between man and animal, approximately conceived, in the first case, as a kind of a guardian spirit, representing the individual character inspired by a certain animal, and in the second case, more or less, as a certain type of individual fate (determined by the indi- vidual character fixed according to the birth date and dominated by a specific supernatural animal). Therefore, we have to acknowledge a possible genetic bond between totemism in general and es- pecially the one called "individual" and tonalism. And that is what Haekel (1952: 173) suggested: It is possible to obtain a clearer vision (regarding the alter ego animal belief) only by means of a wider view angle that regards a much larger area of com- parison, containing especially North America and North Asia. Haekel speaks about the concept of the alter ego animal as a minor ideological develop- ment within the high Mesoamerican cultures on the substratum of totemistic beliefs. Köhler (1985: 47) too speaks about the same possibility sustaining the Olmec origin of the concept: A point that has to be explored further is the question of whether the Olmecs did invent these images (of the various types of the alter ego animal) or if they elabo- rated them from an older substratum. The fact that the mythological beliefs in the companion animals make use of models slightly different from those existing in North America proves a high level of uniformity. Therefore, according to Hultkrantz, Haekel, and Köhler the alter ego animal concept represents the result of a certain elaboration of the ancient totemistic beliefs. In view of all the above we consider as im- probable the model suggested by Foster (1944: 99) according to which "the identification of this lucky or guardian soul with animals appears to be an historical accident [in the ambit of the Aztec cul- ture], doubtless stimulated by the existing ideas of the ability of witches to assume animal form." This connection between the alter ego animal and the so called "individual totemism" is not only a hypothetical one. Exceptional cases combining elements of both categories have been registered mainly in primitive cultures within the border-re- gions of the high cultures, from which the idea of the alter ego animal was adopted, framing it into the complex of their more primitive "totemic" beliefs. A clear example is present in the ancient report of Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas (see Foster 144: 89 f.) discussing the belief in the alter ego animal in the province of Cerequin in Hon- duras: "And the devil deceived these people and appeared in a form of a lion, tiger, coyote, alliga- tor, bird, or serpent and these are called naguals, which is to say 'guardians' or 'companions'; and when the animal dies, the Indian bound to it also dies. The manner of making the alliance was this: the Indian went to a river, hill, or hidden place, invoked the demons by their namens ... He carried with him a dog or a chicken which he sacrificed to be prosperous. Then he poured out blood from his tongue, ears, and other parts of his body and made his pact with the animal which said to him: on such a day go hunting, and the first bird or animal that you see will be I, who am to be your nagual and companion for all time and in this manner was established the friendship between a man and an animal, and when one died the other also died." Hence, besides the bond of coessence and of a common destiny, we have in the Cerequin of the early 16th century a typical case of the "North American" type of the guardian spirit concept: attainment of the guardian spirit through a vision obtained by means of isolation and self-torturing to guarantee the individiual's prosperous life. But, strangely, this animal although so powerful dies when its human protégé dies, which renders it an alter ego animal or something similar. Hultkrantz (1979: 74 f.) on the basis of Haekel, comparing the North American "individual totemism" (of- ten called the "guardian-spirit cycle"; Benedict 1923: 67) with the Mesoamerican tonalism pro- poses that both represent a secondary development out of the original shamanism that created what he named a "democratized shamanism." From an initial phase in which the guardian spirit was the shaman's exclusive property, this aspect of the shaman's power has little by little spread in all or almost all social levels: a "democratization" of the shamanic religion terminating with the so-called individual totemism and tonalism whereby every member of the society has its own guardian spirit or companion animal. Notwithstanding this, there are some fundamental differences between these two belief complexes. This is demonstrated, for ex- ample, in a text of the Popol Vuh, representing one Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="9">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 453 of the most antique historical pieces of evidence available regarding the belief in a natural species as an alter ego. This Quiche text, translated into German by Schultze-Jena (Haekel 1952: 153) talks about the two brothers Hunahpu and Xbalanque who, as culture heroes leaving in a mission to eliminate the king of the underworld, said to their grandmother: ". . . saying good-bye to you, grand- mother, we leave you a message: every one of us will plant a cane for himself . . . When this cane dries up, it will be the sign of our death . . . And the grandmother mourned in front of the canes that [after the departure of the two heroes] dried up. The heart of the old woman rejoiced when sprouts reappeared on the canes" (proof of the rebirth of the two brothers). Another confirmation that the cane in this myth was considered as an alter ego species might be its presence in Mayan calendars as day sign numer 13 (Edmonson 1988: 173-177). Therefore the belief in the alter ego animal ex- presses a relation of a coessence between man and animal, a common fate that binds a man to a member of natural species member (a cane plant in the atypical case of the mentioned Quiche myth). Nothing alike exists in the individual totemism of the North American type where the guardian spirit is totally immune against human misfortune and troubles, and its life and destiny are absolutely independent from the human ones. The alter ego animal concept expresses the idea of, we would say, almost an a-collective human individual char- acter - the idea of a social atomism where every man faces alone and individually his own life; where, from an ideological point of view, every man is self-conscious, separate from and indepen- dent of the collectivity he belongs to. The belief in the alter ego animal, within the "democratization" model of ancient American religious forms that we proposed on the basis of Hultkrantz and contrary to the "American theory" regarding totemism origin (Benedict 1923: 57-66), represents the result of a certain elaboration of the ancient totemic beliefs. They had a mystic and collective identification of the whole group with one natural species (animal in most cases) and demonstrated an increasing level of social differentiation and recognition in the group with regard to individuality, up to the extreme point of tonalism in which the mystical identification with animals is total or almost indi- vidual: an exclusive bond between a specific man and a specific animal. This process may represent a growth in the "cultural level": an increase in the number of symbols used in the ideological context; a passage from a single symbol (the clan- nish totem) to a plurality of symbols, the alter ego animals which became as many as the persons in a society. In this perspective tonalism seems to be a richer and more complex symbolic language, elaborated out of a simpler one - shamanism and maybe also clan totemism.3 It is not in our interest, in this paper, to enter the old controversy between Fletcher and R. Benedict (1923: 56-58) regarding the genetic relations between clan totemism and individual totemism. Nevertheless, in contrary to the "American theory" of totemism and in refer- ence to the above mentioned Hultkrantz' s model (elaborated by us), we shall consider that other possibility in order to evaluate tonalism as an elaborated form of "totemic" religious thinking: As from clan totemism, a simpler ideological reality in which the people recognize a single alternative for their human destiny/character - from the col- lective totem representing the unique identification model for the whole society, the Mesoamerican religions reached tonalism in which the hypothet- ically possible alternatives for mystic ideological identification become various, different, and not always clearly and publicly defined. This model fits very well with Lévy-Bruhl's famous model as presented in his "La mentalité primitive" of 1922, dealing with the passage from a primitive mental- ity to a "civilized" one as a transition from the "prelogic" of primitive cultures to the "logic" of more developed ones. In Levy-Bruhl's evolution- ary perspective primitive people represent a phase of humanity in which collective representations were still dominant to the individual ones, which is anyway previous to the rise of individualism (and of individuating logic), breaking intersubjective re- lations. It stands as a critical function in reference to collective representations. Hultkrantz's model of the Mesoamerican transition from primitive sha- manism to individual totemism and tonalism might be seen as a concrete example of Lévy-Bruhl's one. Nevertheless, tonalism has to be considered as a result of a still higher abstraction level than the individual totemism because it generally com- pletely lacks any ritual external aspect, and it tends to express an exclusive relation between an indi- vidual and a specific animal, and not between an individual (in relation to his occupation as hunter, medicine man, warrior, etc.) and a type of animal which guarantees good results of his activities. Pitt-Rivers (1970: 186 f.) clearly explained this difference: "Neither should it [the belief in the 3 In this perspective the monotheism represents a passage from plurality to infinity, since the monotheistic god is, per se, not measurable and impossible to define as single or plural. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="10">454 Josef Paz alter ego animal] be likened to a 'totemistic' rela- tionship (also called 'personal totemism') in which an individual 'respects' ... a particular species of animal ... A man has no tie with the other members of the species of his nagual [= alter ego animal], nor does possession of a nagual of the same species create any bond between two men or any connection between them in the eyes of others, save for the implication that their spirits are of a similar nature and strength. Moreover, the nagual conveys nothing about the social allegiance of its 'owner' (who is often uncertain as to the species to which his nagual belongs); it concerns only his spiritual power, his individual moral character and destiny. In short, it defines him as an individual - like a nickname - and not as the occupant of a particular place in the social structure - like a surname [as it is, to the contrary, in the indi- vidual totemism]. It involves no prohibition and no ritual performances." Therefore, the alter ego animal belief expresses a developed concept of human reality, perceived in its whole complexity and differentiality. An abstract and complex belief that appears to us could only have been born in the Mesoamerican high cultures. 2.3 The Alter Ego Animal Belief and the Predetermined Destiny Concept According to the model we proposed following Hultkrantz, tonalism represents the outcome of a differentiation process of shamanism, in which some aspects of the shaman's guardian spirit were substituted by various and different personal guardian spirits that finally became, in some Me- soamerican cases, alter ego animals. A mystical recognition in the complexity of human reality, eventually representing also a certain cultural de- velopment: the elaboration of a much richer lan- guage of symbols. 2.3.1 The Olmec Origin Here we shall try to outline the "where" and "why" of this development, the motive behind this ideo- logical elaboration that entailed the birth of the al- ter ego animal belief within shamanistic and totem- istic environment. We will begin saying that in our opinion the "totemic" guardian spirit became an al- ter ego animal under the influence of the divinatory calendar devised by Mesoamerican high cultures (probably the Olmec one). The invention of the divinatory calendar added the abstract concept of predetermined destiny to the more primitive con- cept of the guardian spirit or "individual totem." In fact, besides the "individual totemism" the other way to approach tonalism' s historical reconstruc- tion seems to be that of the divinatory calendar, a religious element of fundamental importance in all Mesoamcerian high cultures. The time compu- tation by means of the calendar was based on the discovery of the cyclic predetermined movement of constellations in the sky, that follow their routes with mathematical precision. This made time it- self, computed and conceived through the planets' fixed movement something "predetermined." And if time is predetermined, everything happening within its scheme should be predetermined, and above all, events regarding human life. In this way, on the basis of the astronomic calendar invention, the belief in the predetermined destiny of man was also elaborated. However, it is not of interest to us to go deeper in this subject here and we take for granted the strict conceptual and genetic bond between the invention of the astronomic calendar and the concept of predetermined destiny. Foster (1944: 90 f.) writes: "More often it appears that the determination of the nagual animal depended upon the use of the horoscope . . . Common to Aztecs, Zapotecs, and Mayan tribes of both Yucatan and Guatemala was the 260 day cycle based upon the juxtaposition of 20 day names with 13 numerals. In Aztec, this cycle is known as the tonalamatl . . . Early data suggest that the Aztecs used it primarily to name children and to determine their suerte or fortune." The assignment of the alter ego animal to the concept of destiny reaches the point that the former "has been described variously in Chiapas and Guatemala as the 'destiny animal,' 'animal-companion,' . . . 'spirit-counterpart,' etc." (Pitt-Rivers 1970: 186). On this basis and on the one outlined in the pre- vious chapter we may define the alter ego concept as the outcome of the combination of the following components: the idea of the mystical identification the alter ego predetermined + man/companion animal/ = animal destiny guardian spirit concept As we saw, it is the abstract idea of prede- termined individual destiny that distinguishes the guardian spirit (of the so-called individual totem- ism) from the alter ego animal (of the so-called tonalism). Therefore, for the historical reconstruc- tion of tonalism, we have to begin with the history of the "predetermined destiny" idea. This leads us to the calendar invention and to a much earlier period as the one following the Spanish conquest, Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="11">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 455 during which, according to Seler, Foster, and their followers the alter ego animal concept developed and spread. This leads us from Mesoamerican his- torical cultures to the "archaeological" ones. At this point we can consider Preuss, Haekel, and Köhler's works. In "Die Vorstellung vom Zweiten Ich in den amerikanischen Hochkulturen" Josef Haekel (1952: 143) writes: "The artistic descrip- tion of an animal figure on the back or on the head of a human figure finds its most important expression in Nicaragua and San Augustin. These finding places have a particular position and seem to represent American high cultures' most antique forms . . . When we take into consideration the 'an- imal on man' motive, ... we can see in it an artistic representation of the alter ego animal as compan- ion or guardian of certain individuals." However, today on the basis of recent archaeological dating, it is generally accepted that the origin of ideo- logical and stylistic influences of Mesoamerican high cultures lies in the Olmec culture. And this very hypothesis constitutes the starting point of Ulrich Köhler's study "Olmeken und Jaguare. Zur Deutung von Mischwesen in der präklassischen Kunst Mesoamerikas." Köhler (1985: 15) writes that animal and man combinations are present in Mesoamerican Classical and Preclassical art. The exceptional Preclassical culture was the Olmec one in Très Zapotes, La Venta, and San Lorenzo - Northern Isthmus major centers. There was a blooming period approximately between 1 000 and 500 B.C., in which gigantic heads were sculp- tured. Their influence was spread from Jalisco in the northwest down to Costa Rica in the southeast ... In these times the Olmec culture was the only one to reach and influence the other region cul- tures. Köhler (1985: 45), like Haekel three decades before him, reaches the conclusion that the artistic motive of human and animal features combination present in almost every Mesoamerican Preclassic and Classic high culture, should be interpreted in view of the current beliefs in the alter ego animal: Modern research shows that the various animals described in the "half man/half animal" motive of Olmec provenience belong to the same current In- dian belief's framework, representing a continua- tion to the antique alter ego belief. Such continuity can be demonstrated not only at a general level with the existence of the belief in the alter ego animal as a religious principal, but also at the level of particularities, in regards to the types of animals believed as some men's alter ego and the ideo- logical value they represent. According to Köhler (1985: 23) it was clearly shown that the jaguar was a "destiny-double," representation of extraordinary Olmec men. The same is maintained by Signori- ni and Lupo (1989: 46) regarding the alter ego animals of extremely strong natured individuals in Santiago of Yancuitlalpan, in Sierra de Puebla: ". . . about their tonalme which in case of 'strong' per- sons . . . like sorcerers, are necessarily animals con- sidered malevolent ... as jaguars." Therefore, in Köhler's perspective, for the past 2 000 years, the jaguar was conceived in the high culture religions and those influenced by them as the alter ego ani- mal of men with either spiritual or political power. But the Olmec culture in its artistic descriptions, combining human with animal features, uses not only men of rank, but also and very often young children. In Haekel's words (1952: 129 f.): ". . . La Venta finds are characterized by ... gigantic stone heads, lithic statues, and monuments of a realis- tic and dynamic style preferring jaguar motives and children faces in a particular combination." Therefore, the Olmecs often preferred to combine jaguar motives with such of babies described with infantile features (and not with mature men of rank), maybe to emphasize the importance of the alter ego animal (the jaguar in this case) regarding the birth of the individuals with whom it was tied. This brings us again to the astronomical calendar invention as a crucial point in the elaboration of the alter ego animal concept that necessarily involves Mesoamerican high cultures. Haekel (1952: 188) was the first one to discuss tonalism's origin in terms of an already Preclassic combination be- tween a primitive factor and a "cultured" one: "The alter ego belief has its roots probably in various concepts of man's soul (shadow soul as guardian spirit . . . soul loss because of illness or death) provenient from hunting cultures of a Northamer- ican origin and the contact they established with the founders of high cultures." Speaking about the founders of Mesoamerican high cultures we enter the ambit of the Olmecs. Hultkrantz (1979: 169) writes: "The Olmec . . . culture was the Mesoamer- ican mother civilization. All later cultures were inspired by it, not least in the field of religion. The appearance of this culture has been designated as a real revolution. It was apparently a fully- fledged theocratic culture, with ceremonial centers, . . . There appeared here the first efforts to make hieroglyphics, numerals, and a calendar." For ex- ample the famous Stela C of Très Zapotes that is considered as the most ancient known Mesoame- rican dating interpreted as the 4th of November 291 B. C. It is, therefore, believed that the Olmecs in the first millenium B. C. elaborated this partic- ular time computing and divinatory system which is the divinatory calendar used afterwards by all Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="12">456 Josef Paz Mesoamerican high cultures. Accepting Haekel's idea of the alter ego animal as the result of a historical encounter in Preclassic times between ideas originated in primitive hunting cultures, and others originated in ancient Mesoamerican high cultures, we have to try and indicate within this particular and complex belief the elements that could be attributed to a "cultured" provenience, distinguishing the alter ego animal from the more "primitive" guardian spirit. Tonalism elements of a probable cultured pro- venience: 1) The dominant connection with the divinatory calendar - no doubt a high culture prod- uct. 2) The tonal is a theriomorphic representa- tion of human fate. The same idea of fate as a course of events considered as predetermined, in- variable, and independent from human will stands in contrast to man's instinctive way of thinking, in which we see what we do as, more or less, the direct result of what we intend or try to do, and not as the result of an extraneous, remote, nonhuman will - that of the so-called "destiny," Therefore, the idea of a predetermined destiny or that of the illusion of a human control on man's actions might be seen as a quite elaborated and advanced "philosophical" idea, the result of a certain level of intellectual and cultural capacity. 3) The automatic and obligatory tie between man and his alter ego animal, a tie taken for granted (during life) auto- matically and passively fixed since birth (in great majority of cases), which represents a development of a cosmological philosophy independent of the group morality and the social life regulations: The alter ego animal is always and everywhere the individual's supernatural companion, independent of the moral or immoral behavior of the latter. This is unlike the typical guardian spirit that can break the protection pact with his protégé as a consequence of the violation of a taboo by the man etc. 4) The mutual influence man-tonal: A coessential relation representing a unique case of the single individual's capacity to exert a certain concrete influence on the supernatural sphere; to cause illness and even death to a supernatural being - his tonal animal (while in individual to- temism human death or illness have nothing to do with the condition of his guardian animal spirit). An individual's self consideration regarding his tonal may be considered "higher" when compared to the individual's self-consideration regarding his guardian spirit. A relation of independence against one of mutual dependence - a more equal relation which might express a greater self-esteem of man towards the supernatural - a consideration and self-esteem that could probably be born in the ambit of a society conscious of its capacity of in- fluencing the supernatural, for example by a priest- hood class of a high culture. These sacerdotal or hieratic classes indeed formed the major intellectu- al forces of Preclassic and Classic Mesoamerican high cultures. Some scholars discuss the Olmec revolution in terms of a religious revolution, as F. Katz (1985: 143) writes: ". . . the birth of a new religion, that was spread to the furthest reaching areas of Mesoamerica by the zealous work of mis- sionaries . . . Probably at the beginning, La Venta and Très Zapotes were peaceful ceremonial cen- ters, pilgrim's destinations." Therefore, the alter ego animal concept includes a nucleus of beliefs and ways of thinking suggesting a considerable level of intellectual ability - a "cultured" concept of the place taken by man in the world in regard to the more primitive nucleus of totemic beliefs, representing the ideological substrate upon which, secondarily, tonalism was developed. 2.3.2 The Tuxtla Statuette Up to now we spoke about a "cultured" nucleus in the alter ego belief that led us to the Olmec civilization as its probable birthplace. Besides, we proposed an alteration to Foster's model (1944: 99) in which it was the encounter between the cal- endar signs and the concept of guardian spirit stimulated by the existing ideas of transforming witches who determined the development of ton- alism amongst the Nahuas during the first colonial times. We maintained that this convergence should have occurred much earlier, probably in Meso- american calendar birthplace - the Olmec culture. An archaeological finding that illustrates and ex- presses this encounter with clarity, already within the Olmec civilization, could be in our opinion the famous Tuxtla Statuette, about which M. D. Coe (1962: 94) writes: "Another date [besides the one incised on Stela C], this time with a fairly long, unread text, is inscribed on a small jade figure in epi-Olmec style, a duck-billed, winged figure with human features. This is the Tuxtla Statuette, discovered many years ago in the Olmec area, with the Long Count date of 8.6.2.4.17 (AD 162)." Therefore, accepting the idea of convergence between the concepts of the divinatory calendar and the totemic guardian spirit in Olmec envi- ronment, we should, in our opinion, see in the Tuxtla Statuette an illustrious example of the alter ego animal concept. The figure engraved on the statuette combines man and animal features (a duck) with what may be his birthdate (8.6.2.4.17. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="13">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 457 meaning 162 A.D.) probably, signifying the duck as the alter ego animal of that individual. If this is true, we should expect to find the duck amongst the zodiacal signs of the Olmec calendar. And indeed, in the calendar named by M. S. Edmonson (1988: 172) "Olmec 2," day sign number 15 is a duck. About these zodiacal signs Edmonson (1988: 230) writes: "I believe they may be late classic (and provincial) Olmec." Edmonson, like many other researchers, is not offering a complete de- cipherment of the date engraved on the Tuxtla Statuette (lacking the exact day number). Although it is not the direct aim of this paper, and certainly in need of further investigation, we would dare and suggest the following: excepting the Tuxtla Statuette duck as an alter ego animal, the missing figure of the date might be the duck itself, which represents day numer 15 in the "Olmec 2" calen- dar. Joining number 15 as a figure to Edmonson' s dating (considering month Β as relevant) we gain a complete date: the 4th of February 162 A. D. In short, the interpretation of the duck engraved on the Tuxtla Statuette as the alter ego animal of the man to whom it was dedicated (born, according to our suggestion, on the 4. Feb. 162 A.D.), seems highly probable by its correlation to the "Olmec 2" calendar. We will conclude this chapter with a further phrase by Coe (1962: 94): "Since both dates [of Stela C of Très Zapotes and of the Tuxtla Statuette] fall in the Late Formative and were found within the Olmec 'heartland', it is not unlikely that Olmec literati invented the Long Count and perhaps also developed certain astronomical observations with which the Maya are usually credited." To which we would add: and it is probable that the Olmec philosophers also elaborated the alter ego animal belief. 2.4 The Alter Ego Concept in the Aztec Empire In the previous chapters we discussed the alter ego animal concept as the result of a historical encounter (probably in Olmec culture ambit) be- tween the belief in the guardian spirit (sometimes called also "individual totemism") and the divina- tory calendar that, at a conceptual level, was the encounter between man's mystic personal identi- fication with animal species and the abstract idea of man's predetermined destiny. In principle, fol- lowing this reasoning, we would expect to find the alter ego concept anywhere; these two ele- ments are present (individual totemism and divi- natory calendar). This, however, as we shall see later, is not true. This model's first element, the "totemic" identification with animals, exists as a Pan-American substratum. Hultkrantz (1979: 141, 143) writes: "The oldest stratum of religion, then, is represented by the conceptualizations and rites of the hunters." "The master of animals appears to lie behind the development of the guardian spirit of the individual hunter ... the majority of spirits in the religious world of the hunter are as a matter of course given animal shape." The model's second element, the divinatory calendar, was present in all Mesoamerican high cultures. On this basis we should expect to find the alter ego animal concept also in the Aztec culture. But, according to the archaeological and historiographie testimonies the belief in the alter ego animal was probably absent amongst the Nahuas in the 16th Century. I. Signorini (personal communication) affirms: "When the Aztecs developed their cul- ture, they rarely used the artistic motive of half man/half animal." But, above all, it is according to the reports of the Spanish chroniclers in the 16th century that modern studies on the theme have generally excluded the possibility that the alter ego animal concept could be known by pre-Columbian Nahuas. Signorini and Lupo (1989: 40) write: As we see, in the panorama of concepts relevant to the tonalli of the 16th century Nahuas the idea of the companion animal does not appear though it constitutes the main element of the although transient, controversial, but very widespread cul- tural complex known by the name of tonalism.4 At this point of the paper we will not endeavor to outline the limitations and gaps in the Spanish chroniclers' reports. However, it is important to remember that Sahagun and Molina, the two major historiographers in that period, based their works almost exclusively on data issued from the dom- inant classes of the Aztec society and therefore almost exclusively referred to the official ideology of the Aztec empire, ignoring the subaltern classes' concept of the world. However, for the time being, we will consider only the affirmation of Seler, Foster, and their followers, according to whom the alter ego animal concept was absent amongst pre-Columbian Nahuas. The fundamental question in this perspective is: why and from where did the alter ego animal concept reach the Nahuas in the postconquest period? We propose instead that the fundamental question to be asked regarding the historical reconstruction of the alter ego belief 4 See Foster 1944; Aguirre Beltrán 1973; Durand et Durand- Forest 1970; Pitt-Rivers 1970; Tranfo 1979. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="14">458 Josef Paz amongst the Nahuas should be another one. In the previous chapters we said: 1) The alter ego animal concept is the result of the encounter between elements of the belief in guardian spirits and of the divinatory calendar. 2) This encounter took place in Preclassical times, in the Olmec culture ambit, perhaps already during the first millennium B. C. 3) The Olmec culture, with its religion and artis- tic style, influenced the whole Mesoamerica and, therefore, also pre-Columbian Nahuas (probably through Mayan and Zapotec mediation) spreading the use of the divinatory calendar and, therefore, also the animal alter ego concept in vast zones. 4) The spread of American autochthonous ideological elements right after the Spanish conquest seems improbable. We believe that, on this basis, the fundamental question regarding the historical reconstruction of the alter ego belief amongst the Nahuas is: why and who rejected the alter ego belief from the Aztec religion in a period preceding the Spanish conquest? (and not, as Seler and Foster ask: why and from where does this belief reach the Nahua culture in a period following the conquest?). This incorrect question (in our opinion mainly because it constitutes the starting point of the historical re- construction of the alter ego animal belief amongst the Nahuas) is necessarily given an incorrect an- swer: ". . . this belief was not registered in the Highland during the conquest times, and its ori- gin seems to lead to the Mesoamerican southeast cultures. The encounter between the alter ego an- imal belief and the habit of establishing through the tonalamatl (the book of days) the day sign, the individual name, and destiny . . . should have brought, in first colonial times, to the identification of the companion animal with the symbols, mainly zoomorphical, of the ritual calendar days (tonalpo- hualli)." (Signorini e Lupo 1989: 40). We believe that, only after having understood the reason why the Aztecs (before the conquest) removed from their official ideology (which is the only one about which we have historiographie information) the alter ego animal concept, the following question can become relevant: why and from where did the belief in the alter ego appear among the post- conquest Nahuas (or better, in our model context: why and from where did this belief "reappear" among the postconquest Nahuas?), constituting the starting point for Seler and Foster? We shall deal with this second question in the following chapter. Here, we shall try to answer the first question: Why did the pre-Columbian Aztecs reject the alter ego animal belief from their ideology? Lopez Austin (1980/1: 98) writes about the Aztec ideological system concerning the human body concepts: "En este sistema, como en el res- to del complejo ideológico, se proyecta Ia forma de dominación dei aparato gubernamental sobre Ias comunidades propietarias de la tierra." On the basis of the above statement we should interpret also the presence/absence of the alter ego animal belief in a "political key" as, more or less, a reflection of the Aztec group leaders' interests. Lopez Austin, regarding the religious ideology as a political control instrument in the hands of Aztec sovereigns, adds: "En términos générales puede afirmarse que el grupo en el poder, más que a propiciar una violenta inovación de Ias concep- ciones populares, tendia a desarrollarlas, rearti- cularlas a Ias variantes situaciones, cargarlas de nuevos contenidos, reinterpretarlas, aprovechando ai máximo una tradición cultural para satisfacer ... los crecientes requerimientos de una estruetu- ra sociopolítica cada vez más compleja" (472 f.). Adjusting our model of the historical vicissitude of the alter ego animal amongst the Aztecs to Lopez Austin's perspective, we propose the fol- lowing hypothesis: The Aztecs, and likewise all other Mesoamerican cultures, originally inherited (indirectly) from the Olmecs the ideological intel- lectual complex of beliefs and calendar practices (through Mayan or Zapotec mediation). But, at a certain point, maybe even from the beginning, the alter ego animal concept was removed from this acquired ideological complex according to Lopez Austin's perspective: ". . . para satisfacer ... los crecientes requerimientos de una estruetura sociopolítica cada vez más compleja." In other words, the alter ego concept was not suitable to the ideological frame of the highly centralized and coercive politics of the Aztec empire. To have an idea of this centralized and coercive politics, we go back again to Lopez Austin: "El grupo privilegiado obtenía el grueso del tributo en forma colectiva, fundando su derecho en la retribución como diri- gente de Ia sociedad global. Quedaban así fusiona- dos el aparato gubernamental, el grupo privilegia- do y el complejo de los linajes gobernantes. Todo este organismo dominante estaba personificado en el tlatoani, senor supremo que hacía descansar su poder en su vínculo con la divinidad. El tlatoani distribuía la tierra, regia el culto que propiciaba Ia produeción agrícula y dirigia Ias actividades militares. Su actividad principal tendia a mantener el orden social en el que los explotados contribuían ai sostenimiento de los gobernantes, más por Ia idea de Ia existência de una obligación 'natural,' fundada en el orden divino, que por Ia imposición forzada" (12). To this centralized and coercive Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="15">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 459 political system the Aztecs, therefore adjusted a no less centralized and coercive ideological religious one: ". . . los rituales propiciatórios de la lluvia, la salud general del centro de población, el manejo del calendário agrícola-cerimonial y el conocimen- to del calendário de los destinos estaban a cargo de un sacerdócio que formaba parte del gubierno central. . . . Aqui aparecen ya la graves medidas coercitivas en contra de los morosos. Adernas, era una contribución de tal magnitud . . . que redudaba en beneficio del grupo en el poder, considerado como único capaz de dirigir los esplendorosos, complejos y frecuentes ritos" (83 f.). Undoubtedly, in this framework there is no place for such a highly individual belief, so in- dependent from the collective, so "democratic," i.e., a belief according to which every man is directly connected with the supernatural through his personal representative living in this "celestial" sphere: his alter ego animal. This is an unbearable idea for the Aztec dominant class, which consid- ered its tlatoani as the head of a complex and centralized religious system, the legitimate mean of communication with the gods, the only one able to effectuate exchanges with the supernatural, guaranteeing protection, prosperity, and health to his people. This means that the same concept of the individual's fate was reinterpreted according to this new centralized, coercive ideology. In fact, instead of many destiny animal companions, the various alter ego animals, individually and specif- ically attributed to all members of society, we find in the Aztec religion a supreme god of destiny: "Tezcatlipoca ... the invisible god, the protector of magicians, the god of providence and destiny" (Hultkrantz 1979: 261) - a human destiny that was practically and ideologically controlled by the tlatoani and his priests, or better, to use Lopez Austin's words (1980/1: 87): "Quedo dicho que el aparato gubernamental se había apropriado de los más importantes instrumentos de domínio ide- ológico. Entre ellos se encontraba el conocimiento y manejo dei calendário de los destinos." Summarizing, with Lopez Austin's help, we pointed out the centralized and coercive political structure (supported by an ideological one, as well centralized and coercive) of the Aztec state. Such a highly individual and "democratic" belief as the alter ego one can in no way be part of this ideo- logical framework, since it allows any individual a direct connection to the supernatural and a per- sonal destiny determined from the beginning of this connection and independently of the tlatoani and his politico-religious apparatus. We deem that, because of this, the dominant class in the Aztec empire (the pipiltin) rejected from its ideological system (formed according to its political interests) the alter ego animal concept (especially regard- ing the popular masses - the macehualtiri) and substituted it with that of the tonalli: the indi- vidual destiny established by means of the "to- nalamatl," controlled by the priests. As previously seen (Lopez Austin 1980/1: 472 f.), the Aztec ide- ology had not been created in a vacuum and it always represented a certain development, articu- lation, and readjustment of old values, exploiting to the maximum a préexistent cultural tradition to ideologically control the popular masses trying to offend minimally their religious sentiments. In this perspective the Aztec tonalli was elaborated on the basis of the ancient belief in the alter ego animal and was readjusted to the new political and ideological reality desired by the Aztec regime. This new ideology could have been used as an efficient coercive instrument only if accepted, even partially, by the popular masses - the coercive objects. This means that at least some trace of the old alter ego concept should have persisted in the new Aztec ideology. We find this trace of the old alter ego animal concept in the image of the beliefs in the death destiny: through death people were transformed into various animals. Lopez Austin (1980/1: 378) approaches this belief to the type of tonalism registered in various Maya groups: "La division de la suerte de entidades anímicas al transformarse en distintos animales, de acuerdo con la position social dei indivíduo, hace pen- sar en las actuates concepciones del tonalismo en grupos mayas, que afirman que existe un vínculo estrecho entre cada ser humano y un animal, su 'tona', y que la categoria de este varia de acuerdo con la importância del indivíduo en la comuni- dad . . . Lo anterior liga Io dicho por Mendieta con las creencias de los nahuas contemporâneos, que atribuyen la forma animal del fantasma al tipo de 'sombra': una 'sombra' pesada de una persona muerta aparece como fantasma burro a perro; una 'sombra' liviana, como fantasma rata o chivo. A reserva de volver sobre este tema, puede observarse que existen congruência entre Ias concepciones de 'tona.9,' tonalli' y 'sombra'." Therefore, the man's tonalli (destiny), practically representing during his life the zodiacal sign of his birth, becoming an "animic entity" within his body and determining his character (and therefore also his destiny during life), became after death a certain supernatural animal that recalls the alter ego animal. The Aztec regime, therefore, allowed its subjects to establish a direct contact with this supernatural animal only after death, while, in the Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="16">460 Josef Paz old alter ego belief, people could enjoy this con- tact also and especially during life. At this point, we hold already what we consider a reasonably complete picture of the possible historical vicissi- tude of the alter ego concept in the Aztec culture, according to which the concept of the alter ego animal initially reached the Aztecs as an integral part of the calendrical beliefs and practices. The development of a complex Aztec state, highly cen- tralized and coercive, entailing a clear distinction between hegemonic classes and popular subaltern classes, required modifications also in the ideologi- cal system (conceived by the Aztecs as an integral part of their governmental apparatus). The alter ego concept was hence adjusted to the new socio- political framework, losing its concrete nature of a supernatural being representing the individual's destiny animal. Thus, this concept was reduced into a zodiacal sign of the individual's day of birth (in the context of the divinatory calendar handled by the priests) and later became an "animic entity" (to use Lopez Austin's expression) - the tonalli - establishing man's "inner heat" and character and therefore his behavior and destiny on earth. Thus, people lost their direct contact with the supernat- ural, receiving in exchange an intermediary and indirect one through the state clergy, placing them at a lower level of a spiritual hierarchy, topped by the tlatoani and his priests who represented man's unique communication channel with the su- pernatural through which it was possible to obtain protection, health, and welfare. Following this logic, the same removal process of the alter ego animal concept from the official ideology should have characterized also the Maya zone in the Postclassic period, when the Maya's relatively "pacific" structures were substituted by other structures of the militant coercive type orig- inating from the central Highland. In fact, Haekel (1952: 161; on the basis of Diego de Landa, author of the "Relation de las cosas de Yucatan," the most important source regarding the Maya of the 16th century) affirms that amongst the Postclassic hegemonic classes of the Maya the belief in the alter ego was absent. On the basis of the available data regarding the Aztec ideology and that of Yucatec-Maya, we might propose a general model for what happened to the alter ego concept in Postclassical Mesoamer- ica: With the development of Postclassical states - huge, centralized structures, hierarchic, militant, and coercive (in comparison with the majority of those of the Classic period) - backed by a religion conceived as an instrument to carry out their politics, the alter ego concept disappeared from the zones adjacent to those politico-religious power centers, or better, were made to disappear by groups being in power in these centers, who wanted to guarantee their monopoly on contacts with the supernatural (an opposite tendency to the "democratic" character of the alter ego ani- mal belief). This model corresponds to Köhler's affirmation (1985: 29) that the dominant presence of the alter ego concept is characteristic in those areas which have played a marginal role in the politics of Mesoamerica. Köhler refers to the Co- lonial period but, basing our argument on Haekel (1952: 161), we believe that this applies also to the Postclassical period in which the difference between dominant and subaltern classes acquired a strong ideological aspect. It created an ideology of the state power different from the popular one. An ideology about which, unfortunately, we have scarce or no material due to the simple fact that the 16th century historiographers of "New Spain" concentrated upon the official religion of the Az- tec state, omitting the popular one. Regarding the religious beliefs of the popular masses - the first true and roughly systematic evidence dates back to a century after the conquest with Ruiz de Alarcón, in which we can find the first real historical in- formation about the alter ego animal belief in the Mexican Highland. When we therefore discuss the presence/absence of the alter ego belief amongst the Mesoamerican peoples of the 16th century, we always have to keep in mind the social class we are referring to. Lopez Austin (1980/1: 472) writes: "El valor de los elementos ideológicos, desde el punto de vista de su correspondência con los intereses y aspiraciones de determinados grupos humanos, no puede estimarse en abstracto. Las circunstancias históricas provocaban Ia pluri- valencia de los elementos ideológicos, y lo que en un momento era favorable para uno de los grupos sociales, en otro podia volverse en su contra." It seems to us that in the history of the alter ego belief studies, reference was hardly made to the social class in which it was present or absent. This is essential especially in regard to the Aztec culture, so highly hierarchic, in which the cosmovision of the dominant classes could not in any way cor- respond to that of the subaltern ones. However, this fact was generally ignored by the majority of scholars who studied tonalism. Seler, Foster, and many others who followed them have often read the Spanish chroniclers in a general key, ignoring the ideological abyss that separated the pipiltin from their subjects and hence, when they did not find in Sahagun and Molina the registration of the alter ego belief, they concluded (erroneously in our Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="17">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 46 1 opinion) that this belief was absent (not only in the official ideology) in the Nahua culture as a whole (including popular masses). This, in our opinion, represents the fundamental error of Seler, Foster, and their followers - on the basis of which they proposed an erroneous model discussing the arrival and formation of the alter ego animal concept in the Mexican Highland only in postconquest times (Signorini e Lupo 1989: 40). What we, indeed, wanted to outline is the importance of the origin of historiographical data from one class or another, the importance of the distinction between domi- nant and subaltern classes. That, in our opinion, changes all about the historical vicissitude of the alter ego belief amongst Postclassical and early Colonial Nahuas (which we will discuss within the following chapter). We will conclude this chapter with Lopez Austin's phrase (1980/1: 195) entitled "El Panorama," referring to the Nahua ideology in regards to the human body, i. e., the context of Mesoamerican high cultures where this ideology has its roots: "Juzguemos el panorama ofrecido: es pobre. Las investigaciones etnográficas contem- porâneas, sobre todo en el área maya, dan indícios de que en la antigüedad existían concepciones más ricas sobre Ias partes dei cuerpo, sus funciones y sus relaciones con el resto del cosmos. [The alter ego animal concept also belongs to it: an animal living in the supernatural sphere in function of the health of the human body to which it is tied, representing the individual strongest bond with the remainder cosmos] . . . Nada semejante quedo registrado en las fuentes históricas; cuando menos nada con esta precision. Pero los datos que apare- cen en este capítulo son suficientes para apoyar la antigua existência de vínculos estrechos entre el macrocosmo y el microcosmo. Futuras inves- tigaciones etnográficas nos podrán proporcionar a los historiadores nuevas bases interpretativas." The model proposed in this chapter, which regards the whole of pre-Columbian Mexico, can be well framed in this affirmation of Lopez Austin. The absence of the alter ego concept in the early chron- iclers ' reports cannot be considered as evidence to its absolute absence in the ideological panorama of pre-Columbian Mexican Highland. On this basis, we find it more than probable that this concept as a private case of the general concept of the human body as a function of the cosmos, was alive and present amongst popular classes, away from the political and religious power centers of the Aztec empire. 2.5 The Belief in the Alter Ego Animal in the Colonial Period In 1629 the priest Ruiz de Alarcón completed his famous "Tratado de las supersticiones ... los indios naturales de esta Nueva Espana" on which he had started working already around 1617 (Coe and Whittaker 1982: 1). Ruiz de Alarcón intro- duced some aspects of the Nahua ideology and medicine which were almost totally ignored by former chroniclers, an he was the first to speak explicitly about the alter ego animal amongst peo- ple of the Mexican Highland. This first historical testimony about the presence of the alter ego con- cept, registered amongst the Nahuas in early 17th century and considered in reference to its absence in the 16th century chroniclers' reports (especially Sahagún und Molina), raised the question: From where and why did the alter ego concept reach the Nahuas in early colonial times? It is followed by the answer (often given by researchers following Foster's model): The alter ego concept reached the Nahuas in early colonial times, probably from southeastern Mesoamerica (Signorini e Lupo 1989: 40). As to the reason why such a peculiar mystical religious element had penetrated, the an- swers were various and manifold. We list some of these: According to Brinton (see Foster 1944: 86) the alter ego concept belonged to a revivalistic cult born in opposition to the Hispano-Catholic op- pression; according to Seler (1980: 82), it was the development of communication and transportation means in the Mesoamerica of the 17th and 18th century that permitted the spread of the alter ego belief in vast zones of Mesoamerica; Durand and Durand-Forest (1970: 340) reckon the destruction of the Aztec sacerdotal class and the abandonment of the divinatory calendar (not before the 17th century) among the possible causes of the appear- ance of the transforming witch (nagual) and the alter ego animal (tonal) figures; Tranfo (1979: 151) explains the significant spread of the alter ego concept in colonial times as a means of cancelling the individual's responsibility for the misfortunes of life, that had become harder and harder under the Spanish dominion. According to Tranfo, the alter ego concept "is a psychic projection in terms of insecurity, a product of a tragically violated cul- ture, the depersonalization of a civilization living under the sign of dependence and that of a constant tension, under the yoke of a secular dominion. It is exactly in the colonial period that the tonal acquired the meaning of a 'companion-animal,' that takes upon itself the ethical-existential charac- teristics of the bearer-individual, transforming the Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="18">462 Josef Paz divinatory research that the prehispanic culture en- trusted to the calendrical symbols in an assumption of responsibility. This in turn becomes, for the in- dividual, the irresponsibility for his own nature and his own destiny power" (151). However, it is not completely clear if the new Spanish masters were crueler and less tolerant than the old Aztec mas- ters, who were famous in the whole Postclassical Mesoamerica for their inhumane cruelty and for their terrible human sacrifices, and who created a terror regime, permanently menacing with bloody sanctions entire populations of ancient Mexico. The condition of these populations, defeated and oppressed by the belligerent Aztecs to whom they had to pay tributes in food, gold, and above all men for sacrifice, does not seem, from a psychological point of view, much better compared with their situation under the colonial dominion. Therefore, following Tranfo's logic we would expect to find the alter ego belief as a means of removing in- dividual responsibility from life's misfortunes al- so amongst the subaltern classes and populations submitted to the Aztec rule - even earlier than the Spanish conquest. Besides, the fact is that all these theories which discuss the spread of the alter ego concept in the early colonial period, as probably arrived from the southeastern regions of Mesoamerica, can- not be well framed in Lopez Austin's affirmation (1980/1: 32), regarding the current similarities in religious concepts of Mesoamerican various popu- lations: "La coincidência es más de tomarse en cuenta si se agrega que es poco probable que taies concepciones se hayan difundido después de la conquista, ya que a partir de ella los pueblos indígenas tuvieron entre si una comunicación más restringida que en la antigüedad." On this basis, Seier and Foster's models speaking of the large spread of the alter ego concept during the be- ginning of colonial times (". . . it unquestionably became much more widespread during this pe- riod" [Foster 1944: 99]) seem improbable. In our opinion, the model we proposed in the previous chapter seems more acceptable: the Aztec domi- nant classes removed the alter ego concept from their official ideology because it was incongruent with their coercive policy. But the popular masses were in a very different sociopolitical situation and, hence, had a different cosmovision and oth- er religious concepts, perhaps including the alter ego animal that continued to exist, maintaining its vitality and adequacy to the religious interests of the oppressed populations (about which we have scarce or no historiographie information before the time of Ruiz de Alarcón). Former chroniclers, es- pecially Sahagun und Molina, concentrated on the study of Aztec official religion, and Lopez Austin himself (1980/1: 7 f.), basing his work on their reports, admits: "Parece, desde el presente, como si todos los antiguos nahuas hubiesen participado exactamente de las mismas concepciones acerca del organismo humano. Es la miopia que producen nuestras limitaciones. Si se debatian los intereses contrários entre dirigentes y dirigidos, entre so- ciedades en expansion y sociedades que sufrian la expansion ajena, entre campesinos, artesanos y comerciantes, entre subgrupos étnicos o de distinto nível tecnológico, no debió de ser homogénea Ia produeción ideológica, y la diversidad de intereses debió de corresponder la de particulares cosmovi- siones que hacían diferentes los coneeptos relati- vos al organismo humano. Por ahora la imagen es asi indistinta y corresponde, mayoritariamente, al producto de la ideologia dominante." According to this, Lopez Austin's perspective, the absence of the alter ego animal from Sahagun' s and Molina's testimonies, seems to be more than acceptable, although it was probably present in the popular religion - a further support for our thesis referring to pre-Columbian existence of the alter ego animal in the Mexican Highland. Up to this point we discussed the survival of the alter ego concept in early colonial times amongst the Nahua at a popular level and its ab- sence amongst dominant classes. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, a similar situation is characteristic of the Maya area. According to Haekel (1952: 161), the alter ego belief seemed to have been absent amongst Yucatec Maya. But this cultural and ideological homogeneity existed just amongst dominant classes. After the conquest the dominant class was eliminated by the Spaniards, but in spite of the Hispano-Catholic acculturation, the people conserved some ancient ideas amongst them also the alter ego concept. Therefore, the Nahua model presenting the alter ego animal ab- sence amongst the dominant class and its presence amongst popular masses, on the basis of Haekel, applies also to the Maya zone of Postclassic and colonial times. According to Köhler (1985: 27) the belief in the alter ego animal ist typically present in the areas of the eastern and western part of the Sierra Madre, the Isthmus, and the Guatemala Highlands. Köhler points out that this means that in historical times the alter ego concept disap- peared from the central zones of Mesoamerican high cultures, while in the peripheral, marginal ones the ancient concepts like the alter ego animal were preserved. According to Köhler' s theory, this was due to the Catholic influence, concentrated on Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="19">The Vicissitude of the Alter Ego Animal in Mesoamerica 463 the old indigenous political power centers (turned into colonial cities) and their surroundings. Such a Catholic influence was less effective in more re- mote regions. This hypothesis does not correspond to Haekel's affirmation (1952: 161), in which the alter ego animal concept was absent amongst the dominant classes of Postclassical Maya, and it ist also unacceptable with regard to the Nahuas, on the basis of the facts present (or, even better, absent) in Sahagun's and Molina's reports. On the basis of these works, representing the most important historical sources available about the Nahua religion of the 16th century, it seems quite certain that the belief in the alter ego animal was absent in the official ideology of the Aztec state even much earlier than the arrival of the Christian missionaries and therefore we cannot attribute its elimination in the ex-Aztec empire centers to the latters' influence. On the basis of the arguments put forward up to now, we would suggest a correction to Foster's and his followers' models and to that of Köhler: The belief in the alter ego animal was present in colonial times in peripheral zones, far from the politico-religious power centers, and was lacking in the latter ones, not because of the acculturation forced by Catholic priests in the early colonial period (as Köhler suggests) but because of the ideological religious oppression operated by the Aztecs themselves, or even, by the elite of the Aztec empire (naturally before the Spanish con- quest), an oppression more effective and signifi- cant in zones close to the state centers and less effective and significant in the peripheral zones. Therefore, we shall not speak of the alter ego appearance amongst Nahuas of the 17th century as a collateral effect of one or another of the new conditions, originated in colonial Mesoamerica (as suggested by Seler, Foster, and their followers), but of its recognition by the Spaniards who only in that period came to know the religious concepts of the popular masses through the work of Ruiz de Alarcón and his informers. With reference to this, it seems that Signorini and Lupo's statement (1989: 51) lacks support: ". . . for the Nahua of Santiago [a village of Sierra de Puebla] the term 'tonal' indicates today essen- tially the counterpart or the animal alter ego of the man, which means a concept apparently foreign to the cultural context of the Highland." 3. Conclusion This paper presents a model embracing a more than 2 000 years old history of the alter ego ani- mal concept, beginning from its birth in the Late Formative in the big centers of the Olmec culture, through its spread in vast Mesoamerican zones up to its current presence in suburban zones, inci- dental in comparison with the Postclassical and then colonial political power centers. A process that in "demological" terms seems to be that of a "descent" in the social dimension: as from Preclas- sical and Classical sacerdotal environments (repre- senting the major intellectual forces in the whole history of pre-Columbian America) the alter ego animal concept spread amongst various and dif- ferent cultures and populations that came under the influence of the high cultures. Postclassical high cultures removed it from their state religions. But, this belief survived amongst popular masses, especially those in zones remote from the politico- religious power centers where it can still be found today at a "cultural relict" phase. On the basis of archaeological and ethnohis- torical data and models, we attempted to show that the alter ego animal belief was alive and present in vast zones of Mesoamerica (including the Mexican Highland) prior to the conquest, and that its origins seem to lead to the Olmec culture. It is true, however, that we do not have an irre- futable proof available neither for the significance of the "half-man/half-animal" motive, imputed by the Olmecs to many of their statues, nor for the presence of the alter ego animal amongst subaltern classes and populations living far from the political power centers of the Postclassical states, nor even for the existence of this belief in the central High- land during the century after the Spanish conquest. However, we believe that the various theories of the birth/development/spread of the belief in the alter ego animal as a brand-new element - foreign to both the Nahua pre-Columbian context and the Hispano-Catholic one that arrived the Mexican Highland in the period following the conquest - cannot be accepted because: 1) On the basis of the criteria elaborated by Lopez Austin (1980/1: 32- 35) the autochthonous origin of the alter ego belief seems almost indubitable; it is present in vast zones of almost the whole Mesoamerica; it is harmoniously integrated with other elements of the indigenous ideological systems, and therefore belongs to the pre-Columbian "ideological unity" of Mesoamerican high cultures and the more prim- itive cultures influenced by them. 2) The funda- mental difference between the alter ego animal (in Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="20">464 Josef Paz the so-called "tonalism") and the guardian spirit (in the sometimes so-called "individual totemism") is man's predetermined destiny concept (generally established according to the date of birth), which does not depend on man's conduct during his life. As long as he lives, he will always have an in- dissoluble tie with his "destiny double" - his alter ego animal. This idea of the individual destiny, predetermined and independent from man's con- duct during life, established according to his date of birth, brings us to the ambit of the calendrical beliefs and practices, born with the invention of the divinatory calendar by the Olmec culture. 3) The artistic motive "half-animal/half-man" togeth- er with the divinatory calendar was born in the Olmec culture in the Late Formative and spread out to all Mesoamerican high cultures. 4) There is a probable continuity that goes from the statues presenting the "half-animal/half-man" or "animal on man" motive of the Formative high cultures, and the belief in the alter ego animal amongst the Indians of today. 5) Nowadays, the belief in the alter ego animal is typically present in marginal zones of the Postclassical high cultures. 6) The Postclassical high cultures elaborated centralized and coercive religio-ideological systems to support their centralized and coercive political structures (in which, we deem, there was no place for such a "democratic" element as the alter ego animal concept). 7) An ideological abyss separated the Aztec state official religion from that of the pop- ular masses. The same is valid also for the zone of the Postclassical Maya. 8) Traces of the alter ego belief existed also in Postclassical official re- ligions. In the Aztec religion there was the belief according to which people were transformed into various animals after death. Regarding the Maya religion of the Postclassical period, we examined a Popol Vuh text that speaks about the two culture heroes, the brothers Hunahpu and Xbalanque who had a cane as an alter ego. 9) According to Lopez Austin the spread of pre-Columbian ideological elements in early postconquest times is very im- probable. Therefore, Seler's and Foster's models, outlining the great spread/development of the alter ego concept in early colonial times, are hard to be accepted. 10) Ruiz de Alarcón registered in the early 17th century the belief in the alter ego animal amongst the Nahua of the central Highland. Ruiz de Alarcón was the first researcher who made a nearly thorough and methodical investigation of the Nahuas' popular beliefs whilst the Spanish chroniclers of the 16th century concentrated on the "official," cultured" religion (Sahagún and Moli- na). On the basis of these data and models, we propose our theory on the birth of the alter ego animal concept in the Olmec culture, during the Late Formative, as a consequence of the encounter between some version of the ancient Pan-Ameri- can belief in animalistic guardian spirits and a new Olmec invention: the divinatory calendar, that at a conceptual level was the convergence between the mystic personal identification man/animal species with the abstract idea of the individual's prede- termined destiny. The alter ego concept, as an integral part of the complex of calendrical beliefs and practices, reached all Mesoamerican high cul- tures and the minor tribal cultures they influenced, spreading out to vast zones of the continent. In the Postclassical period with the development of large, highly centralized, and despotic states, the alter ego animal concept was rejected from the official religions because of its extremely individual, a- collective, and "democratic" character. However, this belief held out in the peripheral zones, far from the politico-religious power centers, where it was registered for the first time (in reference to the central Highland) only in the early 17th century by H. Ruiz de Alarcón who was the first one to con- duct a more or less systematic research on the Na- huas' popular beliefs. It is in these marginal areas (marginal to the politico-religious power centers of the Postclassical states, which became colonial cities after the conquest) where we can still find today the ancient belief in the alter ego animal. Further field research is, however, necessary to gain a new interpretative basis for a more reliable confirmation of this theory. References Cited Aguirre Beltrán, Gonzalo 1973 Medicina y magia.
