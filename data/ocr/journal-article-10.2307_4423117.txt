<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REVIEW OF ACQUISITIONS 1963-70 OF WESTERN ASIATIC ANTIQUITIES (I) BABYLONIA THE area of southern Iraq which from the early second millennium B.C. onwards was known as Babylonia, united the two regions which in the texts of the third millennium are distinguished as Sumer in the south and Akkad in the north. The earliest texts that can be deciphered reveal the presence of both the Sumerian and (Semitic) Akkadian languages, as well as other elements which do not belong to either. It is therefore hazardous to assign prehistoric remains to any particular ethnic group. At around 3000 B.C. the first inscribed objects began to appear in Babylonia though no connected sense can be obtained from them. The time of the emergence of writing which they introduced falls in what is conventionally labelled the Jamdat Nasr period (c. 3000-2 800 B.c.). A number of new acquisitions belong to this period, including: a limestone bowl with carved decoration of oxen and flowers (134741, ht. 5- I cm.), formerly, like several other acquisitions, in the collection of Captain E. G. Spencer-Churchill of Northwick Park (hereafter designated Spencer-Churchill); the spout of a stone vase in the form of an animal head (134839; ht. 2-8 cm.); thirteen amulets in the form of cows (134698, I35238; hts. 3-6 and 3'3 cm.), cow's heads (134420-1; hts. 2.5 and 2-4 cm.), sheep (134419, 135243; hts. 2.8 and 1-6 cm.), a pig (134697; ht. 2.5 cm.), birds (134426, 134429, 134840; hts. 2-6, 0-7, and 4`2 cm.), fish (135239, 135241; lengths 4-5 and 4-6 cm.), a stylized human (134425; ht. 2-8 cm.); and two wand or sceptre heads (134423-4; hts. I.9 and I-9 cm.). By the Jamdat Nasr period sizeable towns with monumental buildings already existed, and in the following Early Dynastic period (c. 2800-2370 B.C.) some of these became what may fairly be called cities, the centres of city states. The latter part of this period is already well known from the discoveries in the 'Royal Tombs' at Ur, and some of the new acquisitions further illustrate it. A notable example is the limestone statue of a man dressed in a sheep's-fleece kilt, with his hands folded in the attitude of prayer (134300; ht. 29.3 cm.; P1. LIII (a)).' This was formerly in the private collection of Sir Jacob Epstein. Other sculptures of this period are a finely carved limestone head of a bearded man with inlaid eyes (now missing) and sockets for inlay in the curls of the beard (135427; ht. 8 cm.), a bull's head of limestone (13548I; ht. 12-5 cm.), comparable in style with the gold bull's head which decorates the lyre of Pu-abi,z and the limestone head of a woman with an ornamental hair style, said to be from Kish (135155; ht. 3- 8 cm.). A small statuette of dark stone, depicting a man with shaven head and clasped hands kneeling with one knee raised, is also probably to be dated to this time (134838; ht. 4"4 cm.). One of the art forms of this period, of which many 13'</page><page sequence="2">examples were found at Ur, is the incised inlay plaque for use in mosaic work. The Museum has acquired two new examples, one of limestone showing a man, said to be from Kish (135154; ht. 8 -4 cm.), and one of shell, showing two crossed onagers (134841; ht. 2-8 cm.). One of the characteristics of the period of the early city states is the fact that most official inscriptions were written in Sumerian. In c. 2370 B.c. a new dynasty was founded in the city of Agade, or Akkad, by Sargon, and the period of this dynasty, called the Akkad period, was characterized by official inscriptions in the Akkadian language. One of the new acquisitions is part of a limestone mace- head with a dedicatory inscription of Naram-Sin, the grandson of Sargon (134905; ht. I9.2 cm.; Pl. LIII (b)).3 Also of this period are seven cuneiform tablets inscribed with administrative texts (134929-35), the last presented by Mr. J. Turnbull. The period of the Akkadian dynasty was brought to an end by tribal invasions from the mountains. The next great period of Babylonian civilization saw a return to Sumerian as the official language under the rulers of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2 I 13-2006 B.C.), who brought most of Sumer and Akkad under their control. The new acquisitions from this period include a large duck-shaped stone weight (134301; 1. 36-7 cm.; P1. LIII (c)), presented by Colonel A. S. Capper, D.S.O. The weight of this object, 35 lb. 7 oz. (about 16 kg.), probably repre- sents 30 minas. All the other objects are cuneiform tablets: one letter, presented by Dr. E. Sollberger (134633)4 and nine administrative texts (I34878,5 pre- sented by Mr. R. Falkiner; 134912; 134953-5, these three presented by Mr. H. L. White; 134968; 135o66, presented by Mrs. G. E. Edmeades; and 13521 1, presented by Mrs. H. H. Figulla in memory of her husband, who served as a special cuneiform assistant in the Department from 1938 to 1964). The Third Dynasty of Ur was ended by defection and finally invasion, and the succeeding period, when new dynasties, dominated by Amorites from the west and Elamites from the east, came to power, is called, in general, the Old Babylonian period (c. 2000-1600 oB.c.), since the greatest dynasty of the time, of which Hammurapi is the most famous king, was the First Dynasty of Babylon (1894-1595 B.c.). A number of recent acquisitions belong to this period. These include three terracotta figurines, two of naked women (134843; ht. II-3 cm.; P1. LIv (a); and 135127; ht. 7-8 cm.), and one of a dog (133030; ht. IO-5 cm.), and seven terracotta plaques, one of a naked bearded man holding a flowing vase (133029; ht. II cm.; Pl. LIv (b)), the last two presented by Mrs. A. N. Vetts in memory of her husband Major L. M. Vetts, M.C., one of a naked woman (134739; ht. 6-2 cm.), presented by Mr. E. G. McLoughlin, two of women, and one of a horned figure wearing richly ornamented robes (I34702; ht. I I cm.; I35749; ht. 6.5 cm.; 135148; ht. II cm.), one of a figure seated on a throne 132</page><page sequence="3">between two standing figures (134690; ht. 6-3 cm.), and part of the back of a model throne, decorated with goats (134689; ht. 5-5 cm.). Four administrative cuneiform texts (134966-7, 134972, 135067), the last presented by Mrs. G. E. Edmeades, and one docket (134971) also belong to this period. Possibly also of this period is a limestone statuette representing the upper part of a man carrying a jar-container, suspended on his back by a thong round his forehead (134737; ht. 6-7 cm.). This figurine was presented by Mr. E. G. McLoughlin. The period from about i 6oo to I I00oo B.C. in Mesopotamia, when people from the eastern mountains, the Kassites, held the power, is represented among the new acquisitions only by cylinder seals.6 During the first millennium B.C., Babylonia was increasingly overshadowed politically by Assyria to the north, until the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C. The Babylonians helped in the destruction of Assyria, and this event introduced the Neo-Babylonian period in the strict sense (612-539 B.C.), though in a broad sense the Neo-Babylonian period can be said to have run from about I00ooo to 500 B.c. To this time belongs a marble mace- or sceptre-head (134713; ht. 5'9 cm.), said to be from Abu-Habba, ancient Sippar, with a three-line cuneiform inscription identifying it as the property of Nabu-nasir, son of Bel-iddina. Also of this time are a terracotta horseman from Ur (134302; ht. 13-6 cm.), presented by Miss D. Rayner-Wood, a glazed jar from Ur (135283; ht. 6. 8 cm.), presented by Mrs. G. E. Edmeades, and three cuneiform contract tablets (134969-70, I34973). Also possibly of this period is the upper part of a terracotta figurine of a boy with a bare torso, his hands clasped before him, and a circular ornament on his forehead (134696; ht. 6-3 cm.). In 539 B.C. Babylon fell to Cyrus the Persian and there followed two centuries of Achaemenid rule. The last Achaemenid king in Babylonia was Darius III, whose defeat at the hands of Alexander the Great successively at Issus (333 B.C.) and Arbela (331 B.C.), introduced the Hellenistic period. On Alexander's death his empire was divided among his followers and western Asia fell to Seleucus who founded a dynasty. From this, the Seleucid period, comes one of the new acquisitions, a fragment of a cuneiform tablet containing a ritual against the ill effect of eclipses of the moon, and dated to the equivalent of the year 172 B.C. (134696). Soon after this time (c. 140 B.C.), the Babylonian part of the Seleucid dominions fell to the Parthians, a people who had been expanding for about a century in Iran, and now began a period of rule in Babylonia which lasted for nearly four centuries. They were finally overthrown c. A.D. 225 by Ardashir the founder of the Sassanian dynasty which continued in control until the Muslim invasions of the seventh century A.D. Probably to the early Sassanian period, c. A.D. 400, belong two rolled-up lead strips inscribed by a fine-pointed instrument with incantation texts in Mandaean, a form of Aramaic (134699-700; widths 4"3 and 4.-2 cm.).7 Of a somewhat later date, c. A.D. 600, is a pottery bowl 133 s</page><page sequence="4">with a Mandaean incantation inscribed in ink in a spiral on the inside, and with a drawing of a demonic creature on the outside (135438; diam. 20-9 cm.).8 ASSYRIA Ancient Assyria lay to the north of Babylonia on the river Tigris, and in the periods of Babylonian power was strongly influenced by it. The earliest of the new acquisitions from this area come from a time when Assyria was dominated by its western neighbour the Hurrian state of Mitanni. These are fragments of a polychrome glass vessel of the fifteenth to fourteenth century B.C. from the excavations of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq at Tell Rimah (134901 ;9 P1. LIv (c)). The vessel was constructed by fusing together a large number of short sections of glass rods of different colours, laid against each other so that their ends produced a pattern. These form an important addition to the Depart- ment's collection of glass since they come from a time not much later than the earliest glass vessels known.'0 The vessel of which these fragments formed a part was probably a tall goblet with squat foot,I a shape well known in pottery, and characteristic of Mitanni. Cultural contacts with Babylonia at this time are demonstrated by the dis- covery of glass fragments in a comparable technique at Dur-Kurigalzu, the Kassite capital. Three other fragments of glass from Tell Rimah are also of about this date. These are the lower part of a goblet with button base (I 34902a; ht. 6-9 cm.; Pl. LIv (d)), a fragment from the rim of a goblet, possibly the same one (I349o2b; ht. 2-6 cm.), and a fragment from the neck and shoulder of a bottle (134902c; ht. 3-9 cm.), all formed on a sand core and decorated with coloured threads, probably originally yellow and white, combed to produce zigzag and festoon patterns.'2 By about the latter part of the fourteenth century B.C., Assyria had gained effective independence, and grew in power during the following three centuries, known as the middle Assyrian period. The end of the second millennium B.C. was a disturbed time, when Mesopo- tamia was infiltrated, and indeed in some sense invaded by Aramaeans, a Western people whose language came to be widely used by the Assyrians and became the diplomatic lingua franca of the Achaemenian Empire. The disruptions of the Aramaean incursion were followed by the period of the Assyrian Empire, also known as the Neo-Assyrian period (c. 00ooo-612 B.C.). Probably the best- known art form of the Assyrians is the sculptured bas relief of which the British Museum holds an unrivalled collection. Among the new acquisitions are a number of fragments of reliefs which either join, or belong to the same scenes as sculptures already in the Museum. They all come from Kuyunjik, the citadel I34</page><page sequence="5">mound of the ancient Assyrian capital, Nineveh; five from the palace of Sen- nacherib (704-68 I B.C.), and twelve from the palace of Ashurbanipal (668-627 B.C.). One of the Sennacherib reliefs (134862; ht. 21 cm.), presented by the Leeds City Museum, shows two men carrying logs over their shoulders, and together with another fragment already in the Museum, which it joins (93019), forms part of a sequence of scenes showing the king supervising the moving, on wooden sledges and log rollers, of colossal stone bulls for the adornment of his palace. This series was badly damaged,'3 and included several files of men carrying log rollers, so it is not possible to place them precisely.'4 Another Sennacherib relief (I35200; ht. 64 cm.; P1. LV (a)) shows the upper half of a bearded Assyrian guard holding a shield and spear, and came from a series, part of which has been in the Museum for over a century,'5s which decorated a ramp, connecting Sennacherib's Palace and the Temple of Ishtar. It, together with others among the recent acquisitions (I35I97-206), was formerly in the possession of the Royal Geographical Society where they were displayed on the walls of the ground-floor corridor. These pieces originally belonged to Sir Henry Rawlinson who had them in his library, and were presented to the Royal Geographical Society by the widow of his eldest son, Henry Seymour, General Lord Rawlinson, as a memorial to him on his death in 1925.16 The remaining new Sennacherib reliefs depict Assyrian archers shooting arrows to the right (135198-9, 135205; hts. 62-5, 60.5, and 67.5 cm.).'7 They must originally have belonged to a connected series to which it is possible that a small fragment already in the Museum belonged.'8 These four pieces are now exhibited in the Lachish Room but the campaign which they depict remains unidentified. Three of the new fragments from the Palace of Ashurbanipal depict soldiers and captive civilians against a background of palm trees (135201, 135202 (P1. Lv (b)), 135203; hts. 40, 41, and 39 cm.).'9 They probably belong to a series showing the defeat in 650 B.C. of the king of Babylon, Ashurbanipal's brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, who had rebelled against him. This series is already repre- sented by two slabs,20 which came to the Museum in 18 56. The remaining fragments all probably belong to scenes illustrating Ashurban- ipal's campaigns against Elam, the area in south-west Persia of which Susa was the main city. One relief shows seven archers in feather head-dresses advancing to the right (I 35204; ht. 41 cm.).2' It joins a slab already in the Museum collec- tions,22 and both probably belong to the same sequence as a third fragment23 which also shows archers with feather head-dresses. R. D. Barnett has argued that these warriors form part of a victory parade approaching Ashurbanipal, who is shown on two famous slabs (I24920, I24922)24 feasting in a garden with his queen, to the sound of music, after the defeat of the Elamites. Barnett has further proposed to identify these wearers of feathered headgear as Persians who had taken part in the battle on the side of the Assyrians.zs '35</page><page sequence="6">Most of the other new fragments of reliefs from the Palace of Ashurbanipal also belong to this sequence. Six of these (I351 15-20) were formerly in the possession of Oscott College near Birmingham.26 They depict a harpist (I3 5 15; ht. 25 cm.), two pipe players (1351 16; ht. 14-8 cm.; 1351 17; ht. 14-6 cm.), and three attendants (135 118-20; hts. 36, 21-5, and 13-2 cm.), and clearly belong in the garden scene itself (P1. LV (c)).27 Two other fragmentary reliefs belong to another scene of a campaign in Elam, which shows the siege of the city of Hamanu. One of them (13438 6; ht. 15 cm.), joins a slab which has been long in the Museum,28 in the context of which it shows four captives being guarded by Assyrian soldiers in front of the beleaguered city,29 and the other (135197; ht. 28.5 cm.), which shows two figures on either side of a large cooking-pot, very probably belongs to some other part of the same scene.30 Another new acquisition gives a good example of the monumental cuneiform script of the Assyrian Empire period. It is a section of five lines from an inscrip- tion of Sargon (722-705 B.C.), describing his main conquests, and the building and adornment of his Palace at Dur-Sharrukin, modern Khorsabad (135206; ht. 34 cm.; P1. LV (d)).31 Sculpture in the round is represented by the small head of a snarling lion in blue frit (134684; ht. 5-2 cm.; P1. LV (e)) of the ninth to eighth century B.c., which probably formed the finial to the arm of a chair. Also of this period are two terracotta plaques, one showing the creature known as a Musbu'h u (Sumerian mus-bu'u, 'terrible serpent') which had a horned snake's head, a scaled snake's body, a lion's fore feet, an eagle's hind feet, and a scorpion's tail (134738; ht. 5.2 cm.; P1. LV (f)), and the other showing a winged, eagle- headed human figure of the type familar in the Assyrian bas reliefs of the ninth century B.C. (133034; ht. 14'5 cm.; P1. LVI (a)). A pottery flask with traces of a petal pattern in white glaze on the shoulder and a green glaze ground (I3 5188; ht. Io.3 cm.) is of a type known from eighth to seventh century B.C. contexts at the early Assyrian capital Assur. This example comes from Ziwiye, a site about twenty-five miles east of Sakkiz in Kurdistan. This was in an area occupied in the early first millennium B.C. by the Mannaeans (biblical 'Minni', Jer. 51: 27), but during the seventh century it passed into the hands of the Medes. It is possible that this vessel was locally made, in the Assyrian style.32 The Assyrians have long been known as skilled in the making of glass,33 and further examples of this craft, excavated by the British School of Archaeology in Iraq at Fort Shalmaneser, Nimrud, are among the new acquisi- tions (134893-900). These include a plaque for inlay, decorated with a winged sphinx in black and blue paint (134900; P1. LVI (C))34 and a number of fragments of vessels, some with cut decoration, and one with small mosaic glass squares set in a cut groove (134899).35 136</page><page sequence="7">BAHRAIN AND THE PERSIAN GULF During the later third and the early part of the second millennium B.c., there is evidence of trade between southern Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civiliza- tion. No doubt some part of this was conducted by sea, down the Persian Gulf, past the promontory of Oman, and along the Persian and Baluchi coast to the mouth of the Indus. A less far flung seaborne trade, from Mesopotamia down the Gulf, was being carried on long before this, and some of the new acquisitions demonstrate this. A number of potsherds of the Ubaid culture which flourished in Mesopotamia in the early fourth millennium B.C., come from Al-Dawsiriyah on the Arabian mainland opposite Bahrain (135310, 135312-20; P1. LVI (b)). Associated with them was a fragment of wall plaster with the impression of cords on the back (I3531 I). This is closely comparable to similar fragments found by Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur, and they provide evidence, as he pointed out, that the Ubaid people lived in huts built of reeds fastened together with laced cords and covered with mud plaster.36 The discovery of this wall plaster at Al-Daw- siriyah is of particular interest because it shows that the Ubaid people must have settled there, no doubt for the purposes of trade, and that the pottery was not just the product of return expeditions. This collection has been presented by Mrs. Bert Golding, who has also presented two cylindrical pottery beads from a burial ground in the same area, possibly also of Ubaid date (135321-2). Two pottery vessels (I34314, 134636, the former containing beads and a copper pin; P1. LvI (d)), which show clear connections with the pottery of the Jamdat Nasr period in Mesopotamia (c. 3000 B.c.), were discovered at Buraimi in Oman, showing a further extension of the earlier trade contacts.37 They have been presented by Corporal S. Falla of the Oman Scouts and Warrant Officer E. Buck of the RASC respectively. One of the main entrep6ts of the trans-Persian Gulf trade was the island of Bahrain which lies off the Arabian coast to the north-west of the Qatar peninsula. In i88o Captain E. L. Durand published an account of the antiquities of Bahrain, and in an accompanying note Sir Henry Rawlinson proposed its identification with the Dilmun of the cuneiform texts. Dilmun or Tilmun appears in the economic and historical texts as a trading centre, and in the early mythological texts as a demi-paradise. Sporadic investigations have been made in subsequent years, including exca- vations in 1925 by the British School of Archaeology in Egypt under E. Mackay which yielded some antiquities now in the British Museum.38 The identification with Tilmun still seems probable. Since the Second World War Danish excavations on the island have revealed a developed culture, represented in particular by a stone-built temple, which was in use in the late third and the early second millennium B.c., and it is probably to this period that a tomb group 137</page><page sequence="8">among the new acquisitions is to be dated. This group, which includes vessels of pottery and bronze, and a miniature bronze goat (1351 27-41),39 has been presented by Mrs. E. P. Jefferson, who discovered it in 1968 at Hamala North in central Bahrain. SYRIA AND PHOENICIA It is convenient to treat as one area the whole zone lying between Assyria and the northern part of the east Mediterranean coast, an area occupied today by the states of Syria and Lebanon. This area was not always a cultural unit, the coastal strip, Phoenicia par excellence, looking largely to the east Mediterranean and Egypt, and the inland region looking to Mesopotamia, but the cultural strands are often difficult to isolate and distinguish. In the Prehistoric period the influence of the early civilization of Mesopotamia is most evident, and five anthropomorphic figurines of clay (1348 57; ht. 5- I cm.) and limestone (134858, 135472-74; hts. 5.1, 3.8, 3'4, and 2.9 cm.) probably represent outliers of the Halaf period which flourished in the fifth millennium in northern Mesopotamia. During the third millennium there was developed city life in many parts of Syria, and it is probably to the end of this period, c. 2000 B.C., at a time when the urban centres were suffering from the nomadic incursions that marked the end of the Early Bronze Age, that a copper figurine of a bearded man wearing a kilt (135034; ht. 25-5 cm.; P1. Lvi (e)) belongs. This figurine, which probably originally held a weapon, is of a type represented by several examples, all of which seem to have originated in the Lebanon mountains near Gezzine.40 Another bronze figurine representing a woman, perhaps a war goddess, holding an axe and a shield probably also belongs to this period, or slightly later in the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (134987; ht. 17' 8 cm.). Two small bronze figurines of deities, one female with a child (134709; ht. 7-4 cm.) and one male holding a vessel in his outstretched hand (134710; ht. 6-4 cm.), are probably to be dated in the Middle Bronze Age, c. nineteenth to eighteenth century B.C. From the early part of the Late Bronze Age, c. fifteenth century B.C., comes another bronze figurine, the lower part unfortunately broken away, which depicts a male deity with conical cap, bare torso, and ridged kilt, secured by a waist band from which hang two cords(I134627; ht. 2 i cm.; P1. LVI (f)).41 It is unfortunately not possible to identify any of these figurines with the gods known from the texts since they have no recognizable features of dress or equipment such as the horned head-dress and forked lightning of Baal-Hadad. Two other bronze figurines, probably of the Early Iron Age, c. ninth to eighth century B.C., do not represent deities. One (134708; ht. 9 cm.) is simply a naked woman with arms spread and the other (135070; ht. 26 cm.; P1. LvI (g)), which shows a naked 138</page><page sequence="9">woman holding her breasts, stands on a tripod, and must have been a decorative element in some kind of stand. The Bronze Age in the Near East had ended with widespread disruptions brought about by folk movements from the north. The Hittite Empire in Asia Minor was destroyed and elements of the population were displaced as refugees to Syria, where many cities had been destroyed by the same agency. The conse- quent weakness of the settled centres was also taken as the occasion for desert nomads, the Aramaeans, to move in. The early first millennium B.C. in Syria was therefore a time of Neo-Hittite, Aramaean, and Phoenician city states, the Phoenicians being concentrated mainly on the coast. All three of these ethnic groups are represented by new acquisitions. The Neo- Hittites continued to use one of the forms of writing employed by their precursors in Asia Minor, the pictographic script known as Hieroglyphic Hittite, which was the vehicle of an Indo-European language, known as Luwian. Among the objects excavated at the Assyrian capital, Nimrud, were a number of fragments of cup-shaped objects of shell (133009-23, 134325), some of them inscribed in Hieroglyphic Hittite with the name 'King Urhilina'. Urhilina is known from other Hieroglyphic Hittite inscriptions as well as from the Assyrian inscriptions where his name is spelled Irhuleni and Urhileni, as a ruler of the Syrian city of Hamath in the ninth century B.c. It seems clear, therefore, that these were part of the property of Urhilina, taken as booty to Assyria, perhaps by Shalmaneser in c. 850 B.C. Their purpose is uncertain but a plausible view is that they were musical clappers.42 From the Aramaean city of Sam'al, the modern Zincirli, comes an important silver ingot, of the eighth century B.c., inscribed with the name 'Bar-rakib, son of Panammu' (134918; Pl. LvII (a)).43 These two names illustrate the mixed character of the population, for while Bar-rakib is Semitic Aramaic, 'Son of the (chariot) rider' or something of the kind, Panammu, probably short for Panam- muwa, is made up of Anatolian, possibly Luwian, elements.44 This ingot has been long known, a photograph having already been published in 1943, together with two other similar examples which had been found in the German excava- tions at Zincirli,45 though the original was not at that time available. Of the excavated examples, one is damaged, but the other is virtually complete and weighs 497'38 g. This may be taken as a rough guide to the original weight of the damaged Museum example, which now weighs 402-90 g., and, assuming this to be correct, it can be interpreted as representing a mina made up of 60 shekels of c. 8-3 g. each. The purpose of these ingots is uncertain since the preposition 1, 'to, for, belonging to', could either mean that the object was merely part of a consignment of silver sent 'to' Bar-rakib, or that as his royal property it was marked, so to speak, 'in the name of' Bar-rakib, and represented a weight standard for silver. There is perhaps some support for the latter view in a small 139</page><page sequence="10">bronze weight of about the seventh century B.C. from Gezer in Palestine which is inscribed I mlk, presumably 'in the name of the king'.46 The third people, the Phoenicians, are represented by a number of carved ivories of the ninth to eighth centuries B.C. from Nimrud where they, like the shell clappers of Urhilina, had been taken as booty by the Assyrians. These ivories, with a number of others recently acquired,47 were excavated by the British School of Archaeology in Iraq at Fort Shalmaneser, Nimrud. They comprise a fine lion's head (134320; ht. 5-4 cm.; P1. LvII (b)), a lion's paw (134324; length 6-2 cm.), and a half-column palm-capital (134319; ht. I2-6 cm.), all in the round and mortised for attachment, and a number of relief plaques: depicting a scene of two male figures in Egyptian dress on either side of a sacred tree, below a winged disc and a row of uraeus serpents (134316; ht. I2.7 cm.), a stylized sacred tree (134317; ht. 14'9 cm.),48 a winged sphinx (134322; ht. 7 cm.; P1. LVII (c)), the fore quarters (134315; ht. 19.4 cm.; P1. LVII (e)), and hind quarters (134318; ht. I224 cm.),49 of two different winged sphinxes, a grazing deer (134321; ht. 5-3 cm.; P1. Lvii (d)), and a window (134323; ht. 8-4 cm.). Two of these have practice sketches, and alphabetic inscriptions on the back, but the latter do not yield any sense.50 The collection of decorated bronze bowls from Nimrud in the Museums' has been augmented by two new examples: 134711 (diam. 15I-1 cm.; damaged) of about the ninth century B.C. which has a pointed central omphalos in a rosette, and a file of bulls embossed on the inside; and 134903 (diam. I8-2 cm.) of about the seventh century B.C., which is decorated with engraved hunting scenes and animal friezes. The historian Pliny credited the Phoenicians with the invention of glass and, while this claim can no longer be supported, the Phoenicians were certainly great producers of glass. A selection of examples of the sixth to third centuries B.C. has been presented by Miss M. E. A. Wallis in memory of the late E. H. Wallis, Esq. (134326-37). This group includes a number of miniature vessels made on a sand core, with trailed-on decoration: of the sixth to fifth centuries B.C. are an oinochoe (134327; ht. I 2' I cm.; P1. LVIII (e)) and three amphoriskoi (134328-9 (P1. LVIII (c), (a)) and 134330; hts. 2-6, 9-2, and 8 cm.); of the fifth to fourth centuries an oinochoe (034332; ht. 4-8 cm.; P1. LVIII (b)), an amphoriskos (134331; ht. 6-7 cm.), and an alabastron (134326; ht. 15-i cm.; P1. LVIII (d)). The rest of the group consist of part of a polychrome face-bead (134333; ht. 4-3 cm.), two glass cylinders (134334-5; hts. 3'3 and 3-2 cm.), the latter with geometric decorations; and a number of polychrome beads (134336-7). A very large number of such glass pieces were manufactured in the east Mediterranean at this time and it is not always possible to distinguish Phoenician from east Greek work. These types are, however, certainly Phoenician in inspiration.52 In 332 B.C. the Levant was conquered by Alexander the Great, and a period I40</page><page sequence="11">was introduced during which the conventions of Greek art were widely adopted. An interesting example of this is the bronze statuette of c. first century A.D., representing a naked goddess standing on a stepped apsidal podium (134875; ht. 22 cm.; P1. LIX).53 She holds a garland in her right hand and a spherical object in her left, and wears an elaborate Egyptianizing head-dress consisting of a dove with spread wings supporting the disc and cow's horns of the goddess Hathor, with two tall feathers, which together identify her as the Ba'alat Gebal, 'Goddess of Byblos', who was Ashtart.54 In this and subsequent periods Syro-Phoenicia continued to be an important centre for glass making. Probably in the first century B.C. the production of blown vessels was introduced, and some of the new acquisitions illustrate a number of examples of this technique as it was practised in the third to sixth centuries A.D. They comprise a beaker, perhaps part of a hanging lamp (134974; ht. 16 cm.), a long-necked flask with indented sides (135183; ht. 19'3 cm.), a round-bellied flask with knob decoration (135I85; ht. 12.7 cm.), a jar with flaring rim (135186; ht. 12-3 cm.), an oinochoe (135184; ht. io.8 cm.), and a ewer-like vessel with squat body, strap handle, and tubular spout springing from the shoulder at right angles to the handle (135187; ht. 7 cm.) (P1. LX (a)). PALESTINE Palestine, the southern part of the east Mediterranean coast and its hinterland, is most conveniently treated as a separate unit. The new acquisitions include a number of objects of the fourth millennium B.C. from the Wadi Ghazza (Ghuzzeh) near Tell el-Far'ah in southern Palestine.55 These are flint implements (135350-9), a circular stone disc with sharp edge, possibly an unfinished mace-head (135334; diam. 4-3 cm.), clay spindle whorls (1353.37-41), pottery discs with central holes (135333, 135335-6), a fragment of a pot with a pierced lug handle (135332), a cowrie shell (135348), and a fragment of red stone (I35349).56 These objects represent a culture known for convenience as the Ghassul-Beersheba culture, variant forms of which have been found all over Palestine.57 A pottery vessel of the Early Bronze Age, c. 3000 B.C. (134617; ht. I I.7 cm.) has been presented by Miss A. M. Thornton. This is a type well known to archaeologists because it was exported to Egypt where its characteristic wavy ledge handles provided Sir Flinders Petrie with a typological sequence of degenerating forms which helped him to establish a relative chronology for parts of the Egyptian Predynastic period. Three pottery vessels from the excavations of Sir Flinders Petrie at Tell el- Far'ah are of the earlier part of the Late Bronze Age, c. sixteenth to fifteenth century B.C. These are a piriform bottle, a carinated bowl, and a straight-sided juglet (135327-9 respectively; hts. I9-4, 8"3, and I1.2 cm.). 141 T</page><page sequence="12">Two pottery vessels decorated with vertically burnished red slip (135325-6; hts. 23 and 20 cm.), also from Sir Flinders Petrie's Tell el-Far'ah excavations, are probably Egyptian imports of about the tenth century B.C., the time of the foundation of the Israelite monarchy under David and Solomon. During the excavations of Dr. K. Kenyon at Jerusalem a number of interesting features were discovered on the eastern slope of Ophel Hill, the site of the original Canaanite and early Israelite city. Among these were two caves cut into the underlying rock, each containing quantities of intact pottery vessels. One of the caves seems to have been associated with a small room containing two standing stones, and with a built altar. Dr. Kenyon suggests that this was the shrine of an unorthodox cult, the standing stones being biblical mayssgbt, and that the cave was a depository for discarded vessels that had been used in the rituals.58 The second cave does not have such clear associations, though a small paved area nearby may have been somehow connected with it, but it is reasonable to take it, like the other cave, as a depository for used cult vessels.59 MassJb6t, when associated with pagan practices, were forbidden in ancient Israel,60 but this regulation was ignored, as is shown for instance by the condemnation of them in Judah by the eighth-century prophet Micah.6' Among the new acquisi- tions are twenty-three pottery vessels from the second cave (I35213-35), comprising cooking-pots (135213-14, 135224), bowls (135225-30, 135232, 135234-5), a platter (135223), plates (135231, 135233), jugs (135215-19), a juglet (135220), and lamps (135221-2). This pottery is probably of the eighth or early seventh century B.C., the time of the divided monarchy, and about the time of Micah (Pl. Lx (b)). From slightly later, seventh to sixth century B.C., comes a small lump of clay bearing the impression of a seal (134695; P1. Lx (c)). The seal was inscribed, 'Belonging to Hananiah, son of Gedaliah',62 both names being known from the Old Testament, though it is unlikely that they refer to the same men as those there mentioned. The names are clearly identifiable as Hebrew from the ending -iah (-yhw), which is an abbreviated form of Jehovah or Yahweh (yhwh). The impression of papyrus on the back of the clay shows that it was used for sealing a document. A fragment of alabaster (134313; ht. 5'3 cm.) found at Petra, and presented by Captain S. J. S. Boord, dates from the times of the Roman occupation of Palestine. It is incised with a fragment of a monumental inscription in the Nabataean script. Unfortunately this piece is too fragmentary to convey any sense, but it is of interest in illustrating the history of writing, since it was probably from some form of the Nabataean that the modern Arabic script was derived. Also from Petra come a number of sherds of the beautiful painted pottery 142</page><page sequence="13">made by the Nabataeans at the peak of their prosperity during about the first century A.D., when they were middlemen in the trade between Arabia and the Mediterranean world (135212 (15 sherds), presented by Miss P. E. Seccombe; and I35429-33, presented by Mrs. A. Sturdy). While the Nabataeans had this kind of ware for luxury use, they also employed the standard kind of pottery that was in use throughout Palestine. Mrs. A. Sturdy has also presented three sherds of this pottery from the Wadi Rum in Transjordan (135428, 135434-5), and a pottery figurine of an animal of uncertain date from the same area (I 35436). Pottery of this same period is also represented by two flasks (135330-1) from Sir Flinders Petrie's excavations at Tell el-Far'ah. EGYPT In 1887 an important discovery of cuneiform tablets was made at El-Amarna in Egypt. This led to the excavation of the site, which was found to have been ancient Akhetaten, the capital city of the Pharaoh Amenophis IV, better known as Akhenaten (1379-1362 B.C.). The majority of the tablets were diplomatic cor- respondence, but there were a few literary texts among them. In 19 15 a definitive edition was published of the 358 tablets known at that time,63 of which eighty- two had been acquired by the British Museum. Since then a number of others from the original find have come to museums,64 and others were discovered in the course of excavations subsequently carried out at El-Amarna. The Egypt Exploration Society carried out excavations during the years I921-2 and 1926-36, and in 1933 discovered eight tablets,65s which have now been acquired by the British Museum (134863-72).66 Three are letters (134868, 134870, 134872), the second being from Yidya, ruler of Ascalon, already known as the author of a group of letters in the original find,67 two are lists (134863-4), and the others, some of which are very fragmentary, are probably school practice tablets. One of the latter (134866) may be an extract from the epic known as 'The King of Battle' concerning the early Mesopotamian king Sargon of Akkad (2371-2316 B.c.), which purports to describe a campaign conducted by him in Asia Minor. This epic is mainly known from a tablet discovered by a German expedition at El-Amarna in 1913-14.68 What is probably a later version of it, from the Library of Ashurbanipal, has been in the collections of the Museum for over a century,69 and there are probably allusions to it in the text which accom- panies the well-known 'Babylonian Map of the World', also in the Museum.70 Part II of this survey, by R. D. Barnett, dealing with Iran, Asia Minor, and south Arabia, will follow. T. C.
