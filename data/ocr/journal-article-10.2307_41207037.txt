<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Inscription of Cultural Bafflement in E. M. Forster' s A Passage to India Lamia Tayeb University of Tunis As a twentieth century novelist of the colonial experience, E. M. Forster possesses a narrative voice that presents a far-cry from the marginalizing and denigratory representations of Otherness in colonialist fiction. In A Passage to India, he makes intermittent textual hints to the imperial discourse, echoing, playing down or satirizing the traditional fictional rendering of the entire impe- rial experience. His Anglo-Indian saga, however, does not celebrate the dissolu- tion of cultural boundaries; the narrative is rather intent on the inscription of those various forms of de-stabilization inherent upon the attempt to take in the horizon of the other. The perusal of the Otherness of the Orient in the novel un- folds as an edgy enterprise fraught with mystery and uncertainty; hence the fig- ure of bafflement which recurs throughout the narrative. The narrator's vision is, ostensibly, a one-way gaze that identifies its object on solipsistic grounds. Fol- lowing the path of a centrifugal vision, the narrative of a colonial scrutiny of Otherness loses the thread of its own logic; self-confidence gives way to uncer- tainty; decipherability to mystery and impenetrability. Instead of capturing the essence of difference, the narrative articulates the irony, peril and deadlock per- taining to the very trial. Forster enacts the drama of an abortive attempt to span the bridge between the East and the West on the colonial terrain of British India. Space figures in a new light as it is no longer a simple and conventional component of fictional writing that does not outstrip the measure of mere realistic precision and decora- tion. Placing this tendency in the framework of modernist art, Said indicates the fact that "[s]patiality becomes, ironically, the characteristic of an aesthetic rather than of political domination."1 The Indian land figures in various stages of the novel as a personified entity that ensnares characters, acts on them or utters rid- dled messages to them in spite of its apparent silence and immutability. Space, thus, takes unusual dimensions in the novel: it expands and ramifies so far as to unfetter the impediments of narrative texture. It is much more than a stage or a backcloth to action; it is a protagonist and an active operator that mocks every- body behind a screen of fixity and naturalness. 37</page><page sequence="2">Slippery Spaces: The Mocking Land in A Passage to India As a narrator of an Anglo-Indian saga, E. M. Forster foregrounds space as a subject of observation and representation and as a meeting-place between the East and the West. The momentous role of the land in such an encounter is en- hanced by the touch of personification given to the spatial elements that are sparsely commented upon throughout the narrative. The Marabar Hills are "fists and fingers . . . thrust up through the soil."2 The heat "leaps forward" (PI 126) recalling a violent aggressor or a rapacious body. The earth communes with the sky like two breathing bodies. "Strength comes from the sun infused in it [the sky] daily, size from the prostrate earth" (PI 32). Two general tendencies prevail on those passages where space leaps to the narrative eye: a hardening repellence and ugliness gives an ordinary, de-mystified and 'de-exoticized' image of the East. A second, apparently antithetical tendency is towards a mixture of beauty and danger, which endows the land with a metaphysical halo. * * * The emphasis on the plain and the ordinary is sustained throughout the first chapter of the novel despite the panoramic reach of the spatial image. Two snap- shots of the city of Chandrapore produce two utterly different, almost antip- odean images: the setting is cloven into a lowered, chaotic and earthly part, set on the fringes of a raised, neat and paradisiac scene. The debased space - both geographically and materially - is the one occupied by the Indians. An ironical undertone pervades the lengthy description of squalor and shabbiness. The city is so ingrained in the soil as to appear some natural protuberance indistinguish- able from it. Even the sacred river Ganges loses its spell in that part. Edged rather than washed by the river Ganges, it trails for a couple of miles along the bank, scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish it deposits so freely. There are no bathing-steps on the river front, as the Ganges happens not to be holy here; indeed there is no river front, and bazaars shut out the wide and shifting panorama of the stream. The streets are mean, the temples ineffective, and though a few fine houses exist they are hidden away in gardens or down alleys whose filth deters all but the in- vited guest. ... In the bazaars, there is no painting and scarcely any carv- ing. The very wood seems made of mud, the inhabitants of mud moving. So abased, so monotonous is everything that meets the eye, that when the Ganges comes down, it might be expected to wash the excrescence back into the soil. (P/ 31) The lack of color is contrasted to the profusion of light and vegetation in the Anglo-Indian part, but the neat civil station appears in the midst of the lush foli- 38</page><page sequence="3">age as an ordinary space that "provokes no emotion. It charms not, neither does it repel" (PI 32). Despite the sublimation of the orbit of the English colonizers in Chandrapore, the effect is counteracted by a comment that fits it back in the general drabness of the panorama. The last component of the scene, the distant Marabar Hills, is the only component that holds an extraordinary element, the Caves. The indication of the Caves in the map of Chandrapore throws some light on the momentous, though peripheral, stage that will host the encounter between the East and the West. In this vein, Forster satirizes the colonizer's onset of geo- graphical mapping and cultural translation. The imperial vision of space is per- turbed by a spatial prospect of chaos and amorphousness. "No mountains in- fringe on the curve. League after league the earth lies flat, heaves a little, is flat again" (PI 32). Like a prostrate, lethargic body, the Indian earth emits nothing but the quiet breath of a secret profound life. Sara Suleri discerns this tendency towards 'de-exiticization' in the novel: "Forster turns to visualizing landscape as though to an act of cultural description that is relentlessly anti-exotic in its in- tent."3 In his narrative attempt to mediate an accurate image of the Marabar Caves, Forster seems to search for the 'extraordinary identity' beyond the ordi- nary, banalizing description of scientific report. Having provided such an image of measurable matter, he cannot help falling back into an experience of the dull and the unexciting. Having seen one such cave, having seen two, having seen three, four, fourteen, twenty-four, the visitor returns to Chandrapore uncertain whether he has had an interesting experience or a dull one or any experi- ence at all. . . . Nothing, nothing attaches to them, and their reputation - for they have one - does not depend upon human speech. It is as if the surrounding plain or the passing birds have taken upon themselves to ex- claim 'extraordinary!' and the word has taken root in the air, and been in- haled by mankind. (PI 138) One needs to have recourse to the mystical in order to get any sense of the holy. Language can denote nothing but that vacuum inherent in the very shape of the cave. Cultural description is delimited by this reiterative architecture and the horrific echo in the interior. These enhance the unattainability of the enticing secrecy of a Marabar magnificence and distort it in an inevitable depthlessness and meaninglessness. M.M. Mahood argues that the Caves' darkness symbolizes the state of matter when emptied of spirit: Untouched by heavenly virtue, the landscape of the Marabar Caves is the 'unloving earth, without a throb to answer ours' of Whitman's poem from which Forster took his title. . . . Her [Mrs. Moore's] experience in the caves is of a metaphysical darkness and emptiness, the meaninglessness of matter devoid of spirit.4 39</page><page sequence="4">A second element of harshness characterizes some features of the Indian land. A certain degree of animosity and aggressivity is attributed to many ele- ments of the natural scene. Newcomers have to be cautioned against all kinds of dangers. "There are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the Marabar Hills, snakes also" (PI 43). Ronny and Adela run into a wild animal during a night spin. The accident comes most wantonly and unexpectedly. "They gripped . . . bump, jump, a swerve, two wheels lifted in the air, brakes on, bump with a tree at edge of embankment, standstill. An accident. A slight one. Nobody hurt" (PI 103). Their Indian host, Nawab Bahadur, dumbfounded and childlike, does not add any insight into the circumstances of the accident. He leaves Ronny and Adela to guess at the identity of the animal that has run into them. Like the green bird that they fail to identify (PI 101), they can only con- jecture that it is a hyena. "Hyenas prowl in nullas and headlights dazzle them" (PI 105). That's the nearest to logic Ronny 's explanation can go. Things and incidents always appear screened by a haze of incomprehensibility, and no piece of knowledge can reach the stature of certainty. It was just after the exit from a bridge; the animal had probably come up out of the nullah. Steady and smooth ran the marks of the car, ribbons neatly nicked with lozenges; then all went mad. Certainly some external force had impinged, but the road had been used by too many objects for any one track to be legible, and the torch created such high lights and black shadows that they could not interpret what it revealed. (PI 104) Even the dumb earth does not lie quietly under the tread of life on it. "There is something hostile in that soil. It either yields, and the foot sinks into a depres- sion, or else it is unexpectedly rigid and sharp, pressing stones or crystals against the tread" (PI 40). The earth seems to react to the flow of movement on it so that humans feel engaged in a perpetual battle with the world about. The aggressiveness of the Indian land does not lie only in its evasive fauna and "hos- tile soil." It is present in another element: the climate or the Indian hot season, which diffuses throughout the narrative like the forebodings of an oppressive calamity. Forster dwells on the deterrent nature of the Indian hot weather for both the English and the natives. The heat gradually submerges the land like a falling incubus, crashing people's spirits and galling their bodies. The sense of physical discomfort, even torture, mediates a parallel depression that strips the individual of his/her humanity. Coming out of the bungalow, the visitors of doctor Aziz "were aware of a common burden, a vague threat which they called 'the bad weather coming'" (PI 126). A dense, stifling atmosphere swathes their bodies, as the space between them and their carriages, instead of being empty, was clogged with a medium that pressed against their flesh, the carriage cush- _</page><page sequence="5">ions scalded their trousers, their eyes pricked, domes of hot water accu- mulated under their headgear and poured down their cheeks. (PI 126) The sense of devastation is mediated by the image of the rapacious, pouncing heat. 'The heat had leapt forward in the last hour, the street was deserted as if a catastrophe had cleaned off humanity" {PI 126). The interior offers a refuge, both for bodies - against a sun-scorched land - and spirits "to recover their self- esteem and the qualities that distinguished them from each other11 {PI 127). In the description of the coming heat, emphasis on loathsomeness and a sense of onerous disappointment reverberate the ugly commonness of Chandrapore at the opening of the novel. Unlike a benign and glamorous English sun, the Indian sun conquers the land ingloriously: "The sun was returning to his kingdom with power but without beauty - that was the sinister feature. If only there had been beauty! His cruelty would have been tolerable then11 {PI 127). Through his depiction of the Indian setting, Forster stresses the alienating features of the land. From the point of view of the colonizer, these are the ele- ments that make alterity so remote, alien and intransigent. They are what makes the exploring newcomer sail back in horror, forever dropping the possibility of adaptation and integration. The emphasis on the sinister and the ominously im- pending in the atmosphere denotes the inherent incompatibility of the Indian environment for social and cultural exchange. The ordinary and the horribly repulsive features conjoin and blend to produce a marred image of the East that is - like the echo in the Marabar Caves - "so debarred from glory11 {PI 127), and so empty of promise for an eternally estranged colonizer. * * ♦ We can discern in the novel a tendency towards a dual vision. Things can at once be mysteriously beautiful and bathetically dull and vacuous, then they are cursorily summed up in figure of incomprehensibility. This pattern, which recurs throughout the narrative, is seen to be a distinctive part of modernist aesthetics. Edward Said argues that "the hallmark of modernist form is the strange juxtapo- sition of comic and tragic, high and low, commonplace and exotic, familiar and alien."5 But this tendency takes a disturbing cast in Forster's novel. "How can the mind take hold of such a country?" {PI 148). The question articulates the invader's dilemma in front of a vast luring land, and conveys a sense of deep anxiety concerning the reconnoitre of an abstruse space. The insatiable imagina- tion of the colonizers fails to engulf this mysterious variety and far-reaching expanse. They fail to pigeonhole and fit a spatial foreignness into their system of knowledge. Everything seems to evade subjection to their identificatory linguis- tic reference. Ronny and Adela fail to name a green bird that hovers above them. It simply disappears before they can make it out. 41</page><page sequence="6">A little green bird was observing her, so brilliant and neat that it might have hopped straight out of a shop. On catching her eye it closed its own, gave a small skip and prepared to go to bed. Some Indian wild bird. . . . The bird in question dived into the dome of the tree. It was of no impor- tance, yet they would have liked to identify it, it would somehow have solaced their hearts. But nothing in India is identifiable, the mere asking of a question causes it to disappear or to merge in something else. (PI 100-01) Reluctant to admit their ignorance and paralyzed by the intransigence and eva- siveness of such surroundings, the colonizers tend to reduce alterity to a "threadbare and dangerous literalism," as Sara Suleri suggests in her book, The Rhetoric of English India6 She argues that this literalization of the Indian geog- raphy is the only way by which the West can overcome spatial inscrutability and abate the fear of its ignorance. A bathetic scene of Indian sunrise is indicative of this tendency to misinterpret the apparent crudeness of things. The orange hue of the rising sun near the Marabar Hills announces a splendid and romantic specta- cle. But all sense of glory and magnificence gradually vanishes. "They awaited the miracle. But at the supreme moment, When night should have died and day lived, nothing occurred. It was as if virtue had failed in the celestial fount . . . The sun rose without splendour" (PI 149-50). The sun takes its place in the Eastern horizon like a shameful, sneaking body. The hues in the East decayed, the hills seemed dimmer though in fact bet- ter lit, and a profound disappointment entered with the morning breeze. Why, when the chamber was prepared, did the bridegroom not enter with trumpets and shawms, as humanity expects? The sun rose without splen- dour. He was presently observed trailing yellowish behind the trees, or against insipid sky. (PI 150) The sense of cheating and falsification is corroborated by the ensuing remark by Adela Quested, "That must be a false dawn," and appeased by a compensatory evocation of a Grasmere sunrise with the familiar English scene in the back- ground. The sense of alienation is again abated by recourse to the familiar West- ern framework of things. Every shortcoming is transplanted on the other side, and every hollowness is derided from the point of view of a Western grandios- ity. Life in India "had no consequences, that is to say, sounds did not echo or thoughts develop. Everything seemed cut off at its root, and therefore infected with illusion" (PI 152). Forster's comment is an instance of the colonial intran- sigence that characterizes the Western interplay with the alien. Since alterity is either too banal to attend to or too enigmatic and evasive to fathom, the coloniz- ers can only "remain in exile. The important towns they build are only retreats, their quarrels the malaise of men who cannot find their way home" (PI 148-49). Brooding over her ftiture life with Ronny in India, Adela Quested feels dejected _</page><page sequence="7">about the prospect of leading such a dull and arid life amid the variety of the Indian setting. She realizes that she will forever contemplate India from a dis- tance - behind the confines of her English circle of life - and let it "slide by un- noticed" (PI 66). The curious newcomer soon realizes the danger of leading such a secluded life. She will inevitably homogenize and fix the diversity of a wonderful Indian scene into a rigid and inflexible block since "the force that lies behind colour and movement would escape her even more effectually than it did now. She would see India always as a frieze, never as a spirit [Emphasis added]" (PI 66). But the temptation to forge ahead and penetrate this layered strangeness is ineluctable for both the pedantic Adela and benevolent Mrs. Moore. Behind a veneer of magnificent richness, India "calls 'come' through her hundred mouths, through objects ridiculous and august. But come to what? She has never defined. She is noi a promise, only an appeal [Emphasis added]" (PI 149). The last statement offers an insight into the dubiousness that characterizes the spatial component in the novel. The enticing nature is what later increases the disillu- sionment of the explorer. A magnetic power seems to draw him/her to the site of mystery only to jolt him/her back in a state of limbo and blankness. Although Mrs. Moore seems to fulfil the role of the touristic passer-by, she is the only character that perceives the dubious feature of the Indian space. Gazing down on the river Ganges on a radiant night, she feels its impalpable luminescence. "Be- low them a radiance had suddenly appeared. It belonged neither to water nor moonlight, but stood like a luminous sheaf upon the fields of darkness" (PI 52- 53). In this moment of revelation, she voices the extraordinary blending of cap- tivating beauty and repellent crudeness. "She continued 'what a terrible river! What a wonderful river!' and sighed" (PI 53). Her portentous words are preg- nant with a sense of a heartrending mysteriousness and an impending threat. Various readings of the novel go into the interpretation of the echo in the Marabar Caves. In "The birth of Krishna," M. M. Mahood argues that "response to the echo ... is the test of the characters' ability to go down to the root and meet India."7 It also symbolizes "the attribution of evil to everything that we exclude from our own rigorous concept of the good."8 The description of Mrs. Moore's experience inside the Cave exemplifies this materialisation of evil spir- its. In the pitch darkness of the cave, she feels the frictions of the crowd and hears the horrific echo, which later traumatizes her. Satanic images abound in front of her eyes: a "coiling worm" and "a snake composed of small snakes . . . writhe independently" (PI 159). Later, they turn out to be mere diseased visions provoked by a small flame. Once she is out of the cave, she perceives the com- mon reality and materiality of things and people. As each person emerged she looked for a villain, but none was there, and she realized that she had been among the mildest individuals, whose only 43</page><page sequence="8">desire was to honour her, and that the naked pad was a poor little baby, astride its mother's hip. Nothing evil had been in the cave, but she had not enjoyed herself; no, she had not enjoyed herself, and she decided not to visit a second one. (PI 159) Both the echo and the frictions inside the cave provoke a hair-raising fear and a maddening loss; a loss of sensation that leads to a momentary loss of identity. Abdul R. JanMohamed argues that "the caves represent the fundamental, uncon- scious identity from which all natural and social differences emanate and to which they all return when they can escape their phenomenal manifestation."9 The darkness helps a transcendental reaching of the fundamental truth: the con- sciousness, stripped of its somatic location and freed of its conventionalized, sensually mediated perceptions, can soar to the primary quintessence of exis- tence. After this mystical union, Mrs. Moore comes out of the cave dumfounded and nearly fainting. The traumatic stupor she goes through shows how shattering such a revelation is. "The more she thought over it, the more disagreeable and frightening it became ... the echo begun in some indescribable way to under- mine her hold on life" (PI 160). The vile echo 'ou-boum' sucks everything in its undermining vacancy and reduces all existence - an artificial construction wrought by a deluded human mind - to a hollow nonsense. "'Everything exists, nothing has value.' If one had spoken vileness in that place, or quoted lofty po- etry, the comment would be the same - 'ou-boum'" (PI 160). India utters her scornful, though riddled cry to the invader and the world: you are as frail and destructible as a colony of ants: your glories, arts and sciences are as void as your humdrum existence. Brittle Bridges: Cross-Cultural Encounters in A Passage to India A Passage to India studies the viability of transcending the encumbrances of the colonial situation, on the part of both the colonialist and the native, in order to set up new formulas of social interaction and cross-cultural exchange. The bulk of the English settlers in India is portrayed as an immutably exclusive community. The relinquishment of their privileged status, for an egalitarian ex- change with the Indian, is inconceivable for them. However open, civil, and even obsequious the native might behave, he cannot hope to penetrate the hard shell of their disdainful, effacing superciliousness. The endeavor to approach and communicate with the colonized is represented from the outset as an aberra- tion. Adela Quested's curiousness to see and know Indians elicits a host of ex- clamations from her English friends. "One said 'Wanting to see Indians! How new that sounds!'" (PI 48). This newness, however, bears a negative and unde- sirable cast. It is a nuisance in the sense that it is a reminder of the usurpations of colonization and the colonizer's imperiousness and denigration of the native. 44</page><page sequence="9">Without any qualms, however, Ronny anxiously reflects about his future wife's fretfulness about contacting Indians: "It would be tiresome if she started crooked over the native question" (PI 52). Against this backdrop, Forster verifies the possibilities of colonial encounter and problematizes the various forms of rap- prochement. He singles out three performers for this mission. They hover about the charismatic figure of Dr. Aziz, each driven by different motives varying from the spiritual affinities of Mrs. Moore to the social motivations of Adela Quested and the personal predilection of Fielding. The Spiritual Bonding As a quiet and taciturn character, Mrs. Moore engages in an interplay with alterity that takes a subtle, telepathic aspect. Her spiritual evolution throughout the narrative reaches its paroxysm in her idolization in the courtroom, and her sacrificial death. She first interrupts the quiet solitude of Dr. Aziz, looming in the entrance of the mosque like the shadow of a spirit. Her shadowy appearance remains indistinct in the dimness of moonlight. For a little while she is only a vague figure with a benevolent voice for Dr. Aziz and, in his mind, he draws a beautiful image - "a fabric bigger than the Mosque" (PI 42-43) - of her. Though provoking a little disappointment at first, the gradual disclosure of the character of Mrs. Moore unveils her venerable wisdom and receptive magnanimity. The first give-and-take between her and Dr. Aziz, in the sublime quietude of the mosque, cements a special bond between them; one that is firmly based on a parallelism of experience - widowhood and parenthood - and of spiritual depth. "That makes no difference. God is here" (PI 42), says Mrs. Moore expressing her reverence for the mosque as an emblem of divine presence and an anodyne space for spiritual healing. This inchoate relationship does not develop through- out the narrative and seals a firm bond between the two characters. Their affinity outstrips the slow, awkward pace of social advances and disregards the ideologi- cal and racial barriers of colonialism. An easy familiarity and a candid intimacy then gathers Mrs. Moore and Dr. Aziz. "The flame that not even beauty can nourish was springing up, and though his words were querulous his heart began to glow secretly. Presently it burst into speech" (PI 45). Their minds seem to have free recourse and achieve a transcendental unity. The implicit agreement between them about the muddle of India indicates a certain emotional corre- spondence that can dispense with the strain of argument. Mrs. Moore's preco- cious understanding of India stems from this recourse: "A mystery is a high- sounding term for a muddle. No advantage in stirring it up, in either case. Aziz and I know well that India is a muddle" (PI 86). This shared revelation accrues from a telepathic correspondence between them. The excess of openness is, . 45</page><page sequence="10">however, what leads to the fatal invitation and the concomitant "stirring up" of the mystery. The metaphysical concerns of Mrs. Moore enable her to comprehend the es- sence of the Indian reality. Pitted against the pedantic search of Adela Quested, her silent, imperceptible cognition of the latent mystery of the Indian land ele- vates her to a prophetic status. So much as it is revelatory, this prophetic experi- ence is also insidiously sapping and profoundly shaking. The first serious en- counter with the muddle of India occurs inside a Marabar cave, and its after- effect vacillates between a sense of dullness and a state of trauma. The echo haunts her ear turning the dullness into a hideous affliction. The singularity of Mrs. Moore's experience - "Professor Godbole never mentioned an echo; it never impressed him, perhaps," while "Aziz and Adela both emerged smiling" {PI 158-59) - corroborates her prophetic stand and metaphysical insight into the Indian phenomena. But Forster relentlessly points to the danger and impairing effect of this experience, which later manifests itself more conspicuously in Adela's tragedy. He seals each encounter with a diffident regression and a tim- orous flight. Cross-Cultural Friendship Friendship, the interplay of personal and social inclinations, is shirked or ut- terly discarded from the viable possibilities of the colonial human exchanges. Relations of paternalism, officialism and authority strictly define the various interactions between the colonialist and the native, and confine them to a single vertical pattern. Mrs. Turton dissuades the two newcomers from approaching the Indian women at the Bridge Party, saying: "You are superior to everyone in In- dia" {PI 61). This presumptive superiority is what invalidates the establishment of a hybrid friendship and forbids the settler to overstep the boundaries of the colonial self-sequestered herd. Those who dare contravene these colonial norms must, on the one hand, undergo the volatility and unpredictability of such a cross-cultural approach, and accommodate the quailing responses of the colo- nized. On the other hand, they bear the brunt of their countrymen's grudge and acrimony, as well as the slur of disloyalty. * * * Forster offers a poignant study of the undulatory permutations of cross- cultural friendship: its psychological setbacks and subtle nuances. The discrep- ancy between Fielding's resolution to cross the threshold of the Indian interior, and the colonialist's denial, for the native, of any privacy worth looking into, is what makes the attempt highly shaky. The vicissitudes of the colonial complex "46</page><page sequence="11">of racism, prejudice, and natural caution exacerbate the inaccessibility of the social and personal space of friendship. While Fielding is "happiest in the give- and-take of a private conversation" (PI 80), Mr. Heaslop, the City Magistrate, believes that "nothing is private in India" (PI 54), and that every exchange boils down to an essence of colonial hostility. The main undertaking of the extro- verted colonial is the crossing of political and cultural boundaries to reach the bland privacy of a native's dwelling, as well as the wholehearted receptivity of his/her character. "The world," for Fielding, "is a globe of men who are trying to reach one another and can best do so by the help of goodwill plus culture and intelligence" (PI 80). What follows is a study of the efficiency of these strate- gies - goodwill, culture and intelligence - in the Anglo-Indian context. Friendship between Dr. Aziz and Fielding follows an ebb and flow motion throughout the novel. Every excess of emotion is followed by a secret recession or an awkward reserve and a frustrating letdown. After the spontaneously har- monious exchange between Dr. Aziz and Fielding, an inadvertent remark on Post-Impressionism evokes the fundamental hurdles of racism and provokes a thwarting setback. "The remark suggested that he, an obscure Indian, had no right to have heard of Post-Impressionism - a privilege preserved for the Ruling Race" (PI 84). Politics interferes to spoil any reach after cordiality, while recip- rocal 'goodwill' is the only intercourse through which the tide of intimacy can flow unrestrained, and offset the ebbs of cultural and political bigotry. The second regression in Fielding's newly established friendship with Aziz occurs when he intrudes on the privacy of Aziz's sick bed. Here, where hospital- ity fails and goodwill strives in vain against the cold civility and internal tension of a multicultural gathering, the previous intimacy vanishes, and gives way to an insidious repudiation. A mixture of outrage and despondency is the inevitable drawback of such a strained conversation. Fielding feels "rather disappointed with his call" (PI 126). He cannot hope to allay the resentment and caution that his position as a colonial in India inspired. After all, he is the privileged, supe- rior English citizen, whose move towards the native is considered as a conde- scension. Even if he disavows prejudice and condemns colonization, he fails to ally himself completely with the oppressed, because "what he is actually re- nouncing is part of himself, and what he slowly becomes as soon as he accepts a life in a colony."10 Fielding's confession that he is privileged over the educated natives - "I got in first" (PI 124) - fails to lessen the aversion of Aziz's visitors and hopelessly leads the conversation to a deeper entanglement. The poisonous intrusion of politics - "There they were! Politics again." (PI 124) - is what pre- cludes the sealing of a permanent friendship between Aziz and Fielding. This intrusion is inevitable, however, in the presence of a multicultural meeting. Pri- vacy and intimacy are reinstated when the two champions of cross-cultural friendship recover their confidential togetherness, and it is no wonder that the 47</page><page sequence="12">photograph of Aziz's dead wife serves as a pretext to regain the safe ground of intimacy. The recourse to such a treasured, though common enough, item sym- bolizes hailing friendship despite all the faltering on the way, "they were friends, brothers. That part was settled, their compact had been subscribed by the photo- graph, they trusted one another, affection had triumphed for once in a way" (PI 133). The new friendship is settled, however, on the eve of Aziz's tragedy, and so, put to a new test. * * * These advances cannot be made without loss and sacrifices: the colonial in- gratiates himself with the natives, and wins their sympathy and unflinching de- votion to the detriment of his intercourse with his countrymen. Mr. Fielding "had found it more convenient and pleasant to associate with Indians and he must pay the price" (PI 81); the price of rejection and calumniation. His coun- trymen will not tolerate his apostasy, especially when patriotism is at its acme, and the "herd instinct" (PI 80) is fully displayed. In the context of the nationalist and patriotic dimensions that the arrest of Dr. Aziz has taken, Fielding's alliance with his Indian friend is treasonable. Albert Memmi states that "wonder has been expressed at the vehemence of colonizers against any among them who put colonisation in jeopardy."11 With his gradual conversion to the cause of the na- tive, Fielding loses the quiet and stability of his belonging to his countrymen. Not only is he ostracized from this familiar and brotherly group, but he is con- demned to a middle position as he realizes that he cannot integrate himself into either flank. Fielding's unwontedness to the Indian cast and character is what slackens his moral fervor and blackens his vision of this colonial scandal. "At the moment when he was throwing in his lot with Indians he realized the pro- fundity of the gulf that divided him from them. They always do something dis- appointing" (PI 181). Albert Memmi analyzes the cultural and psychological impediments that make the colonial waver in his full cooperation and associa- tion with the natives: "He has another civilisation before him, customs differing from his own, men whose reactions often surprise him, with whom he does not feel deep affinity."12 Fielding continues his backing of Aziz out of human com- passion and understanding; he can see that the colonizer's shortcomings are not part of his character, but logical outcomes of the tyranny of the British Raj. "Fear is everywhere; the British Raj rests on it; the respect and courtesy Fielding himself enjoyed were unconscious acts of propitiation" (PI 182). Fielding displays a deep understanding of Aziz's plight and Adela's di- lemma. Being able to objectify and atone the national and political bias of his judgments, and to rid himself of the bigoted vision of colonialism, he first takes up cudgels for the innocence of Dr. Aziz and allies himself with the cohort of 48</page><page sequence="13">the Indians. Later, he is the only character who commiserates with Adela Quested and stands by her in the aftermath of the trial. He is the omniscient ob- server and the detached onlooker who fathoms the warped rationale of national and cultural enmity, and the hoodwinked vision of colonial racial hatred. As a man of high principle and human understanding, Fielding stands out as the staunchest adherent of cross-cultural friendship and the wisest observer of the blind bigotry and mutual lash of racial prejudice and hatred. His course is inevi- tably the toughest path on the colonial terrain; an adamantine passage on which he has to fight against the cliquishness of his fellow-countrymen, and the cryptic reserve of the colonized. The adequacy of space and time for the establishment of cross-cultural friendship remains the biggest issue in such an endeavor. Cross-Cultural Invitation The starting click and the working engine of friendship is the procedure of invitation. The three components of invitation, the inviter, the invited, and the its physical and civil space, are sketched on the colonial space of British India. At times, they appear as mere puppets in the hands of the narrator, who alternately reverses positions and experiments with different combinations on varied grounds and circumstances, in order to accomplish a thorough sketching of the imbroglio of cross-cultural invitation. It becomes the central trope and the recur- rent theme of the novel. Sara Suleri suggests that "A Passage to India translates the question of cross-cultural friendship into a more vertiginous study of how cultures both issue and misread invitations to one another."13 The plot can be boiled down to a succession of invitations, advances and regressions. The core image is one of puzzlement, misunderstanding and disappointment. * * * The first event embodying cross-cultural invitation is the symbolic concoc- tion of the Bridge Party. The episode of the party involves the abstraction of the two groups into East and West, and mocks the image of the Bridge by some textual hints at its physical, and therefore, metaphorical absence. The eye of the narrator strives to catch an overview of the encounter in the framework of a global panorama. A pattern of parallel layers is drawn: "Some kites hovered overhead, impartial, over the kites passed the mass of a vulture, and with an im- partiality exceeding all, the sky, not deeply coloured but translucent, poured light from its whole circumference" (PI 59-60). As it soars higher and higher, this omniscient eye transcends the split outline of the cross-cultural gathering to the unifying, all-encompassing mass of the sky. As the site of purity and impar- tiality, the sky mocks the artificial fissures of the earth. Viewed from such a 49</page><page sequence="14">pristine and immaculate expanse, the earth appears as a stained space inadequate for invitation and conversation. Silence prevails over the gathering and conver- sation strives in vain against the barriers of uncertainty. "Indeed, all the ladies were uncertain, cowering, recovering, giggling, making tiny gestures of atone- ment or despair at all that was said" (PI 62). What flaws this invitation is its lack of a conceivable formula of demeanor and social interaction for both groups. The party lacks a pre-established and conventionalized social etiquette that dic- tates a definite code of behavior and serves to gauge the extent of its success or failure. "There was a curious uncertainty about their gestures, as if they sought for a new formula which neither East nor West could provide" (PI 62). The absence of social and cultural convention saps the foundations of the Bridge. Trying to maintain a short chat with the Bhattacharyas, Adela Quested "strove in vain against the echoing walls of their civility" (PI 62). Mrs. Moore invites herself to their home, when trying to kindle the dying smothers of the glow-less conversation. Ironically, the proposition that is meant to unravel the tangle the conversation has woven into, and to maintain a social bond between them and this Indian family, is the very one that is going to bar any further inter- action. The excess of hospitality and receptivity - the Bhattacharya are willing to receive Mrs. Moore without fussing about the timing - turns deceptively into an equivocal letdown, when the whole plan is annulled without any plausible explanation. While Dr. Aziz explains the incident away by his witty remark: "We are by nature a most informal people" (PI 85), and while Fielding dis- misses it "seeing at once that it was the kind of incident that had better not be cleared up" (PI 85), it remains submerged in a cloud of mystery, ludicrousness, and implausibility. This abortive attempt at an Anglo-Indian social affiliation predicates the ab- surdity of the Bridge Party and the awkwardness of the whole endeavor of a colonial rapprochement, since the underpinnings of the bridge are dilapidated. "Why they come at all I don't know. They hate it as much as we do" (PI 61), says Mrs. Turton. The brittle basement is one of mutual hatred and precarious- ness. Being on such an insecure ground, both parties have little hope to establish a long-standing exchange. ♦ * * In the Marabar Caves expedition, another experimentation with cross- cultural invitation is carried out. Like that of the Bhattacharyas, Aziz's invitation of Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested comes on the spur of the moment. Ironically, his heartfelt and almost compensatory bidding wanes after the realisation of its inadequacy and impractical ity in the private space of his bungalow. Having been declared, the invitation has to be shunned or shunted at all costs. Invitation in- __</page><page sequence="15">volves a sense of pride and a desire to show off the richness of one's home as well as the magnanimity and lavishness of one's character. As Aziz bitterly re- members the ugliness and poverty of his dwelling, one of the chief foundations of this social entertainment falls apart, leaving the two participants groundless and crippled. The internal grief and vexation of Dr. Aziz plays downs the gener- osity of his endeavor, and drives him to plunge the whole company in the realm of the distant and extraneous Marabar Caves, where he can decently carry out this social rite. "lYes, all that is settled,' he cried. 'I invite you all to see me in the Marabar Caves'" (PI 91). The sense of peril pervades the whole episode, since Aziz evades the shame of an uninviting home and an odious privacy to stumble, instead, on the rugged ground of the Marabar Hills, where every claim to hospitality is bedimmed in the obscurity of the caves. The contrast between Aziz's soothing declaration, "there will be no muddle when you come to see me" (PI 86), and the tense ups and downs that the expedition later undergoes points to the continual disappointment that colonial invitation generates. The baulked muddle of India manifests itself horrendously inside the cave. Cross-cultural invitation is represented as the most perilous of colonial en- counters. Aziz's expedition comes out most arduous and unmanageable because he has chosen the unyielding space of the Marabar Hills. "Trouble after trouble encountered him, because he has challenged the spirit of the Indian earth, which tries to keep men in compartments" (PI 141). Indeed, his provision turns out to be a test of organization and perfectionism for him and his people. The inviter sinks in the mire of responsibility and vigilance over the comfort and safety of his dignified English guests. The invited is equally afflicted by a sense of inse- curity, being in the hands of an unreliable native. Both consent to the expedition as one goes through a tiresome rite. "No one was enthusiastic, yet it took place" (PI 140). Aziz strives against the stigma of a colonial stereotype of laxity and untrustworthiness. The expedition is his precarious chance to prove to the colo- nizer the fruitfulness of his gumption and the sincerity of his transnational out- reaching. His love for his guests is insuperable, because "he had surmounted obstacles to meet them, and this stimulates a generous mind" (PI 154). This moment of anodyne complacency is what further embitters the sham of success, and increases the bane of Aziz's disaster. The underhand vermiculation of the quixotic fabric of the expedition, behind the façade of accomplishment, en- hances the illusoriness of cross-cultural outreaching. * * * The spatial component on which Forster carries out his experimentation of cross-cultural invitation is the one that endorses its failure. The puzzle of the Marabar caves is exposed in the episode of the expedition. Within an unclear 51</page><page sequence="16">chain of causation, it is also the one that provokes Aziz's inculpation. Space first frees Adela from the constraints of social pressures, and plunges her into a lengthy reflection on marriage; however, civility and hospitality collapse at the very moment when Adela touches upon the delicate question of polygamy. The spontaneous, matter-of-fact question for the one, is a conversational impasse and a cultural stroke for the other. As he managed to utter an awkward answer, Aziz "let go of her hand" (PI 164), a physical and metaphorical ending of cross- cultural espousal. The contrast between Adela and Aziz is striking: while the latter "plunged into one of them [the caves] to recover his balance" (PI 164), Adela entered the cave casually thinking about marriage. Ironically, the space that provides for the one a kind of shelter against cultural embarrassment, is the very one that destabilizes the cultural smugness of the other, and dives her into the unconscious orbit of her racial body. For Adela Quested, balanced delicately between the spiritual concerns of Mrs. Moore and the purely social ones of Fielding (who finds the caves meaningless and unimpressive), the unconscious realm of the caves mir- rors her own repressed sexuality, the horror of which is quickly projected, with the eager help of the Anglo-Indian community . . . onto the racial Other, Aziz, who was the object of her fantasy.14 In the cave, the fanciful lurking of Aziz's body and his whimsical assault on Adela denote her unconscious, repressed desires. Both the civil and physical spaces of invitation disclose their slipperiness and unpredictability. Hospitality awkwardly trips on the geographical and cultural stumbling-blocks of inscruta- bility - "come to what? She has never defined." - and subsides in the effacing depths of the cave. India's appeal has nothing in store for the buoyant visitor but a horrid hollowness and a disconcerting meaninglessness. Failure of Cultural Espousal E. M. Forster's preoccupation with syncretic solutions for an East-West diehard intransigence, and his quest after a panacea for a worldwide blight of colonization and its racial and cultural ramifications, is what makes his novel, A Passage to India, an uncertain narrative as to the conclusion of colonial ex- change. What precludes the sealing of a safe intimacy lies at the heart of a va- cant geography and a mysterious cultural articulation. Historical reality further de-stabilizes the conviction of cross-cultural friendship, and dictates its untime- liness. Aziz's calamity ends in his transformation at the end of the novel. His espousal of a nationalist penchant opens the narrative of a colonial present onto the realms of decolonization. 52</page><page sequence="17">The Puzzle of the Caves A Passage to India demonstrates the inconvenience and ungainliness of cross-cultural exchange by an expression of the continual disappointment and bafflement such an exchange generates. Both geography and cultural expres- sion - especially in the Hindu religion - issue their eager exhortation to the world and later fall short of their promises. The recurrent admonition, "come, come," in Godbole's song and in India's anthropomorphic invocation, is an ironic forerunner of the coming frustration and disillusionment. No anticlimactic depthlessness lies beneath the superficial sheen, but the terrible hollowness of a vacant, darkness-clogged interior. "What had spoken to her in that scoured-out cavity of the granite? What dwelt in the first of the caves? Something very old and very small. Before time, it was before space also. Something snub-nosed, incapable of generosity - the undying worm itself (PI 212). Mrs. Moore tries to extend her imagination beyond the conceivable data of the live world, but her visions evaporate in the tenebrous nothingness of the cave. "The abyss also may be petty, the serpent of eternity made of maggots" (PI 213). Undecidability is, thus, solved by the figure of senselessness mediated by the cave's single utter- ance of the signifier 'ou-boum'. In this vein, Homi Bhabha argues that Cultural difference, as Adela experienced it, in the nonsense of the Mara- bar Caves, is not the acquisition or accumulation of additional cultural knowledge; it is the momentous, if momentary, extinction of the recog- nizable object of culture in the disturbed artifice of its signification, at the edge of experience.15 Adela's mystified experience inside the cave denotes the unhinging loss of meaning, which is readily suppressed by the more cogent explanation of rape. This entanglement elides the appropriacy of cross-cultural conversation. "What happened in the Marabar Caves? There, the loss of the narrative of cultural plu- rality; there, the implausibility of conversation and commensurability; there, the enactment of an undecidable, uncanny colonial present."16 Mrs. Moore discerns the undermining nonsense of the Marabar signifier and has a mystical access to the one fundamental truth lying beneath the variety of lived experience, "'bourn' is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or 4bou-oum' or lou- bounV - utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce 'bourn'" (PI 159). In the derisive farewell of India to Mrs. Moore, when she sails back to England, the palm-trees voice this mocking va- cancy: "So you thought an echo was India; you took the Marabar Caves as fi- nal?" (PI 214). India baffles the confident, touristic excavation. It is not the duc- tile space that easily yields its beautiful and repellent features, as well as the secrecies of its difference or uniqueness, to the e lassi ficatory study of the West- 53</page><page sequence="18">ern explorer. India is the site of gorgeous variety, on which the indecipherability of cultural difference and the implausibility of colonial exchange are enacted. Failure of Cross-Cultural Friendship The different instances of cross-cultural friendship in A Passage to India end in a calamitous breach or a painful rupture. In the case of Mrs. Moore, de- parture and death indicate the deleterious disillusionment that social and per- sonal intimacy has generated. Although her character disavows a colonial iden- tity, and turns into a deified Indian fetish - ' Esmiss Esmoor' - invoked by the crowd in the courtroom, her death comes as the direct drawback of that affilia- tion. She is the scapegoat of an imperial suppression and massacre of an East- West espousal. The Collector's headstrong assertion - "I have never known any- thing but disaster result when English people and Indians attempt to be intimate socially. Intercourse, yes. Courtesy, by all means. Intimacy, never, never." (PI 174) - exemplifies such a colonial extirpation of the possibility of cross-cultural rapprochement. Aziz and Fielding's friendship has been poisoned, and brought to a stand- still, when the latter is distracted from his friend's triumph, and immersed in his support of Adela Quested. This humane action cannot be dissociated from an overriding national consciousness. "The English always stick together! That was the criticism. Nor was it unjust. Fielding shared it himself, and knew that if some misunderstanding occurred, and an attack was made on the girl by his al- lies, he would be obliged to die in her defence" (PI 235). In the same vein, Aziz's transformation into an anti-British, after his exculpation from the charge of sexual assault, widens the gap between him and his English friend. Blinded by racial hatred, he falls in the snare of misunderstanding and thoughtlessly jilts his loving English friend. Although this cloud of misunderstanding dissipates at the end - Aziz's gratefulness to Adela Quested, and his reconciliation with Fielding - the path of friendship cannot be retraced and parting remains the in- evitable outcome. The impossibility of suturing the past splits points to the pro- fundity of the social dichotomy and the vulnerability of racial pride. "All stupid misunderstandings had been cleared up, but socially they had no meeting-place" (PI 312). Their self-willed attempts to refurbish their old love and intimacy prove to be literally groundless as the Indian space refuses to yield to a safe foundation of social intercourse. They can do nothing but contemplate each other's goodwill from a distance. Fielding's old enthusiasm withers. "Would he today defy his own people for the sake of a stray Indian? Aziz was a memento, a trophy, they were proud of each other, yet they must inevitably part" (PI 313). The bitter unanswerability of cross-cultural friendship - "Why can't we be friends now?" (PI 316) - while being broached since the beginning of the narra- 54</page><page sequence="19">tive (Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali "were discussing as to whether or not it is possible to be friends with an Englishman" [PI 33]), is ironically cancelled by Dr. Aziz upon whom the drama of cross-cultural friendship is enacted. "Why talk about the English? Brrrr. . . ! Why be either friends with the fellows or not friends? Let us shut them out and be jolly" (PI 35). He is obliged to espouse an anti-imperial doctrine after his racial humiliation in the Marabar episode. This tendency is what problematizes his relationship with the liberal-minded Field- ing. The narrative turns to the study of friendship in the context of the colonial, vertiginous present, and the unimpeachable national consciousness and affilia- tion of each party. The narrative's undecidability as to the conclusion of the po- litical conflict of colonialism is eluded by a deferral of cross-cultural friendship to a vague future of decolonization, and its banishment to a neutral space that is unstained by the wrongs and abuses of colonialism. The incommensurability of space and time - "No, not yet," "No, not there" (PI 316) - is the only ascer- tained conclusion the narrative can notify. The narrative stretch that lies between Mahmoud All's sad interjection - "It is impossible here, Aziz!" (PI 34) - and the sky's momentous conjecture - "No, not there." - is an erratic experimenta- tion of friendship on the Indian land, which continually regresses to the same thwarting conclusion. The novel closes with the deferral of the question of cross-cultural friend- ship to the impending era of decolonisation. After Aziz's victory over Adela Quested, with the alliance of Fielding, their friendship can only relapse in an insipid coldness. "They had conquered but were not to be crowned" (PI 268). The remorseless dethronement of their friendship indicates an inherent brittle- ness. However, the linkage of the crowning of friendship with the coming inde- pendence of India - "and then . . . you and I shall be friends" (PI 316) - provides an optimistic version of the end of colonization; an irenical burial of the hatchet and a condonation of past abuses and antagonism. The swift action of half-kissing denotes such an optimistic deferral, but the indefiniteness and vagueness of this future taints the hope of colonial disentanglement and recon- ciliation with a pessimistic hue. Birth of Nationhood and Patterns of Resistance: Aziz's character develops from a detached, politically unaffected Indian to a zealous insurgent against British rule, and a nationalist-oriented thinker. The mental and physical lethargy that he wallows in, in his relative's house, mediates a sense of his peaceful detachment. "He lay in a trance, sensuous but healthy, through which the talk of the others did not seem particularly sad . . . Delicious indeed to lie on the veranda with the moon rising in front and the servants pre- paring dinner behind, and no trouble happening" (PI 33). Aziz's listless and 55</page><page sequence="20">oblivious prostration, and his refusal to participate in a painful political conver- sation, denotes his rapturous sensation of uninvolvement, even if it is temporary and enhanced by the ecstasy of smoking.17 In the episode of the trial, the novel flares up into an open denunciation of the British Raj. The recrudescence of the Indian vehemence against British rule comes as the climax of the trial, as Aziz's case takes national dimensions: he and Adela Quested lose their identity during the legal proceedings - their names are substituted by euphemistic signs - and as - such, they acquire an identity that encompasses the whole race. One stands for the seditious, evil-doing Indian; the other, for the colonialist victimized by the resurgent barbarity of the native population. No wonder the English are re- minded of the historical black spot of the Indian Mutiny. "The crime was even worse than they had supposed - the unspeakable limit of cynicism, untouched since 1857" (PI 194). One is reminded of Ronny's racist and mistrustful judge- ment of the Indians at the Bridge Party: "Most of the people you see here are seditious at heart, and the rest'd run squealing" (PI 59). Ronny's official rela- tionship with Indians explains his vision of the Anglo-Indian interaction as im- mutably based on enmity and intransigence; or, as Forster succinctly puts it, "Where there is officialism every human relationship suffers" (PI 215). British officialism, on the one hand, and the sporadic flaring of Indian violence and irate resistance to colonization, on the other, widen the divide between the East and the West, and spawn the various figures of irreconcilability, and the recur- rent narrative tropes of the eternal estrangement and incompatibility of the two peoples and cultures. Forster concludes the court scene by a frustrating sense of muddle and in- distinctness. The imagery of the Indian crowd suggests an impenetrable chaos and a maddening alienness for the uncontrollably swept Adela Quested. The faint, indescribable smell of the bazaar invaded her, sweeter than a London slum, yet more disquieting: a tuft of scented cotton wool, wedged in an old man's ear, fragments of pan between his black teeth, odorous powders, oil - the Scented East of tradition, but blended with human sweat, as if a great king had been entangled in ignominy and could not free himself, or as if the heat of the sun had boiled and fried all the glories of the earth into a single mess. (PI 233) A sudden loss of sensation invades Adela in the midst of this Indian throng. The description does not magnify the indistinct smithereens of the imbroglio; it fur- ther jumbles them and knocks them out of shape. A temporary invisibility and unconsciousness disintegrate Adela's body and melt her sensations in this mad- dening whirlpool. "They paid no attention to her. They shook hands over her shoulder, shouted through her body" (PI 233). Her body becomes a diaphanous screen through which Indians can outreach each other, which indicates a trium- phant dissolution or a flighty ignorance of the colonizer's bulky presence. 56</page><page sequence="21">Crowd imagery mediates a sense of the muddle of India, as well as a turbulent uprising that justifies the Indian lack of political awareness and organization. The liberation of Dr. Aziz, which is the bathos of the British self-victimization and martyrdom, already gives way to an Indian rout and demagogic flare, which is so much redolent of the stereotypical rambunctiousness of the colonized. The narrative, therefore, does not acknowledge the natives any mature aptitude to rule themselves. Both the frenzied turbulence and the boisterous puerility of the Indian outbursts are narrative hints at the unruliness of the colonized and their inability to organize their resistance to British rule. Instead of auguring a bright future of independence, the narrative wavers on the edge of colonial plausibility. Forster satirizes the Indian aptitude for self-rule and national unification through an emphasis on the notion of caste and cultural diversity and intractabil- ity. He represents the Indian religious sects as eternally at loggerheads, and re- mains pessimistic, even sarcastic, about their national union; "a worrying Com- mittee of Notables" is his description of a nationalist organization of six Indian sects. "As long as someone abused the English, all went well, but nothing con- structive had been achieved, and if the English were to leave India the commit- tee will vanish also" (PI 1 19-20). Forster plays down the nationalist develop- ment of the Indian political awareness, and represents it as a historical accrual of colonial abuse. The narrative underrates the cultural and political solidarity of other peoples, seen to be brought to maturity and civilization under the auspices of colonization. "India a nation! What an apotheosis! Last comer to the drab nineteenth-century sisterhood!" (PI 315), says Fielding caustically voicing the demeaning perception of imperialist regimes of the development of its colonies. One is reminded of the metonymical reduction of the mimic colonized "as a subject of a difference that is almost the same, but not quite"™ extended here to a national diapason. India's copying of the political model of the European na- tionalities, and the political terminology of Western statecraft is bitingly depre- cated. Aziz's panegyric entertainment of the idea of the Indian unity - "It will be arranged - a conference of oriental statesmen." (PI 315) - is slighted and dis- missed by Fielding as unfeasible; a chimerical aspiration of an Indian national stirring prodded by colonial vituperation. Aziz's chivalrous outbreak at the end of the novel enhances the whimsical nature of the Indian nationalism. Forster seems to prolong the verbal dual be- tween him and Fielding in the hope of reaching some reconci liatory ending to the colonial present. He wavers between colonization and decolonization, both of which baffle the argumentative persuasiveness of each party. The narrative inconclusivity at the end mirrors the colonial trifling with the Indian autonomy, or as Said explains: The sense that India and Britain are opposed nations (though their posi- tions overlap), is played down, muffled, frittered away . . . Forster' s India 57</page><page sequence="22">is so affectionately personal and so remorselessly metaphysical that his view of Indians as a nation contending for sovereignty with Britain is not very serious, or even respectful.19 As he extends his psychedelic imagination to the uttermost depths of the Indian character and space, Forster fails to value an Indian national aspiration. He rein- forces, instead, a nationalist vision of British imperial legitimacy, by portraying an India that cannot dispense with British regulatory intervention. India's suc- cess and achievement is always measured on the Western scale. Conclusion Immersed in the infinitesimally personal and humane, A Passage to India allows some genuine interactions between the colonial and the native, and the establishment of some love-hued friendships. The colonial bridge is predicated on the assumption that the English and the Indians can criss-cross the enchanting path of friendship so long as they can ignore cultural difference and colonial grudge. But such fictional allowances for well-intentioned, irenical crossings of the racial barriers are thwarted by a plethoric narrative on geographical and cul- tural repulsion and mystery. This tendency situates Forster's narrative in a mod- ernist tradition where literary writing is taken "from the triumphalist experience of imperialism into the extremes of self-consciousness, discontinuity, self- referential ity, and corrosive irony."20 Forster could deploy his narrative space to subdue the extensive geography of the Indian land, and to convey the polyphony of a diverse cultural expression. But each expression, however curiously sincere, is hemmed in a national and cultural perspective, that distorts their intàctness and mature sophistication, and confirms the Western priority. The narrative can- not openly denounce colonization and recommend its ending. Although it per- ceives the looming era of decolonization, it can only deploy Fielding's voice as a damper on the flighty spirits of the nascent Indian nationalism, and as a deri- sive witness of the prospect of British colonial retreat, and the Indian take-over and independence.
