In The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt famously writes about the role that consumer goods play "within this world of durable things": Needed by our bodies and produced by its laboring, but without stability of their own, these things for incessant consumption appear and disappear in an environment of things that are not consumed but used, and to which, as we use them, we become used and accustomed. As such, they give rise to the familiarity of the world, its customs and habits of intercourse be- hveen men and things as well as behveen men and men. (94) A work of art, Arendt later argues, is a particular type of object: one that strictly speaking, is without utility and that, because it is unique, can only be arbitrarily priced when it en- ters the exchange market. It represents a special form of stability through its claim to per- manence. It is connected to the transcendent because it has its origins in human thought, but it is aligned with the world of material objects through the means by which thought is fabricated into substance: "the primordial instrument of human hands" (169). By these standards, a forgery has only the most tenuous claim to be a work of art. To be sure, a successful forgery demands from its creator - or would manufacturer be the better term? - considerable dexterity in manipulating line, color, and form; in wielding a brush or chisel; in aging or preparing the requisite materials. These finely honed skills involve touch and co-ordination, as well as precise observation: they require combining the attributes of practical artist and knowledgeable historian. But eviscerated of imagina- tion, creativity, and above all of originality, a completed forgery is unmistakably a com- modity rather than art, one that fulfills to an almost parodie degree Marx's representation of the commodity as something that suppresses the memory of its own process. Nonethe- less, even if it lacks a reliable history of its own, it is a highly useful vehicle for the trans- mission of narratives about its own and other cultures. Forgeries, as Aviva Briefel tells us right at the beginning of The Deceivers: Art Forgery and Identity in the Nineteenth Century, are objects that are notoriously hard to pin down, to define. There is something of the uncanny about them. They lack a stable human source. The truth of their existence is not readily available to the senses, but is revealed by the back of the canvas, by exploring under the surface of the paint. Not what they appear to be, forgeries simultaneously draw upon and undermine the various forms of authority that are called upon to authorize their existence and to give them value. As Briefel's knowledgeable and suggestive study shows, the proliferation of forgeries in Victorian England, France, and (although she writes less about this) America - in houses and museums as well as in fiction - points not just to a considerable market for these ersatz art objects, but also to the importance of the various forms of human interaction that sus- tained their circulation. The "story of the fake in the nineteenth century," as Briefel nicely puts it, "is one of subjects who depend on objects that betray them, of humans who define themselves through things that lie" (18). More than this, her study suggests, even if it never quite spells out, that we need to think hard about the implications of a period that</page><page sequence="2">170 NOVEL I FALL 2007 was itself fascinated and troubled by the slippery concept of authenticity - and the degree to which such a thing may, or may not, matter. The nineteenth century saw a huge rise in the production and dissemination of fake paintings and antiquarian artifacts. These took many forms, from exact replicas - of canvases or coins or prehistoric flints - through supposedly newly discovered creations, to the transformation of an old object without significant provenance into a signed mas- terpiece or an alleged portrait. There was only a sliver of a dividing line between forgery and restoration. One of the many strengths of The Deceivers is the way in which it reveals the paradoxical object - the forgery itself - to be the site of many further paradoxes, each in their turn revelatory about the priorities and anxieties of the Victorian culture that fos- tered the practice of forgery. Of shaky value in their own right, forgeries provide a sure guide to what - in its genuine form - counts as valuable. Learning to recognize a fake can be a valuable educational experience. Forgers embodied bourgeois ideals of industrious- ness, specialist knowledge, and thrift. Dealers, rather than forgers, were frequently seen as the true criminals, reducing aesthetics to corrupt materialism, and Jewish dealers, above all, emerged as scapegoats for the trade in fakes. The cliché of an avaricious type was elaborated upon in order to reflect the growing anxiety about Jews gaining power within the art world. Other well-engrained middle-class social assumptions emerge through the refusal of critics to believe that a woman could be a forger. Reluctant to believe her capable of stra- tegic deception (Briefel makes excellent use of John Kucich's understanding of the relationship between gender and lying here), Victorians relegated her to the level of "copyist" - something that demeaned, not elevated her. In the overlap between fakes and people, forgeries themselves tend to be gendered female and, as such, play a part in a readily recognizable pattern of homosocial alliances forged through the exchange of ob- jects. The metaphor of aesthetic fakery, of course, is readily transferable to any spurious, deceptive human individual - especially one who seeks to conceal and lie about his or her social origins. In many different ways, the forgery provides us with a sustained set of ex- amples, in both aesthetic discourse and in fiction, of commodity objects that completely break down the boundaries between people and things. As befits a subject with such overlapping and interchangeable resonances, Aviva Briefel's writing combines argumentative clarity with linguistic subtlety. Although she is careful not to overwork her sense of the playful, her occasional puns enact her awareness of the pleasures of stylistic individuality in authorship - pleasures of a kind denied to the forger. Her five main chapters authoritatively present a wide-ranging discussion of the debates surrounding her major topics: the uneven relationship between responses to the forger and the copyist; the reciprocal exchanges (whether of objects or aesthetic knowl- edge) between connoisseurs and forgers; the controversies that surrounded restoration and the cultural authority of a nation that was often at stake in the practice; the prevalence and role of the Jewish art dealer; and the wearing of paste jewels. This was one significant form of material fakery that was open to women, even if the stakes were rather different - artificial gems were not generally intended to delude buyers, but to help buyers delude others. Each of the general sections is followed by a more detailed reading: Noémie Nioche, in Henry James's The American, provides a nexus for discussing the female copy- ist; Oscar Wilde's "The Portrait of Mr. W. H." neatly dramatizes male alliances consolidating around a highly spurious art object; and George du Maurier's Trilby not</page><page sequence="3">KATE FLINT | FAKING IT 171 only provides us with a novel where forgery lies at the heart of a thriving art world, and with Svengali as a type of Jewish dealer, but with Trilby herself as a ready-made fake, "an anthropomorphic version of the lifeless objects that nineteenth-century experts feminized in their efforts to protect their own secret identities and desires" (136). In the previous chapter, Briefel persuasively argues that Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun is a text that expresses American ambiguities about being involved in the restoration of the art works from another country's past. Once again, she brings out the paradoxical: lacking ancient art work of its own (this is before the repair or fakery of Anasazi pots was an issue), the United States saw a chance to claim a place on the cultural map through practicing restoration. Yet, at the same time, authority derived from repair- ing artifacts from another nation's past is based on unsteady foundations. As Briefel points out, The Marble Faun itself shares characteristics with a restored object, being a combination of real and fabricated knowledge, combined in a fractured narrative. But does this mean that it becomes, as Briefel suggests, "something of a fake in itself" (115)? I think not: it's not as though Hawthorne were setting out to emulate Thomas Chatterton's fabrication of medieval verse. Rather, Hawthorne is inviting his readers to share in the pleasures of a willing suspension of disbelief. Yet The Deceivers gains, overall, by introducing the discussion of fictional form along- side that of art works. The fifth chapter pivots on a fascinating discussion of Henry James's "Paste," a* story involving a complex set of substitutions of faux and real pearls. Another, external substitution is at stake. In his Preface to the volume in which "Paste" appeared, James tells us that he borrowed the idea for his plot from Guy de Maupassant's "La Parure" and, as Briefel tells us, his own replacement of diamonds with pearls is a tell- ing one, since pearls, among all jewels, are uniquely supposed to take on something of the history, the attributes, indeed the bodily presence of their owners. But there is a further deception, or omission of information. As Briefel demonstrates, James's tale is in fact textual bric-a-brac, its seeds found not just in "La Parure," but in Maupassant's "Les Bijoux" as well - a reference that James suppresses, whether consciously or not. This is not, of course, to call James's work plagiarism, a practice related to forgery, but different in that a writer looks to aggrandize, not conceal, him or herself through authorship. Rather, it shows very well how forgery is inseparably caught up with questions of identity, whether within the substance of the text, or - by extension, and as if by contagion - within the history of the text itself. For forgery, in its many forms, inevitably makes one ask not just what constitutes originality and authenticity in the first place, but about how one might recognize it. A forgery is intended to deceive and thus differs from copies, parodies, imitations, replicas, souvenirs, and the mass productions of an age of mechanical reproduction. But might it not be spottable by an astute - an intuitively astute - viewer? At the beginning of Blink. The Paver of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell tells how in the 1980s, the status of a Getty kouros seemed highly suspect, at a glance, to classical experts, who, de- spite the apparent evidence of scientific tests, felt an "intuitive repulsion" to the marble statue (3-8). They were, of course, proved right in their suspicions. Briefel sidesteps John Ruskin's understanding of art as revealing the character of its maker and makes little of Walter Benjamin's concept of the aura. Such terminology, like Arendt's understanding of art works as unique products of human thought and feeling, points to an enduring belief that a true work of art possesses an ineffable, hard-to-name quality of some kind. It has, of</page><page sequence="4">172 NOVEL I FALL 2007 course, been the task of much subsequent art (and of art criticism) to call this belief into question and to equate thought with cerebral conceptualization rather than with intense inwardness. Nonetheless, the final paradox of the forgery that we need to take into con- sideration is this: that despite its many evasive and nebulous characteristics, the one fea- ture that it lacks - that identifies it as a forgery, indeed - is precisely the ability to stimulate that sudden, indefinable sense of recognition in the viewer. This insight lies, like the identity of a forgery itself, under the visible surface of Briefel's excellent and highly readable study - forgery's unspoken power was to buttress the intangible values that were felt to inhere within genuine art and that defied material definition. Superficially, forgery would appear to have a capacity for radical subversion, duping its willing purchasers and confounding aesthetic mystique, its illusory value evaporating with its exposure. Yet, rather like Bakhtin's carnivalesque, it is ultimately to be understood as a type of controlled transgression that ended up consolidating the Victorian middle-class ideologies on which it so readily fed. kate flint, Rutgers University</page></plain_text>
