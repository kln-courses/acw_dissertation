<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacred Time, Sacred Space: Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, edited by Barry M. Gittlen. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2002. xii + 228 pp., 7 figures. Cloth. $29.50. Sacred Time is a collection of 12 articles from the "Ar- chaeology and Religion of Israel" sessions of the ASOR annual meetings from 1993 to 1996. The book holds four parts, followed by Authors and Scripture indexes. The ref- erences are not consistent (notes and final lists), but the text is well edited and the bibliography is mostly rich and updated. Part I, "Charting the Course," starts with a general opening by J. Z. Smith (pp. 3-10). The core is W. G. De- ver's "Theology, Philology and Archaeology-In the Pur- suit of Ancient Israelite Religion" (pp. 11-34), portions of which were published earlier (p. 29 n. 6). Dever's polemic against philologists, biblical theologists, and the "Copen- hagen" school is well known, so while his current essay is not very new, it serves well as a general introduction. Z. Zevit's response, "Philology and Archaeology" (pp. 35- 42), defends a few aspects of the philological and biblical theology approaches, and defines three types of data: lit- erary-intellectual, artifactual, and "religiological" (p. 37). Zevit presents three cases where archaeology alone has "major bearing on various aspects of Israelite religion" (p. 41), but all are problematic, since either this "major bearing" is not proven (cases 1, 3) or does not exist (case 2, because Ekron concerns Philistines, not Israelites). The lively, lecture-style wording ("we think that something is amiss with your work," "buzz-word," "zilch"), does not cover the lack of editing or updating. Indeed, Dever, un- like Zevit, updated references thoroughly, and even in- cluded Zevit's 2001 monograph (p. 33). Detailed review of Zevit's work should be based on this recent book, rather than on a short 1993 lecture. Part II, "Prayers in Clay: A Multidisciplinary Ap- proach to Figurines" is the weakest section, chiefly due to K. Van der Toorn's "Israelite Figurines: A View from the Texts" (pp. 45-62). The title exemplifies the problems. Our conception of "figurines" in the sense of "small figures" does not exist in the Hebrew texts under discus- sion. We have "figure, idol" (POD, D ), but not "figurine," and perhaps the ancients did not make clear distinctions based on size. Few ambiguous OT terms (such as Tera- phim) may mean "figurines"; however, this is not proven. There can be no view "from" the texts-only an inter- pretation of the texts. Furthermore, what is an "Israelite figurine"? There were separate Iron Age II kingdoms (Is- rael, Judah) with distinctive assemblages. For the Iron Age I, we have relatively few figurines, but hardly any- thing "from the texts" (leaving aside the debate about their historicity). Some of these problems are raised in J. M. Sasson's gentle response (pp. 63-70). However, Sas- son believes that "van der Toorn does us a great service by suggesting diverse contexts for the use of figurines" (p. 65). This great service was made decades ago by Ucko (1968), Voigt (1983), and others, not mentioned by van der Toorn. Part III, "The Mythology of Sacred Space: Structure and Structuralism" (pp. 73-135) opens in Zevit's introduc- tory note, "Preamble to a Temple Tour" (pp. 73-81). Zevit divides sacred space into three facets: geographical, the- matic, and mythic-symbolic. This is not a simple division,</page><page sequence="2">100 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 329 but it merits a separate discussion. Bloch-Smith's "So- lomon's Temple: The Politics of Ritual Space" (pp. 83-94) discusses courtyard objects (mekonot, yam, etc.) and inte- rior decoration/objects (especially cherubs and menorot). She notes the lack of archaeological remains, but does not mention the question of the text's reliability. For example, were the stands really "significantly larger than ancient Near Eastern parallels" (p. 90), even "exaggerated" (p. 91), or is it only an exaggeration of the writers? What Bloch- Smith presents as distinctive features of Solomon's Tem- ple (p. 90) represent merely a lack of features, i.e., nega- tive evidence, hardly conclusive when dealing with a brief text of questionable historical reliability. More recent pub- lications are missing, e.g., iconographical studies (Keel and Uehlinger 1998), or the debate about Yahweh's images (Na'aman 1999). Still, Solomon's Temple is a fascinating subject (cf. Zwickel 1990), and many of Bloch-Smith's conclusions are agreeable. S. Gitin, "The Four Homed Al- tar and Sacred Space: An Archaeological Perspective" (pp. 95-123) is an updated and expanded treatment of 45 Iron Age II stone altars. Gitin offers a tour de force against Ha- ran (who rejected their identification as incense altars). It settles the issue, as does a recently published stone stand from Transjordan, inscribed "mqtr" (Dion and Daviau 2000). Gitin sees a "ubiquitous Israelite-type four horned altar," adopted in seventh-century Ekron by "displaced Is- raelite craftsmen" after Assyria conquered Israel (p. 116). Other scenarios are possible. We lack evidence of depor- tations from Israel to Ekron, and refugees from Israel would have more likely fled to Judah. It is possible that such altars were used all over the area and are not exclu- sively "Israelite." Their relative lack in seventh-century Israel/Judah (but cf. Arad) is perhaps related to archaeo- logical reasons. The use of foreign cult objects at Ekron, such as an Egyptian sistrum or an Ishtar medallion, does not prove "the presence of foreign cult practices" (p. 116), since a foreign object could be adopted and used for local practices. At Ekron, some of the altars were found in industrial and domestic contexts, showing the difficulty of defining "sacred space." This is another point of interest in this excellent paper. B. A. Levine's "Ritual as Symbol: Modes of Sacrifice in Israelite Religion" (pp. 125-43) closes this part. Levine discusses modes of sacrifice in the Bible (zebah, minha, toda, etc.) and suggests a develop- ment from presentation offerings to burnt offerings on altars (p. 132). The references are thin, but this is a brief summary of a vast field, treated by Levine in 1974 and 1993 (p. 126 n. 1, p. 134 n. 5). Part IV treats "Death in the Life of Israel." Bloch- Smith gives a sketch of 20th-century views on the subject, marking the recent shift in favor of those who minimize the role of the dead in ancient Israel. This does not accord with her former studies, so "one may wonder if theologi- cal forces are at work in the current backlash against the cult of the dead" (p. 142). The following two papers prove that this allegation is unfair, and that "minimalism" is by now not a "nascent shift" but a leading position. W. T. Pitard's marvelous treatment on "Tombs and Offerings: Archaeological Data and Comparative Methodology" (pp. 145-68) shows how archaeologists misinterpreted simple remains at Ebla and Ugarit as evidence for "cult of the dead," without factual basis. Everyone should embrace his call for a much more careful attitude. T. J. Lewis's "How Far Can Texts Take Us?" (pp. 169-217) opens in a too praiseful view of archaeology's powers for understanding burial and death (pp. 169-76). The middle part (pp. 176- 86), though, is a well-balanced, judicious, and valuable summary of the texts (mainly biblical), followed by de- bate with the minimalists, especially Schmidt (pp. 186- 200). This is justified because Schmidt is, indeed, a "credible and astute challenge" (p. 189). Lewis can live with D. Pardee's more moderate minimalism (p. 203). I fully agree, and thanks to Pitard and Lewis, we can all live wonderfully with part IV of Sacred Times. The preface (p. xi) and the back-cover slip raise our expectations: "a concentrated coordinated effort by a vari- ety of scholars . . .must be orchestrated to achieve a new synthesis, that is, to clearly assess and understand the problems, chart new approaches to the issues and reach possibly new conclusions" (p. xi). Yet, as a whole the book does not break new methodological grounds. It reflects lectures given as early as 1993, partly surpassed by more recent or comprehensive studies (often, by the same con- tributors). More critically, Sacred Time does not chart the discussed field as a whole. The participants are Ameri- cans, with a European grain of salt for seasoning. Con- tributions by Near Eastern archaeologists, for example (Mazar, Stern, Ben-Tor, Zertal, etc.), are lacking. A list of all the participants in the 1993-1996 sessions would have been helpful. Still, the book is a very useful contribution to a fascinating field of study, and it will serve a large and varied audience of readers. More than anything else, Sacred Time demonstrates the elevated position of ASOR's annual meetings. Few conferences in our discipline, if any, can boast a similar concentration of highly esteemed scholars, in just one ses- sion during four years. Not under every green tree, but in ASOR's pleasant annual meetings, our profession finds a "high-place" for our time.
