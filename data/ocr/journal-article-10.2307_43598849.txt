In Peru, the search for revenues during the past decade has taken a significant toll on the nation's natural and cultural resources, a trend that culminated in the recent controversy over the Lima government's plans to expand tourist infrastructure at the Inca "palace" of Machu Picchu, arguably South America's greatest tourist attraction. Yet while a political storm drawing international interest raged over Machu Picchu, a quieter but similar dilemma had begun emerging decades earlier at another remarkable ancient settlement in the eastern Andean cloud forests of northern Peru. The equally spectacular Chachapoyas site of Gran Pajatén was targeted for tourism development soon after its 1964 discovery. The site has so far been spared de- velopment by virtue of its remote lo- cation and difficult access, and its in- corporationin 1983 within a protected area, the Rio Abiseo National Park (Figure 1). This is indeed fortunate, as the political forces seeking to turn Gran Pajatén into an economic asset have so far failed to understand the fragile nature of this cultural resource. Several articles have highlighted threats to the Rio Abiseo National Park as a protected area (Leo 1992; Young et al. 1994), but the following article details problems that distinguish the conservation status of the park's archaeological resources. My perspective is derived from par- ticipation in archaeological investi- gations within the park since 1985, and from avid observation of political developments affecting both research and conservation. Most of Gran Pa- jatén's problems epitomize a single dilemma facing cultural resource managers in national parks and pre- serves around the world. How can we facilitate public access to fragile ar- chaeological sites without fatally compromising their historical and scientific integrity? Gran Pajatén The archaeological site of Gran Pajatén is a prehispanic settlement perched on a high terraced ridge top 16 The George Wright FORUM</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation Volume 16 • Number 4 1999 17 Figure 1.

The Montecristo lies within the Abiseo River drainage, which empties into the Huallabamba tributary of the Central Huallaga. At 2,850 m, Gran Pajatén lies deep within the tropical Andean cloud forest where temperature averages between 6 and 12 degrees Celsius, and annual precipitation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 mm. Rain and thick mists are almost daily occurrences, even during the dry season between May and October. Dense forest covers masonry constructions at Gran Pajatén and other archaeological sites within the surrounding valley. This region is mostly uninhabited today, as the rugged terrain, high humidity and unstable soils of the upper forests have been unattractive to Andean farmers. Government agencies responsible for evaluating natural resources describe the upper forests as virtually useless from an economic standpoint (ONERN 1976). Consequently, both scholars and lay persons tend to assume that the region has always been uninhabited, perhaps utilized only sporadically by temporary or transient populations. Gran Pajatén has been known to science only since the American ex- plorer Gene Savoy (1965) publicized its discovery by local villagers from Pataz. Most extraordinary about the site was the unexpected sophistication of its architecture given its remote location within one of Earth's most hostile erivironments. The complex of at least 26 stone buildings, most of which are circular, crowns a crescent- shaped ridgetop hewn into ascending terraces, skirted by staircases, and entirely paved with slate slabs (Figure 3). Ornamenting the building walls are inlaid slate mosaics depicting a variety of geometric shapes, bird motifs, and rows of human figures each with sculpted sandstone-tenoned heads (Figures 4 and 5). The mountain slopes below the settlement are also terraced, giving the entire built complex a total extent estimated at 50 ha. The exact size of the settlement remains unknown, but it does not exceed 2 ha. The interest awakened by the dis- covery of this "lost city" brought about two government-sponsored expedi- tions during 1965 and 1966 led by high government officials, including several from Peru's tourism industry sector. The Peruvian military, especially the Air Force, had a celebrated role in clearing the forest from the ridgetop, building a landing site, and providing helicopter access for the government officials. A popular image of Gran Pajatén subsequently reproduced in widely distributed posters and pamphlets shows the Peruvian flag flying atop the ridge where it was planted within Building No. 1, the most prominent construc- tion at the site. As news of the spec- tacular discovery spread around the globe, Gran Pajatén became a source 18 The George Wright FORUM</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation Figure 3.

Its discovery coincided with then-PresidentF ernan- do Belaúnde Terry's social programs to promote colonization of the jungle. The site was regarded as monumental testimony to the fortitude and indomitable spirit of the ancient Peruvians who conquered an environment which has repeatedly thwarted contemporary attempts at colonization. During their brief visits, expedition personnel and supporting Pataz villagers cleared vegetation over an estimated area of 6,000 sq m and neatly stacked the collected masonry rubble lying within and around the buildings. The helicopter-landing site was built on top of buildings at the north end of the site, and a camp with latrines was established along the northeastern edge. Expedition personnel produced several magazine articles, a few brief scientific reports (Pimentel 1967; Rojas 1967), a TV documentaryby the British Broadcasting Corporation, and, most importantly, one monograph (Bonavia 1968) describing the results of concurrent archaeological investiga- tions at the site. Always one of Peru's most outspoken scholars, Bonavia was especially critical of expedition activities that damaged the site's con- structions. The plan to prepare Gran Volume 16 • Number 4 1999 19 »</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation Pajatén for use as a tourist attraction was quickly forgotten in Peru's shifting political landscape. Between 1966 and 1985, numerous expeditions of tourists and ar- chaeologists visited Gran Pajatén and reported other archaeological sites (Deza 1976; Kauffmann 1980; Leo and Ortiz 1982). Largely due to the efforts of Leo, Ortiz, and other dedi- cated Peruvian naturalists, the region was set aside as a national parkin 1983. The creation of the Rio Abiseo National Park provided a refuge for the endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (previously thought extinct) and for other rare and threatened animals and ecological systems. The park's area of 274,520 ha is delimited by the natural boundaries of the Abiseo River watershed (Mendoza and Lozano 1:997). At 4,200 m elevation, its western edge coincides with the political boundary separating La Lib- ertad and San Martin departments (technically referred to as Regiones), while its eastern boundary lies 70 lin- ear km distant within San Martin's lowland tropical forest at 500 m ele- vation. The World Wildlife Fund has helped fund a staff of locally recruited park guards and an administrative director that succeeded in removing livestock and discouraging the frequent burning of the forest. Although the park lies completely within San Martin Figure 4.

Topographic barriers in the lower Abiseo valley have so far thwarted twentieth-century attempts to create access to Gran Pajatén from San Martin by means other than helicopter. In 1985, scientists from the Uni- versity of Colorado-Boulder, Yale University, the University of Trujillo, the Asociación Peruana para la Con- servación de la Naturaleza (APECO), and the National Agrarian University- La Molina began a much publicized, long-term multidisciplinary research project in the park that included the identification of more sites, as well as test excavations at La Playa, Gran Pajatén, Manachaqui Cave, and several others (Lennon et al. 1989; Church 1991, 1994, 1996, 1999). The new data undermine accepted theories that characterize cloud forest sites such as Gran Pajatén as late- fifteenth-century agricultural colonies established by highland populations who were forced into the forest by environmental or demographic stress or were seeking access to lowland crop Volume 16 • Number 4 1999 21</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation production zones (e.g., Bonavia and Ravines 1967; Bonavia 1968; Kauff- mann 1992; Moseley 1992). There is now overwhelming evidence that in- digenous cloud forest societies (1) have utilized the forests since 8,000 BC; (2) setded deep within the forest at Gran Pajatén as early as 200 BC; and (3) built many settlements far larger than Gran Pajatén, indicating that a thriving population numbered in the many thousands on the eve of the Spanish conquest. Yet despite the scientific theories devised to explain cloud forest settlement, an aura of mystery, mostly perpetuated by the Peruvian media, continues to surround Gran Pajatén. Historical Perspective In response to several different factors, a predicament began to emerge at Pajatén during the early 1990s. An undercurrent of tension between scientists and administrators on the one hand, and local politicians and developers on the other, had already become evident owing to the Ministry of Agriculture's closing of the park to public access in recognition of the region's environmental fragility. Consequently, Gran Pajatén and the Colorado-led research project became "political footballs." During the 1989 elections, political candidates from Pataz drew attention to themselves by denouncing the looting of Gran Pajatén by "foreigners with backpacks." Simultaneously, several original members of the 1960s government expeditions publicly decried the site's "abandonment" and claimed that the foreign research project had done nothing (e.g., Mejia 1990). Antagonisms escalated as eco tourism entrepreneurs teamed with San Martin politicians to undermine APEC O's credibility by publicly accusing the association of embezzling research funds (e.g. Radio Programas del Peru 1990). Further, the pro- development faction repeatedly claimed that plant regrowth was destroying Gran Pajatén's buildings, which urgently required cleaning. The mounting clamor culminated in a 1990 re-enactment of the "con- quest" of Gran Pajatén, led again by the Air Force and facilitated by a tele- vision crew from the Peruvian weekly television news magazine Panorama . Soldiers again cleared the 1960s heli- copter pad and other portions of the site, set up camp in the same location, and scraped vegetation off of the building walls with machetes, hands and fingernails. These loud pro- ceedings were witnessed from a dis- tance by Peruvian biologists attempting field studies in the valley below Gran Pajatén. The television spectacular aired on 10 August 1990. Shortly afterward, newspapers informed by the biologists reported the illegal intrusion into the national park, and noted that the expedition not only lacked proper authorization, but failed to notify park administrators (Expreso 1990). To assess the new damage done by 22 The George Wright FORUM</page><page sequence="8">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation the 1990 expedition, the National Institute of Culture (INC) office in Trujillo sent an archaeologist to join park administrators at the site. Among the damages reported at Gran Pajatén, it was observed that some sculptures were indeed missing, and that the sandstone-tenoned heads were eroding rapidly without the cover of vegetation (Briseño 1991). It was also observed that every cleaning of the mosses and lichens removes surface grains from the moist sandstone sculptures. There were, on the other hand, some positive developments about the same time, most notably UNESCO's recognition of Rio Abiseo National Park as a World Heritage Site, first in 1990 for its natural features and again in 1992 for its cultural attributes. In 1991, the University of Colorado and the Fun- dación Peruana para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (FPCN) jointly published a management plan for Rio Abiseo National Park (University of Colorado and FPCN 1991). This was followed by an international sym- posium in Lima sponsoredby APECO and the World Wildlife Fund. There, scientists and administrators united to discuss the results of the research undertaken since 1985, and make recommendations for the future (Aguilar 1992). Despite these devel- opments, however, Gran Pajatén was increasingly viewed as an untapped economic resource, especially by politicians in San Martin who felt more strongly than ever that their departmental authorities should be guiding the destiny of the site and the national park. The dismemberment in 1992 of the Sendero Luminoso and Tupac Amaru revolutionary movements cleared the way fora national economic expansion that further stimulated entrepreneurs and politicians to seek access to the park. Intense political pressure now originated from the department of San Martin, where the regional economy has long been isolated and depressed. Beginning in 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture's Institute of National Resources (INRENA), under the aus- pices of Peru's National Fund for Natural Protected Areas of the State (PROFONANPE), held a series of meetings and workshops in Lima and San Martin (including both politicians and scientists) aimed at developing a plan for public use of the park (INRENA 1996). The meetings were accompanied by "fact-finding" expe- ditions to examine Gran Pajatén (Mendoza 1997). These activities culminated in two government-spon- sored studies conceived to analyze of all of the factors involved with creating responsible, sustained public access (i.e., tourism) to the park. These were contracted to the nongovernmental organizations ANDESTUDIO (to study the easternmost portion of the park; ANDESTUDIO 1997) and APECO (to study the westernmost portion). I participated in the latter study (APECO 1999) in which I Volume 16 • Number 4 1999 23</page><page sequence="9">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation advocate a landscape conservation approach (Church 1999). The Pajatén Predicament One might hope that Gran Pajatén's dual World Heritage status as a cultural and natural site, protected by both the Peruvian INC and INRENA, would ensure the site's integrity in the face of a wide variety of threats. However, the INC and Ministry of Agriculture have not communicated effectively with one another with regard to granting access to archaeological sites and development planning. The Ministry of Agriculture, in the form of INRENA with PROFONANPE, has taken the lead in terms of planning because it is simply better equipped to do so. This seems appropriate since Gran Pajatén has certainly benefited from the park's underdeveloped, but nominally pro- tective, infrastructure. Due to lack of governmental support, Peru's INC central office with its appointed staff of archaeologists has historically been unstable, and therefore unable to maintain long-term conservation ini- tiatives. However, neither INRENA nor the INC's San Martin office maintain staff archaeologists, and there is no clear legal mechanism to govern the quality of the cultural resource management so critical to the process underway. Finally, a latent threat exists in Peru's own Ministry of Industry and Tourism's 1997 mandate to generate revenue from the nation's cultural resource assets. Some conflicts that threaten site conservation in the Rio Abiseo Na- tional Park are more imagined than real, yet even false perceptions can inflict damage. Many people and in- stitutions see the problem of prohibited public access as residing in a small, selfish group of APECO and FPCN conservationists trying to prevent the public from enjoying its rightful access to the park. Actually, the founders of APECO foresaw the park's tourism potential (Leo and Ortiz 1982), and conservationists now struggle mostly to prevent the kinds of thoughtless atrocities committed by past expedi- tions. The event with greatest potential for negative impact was the 1997 relocation of the park's administrative headquarters from highland Pias, La Libertad, to Juanjuí, San Martin, at the behest of San Martin politicians. As a consequence of weakened vigilance at the western boundary, consulting scientists in 1998 encountered cattle grazing among the archaeological ruins at 2,650 m elevation, deep within the park (APECO 1999). San Martin and its regional INC office views itself as engaged in a struggle for control of the park with the INC's La Libertad office. The conflict is one manifestation of the wide political rift between these two departments which were to be ad- ministrativelyjoined in the early 1990s under Peru's "regionalization" plan - until San Martin reasserted its autonomy in a public referendum. 24 The George Wright FORUM</page><page sequence="10">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation Opponents of the plan argued that the administrative coupling made no sense given the lack of economic and transportation linkages. In this politi- cized context, Mendoza's (1994, 1997) repeated assertions that the ancient inhabitants of Gran Pajatén spoke the language of early historic lowland (San Martín) Cholón Indians seems to be a reaction to the perception of La Libertades historical domination of political, economic, and cultural affairs. Mendoza's assertion con- tradicts more popular interpretations of cloud forest occupations as colonization by highland Quechua- speakers (from La Libertad). The desire to lay claim to the site's ancestry, as well as to its present administration, reflects the intense feelings of national and regional pride connected with Gran Pajatén. Actually, the INC La Libertad office has traditionally administered projects in the Rio Abiseo National Park at the request of investigators because research projects are based at coastal universities in La Libertad and Lima. Most importantly, however, scientists are forced by geographic reality to enter the park from the western (La Libertad) side. From the coast it takes four travel-days by air, car, horseback, and foot, not counting days necessary for staging activities in Pataz or Pias. Construction of a road into the park is out of the question for reasons well-known to all but the most obdurate pro- development advocates. The upper Montecristo Valley's high altitude, capricious weather, lack of appropriate landing locations, and fragile ecology preclude systematic helicopter access. It remains to be seen how San Martin will administer conservation activities and regulate entry while being denied direct access to Gran Pajatén by im- mutable topography. From a technical standpoint, Gran Pajatén's predicament is even thornier. Pro-development factions, backed by the popular media, have perpetuated the idea that it is better to cut the vegetation off of the ruins rather than let it recover from its 1965-66 shear- ing. However, botanist Kenneth Young, who is familiar with the park, observes that the secondary regrowth is dominated by crowded stands of bamboo and light-demanding shrubs with voluminous root systems. These systems tend to penetrate and burst the masonry walls of archaeological structures. Presently, Gran Pajatén's primary constructions are in dire need of emergency stabilization. Subsequent maintenance may require that a resident caretaker cut the bamboo and shrubs constantly, allowing only the growth of strategic tree species that will restore the forest canopy. However, maintaining an individual and his or her family in such an isolated place for extended periods of time may not be practical for many reasons. Stra- tegically important sectors of the site must be covered with roofs that can withstand exposure to severe weather. Volume 16 • Number 4 1999 25</page><page sequence="11">Archaeology and the National Park Idea: Challenges for Management and Interpretation With a slate pavement and an elaborate covered drainage system, Gran Pajatén was built to shed water efficiently. The drainage system might be restored, but the site's slate covering is brittle, and the deterioration of passages and stair- ways is accelerating with the passage of visitors with heavy footgear. Further damage might be avoided by constructing alternative access or ele- vated walkways. Most troublesome of all, how will access and visitation to the sites be effectively controlled if vigilance is not based at the point of greatest threat to the park's resources (i.e., highland La Libertad)? The recently televised scientific recovery of Chachapoyas mummies from cliff tombs at nearby Lake of the Condors has stimulated great public interest in cloud forest antiquities. Fortunately, looters have so far overlooked many of the park's vulnerable antiquities that remain in situ . What has kept looters at bay, and what will most likely keep significant numbers of tourists away indefinitely, is the park's remote location. The question then remains: Who will provide the large sum of money required to deal with Gran Pajatén's urgent conservation needs given the complex political landscape and the unlikely probability of recovering the investment through a viable tourism concession? Without the immediate implementation of a cautious con- servation program, Gran Pajatén will suffer inevitable disintegration through a tragic combination of neglect and more of the same kinds of abuse that have characterized its recent history.
