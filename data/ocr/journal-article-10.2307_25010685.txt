<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEVEN LATTIMORE Oedipus and Teiresias The scene which is perhaps the most important in Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus begins with line 316. Urgently summoned and anxiously awaited, the prophet of Apollo-who sees the same things as the god (O.T. 284-285)-arrives at the royal palace of Thebes; less than 150 lines later Teiresias leaves, branded a traitor and charlatan by Oedipus and very doubtfully defended by the chorus. The intervening exchange is less illumined by prophecy than heated by the anger of both men, yet the remainder of the play takes the form of a relentless and comprehensive vindication of Teiresias' truthfulness. More than this, however, the Teiresias/ Oedipus scene reveals the resources and essential natures of the two men. Teiresias arrives late-at least, that is the opinion of Oedipus (289), who had already remarked on Creon's slowness to return from Delphi (73-75). While these lines could have been intended merely to convey Oedipus' desperate concern for Thebes (but hardly to characterize the impatience of a tyrannical nature), there is another possible significance. Creon and Teiresias will shortly be suspected of having plotted against him; the lateness of these two men, at this particular time of crisis, is not the least important piece of circumstantial evidence against them.' Here, by permitting Oedi pus' suspicions to appear the more plausible, Sophocles begins what strikes me as a programmatic attempt to justify his protagonist's thoughts and actions in the play.</page><page sequence="2">106 Steven Lattimore Teiresias' first words, 4ev, 4e)?, bpoveav s 8FeVv evOa lr TEXrq XVEt 4cpovoivrT may come as close as any to framing the "mes sage" of the play. They "strikingly refer to the awkwardness of his position,"2 but they could apply equally well, if in a slightly different sense, to Oedipus.3 That this double application was intended by Teiresias is suggested by the following dialogue, in which the prophet insistently links his own fate with Oedipus' (320-321, 324-325, 328-329, 332) until Oedipus expresses open anger. Teir esias does not deny Oedipus' intelligence,4 during the entire play this will be questioned only by Jocasta (quite wrongly, in 915-917) rather, he reveals the insufficiency of intelligence. Teiresias does not sustain his sympathy for Oedipus, or his assumption of sharing the human condition. Provoked into proph ecy, he counters Oedipus' accusation with a much more incredible one: Oedipus is not only the murderer he seeks, he has committed parricide and incest. The prophecy is rejected in its entirety by Oedipus, who concludes that Teiresias has no skill in prophecy. As a powerful and ironic device for informing the audience, the scene could hardly be improved on, yet-especially for those who regard Sophocles as a dramatic technician above all else-the cost may appear great; early in the play, Sophocles has "let the cat out of the bag,"5 and hereafter a hero particularly noted for his intellect must appear obtuse. Admittedly, while Teiresias says not a word which is untrue, he does not tell the whole truth,6 and the circumstances under which the prophecy is delivered are hardly conducive to belief, especially as mantic statements are intermingled with mali cious retorts.7 Defenses for Oedipus are not hard to find, but the very fact that the effort must be made creates a certain uneasiness about the function of the Teiresias scene. The question is less: "Why did Oedipus not understand Teiresias?" than: "Why is Teiresias made to tell Oedipus so much?" And the answer, I think, is that Sophocles meant to show that the question in the following action is not the individual intelligence of Oedipus but the efficacy of all human understanding. Ultimately limited to testing facts, judging the new by the old, arguing from probability, this faculty is not likely to cope successfully with fantastic coincidences, or to see through false but completely justified assumptions. The prophet of Apollo, when consulted, proves considerably more talkative than Apollo's priestess, but the amount of humanly usable information he conveys is not appreciably greater. Significantly, Teiresias only once captures Oedipus' attention</page><page sequence="3">Oedipus and Teiresias 107 after the two men have become angry. In full prophetic flight, Teiresias raises the question of the identity of Oedipus' parents (415 ff.). As it happens, this is a question that Oedipus has long wondered about, but he misses the reference; like the purloined letter, it is obscured because surrounded by other, unthinkable truths. But later, Teiresias, descending from seer to participant in a very human slanging match, indicates that he was acquainted with Oedipus' parents, and Oedipus naturally presses him for infor mation. In doing so, he at first picks up Teiresias' word yoveiwt with nroiwrL, then switches to the singular: ri 8&amp; u'iKwetl f3porCwv; (437). Like his ominous substitution of XAirro1 for the plural (124), this is not fully explained until later. Oedipus' doubts about his parentage-the doubts which started him on his route to unwitting fulfilment of the oracles-were prompted by a dinner companion who told him that he was a supposititious son to his father (780). So, at least Oedipus understood him, as iK41eL (437) indicates; Oedipus has no doubts that Merope is his mother until he is told that he is a foundling. This is another of the false assumptions which trap him. No enlightenment on this subject comes from Teiresias, who to Oedipus' exasperation-resumes his Delphic manner. After recapitulating his prophecies, with stress on the incestuous mar riage, Teiresias leaves. "Both men were angry, both made accusa tions which sounded incredible. One turns out to have had real understanding, the other not.... The truth cannot be gotten at through intelligence."8 The Teiresias scene makes this last point with extraordinary success. Oedipus is intelligent, perhaps su premely so, but he does not know, does not "see." Neither, however, does anyone else. "Sophocles' most daring exploitation of the gap between the false and true stories is the Teiresias scene,"9 but Sophocles cut the risk by preventing any other participant in the drama from surpassing Oedipus in reasoning power. The chorus hear all that Teiresias has to say10 but do not anticipate the king in discovering the truth, even after hearing the contents of the old oracles to Laios and Oedipus." Jocasta realizes Oedipus' true identity before he himself does; but she has always known that the baby was not killed outright, but given to a servant. The old retainer of Laios may seem quicker-witted than others, until one considers the extraordinary store of facts which he possesses from first-hand observation: he knows that a child of Laios and Jocasta was to be put to death-and why; he knows that it</page><page sequence="4">108 Steven Lattimore survived; he knows that Oedipus is the murderer. Throughout the play, mortals acquire knowledge only as a direct result of the positions they are placed in, and we are made to feel the unlikeli ness of Oedipus or of anyone else in his position (not: anyone of his character) thinking differently or "better." In this story logic and forethought are of no avail. This is perhaps a grim implication of Jocasta's statement that the god has no need of prophets, since what he wants disclosed he easily discloses by himself.12 Yet all the prophecies in the play are perfectly true. Clearly, Sophocles does not make Jocasta's distinction between Apollo and his intermediar ies. Any inadequacy in the transmission of truth occurs not between god and prophet, but between prophet and man.13 This returns us to Teiresias. If a consistent characterization of the prophet does not emerge,14 this is not because Teiresias is a dramatic device or a foil to Oedipus, but precisely because he is considerably more. Viewed on the human plane, he matches Oedipus in faults which have very often been regarded as &amp;auapria in the king: his temper is as quick, and as likely to lead him to forget his resolves; his pride in his status as Apollo's "slave" is fully as great as Oedipus' in his intellect, achievements, and position; he makes more unscrupulous use of his divine gifts than Oedipus does of his royal power.15 But the man who sees the same things as the god must be something more than a man. While Teiresias' open malice is authentically human, his almost perverse unhelpfulness (e.g., his refusal to exonerate Creon clearly in 379) seems authentically divine. I do not find it possible to make a consistent distinction between two voices of Teiresias, one human and one mantic or divine. Both voices belong to a complex being who stands ultimately on a level which is not human but daimonic.16 In his combination of omniscience and invulnerability (at least, complete confidence in his invulnerability), the prophet takes on some of the most important aspects of divinity. In the Oedipus Tyrannus, moreover, these are the only aspects of divinity which are in evidence (the indiscriminate loathing of pollution is shared by human beings). There is no indication of a divine order or dike which Oedipus has trespassed before becoming polluted,17 nor of a divine intent which manipu lates Oedipus for some higher purpose.18 The power of the gods here is simply Teiresias' adlreias cr-Ovos (369), and we are shown its limitations as well as its strength. It is as though the failure of Teiresias and the gods to give man a straight answer is actually an incapability. It is not that the gods will not help or inform Oedi</page><page sequence="5">Oedipus and Teiresias 109 pus-they cannot; their knowledge and very existence are too alien from his, and the extreme economy of expression which comes naturally to beings who know all is unintelligible to those who must learn, step by step.19 All too anthropomorphic in form and feelings (like Athena in the Ajax), Teiresias represents the gods of the Oedipus Tyrannus and dramatizes this alienation.0 In this play Sophocles' gods are real, powerful, and external. There is nothing to encourage man to expect help or justice from them.21 The play, however, does not end when the events foretold by the god have caught up with Oedipus. He now waits on the gods' further intentions, but these are left in uncertainty; more than ever, the emphasis is focused on Oedipus himself. The ruined Oedipus never blames folly or bad planning for his state, nor--except in the specific matter of his choosing blindness over death-do the chorus make any such reproach (and like Jocasta in 915-917 they are clearly wrong). Even the punctillious Creon is silent on this sub ject.22 But the most telling point is made in Oedipus' farewell words to his daughters (1511-1514). Nothing can make their life happy, as Oedipus has already made pathetically clear. If they had already reached the age of understanding, however, he (the fallen mon arch, polluted and hated by the gods) would have had much advice to give them-as it is, they can only pray to be granted a better life than their father's. Paradoxically, human intelligence-which could not save Oedipus and which cannot yet help his daughters-is held out as the most hopeful feature of the human condition. While the lesson is not for heroes alone but for all mortals, Oedipus' recog nition (or rather, continued understanding) of this is the high water-mark of his heroism.

Kamerbeek (supra n. 4) 111. "Contrast Trach. 820ff, in which the chorus anticipate Herakles in pronounc ing the truth of the oracles. In O.T. 1062ff, Oedipus, in failing to realize that his situation is much worse if he is a foundling, does actually lapse into illogic, but the poet prevents it from seeming his individual mistake; the king is preceded in this delusion by the old Corinthian, and the chorus share his exhilaration at learning himself to be a child of nrXf. 12I agree with the interpretation of lines 724-725 suggested by Kamerbeek (supra n. 4) 152. 13The ways in which the Teiresias scene reveals an antithesis between the omniscience possessed by the gods and the imperfect understanding of mortals have been analyzed thoroughly and perceptively by H. Drexler, "Die Teiresias-Szene des 'Konig Oedipus'," Maia 8 (1956) 3ff; cf. also H. Diller, Gttliches und menschliches Wissen bei Sophokes (Kiel 1950) for a discussion of the importance of this antithesis in Sophocles generally. Both scholars, however, strongly influenced by T. von Wilamowitz, Die dramatische Technik des SoIhokls (Berlin 1917), are too much inclined to accept Wilamowitz's dictum (82): "Denn fuir ihn [Sophocles] istja wirklich die Weisheit und Allmache des Gottes der eigentliche Sinn der Handlung." While infinitely preferable to the variegated attempts to define and prove Oedipus' guilt, this approach runs the danger of oversimplifying Sophocles' thought, and even his dramatic technique. It should not be thought that such a Sophoclean message, by avoiding moralizing, would avoid banality. In this drama-I would say, in all Sophoclean dramas extant-the poet had an end beyond the revelation of the gap between god and man; it might be truer to say that this was, for him, a starting point. "On contradictory elements in the characterization of Teiresias see K. Rein hardt, Sophokles (Frankfurt 1947) 114-115 and Kamerbeek (supra n. 2) 36-37. 1"A restrained and balanced evaluation of Oedipus as a great but flawed man-an approach which I feel is fundamentally wrong-is offered by V. Ehrenberg, Sophocles and Pericles (Oxford 1954) 166-174, with special emphasis on the tyrannical side of Oedipus' nature. Like many others, Ehrenberg places great stress on Creon's final words to Oedipus: rcivra /r&amp; tSoiAov KpCorre (1522) (those who consider Oedipus entirely innocent have cited this as evidence that his character does not-and should not-change). As I under stand this scene, Oedipus has never expected that his daughters will share his future existence, but, after he has briefly heard and touched them, separation brings forth his cry, not imperi ous but instinctive and irrational, Upriom ToravrW y' X7 purv (1522). Creon responds with rather characteristic overkill. SFor Ronnet (supra n. 10) 75 Teiresias is essentially human ("assez medio cre"): "I1 faut pour la conduite de Faction, car un devin qui parlerait avec la calme ma jeste de sa fonction mettrait Oedipe en presence de la verite et toute la piece serait changee." But it isjust such a capacity for dear speaking which seems withheld from the gods of the Oedipus Tyrannus; see infra. "See, e.g., H. D. F. Kitto, Greek Tragedy (New York 1961) 148-149 and A. Lesky, A History of Greek Literature (London 1966) 287. "8See T. Gould, "The Innocence of Oedipus: The Philosophers on Oedipus the King. Part III," Arion 5 (1966) 511 (in this article, the last of a very interesting series, the</page><page sequence="7">Oedipus and Teiresias 111 author allows the Oedipus at Colonus to intrude too often), cf. also A. Cameron, "The Maker and the Myth," Antioch Review 25 (1965) 178-179. "Kamerbeek (supra n. 2) 37, n. 2, takes strong exception to Drexler's inter pretation (supra n. 12) of the Teiresias scene as "nur dramatisch-technisch." Elsewhere, however, Kamerbeek (supra n. 4) 8 explains the purpose of the characterization of Teiresias as follows: Sophocles, aware of the difficulty of portraying divine omniscience and human ignorance simultaneously (cf. Drexler 10, 12, 20), presented Teiresias as sufficiently culpable in human terms that, while realizing that he speaks the truth, "the spectator ... will at the same time participate in the latter's [Oedipus'] delusion." I agree that this is a function of Teiresias' characterization but feel that it is not the chief one; see infra. 20If the Teiresias scene involves extreme difficulties for the dramatist (cf. supra n. 19), the real crux is not to make Oedipus' incomprehension believable (see supra), but to motivate Teiresias' inscrutability. 2"It is easier to believe that the gods are actively malevolent; recently, see Ronnet (supra n. 10) 192-198, who emphasizes that the oracles in the Oedipus Tyrannus directly influence the course of events. But-aside from the fact that the dinner companion (drunk but apparently not otherwise divinely inspired) plays a similar and crucial role-there are difficulties in this position. It seems true that Laios and Jocasta, then Oedipus, would have been better off without any or all of the oracles. These oracles, however, came from a fore knowledge for which no limits are indicated. If they were necessary for the events foretold to occur, then they were equally a part of what was foretold or "fated" and involve no special malevolence. On the other hand, if the events foretold could have been brought about in some other way, without (additional) oracles, it is not clear that the gods would have been less cruel in standing completely apart, or that Oedipus would have suffered less. In fact, Sophocles left the relationship between foretelling (which might be conditional even if no condition were expressed-it was a truism among the Greeks that oracles were often to be understood imaginatively rather than literally) and predestination somewhat ambiguous, at least in the minds of his characters. Oedipus, in his scepticism, does not conclude that his separation from Polybus and Merope-a separation which pained him greatly-was, after all, unnecessary. Similarly, Jocasta, rejecting all prophecy as false, does not complain that her child was killed for nothing. An oracle might be regarded as a valid warning but an invalid prediction. 22No greater contrast to Oedipus, in this respect, could be offered than the handling of Creon in Antigone (pace Ehrenberg [supra n. 15] esp. 73). From the moment Antigone calls him a fool, a merciless emphasis is placed on Creon's intellectual failings: his son lectures him on wisdom (685ff); the chorus, finally enlightened, reproach Creon for poor reasoning (1103-1104); Creon admits the fault (1265); and the motif of late learning closes the play.</page></plain_text>
