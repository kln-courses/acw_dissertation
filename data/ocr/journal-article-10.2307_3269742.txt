<plain_text><page sequence="1">SRUTI AND PHILOSOPHY BY IAN WATSON Hong Kong I It is sometimes said that the teachings of those Upanisads usually accepted as canonical shows development from a lower to a higher level of understanding, and that this development, which is said to be historical as well as doctrinal, is indicated by a movement within these scriptures from a less abstract to a more abstract mode of expression - from what is sometimes called a less philosophical to a more philosophical way of speaking. A typical example of this claim is found in a work by Bharatan Kumarappa: and in order to show how little reason there is to have faith in at least the major form-critical methods used by people who make these claims 1), as well as to throw some light upon the function of certain Upanisadic symbols used to refer to Brahman, I want to look at the suggestions of Sri Kumarappa. In doing so, I intend to argue, (i) that the historical development he speaks of cannot in fact be illustrated from the Upanisads, which, if anything, seem to suggest a quite contrary development; (ii) that the assumption of doctrinal development is based on two more basic assumptions which, once more, seem contrary to fact; (iii) that, if the Upanisads are sruti, a development through history from a less to a more adequate understanding of the doctrines these scriptures seek to teach is anyway impossible. II In his work, The Hindu Conception of the Deity 2), Sri Kumarappa claims to trace the pUanisadic doctrine of Brahman from (i) its sup- I) I am speaking here not only of claims made about Hindu Scriptures but of any scriptures whatever. And though I will in this article be speaking primarily of one group of Hindu scriptures-namely, the Upanisads-I believe that most of my arguments apply, mutatis mutandis, to other scriptures as well, Hindu or otherwise. 2) B. Kumarappa: The Hindu Conception of the Deity; London (Luzac), 1934.</page><page sequence="2">Sruti and philosophy 205 posed beginnings in the cosmogonic myth found in Brhadaranyaka 1:4:1-5, to (ii) the referring use of words like 'water', 'food' and 'breath' (prana), which normally are used to indicate natural phenom- ena, and then beyond to (iii) a still higher level, namely, the "level of abstract thought" 3), in which 'space' (dakaa) is used as a symbol for Brahman. In affirming this first supposed transition (from cosmogonic myth to the use of nature symbols), Sri Kumarappa begins with the claim that the Brhadaranyaka myth, which likely supplies us with the earliest symbols for Brahman found in the Upanisads, is no better than a "crude anthropomorphism" 4). From thence, he continues, "we rise to a distinctively higher level of philosophical thought" 4) when we progress "to explanations in terms of natural phenomena" 4) - viz., "explanations" in terms of 'water', 'food' and 'prana'. These explana- tions, he says, arose "precisely because these are absolutely essential to human life". 4) Now clearly, certain assumptions are at work here, most glaringly that the Upanisadic rsis were attempting to present some kind of "philosophical thought". That this is a false way to approach these (or any) scriptures will, I trust, be clear from examination of the more basic assumption underlying this approach - namely, the Western myth of 'progres'. By this I mean, the Western assumption that all movement forward in time amounts to advancement, coupled perhaps with, or even implied by, the Christian notion of 'progressive revelation'. It may be true, and shortly I will argue that in a way it is true, that "Whether the ultimately real is conceived of as Water, Food, or Breath, it is precisely because these are absolutely essential to human life". 5) But to view the relation between the creation myth and the use of nature symbols in referring to Brahman, as an historical movement from a "crude anthropomorphism" to a "higher level of philosophical thought" can be shown to be a viewpoint that has no grounds, both because there is no good reason to assume that the creation myth is in any sense "crude", or that the use of nature symbols represents a higher level of understanding. And even if there were good reasons, this would not of itself be sufficient to establish the supposed historical 3) B. Kumarappa; op cit; p. 6. 4) B. Kumarappa; op cit; p. 3. 5) B. Kumarappa; op cit; p. 5.</page><page sequence="3">206 Ian Watson development. I want now to examine some textual evidences in the hope of showing why I think this to be so. III B.rhaddranyaka expresses the myth of creation in words which remind one at once of the opening of the Book of Genesis, and of the first few verses of the Fourth Gospel. In the beginning this (world) was only the self (dtman), in the shape of a person. Looking around he saw nothing else than the shape of a person. He first said 'I am'. Therefore arose the name of I. Therefore, even to this day when one is addressed he says first 'This is I' and then speaks whatever other name he may have... He was afraid. Therefore one who is alone is afraid... He, verily, had no delight. Therefore he who is alone has no delight. He desired a second. He became as large as a man and a woman in close embrace. He caused that self to fall in two parts. From that arose husband and wife. Therefore, as Yajnavalkya used to say, this body is one half of oneself, like one of the two halves of a split pea. Therefore this space is filled by a wife. He became united with her. From that human beings were produced. 6) To this, Sri Kumarappa remarks, "Such crude anthropomorphism where the Prime Being is conceived of on the analogy of a man, and the method of creation is regarded on the analogy of animal reproduc- tion, stamps the theory as one of the oldest preserved for us in the Upanisads." 7) But to argue in this way seems to me as cogent as it would be to argue, of the Fourth gospel, that, because it uses the rela- tional implication "with God" (np6 r6yv Oe6v) of the Word (X6yo4), rather than simply stating outright that "the Word was God" (?s64 ?v 6 A6yoq), this Gospel must, therefore, be a "crude" and pioneer work. It is anyway surely false to imagine that no interpretation other than that this teaching is "crude" can be entertained; and the depth I would argue plainly to be here I will illustrate with a quite different suggested interpretation of two aspects of this teaching, two aspects chosen quite at random. Aspect (i): The first manifestation of the Supreme Being was to establish Himself as the referent of the reflexive pronoun: "Therefore arose the name of "I" (tato'ham namabhavat). Hence, the suggestion is that, whenever the reflexive pronoun is properly used - used, 6) Brhaddranyaka U paniSad, I :4: 1-4. The Principal UpaniSads; ed. Radha- krishnan; London (Allen &amp; Unwin); 1953. 7) B. Kumarappa; op cit; p. 4.</page><page sequence="4">Sruti and philosophy 207 that is, to indicate a person - the Supreme Being is its ultimate referent. Aspect (2): Whatever is predicated of the Supreme Being, is neces- sarily predicable of any being by whom the reflexive pronoun is properly used. His behaviour is the archetype of what would necessarily be the behaviour of any situation to which person-talk can be applied. "He was afraid. Therefore one who is alone is afraid." "He, verily, had no delight. Therefore he who is alone has no delight". Hence, the ultimate explanation of all rightful movement (dharma) of any situa- tion to which talk about persons applies, is that, in illo tempore, the Supreme Being so moved. Hence, to draw forth the central principle here expressed; since influence of the Supreme Being entails His presence (for nothing but the Supreme Being can move as He does), all personal movement is, ultimately, movement of this Being. I find nothing deserving the epithet "crude" in this. I am not of course suggesting the rsis to have had these interpretations in their minds in expressing themselves as they did; nor even that, had this way of construing their words been put to them, they would have understood the language employed. My suggestion is only that the scrip- tures are open to such interpretations as can clearly be seen to be of utmost complexity. In plain words: there can be no good reason to deny such 'depth' of the scriptures in question. IV Kumarappa has argued the next phase in the supposed historical development of Upanisadic "philosophical thought" to be "explanations in terms of natural phenomena", a movement into "the realm of the particular and the sensible". 8) First, anthropomorphism; then,, a crude form of superior materialism; thus does Kumarappa regard this development. So let us now look more closely at the textual evidence for this movement. B.rhadaranyaka Upanisad, agreed by most to be the oldest Upanisad, introduces the symbols in question - water, food and 'prana' -- in the following manner: There was nothing whatsoever here in the beginning. By death indeed was this covered, or by hunger, for hunger is indeed death. He created the mind, thinking 'let me have a self' (atman). Then he moved about, worshipping. From him, thus worshipping, water was produced. 'Verily', he thought, 'while I was worshipping, water appeared, therefore water is called arka (fire). 8) Kumarappa; op cit, p. 4.</page><page sequence="5">208 Ian Watson Water surely comes to one who thus knows the reason why water is called arka (fire) 9) Indeed, the first word of this Upanisad is the mystic sound, "AUM", likely the most elusive and profound symbol employed by the tradition in referring to Brahman. Chandogya likewise stresses the importance of this symbol, devoting much of the first chapter to its exposition. "OM", says Ranade, "is described unanimously in the Upanisads ... as not merely the supreme means of meditation, but the goal to be reached by the meditation itself. The Om occupies in Indian philosophy the same position which the Logos occupies in Christology". 10) But, without entering discussion of this beginning, and returning to the words I have quoted, the catalogue of names for Brahman as they appear in order could be listed as follows: (i) 'nothing' (naiveha) (ii) 'death' (mnrtyu), which is equated with 'hunger' (asandya) (iii) dtman, which is linked with 'mind' (manas) (iv) 'water' (apas), followed by other such concrete symbols, including 'speech' (vac; 1:2:4) and 'life-giving breath' (pratna; 1: 2:6). To this list might be added the symbol of 'food' (anna), about which I will speak further in a moment, as here by implication, since a necessary part of the meaning of the symbol 'hunger'. Throughout this early sec- tion of B.rhadaranyaka, Brahman is personified as he who eats whatever he creates - that is, as that from which all comes forth, and to which, in every sense, all returns. Now this list may be explained in the following way. 'Nothing' is here indicated to mean 'no-thing' or 'non-being' (mrtyu), in the sense of 'the non-manifest'; and this is equated with 'a craving for some lack' (asandyJ). This latter could be a symbol for "that which led the unmanifest to make manifest (create)", but I think it more likely to mean the form taken by the Unmanifest in the world, through which its self-revelation is affected. It would in this case mean, 'a craving for non-being (negation of ego-assertion)'; that is, indicate and explain the innate yearning for betterment, or that which Gabriel Marcel has well called - "ontological exigence". 11) "The world", 9) Brhaddranyaka; Radhakrishnan; op cit; I : 2: 1.

Marcel; The Mystery of Being; Vol. 2, ch. 3.</page><page sequence="6">Sruti and philosophy 209 says Maitri 6: 12, "was fashioned by Brahman with a desire for food". As might be expected, the next name to appear in the sequence is a general symbol in terms of which Brahman can be linked with the referent of individual (or, ego) - language - namely, the symbol of such universal-linkage application, dtman. 'Atman' is stressed as serving this function, as being a verbal device whose purpose in the teaching is, in part, to perform this universal-linkage operation, through being affirmed a possible name only when it is also possible to speak of 'manas' or 'individual mind'. That is, talk of 'atman' amounts, in some way, to talk of 'the inner man'. What precisely is this "way", the Upa- nisads will of course proceed to explain. Only now, having secured the possibility of talking about, by intro- ducing a language especially for, 'things manifest', are the specific symbols of 'water', 'fire', 'speech' and 'prJna' introduced. There seems to me, therefore, no scriptural sanction to affirm these latter as some kind of crude beginnings from which the earlier members of our list were supposed to have emerged; if anything, the latter, it would seem, were produced, in a manner most profound, from understood expression of the former, which, from the very beginning, were the deliverances of sruti. There are of course passages in which 'apas', 'anna' and 'prana' appear, on their own, as symbols for the First Principle, and source of all. 'Prana' appears in this guise throughout the scriptures (instance, Brhadaranyaka6: 1:7-12; Chdndogya 5:1:6-15; Prasna 2: 3: 4); whilst Brhadaranyaka 5:I remarks, "in the beginning this universe was just water. That water produced the true (satyam); Brahman is the true." And in Taittirlya we find, "From food, verily, are produced whatsoever creatures dwell on the earth. Moreover, by food alone they live. And then also into it they pass at the end. Food, verily, is the eldest born of beings... Verily, those who worship Brahman as food obtain all food." 12) But, there is, first of all, as little to suggest that B rhadaranyaka; 5: I is an early passage, removed to a later place in some later recension, as there is to suggest that Taittiriya is, in any sense, witness to an early shape of the teaching. In each case, the utterance belongs, if anywhere to a later rather than earlier place in the teaching. Secondly, if any 12) Taittiriya; 2: 2: I, Radhakrishnan; op cit: cf. Taittiriya 3: 6-3: Io; Maitr7 6: 11-12. NUMEN XIX 14</page><page sequence="7">210 Ian Watson commonplace symbols were sought to convey the teaching that Brahman is 'the source of absolute dependence', that is, 'the ground of all Being', none could be more natural than the three mentioned above. Such remains as true today as then, and whilst this may relate to the referent of these symbols being "absolutely essential to human life", it has no bearing whatever on any development in "philosophical thought". These concrete symbols are merely one set of counters (there are others) used to express the ever-recurring theme - that, to talk of 'Brahman' is to talk of 'that from which all comes, upon which all depends, and to which all returns'. And this theme, which sounds eternal, occurs, whether the symbols expressing it are these concrete ones, or the vaunted ones of "abstract thought". Since, therefore, the teaching they seek to impart is the same teaching in each case, there can be little reason to elevate one above the other, and hence little reason to regard one set as historically prior to the other. In each case, the message conveyed carries the same 'depth of soul'. V Finally, the claims made for a second transition - from the use of nature symbols to the use of space (aka'a) in referring to Brahman - seem to me no better. "When", remarks Kumarappa, "we pass to a comparatively universal and omnipresent element such as Space as the First Principle, we seem for the first time to pass to the level of abstract thought which has succeeded in dissociating itself from the sensible and the anthropomorphic". 13) But even the passage used to support this statement seems alien to its intent - Chandogya I: 9:I, which says, What is the goal of this world? He (the sage) replied, 'Space, for all these creatures are produced from space. They return back into space. For space is greater than these. Space is the final goal.' 14) And these words are strinkingly similar to those used of 'wind' or 'breath' (prdna) in Byrhadaranyaka. 15) "Food", says Buitenen, in a summary of certain Upanisadic doctrine, "is the atman's form, for the personal atman, which is prana, consists in food. Without it the sensory functions of the atman cannot operate; with it, they thrive. Of 13) Kumarappa; op cit; p. 6. 14) Chandogya; I :9: I; Radhakrishnan. 15) Instance Brhadaraniyaka; 6: I : 7-12.</page><page sequence="8">Sruti and philosophy 211 Brahman's two forms, non-time and time, the time form, too, is a completion of Brahman. This is the Year through which food grows and the creatures originate, live and return. Year is Prajapati who is Time - food is the nest of Brahman, its self." 16) In other words, 'anna' is but another symbol used to indicate the referent of talk about Brahman to be 'the Ultimate Explanation' or 'source of Absolute De- pendence' of all that is. All that exists is sustained by, takes shape, and exists solely because of, both 'anna' and 'prana' which persist through and are nourished by Time, and which are "the nest of Brahman, its self". And this differs in no important way from the manner in which the symbol of space (akada) is used in Chandogya. I find therefore no grounds to conclude these-the nature symbols and the symbol of akaia--to be other than two different ways of effecting the teaching, and of indicating the referent of person-talk to be-the ultimate source of absolute dependence. I see here no evidence whatever of a "first time" move to be vaunted "level of abstract thought". VI Much, then, of the form-critical method here employed seems based on the unquestioned acceptance of what I have termed-'the myth of progress'. The critical device of dating a piece of literature according to 'depth of soul' expressed in its theory rests squarely on two assump- tions: (a) that we, in the twentieth Christian century of the Western world, know what 'depth of soul' amounts to: (b) that the understanding of man is like a machine which develops at a uniform rate through history. Little evidence supports either assumption. Our world seems to many, peopled by fewer men of wisdom and good-will today, than in many a prior age. In commenting on the form-critical approach to the dating of Upani- sadic literature, R. D. Ranade's opinions well reflect my own. He advances five criteria upon which such criticism has proceeded, only one of which does he find of significant value. He speaks first of criticism based on language, style, grammar and vocabulary, which he argues to be virtually valueless. No a priori rule can be set for what style, manner of language, etc., any particular author or redactor must have used. Of the traditional criterion, endorsed by Deussen, that prose 16) J. A. B. Van Buitenen; The Maitrayaniya Upanisad; pp. 65-69. See also Taittiriya 2: 2: I; 3: 6-3: Io; Maitri 6: II-I2.</page><page sequence="9">212 Ian Watson works are old and works in verse, more recent, he remarks - "This is a gratuitious assumption which, in the light of modern criticism, does not seem to hold much water". 17) Thirdly, conclusions based on elaboration of detail within the documents, he also dismisses as of limited use; for once more, no a priori judgment can be established. The question of ideological development, the criterion against a par- ticular case of which we have argued, is likewise dismissed as of little substance. There is, for instance, absolutely no reason to believe that fundamental doctrine must appear later rather than sooner. Finally, the quoting of one Upanisad by another is,, he correctly notes, "the only test which may be regarded as being absolutely definite". 18) "But this test can have no universal significance, because we find only few definite interquotations among the Upanishads." 19) Hence, very little grounds exist for dogmatism in form-criticism of these, or of any, scriptures. VII.I But, the basic point here is the lack of justice done the logic of language sensibly employing terms about the Ultimate or Supreme Being; for if this logic is adequate, and the language successful (or correct in its claims), if, that is, the language is sensible, the doctrine conveyed by it is one incapable of development-it is sruti, "a divine afflatus springing from within, the result of inspiration through god- intoxication". 20) And if this is so, "the Vedas and the Upanisads must, like the basal literature of all other religions, be regarded as having been composed by seers in a state of god-intoxication." 21) Let us now look a little more closely at this claim. Firstly, though one cannot deny development through history of, for instance, the verbal garment of the teaching, this bears scarcely at all upon the nature of the body so clad. "For essences do not have a history. Essences do not change. Yet it is an observable and important fact that what have been called religions do, in history, change". 22) Even were 17) Ranada op cit; p. 14. 18) Ranade, op cit; p. 16 I9) Ranade, op cit; p. 16. 2o) Ranade; op cit; p. 9. 21) Ranade; op cit; p.Io. 22) W. C. Smith; The Meaning and End of Religion; Toronto; 1963; p. 130.</page><page sequence="10">Sruti and philosophy 213 it the case, as it seems not to be, that earlier Upanisads array themselves in fewer and simpler verbal-garments in talking of the Ultimate, little would thereby be shown about the message in the hearts of these early authors. What variation is to be found need be viewed as no more than a measure of the apparel thought to fit the teaching needs of any par- ticular moment. No assumptions about what was known to the rsis can be supported from the mere fact that different symbolic dress is used to transmit this knowledge. And if talk of 'the Ultimate' makes sense, then that which such language is about cannot change; and if this talk is understood, such understanding cannot possibly be improved upon, or subject to any 'development' whatsoever. At best, its language of expression can alter, adjusting to the shape of changing needs. If the earliest sages were Brahman-knowers and Brahman-sayers, nothing of substance would remain to be known-or said. VII.2 Yet this is not to repudiate philosophy. The work of the minds of men upon sruti can lead to more or less adequate thought systems based thereon; and it is perfectly proper to talk of "development" here. Though, whether any particular claims made about this supposed "development" are true (or not) is quite another matter. But such talk does highlight the danger of philosophy usurping the provenance of religion, of the human intellect assuming the authority proper only to revealed knowledge (sruti). Inevitably, the human mind finds the wis- dom of revelation fraught with puzzle; and inevitably, it seeks to resolve this by the drastic measure of excision-by cutting away what it does not understand. Let me illustrate the danger of such drastic measures with one example-the rise of Santkhya. It could, I think, be argued- though with what force I am not sure-that Sadkkhya began as a mis- interpretation of the Upanisadic doctrines of 'atman' and 'nmya', the former becoming the doctrine of 'multiple purusas', and the latter, that of Prakrti (as created nature), equal in metaphysical status to such 'purusas'. In Sadkkhya, "matter", says Deussen, "is as truly real as the soul, and therefore cannot be recognized by the latter as illusion, as in the Vedanta". 23) 23) Paul Deussen: The Philosophy of the Upanishads; Edinburgh; 1906; p. 254-</page><page sequence="11">214 Ian Watson Here, as so often elsewhere, when reason ousts revelation, the ten- dency to objectify takes charge. For with Saiikhya, it could be argued that two things have happened to Upanisadic tradition, both of which are an effort to think as objects the referents of two words, neither of which was meant to function in this way. It could, in the first place, be argued that, because 'persons' can be spoken of as if they were in- dividual things having observable boundaries, because, that is, the word 'person' has a plural sense, that to which 'atman' refers is, by Samikhya. thought of as, and hence reduced to, one among many individual ob- servable purusas (persons). Secondly, it is reasonable to suggest that, because the observable world of individual things (of objects having seeable, hearable, feelable (etc.) boundaries) can be spoken of as if it were real, and because 'maya' is a word which often appears to refer to this world, 24) this referent (the observable world of individual things), Samkkhya has concluded, has a ontic status equal to the above purusas. The chief (perhaps, only) difference between the objects we observe (i.e. the world of maya), and persons (purusas) is that the former alter, whereas the latter do not. Finally, because nothing can be thought of as real apart from persons and things, apart from purusas and the world of maya, apart, that is, from Purusa and Prakrti taken together, there can be no place for a further Deity. Assuming this interpretation, it is easy to see that Sathkhya, in, I am suggesting, its eagerness to make all things thinkable as objects, leaves out three fundamental elements of Upanisadic teaching, the tradition from which it comes: and it leaves them out, not because it has over- looked them, but because, having (on what grounds I cannot imagine) decided the workings of human reason must be superior to the workings of revelation, it is therefore convinced that much of the deliverances of revelation must be dismissed or cut-away because the intellect, or the human mind, cannot, of itself, accomodate them with at least some of its own deliverances. And the three abandoned elements of which I have spoken as fundamental to Upanisadic teaching are these: (i) That atman is a word used to refer to something about the fact that the Ultimate (Brahman) is linked in a special way with beings who can, on certain occasions, be thought of as things among other things; and that purusa is at least a word used to stress that these beings 24) I mean myad, as a synonym for Prakrti, used to refer to the created world, and not, as it sometimes does, to the power which creates the natural world.</page><page sequence="12">Sruti and philosophy 215 are subjects, not objects-that they are persons, not things. The some- thing about the above linkage-fact to which atman is meant to refer is that the subjectivity which these beings are is none other than Brahman. (ii) That speaking of Prakrti as 'real' is merely a manner of com- municating a lesser understanding of 'how things are'. (iii) That tad ekam ('that One') is a deliverance of revelation which includes yet goes beyond, both the subjectivity of atman, thought of as purusa, and the objectivity of maya, thought of as prakrti. If I am right, here, as so often elsewhere, discursive reasoning, by which I mean the human mind when left to itself, has entered merely to objectify utterances meant only to serve as myth; to make 'things' of supposed referents of notions which serve in the myth to voice some element of sruti. Here, as so often elsewhere, things of the mind have overcome those of the heart, in the passion manas so often shows for partial glimpses of the truth. "As part of the Veda, the Upanishads belong to sruti or revealed literature. They are immortal sanatana, timeless. Their truths are said to be breathed out by God or visioned by the seers. They are the utterances of sages who speak out of the fullness of their illumined experience." 25) In other words, the Upani- sads seek, not to convince the mind so much as to touch the heart, and are meant to awaken within the reader or pupil recognition of the Atman :Brahman equation, which is the heart of sruti. They do, indeed, lay no more claim to systematic philosophy than does the New Testament to organized Dogmatics. They, no more than any scripture, seek to satisfy the intellect with logics invented or uncovered by the minds of men. And that they do, so far as they do, satisfy the mind, is not because they are doing philosophy-never mind doing it successfully- but because, what they are doing, in so far as they are successful, satisfies the person as a whole. The Upanisads, in common with all religious scriptures, are an effort, not to make people better thinkers, but to make people better: and if we have understood that difference, then, I suspect, we have understood, or at least begun to understand, the difference between philosophy and religion. Perhaps being religious sometimes involves doing philosophy: it may even always involve this, though I doubt it. But certainly, one is no more the same as the other, than thinking well is the same as being well. 25) Radhakrishnan; The Principal Upanishads; p. 22.</page></plain_text>
