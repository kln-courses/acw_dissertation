Surveys of American urban history are less predictable than those in other fields of American history. Charles Glaab and Theodore Brown's A History of Urban America, the founding survey, initially relied on monograph stringing and was clearly aimed at a classroom market, but also sought to acquaint the profession with the then new field of urban history. Howard Chudacoff's The Evolution of American Urban Society, which concentrated on the lives of urban residents, and David Goldfield and Blaine Brownell's Urban America, which was more interested in city form and function, were also carefully structured chronological works intended for a classroom audience. But Sam Bass War- ner's brilliant Urban Wilderness, a highly personal, yet flawed tour de force moved well beyond the strictly urban, and was evidently meant more for his colleagues, policy makers, and that elusive "educated general reader."1 Eric Monkkonen's America Becomes Urban most closely resembles Warner's book, but it is unlikely to have as great an impact. According to Monkkonen, his book "falls between the comprehensive text- book and the more substantially focused scholarly monograph" (p. 2). Noting that the United States is "urban, but not urbane," he wants "to amend this partial rural self-understanding through a study that implicitly addresses the history of U.S. cities from a world historical context" (p. 1). The main refer- ence points, however, are the cities of western Europe and in making this comparison he builds on the "'old' and 'new' political and social urban his- tories" (pp. 1-2). In a strong plea for American exceptionalism, he argues that the "sprawling, diffuse, varied" American cities are quite different from their "historical, Old World, predecessors" (p. xiv). In short, American cities of today are "much closer in kind to those of a century ago [in America] than they are to virtually all the rest of cities in history" (p. 2). Monkkonen effectively uses urban history's abundant secondary literature Reviews in American History 20 (1992) 194-199 ? 1992 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">RABINOWITZ / The (Urban) World According to Monkkonen 195 and a rich mixture of primary material, including maps and photographs, to explore a variety of topics and individual cities. He is especially good at going beyond the standard large midwestern, eastern, and western cities-as he puts it, the skyline of New York, shoreline of Chicago, and bridges of San Francisco-to look at small cities and towns, most notably in the Midwest. Unfortunately, much of the material in the extensive but unwieldy notes would have been more effective if integrated into the text. For Monkkonen, the history of cities is "the history of how they came to their corporate status, what they have done with this status, and how they have shaped themselves" (p. xiv). Of critical importance to what at times emerges as an anthropomorphic city is "its legal status, which allowed it to act like a person" (p. xiii). It is never entirely clear how this fits with the claim that, "Our cities are what we have made them. They will be what we make them" (p. xiv). Nor is the "we" ever clearly defined. The reader is left won- dering about the implications for cities "shaping themselves." But a more serious problem with the book has to do with its intended audience, for it is unlikely to attract either the general reader or a student audience. In addition, much of the book is practically unreadable. This is sur- prising for Monkkonen at times provides arresting quotes and vivid exam- ples, and he can write sprightly and witty prose. The format, which switches from chronological to topical, also makes it unsuitable for use as a textbook. What we have is a disjointed series of essays, at best what Monkkonen calls "a sketch" (p. 8). Most of the chapters could have appeared in any order and within chapters there is a good deal of repetition and doubling back to issues seemingly already resolved. He has thus been all too true to his controversial 1986 article "The Dangers of Synthesis" and has produced a work in which the whole is less than the sum of the parts.2 Monkkonen makes sure there is no neatly wrapped synthetic package and that readers are conscious of the field's loose ends. To restate his own assessment, less generously, the book falls between the cracks; it is neither textbook nor monograph. Nevertheless, despite all the faults and self-indulgence, it is often fun to watch Monkkonen's iconoclastic mind at work, even when he is pursuing straw men or getting mired in the details of narrow studies about less than gripping places or topics. Among the arguments intended to stimulate de- bate: the railroads did not determine town hierarchies; crime was always less of a problem than people claimed; the "pervasive social control thesis" misses the point, as does the crisis model for urban problems; urban bosses were the exception rather than the rule and not as powerful as often alleged; state gov- ernments did not hold city governments hostage; and paved roads helped produce the automobile revolution rather than the other way around. There are also plenty of nice touches. Monkkonen skillfully uses Upton</page><page sequence="3">196 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / JUNE 1992 Sinclair's The Jungle to document the widespread ownership of property as an example of American exceptionalism and to argue that Jurgis Rudkiss's problem was not too much credit, as Sinclair claimed, but too little. In the same chapter, Monkkonen makes good use of his suburban roots and sub- sequent moves to illustrate the highly subjective and variable perception of housing quality. The activities of an imaginary mid-nineteenth-century Ohio farmer illuminates the basic tenets of central place theory. In other words, Monkkonen's book contains much of value-if only it weren't such a struggle to latch onto it. Much of Monkkonen's search for the "real" urban America, as compared to the more common emphasis on major cities, is carried on over the bodies of those whom he believes didn't get the story right. Indeed there are prob- ably more quotes from other scholars-the equivalent of television's talking heads-than there are from primary sources. According to him, three ap- proaches have failed to deliver the goods. The "humanist critique" of Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs, despite differences among its disciples, was "ahis- torical," preferring imagined to real cities. The tradition carried on by Richard Sennett, whom Monkkonen inaccurately describes as "a major historian," al- legedly carries the message "be different, be creative, be diverse, be just like us" (p. 19). Monkkonen is more pleased with the "statistical approach" epitomized by Adna F. Weber, Richard T. Ely, and Carroll D. Wright. Yet although he ap- proves of gathering information for reform purposes, he also finds this ap- proach to be "ahistorical." That leaves the New Urban History, an improve- ment over the old urban biography school, but in the end a mere flash in the pan. Rejecting his own academic roots in a narrow study of Columbus, Ohio, he observes that the New Urban History failed because it started out asking "Was it easier to get ahead in the past" and ended by asking "Where did all the people go?" Since "a little mobility goes a long way" (p. 28), and practi- tioners failed to make the methodology more subtle or pursue the implica- tions of their findings, the New Urban History was gone almost as quickly as it appeared. Given the problems with the three major schools, "urban history, like the city itself, has been left centerless" (p. 10). Still, Monkkonen finds some use in each, as he seeks to provide that center. Humanist critics can teach us to define the concept of the city broadly; the statisticians demonstrate the value of numerical overviews; and the New Urban Historians taught us to look for the impact of urban structures on individuals. One might argue that the over- looked "Richard Wade School" has at least come close to learning these les- sons, but as a Wade student it might be unbecoming of me to make that point. Monkkonen's key point is that "human action has been the principal force</page><page sequence="4">RABINOWITZ / The (Urban) World According to Monkkonen 197 in shaping our cities" (p. 3). And it is especially important for American cities that the major decisions concerning "structure and form" were made in the nineteenth century when the modern American city was "born" (p. 4). It was then, after a premodern era of continuity with Europe that stretched from 1790 to 1830, that the modern American city emerged as "service-oriented, debt financed, growth (and therefore capital) promoting, economic (not so- cial) center" (p. 4). The cities did not have to accept responsibility for the grow- ing problems with sewage, crime, unschooled children, or poor transporta- tion, but they did, and were able to do so because of their corporate status which permitted the regulatory, promotional and service providing city. They were also able to benefit from the protection of the "state" -the profession's new buzz concept for the 1990s. The era of the service-oriented city lasted from 1830 to 1930 and provides the book's focal point, both in terms of space and conceptual attention ac- corded it. This century-long period witnessed remarkable economic and pop- ulation growth that expanded city size and functions. Now the city was less response-oriented, as positive actions became the rule. The Depression how- ever, was a watershed, closing the era of city building and ushering in the era in which we now live. Previous innovations were institutionalized, as the new decentralized metropolis appeared, helped along by federal actions. Meanwhile, American cities reinforced their differences from Old World cities. Much of the difference flowed from the fact that American cities lacked the kind of expensive to maintain walls that characterized Old World cities going back to Damascus in 3000 BC. American cities also lacked an urban hierarchy dominated by a true primate city like London, Paris, or Mexico City. We've had instead a honey-combed distribution of urban places that nicely fits the hexagonal model of central place theory. Thus American cities are new, everchanging, and dynamic-they were, to borrow Louis Hartz's fa- mous statement of American exceptionalism, "born free." Monkkonen reaches his conclusions by a different and at times tortuous path, but the news is not exactly a revelation for American historians. Yet the "unbounded city," ironically produced the "tyranny of the center" (p. 58) -whether because of its strength or weakness-also found in European cities. Monkkonen's chapter on "Transportation: From Animal to Automobile" typifies his approach. In another of the frequent restatements of his basic theme, he notes that "the central argument of this book is that our under- standing of U.S. cities must consider two histories simultaneously: the history of outside factors that shaped the growth of cities, and the history of their own self-determination" (p. 166). Thus he challenges Sam Bass Warner, urban geographers, and other practitioners of "technological determinism." War- ner's Urban Wilderness, for example, is accused of arguing that changes in</page><page sequence="5">198 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / JUNE 1992 technology caused changes in urban growth. Monkkonen then quite smartly destroys this argument. The trouble is that Warner makes no such argument and in fact throughout his book argues that decisions have and can be made to control such forces. In a survey of this type it is not surprising to find other sins of omission or commission. It is simply not true that urban dwellers were five percent or less in every region between 1790 and 1830. General incorporation laws were a product of the Jacksonian Era rather than the late nineteenth century. The British and the antifederalists would be shocked to learn that American cities did not become active in national political affairs until well into the nineteenth century. And the rural-urban communities of colonial New England and the Spanish Southwest were anything but "unplanned" as Monkkonen implicitly claims. Perhaps most disappointing is the brief section in the concluding chapter on the Sunbelt, in which the iconoclast surprisingly does not go be- yond the myths of the subject; indeed, Monkkonen seems to confuse the Sunbelt with the urban South. Monkkonen returns to form, however, in his epilogue, "How Do We 'Watch' Our Cities," which contains an interesting discussion of history and vision. He correctly challenges those who too often view our cities in terms of problems, rather than their remarkable achievements. Resurrecting Fred- erick Howe, he endorses the turn-of-the-century urban reformer's point about there being nonurban causes for problems requiring urban solutions. And in his most optimistic section, he argues that problems are less serious today than in earlier years. This point, of course, has been made by others, especially by Richard Wade, whom he does not mention. But he ignores, as Wade does not, the potentially crippling power of race and suburbanization, which threaten to tear the metropolis apart. Only at the very end does he raise the issue of metropolitan fragmentation and then only to view it as hav- ing potential for variety, fearing more the creation of wealthy enclaves than the lack of coordination among small governmental units. Where others see the edges of cities as having the potential for disaster he sees them as grounds for hope. Monkkonen can be so optimistic because of his refreshing faith in the power of "human action, human institutions, human organizations" (p. 239) to deal with urban problems. Even the tension between demands for lower taxes and increased services can be resolved. What we have going for us is that our cities are young, and open to knowledge. At the same time, however, this youth also means that our services and schools, police, public health officers, etc. are quite fragile-having been the product of conscious decisions, they could as easily deteriorate and go away. History then can help us to rethink our cities. But Monkkonen gets too</page><page sequence="6">RABINOWITZ / The (Urban) World According to Monkkonen 199 mechanical here -knowledge could very well produce certain "proper" ac- tions, but then again this has not always been true in the past. Monkkonen is himself surprised by his own optimism, which he contrasts with other ur- ban historians. It would be nice if he is right about the promise of the "adap- tive and potentially humane city" (p. 244), but to make a strong case requires more attention to the critical years since 1930 and their unprecedented prob- lems, the depths of which he never truly plumbs.
