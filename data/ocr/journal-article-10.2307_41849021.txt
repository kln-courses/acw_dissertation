<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIANE VERNON 1 BAKUU: POSSESSING SPIRITS OF WITCHCRAFT ON THE TAPANAHONY This paper (1) is a report on one pantheon of possessing spirits known as Bakuu (2), which was in full expansion among the Djuka of Tabiki on the Tapanahony river, Suriname, in the period when I visited them between December 1976 and February 1978 (3). While even my oldest informants denied ever having seen Bakuu me- diums in that village before (and I was unable to find any Bakuu spirit that had possessed a medium longer than 3 years) the Bakuu phenomenon was then being experienced as visions in the night, as interpretation of illness and death, as witch accusation, and as spirit possession. One example of Bakuu social drama is recounted below, and an attempt is made to situate the Bakuu in relation to other pantheons of possessing spirits. All generalizations attempted here should be understood to be premature, and to apply only to one village, observed at a moment when it was mo- bilized by what it considered its first case of Bakuu possession and accusation. The Djuka The Djuka are one of six tribes of Bush Negroes whose territorial homes are river-side villages in the rain forest of Suriname and French Guyana (4). These tribes originally formed in the 17th and 18th century as African slaves escaping from the coastal planta- tions grouped together in the sanctuary of the bush. The fugitive bands worked out a subsistence economy in the forest based on hunting, fishing and slash-and-burn agriculture, while they con- tinued to acquire tools, arms, and new recruits by making periodic raids on the plantations. They were in turn pursued by colonial mi- litia which they fought off with guerrilla tactics until in 1760, the first peace treaty was concluded with the Djuka, granting them the semi-autonomy which they still retain today. Among the promises made in the treaty was a regular tribute of coastal goods to be deliv- ered to the village chiefs (Benoit, 1839). Today, this has been commuted into small salaries paid out to Djuka village officials, the lantiman.</page><page sequence="2">2 DIANE VERNON The abolition of slavery in 1863 opened new opportunities for the Bush Negroes to obtain wealth and coastal goods, first through lumbering, then from around 1880 until the 1920's, by their par- ticipation in the gold rush. Overnight, Bush Negroes from all tribes were able to cash in on their knowledge of difficult river navigation and canoe construction to become the highly-paid specialists of inland transport for the fortune-seekers of gold and balata (DE Beet &amp; Thoden van Velzen, 1977). It was a period of intensive con- tact between the Bush Negroes of different tribes and the bakaa (whites and Creoles), and it seems to have ushered in a new era of cultural exchanges between Afro-Surinamers which up-dated the common cultural heritage they owed to an early plantation synthe- sis (see Price, 1973 a). It is in this period, say the Djuka, that Ba- kuu first made their appearance on the Tapanahony. After 1920 gold production dwindled, the demand for boatmen declined, and a time of handed-down remnants of hammocks and re-filled cartridges set in, until from the 195 O's on, and increasing- ly so, male migrant labor became the obvious solution to Bush Negro consumer needs. Bakuu throughout Suriname A comparison of the literature compiled today by students of the various Afro-Surinamese groups reveals a remarkable similarity in the belief systems of Bush Negroes and Creoles alike. As Richard Price (1973) writes, referring to the Para and the Bush Negroes, 'Given the relative isolation of these peoples from one another for more than 200 years... one can only conclude that a new, Afro- American religious system was forged on the plantations during the ... earliest decades of the colony's history...' Among those spirits now commonly known to all Afro-Surinamers (5) is the Bakuu , or Bakru. Wooding(1972 b), who classified the Para version of this spirit among their bush gods, traces its parentage to the Ivory Coast, Central Ghana, and Togo. There, under the name of Biakuru , Bur- ka , or Buku , the African forerunners of the Surinamese Bakuu were known as lower deities of an evil nature, but capable of confering wealth. Herskovitz (1936), on the other hand, relates the Bakuu to the Dahomean Abiku - spirits which are born as hu-</page><page sequence="3">BAKUU 3 man children but die young. Other particularities, such as the Fon belief that the soul of a deceased may be stolen and manipulated for purposes of witchcraft (Ola Balogun, personal communication) - accrete to build up a patchwork spiritual entity: a tool for ambi- tion, greed, vengeance, and murder that unites ideas of riches and death behind the guileless appearance of childhood. Like other spirits, the Bakuu varies from tribe to tribe - and probably over time - as to what brings it, who is vulnerable to its attacks, and what is to be done about it. But Djuka, Paramaka (LENOIR, 1973) and Matawai (DE Beet, personal communication) all agree that it is not native to their cultures but an imported evil, manufactured on the coast by Creoles or Chinese (6). Among the Djuka, it is said to have appeared relatively late in their history, first brought to the river by bakaa who carried them in their luggage to guard their gold. Thoden van Velzen (1978: 108-109), in transcribing the Djuka massive exorcist wave that became known as 'Ma Cobi puu sani' (Mother Coba removes things evil) circa 1890, noticed that Bakuu were conspicuously absent from that list of eradicated evils. His informants could not remember any Bakuu being exorcized then, and some added that such spirits came only later - during the heyday of the gold rush, or in the time of balata bleeding (1920s) (T.v.V. pers. comm.). While Thoden van Velzen remarks that the latter date is the less probable since VAN Lier, a balata bleeder himself, does not mention hearing of such a connec- tion, the same relation between Bakuu and fortune hunters of both gold and balata is confirmed by the Para Negroes, who told WOODING (1972 b), 'In former days, the gold diggers and balata bleeders were the main ones to make use of bakrus' It is possible, then that Bakuu belief was not part of the original cosmology elaborated on the plantations but that it evolved on the coast after the escapes and was not imparted to the maroon societies until the feverish years of rainforest fortune hunting. Tabikans point to the village of Malobi as being the first, or at least the foremost, to have had Bakuu mediums. All of these early Bakuu are remembered as avenging spirits (kunu) sent usually by bakaa in retaliation for a theft. One such story from the 1920s is recounted by an old Tabikan boatman who had indirectly been in- volved.</page><page sequence="4">4 DIANE VERNON A Creole lady from Martinique whose name was Medaille entrusted to a Malobi boatman a large sum of gold. The boatman faked an accident in the rapids around Tapudam and ab- sconded with the fortune. Suspecting a hoax, the woman tried several times, but to no avail, to persuade the culprit to return at least part of the treasure. Finally, she fixed up a Bakuu which she sent to reap revenge. In Malobi people sickened and died until the day when the cause was discovered. The present headman of Malobi, kabiten Bonte, went to the lady and pleaded with her, promising that they would try to repay her part of the gold in trade, but she replied that with the best will in the world it was now too late - the Bakuu was already in the (Malobi) family. The Bakuu , as it appears to the Djuka of Tabiki when it startles them from sleep in the night, ressembles a doll (7) or a lightcolored Creole child dressed in city clothes (8). In truth, it is neither child nor doll nor deity, but the shade of some unknown (and probably evil) dead, which had been captured and tinkered with by a Creole or Chinese magician, and made to inhabit a mannekin. The little body is composed half of flesh, half of wood, its wooden half serving the Bakuu as a shield to foil its assailants. While the Djuka claim not to know the art by which such magi- cians enslave the ghost of a deceased, Herskovits (1936) offers a coastal description of how it is trapped in the hair and fingers of the corpse. Such a technique fits easily into Djuka supernatural sche- mes, for it ressembles a perversion of one act of traditional Djuka burial rites - abandoned since 1972 - of using the corpse, or its hair and finger nails, as a temporary oracle for interrogating the ghost of the deceased, which hovered over its remains. Like the Haitian 'engagement' (Metraux, 1977), the Bakuu is a spirit pet which the bakaa (Whites, Creoles, or Chinese) may keep to make and guard their money. Tabikans do not seem to see them- selves as buying it for this purpose. They prefer to seek the assistan- ce of the traditional Djuka spirit that helps men to acquire progeny and fortune, the Papa (9). With the Bakuu there is always a risk that it will turn on its owner, from its role of gift-giver to its role of killer. For, according to the information I have, it is only in its role of killer that the Bakuu appears among the Djuka. Although all spirits have some power over life and death, and although any but K untan- ti may come to sicken and kill, only the Bakuu comes exclusively as an enemy. It carries a stick to knock down its victims, and its attack is usually sudden and violent, and often aimed at the head. Migrai-</page><page sequence="5">BAKUU 5 Fig. 1. Sketch map of northwestern Suriname, indicating the situation of Tabiki and neigh- bouring villages.</page><page sequence="6">6 DIANE VERNON nes, nervous disorders, even toothache, and as VAN Lier (1944) noted, insanity, all proved in 1976-78 to be attributable - at least in an appropriate moment of brewing accusations - to the Bakuu (10). But neither in theory nor in practice are these complaints automatically diagnosed as a Bakuu attack, nor are they the only ills of which he is capable. They tended to be the chief complaints of the women who shortly became Bakuu mediums, or of the Bakuu 's contemporary surviving victims. (Whether or not the posthumous- ly diagnosed Bakuu attacks that had killed past victims also took into account this specialization in illness, I cannot say. I was rarely able to disinter their symptoms). What brings on a Bakuu attack? There are certain indications that the 'cause' of a Bakuu attack may have undergone a funda- mental change of definition from the introductory period of aveng- ing Bakuu guardians in the service of bakaa hunting for gold, to the present bewitching Bakuu in the service of evil Djuka out to kill close relatives. Unfortunately, I have no information as to whether or not Bakuu were bought by Djuka for witchcraft during the first period. And I am told (Thoden VAN Velzen, pers. comm.) that in the villages of Malobi, Vandaki, and Tsjontsjon, Bakuu still appear as avenging spirits today. In Tabiki, the correlation between social + spirit changes appears more clear-cut: while I could obtain no satisfactory accounts of Tabiki Bakuu and their mediums from the first period, it was said they had come - as kunu (avenging spirits) - but that they came no more. The Bakuu witchcraft epoch is cited as making its debut 'about 20 years ago'. This corresponds roughly with the new era which Thoden VAN Velzen (1977) termed the 'opening up of the interior', characterized by renewed traffic on the rivers and massive immigration of Djuka workers to the coastal city. Tabikans say (but I have no statistics to verify this) that it is only within the past twenty years that the flow of villagers to the coast has begun to make itself felt so that certain ceremonies must be abridged, and the Djuka social calendar synchronized with bi-annual coastal holidays. It is within the latter half of this decade, a few years after the retirement of the Gaan Gadu witch-cleansing oracle (Thoden van Velzen &amp; van Wetering, 1975) that me- diumship to Bakuu spirits of witchcraft began in Tabiki.</page><page sequence="7">BAKUU 7 Social organization in Tabiki The Djuka, like other Bush Negroes, are a tribal people, with at their head a Paramount Chief, the Gaanman. The tribe is composed of clans called lo , and the village of Tabiki is synonomous with one clan known as Pedi. Within the framework of the clan, the matrilin- ear descendents of individual ancestors form the most relevant so- cial group in Djuka society: the bee - the corporate matrilineage. The Pedi clan unites four such lineages, said to have escaped sepa- rately from different plantations, and joined together in the forest. Two of these bee - Amanta and Dona - are very small (approxi- mately 60 and 40 adults respectively), and for several months in the year, when labor migration and bush camp farming drain away almost all their members, they are closed quarters. The two larger lineages called Pedi (approximately 110 adults), and Kaysina (ap- proximately 200 adults) are never so completely depopulated. In Tabiki, the bee (even when as large as Kaysina or as geograph- ically segmented as Pedi) seems still to be respected as the largest exogamic unit. Since the preferential marriage partner is the classi- ficai ory cross cousin, and since individuals are more comfortable marrying within the village (KÖBBEN, 1967), members of the Pedi clan were usually either lineage mates or affines. Lineage members hold in common the rights to certain secular status positions (see below). They are also supposed, collectively, to hold the patents to particular gods, to avenging spirits ( kunu ), cer- tain spirits that had formerly possessed a lineage member, as well as appropriate certain paraphenalia such as shrines and carry-oracles. Major deities, like the god Gedeonsu which is under the tutelage of the Kaysina lineage, 'good' spirits such as an old line oiKumanti , and even very ambivalent spirits such as those sent to bewitch, all are either intentionally passed on or may be spontaneously revived in new episodes in succeeding generations of the bee. In a large lineage such as Kaysina, informal divisions occur. Seg- ments of the lineage sort out distinct village quarters and are identi- fied in common parlance as 'the people of...' its most prestigious contemporary member. Within these smaller divisions, goods, ser- vices and visits are exchanged, and certain spirits may be more rele- vant to this unit. This is the first working arena for small-time and novice spirit-mediums and the place from which they draw audien-</page><page sequence="8">8 DIANE VERNON ce and clientele. Significantly, it is also the imagined target area for witches, who may also employ spirits, but in secret, instead of pu- blicly and to kill instead of cure. The autonomy of the segment in witch accusations is clearly visible in the Bakuu case described be- low: segments of two different lineages collaborated in the charges from 1976 to 1978, while the remainder of each lineage stayed aloof until 1979. Further divisions may occur within the segment itself. Those members of the quarter who spend from several months to most of the year away from the village in neighboring bush camp residen- ces seem to intensify relationships among themselves, and back in the village quarter, they may show signs of functioning as an inde- pendent group. One of these signs I take to be in-group elaboration of witch accusations such as the one below. The Bakuu witch scare appears to have had its origins in just such a product of intensified relations of one part of a segment before being taken up by larger units. Lanti - Government 'When God made the earth, He retired from it. When He retired, to whom did he leave it? To lantV (from a speech by Da Balawan). Lanti, as a noun, means 'government', or as a verb, means formally to present a case to a third party. All problems of men - marriage proposals, mortuary ceremonies, breaches of conduct, and even the affairs of men and spirits - are dealt with in palavers with lanti- man (elders and titled specialists) at appropriate levels of social or- ganization (Köbben, 1966). The most official part of village government consists of titles rec- ognized and remunerated by the national government of Suriname. These are secular offices, though they may be awarded to an impor- tant religious leader. In Tabiki, clan head and village headman ( kabiten ) was Da (father) Akaapa, of Pedi lineage (segment II). Appointed by him were two sub -kabiten, one from the other half of the Pedi lineage, the other from tiny Dona bee. Secondary positions of basia were awarded to one man from each lineage, with, again, two in the Pedi bee (11). Although these positions are passed on within lineages, and even within particular segments which guard them jealously, they ob-</page><page sequence="9">BAKUU 9 Fig. 2. Sketch map of the village of Tabiki.</page><page sequence="10">10 DIANE VERNON viously fail to reflect the social structure or the numerical impor- tance of the groups. They represent on the one hand favors which offer status and a small salary, on the other, the obligation and power to perform roles in government. These are government spe- cialists who operate within the village, but may be invited to exer- cise, as do religious specialists (12) even beyond the boundaries of village and clan. Lanti and witch accusations From the trials and burnings of witches in the preceeding cen- tury (DE Groot, 1969), witch accusations have been increasingly relegated to the margins of the village judiciary. To conform to pressures from the national government of Suriname, in keeping down violence in the villages, treatment of suspects has perforce be- come steadily more humane: lynchings are acts of outlaw justice, and beatings - while still considered a justified course of action to take against a witch - are discouraged by the lanti. Yet suspicions, aided by illness and ill luck, build up little by lit- tle say the Djuka; they are brought sharply into focus through vi- sions and dreams, until, finally, the heinous act of witchcraft may even be confirmed by the spontaneous revelations of a spirit me- dium. The potentially most explosive form of revelation is the ac- tual possession (in trance) of the witch's victim by the very spirit sent to kill him. The spirit itself then admits to its deeds and calls out the name of the witch it has been working for. Although once a spirit gives itself up the danger to its former victims is largely past, such revelations obviously will not be received calmly by the family of the victim, who may have been sick for years. It becomes neces- sary, in the interests of peace, to censor the new oracle so that is does not broadcast the witch's identity: the name is from then on withheld to protect the 'guilty'. This censorship is usually first imposed by the basi who either exorcises the spirit and replaces it by a good one, or 'washes' away its evil parts and tailors its better half to permanent mediumship. When the new possessing spirit (winti) later appears before the as- sembled lanti to be officially heard and accepted as a member of the community, it may once again be reminded, this time by the lanti, not to call names.</page><page sequence="11">BAKUU 1 1 How obedient is a spirit to the commands of mortals? Theologi- cally speaking, the orders of a lantiman are backed up in the celes- tial realm by the great ancestors, while those of a basi are usually spoken in the name of a powerful spirit to which he is medium. By the fact of its possessing through trance, a spirit is demonstrating that it desires the privileges that come of social intercourse with men, and is prepared to respect their laws. The spirit's reputation is then built up over the years to the greater status of its medium. The unspoken penalty for anti-social behavior on the part of a winti is probably exorcism, re-identification, or exposure of the medium as a fraud. Furthermore, mediums act as appendages to secular govern- ment. Through their spirits they proffer oracular pronouncements which interpret events and advise on a proper course of action. And as both Price (1975) and Köbben (1967) remarked, these pro- nouncements are not purely personal inspirations on the part of the medium: he is rather the mouth-piece through which some part of public opinion speaks. The medium is not only interpreter of his group's opinion, he must also take into account the sometimes con- flicting views of other groups - particularly those which hold sig- nificant secular or religious power. A tame spirit is thus cast in the role of a powerful, sometimes ca- pricious fellow villager, but who has a respect for authority and cus- tom. The reasonable man concept of GluckmAN (1963), which KÖBBEN (1966) found applicable to Djuka mortals is equally true of their possessing spirits, which labor under an unspoken threat of being discovered if their behavior does not conform to what might be expected of a 'reasonable spirit'. It sometimes happens as it does in the case below, that no censor- ship is imposed on the revelations of a bewitching spirit, either by the basi or by the lanti, and the winti is allowed to reveal the name of the guilty before all the village. This leaves the way open to sanc- tions being taken against the scapegoat without their being speci- fied by the lanti as punishment: a beating may take place, which will be condemned: the affinal lineage may decide, if the culprit is a man, to break up the marriage; and of course, ostracism in all its forms - refusal to help, to share, avoidance of social and sexual in- tercourse.</page><page sequence="12">12 DIANE VERNON If the accused is convinced of his own innoncence, what recourse does he have? This is the question which the scapegoat of the story finally asks, and, in his case, the answer given him is 'none'. Djuka judiciary protocol is such that a defendent does not plead his own case. His defense is handled for him by his kin - either selected by him, or who have themselves voluntarily come forward - and these spokesmen will plead what they feel to be appropriate, given popular opinion, the relationships of the protagonists, and political pressures (KÖBBEN, 1966). Obviously, then, the defense the ac- cused wishes to present must be one which his kin feel they can plead. But in the following case, it is these same kin who feel them- selves to have been his victims - first members of his matri-seg- ment, then the affinal group (segment), and finally people even from his father's matri-segment (which was also the other half of his affinal lineage). His kin, have, in a sense, already presented his case - through the possessing spirit of the Bakuu which admitted his guilt for him. At last, there is only one person who dares come before the lanti on behalf of the accused, and that is the accused himself. He re- quests an appeal to a higher instance, to the court of the Paramount Chief. But the system is not devised to work in such a way. A de- fendent cannot take himself to court, only his accusers can do that. The advice given him is to wait. A man who feels he has not re- ceived his full measure of justice will normally bide his time and wait for future events to play into his hands (KÖBBEN, 1966), allowing him to ripost. But, in the case of someone unjustly accus- ed by a spirit of practising witchcraft, it seems that he can only hope for some new oracular revelation that casts suspicions on the older one, and that opens the road to a reinterpretation in his favor. If this does not happen during his lifetime, his ghost, become ances- tor, may see to it after his death, by returning as kunu (avenging spirit) interpreted by a new spirit medium. When does it happen that the stops are pulled and an accusation submitted by ecstatic witnesses heard? A year after the Bakuu drama, people from the lineage of the accused (though from differ- ent segments) commented that such 'preferential' treatment was out of order, and that 'they' had been wrong in allowing the hear-</page><page sequence="13">BAKUU 13 ing. Who is 'they'? While the basi who socializes the Bakuu winti (possessing spirit) is the first to censor it, it is the lanti, and particu- larly the headman who has the final say. Leaving aside for a mo- ment the question of private politics, which no doubt also played a part, the accusation seems to have served an important social func- tion as an oracular accounting for past tragedies, while at the same time, acting as a return of justice for a man who had himself been a particularly vicious witchbater. Cosmology and the place of the bakuu Below the aloof apical God who created the earth and left it to the lanti, sit the heavenly lanti - the Gaan Yooka (great ancestors). They take an eternal interest in the lives of their descendants, both protecting and punishing them. These spirits of the greater and les- ser dead, avenging or blessing, all make up one pantheon of posses- sing spirits - the Yooka. Beneath the Gaan Yooka the cosmos teems with deities jostling for position. They are classified by the Djuka in two ways: 1) Geographically Spirits of the sky (tapu gadu)' of the water ( wataa gadu)' of the bush {busi gadu)' and the latest - 'city thing' (foto sani), or the Bakuu. 2) By Pantheons All the spirits classified under the above headings are reshuffled and arrayed in pantheons of winti (possessing spirits). This classification has a direct bearing on the process of domestica- tion of a new possessing spirit, and spirits which do not technically belong to any of these, (i.e. Busunki, Njamasu) will be assimilated to one in the interests of socialization. In Tabiki, five pantheons were functioning: Kumanti: an ecstatic warrior cum doctor cult of benevolent spirits originally brought from Africa by the ancestors. (In Tabiki, 24 people were mediums to Kumanti spirits). Papa: 'Twelve' (sic) different types of spirits - of animals and plants from forest and river - are said to belong to this pantheon. (In Tabiki, 24 mediums). Like the Kumanti , a Papa spirit may appear out of love for a person. But unlike Kumanti , it may also come as a toobi gadu (affecting only one person), or as kunu (affecting a matri- group) to avenge a plant or animal that someone has harmed. Both Kumanti and Papa pantheons use high theatricality - employing sacred language, dances and songs, and requiring training of several months for both medium and spirit to become adept. The entertainment these spirits provide is taken as added proof of their friendliness. The three remaining pantheons require no training for mediumship, and are not expected to offer formal artistic displays - a sign of their more ambivalent nature.</page><page sequence="14">14 DIANE VERNON Yooka ů. 'the cold people' - this heading, discussed earlier, regroups all the dead. Together with the Bakuu , it is the only pantheon which may contain 'foreign' elements (i.e. the ghosts of non-Djuka, or even non Bush Negroes). (I found 14 Yooka permanently attached to Tabiki mediums, with three others of impermanent status). Ampuku : A clever anthropomorphic bush spirit, it is said to ressemble a human being - tall of stature and black of skin. A great imitator, the Ampuku can pass itself off as another spirit. It may possess (usually a man) out of friendship, or avenge as a kunu , or it may be hired to bewitch. (In Tabiki, I found only one man who was medium to an Ampuku , that in partnership with a Yooka , was an agent of kunu. All other Ampuku mediums (17) were women, and their spirits had originally been sent to bewitch. Bakuu: This is not a free spirit, like the above, but the witchcraft form of the Yooka - the enslaved ghost of a probably evil person. The 'evil Yooka ' as the Bakuu is also called, owes part of its malevolent powers to the knowledge it retains - as do all Yooka - from a former life on earth. But whose Yooka it was, no one ever knows. No doubt it is non-Djuka. It has since been tampered with, and it may, when possessing a medium in trance, make confusing and contradictory statements about its genealogy. Or it may call the names of present and former owners in lieu of its father and mother. It may be of Creole identity, like the ones of the story, or it may have been brought all the way from China to help Chinese storekeepers earn money. When bought by Djuka, Bakuu are kept in the hen basket and fed on their fa- vorite commercial foods such as tea, coffee, biscuits or corned beef. No Bakuu of 1976 had any taste for blood. For no matter how evil its original nature, the Bakuu like the Ampuku sent to bewitch, al- ways kills on mission for another. As the Djuka say, 'Evil spirits are not evil - the only evil is in the heart of man'. A single Bakuu spirit, like a bewitching Ampuku , is in fact a complex of several spirit forces which must be broken down, like a chemical compound, into parts evil and parts good. The bad parts are paid to remain in the bush while the good are fixed to the human medium as a re-modeled spirit. This particular re structuring is only part of the process of 'washing' and 'fixing' through which a raw spirit is civilized, but it is the major part, and appears to be peculiar to Ampuku and Bakuu alone, in their witchcraft di- mension. Ampuku or Bakuu As a new agent of witchcraft, then, the Bakuu seems at first sim- ply to double for the bewitching Ampuku among Djuka residing most of the year on the coast. (In the four known cases of posses- sion before 1976, all mediums lived outside the tribal village and in three of these the witch did too). Then, from 1976 on, it appears that a ban on in-village Bakuu revelations was lifted with the Boo- kopali case (although attempts had been made even earlier against another scapegoat), and it was suddenly demonstrated that villagers back home were also threatened: by the Bakuu which the immi- grant workers could bring back in their luggage. Nor are opportunities to acquire this holocaust form of evil limit- ed these days only to the itinerant husbands and sons. Wives are</page><page sequence="15">BAKUU 15 often taken to the city on shopping sprees, and old mothers who might never have left tribal territory may now be flown to the coast for a period of medical treatment. Even those who are villagebound may acquire a Bakuu second-hand from spouse or relative, inherit or steal one from a deceased witch. The imported Bakuu has been incorporated into the multifarious repertoire of black arts back home. Yet, a comparison of cases of Bakuu and Ampuku possession in Tabiki suggests that Djuka may be experimenting with functional differences for each. In either case, the ecstatic victims of witchcraft were the same: all (but one) were woman, none of whom (with one exception) had even been medium to any spirit before. As for the witch, the sender of an Ampuku seemed to be visualized as a wom- an, while a Bakuu buyer could be of either sex. In noting the symptoms of an Ampuku or Bakuu attack of ill- ness, which preceeded possession trance of the mediums, one re- marks an interesting distinction, not so much in the types of illnes- ses attributed to each spirit, but in their duration. The histories of Ampuku attacks are a mournful tale of many accidents, or chronic ailments that stretch back over the years sometimes to childhood, and of various attempts to come to grips with the unknown evil - probably entailing many different diagnoses, until finally the witch- craft is detected by a third person (an obiaman) who through many washings in appropriate baths, manages to tame the Ampuku spirit sufficiently for it to surface from the body to the head, leave off its attack and settle for dialogue. Both victim and family express relief that a cure is now in sight. The histories of Bakuu attacks are remarkably short by compari- son: one accident, not many, usually from a few months to a few days, to a few hours suffering before the Bakuu takes possession of the victim in trance (sometimes even without the aid of a third party to diagnose and tame the spirit - see, in the story below, the cases of Naami and Koli). Both victim and family are incensed against the Bakuu buyer, and they make no secret of his identity even though the village lanti may censor such revelations. In 18 cases of Ampuku possession I was never able to learn the identity of the sender, even though two</page><page sequence="16">16 DIANE VERNON of my most cooperative informants were Ampuku mediums. On the contrary, Bakuu mediums were unabashed tattlers, and either they themselves or an informant from the same lineage could tell me who the witch had been. What this suggests is that victims of Ampuku witchcraft use pos- session as a means of dealing with illness, while Bakuu victims use illness as a lever to launch ecstatic witch accusations. Furthermore, judging from the cases I recorded, a bewitching Ampuku is but one spirit hired to attack one person (woman) and perhaps her child. I know of no instance where such a spirit threat- ened a wider group. Once the Ampuku reveals itself in trance and is turned away (by exorcism) or tamed (by 'washing'), its original attack is discontinued. If it sickens its medium or one of her family after that, it is usually because someone has offended it, and it can be persuaded to desist. In no case have I heard of its having a son or brother spirit secretly pursuing the original witchcraft. Yet this is exactly what occurs in most Bakuu attacks. A Bakuu is not one spirit; and a Bakuu winti (possessing spirit) is not the whole Bakuu. The Bakuu acts more like a hydra: just one can give rise to an apparently unlimited number of attacking, possessing spirits. Thus, the taming of one of these spirits does not bring the witchcraft to an end, as the 'cooling' of the single Ampuku does (though it brings the witchcraft under control for that one victim). The Bakuu which produced the spirit still skulks in the secrecy of the hen basket in the house of the Bakuu buyer, ready to send out other spirits at his command. The benefit the public can derive from civilizing a Bakuu spirit however, is that it may become a turncoat, spying on new moves of the Bakuu buyer, detecting new Bakuu attacks by its brothers, and helping to chaperone neophyte Bakuu winti. In other words, while Ampuku seems to be witchcraft aimed at one individual (and possibly her child), the Bakuu can unleash its spirits throughout a whole family of brothers and sisters, or a seg- ment, or a lineage, or across the boundaries of lineages over the affi- nal bridge. And this is another interesting aspect of Bakuu witchcraft. It seems apt to proliferate along affinal lines in a mirror imitation of</page><page sequence="17">BAKUU 17 'good' magical power wielded by obiaman, wintiman, and basi , for whom marriage opens up new opportunities of extending activity and influence into the spouse's lineage. The two different Bakuu dramas which rocked Tabiki from 1976 to 1978 involved the vil- lage's two largest lineages, Pedi and Kaysina, which are linked through many marriages. In both cases, the accusations passed from one lineage to the other through these bonds: in one case, the wife in the other lineage was named victim, in the other, cited be- low, she was dubbed accomplice. Use of Bakuu expression for launching witchcraft accusations against the affinal lineage is apparently not a speciality of Tabiki. Thoden VAN Velzen informs me he witnessed about a dozen cases of conflicts between affinal lineages over Bakuu which were brought before the Gaan Gadu oracle at Diitabiki in 1961 from the villages of Malobi, Vandaki and Tsjontsjon. A full-blown Bakuu ac- cusation may pit one affinal lineage against the other, allowing an opportunity to express anger over issues which probably could not be broached directly. (Thus, following on the coat-tails of the suc- cesful Bakuu accusation recounted below, a particularly frustrated segment of Kaysina lineage, whose candidate to the Gedeonsu priesthood has been waiting for years for the headman to ratify his appointment, launched an obviously well-thought out Bakuu accu- sation against the headman's elder uncle who had taken a wife from their midst). Conversely, a Bakuu accusation may unite two affinal lineages in anger against a traitor in their midst, allowing a backlog of tragedies to be laid at his feet. So it was that one Da Bookopali was first denounced as having bought two Bakuu (a reproductive couple) to use against his matri- linear relatives. It was then quickly discovered that he had in fact bought four - two for himself and two for his wife in the other lin- eage, when this lineage decided to enter a complaint. A year later a teen-age boy, whose sister Koli had recently been possessed by the spirit of the first Bakuu , awoke one night to see a party of twelve Bakuu stalking the village, and one of them was pregnant! When I returned briefly in 1979, I learned that Da Bookopali had in addition a storehouse full of Bakuu located in his abandoned bush camp, and that some of these had accidently been imported</page><page sequence="18">IB DIANE VERNON into Tabiki with a load of his benches, killing a child in yet another lineage segment. Case of Kaysina iii &amp; Pedi h vs. Da Bookopali At the end of December 1976, Da Bookopali, who like so many other Tabiki men spent most of the year working on the coast as a manual laborer, was returning home for the holidays. But he al- ready knew this home-coming wasn't something to look forward to. In his absence, two spirit mediums had openly accused him of buying Bakuu to kill his fellow villagers. Da Bookopali is a man in his late fourties. He is a member of his mother's lineage, Kay si- na III; his father belonged to Pedi I. About fifteen years ago, Bookopali set up housekeep- ing with Ma Bolon of Pedi II in what was for both of them a second marriage, and they had three children. Bookopali is reputed for a sneaky disposition and a violent temper, and it is said people were afraid of him and careful not to cross him. But if he handed out beatings, it seems he collected them as well, and one of these is thought to have caused his failing eyesight. For somewhere upward of twenty years, Bookopali had periodically lived and farmed in a region called Gaa Kaba, where part of Kaysina III, of Pedi I, and of Amanta lineages have bush camps, and where Bookopali' s parents and several of his real brothers and sisters resid- ed. Between 1 5 and 20 years ago, a witch accusation broke out between members of these bush camps which involved a number of the protagonists of the 1976 Bakuu case. The hus- band of Bookopali' s sister Atjalibaa was accused by another brother-in-law of having be- witched him. On the side of the accusers were Bookopali's uncles - Papa Poku, Da Diiwan, and the now deceased Papa X. Although no one had died, and no oracle had spoken, the of- fended brother-in-law together with Papa X and Bookopali, tricked Atjalibaa' s husband into coming into their camp, then set upon him and beat him up. Bookopali followed up this first attack with two more assaults, aided in one by Papa X. Papa X, was himself subsequently ac- cused of witchcraft - against the daughter of another of Bookopali's sisters. Over ten years ago, Bookopali's father died. Then a brother of Bookopali became ill in Gaa Kaba, and was sent to the city for treatment, where he also died. Five years ago, Booko- pali's mother fell ill, and the family bush camp in Gaa Kaba began to break up. Bookopali and several brothers went off to the coast to work, their sister Atjalibaa moved across river with her new husband; and Ma Bolon (Bookopali's wife) returned to Tabiki to cut fields. In 1974-75, the grown son of Atjalibaa from her first marriage shot himself in despair over losing his wife. Sometime in the year 1976, Bookopali's retinal infection which Tabikans put down to a thrashing he had received for playing with another man's wife, took a turn for the worse, and blindness set in. It was only later that the blindness was understood to have been caused by the Bakuu. The first cry of alarm was sounded by Sa Mooite, a classificatory sister of Bookopali, who after two years of illness, went into trance in her bush camp home at Gaa Kaba, in September 1976. Her ailment vanished and was replaced by an outspoken spirit claiming to be a Bakuu. This raw winti was tended to on the spot by the husband of Mooite' s aunt, a basi from another village who often resides in Gaa Kaba. He did not censor the winti, nor did the Tabiki lanti when it was presented to them at the end of that month.</page><page sequence="19">BAKUU 19 There it was seen by Sa Pikinsa of Pedi II before she returned to her own bush camp at Ampona Tapu. The following month Pikinsa herself was stricken with toothache, where- upon a second Bakuu winti came into her head, claiming to be the brother of the first, but having been sent by Ma Bolon. Pikinsa returned to Tabiki to have it 'washed' and 'fixed' by Da Iyeemi, basi of her lineage segment, and lantiman. He did not silence the winti either. 'Washing' Judging from the materials I saw prepared in the village and from talks with Djuka partici- pants, 'washing' - that process of conversion which separates the good spirit parts from the bad, leaving the latter behind in the bush and fixing the good to the medium - is practi- cally identical for Bakuu and Ampuku. The prefered basi for this work are those 'who know how to fix Bakuu ' or those with Kumanti spirits. The 'washing' takes place in the bush. An offering is left at the base of a tree as payment to the evil parts: rhum, cane juice, two eggs, one parrot feather, red corn, peanuts, rice, a chopped tuberous vegetable, and a live rooster. Tiny flags are confectioned and planted there. Two separate mixtures of plants and spices are macerated: one for the medium to drink to 'break the tongue' of the spirit so that it can speak in public; the other to bathe the medium's body, to 'cool the heart' of the spirit and bring it under control of the basi. Finally, the separation of good and evil forces that compose the spirit is effected by the me- dium's severing a root of singafu (genus Costus , family Zingiberaceae) which had been painted black and white. The black is discarded, and the white wand is carried off by the me- dium. The basi must then provide the new medium with ties to wear around the neck whenever the winti possesses its medium. These contain 'medicine' which keeps the spirit under con- trol, like a portable basi. He also makes bench, table, flag, and in some cases a stick - to re- place the one with which the Bakuu knocks down its victims - and is supposed to provide a calabash, to store the ties and pemba (kaolin). By January, Mooite's spirit had received two washings and was ready for public revelations. (Pikinsa' s was still not sufficiently con- verted to add more than a chorus to the hearings. At the end of Jan- uary, it was passed on to Papa Poku, a basi fu Kumanti (Kumanti basi) of Kaysina III, for a second washing). So it was that by the time Da Bookopali arrived in the village two women from the largest lineages in Tabiki were possessed by spirits - government-tested and unexpurgated - claiming to have been sent by him. Bookopali did the rounds of all the lantiman , trying to convince each of his innocence. Then, on January 7th, before a large council and a huge gathering of villagers, Mooite revealed in trance that Bookopali had already killed seven people. None of these deaths was recent. The last Tabikan to have died was Atja- libaa's son, and the Bakuu was not responsible for that demise. But now a window on the past had been opened: one by one, deaths that had not been explained could be blamed on the Bakuu. Further- more, alleged the spirit, Bookopali, not satisfied with those</page><page sequence="20">20 DIANE VERNON murders, had planned to kill Mooite, her brother, her sister, their uncle Papa Poku, and one of Bookopali's own sisters. So far, none of them was sick. Bookopali had of course not been called to the council, nor did he join the audience, but his house was close enough for him to hear. Perhaps in despair, perhaps in hopes of some supernatural revenge, he tried to commit suicide by drinking vinegar. This merely added to the conviction that he had a hard heart. After recovering, he was called before a small gathering of lantiman. He was now completely blind and had to be led. The lanti invited him to reveal all he knew (i.e. confess) so they could help him. But he went on denying any knowledge of Bakuu. In his defense, he told stories which demon- strated his honesty, and his preference for good magic: Da Iyeemi himself had given him Papa magic for making money in the city. The Bakuu accusations, he suggested, might be a trick of the kunu of his lineage whose medium having died, could no longer warn of its displeasure. The next day, under a scorching afternoon sun, Pikinsa and Mooite, both in trance, strode, bellowing, through the village to- ward Bookopali's house drawing a crowd in their wake. They stop- ped before his door where he sat, and stood flailing their arms and screaming at him. Then Pikinsa lunged at the blind man with a stick. Mooite picked up a stool and waved it over the scapegoat, feig- ning an attack, while insinuating herself between the prostrate man and her violent partner, until the villagers could part them. That evening both winti were called before a council. Pikinsa' s seemed to have spent itself in the fight and made no appearance. Mooite' s descended and declared that it would not ad- dress the lanti again until it had fought once more with Bookopali. The lanti begged it not to, and it promptly and graciously relented. Hearings From the 19th to the 21st of January, four councils were convened to philosophize and doze on their benches while waiting for the spirits to possess their mediums and produce further revelations. The mediums would sit facing the lanti for sometimes as long as an hour before full pos- session would be achieved. This would be heralded by sporadic belching, hissing, laughing, humming, bowing from the waist, and finally, as the spirit came in stronger, by short meta- phors for the Bakuu , in lieu of the normal spirit litany, barked out in sequences that ended on a rising inflection: ' Saatu-saatuman! (short-short man)! Jombo-jomboman! (jump-up</page><page sequence="21">BAKUU 21 jump up man), Waka-tuakaman! (hanky-panky man or visitor), Koli-koliman! (cheating- man), Wedri-wedriman! (crazy-crazy man), Bai-baiman! (bought man), Tu-tusensiman! (two-pence-two pence man). Bakuu spirits speak Sranan tongo , the coastal pidgin that all Djuka understand. But their version is not the rapid staccatto of the city, but rather ressembles the slow, carefully enunciated speech of the radio announcer who broadcasts each evening to the interior. The two women (whose spirits are male) used low registers, thus heightening the similarity and their opening greetings to the assembly 'Kondreman, kondreman... Famili, famili! ' are precisely those heard on the radio. During the four sessions, no further revelations were made. Mooite's winti, acting as spokesman for the two would ceremoniously greet each lantiman in turn, then sit down again, saying: 'I have nothing for today'. The winti seemed to prefer the night and the company of their quarter mates for their oracular additions. But these formal reunions with the lanti, and the laughing and joking with Mooite's spirit may have served to reassure the village that dialogue and friendly relations were now established with these two formerly evil spirits of the hidden bakuu. Propitiation Since spirits are best pacified with offerings, three feasts were held from February 18th through 20th, consisting of traditional Djuka dishes prepared by the women, coastal deleca- cies, and a large variety of beverages. The cost of this lavish meal was borne by the people of Kaysina III, and it was held each time in a different house of the quarter under the direction of Papa Poku. As is usual with ritual food offerings, the participants were mostly men: lanti and others, who crowded into the one-room house while the women peeked through the doors and windows. The first hour was taken up with speeches - by each lantiman - then, by the winti, who sat on their consecrated benches before the tables of food until Mooite's spirit teasingly asked 'Who is all the food for?', and rose to play host. The assembled men became her guests, sharing in the drinks as the winti opened the bottles. The food was left to be collected later by the women. Theoretically, only two feasts were planned, however, on February 20th, yet a third one was held because Mooite's spirit esteemed the first two inadequate. The mediumships of Pikinsa and Mooite Until Da Iyeemi passed on to Papa Poku the troublesome winti of Pikinsa for a second washing, the young medium seemd to devote her trances merely to accompanying Mooite's spirit, which, as 'older brother' spoke for both. But after the second washing, Pikinsa's winti suddenly grew up, found its voice, and proffered new material on its own initiative. Of the 1 5 sessions I saw of Pikinsa's winti, at least nine of these occurred spontaneously in the evening, at night, or in the early morning - times when quarter members are most likely to be at home and to themselves, and may be drawn by the call of a next-door winti. Though many of these sessions were concerned with the medium's own problems in rela- tion to her second basi , in two, and perhaps three sessions, this winti helped fill out the Bakuu victim list (which by then included: Bookopali's dead brother, Akaapa's dead son, Papa Poku's dead son), by adding to it the names of sick and dead from her lineage segment. In this quarter, the Bakuu which had been used was the one Bookopali had given his wife, Bolon. Certainly, the most shocking of the winti ' s revelations was that Bolon had used the Bakuu to kill her own son several years ago! (This was not Bookopali's child, but one by a former husband from another village). Another dead victim from the past was probably also named by Pikinsa's spirit - that of Ba Motolu' s young brother, also of Pedi II. Accounting for these dead triggered off fresh tears, and no doubt an abiding anger against</page><page sequence="22">22 DIANE VERNON Ma Bolon, but the period of mourning for them had long been over. Much more dangerous was Pikinsa's revelations that the one-night colic of Ba Motolu' s baby was an attack of Bolon' s bakuu. Ba Motolu flew into a rage, and it was fortunate that in keeping with the inhi- bition on violence, Pikinsa had chosen a moment for this disclosure - as for the others - when Bolon was away from the village. Bolon was convicted by the winti - as Bookopali had been - in absentia, paradoxically for her own sake. From the end of February on, Pikinsa's spirit began to practice some magic: during one session, her winti invited a pregnant quarter member to be rubbed with eggs and rhum for a good delivery; during another, it diagnosed the miscarriage of a classificatory sister's child, as the attack of an unidentified witch and offered vulnerable members of the family preven- tive remedies. It even joined the Kumanti spirits of Pedi II in one of their last attempts to ef- fect a cure on the dying wife of a quarter member. But these instances were opportunistically brought about by the spirit itself. With one ex- ception, all of Pikinsa's magical practice of 76-78 took place during the two months when the prestigious obiaman of the quarter, Da Iyeemi, was absent. Perhaps, the presence of this magician, with his reputable clinic of subordinate Kumanti wintiman left little opportunity for minor independent mediums to find clientele even among immediate neighbors. Before the new year of 1978, Pikinsa never even practised magic in a waking state. After the new year, the medium found herself pregnant, and was therefore unlikely to go into trance again for another year. Of Mooite's early mediumship, I know much less, for I did not live in the same quarter with her, and was never present at a spontaneous appearance. I presume that Mooite also tested out her oracles first within the privacy of her quarter. The only informal seance I wit- nessed with her was on the demand of the headman Da Akaapa, who requested that this pri- mary Bakuu spirit be called, to learn if it were satisfied with the food offerings. The audience was composed mostly of quarter members, and Mooite's spirit proceeded to draw out the session for four hours - telling stories, joking, singing, and showing off her possessions. She used the seance for a private triumph over Papa Poku and his daughter (a bush camp neighbor), declaring the feasts he had organized failures, and diagnosing his daughter's ill- ness as due to the breaking of a taboo, for which she had immediately to submit to treat- ment. At the beginning of March 1977, Mooite disappeared from the major village to her bush camp in Gaa Kaba, where the clusters of other Tabikans camping there - lineage mates, af- fines, friends, and the basi who had washed her winti - offered a complex social scene in which to practice. The obiaman Da Iyeemi, who was married to Mooite's sister, would spend a few months of each year with them in their camp which he had helped build, and he included Mooite as a subordinate in his magical practice. With the Ampuku winti of her mati (formal friend), who camped on the next island, Mooite wove oracular intrigues. And over the untutored Bakuu winti which was later to possess Bookopali' s niece Koli, Mooite assumed a certain temporary command when Koli returned to Gaa Kaba to alight in the bush camp of her new husband. The aftermath: unpopular contributions Until the end of March 1977, the accusations against Bookopali and his accomplice wife, with their revelations of past tragedies, had unfolded in a village where no death had oc- curred for almost two years. Then abruptly, just as the accusation was waning, Bookopali 's sister, Atjalibaa committed suicide. Her death seemed to usher in a whole series of tragedies in Tabiki. Yet, none of these - not even the worsening illness of Bookopali' s mother - was laid at the Bakuu 's feet. With the rehashing of 5 past deaths, the accusation seemed to have at least temporarily spent itself. (It was to know a brief revival in 1979 when the death</page><page sequence="23">BAKUU 23 of a child from Pedi I, was attributed to it). Suddenly, on May 2, 1977, Sa Naami landed in Tabiki, and still in her city clothes, she stalked into Pedi II, possessed by a vociferous Bakuu winti which began to harangue Ma Bolon accusing her of further Bakuu crimes. For while the New Years accusation had been breaking over the village, Naami had been with it in spirit: away in the coastal city, the same Bakuu - which had sent spirits after Pikinsa and Mooite - had sent another of its winti to hit Naami over the head, leaving her unconscious, with a gash in her scalp. Left to her own devices, Naami found some commercial product which she rubbed on her skin in perhaps an impromptu imitation of the plant washing techniques of Djuka medecine, and when the burning subsided, the bakuu winti possessed her in trance. She had returned to the village to have this new spirit attended to. The reaction to this third bakuu manifestation was general dismay. Two mediums had al- ready been recognized, one for each of the major Tabiki lineages: each had pointed out the culprit within her own quarter and had revealed past and prospective victims. The winti had been properly attended to and propitiated and had now been integrated into the realm of positive religion, where their knowledge of evil made them specialists in the detection of witchcraft. There was no need for new witnesses - Naami was flogging a dead horse. The best she could manage was to rekindle hostility in a few women of her lineage seg- ment; her real sister who lived in her husband's quarter next door to Bookopali, and Pikinsa herself - whose spirit immediately recognized Naami' s as a younger brother and treated it as such, assuming the role of an unofficial basi in response to Naami 's needs. In July, Bookopali returned from the hospital where he had gone in a vain attempt to find help for his eyes, and a few days later Naami and Pikinsa both in trance, led an attack on the scapegoat. Although the aggression was still made in the safety of daylight, they had chosen a time when the village was practically deserted and the headman was away. This time, two other women, one of them Naami's above-mentioned sister, joined the furies. An artery in Bookopali' s neck was severed. By a miracle of magic made on the spot by two Kumanti me- diums of Kaysina III, the bleeding was stopped and the accused survived. Kabiten Akaapa returned in anger to upbraid the unruly spirits, and the attack was not repeated. Now the violence of Naami's uncared-for winti turned against her, tormenting her with vague complaints. By the New Year, her winti was diagnosing as the cause of her 18 year- old-son's nervous disorder, the neglect it was shown. Both she and her husband applied to Da Iyemmi, who gave the boy a Kumanti spirit to protect him, but the basi wanted no part of the new bakuu winti , and 2 years after her arrival in Tabiki, Naami was still waiting for attention. The lack of interest which Naami's spirit inspired should have discouraged further appari- tions. By the new year 1978 a new Bakuu accusation launched against a new culprit had captured popular imagination. Then, at the annual dance oí Papa spirits, Bookopali's niece, Sa Koli, (daughter of Atjalibaa) fell writhing to the ground. A few days later, the spirit re- vealed itself as yet another winti from the Bookopali Bakuu. Koli, in trance, strode over to her uncle's door and bellowed out in bakuu dialect. Bookopali invited the possessed inside. When she crossed his threshold, he turned the tables by launching an attack himself, biting the girl on the head, and tearing out tuffs of her hair. They were parted by a rush of villagers. Aftermath for a scapegoat Bookopali had begun by losing his sight, which made him totally dependent on others, at the same time that the accusation deprived him of all those on whom he might have depen- ded. Ma Bolon abandoned him at the outbreak of the trouble, trying in vain to save herself from a similar ostracism, but she continued to send him food by the children. All other ser-</page><page sequence="24">24 DIANE VERNON vices were refused him - except that of magic performed to save his life or a magical treat- ment which he paid for. He would sit in front of his house in hopes of visitors but the only ones who stopped to chat were other-lineage people up from the city. Knowing himself un- welcome, he never visited anyone, but he carried on a vicarious social life by prowling on cat's feet and eavesdropping on others. When yet a fourth Bakuu winti came to molest him in the person of his niece, he took matters into his own hands. With no one else to speak for him, he requested permission to address an already assembled lanti which was in council for the end of mourning rites. His proposal was to take his case before the court of the Paramount chief and accept its verdict and the consequences thereof. He was reminded that such a procedure was out of order: a defendent cannot take himself to court - only his accusers can do that. The death rate continued to be high for Tabiki through Spring 1979, yet only one of these deaths was attributed to the Bookopali Bakuu' that of a child who was on the shore when a Tabikan boatman did Bookopali one of the few favors he had known since the accu- sation by delivering to him some chairs he had left behind in his abandoned bush camp of Gaa Kaba. Was the outcome of divination a reminder that Bookopali was to be ostracized by all? HOW THE ACCUSATION SPREAD Quarter and camp The accusation seems to have broken out first in segment III of Kaysina lineage which occupies a quarter of the village called Maki- sitalaan , taken over and settled from the Pedi bee people, about 50 years ago by Papa Poku and Papa X. Yet, only part of this quarter ever seems to have been involved: those descendents of two sisters (B + C) who have cut out their separate but neighboring bush camps on the islands at Gaa Kaba. Fig. 3. Skeleton genealogy of Kaysina III - Makisitalaan</page><page sequence="25">BAKUU 25 The primary mouthpiece of the accusation, Mooite, shares one bush camp there with two of Bookopali's 'future victims' - her brother and sister. The other people she named as menaced by Bakuu attack - Papa Poku and Bookopali's sister, were also Gaa Kaba residents. Ma Bolon had only lately abandoned the fields she and Bookopali planted there, and her Bakuu is said to have attacked the baby of Da Motolu, who spends the farming session in Gaa Kaba with his wife, Papa Poku' s niece. The mother of this young woman has her own bush camp there, and is married to the basi who washed Mooite's winti. Others, such as the lately possessed Koli, or deceased victims like Bookopali's brother, also lived there, and active behind-the-scene sponsors of the accusation such as Da Iyeemi have personal interests in that area. While people of other lineages farming there were passed over by the oracle, all those of Kaysina III (with the exception of one small family) were implicated - either accusing or accused or named as victims or involved in the trimming and tutoring of new winti, or being voluntarily or unwittingly assimilated to the new medium's clientele. Affinal Links Most of the population of Tabiki belong to one of the two major lineages of Pedi and Kaysina: the first is the seat of secular power, the second the seat of oracular power in the form of a tribal god, and a continuing struggle for dominance is played out between the two. At the same time, much unites these rival groups - member- ship in one clan of which Da Akaapa is the head, residence in one village, and above all the many marriages contracted between these two lineages. Judging by the list of people said to be victimized, the Bookopali accusation seems to lay particular stress on affinal links between Pedi and Kaysina. Collaboration between the two lineages began with the naming of Bookopali's wife as the other half of an infernal couple. Each of these 'witches' had also been a child of a marriage between the two lineages. Among those either threatened, posses- sed, or killed by the bakuu spirits, the following are either off- springs of such marriages or have contracted one themselves, or both:</page><page sequence="26">26 DIANE VERNON child of contracted both Koli Mooite's sister Naami Motolu' s brother Motolu Bookopali's brother Akaapa's son Poku's son g G e QO &lt;u &amp;o of a 03 « O ao o QJ c ac Já "ÕJ J* oo £</page><page sequence="27">BAKUU 27 G OJ e oc &lt;L&gt; c/5 QJ 00 OJ O» C Oh 13 ao jd &lt;u G CU oo G O jy 'õ; oo ir' oo h</page><page sequence="28">28 DIANE VERNON At the same time, that the two lineages were cooperating in de- nouncing the guilty, however, Pedi II was subtly promoting a 'less guilty than thou' version with Ma Bolon becoming an ever more white-washed accomplice, and the evil of Bookopali used as proof of the dubious morals of Kaysina people. Remarked one Pedi II member: 'Makisitalan will break the village!'. Naami, who retur- ned to Tabiki railing at Bolon, had to be cued in. A month later, she decided that this classificatory sister was really innocent. While Pedi II wanted to participate in the accusation, its naming of Bolon seems simply to have brought the danger of Bookopali nearer to home, touching off persecutory feelings at that level of social struc- ture where VAN Wetering (1973) found them to be most inflam- mable: that matrisegment of daily contact which one Djuka women referred to as 'where one sweeps one's door sill'. Mediums We have already seen that Mooite and Pikinsa, by assuming the double identity of villagers victimized by the Bakuu attack and the possessed spokesman of the Bakuu spirits pleading guilty to the cri- mes, created an open and shut case against the accused. But how- ever expedient such possession is for launching an accusation, it ap- pears to be the prerogative of those whose reputations can afford it: who are neither lantiman nor religious specialists. Lantiman are supposed to be personally under the protection of the great ances- tors, while spirit mediums are watched over by their winti who would defend them against possession by a bewitching spirit. In all but one case, Tabikans who had been possessed by or become me- diums to an Ampuku or a Bakuu spirit had never known medium- ship before. (In a few cases, women were medium to both a be- witching Ampuku and a Papa spirit, but it was always the bewit- ching one which had come first). The women possessed by the Bakuu winti were able to assume ecstatic leadership of a public expression, but they remained depen- dent on the support of the lanti. Their licence to accuse could al- ways be called into question, as it almost was by Da Akaapa, who, at last, exasperated by the assaults on Bookopali (whose death would certainly bring in the police and jeopardize the headman's excellent relations with Diitabiki (Thoden VAN VelzEN, pers.</page><page sequence="29">BAKUU 29 comm.), dropped his respectful appelations and referred to the me- diums as, little ladies who run around the village with winti screaming in their heads trying to kill people'. Lanti Obviously, since for once the headman neglected to silence the winti, the accusations of Mooite and Pikinsa were receiving prefer- ential support. Was the naming of Da Akaapa's son as former vic- tim and Da Iyeemi's wife as intended one supposed to invite or re- ward the cooperation of these important figures? Did Da Iyemmi use his influence on his headman uncle (to whom he owes his posi- tion as basia) to help his in-laws in Gaa Kaba, uncover a long-bre- wing suspicion? Certainly, he made his own contributions to the evidence if it is true that he went out one night in trance, possessed by his great ancestor spirit, to beat the Bakuu off the roofs of the menaced Pedi II homes. At least, in a waking state, he emphatically stated that Bookopali had bought Bakuu, and later, when Pikinsa's revelations raised anger at Ma Bolon, that people ' . . . should fight with Bolon, make her see!'. But other statesmen too, even from other lineages, made their contributions. One bore witness to having actually caught sight of the Bakuu itself sitting on Bookopali' s table, while the guilty man tried to distract him from the evidence. And the day after Bookopa- li' s pleas of innocence, both Da Akaapa and the basia of Kaysina voiced their regret at the scapegoat's 'lack of cooperation' and 'in- ability to tell the story straight'. Why was a witch accusation, which was so explosive that Booko- pali barely escaped being lynched, treated as something so respect- able by a village government concerned about keeping down violen- ce? Judging from the attention shown the first two mediums, it was the revelations of Mooite and Pikinsa that interested the lanti. Per- haps by proffering them the accusation was serving a very respect- able function. The Oracle Almost from the beginning, the accusation became an oracle, re- viewing a backlog of tragedies: five deaths from the past were attri- buted to Bookopali' s Bakuu. All deaths and most illnesses are seen</page><page sequence="30">30 DIANE VERNON by Djuka as having a spirit cause. And the danger may cast a long shadow over the future: an avenging spirit will kill one lineage member after another until it is propitiated. Before 1972, when the new prophet Akalali put an end to the practice, the cause of a demise used to be established in a last dialo- gue with the ghost of the deceased by carrying his corpse as an oracle. Now that post mortem interrogation is forbidden, if a spiri- tual diagnosis has been decided on as the cause of the terminal ill- ness, then it is put down as the cause of death. (Of the six deaths which occurred in Tabiki from May 1977 to the end of the year, only two - that of Atjalibaa and that of a young man stabbed in a knife fight in the city, could not immediately be accounted for). Problems seem to arise most often in the case of death from acci- dents (such as the above), or from illnesses which evolve too quick- ly. But even in these cases, there is surreptitious speculation and consultation of mediums until one day the death is spontaneously accounted for by the oracle of a winti. Four of five deaths put down to the Bakuu had occurred since the ban on corpse-carrying in 1972. (The one that happened prior to this date was that of Bookopali's brother who died in the city, and was not brought back for examination and burial). Two were caused by accidents, two others by illness, in one case evolving rap- idly. I was unable to verify whether or not any of these had been diagnosed earlier. Informants denied having 'heard what killed them before'. It seems likely that what the lanti was underwriting was a very positive function of oracular autopsy: the evil Bakuu spirits were rendering a traditional service in accounting for past deaths. The Bakuu as a symbol In addition to this oracular use of the accusation, this first publi- cized discovery of a Bakuu in their midst seems to have rallied the fears and moral indignation of Tabikans from every quarter against an uncontrollable evil introduced from the outside. For during the course of the year other witch accusations were voiced: Ampuku were sent against women, sickened them, possessed them, and were quietly washed; spirit mediums in trance saw and denounced witches; inter-lineage brawls over witchcraft took place; two con-</page><page sequence="31">BAKUU 31 temporary deaths were attributed to the witchcraft of two living wo- men. . . but all of these were circumscribed events affecting a small group, village headlines for a day. The Bakuu witchcraft of Booko- pali, although it began as an equally local affair within part of a lin- eage segment, whipped up anger and persecutory feelings in seg- ments with no victims to declare. An ever-multiplying number of Bakuu could be seen wandering about the village at night. ' Obia - man don't know anything about Bakuu, ' explained one woman, 'they too are afraid'. The very traditionalist Da Iyeemi took this opportunity to re- mind people of the constant threat to the village posed by returning Djuka men who secreted these monstrous coastal weapons in their luggage. Do such popular Bakuu accusations as that against Booko- pali express the negative aspects of immigration and serve as sym- bolic demonstrations of what will happen to immigrant workers who turn traitor to the society back home? 'If Bookopali bought Bakuu then let him leave the village', said the headman, 'let him go live among the bakaaV . As a bakaa money-maker, used by Djuka to make trouble, the Bakuu may symbolize competition between traditionally coopera- tive kinsmen for jobs on the coast; strained relations within the vil- lage over the growing importance of cash exchanges in place of sha- ring; the envy of those who are village-bound. As a self-reproducing agent of destruction to which the tradition- al magicians have no answer (13), the Bakuu may stand for invisib- le but real threats to traditional life which do return with the men: attitudes, language, gadgets from the coast which are flaunted as signs of success and superiority, while aspersions are cast on native costume and custom: delinquent activity which the fonti seems unarmed to deal with; and the mysterious fate of community funds which disappear into city banks. Neither religious nor secular authority can at present control the flow of men and their families away from the villages, nor inhibit the foreign influences they in- troduce on their return. 'All those men who bring Bakuu up from the city,' cried Da Iyeemi, 'the ancestors should strike them down!'.</page><page sequence="32">32 DIANE VERNON BAKUU PROSPECTS How important is the Bakuu pantheon in Tabiki and what are its prospects for the future? In 1976, the situation there gave the cu- rious impression that in spirits Bakuu Tabikans were starting from scratch. The Bakuu of the fortune-hunting era have disappeared without a trace if ever they were there. One informant vaguely re- called that a long time ago, a man of Tabiki had protected his fields with a Bakuu and that the theft of his bananas had brought it's spir- it down on them as a kunu. But it didn't stay long. Apparently, since 1973, a new Bakuu pantheon is building up, composed en- tirely of bewitching spirits. Prior to the outbreak of the Bookopali case in October 1976, out of 73 spirits possessing Tabiki mediums (14), only four were Ba- kuu (or 5%), (as opposed to 20 Kumanti , 20 Papa , 13 Yooka , 16 Ampuku ). By February 1978, ten winti out of a new total of 82 (one medium died that year) were Bakuu or 12%. But how accurate a reflection of the Bakuu phenomenon do these figures offer? While mediums of traditional spirits normally have their winti tended to within tribal territory, where they are seen by fellow villagers and presented to the major village deity (&lt; Gedeonsu ), Bakuu possession more frequently occurs in town, where the Ba- kuu rather than the Ampuku is used to bewitch. When these are small-time accusations between women in the city, the winti are tamed by an immigrant basi there, and may not be seen in the tribal village for several years. This was true of all those Bakuu winti which happened before 1976. Since New Years of both 1977 and 1978, drew few Tabikans back to the native village, there may be more Bakuu winti on the coast - ones that did not make it home for the holidays. Furthermore, since Bakuu possession is essentially witch accusa- tion, it will result in mediumship only if the accusation meets with no objections on the part of the powers that be. If it does, then the Bakuu winti , which is evidence of witchcraft, may be denied its identity and passed off as something else, or be quietly exorcized and replaced by something socially more acceptable. I witnessed one such metamorphosis of a Bakuu winti and was told of others. In fact a close look at the histories of such spirits as Papa and Kumanti whose mediums are women, sometimes reveals that they were put</page><page sequence="33">BAKUU 33 as protecting spirits after an original possession by a bewitching Ampuku or Bakuu. I suspect then that the percentage of spontaneous Bakuu posses- sion in comparison to spontaneous possession by non-bewitching spirits may favor the Bakuu pantheon more than these figures show. If we look at the development that took place during the period October 1976 to February 1978, the total of new spirits for that period (counting those that first came and were identified and those that may have appeared before but were civilized at that time) is 20, and six of these were Bakuu , or 30 % . But if we ask which, of all the spirit categories produced the greatest number of new winti in that period, then it is the new pantheon that dominated the scene: 6 Ba- kuu , 4 Kumanti , 4 Papa , 4 Yooka , 2 Ampuku. (Two of the Ru- manti and one of the Papa were originally bewitching spirits, one of which was a Bakuu). Bakuu mediumship seems to open doors to the same sort of small-time magical-medical practice, which in Tabiki exemplifies the careers of mediums to bewitching Ampuku spirits. But the are- na of opportunity specifically open to Bakuu mediums is perhaps in Bakuu accusations - not only the ones they trigger off but even in later incoming ones where they are given an opportunity to speak. A properly trimmed Bakuu spirit is like a turn-coat which now spies for the other side (i.e. the village). Furthermore, Bakuu me- diums support and provoke one another. It is possible that the exis- tence of a Bakuu pantheon in a village may indirectly stimulate new Bakuu possession. The logical relevance of Bakuu for witch accusations between Djuka living on the coast; the greater outspokenness of the Bakuu winti for major accusations within the tribal village, particularly be- tween it's competing affinal lineages; the anxiety over changing re- lations between Djuka in the context of a tempting, intimidating, threatening rapprochement to Western culture which may be ex- pressed in the nefarious bakuu - these may all contribute to its popularity. When it takes over functions such as diagnosis of past deaths (formerly under the auspice of the grave diggers), then it may be ushered to the fore by the lanti. The Tabiki bakuu pantheon is building up in an interim where</page><page sequence="34">34 DIANE VERNON the higher religious institutions are enjoying less influence: the re- tirement of the Gaan Gadu anti-witchcraft oracle; the aloofness of Tabiki to Akakali's replacement cult; the present neglect of the ma- jor oracle, Gedeonsu , whose licence to operate was the object of a political struggle for domination between the very two lineages - Kaysina and Pedi - which spent the year in collaboration and op- position over Bakuu accusations. While spontaneous Bakuu possession as an expression of perse- cution and aggression seems to have taken root in Bilo religion, treatment of it (mediumship or exorcism) may vary, and the extra functions (e.g. post mortem oracles) it opportunistically takes over, may eventually be more systematically handled by another institu- tion. The emergence of a new cult may quickly impose new limita- tions on Bakuu possession and rob it of the privileges it presently enjoys: those of permanent, respectable mediumship, and govern- ment recognition of its accusations. NOTES 1. 1 wish to thank Jean Hurault and BONNO Thoden VAN Velzen for their valuable help and contributions and Daniel de Coppet for his criticism of an earlier draft. 2. By the term bakuu I denote a type of spirit that is the object of worship of a spirit me- dium cult. These should be distinguished from a more common type of bakuu spirit, also known as taku sani ('evil thing') and usually regarded as connected with bush spir- its in general and the Ampuku in particular (VAN Lier 1940: 191). Here I will refer to this category of bakuu as 'bewitching Ampuku'. Such malevolent spirits torment their victims with illness, insanity or death. They are different from the bakuu I deal with in that they fail to make the invaded persons speak out in coherent language. The fantasies woven around them equally single them out as a different category (THODEN VAN VEL- ZEN, pers. comm.). I have adopted the spelling used by Lenoir rather than the more usual baku (current for other tribes and for the Opo Djuka) to conform with what seems to be a local pronunciation. Mediums in trance use the coastal version bakru. 3. Another visit from May 4 to June 1 ., 1979, allowed me to review the case described be- low at a later stage in its evolution. 4. The following is a summary using material from: DE Groot, 1969; PRICE, 1973; Thoden van Velzen, 1977 &amp; 1978; van der Elst, 1970; Wolbers, (1861) 1952.</page><page sequence="35">BAKUU 35 5. Green, for the Matawai; Herskovits, 1936, for Paramaribo Creoles; Lenoir, 1973, for the Paramacca; WOODING, 1972 for the Para. VAN Lier, 1940, mentions them as less well known among the Djuka than among the Paramacca. HURAULT found the Alu- ku knew of bakuu but he saw no evidence of possession by them at the time (HURAULT, pers. comm). 6. Whites, also, are assumed to be past masters in Bakuu use. 'How could you never have seen one?', retorted an informant, 'The streets in Holland must be teeming with them!'. 7. WOODING (1972 b, pp. 195-196) mentions actual wooden images being made among the Para. 8. The Paramaribo Creoles (Herskovits, 1936), on the contrary, picture Bakuu as res- sembling a Bush Negro child. 9. A similar belief exists among the Creoles of Paramaribo, where the Dagowe (Boa con- strictor ) or Aboma (Anaconda) snake is said to be purchased and kept for 'luck'. This is a milder form of lucrative witchcraft than ownership of Bakru , but with the same tragic ending: it is the family of the owner that suffers, the snake growing jealous of the chil- dren, kills them (Herskovits, 1936). Among the Djuka, no snake is bought: the Papa spirits that ride on these snakes confer to the magician the knowledge of certain recipes (Papa obia) that draw wealth to the practitioner, with no sinister results. This method of obtaining riches belongs entirely to the realm of good magic. 10. As originally described by VAN Lier (194f4), the Bakuu doll had a deformed, hydroce- phalic head. This feature was absent from the 1976 visions, although sicknesses of the head still tended to be associated with it. 1 1 . This concentration of secular power in the smaller of the two major lineages (Pedi) should normally be off-set by the power and privilege which accrue to the Kaysina lin- eage from its licence to operate the village oracle of Gedeonsu - a separation of church and state which is said to have been instituted at the founding of the present village of Tabiki. In the period under question, however, this cult was in a state of suspended animation partly because of the disputed inheritance of the priesthood, partly because of conflicts with a rival village practicing this cult. 12. Religious specialists - obiaman (medecine man), wintiman (spirit mediums), and basi ('boss', exorcist or tailor and tutor of spirits and initiator of their mediums) - also enjoy free-lance privileges. Obiaman usually, but not necessarily, are also spirit me- diums, and derive their magical powers from their possessing spirit. They may, in addition, be basi if they know the technique for socializing one or more types of spirits. 13. Tabikans say that in the upper half of the tribe, Bakuu spirits are exorcised, but it does no good - they always return!'. 14. This count includes absent members of the Pedi clan who retain contact with the native village and the few konlibi (Djuka of other clans but who are permanent members of the village).</page><page sequence="36">36 DIANE VERNON REFERENCES Beet, Chris de &amp; Thoden van Velzen, H.U.E. 1977.
