<plain_text><page sequence="1">tury in the work of the French artist, Au- gustin Dupre, whose efforts must be re- garded as further evidence of the Franco- philia of Benjamin Franklin. America's earliest standard coins were crude indeed, and it is interesting and amusing to watch the development of the Liberty heads, complete with Phrygian cap, become more elaborate and more composed-if not necessarily more physi- cally attractive!-and the eagles on the re- verse become fuller and more powerful. In the early 19th century, our first true neoclassicist, Horatio Greenough, at- tempted to create a new series of designs for our coinage which were not carried out, but other artists of note such as Thomas Sully and Titian Peale did create designs which, though modified, were uti- lized on the 1836 dollar. The Sully design was varied a good deal throughout the century, as to pose, facial type, direction and accessories, but his seated Liberty re- mained fairly constant; Titian Peale's fly- ing, naturalistic eagle, however, though one of the most powerful birds in Ameri- can coinage, was too often replaced by a more heraldic creature. In general during the 19th century, the forms and styles of our coinage were determined, as one might expect, by the engravers at the Mint, men such as Christian Gobrecht, James Barton Longacre, William Barber and his son, Charles E. Barber, men who were rather engravers than sculptors. Medallic art naturally included the de- piction of specific individuals, and might, on their reverse, have scenes relating to those persons, rather than standard, repe- titious allegories. It was early decided, however, that our coinage should not suffer from "the cult of personality." A compromise was offered in 1892, when America's first commemorative coins were issued at the time of the World's Colum- bian Exposition, with a half-dollar featur- ing the head of Columbus on the obverse, and the Santa Maria on the reverse, and a quarter with the head of Queen Isabella. At the same time, the great sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, entered into the field of numismatic art, which provided the history of the subject with its most ex- citing chapter. Saint-Gaudens was first employed as a medalist, and his interest in Renaissance sculpture early made itself felt in his medal commemorating the in- auguration of Washington. Here, the form and dignity of the Washington bust, the nature of the lettering, the use of "stops" and the spacing, all pay homage to the great medalists of the quattrocento, Pisanello and Sperandio. Almost two de- cades later, Saint Gaudens created the fa- mous double-eagle twenty dollar gold- piece, with a striding Liberty derived from the Victory of Samothrace on the obverse, and a soaring eagle on the re- verse which looks back to Titian Peale. It looks back in iconography but not in style or form, for Saint-Gaudens' designs are more exciting and beautiful in their vari- ety and subtlety of relief. This occurred, despite the various practical requirements imposed by the Mint which hobbled nearly all creative artists involved in our coinage-namely the problems of making the designs easily adaptable to the dies, and considerations of wear and of stacking. Saint-Gaudens also designed the ten-dol- lar eagle of 1907, with Liberty in an In- dian bonnet, and a facial type derived from Pergamum. The history of American coinage, incidentally, abounds with tales, some fictional and some probably correct, of the human models of grace and beauty who found an intermediary place between classical origins and relief representation in our coins and medals. If Saint-Gaudens was the guiding spirit in the revolution in American coinage in the early 20th century, the inspired changes which were brought about in our coinage were equally due to President Theodore Roosevelt who inaugurated them. Another numismatic success of Roo- sevelt's era was the five-dollar half eagle of 1908 created by Bela Lyon Pratt, with an Indian head on the obverse, this in startling incised relief, harking back to Ancient Egyptian art. Indian and West- ern subject matter seems to have become increasingly important in American coin- age in the early 20th century, as the ideals of neoclassic allegory faded further and further away and this resulted ultimately in the Indian head and buffalo-nickel of 1913 by James Earle Fraser. The early 20th century was the great era of American coinage, precisely be- cause original, creative sculptors were called in to design. Some, such as Victor Brenner, whom Roosevelt commissioned to create the Lincoln cent of 1909, were not so inspired as Saint-Gaudens, Pratt and Fraser; but others, such as Hermon MacNeil in the 1917 quarter, and particu- larly Adolph Weinman in the 1916 dime and half dollar continued to produce really original designs. Commemorative coins continue to be issued, but their artistic quality exhibits a lack of inventiveness after the surge of creativity of the turn of the century. In standard coinage, the chief innovation of recent years has been the abandonment of allegory, whether classical or Indian "na- tivism" for portrait reliefs, both of the distant great amd the newly deceased. This began with the Washington quarter marking the bicentennial of the birth of our first President, in 1932, followed by the Jefferson nickel and the Franklin half dollar, all taken from busts made in the 18th century by Houdon. More recent presidents so commemorated were Frank- lin Roosevelt in the dime, John Fitzger- ald Kennedy in the 1964 half-dollar. On the basis of these, along with Brenner's earlier Lincoln cent, it would seem as though the inspiration of a great portrait bust in large better serves our coinage than original portraiture for these small reliefs. Mr. Vermuele's book is tremendously informed. It is not a book that can be rec- ommended as general reading since the subject is too specialized and much of the material with which it deals of a less- than-inspired quality, and further, each chapter is fragmented into dozens of smaller sections dealing with specific coins and medals; necessarily so, given the na- ture of the subject. The only points made with which I might argue are some of the suggested classical bases for derivation, at least a few of which would seem highly speculative. A certain amount of termi- nology, both numismatic and classical, is probably unfamiliar to the students and scholars of American art in general, and a glossary of terms would have been a use- ful aid. Perhaps too, the author indulges in personal qualitative judgments and preferences more than one might like, but it may be that the subject itself makes this inevitable. But all these are minor points. Mr. Vermuele has made a substantial con- tribution to a little-studied by-way of American sculpture, and done it in a manner which American art historians of more imposing and "major" art forms would do well to emulate. WILLIAM H. GERDTS Brooklyn College Baroque Art Rudolf Wittkower and Irma B. Jaffe (edi- tors) Baroque Art: The Jesuit Contribu- tion, 139 pp., 64 ill., Fordham University Press, 1972. $20.00 An important beginning to our explo- ration of the Jesuit influence on the art of the seventeenth century was initiated by Fordham University in 1969 when it orga- nized a symposium entitled "Baroque Art: The Jesuit Contribution." Now the papers delivered at the Fordham Sympo- sium have been published in one attrac- tive volume and edited by the late Rudolf Wittkower of Columbia University and Irma Jaffe, chairman of Fordham's art his- tory department. A comprehensive introduction to the subject by Wittkower is followed by an informative discussion of Jesuit architec- ture, in particular the Gesu, by James Ackerman of Harvard who concludes that certain general specifications were sug- gested by the Jesuits for their churches, 472</page><page sequence="2">but both he and Wittkower agree that there was not a Jesuit style which affected significant forms of architecture. Howard Hibbard of Columbia gives a good description of the paintings which were originally commissioned to decorate the Gesui, and he makes the point that the program was conceptual, like a sermon, with no aesthetic direction of unity. He also points out that even artists of differ- ent styles were chosen to do the work and that their sources varied from medieval to contemporary. Very appropriately Francis Haskell of Oxford asks why there was no Jesuit style. He concludes that it was the Jesuits' overriding desire for austerity. However, he does reveal that there was one General of the Order, Oliva, who had a feeling for the arts, and that it was during the rule of Oliva that Bernini, Baciccio, and Pozzo were engaged to decorate Jesuit churches in Rome. The longest essay, and perhaps the most complex, is Rend Taylor's entitled "Hermetism and Mystical Architecture." Dr. Taylor deals primarily with the Span- ish Jesuit Juan Bautista Villalpando's re- construction of the Temple of Solomon based on the prophecy of Ezechiel and with Father Kircher's reconstructions of Noah's Ark and the Tower of Babel. The particular interest at this time in the first two buildings was their reflection of God's will, and both of these theologians in their writings linked Christian mysticism with Hermetic thinking (namely, astrol- ogy, numerology, anthropomorphism, the microcosm-macrocosm, etc.) The last two essays deal with the Jesuits and two other cultural expressions: the- ater and music. Per Bjurstrom, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Nationalmu- seum, Stockholm, introduces his subject, theater, by informing us that "Jesuit drama began as a bid to compete with the other pleasures which Rome offered the students of the colleges who considered themselves entitled to some kind of enter- tainment during the carnival. From these tactical beginnings Jesuit drama gradually developed into a means of instruction and indoctrination," and he speaks of their "spectacular Biblical pageants." BjurstrSm mainly discusses stage design, and he finds the same striving after illu- sory and dramatic effects which is charac- teristic of painting and sculpture in Ba- roque Rome and the same attempt to bring the Bible close to the believer. The essay by Thomas Culley of the Col- lege of the Holy Cross is entitled, "The German College: a Center for Baroque Music." He says that at least three Jesuit colleges were outstanding for their musi- cal instruction before the end of the six- teenth century but none had more far- reaching influence than Collegium Ger- manicum in Rome. The most gifted musi- cians were attracted to it, and its peripa- tetic students carried their skills to Ger- many, Austria, France, England, and Scandinavia. Culley points out that the movement was not completely one-way, for the college invited Flemish organ-mak- ers to Rome to build two very unusual and versatile organs-as he writes, "a gi- gantic step toward the Baroque organ that would later be fully realized." All of the essays are instructive and pro- vide a springboard for further study of this connection between Jesuit thinking and the arts, particularly now in the areas of painting and sculpture which were only lightly touched in this symposium. Could not the question, "Is there a tangible re- lationship between Jesuit writing and pictorial expression?" be profitably exam- ined? Some of us have pondered this in regard to St. Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises and Vanitas painting (e.g., Elizabeth Trapier in her Valdes Leal monograph), and recently Craig Felton has postulated the influence of the Spiritual Exercises on Ribera's early paintings (in the Bulletin of the Wadsworth Atheneum, Winter 1970). There are many other Jesuit au- thors to be considered such as the Spaniard Baltasar Gracian who wrote the fascinating allegory "El Criticon" among other books. (Also, it might be interesting to assess the subject from the other camp and investi- gate "The Pernicious (?)/Beneficial (?) Ef- fects of the Arts on Jesuit Thinking of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Cen- turies"!) The subject of the Jesuits and music might be further probed and possibly ex- panded to consider parallels between ex- pression in religious music and in Ba- roque art. The biography of St. Francis Borgia, third General of the Order, asserts that he liked music, and we see in Rome at this time a resurgence of musical inter- est with Palestrina's rise to prominence- from his Mass dedicated to the Pope through his subsequent appointments as choirmaster of the Julian chapel in St. Pe- ter's and later as director in St. Philip Neri's Oratory. Another dimension is the art and architecture of the Company of Je- sus in Latin America. At any rate, this com- pendium of essays lays the groundwork for further studies of the Jesuits vis-a-vis the arts which we hope will be equally il- luminating. ELEANOR M.

Any new book demands to be consid- ered from the standpoint of intended level of writing, and to what segment of the reading public it addresses itself. In this instance, and we are dealing for the time being with the first book under re- view, these particular aims are spelled out by the General Editor, who states in his Preface: "The Library of Art History . . . is designed for . . . educated laymen, up- per-class undergraduates and scholars in other fields ... " Consequently, we know that the vol- ume was not designed as a scholarly trea- tise but as a general introduction to a seg- ment of the field of Western Art History. As such, it remains to be seen whether the authors have fulfilled the task they set out to achieve, and whether the subdivision of material constitutes a reasonably coherent unit. We shall address ourselves to the latter question first, bearing in mind that the main responsibility for delimiting the var- ious constituent parts of the Library of Art History devolves upon the General Editor rather than the individual authors. It is perfectly correct to state, as does H. W. Janson, that one-volume Histories of Art are cumbersome and have the dis- advantage of being too restrictive as to text and illustration; and that they demand, accessorily, a wide range of competence from the author. We have pointed out to several publishers as long ago as the early 1950's, that a more detailed subdivision was desirable; and in fact, the Ullstein Kunstgeschichte can be considered as the most adequate and scholarly solution of the problem, together with the new Pro- pylden Kunstgeschichte, and the Pelican History of Art in the English language. Subdivisions of the entire context into a few volumes only remain in not con- spicuously lesser fashion inhibited with the main defects: cursory treatment, at- tempted coverage of wide and disparate areas of subject matter; and demand upon the authors to disperse their efforts. This book constitutes a good example of the latter treatment. While the same publishers brought out an exemplary vol- ume on the History of Italian Renais- sance Art, which, partly, because it en- compasses a unitary art historical period, has become a great achievement (the other part is due to the high competence of the author, Professor Frederick Hartt) -the Held-Posner volume deals with many divergent stylistic phases, facets and 474</page></plain_text>
