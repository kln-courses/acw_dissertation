The Whorfian Hypothesis Among recent developments in the anthropological sciences, hardly any have found so much attention and led to so much controversy as have the views ad- vanced by the late Benjamin Whorf. The hypothesis offered by Whorf is, "that the commonly held belief that the cognitive processes of all human beings possess a common logical structure which operates prior to and independently of communication through language, is erroneous. It is Whorf's view that the lin- guistic patterns themselves determine what the individual perceives in this world and how he thinks about it. Since these patterns vary widely, the modes of thinking and perceiving in groups utilizing different linguistic systems will result in basically different world views" (Fearing, 1954). "We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity which holds that all ob- servers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the uni- verse, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar.... We cut up and organize the spread and flow of events as we do largely because, through our mother tongue, we are parties to an agreement to do so, not because nature itself is segmented in exactly that way for all to see" (Whorf, 1952, p. 21) For example, in the Indo-European languages substantives, adjectives and verbs appear as basic grammatic units, a sentence being essentially a combina- tion of these parts. This scheme of a persisting entity separable from its proper- ties and active or passive behavior is fundamental for the categories of occidental thinking, from Aristotle's categories of "substance," "attributes" and "action" to the antithesis of matter and force, mass and energy in physics. Indian languages, such as Nootka (Vancouver Island) or Hopi, do not have parts of speech or separable subject and predicate. Rather they signify an event as a whole. When we say, "a light flashed" or "it (a dubious hypostatized entity) flashed", Hopi uses a single term, "flash (occurred)."1a la This and other examples in Whorf's argument are criticized by Whatmough (1955). "As Brugmann showed (Syntax des einfachen Satzes, 1925, pp. 17-24) fuiget, pluit, tonat are simply old ti-stems (nouns 'lightning there, rain there, thunder there,' and Whorf was quite wrong when he said that tonat (he used that very word) is structurally and logically un- paralleled in Hopi". Similarly, "the Hopi for 'prepare,' we are told, is 'to try-for, to practise- upon.' But this is exactly prae-paro". "It will not do to say that Hopi physics could not 243</page><page sequence="2">244 L. VON BERTALANFFY It would be important to apply the methods of mathematical logic to such languages. Can statements in languages like Nootka or Hopi be rendered by the usual logistic notation, or is the latter itself a formalization of the structure of Indo-European language? It appears that this important subject has not been investigated. Indo-European languages emphasize time. The "give-and-take" between language and culture leads, according to Whorf, to keeping of records, diaries, mathematics stimulated by accounting; to calendars, clocks, chronology, time as used in physics; to the historical attitude, interest in the past, archeology, etc. It is interesting to compare this with Spengler's conception of the central role of time in the occidental world picture (cf. p. 252), which, from a different view- point, comes to the identical conclusion. However, the, for us, self-evident distinction between past, present, and future does not exist in the Hopi language. It makes no distinction between tenses, but indicates the validity a statemeilt has: fact, memory, expectation, or custom. There is no difference in Hopi between "he runs", "he is running", "he ran", all being rendered by wari, "running occur". An expectation is rendered by warikni ("running occur [I] daresay"), which covers "he will, shall, should, would run". If, however, it is a statement of a general law, warikngwe ("running oc- cur, characteristically") is applied (La Barre, 1954, p. 197 ff.). The Hopi "has no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future, through a present, into a past" (Whorf, 1952, p. 67). Instead of our categories of space and time, Hopi rather distinguishes the "manifest", all that which is accessible to the senses, with no distinction between present and past, and the "unmanifest" comprising the future as well as what we call mental. Navaho (cf. Kluckhohn and Leighton, 1951) has little development of tenses; the emphasis is upon types of activity, and thus it distinguishes durative, perfective, usitative, repetitive, iterative, optative, semilfactive, momentaneous, progressive, transitional, conative, etc. aspects of action. The difference can be defined that the first con- cern of English (and Indo-European language in general) is time, of Hopi- validity, and of Navaho-type of activity (personal communication of Professor Kluckhohn). Wlhorf asks: "How would a physics constructed along these lines work, with no t (time) in its equations? Perfectly, as far as I can see, though of course it would require dif- ferent ideology and perhaps different mathematics. Of course, v (velocity) would have to go too" (1952, p. 7). have had concepts such as space, velocity, and mass, or that they would have been very different from ours. Hopi has no physics because the Hopi are hindered by taboo or magic from experimental investigation." Although one has to surrender to the linguist's authority, it seems amply demonstrated that the style of thinking is different in the several civiliza- tions even though Whorf's supposition that this is more or less solely due to linguistic factors, is open to criticism.</page><page sequence="3">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 245 Again it can be mentioned that a timeless physics actually exists, in the form of Greek statics (cf. p. 252). For us, it is part of a wider system, dynamics, for the particular case that t -* oo, i.e. time approaches the infinite and drops out of the equations. As regards to space, the Indo-European tongues widely express non-spatial relations by spatial metaphors: long, short for duration; heavy, light, high, low for intensity; approach, rise, fall for tendency; Latin expressions like educo, religio, comprehendo as metaphorical spatial (probably more correct: corporeal, L. v. B.) references: lead out, tying back, grasp, etc.' This is untrue of Hopi where rather physical things are named by psychological metaphors. Thus the Hopi word for "heart" can be shown to be a late formation from a root meaning think or remember. Hopi language is, as Whorf states, ca- pable of accounting for and describing correctly, in a pragmatical or observa- tional sense, all observable phenomena of the universe. However, the implicit metaphysics is entirely different, being rather a way of animistic or vitalistic thinking, near to the mystical experience of oneness. Thus, Whorf maintains, "Newtonian space, time and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language" (1952, p. 40). "Just as it is possible to have any number of geometries other than the Euclidean which give an equally perfect account of space configurations, so it is possible to have descriptions of the universe, all equally valid, that do not contain our familiar contrast of time and space. The relativity viewpoint of modern physics is one such view, conceived in mathematical terms, and the Hopi Weltanschauung is another and quite different one, non-mathematical and linguistic" (Whorf, 1952, p. 67) The ingrained mechanistic way of thinking which comes into difficulties with the modern scientific developments, is a consequence of our specific linguistic categories and habits, and Whorf hopes that insight into the diversity of linguistic systems may contribute to the re-evaluation of scientific concepts. 1 It is interesting to note that exactly the same viewpoint was stated by Lorenz (1943) in terms of the biological determination of categories: "The terms which language has formed for the highest functions of our rational thinking still bear so clearly the stamp of their origin that they might be taken from the 'professional language' of a chimpanzee. We 'win insight' into intricate connections, just as the ape into a maze of branches, we found no better expression for our most abstract ways to achieve goals than 'method', meaning detour. Our tactile space still has, as it were from the time of non-jumping lemurs, a particular preponderance over the visual. Hence we have 'grasped' (erfasst) a 'connec- tion' (Zusammenhang) only if we can 'comprehend' (begreifen, i.e. seize) it. Also the notion of object (Gegenstand, that which stands against us) originated in the haptic perception of space.. . . Even time is represented, for good or wrong, in terms of the visualizable model of space (p. 344)... . Time is absolutely unvisualizable and is, in our categorial thinking, made visualizable always (?; perhaps a Western prejudice, L.v.B.) only by way of spatio- temporal processes.. . . The 'course of time' is symbolized, linguistically and certainly also conceptually, by motion in space (the stream of time). Even our prepositions 'before' and 'after,' our nouns 'past, present and future' originally have connotations representing spatio-temporal configurations of motion. It is hardly possible to eliminate from them the element of motion in space" (p. 351 f.).</page><page sequence="4">246 L. VON BERTALANFFY La Barre (1954, p. 301) has vividly summarized this viewpoint: "Aristotelian Substance and Attribute look remarkably like Indo-European nouns and predicate adjectives. . . . More modern science may well raise the question whether Kant's Forms, or twin 'spectacles' of Time and Space (without which we can perceive nothing) are not on the one hand mere Indo-European verbal tense, and on the other hand human stereoscopy and kinaesthesis and life-process-which might be more economically expressed in terms of the c, or light-constant, of Ein- stein's formula. But we must remember all the time that E = Mc2 is also only a grammatical conception of reality in terms of Indo-European morphological cate- gories of speech. A Hopi, Chinese, or Eskimo Einstein might discover via his gram- matical habits wholly different mathematical conceptualizations with which to apperceive reality". This paper is not intended to discuss the linguistic problems posed by Whorf as was exhaustively done in a recent symposium (Hoijer et al., 1954). However, it has occurred to the present author that what is known as the Whorfian hypoth- esis is not an isolated statement of a somewhat extravagant individual. Rather the Whorfian hypothesis of the linguistic determination of the categories of cognition is part of a general revision of the cognitive process. It is embedded in a powerful current of modern thought, the sources of which can be found in philosophy as well as in biology. It seems that these connections are not realized to the extent they deserve. The general problem posed may be expressed as follows: In how far are the categories of our thinking modelled by and dependent on biological and cultural factors? It is obvious that, stated in this way, the problem far exceeds the borders of linguistics, and touches the question of the foundations of human knowledge. Such analysis will have to start with the classical, absolutistic world view which found its foremost expression in the Kantian system. According to the Kantian thesis, there are the so-called forms of intuition, space and time, and the cate- gories of the intellect such as substance, causality and others which are uni- versally committal for any rational being. Accordingly science, based upon these categories, is equally universal. Physical science using these apriori cate- gories, namely, Euclidean space, Newtonian time and strict deterministic causality, is essenitially classical mechanics which, therefore, is the absolute system of knowledge, applying to any phenomenon as well as to any mind as observer. It is a well-known fact that modern science has long recognized that this is not so. There is no need to belabor this point. Euclidean space is but one form of geometry beside which other, non-Euclidean geometries exist which have exactly the same logical structure and right to exist. Modern science applies whatever sort of space and time is most convenient and appropriate for describ- ing the events in nature. In the world of medium dimensions, Euclidean space and Newtonian time apply in the way of satisfactory approximations. However, coming to astronomical dimensions and, on the other hand, to atomic events, non-Euclidean spaces or the many-dimensional configuration spaces of quantum theory are introduced. In the theory of relativity, space and time fuse in the Minkowski union, where time is another co-ordinate of a four-dimensional con-</page><page sequence="5">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 247 tinuum, although of a somewhat peculiar character. Solid matter, this most ob- trusive part of experience and most trivial of the categories of naive physics, consists almost completely of holes, being a void for the greatest part, only inter- woven by centers of energy which, considering their magnitude, are separated by astronomical distances. Mass and energy, somewhat sophisticated quanti- fications of the categorical antithesis of stuff and force, appear as expressions of one unknown reality, interchangeable according to Einstein's law. Similarly, the strict determinism of classical physics is replaced in quantum physics by inde- terminism or rather by the insight that the laws of nature are essentially of a statistical character. Little is left of Kant's supposedly apriori and absolute categories. Incidentally, it is symptomatic of the relativity of world views that Kant who, in his epoch, appeared to be the great destroyer of all "dogmatism", to us appears a paradigm of unwarranted absolutism and dogmatism. So the question arises-what is it which determines the categories of human cognition? While, in the Kantian system, the categories appeared to be absolute for any rational observer, they now appear as changing with the advancement of scientific knowledge. In this sense, the absolutistic conception of earlier times and of classical physics is replaced by a scientific relativism. The argument of the present discussion may be defined as follows. The cate- gories of knowledge, of every-day knowledge as well as of scientific knowledge, which in the last resort is only a refinement of the former, depend, first, on bio- logical factors; second, on cultural factors; third, notwithstanding this all-too- human entanglement, absolute knowledge, emancipated from human limitations, is possible in a certain sense. 2. The Biological Relativity of Categories Cognition is dependent, firstly, on the psycho-physical organization of man. We may refer here in particular to that approach in modern biology which was inaugurated by Jacob von Uexkuill under the name of Umwelt-Lehre. It essen- tially amounts to the statement that, from the great cake of reality, every living organism cuts a slice, which it can perceive and to which it can react owing to its psycho-physical organization, that is, the structure of receptor and effector organs. Von Uexkiull and Kriszat have presented fascinating pictures how the same section of nature looks as seen by various animals; they should be com- pared to Whorf's equally amusing drawings which show how the world is modelled according to linguistic schemes. Here only a few examples, chosen from Uexkuill's extensive behavioral studies, can be mentioned. Take, for example, a unicellular organism like the paramecium. Its almost only way of response is the flight reaction (phobotaxis) by which it reacts to the most diverse, chemical, tactile, thermal, photic, etc. stimuli. This simple reac- tion, however, suffices safely to guide that animal which possesses no specific sense organs, into the region of optimal conditions. The many things in the environment of the paramecium, algae, other infusoria, little crustaceans, mechan- ical obstacles and the like, are non-existent for it. Only one stimulus is received which leads to the flight reaction.</page><page sequence="6">248 L. VON BERTALANFFY As this example shows, the organizational and functional plan of a living being determines what can become "stimulus" and "characteristic" to which the organism responds with a certain reaction. According to von Uexkuill's expres- sion, any organism, so to speak, cuts out from the multiplicity of surrounding objects a small number of characteristics to which it reacts and whose ensemble forms its "ambient" (Umwelt). All the rest is non-existent for that particular organism. Every animal is surrounded, as by a soap-bubble, by its specific am- bient, replenished by those characteristics which are amenable to it. If, recon- structing an animal's ambient, we enter this soap-bubble, the world is pro- foundly changed: Many characteristics disappear, others arise, and a completely new world is found. Von Uexktill has given innumerable examples delineating the ambients of various animals. Take, for instance, a tick lurking in the bushes for a passing mammal in whose skin it settles and drinks himself full of blood. The signal is the odor of butyric acid, flowing from the dermal glands of all mammals. Follow- ing this stimulus, it plunges down; if it fell on a warm body-as monitored by its sensitive thermal sense-it has reached its prey, a warm-blooded animal, and only needs to find, aided by tactile sense, a hair-free place to pierce in. Thus the rich environment of the tick shrinks to metamorphize into a scanty configura- tion out of which only three signals, beacon-like, are gleaming which, however, suffice to lead the animal surely to its goal. Or again, some sea urchins respond to any darkening by striking together their spines. This reaction invariably is applied against a passing cloud or boat, or the real enemy, an approaching fish. Thus, while the environment of the sea urchin contains many different objects, its ambient only contains one characteristic, namely, dimming of light. This organizational constraint of the ambient goes even much farther than the examples just mentioned indicate (Bertalanffy, 1937). It also concerns the forms of intuition, considered by Kant as apriori and immutable. The biologist finds that there is no absolute space or time but that they depend on the organiza- tion of the perceiving organism. Three-dimensional Euclidean space, where the three rectangular co-ordinates are equivalent, was always identified with the apriori space of experience and perception. But even simple contemplation shows, and experiments in this line (von Allesch, 1931; von Skramlik, 1934, and others) prove that the space of visual and tactual perception is in no way Euclidean. In the space of perception, the coordinates are in no way equivalent, but there is a fundamental difference between top and bottom, right and left, and fore and aft. Already the organization of our body and, in the last resort, the fact that the organism is subjected to gravity, makes for an inequality of the horizontal and vertical dimensions. This is readily shown by a simple fact known to every photographer. We experience it as quite correct that, according to the laws of perspective, parallels, such as railroad tracks, converge in the distance. Exactly the same perspective foreshortening is, however, experienced as being wrong if it appears in the vertical dimension. If a picture was taken with the camera tilted, we obtain "falling lines", the edges of a house, for example, running to- gether. This is, perspectively, just as correct as are the converging railroad tracks;</page><page sequence="7">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 249 nevertheless, the latter perspective is experienced as being all right, while the converging edges of a house are experienced as wrong; the explanation being that the human organism is such as to have an ambient with considerable horizontal, but negligible vertical extension.2 A similar relativity is found in experienced time. Von Uexkuill has introduced the notion of the "instant" as the smallest unit of perceived time. For man, the instant is about 118 sec., that is impressions shorter than this duration are not perceived separately but fuse. It appears that the duration of the instant de- pends not on conditions in the sense organs but rather in the central nervous system for it is the same for different sense organs. This flicker fusion is, of course, the raison d'etre of movie pictures when frames presented in a sequence faster than 18 per second fuse into continuous motion. The duration of the instant varies in different species. There are "slow motion-picture animals" (von Uex- kuill) which perceive a greater number of impressions per second than man. Thus, the fighting fish (Betta) does not recognize its image in a mirror if, by a mechanical device, it is presented 18 times per second. It has to be presented at least 30 times per second; then the fish attacks his imaginary opponent. Hence, these small and very active animals consume a larger number of impressions than man does, per unit of astronomical time; time is decelerated. Conversely, a snail is a "rapid motion-picture animal". It crawls on a vibrating stick if it ap- proaches four times per second, that is, a stick vibrating four times per second appears at rest to the snail. Experienced time is not Newtonian. Far from flowing uniformly (aequilabiliter fluit, as Newton has it), it depends on physiological conditions. The so-called time memory of animals and man seems to be determined by a "physiological clock". Thus bees, conditioned to appear at a certain time at the feeding place, will show up earlier or later if drugs which increase or decrease the rate of me- tabolism, are administred (for example, von Stein-Beling, 1935; Kalmus, 1934; Wahl 1932; and others). Experienced time seems to fly if it is filled with impressions, and creeps if we are in a state of tedium. In fever, when body temperature and metabolic rate are increased, time seems to linger since the number of "instants"' per astronomical unit in Uexkuill's sense is increased. This time experience is paralleled by a corresponding increase of the frequency of the a-waves in the brain (Hoagland, 1951). With increasing age, time appears to run faster, i.e. a smaller number of instants is experienced per astronomical unit of time. Correspondingly, the rate of cicatrization of wounds is decreased proportional to age, the psychological as well as physiological phenomena obviously being connected with the slowing- down of metabolic processes in senescence (du Nouiy, 1937). Several attempts (Brody, 1937; Backman, 1940; Bertalanffy, 1951, p. 346) have been made to establish a biological as compared to astronomical time. One means 2 As far as can be seen, this simple demonstration of the non-Euclidean structure of the visual space was first indicated by BertalanfFy (1937, p. 155), while "curious enough, no reference whatever is found in the literature on the physiology of perception" (Lorenz, 1943, p. 335).</page><page sequence="8">250 L. VON BERTALANFFY is the homologization of growth curves: If the course of growth in different ani- mals is expressed by the same formula and curve, the units of the time scale (plotted in astronomical time) will be different and important physiological changes presumably will appear at corresponding points of the curve. From the standpoint of physics, a thermodynamic time, based upon the second prin- ciple and irreversible processes, can be introduced as opposed to astronomical time (Prigogine, 1947). Thermodynamic time is non-linear but logarithmic since it depends on probabilities; it is, for the same reason, statistical; and it is local because determined by the events at a certain point. Probably biological time bears an intimate although by no means simple relation to thermodynamic time. How the categories of experience depend on physiological states, is also shown by the action of drugs. Under the influence of mescaline, for example, visual impressions are intensified, and the perception of space and time undergoes pro- found changes (cf. Anschtitz, 1953; A. Huxley, 1954). It would make a most in- teresting study to investigate the categories of schizophrenics, and it would prob- ably be found that they differ considerably from those of "normal" experience, as do indeed the categories in the experience of dreams. Even the most fundamental category of experience, namely, the distinction of ego and non-ego, is not absolutely fixed. It seems gradually to evolve in the de- velopment of the child (cf. Bertalanffy and Deutsch, 1954). It is essentially different in the animistic thinking of the primitives (still in force even in the Aris- totelian theory where every thing "seeks" its natural place), and in Western think- ing since the Renaissance which "has discovered the inanimate" (Schaxel, 1923). The object-subject separation again disappears in the empathic world-view of the poet, in mystical ecstasy and in states of intoxication. There is no intrinsic justification to consider as "true" representation of the world what we take to be "normal" experience (that is, the experience of the average adult European of the 20th century), and to consider all other sorts of experience that are equally vivid, as merely abnormal, fantastic or, at the best, as a primitive precursor of our "scientific" world picture. The discussion of these problems could easily be enlarged, but the point im- portant for the present topic will have become clear. The categories of experience or forms of intuition, to use Kant's term, are not a universal apriori, but rather they depend on the psycho-physical organization and physiological conditions of the experiencing animal, man included. This relativism from the biological standpoint is an interesting parallel to the relativism of categories as viewed from the standpoint of culture and language. 3. The Cultural Relativity of Categories We now come to the second point, the dependence of categories on cultural factors. As already mentioned, the Whorfian thesis of the dependence of cate- gories on linguistic factors is part of a general conception of cultural relativism which has developed in the past 50 years; although even this is not quite correct, since Wilhelm von Humboldt has already emphasized the dependence of our world perspective on linguistic factors and the structure of language.</page><page sequence="9">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 251 It appears that this development started in the history of art. At the beginning of this century, the Viennese art-historian, Riegl, published a very learned and tedious treatise on late-Roman artcraft. He introduced the concept of Kunst- wollen, a term which may be translated as "artistic intention". The unnaturalistic character of primitive art was conceived to be a consequence not of a lack of skill or know-how, but rather the expression of an artistic intention which is different from ours, being not interested in a realistic reproduction of nature. The same applies to the so-called degeneration of classic art in the late Hellenistic period. This conception later was expanded by Worringer who demonstrated in the ex- ample of Gothic art that artistic modes diametrically opposed to the classical canon, are an outcome not of technical impotence, but rather of a different world view. It was not that Gothic sculptors and painters didn't know how to represent nature correctly, but their intention was different and not directed towards representative art. The connection of these theories with the primitivism and expressionism in modern art needs no discussion. I wish to offer another example of the same phenomenon which is instructive since it has nothing to do with the antithesis of representative and expressionistic, objective and abstract art. It is found in the history of Japanese woodcut. Japanese pictures of the later period apply a certain kind of perspective, known as parallel perspective, which is different from central perspective as used in European art since the Renaissance. It is well-known that Dutch treatises on perspective were introduced into Japan in the late 18th century, and were eagerly studied by the Ukiyoye (woodcut) masters. They adopted perspective as a powerful means to represent nature, but only to a rather subtle limit. While European painting uses central perspective where the picture is conceived from a focal point and consequently parallels converge in the distance, the Japanese only accepted parallel perspective; that is, a way of projection where the focal point is in the infinite, and hence parallels do not converge. We may be sure that this was not lack of skill in those eminent Japanese artists who, like Hokusai and Hiroshige, later exerted a profound influence on modern European art. They certainly would have found no difficulty to adopt an artistic means which even was handed to them ready-made. Rather we may conjecture that they felt central perspective, dependent on the standpoint of the observer, to be con- tingent and accidental and not representing reality since it changes as the ob- server moves from one place to another. In a similar way, the Japanese artists never painted shadows. This, of course, does not mean that they did not see it or not go into the shade when the sun was burning. However, they did not wish to paint it; for the shadow does not belong to the reality of things but is only changing appearance. So the categories of artistic creation seem to be dependent on the culture in question. It is well-known that Spengler has expanded this thesis to include cog- nitive categories. According to him, the so-called apriori contains, besides a small number of universally human and logically necessary forms of thinking, also forms of thinking that are universal and necessary not for humanity as a whole, but olnly for the particular civilization in question. So there are various and dif-</page><page sequence="10">252 L. VON BERTALANFFY ferent "styles of cognition", characteristic of certain groups of human beings. Spengler does not deny the universal validity of the formal laws of logic or of the empirical verites de fait. He contends, however, the relativity of the contentual aprioris in science and philosophy. It is in this sense that Spengler states the relativity of mathematics and mathematical science. The mathematical formulae as such carry logical necessity; but their visualizible interpretation which gives them meaning is an expression of the "soul" of the civilization which has created them. In this way, our scientific world picture is only of relative validity. Its fundamental concepts, such as the infinite space, force, energy, motion, etc. are an expression of our occidental type of mind, and do not hold for the world pic- ture of other civilizations. The analysis upon which Spengler's cultural relativism of the categories is mainly based, is his famous antithesis of Apollonian and Faustian man. According to him, the primeval symbol of the Apollonian mind of antiquity is the material and bodily existence of individuals; that of the Faustian mind of the occident is infinite space. Thus "space", for the Greeks, is the ,ud ov, that which is not. Con- sequently, Apollonian mathematics is a theory of visualizable magnitudes, culminating in stereometry and geometric construction which, in occidental mathematics, is a rather unconsequential elementary topic. Occidental mathe- matics, governed by the primeval symbol of the infinite space, in contrast, is a theory of pure relations, culminating in differential calculus, the geometry of many-dimensional spaces, etc., which, in their unvisualizability, would have been completely inconceivable to the Greeks. A second antithesis is that of the static character of Greek, and the dynamic character of occidental thought. Thus, for the Greek physicist, an atom was a miniature plastic body; for occidental physics, it is a center of energy, radiating actions into an infinite space. Connected with this is the mealling of time. Greek physics did not contain a time dimension, and this is at the basis of its being a statics. Occidental physics is deeply concerned with the time course of events, the notion of entropy being probably the deepest conception in the system. From the concern with time further follows the historical orientation of the oc- cidental mind expressed in the dominating influence of the clock, in the biography of the individual, in the enormous perspective of "world history" from histori- ography to cultural history to anthropology, biological evolution, geological history, and finally astronomical history of the universe. Again, the same con- trast is manifest in the conception of the mind. Static Greek psychology imagines a harmonic soul-body whose "parts", according to Plato, are reason (Xo-yto--LK6'), emotion (6v1ioEacs), and cathexis (eirtL&amp;vMrW6J'). Dynamic occidental psychol- ogy imagines a soul-space where psychological forces are interacting. Taking exception from Spengler's metaphysics and intuitive method, and dis- regarding questionable details, it will be difficult to deny that his conception of the cultural relativity of categories is essentially correct. It suffices to remember the first lines of the Iliad, telling of the heros of the Trojan war acrobs -rc CXcMpt. -rEXfE KiwfELOcaTa,0 that their selves were given a prey to the hounds and birds, the "self" being essentially the body or acoAa. Compare this with Descartes' cogito ergo sum-and the contrast between Apollonian and Faustian mind is obvious.</page><page sequence="11">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 253 While the German philosophers of history were concerned with the small number of high cultures (Hochkulturen), it is the hallmark and merit of modern and, in particular, American anthropology to take into account the entire field of human "cultures" including the multiplicity exhibited by primitive peoples. So the theory of cultural relativism wins a broader basis but it is remark- able that the conclusions reached are very similar to those of the German philoso- phers. In particular, the Whorfian thesis is essentially identical with the Spengler- ian-the one based upon the linguistics of primitive tribes, the other on a general view of the few high cultures of history.3 So it appears well established that the categories of cognition depend, first, on biological factors, and secondly, on cultural factors. A suitable formulation per- haps can be given in the following way. Our perception is essentially determined by our specifically human, psycho- physical organization. This is essentially von Uexkuill's thesis. Linguistic, and cultural categories in general, will not change the potentialities of sensory ex- perience. They will, however, change apperception, that is, which features of experienced reality are focussed and emphasized, and which are under-played. There is nothing mysterious or particularly paradoxical in this statement which, in the contrary, is rather trivial; nothing which would justify the heat and passion which has often characterized the dispute on the Whorfian, Speng- lerian, and similar theses. Suppose a histological preparation is studied under the microscope. Any observer, if he is not color-blind, will perceive the same pic- ture, various shapes and colors, etc. as given by the application of histological stains. However, what he actually sees, that is, what is his apperception (and what he is able to communicate), depends widely on whether he is untrained or a trained observer. Where for the layman there is only a chaos of shapes and colors, the histologist sees cells with their various components, different tissues, and signs of malignant growth. And even this depends on his line of interest and training. A cytochemist will possibly notice fine granulations in the cytoplasm of cells which represent to him certain chemically defined inclusions; the pathol- ogist may, instead, entirely ignore these niceties, and rather "see" how a tumor has infiltrated the organ. Thus what is seen depends on our apperception, on our line of attention and interest which, in turn, is determined by training, that is, by linguistic symbols by which we represent and summarize reality. It is equally trivial that the same object is something quite different if envis- aged from different viewpoints. The same table is to the physicist an aggregate of electrons, protons, and neutrons, to the chemist a composition of certain or- ganic compounds, to the biologist a complex of wood cells, the art historian a baroque object, the economist a utility of certain money value, etc. All these perspectives are of equal status, and none can claim more absolute value than the other (cf. Bertalanffy, 1953). Or, to take a slightly less trivial example. Organic forms can be considered from different viewpoints. Typology considers them as the expression of different plans of organization; the theory of evolution 3 An excellent analysis on the culture-dependence of perception, cognition, affect, evalua- tion, unconscious processes, normal and abnormal behavior, etc., is given in Kluckhohn (1954).

VON B:ERTALANFFY as a product of a historical process; a dynamic morphology as expression of a play of processes and forces for which mathematical laws are sought (Bertalanffy, 1941). Each of these viewpoints is perfectly legitimate, and there is little point to play one against the other. What is obvious in these special examples equally holds for what traits of reality are noticed in our general world picture. It is an important trend of the development of science that new aspects, previously unnoticed, are "seen", that is, come under the focus of attention and apperception; and conversely, an important obstacle that the goggles of a certain theoretical conception do not allow to realize phenomena which, in themselves, are perfectly obvious. History of science is rich in examples of such kind. For instance, the theoretical spec- tacles of a onie-sided "cellular pathology" simply did not allow to see that there are regulative relations in the organism as a whole which is more than a sum or aggregate of cells; relations which were known to Hippocrates and have found a happy resurrection in the modern doctrine of hormones, of somatotypes and the like. The modern evolutionist, guided by the theory of random mutation and selection, does not see that an organism is obviously more than a heap of hereditary characteristics or genes shuffled together by accident. The mechanistic physicist did not see the so-called "secondary qualities" like color, sound, taste, etc. because they do not fit into his scheme of abstractions; although they are just as "real" as are the supposedly basic "primary qualities" of mass, impene- trability, motion and the like the metaphysical status of which is equally dubi- ous, according to the testimony of modern physics. Another possible formulation of the same situation, but emphasizing another aspect, is this. Perception is universally human, determined by man's psycho- physical equipment. Conceptualization is culture-bound because it depends on the symbolic systems we apply. These symbolic systems are largely determined by linguistic factors, the structure of the language applied. Technical language, including the symbolism of mathematics, is, in the last resort, an efflorescence of every-day language, and so will not be independent of the structure of the latter. This, of course, does not mean that the content of mathematics is "true" only within a certain culture. It is a tautological system of hypothetico- deductive nature, and hence any rational being accepting the premises must agree to all its deductions. But which aspects or perspectives are mathematized depends on the cultural context. It is perfectly possible that different individuals and cultures have different predilections for choosing certain aspects and neglect- ing others.4 Hence, for example, the Greek's concern with geometrical problems and the concern of occidental mathematics with calculus, as emphasized by Spengler; hence the appearance of unorthodox fields of mathematics such as 4I find that Toynbee (1954, p. 699 ff.), in his otherwise not overly friendly comment on Spengler's theory of types of mathematical thinking, arrives at an identical formulation. He speaks of a different "penchant" of civilizations for certain types of mathematical reasoning, which is the same as the above-used notion of "predilection". The present writer's interpretation of Spengler was, in the essentials, given in 1924, and he has seen no reason to change it.</page><page sequence="13">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 255 topology, group theory, game theory and the like which do not fit into the popular notion of mathematics as a "science of quantities"; hence the individual physicist's predilection for, say, "macroscopic" classical thermodynamics or "microscopic" molecular statistics, for matrix mechanics or wave mechanics to approach the same phenomena. Or, speaking more generally, the analytic type of mind concerned with what is called "molecular" interpretations, i.e. the resolution and reduction of phenomena to elementaristic components; and the holistic type of mind concerned with "molar" interpretations, i.e. interested in the laws that govern the phenomenon as a whole. Much harm has been done in science by playing one aspect against the other and so, in the elementaristic ap- proach, to neglect and deny obvious and most important characteristics; or, in the holistic approach, to deny the fundamental importance and necessity of analysis. It may be mentioned, in passing, that the relation between language and world view is not unidirectional but reciprocal, a fact which perhaps was not made sufficiently clear by Whorf. The structure of language seems to determine which traits of reality are abstracted and hence what form the categories of thinking take on. On the other hand, the world outlook determines and forms the language. A good example is the evolution from classical to medieval Latin. The Gothic world view has re-created an ancient language, this being true for the lexical as well as the grammatical aspect. Thus, the scholastics invented hosts of words which are atrocities from the standpoint of Cicero's language (as the humanists of the Renaissance so deeply felt in their revivalistic struggle); words introduced to cope with abstract aspects foreign to the corporeally-thinking Roman mind, like leonitas, quidditas and the rest of them. Equally, although the superficial rules of grammar were observed, the line of thinking and construction was pro- foundly altered. This also applies to the rhetorical aspect, as in the introduction of the end-rhyme in contrast to the classical meters. Comparison, say, of the colos- sal lines of the Dies irae with some Virgilian or Horacian stanza makes obvious not only the tremendous gap between different "world-feelings" but the de- termination of language by the latter as well. 4. The Perspectivistic View Having indicated the biological and cultural relativity of the categories of experience and cognition, we can, on the other hand, also indicate the limits of this relativity, and thus come to the third topic stated in the beginning. Relativism has often been formulated to express the purely conventional and utilitarian character of knowledge, and with the emotional background of its ulti- mate futility. We can, however, easily see that such consequence is not implied. A suitable starting point for such discussion is the views on human knowledge expressed by von Uexkuill in connection with his Umweltlehre we have dis- cussed earlier. According to him, the world of human experience and knowledge is one of the innumerable ambients of the organisms, in no way singular as compared to that of the sea urchin, the fly or the dog. Even the world of</page><page sequence="14">256 L. VON BERTALANFFY physics, from the electrons and atoms up to galaxies, is a merely human product, dependent upon the psycho-physical organization of the human species. Such conception, however, appears to be incorrect. This may be shown in view of the levels both of experience and of abstract thinking, of every-day life and of science. As far as direct experience is concerned, the categories of perception as deter- mined by the bio-physiological organization of the species concerned, cannot be completely "wrong", fortuitous and arbitrary. Rather they must, in a certain way and to a certain extent, correspond to "reality"-whatever this means in a metaphysical sense. Any organism, man included, is not a mere spectator, looking at the world scene and hence free to adopt spectacles, however distorting, as the whims of God, of biological evolution, of the "soul" of culture, or of language have put on his metaphorical nose. Rather he is a reactor and actor in the drama. The organism has to react to stimuli coming from outside, according to its innate psycho-physical equipment. There is a latitude in what is picked as a stimulus, signal and characteristic in Uexkulll's sense. However, his perception must allow the animal to find its way in the world. This would be impossible if the categories of experience, such as space, time, substance, causality, were entirely deceptive. The categories of experience have arisen in biological evolu- tion, and have continually to justify themselves in the struggle for existence. If they would not, in some way, correspond to reality, appropriate reaction would be impossible, and such organism would quickly be eliminated by selection. Speaking in anthropomorphic terms: A group of schizophrenics who share their illusions, may get along with each other pretty well; they are, however, utterly unfit to react and adapt themselves to real outside situations, and this is precisely the reason why they are put into the asylum. Or, in terms of Plato's simile: the prisoners in the cave do not see the real things but only their shadows; but if they are not only looking at the spectacle, but have to take part in the per- formance, the shadows must, in some way, be representative of the real things. It seems to be the most serious shortcoming of classic occidental philosophy, from Plato to Descartes and Kant, to consider man primarily as a spectator, as ens cogitans, while, for biological reasons, he has essentially to be a performer, an ens agens in the world he is thrown in. Lorenz (1943) has convincingly shown that the "a priori" forms of experience are of essentially the same nature as the innate schemata of instinctive behavior, following which animals respond to companions, sexual partners, offspring or parents, prey or predators, and other outside situations. They are based upon psy- chophysiological mechanisms, such as the perception of space is based on binoc- ular vision, parallaxis, the contraction of the ciliary muscle, apparent increase or decrease in size of an approaching or receding object, etc. The "a priori" forms of intuition and categories are organic functions, based upon corporeal and even machine-like structures of the sense organs and the nervous system, which have evolved as adaptations in the millions of years of evolution. Hence they are fitted to the "real" world in exactly the same way and for the same reason, as the equine hoof is fitted to the steppe terrain, the fin of the fish to the water. It is a</page><page sequence="15">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 257 preposterous anthropomorphism to assume that the human forms of experience are the only possible ones, valid for any rational being. On the other hand, the conception of the forms of experience as an adaptive apparatus proved in millions of years of struggle for existence, guarantees that there is a sufficient corres- pondence between "appearance" and "reality". Any stimulus is experienced not as it is but as the organism reacts to it, and thus the world-picture is determined by psychophysical organization. However, where a paramecium reacts with its phobotactic reaction, also the human observer, though his world outlook is quite different, actually finds an obstacle when he uses his microscope. Similarly, it is well possible to indicate which traces of experience correspond to reality, and which, comparable to the coloured fringes in the field of a microscope which is not achromatically corrected, do not. So Pilate's question, what is truth, is to be answered thus: Already the fact that animals and human beings are still in existence, proves that their forms of experience correspond, to some degree, with reality. In view of this, it is possible to define what is meant with the intentionally loose expression used above, that experience must correspond "in a certain way" to "reality whatever this means." It is not required that the categories of ex- perience fully correspond to the real universe, and even less that they represent it completely. It suffices-and this is Uexkuill's thesis-that a rather small selec- tion of stimuli is used as guiding signals. As for the connections of these stimuli, i.e. the categories of experience, they need not mirror the nexus of real events but must, with a certain tolerance allowed, be isomorphic to it. For the biological reasons mentioned above, experience cannot be completely "wrong" and arbi- trary; but, on the other hand, it is sufficient that a certain degree of isomorphism exists between the experienced world and the "real" world, so that experience can guide the organism in such way as to preserve its existence. Again to use a simile: The "red" sign is not identical with the various hazards it indicates, oncoming cars, trains, crossing pedestrians, etc. It suffices, however, to indicate them, and thus "red" is isomorphic to "stop", "green" isomorphic to "go". Similarly, perception and experienced categories need not mirror the "real" world; they must, however, be isomorphic to it to such degree as to allow orien- tation and thus survival. But these deductive requirements are precisely what we actually find. The popular forms of intuition and categories, such as space, time, matter, and causality, work well enough in the world of "medium dimensions" to which the human animal is biologically adapted. Here, Newtonian mechanics and classical physics, as based upon these visualizable categories, are perfectly satisfactory. They break down, however, if we enter universes to which the human organism is not adapted. This is the case, on the one hand, in atomic dimensions, and in cosmic dimensions on the other. Coming now to the world of science, Uexkill's conception of the physical universe as but one of the innumerable biological ambients, is incorrect or at least incomplete. Here a most remarkable trend comes in which may be called the</page><page sequence="16">258 L. VON BERTALANFFY progressive de-anthropomorphization of science (Bertalanffy, 1937, 1953). It appears that this process of de-anthropomorphization takes place in three major lines. It is an essential characteristic of science that it progressively de-anthropo- morphizes, that is, progressively eliminates those traits which are due to specif- ically human experience. Physics necessarily starts with the sensory experience of the eye, the ear, the thermal sense, etc., and thus builds up fields like optics, acoustics, theory of heat, which correspond to the realms of sensory experience. Soon, however, these fields fuse into such that do not have any more relation to the "visualizable" or "intuitable": Optics and electricity fuse into electromag- netic theory, mechanics and theory of heat into statistical thermodynamics, etc. This evolution is connected with the invention of artificial sense-organs and the replacement of the human observer by the recording instrument. Physics, though starting with every-day experience, soon transgresses it by expanding the universe of experience through artificial sense-organs. Thus, for example, instead of seeing only visible light with a wave length between 380 and 760 millimicra, the whole range of electromagnetic radiation, from shortest cosmic rays up to radio waves of some kilometers wave length, is disclosed. Thus it is one function of science to expand the observable. It is to be empha- sized that, in contrast to a mechanistic view, we do not enter another metaphysi- cal realm with this expansion. Rather the things surrounding us in every-day experience, the cells seen in a microscope, the large molecules observed by the electron microscope, and the elementary particles "seen", in a still more indirect and intricate way, by their traces in a Wilson chamber, are not of a different degree of reality. It is a mechanistic superstition to believe that atoms and molecules (speaking with Alice in the Wonderland of Physics) are "realler" than apples, stones and tables. The ultimate particles of physics are not a meta- physical reality behind observation; they are an expansion of what we observe with our natural senses, by way of introducing suitable artificial sense organs. In any way, however, this leads to an elimination of the limitations of experi- ence as imposed by the specifically human psychophysical organization, and, in this sense, to the de-anthropomorphization of the world picture. A second aspect of this development is what is called the convergence of research (cf. Bavink, 1949). The constants of physics have often been considered as only conventional means for the most economic description of nature. The progress of research, however, shows a different picture. First, natural constants such as the mechanical equivalent of heat or the charge of electrons, vary widely in the observation of individual observers. Then, with the refinement of tech- niques, a "true" value is approached asymptotically so that consecutive deter- minations alter the established value only in progressively smaller digits of decimals. Not only this: Physical constants such as Loschmidt's number and its like, are established not by one method but perhaps by twenty methods which are com- pletely independent of each other. In this way, they cannot be conceived as being simply conventions for describing phenomena economically; they represent certain aspects of reality, independent of biological, theoretical or cultural biases.</page><page sequence="17">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 259 It is indeed one of the most important occupations of natural science thus to verify its findings in mutually independent ways. However, perhaps the most impressive aspect of progressive de-anthropomor- phization is the third. First, the so-called secondary qualities go, that is, color, sound, smell, taste disappear from the physical world picture since they are determined by the so-called specific energy of the diverse and specifically human senses. So, in the world picture of classical physics, only the primary qualities such as mass, impenetrability, extension, etc. are left which, psychophysically, are characterized as being the common ground of visual, tactual, acoustical experience. Then, however, these forms of intuition and categories also are eliminated as being all-too-human. Even Euclidean space and Newtonian time of classical physics, as was noted previously, are not identical with the space and time of direct experience; they already are constructs of physics. This, of course, is true even more of the theoretical structure of modern physics. Thus, what is specific of our human experience, is progressively eliminated. What eventually remains, is only a system of mathematical relations. Sometime ago it was considered a grave objection against the theory of rela- tivity and quantum theory that it became increasingly "unvisualizable", that its constructs cannot be represented by imaginable models. In truth, however, this is a proof that the system of physics detaches itself from the bondage of our specifically human sensory experience; a pledge that the system of physics in its consummate form-leaving it undecided whether this is attained or even is attainable at all-does not belong to the human ambient (umwelt in Uexkuill's sense) any more but it universally committal. In a way, progressive de-anthropomorphization is like Muenchhausen pulling himself out of the quagmire on his own pigtail. It is, however, possible because of a unique property of symbolism. A symbolic system, an algorithm, such as that of mathematics and mathematical physics, wins a life of its own as it were. It becomes a thinking machine, and once the proper instructions are fed in, the machine runs by itself, yie]ding unexpected results that surpass the initial amount of facts and given rules, and are thus unforeseeable by the limited intel- lect who originally has created the machine. In this sense, the mechanical chess player can outplay its maker (Ashby, 1952), that is, the results of the automa- tized symbolism transcend the original input of facts and instructions. This is the case in any algorithmic prediction, be it a formal deduction on any level of mathematical difficulty or a physical prediction like that of still unknown chem- ical elements or planets (cf. Bertalanify, in press). Progressive de-anthropomor- phization, that is, replacement of direct experience by a self-running algorithmic system, is one aspect of this state of affairs. Thus, the development of physics naturally depends on the psychophysical constitution of its creators. If man would not perceive light but radium or x-rays which are invisible to us, not only the human ambient but also the development of physics would be absolutely different. But in a similar way as we have discov- ered, by means of suitable apparatus and supplementing our sensory experience, x-rays and all the range of electromagnetic radiations, the same would be true of</page><page sequence="18">260 L. VON BERTALANFFY beings with an entirely different psychophysical constitution. Suppose there are intelligent beings or "angels" on a planet of the Sirius who perceive only x-rays; they would have detected, in a corresponding way, those wave lengths that mean visible light to us. But not only this: The Sirius angels would possibly calculate in quite different systems of symbols and theories. However, since the system of physics, in its consummate state, does not contain anything human any more, and the corresponding thing would be true of any system of physics, we must conclude that those physics, although different in their symbolic system, have the same content, that is, the mathematical relations of one physics could be translated by means of a suitable "vocabulary" and "grammar" into those of the other. This speculation is not quite utopian, but, to a certain extent, seen in the actual development of physics. Thus, classical thermodynamics and molecular statistics are different "languages" using different abstractions and mathematical symbol- isms, but the statements of one theory can readily be translated into the other. This even has quite timely implications; thermodynamics and the modern theory of information obviously are similarly isomorphic systems, and the elaboration of a complete "vocabulary" for translation is in progress. If, in the sense just indicated, the system of physics in its ideal state which can be approached only asymptotically, is absolute, we must, however, not forget another and in some way antithetical aspect. What traits of reality we grasp in our theoretical system is arbitrary in the epistemological sense, and determined by biological, cultural and probably linguistic factors. This, again, has first a trivial meaning. The Eskimos are said to have some thirty different names for "snow", doubtless because it is vitally important for them to make fine distinctions while, for us, these differences are negligible. Con- versely, we call machines which are only superficially different, by the names of Fords, Cadillacs, Pontiacs and so forth, while for the Eskimos they would be pretty much the same. The same, however, is true in a non-trivial sense, applying to general categories of thinking. It would be perfectly possible that rational beings of another structure choose quite different traits and aspects of reality for building theoretical systems, systems of mathematics and physics. Our main concern, probably determined by the grammatics of Indo-European language, is with measureable qualities, isolable units, and the like. Our physics neglects the so-called primary qualities; they come in only rudimentarily in the system of physics or in certain abstrac- tions of physiological optics like the color cycle or triangle.5 Similarly, our way of thinking is conspicuously unfit for dealing with problems of wholeness and 5 This perhaps can lead to a fairer interpretation of Goethe's "Theory of Colors". Goethe's revolt against Newtonian optics which is a scandal and completely devious within the history of occidental physics, can be understood in this way: Goethe, an eminently eidetic and intuitive mind, had the feeling (which is quite correct) that Newtonian optics purposely neglects, and abstracts from, exactly those qualities which are most prominent in sensory experience. His Farbenlehre, then, is an attempt to deal with those aspects of reality which are not covered by conventional physics; a theoretical enterprise which re- mained abortive.</page><page sequence="19">THE RELATIVITY OF CATEGORIES 261 form. Therefore, it is only with the greatest effort that holistic as contrasted to elementalistic traits can be included-although they are not less "real". The way of thinking of occidental physics leaves us on the spot if we are confronted with problems of form-hence this aspect, predominant in things biological, is but a tremendous embarrassment to physics. It may well be that quite different forms of science, of mathematics in the sense of hypothetico-deductive systems, are possible for beings who don't carry our biological and linguistic constraints; mathematical "physics" that are much more fit than ours to deal with such aspects of reality. The same seems even to be true of mathematical logic. So far, it seems to cover only a relatively small segment of what can easily be expressed in vernacular or mathematical language. The Aristotelian logic, for millenia considered as giving the general and supreme laws of reasoning, actually covers only the extremely small field of subject-predicate relations. The all-or-none concepts of traditional logic fall short of continuity concepts basic for mathematical analysis (cf. von Neumann, 1951, p. 16). Probably it is only a very small field of possible deductive reasoning which is axiomatized even by the efforts of modern logicians. It may be that the structure of our logic is essentially determined by the structure of our central nervous system. The latter is essentially a digital com- puter, since the neurons work according to the all-or-nothing law of physiology in terms of yes-or-no decisions. To this corresponds the Heraclitean principle of our thinking in opposites, our bivalent yes-or-no logic, Boolean algebra, and the binary system of numbers6 to which also the practically more convenient decadic system can be reduced (and is actually reduced in modern calculating machines). Supposing that a nervous system were constructed not after the digital type but as an analogy computer (such as, e.g., a slide rule), it may be imagined that a quite different logic of continuity, in contrast to our yes-or-no logic, would arise. Thus we come to a view which may be called perspectivism (cf. Bertalanffy, 1953). In contrast to the "reductionist" thesis that physical theory is the only one to which all possible science and all aspects of reality eventually should be reduced, we take a more modest view. The system of physics is committal for any rational being in the sense explained; that is, by a process of de-anthropomor- phization it approaches a representation of certain relational aspects of reality. It is essentially a symbolic algorithm suitable for the purpose. However, the choice of the symbolisms we apply and consequently the aspects of reality we represent, depend on biological and cultural factors. There is nothing singular or particularly sacred about the system of physics. Within our own science, other symbolic systems, such as those of taxonomy, of genetics or the history of art, are equally legitimate although they are far from having the same degree of precision. And in other cultures of human beings and among non-human intel- 6 Notice the theological motive in Leibniz's invention of the binary system. It repre- sented Creation since any number can be produced by a combination of "something" (1) and "nothing"' (0).

VON BERTALANFFY ligences, basically different kinds of "science" may be possible which would represent other aspects of reality as well or even better than does our so-called scientific world picture. There is, perhaps, a deep-lying reason why our mental representation of the universe always mirrors only certain aspects or perspectives of reality. Our thinking, at least in occidental but possibly in any human language, is essentially in terms of opposites. As Heraclitus has it, we are thinking in terms of warm and cold, black and white, day and night, life and death, being and becoming. These are naive formulations. But it appears that also the constructs of physics are such opposites, and that for this very reason prove inadequate in view of reality certain relations of which are expressed in the formulas of theoretical physics. The popular antithesis between motion and rest becomes meaningless in the theory of relativity. The antithesis of mass and energy is superseded by Einstein's conservation law which accounts for their mutual transformation. Corpuscle and wave are both legitimate and complementary aspects of physical reality which, in certain phenomena and respects, is to be described in one way, in others in the second. The contrast between structure and process breaks down in the atom as well as in the living organism whose structure is at the same time the expression and the bearer of a continuous flow of matter and energy. Perhaps the age-old problem of body and mind is of a similar nature, these being different aspects, wrongly hypostatized, of one and the same reality (cf. Bertalanffy, 1954). All our knowledge, even if de-anthropomorphized, only mirrors certain aspects of reality. If what has been said is true, reality is what Nicholas of Cusa (cf. Bertalanffy, 1928) called the coincidentia oppositorum. Discoursive thinking al- ways represents only one aspect of ultimate reality, called God in Cusa's ter- minology; it can never exhaust its infinite manifoldness. Hence ultimate reality is a unity of opposites; any statement holds from a certain viewpoint only, has only relative validity, and must be supplemented by antithetic statements from opposite points of view. Thus, the categories of our experience and thinking appear to be determined by biological as well as cultural factors. Secondly, this human bondage is stripped by a process of progressive de-anthropomorphization of our world picture. Thirdly, even though de-anthropomorphized, knowledge only mirrors certain aspects or facets of reality. However, fourthly, ex omnibus partibus relucet totum again to use Cusa's expression: Each such aspect has, though only relative, truth. This, it seems, indicates the limitation as well as the dignity of human knowledge. Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences REFERENCES ALLESCH, G. J.
