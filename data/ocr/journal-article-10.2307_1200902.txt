<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST GABRIEL VAHANIAN* N THE Old Testament it is stated that no one can see God and live. Paul Tillich expresses the same idea in modern phraseology by saying that "our ultimate concern can destroy us as it can heal us."' But we can never be with- out it. Whether in religious or mythical or poetic language, it is through sym- bols and images that this ultimate con- cern becomes concrete to the under- standing of our minds and hearts. The word God itself is symbolic. Very often, too, man's understanding of his trou- bles, if not directly of himself, is grasped in symbolic terms or through images. It would not be an exaggeration to say that man's cultural and religious develop- ment belongs in a sense to a world of symbols and images, in which all man- kind possesses a common heritage. In the Western world especially, psycho- analysis has shown that myths and sym- bols, though stifled by "secularism," continue to live in man's unconscious and are the most eloquent indications of man's incapacity ever to be without an ultimate concern. This incapacity actually is what distinguishes man from the animal. It maintains him above the level of the animal and indicates his po- sition at the juncture of the finite and the infinite, even if it degenerates into the arrogance and pride of the sicut dii of Genesis, which is but another form of the idolatry that is the constant dan- ger of faith. The trouble with our gener- ation is not that it lacks faith; it is much too idolatrous for that. It lies in the fact that its ultimate concern does not point beyond itself, to the possibility that it heals as well as destroys. This possibility is precisely that which inherently characterizes the classical problem of the Real Presence whether in terms of the essence of religion or in terms of symbolism. But to begin with, what is a symbol? A symbol is something that, first, points beyond itself and, second, points to the contingent congruence, existen- tially speaking, between the subject or subjects and the object of a particular experience, or-to revert to a different set of categories-between the word and the thing, the finite and the infinite, etc. Furthermore, this contingent congru- ence is but a humble though fecund oc- currence or event which is paradoxically both constant and occasional, that is to say, a charismatic2 instrument that * Gabriel Vahanian, assistant professor of religion at Syracuse University, was for three years instruc- tor in religion at Princeton University. Ile first came to this country on a scholarship from the World Council of Churches; and in 1958 he re- ceived the Th.D. degree at Princeton Theological Seminary. The present article is in the area of his doctoral dissertation, "Protestantism and the Arts." With a B.A. (Grenoble, France, 1945) and a B.D.

The danger of the former view is that it infirms the freedom and autonomy of the transcend- ent. The obvious, though not always clearly understood, superiority of the latter is that, in it, ultimately the sym- bol mediates the real presence of that which is and remains wholly other only by not assimilating itself with, or dero- gating from, the otherness of the Wholly Other. The crux of this whole matter may now be grasped effectively. While the opus operatum in the last analysis denies the "otherness" of the symbolized, the definition which sees in the symbol a charismatic reality emphasizes the fact that a symbol paradoxically mediates the Real Presence only when the ten- sion is maintained between the Symbol- ized and that which symbolizes, just as between God and man. God's act of cre- ation points to the qualitative difference between time and eternity, finitude and infinitude. His separation from the crea- ture means that finitum non est capax infiniti; but his presence in the handi- work of his creative act stresses no less that infinitum est capax finiti. If this is the language of paradox, it is also the language of faith, for which the wrath of God, for example, is not something irrational (as the nineteenth century believed) but the symbol of a something more which even our moralistic notions of God's goodness cannot adumbrate or, shall we say, obliterate.4 With this perspective, the ultimate role of the symbol consists in serving as a "point of contact" (Ankniipfungs- punkt) between the transcendent and the immanent, between the "I" and the "Thou." In a sense, the symbol is a kind of liminal archetype, on the one hand, of man's act of ancestral self-conscious- ness, in terms of his participation in the human kind in its entirety; on the other, of man's act of filial self-consciousness, in terms of his individual relationship to a reality above and beyond himself, or to the object of his ultimate concern, to the Absolute. But since, by virtue of our definition, the symbol concurs in the re- ality of that which is symbolized only charismatically, the "point of contact" correspondingly is to be regarded as a nexus of discontinuity: between God and man there lies an infinite qualitative difference.' And thus the point of con- tact is a vicarious one, not subjectively, but objectively speaking. As such, all its virtues are derived from the majesty of the transcendent. In itself, it is merely a secular reality. If it takes on any meaning, any signification, if it points to the sacred, to the Wholly Other, it can fulfil such a purpose only by not trans- gressing the boundaries of that Event which it symbolizes. For a symbol is endowed with the power to mediate as well as to hinder mediation: it is a screen in the ambivalent sense of the term. Practically speaking, our reflection thus comes to fruition in these particu- lar respects: 1. The symbol cannot be with impu- nity divorced from the context of natural</page><page sequence="3">228 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION phenomena from which it springs forth; biblical thought itself insists on the goodness of the creation, and this state- ment is but its corollary. However, the originality of biblical thought consists in an equal emphasis on a tension be- tween that which is symbolized and the co-agency of nature. 2. An unbiblical stress on the co- agency of nature would lead toward re- ligious syncretism, because of the fact that the variously disseminated symbolic apprehension of the supernatural pre- sents irrefragable similarities. Such would be, for instance, a certain tend- ency of the school of comparative reli- gions; nor is it wholly unwarranted in- asmuch as faith always tends to congeal and decay into the mold of religion, but not without having previously lost its salt, namely, the tension between the transcendence of the Wholly Other and the finiteness of nature. I Any symbol, especially a theological symbol, in the last analysis always op- erates against the background of a natu- ral phenomenon, even if its meaning is abysmally detached from that phenome- non. As Jean Danielou has pointed out: "The particular symbol is not capable of any signification, and even 'positive' symbolism always rests upon some natu- ral signification."6 Thus even the New Testament sym- bolism of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost is not severed from the natural symbolical significance of fire. The sacrament of baptism is intrin- sically bound up with the sacred mean- ing of water and its cleansing properties. From one end to the other of the lan- guage of the Bible, images abound which describe God's sovereign being and ac- tivity and which incomparably rely on the awe-inspiring observation of natural phenomena. There is no need for specific quotations; and they would outrun these critical observations. Their im- pact, however, can be here assessed by saying that they unfold to our sight a series of what might be termed "natural sacraments," provided these are under- stood as being nothing but "a visible word, or sculpture and image of that grace which the word more fully illus- trates."' Yet at this level there is always an interdependence between the natural event and the supernatural meaning it communicates. God is, so to speak, ap- prehended through nature-or perhaps it is only his shadow.s To the extent that this apprehension of God does not dis- tinguish him from the network of natu- ral events, we are confronted with idol- atry or with naturalism. In other words, the burning bush does not always reveal him who alone can say "Sum qui sum"; for Moses must first have removed his sandals: there is discontinuity between man as he is and him whose voice can be heard through the burning bush. Yah- weh does not always speak on top of Mount Sinai; for the people were al- lowed to follow Moses but halfway up the mountain: the thunder-punctuated dialogue through which God reveals himself at the same time conceals him.9 "I am who am" is a tension-ridden sym- bol which stresses both the distance and the proximity of God and in which God stands both revelatus and absconditus. It has no doubt been realized that for some time we have been grappling with the problem of natural religion or gen- eral revelation. But a full treatment of this question is beyond the scope of our concern. We must therefore content our- selves with some general remarks and</page><page sequence="4">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST 229 considerations. However, let us confess at the outset that, on the grounds of empirical observations, natural religion, or, say, paganism, is a privileged sphere of the religious symbol."? For natural religion paradoxically both stresses the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane and readily apprehends the pres- ence of a sacred reality in any profane constellation of things or events. Magic is not totally absent from this kind of religious sentiment, which tends to ob- literate the tension between the divine and the human by resting on the belief that the power of the former can be captured by the latter. Thus a theory of the symbol that could be developed on such a basis would imply the possibility of an osmosis between the natural and the supernatural, emphasizing the ca- pacity of the finite to take on the attri- butes of the infinite, rather than the freedom of the infinite to, reveal itself through the finite. In other words, the supernatural is apprehended only to that extent that the natural remains wrapped up in mystery beyond the grasp of in- telligence. But, by assimilating the infi- nite with the elusive though tantalizing dimensions of a natural event, the ulti- mate tendency is to confine it to these dimensions. It will thus be readily seen that natu- ral religion, though it can provide the symbol with a "noble religious founda- tion" (J. Dani6lou) and though it is probably the most typical expression of man's religiousness-the most religious -in the long run subordinates man to the cycles of nature, be they regular or capricious. Natural religion knows noth- ing of God's act in and through history, even though it reflects-darkly-"' his action in the visible universe." That natural religion in a sense con- stitutes a constant reminder that every- thing in the universe possesses a sacra- mental (i.e., symbolic) potentiality cannot form the object of any reason- able doubt. Indeed, the glory of God is reflected in the handiwork of his creative act. And we shall refrain in this con- nection from entering into a controver- sial interpretation of the numerous bib- lical loci classici.11 Suffice it to say at this point that natural religion does not come to grips with the Wholly Other's auton- omy over the universe of his creation. It may conceive him as creator, but that "creation" itself will be regarded as a part of the total cosmic process: crea- tion is not considered as a historical act, generated "from outside"; it is not a "historic event, the first of the actions of God in history."12 Or to put it in other words: natural religion contains a rather considerable propensity to grap- ple with the reticence of the deus reve- latus: if the bush has burned once, it must again and again let the vox dei sound forth; but the deus absconditus remains singularly absent from its field of vision. Thus, in the last analysis, natural religion is a sort of hypertro- phied "literalistic symbol" whose ritual eloquence frustratingly hides the barren- ness of man's solitude and his alienation from a mysterious universe. It has a keen eye and a keen ear for the beauties and the harmonies of the cosmos but de- prives itself of one element very impor- tant in the understanding of human na- ture: that is, the otherness of God and his separateness from his creation."3 And for this reason man in the frame- work of natural religion remains a self whose characteristic is estrangement, even though he is sensitive to the sym- bolism of the cosmos, because this sym- bol ultimately does not point beyond it-</page><page sequence="5">230 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION self: between man and the Other there is no dialogue-for such dialogue can only consist in a sum qui sum, that is, a tension in the apprehension of a God both near and afar off, a tension be- tween revelation and the natural order. Though expressed rapidly, these views clearly result from regarding the creation story of Genesis as a pair of glasses'4 designed to show that God is both present in, and independent of, his creation. That is also the reason why we are inclined to agree with Danielou, who considers the story of Genesis as a polemic against the mythical conception. It represents a correction of this distortion and restores the elements of cosmic symbolism (that had been interpreted in a mythical sense by paganism) to their real value as the expres- sion of the creative and judicial primacy of God. In doing so, however, the biblical revelation is only reforming natural religion and returning its symbols to their true sense. Yet its true dignity does not lie in this direction. Its essen- tial object is to render testimony to the historic action of God. And here we come upon a pro- found reversal in the reality of things which involves a parallel reversal in religious concep- tions. God no longer reveals himself through the regularity of the cycles of the cosmos alone, but by the singularity of historic events as well, his- toric events which are so many creative acts and which constitute sacred history: the elec- tion of Abraham, the flight from Egypt, the Davidic line of royalty, the incarnation of Christ, His resurrection, the sacraments of the Church, the last judgment. In this perspective the conception of creation takes on a new sense; it becomes a historic event, the first of the actions of God in history.15 Behind the preceding statement there lies, of course, Danielou's tacit defini- tion of myth. It is not our purpose to take sides on this issue, for it is well known that various authors attribute different meanings to this fabulous phenomenon which commonly charac- terizes all mankind. But we shall make some necessary clarifications. While, for example, in the vocabulary of today's world, myth often signifies ideology, in Bultmann's interpretation the signifi- cance of the myth lies in an entirely different direction in that it is die Vorstellungsweise, in der das Unweltliche, G6ttliche als Weltliches, Menschliches, das Jenseitige als Diesseitiges erscheint, in der z. B. Gottes Jenseitigkeit als raumliche Ferne gedacht wird; eine Vortellungsweise, der zufolge der Kultus als ein Handeln verstanden wird, in dem durch materielle Mittel nichtmaterielle Krifte vermittelt werden.'6 Thus, in Bultmann's view, the myth makes no claim of yielding an objective description of the universe; its concern is anthropological rather than cosmolog- ical, that is to say, it constitutes a means of expressing man's self-understanding in the framework of the world. For this reason, Bultmann's is an "existential" interpretation, in the sense that the myth "redet vom Unweltlichen weltlich, von der Gittern menschlich," as well as "von der Macht oder von den Maichten, die der Mensch als Grund und Grenze seiner Welt und seines eigenen Handelns und Erleidens zu erfahren meint."'7 The im- portance of Bultmann's view resides in the fact that, on the one hand, the myth contains within itself the principle of self-criticism, that is, the criticism of its objectivizing representations; on the other hand, it intends to express man's ultimate dependence not on the apparent realities of the known world but on a power or powers which form the ground and boundary of what is visible and known. In other words, it purports to reveal a certain understanding of man's nature and his existence, as subordinated to a transcendent reality. Thus, when Bultmann sees the meaning of the cre- ation story to lie in this direction, he dif- fers little if at all from Daniblou. "The transcendence of God receives its clas-</page><page sequence="6">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST 231 sical expression in the doctrine of the creatio ex nihilo, a notion utterly incon- ceivable to the Greek mind, though a logical development from the premises of Biblical thought."'8 It is not without reason then that even at its best the Greek myth is not quite as fecund as the biblical, for in the former man re- mains the measure of all things in the context of a harmonious cosmos.'9 But, for our purposes, what these two authors have in common is apparent. For both of them the importance of the Genesis story lies in the fact that the perspective from which this story is told differs incomparably from that of any other. And its significance consists in that it views, or, rather, discovers, the historicity of human existence20 in the fullest dignity of its urgency all the more because it detaches it from the imper- sonality of nature and its cycles. In a parallel way, furthermore, the biblical myth achieves this aim by the notion of a creatio ex nihilo, that is to say, first by attributing to God the power of crea- tion and, second, by considering God's creative initiative as the index of both his sovereignty over the creation and history and the irruption of the tran- scendent into the immanent. For from the greatness and beauty of created things Does man correspondantly form the image of their first maker. But yet for these men there is but small blame, For they too peradventure do but go astray While they are seeking God and desiring to find him. For living among his works they make diligent search And believe their sight, because the things that they look upon are beautiful. But again they are not to be excused. For if they had power to know so much, That they could explore the course of things How is it that they did not sooner find the Sovereign Lord of these works?21 In contrast to the myth of classical cul- ture, whether Greek or Roman, the bib- lical myth thus contributes a very sig- nificant emphasis to the man's self-un- derstanding. As Reinhold Niebuhr writes, it "abstracts" the transcendent altogether from the realm of the imma- nent as well as the ground of meaning of man's existence from that very exist- ence; that is the reason why Niebuhr rightly observes: "The God of mythical religion [i.e., biblical, prophetic religion] is significantly the Creator and not the First Cause."22 Whereas, generally speaking, one might be led to regard myth as a pre- scientific world view, Niebuhr considers it not as prescientific but as a supra- scientific world view. Primarily, it is transhistorical, and one might also say transrational instead of subrational. It does appear, indeed, that for Reinhold Niebuhr the validity of a religion is tested by the myth that constitutes the key of its interpretation. Consequently, the distinctive significance of the He- braic myth, as pointed out above, is de- cisive for Niebuhr's thought. It helps him to affirm both the polarity and the dichotomy between time and eternity, between immanence and transcendence, between man and God. And in this view man, though a finite creature, nonethe- less can strive toward the infinite-yet he cannot reach it, for, if he did, the tension between the finite and the infinite would be attenuated and finally can- celed. Not that Niebuhr fails to acknowledge any alternative to mythical thinking. In fact, it may be said to consist of a twofold possibility: either a rational or a mystical one. But the rational would again impugn the tension between fini- tude and infinitude; and the mystical</page><page sequence="7">232 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION would dismiss the dichotomy between immanence and transcendence.23 "In this sense," Niebuhr writes, "the myth alone is capable of picturing the world as a realm of coherence and meaning without defying the facts of incoherence. Its world is coherent because all facts in it are related to some central source of meaning." Yet it must be stressed again that this central source lies out- side the very coherence of this world, which furthermore is not "rationally coherent because the myth is not under the abortive necessity of relating all things to each other in terms of im- mediate rational unity."24 It is now possible by way of applica- tion to bring forward the argument that biblical myth consists in (1) a constant confrontation of man's existential his- toricity with the Wholly Other's tran- scendence; (2) a rejection of orthodox otherworldliness, i.e., either of the sac- ramentarian or of the dogmatic25 sym- bol, because it vitiates the vertical ten- sion between historical fact and tran- scendent source or between history and eternity; and (3) a rejection of liberal Christianity, i.e., of the symbol evacu- ated of both paradox and numinous, be- cause it naively but self-deceivingly ob- jectivizes God into the representations of his revelation by assuming one-sided- ly that there may be revelation without its awesome corollary-concealment- and because it abbreviates God's inter- vention in history to the dimensions of an ephemeral human achievement. It is in the light of biblical myth that we have so far devoted our attention to man's quest and its relation to sym- bolism. But, whatever its characteristics and its specific meaning within the bounds of the faith that it quickens and nurtures, even the biblical myth for- mally rests at least on the vocabulary and representations of this world. The anthropomorphism of the Old Testa- ment, for example, is a case in point. It may be contended that this interpreta- tion of the biblical myth is somewhat peculiar, however, and relies on proper- ties of biblical thought which others may read differently. We have no reason to disagree with such a contention-or to invalidate it. For even if, from the stand- point of faith, we are inclined to under- line the uniqueness of the biblical myth, intellectually speaking, we readily ac- knowledge that its constituency is made up of human and this-worldly elements. In other words, its burden of uniqueness is made to be borne not by the objectiviz- ing tendencies of its modes of represen- tation but by the experience and the con- comitant commitment that these arouse in the believer, as by the self's act of awareness of its dependence upon, and relationship to, the transcendent source of its selfhood. In this sense we meet the objection of our hypothetical con- tender. For our interpretation forces us to recognize that not even God's revela- tion (or concealment) is limited to or by the instrumentality of the biblical myth, because, if it were, the myth would have transgressed the charismatic na- ture of the ancillary function with which it is intrusted. Incidentally, this amounts to saying of biblical myth that its contempora- neity with the world view in whose con- text it is laid is still pregnant with mean- ing and maintains its relevance in rela- tion to our conception of the universe and our understanding of man's destiny only if it does not, so to speak, lord it over today's Weltanschauung. On its positive side, for instance, Bultmann's</page><page sequence="8">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST 233 demythologizing perspective into the biblical world view lends its support to our own interpretation of the biblical myth as well as to our definition of the symbol. And, from this, the assertion is drawn that the drive toward sym- bolism is inherent in the nature of man and that it represents an attempt to re- deem the actual (i.e., the concrete) reality in which man finds himself en- meshed while searching for the question that will reveal the key to his self-under- standing; but the biblical version and acknowledgment of this drive insist on the provisional aspects of its symbolic manifestation by inserting the wedge of tension between the natural and the supernatural and thus by distinguishing the Word from the flesh, even when the Word itself becomes flesh. This characteristic, more than any other, is the most important factor in contrasting biblical religion with other religious quests, although in both cases the underlying symbolic structure on which the myth is developed might pre- sent certain affinities and similarities. But ultimately these various correspond- ences would merely disclose the fact that man is a religious animal. Neither is this denied by biblical thought. There- fore, there is absolutely no need in this connection to disagree with Cassirer's statement that "the religious symbols change incessantly, but the underlying principle, the symbolic activity as such, remains the same: una est religio in rituum varietate."26 But perhaps the im- portant thing itself is "religiously" over- looked by Cassirer himself. It is also true, as Cassirer contends, that "the specific forms of religious feeling and the inner unity of religious thought" may prevail in every religious manifesta- tion.2 It does not follow, however, that this constant "inner unity" necessarily contains the infallible suggestion that "una est religio." For, contrary to his opinion, this "inner unity" may not so much convey that "una est religio" as that it is "una" especially "in rituum varietate" (italics ours). What Cassirer is stressing is then nothing more than the liminal statement of biblical thought, namely, man's innate religiosity to which the scriptural myth adds the hint that this religiosity often, if not always, soars into pious but pharisaic irreligiousness -into idolatry. Religion normally seeks status in some rite or another. Actually, religion is only when it has engendered its own variety of rites and customs-or beliefs, if these should perform the role of rites. Thus, when Cassirer puts such a heavy emphasis on the uniqueness or rather oneness of religious experience-though empirically and from the standpoint of finite things he might be right-in real- ity a large portion of that emphasis is shouldered by the rites themselves, which always cluster about the very cen- ter of religious apprehension. Inasmuch as the symbol itself indeed does not al- ways resist its inescapable propensity to sclerosis, i.e., its constant drift to- ward replacing that which it should simply stand for, it is almost inevitable that religion should strive toward ritual- ism or dogmatism or both.28 If the Wholly Other can be made to "abdicate" before some incongruent, though em- pirically not always extrinsic, power of the symbol-even as an absolute can be ushered into being, which is thoroughly false and essentially inauthentic for the very reason that it is invested with every attribute of the genuine absolute29-if the symbol (i.e., the literalistic or sacra- mentarian symbol) can undergo a proc-</page><page sequence="9">234 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ess of liquification, which in the last analysis either removes the Wholly Other from any propinquity to the self or corresponds but to an instauration of false and consequently unqualified intermediaries between them, it is no wonder then that religion should harden into a variety of rites and beliefs. But if at that moment "the specific forms of religious feeling and the inner unity of religious thought" are still preserved, it will be thanks to those very rites and beliefs which always maintain by na- ture some degree of similarity (because they are rites and beliefs) and not in the least thanks to any identity between their respective ultimate concerns. Fur- thermore, the ultimate concern, in the perspective of biblical thought, is dras- tically severed from any pursuit that puts its imprint on all merely religious manifestation; on the contrary, it stands in constant opposition to the object of what remains but the diagram, or the symptom, of a finite quest.30 In this sense, Cassirer's demonstration that "una est religio in rituum varietate," to begin with, begs the question; and, finally, the statement itself does not fall short of being simply tautological. In the biblical view, faith, or the ulti- mate encounter between the infinite and the finite, is described as an event which exposes the barrenness and the idola- trous waste of the finite's attempt to grasp hold of, and sacramentally replace, the inaccessibility of the infinite, through new moons and sabbaths and burnt offerings.31 But it is the tragedy of faith that it succumbs to the lucrative temptation of religion.32 For this reason there is, then, no in- consistency, phenomenologically, in re- garding biblical revelation as being re- lated to man's religious quest. Actually, within or without Christianity, many have considered the problem solely from this angle, especially when it has par- ticularly dealt with revelation and nat- ural religion and has been approached as a result of a search into the meaning of symbolism-that is, indiscriminately, religious symbolism. Our intention is to tackle this problem without disparaging or dismissing nat- ural religion and without parochially taking shelter behind the uniqueness of biblical revelation. After all, what would be the point in it, and what would be so unique about revelation if (pre- cisely) it did not address itself to natural religion? Shall not he who would save it lose his life? But where the perfectionistic notion of a partial agreement between nature and grace is insisted upon-which al- ways implies the toying with the idea of man's apotheosis (i.e., the inconsistency of the perfectibility of sin)-we shall rather, in conjunction with our under- standing of the biblical myth, make it a point to stress the inexorable tension be- tween revelation and natural religion. Otherwise, biblical revelation would be a pseudo-divine monologue or a Canaan- ite dialect; it could not be the dialogue that sustains the paradoxical encounter between "I" and "Thou." II Alfred Lombard remarks that in the eighteenth century Father Tournemine in his Traitg de l'origine des fables had already made the statement that the oneness of God had been intimated by every religion.33 Does this mean that religious syncretism is the moral out- come of an unbiased study of the myth and its symbolic significance? Further</page><page sequence="10">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST 235 still, does it also mean that, if religion is rid of its particularistic outgrowths, it will reveal nothing other than the pro- lific scheme of a common but single quest-that of man in search of a soul and the meaning of his existence? There was a time when pagan mythology was regarded as merely decorative, while the dogma of the church alone provided the irrefutable basis of true religion, at least, for convention's sake. Was this a betrayal of Christianity or a tacit ad- mission of another religion's worth? And today Simone Weil contends that in the last analysis it was Greece, not Chris- tianity, which was betrayed by the Ren- aissance, because the Renaissance self- righteously sought in Greece merely something different from Christianity and thus understood neither, let alone Greece. But, significantly, she adds: "La faute en est au christianisme qui s'est cru autre que la Grace. On re- mediera &amp; ce mal en reconnaissant dans la pensee grecque toute la foi chreti- enne."34 Must one surrender all the essentials of biblical faith in order to let the ele- ments of nature, air, water, fire, and wind regain the significance they lost when they were domesticated and dese- crated? There may or may not be antino- my between Athens and Jerusalem. But it would in no way reflect the tension be- tween the finite and the infinite. As a symbol of the infinite, even Jerusalem should not transform itself into the base of a new-fangled tower of Babel. For the tension, or the qualitative difference between time and eternity, can easily be- come quantitative, as between Athens and Jerusalem, or paganism and ortho- doxy: only faith can keep it out of that path-yet faith in itself is not immune to the petrification of orthodoxy. Those who favor a certain religious syncretism ordinarily do so because they think that pagan mythology had pre- served a sense of "life abundant," which is, to say the least, atrophied by ortho- doxy, and that, the more religion be- comes again diffracted, the more it is able to recapture the fulness of this life abundant with all its mysterious trepida- tion. Soon, orthodoxy, as Lombard writes, dissolves into deism or panthe- ism; but the price is rather cheap if one considers that the key symbol of ortho- doxy has always rested on the vindictive dichotomy of sacred and secular. And thus, as a result, "une religiosite diffuse se repand dans la poesie et dans l'art et peu a peu les fictions de la mythologie retrouvent la vie qu'elles avaient perdue et comme une presence reelle; et c'est ainsi que notre temps devait revoir, comme l'a dit Mallarme, leur significa- tion rendue a la lumiere, aux nudes, a 1air."35 The drive toward symbolism can be stifled by orthodoxy or inflated and made turgid by mythology; it remains a per- manent trait of mankind, and its func- tion cannot be effectively dismissed by him who seeks who he is.36 [It] appears as an essential habit of our psy- chic structure. It is an essential movement of the spirit which leads it to disengage, beyond all purely sensible reality, the intelligible sig- nification which the latter contains. On the other hand, this movement is not a subjective movement. It is not the projection of its own content into objects by the Spirit. Quite con- trarily, it emerges as a set of objective dis- coveries of an objective content in symbol. The latter, therefore, is a reality which is exterior to the Spirit and reveals itself to the Spirit.37 For, in terms of religious reality, sym- bolism is the only way that "the infinite and transphenomenal''38 can be com- municated. Mythology or natural reli-</page><page sequence="11">236 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION gion is quite sensitive to this fact. So is revelation, but without underwriting any assumption that natural religion is in the position of a lower-story rela- tionship with revelation.39 Not that revelation is to be deprived of the prime- val vitality of creation and its dyna- mism; but it contradistinguishes itself from the tentative self-understanding for which the latter is constantly sighing. Yet it does not dismiss the sigh of the creation.40 That is the reason why the religious symbol is sometimes phenome- nal, that is, surreal: in this way it at- tempts to express all the possible cos- mic interpretations whereby man can locate himself. Sometimes it has recourse even to distortion, purely and simply, as the several arms and legs in the figure of a god look phenomenal in order to convey the sense of transphenomenal. But "such distortion," as Urban re- marks, "is apprehended as a symbol and not as a literal picture, and expresses 'values more real than the real val- ues.' ,"41 Thus in more ways than one, and especially here, it is the surreal that bears the meaning of the real. Nor is one an idealist for arriving at such a state- ment:42 no disparagement of the real is advocated for the sake of a heaven of ideals and forms. Just as biblical revelation does not shun but addresses natural religion, so the real, the phenomenal (in the philo- sophical sense, now), must not be shunned either. And the fact that a god is represented with several legs and arms signifies that gap that stretches between the real and the transphenome- nal, between nature and revelation, and that nature stands both in "symmetry and agreement"43 with grace and as its distortion. The symbol is the transla- tion of such a realization: it is an exis- tential intelligence into the nature of man and the universe. As for the experi- ence which it has made intelligible, it may be rendered by either the incarnate words of a poem, or the many-armed and many-legged figure of a god, or the reiterations of a litany. But, regardless of its various expressions, it will point to the redemption or redintegration of the actual, of nature, of man--of the creation which had sighed "cor meum inquietum donec requiescat in te.""44 The problem of religious syncretism inevitably arises in connection with any study of symbolism. Suffice it to say now that the archetypes that animate the non-Christian religions must not be robbed of the rays of God's sun which shine on the just as on the unjust. Even if their key-myth reveals them as essen- tially naturalistic, we must rejoice in the fact that the cycles of nature are all encompassed under the arc by which God intends to signify his faithfulness to his creation. And if we think, from our standpoint, that the periodicity of nature, the regularity of the cosmic panorama can at best point only to God's absence (i.e., his indirect presence) or to his distorted representation, we must not forget that this absence (i.e., this distance) may just conceal God's prox- imity. "Am I a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off? ... Do I not fill heaven and earth?""45 Even though an unwarranted em- phasis on the co-agency of nature makes for religious syncretism, it is undeniable that this co-agency corresponds to God's fidelity, insofar as it is, however, sub- ordinated to the latter. Because God fills heaven and earth, natural religion has been most rich in symbolic repre- sentations, and therefore "properly speaking religious symbolism is the</page><page sequence="12">BIBLICAL SYMBOLISM AND MAN'S RELIGIOUS QUEST 237 visitation of God over and through the visible world.""46 III We may now ask the question, "What is the meaning of this quest for symbol- ism?" And wonder also why this drive toward symbolism is inevitable even in the most restrained or iconoclastic reli- gions. Religious symbolism is most tem- pered at least regarding sensuous re- splendence in, for example, Judaism and Islam and partially in Protestant- ism. Is it because they feel that the Absolute is too unapproachably afar off and therefore rather insist on the silence that alone can express the transcendent's incomprehensibility by a finite being? But the "cadence" of the Hebrew lan- guage47 or the Psalter and music of Protestantism may be just as richly com- manding in terms of symbolic density. The symbol may be quite tacit, or latent, or inconspicuous, as, for example, in those annunciations where the angel's words humbly flow into Mary's ear to signify her self-acceptance and readi- ness for her vocation. But it is always there, even in the ecstatic silence of the mystic. Its types may vary, but they al- ways "represent the inevitable search for the Infinite or God."48 Once again, what does this incessant quest signify? If in asking this question we bear in mind the biblical myth's archetype, i.e., the image of God lost through Adam and restored through the Christ, we may accordingly define this quest as the redintegration of the created, the redemption of the actual. Religious symbolism means a fresher or renovated look upon the lowliness of what is; it points toward the recapitula- tion, to use Irenaeus' term, of the whole creation. Conversely, it is most absent, or arid, where Manichaeism and where a withered otherworldliness have fostered a blend of religiosity whose fame lies alone in its deprecation of both the cre- ation and the actualness of daily exist- ence. For the function of the symbol consists in deciphering the deeper mean- ing of the present and the actual and not in sublimating it. The symbol achieves this end by penetrating the framework of day-to-day reality and gives it the atmosphere of a prodigal's return. In the words of Auden: God is no summer tourist. We're more than scenery to Him. He has a farmer's eye for ergot and tares. . . . There is no other want. All ac- tions and diversions of the people, their grey- hound races, their football competitions, their clumsy acts of love, what are they but the pitiful, maimed expression of that entire pas- sion, the positive tropism of the soul to God. ..... 0 windmills, 0 cocks, 0 clouds and ponds! Mother is waving from the tiny door! The quilt is turned down in my beautiful blue and gold room! Father, I thank Thee in ad- vance! Everything has been grand! I am coming home!49 This relevance of man's "clumsy" existence and quest in and to God's pur- pose had already been underlined by the medieval Myst~re d'Adam. In it the Genesis story was cast in a contempo- rary setting, indicating thereby that the biblical myth, in order to yield its mean- ing, must pervade yet not sublimate man's contemporary situation: the in- significant detail of life as well as its more tremendous attempt of self-under- standing become part of God's design, and thus the sacred is sacred only inas- much as it informs and transforms the secular. "This implies that every occur- rence, in all its everyday reality, is simultaneously a part in a world-his- torical context through which each part is related to every other, and thus is like-</page><page sequence="13">238 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION wise to be regarded as being of all times or above all time."50 But we are not forgetting the tension between nature and grace. Nor does the symbol decrease it when it places the actual in the perspective of the tran- scendent and thus faces it toward its redemption. For the redintegration of the created has now become part of the Creator's self-disclosure, even though the gap between them has remained or rather because it has not been filled. That this enrobes man's situation with both the trust and the dubitation that are constituent of the paradox is not to be denied but emphasized. "It is pure spir- itual Religion which with one hand de- prives the artist of his specifically reli- gious art, but which, with the other, offers him, in exchange, a whole world to be religiously animated.""' It is for this reason that the daily and actual could become the subject matter of Western culture, especially after the Reformation, and that Rembrandt and Van Gogh, to cite only these two, turned to the scenes in whose midst they lived, to the wage-earners and the potato- eaters as well as the anatomy lesson. When the priest and the saint obstruct the symbol's contemporaneous thrust (6lan) or penetration into the actual, in order to achieve the redintegration of the created, a protest is in order. It was thus that in its ultimate reaches, the Reformation, though in some circum- stances it merely killed the joy of sin- ning, revealed "hitherto unmeasured depths of the human heart, and thereby [enabled] us to fathom much better the still deeper depths of the mysterious agonies of Golgotha." And Kuyper's concluding statement is far from being just apologetically parochial: "Eccle- siastical power no longer restrained the artist.'"52 Our thesis has been that the Reforma- tion had recovered for Western culture, not without delineating the limits of its power, the ultimate meaning of the sym- bol in the sense of a redintegration of the created. But the ironic tragedy of the Protestant era has been that it soon forgot what dynamic truth it had re- vealed to the artist. And together with the artist, weaned too early, modern man became fascinated with his new lease of life and, for the callousness of his orthodox censors, not unlike Van Gogh, left home. NOTES 1.
