<plain_text><page sequence="1">f i r s t w o rd africa95: Many Stories about the Art of a Continent frica95 was an August-to-December "Season Celebrating the Arts of Afri- ca" in the U.K. It originated with and was built around the exhibition "Africa: The Art of a Continent" held at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and curated by Royal Academician Tom Phillips, a well- known British artist and collector of African art. The decision early in the planning process to address the art of the whole continent but to leave out any works of the twentieth century that smack of Euro-American influence led to the development of africa95 as a contemporary arts festival. This "artist-led season of events" featured exhibitions and programs divided into the visual arts, cinema, music, the per- forming arts, and literature. All were sup- plemented by conferences, workshops, and residencies to maximize the goal of promoting "exchange and collaboration between artists" and creating "long-lasting ties between artists and audiences in Africa and the UK," accord- ing to the Chairman of africa95, Sir Michael Caine. The visual arts section of the official pro- gram lists twenty-four exhibitions at various venues, but it omits many installations at pri- vate galleries and includes only one of the eight African exhibitions at the Museum of Mankind. By my count there were over fifty exhibitions, most of which were in London (see p. 91 for a more comprehensive listing). The whole celebration was truly an impres- sive accomplishment, rivaled perhaps only by the First World Festival of Negro Arts, held in Dakar in 1966, and the African Festival of Art and Culture, held in Lagos in 1977. Clementine Deliss, Artistic Director of africa95, who also spearheaded "Seven Stories about Modem Art in Africa" at the Whitechapel Art Gallery (see her article on p. 36), is to be credited with much of this collective achievement. Nine exhibition catalogues and six exhibitions are reviewed in these pages. Several of the publications, espe- cially Vital (reviewed by Mary Nooter Roberts on p. 90) and The Art of African Textiles (the cat- alogue reviewed by Victoria Rovine on p. 19, the exhibition by Kathleen Bickford on p. 73), closely reflect their respective exhibitions. In this column I will consider a selection of pro- jects not otherwise covered and offer some personal comments about some that are. Re- garding the latter, I must begin by adding my own thoughts to those expressed in this issue by Roy Sieber (p. 68) and Olu Oguibe (p. 12) about what has been variously described as the "catalyst," "centerpiece," "flagship," and "pro- vocation" of africa95. "Africa: The Art of a Continent" will I hope be the last project that has the arrogance to assume that this subject matter can be dealt with thoughtfully in a single exhibition.

Most scholars today would agree that comprehensive consid- eration of the arts of Africa must necessarily include the whole continent. But the larger the universe of forms to be selected from, the more personal and idiosyncratic the selection will inevitably be. There is a touch of the absurd in continuing to think that an intelligent survey of the arts of Africa can be accomplished even with 800 objects. It says something about the West's view of Africa when many of its con- temporary institutions still feel that the conti- nent's art can be reduced to a single exhibition. I seriously doubt that anyone would suggest doing a show titled "Europe: The Art of a Continent." And if such a project were to be attempted, what would be the reaction if art of the twentieth century were excluded! It is ironic that an exhibition that strived so hard to go back in time would refuse to look to the present. Visitors to the Royal Acad- emy saw a quartzite core from Olduvai Gorge dated 1.6-1.7 million B.P., a hand axe from South Africa (600,000 B.P.), and a charcoal drawing of an antelope from the Apollo 11 site in Namibia (25,500-27,500 B.P.). They were offered nothing that could be called modern or contemporary. The rationale for this exclusion was not to be found anywhere in the exhibi- tion or catalogue. We can be grateful, howev- er, that this decision gave birth to africa95. If an exhibition is to be judged merely by the selection of objects that goes into it, then Tom Phillips did a much better job than many could do (see his article on p. 24). There were a large number of unpublished, breathtaking objects, and some real surprises, several of which are singled out by Phillips and Sieber in this issue. Unfortunately, if there were 400 exceptional pieces in the installation, there were also 400 pedestrian works. Nevertheless this percentage of achievement is higher than for most exhibitions of any sort. Phillips's goal of "relative even-handedness" was undoubt- edly challenged by the vagaries of budget, time, and lender reticence. An exhibition, of course, is not just a selec- tion of objects; it is design, lighting, labeling, and more. Tom Phillips gets good marks for his efforts, but those of the Royal Academy were a dismal failure. The large display cases, some of them twelve to eighteen feet wide, were backed by alternating black and pale turquoise panels that distracted the viewer and in no way enhanced the art. Labels were placed on either side of these cases, frequently forcing one to walk several steps, half the time in the wrong direction, to search for the appropriate (mini- mal) identification, which was situated with no apparent logic. The lighting was appallingly insensitive to the sculpture-it was designed as if it were a painting show. Everything was worse on opening night: many cases were still not dressed, lit, or labeled. It is not dear to me if this is the norm for the Royal Academy, the result of poor planning, or simply a reflection of the Academy's attitude toward the material. In any case it was inexcusable. The catalogue is monumental in scope and moderately priced (?25 at the Royal Acad- emy), considering that virtually all objects are reproduced in color, but it nevertheless repre- sents a missed opportunity. Expedience rather than expertise seems to have driven many of the choices of contributors for catalogue entries. While I have considerable respect for Nigel Barley, for example, I wonder if one of the many Benin specialists might have brought more original insights to the sixteen Benin objects that he addresses in his single extended entry. Likewise, Timothy Garrard, a brilliant scholar of Akan metalwork, also writes entries on Akye, Guro, and Senufo woodcarving, and Djenne terracotta and bronze sculpture. Assigning some of these areas to other specialists might have avoided Garrard's drastic error of identifying an Igbo female mask as a Guro work (Fig. 5.122a). Of all the contemporary African art exhibi- tions on display during africa95, one in particu- lar caught my eye: "Signs, Traces, Calligraphy: Five Contemporary Artists from North Africa" at the Concourse Gallery of the Barbican Centre, curated by Rose Issa. Issa's brief intro- ductory essay was titled "From Calligraphy to Calligraphism &amp; Calligraffiti." Her section titles for the five artists are telling: Ahmed Moustafa: The Alchemy of Letters Ali Omar Ermes: Painting the Alphabet Rachid Koraichi: The Secret Meaning of Writings Nja Mahdaoui: A Choreographer of Letters Mehdi Qotbi: A Visual Incantation The work of all these artists is strong, but I found that of Mahdaoui, a Tunisian, especial- ly compelling (see "New Acquisitions," p. 80, for examples of work by Mahdaoui and Ermes). He juxtaposes large Arabic letters with very fine, small inscriptions. Issa cap- tures his work beautifully: "Mahdaoui is care- ful not to emphasize the meaning of words, but stresses instead the visual effect of com- positions. His 'calligrams' evoke infinite plea- sure in rhythms, fast or slow, born from the tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away." In addition to this exhibition and one on another Tunisian artist, Khaled Ben Slimane (the latter's brochure reviewed by Roberts, p. 90), Rose Issa mounted two other exhibitions with pamphlets, both at the Leighton House Museum. "Chant Avedissian: Icons of the Nile" featured monoprints by an Egyptian artist of Armenian heritage who works with stencils on corrugated cardboard bordered with cloth (see "New Acquisitions," p. 80). These floor-length pieces feature Egyptian politicians, singers, and television and movie stars. Avedissian original- ly had the idea of renting them out for special events, as Egyptian tent makers do. The brochure illustrates smaller works stenciled on recycled paper with single images of famous people like King Farouq or with animal images or still lifes.

"Bakou" is the name for brown paper bags used to carry goods from the market, al- though very large canvas bags also serve as a surface for the artist's painting of abstract organic forms, anthropomorphic images, and objects from daily life. Although her considerable body of work prior to this time was unknown to me, with four exhibitions in three months, Rose Issa has established herself as one of the leading authorities on North African artists. The Serpentine Gallery displayed "Big City: Artists from Africa," a splendid installa- tion of the works of six wildly divergent artists. Two of them, the wood sculptor Johannes Segogela from South Africa and the photogra- pher Seydou Keita from Mali, were featured in recent "Portfolios" in African Arts (Winter 1995, Autumn 1995). Keita's work was just exhibited at the National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C., and it is also available on CD ROM, perhaps a first for an African artist. His intimate black-and-white portraits play with pattern, texture, pose, and dressing up. Few stiff postures here. A comfortable natural- ism dominates, with warm depictions of peo- ple touching, holding, and leaning on each other. In an interview by Andr6 Magnin pub- lished in the catalogue, Keita said, "I stopped taking photographs [in 1977] when colour took over. Everyone likes it now, but it's machines that do the work. Today a lot of people get called photographers, but all the same, plenty of them don't know a thing." "Big City" also appropriately includes a vi- sionary work by Bodys Isek Kingelez of Zaire. He was introduced to U.S. audiences in 1993 by Susan Vogel in the exhibition and publica- tion "Home and the World" at the Museum for African Art, New York City, which featured four maquettes of his fantastic miniature struc- tures. Not architectural models but rather fully realized sculptures, these four "buildings" were forerunners of Kimbeville, displayed at the Serpentine, a 1993-94 work that evokes a "21st century environment" whose futuristic archi- tecture includes multiple high-rises, a sports stadium, and several structures that suggest a theme park. Part satire, part hope, the work is based on Kingelez's vision for his home town. The fourth artist was Fred6ric Bruly Bouabr6 of C6te d'Ivoire, whose 206 crayon and ballpoint drawings on cardboard, each ap- proximately 4" x 6", are from the series "Con- naisance du Monde," 1985-95. The subject matter ranges from tools and weapons, to "extracts from the Bete alphabet" and "impres- sions of signs observed on kola nuts," to polit- ical commentary. Beninois artist Georges Ad6agbo's work at the Serpentine Gallery was a site-specific instal- lation called L'Art et l'Evolution, a mixed-media work that frankly I had trouble responding to, but perhaps it deserved more time to appreciate. Also from Benin, Cyprien Tokoudagba painted the Serpentine's entry gallery with eight murals depicting various Fon deities. These were some of the same gods the artist represented in ten large canvases in the "Vital" exhibition at Tate Gallery Liverpool. Tokoudagba's bold graphic forms in both exhibitions make these works among the most compelling in contemporary African art (see "Portfolio," p. 62). Nevertheless, the site-spe- cific images, commissioned as part of a resi- dency program at the Serpentine Gallery, have since been painted over. With the excep- tion of the two ephemeral works by Ad6agbo and Tokoudagba, all the pieces in the exhibi- tion were from the renowned Jean Pigozzi Contemporary African Arts Collection. The eighteen-page catalogue features statements by or interviews with the artists. In addition to "Vital" at the Tate, Liverpool also hosted "Cross-Currents: New Art from Senegal" at the Bluecoat Gallery, which pre- sented recent works by Jean-Marie Bruce, Fod6 Camara, Serigne Mraye Camara, Mous- tapha Dime, Abdoulaye Ndoye, Cheikh Niass, Kan-Si, and El Hadji Sy. Some of our readers will know Sy's spectacular kites from the recent music video of the famed Senegalese singer Youssou N'dour. Sy spent most of the eighties using only his feet to paint with. It's good to see that he has them firmly planted on the ground in these works. Bruce's pieces, most of them titled Environment, are construct- ed of weathered woods and sheet metals in largely rectilinear formats. He does this better than most. 8 african arts* summer 1996 a:: &lt; I :- .; ?:.-i . .

With its carefully thought-out and professionally designed exhibitions of compelling art, this institution has done more in its history to pro- mote the "traditional" arts of Africa than virtu- ally any other museum. The impending move of the department from its current location at Burlington Gardens to the old library space of the British Museum proper is being viewed by many as a potentially stifling initiative. Christopher Spring, John Mack, Nigel Barley, and Julie Hudson cover seven Museum of Mankind exhibitions on display during africa95 (p. 48), but they don't include the instal- lation of nine exquisite ceramics by Magdalene Odundo (whose work was featured in African Arts, Winter 1996). Ironically (or better, stupid- ly), this accomplished and internationally rec- ognized artist was not invited to one of the premier events of africa95, the workshop of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, because Robert Loder, one of the principal organizers of africa95, considered her a "craftswoman." There were a number of commercial gal- leries exhibiting African works that were not formally listed as part of africa95. The October Gallery had three exhibitions simultaneously. Featured as one of Nigeria's representatives to the 1990 Venice Biennale, the Ghanaian artist El Anatsui showed stunning examples of his sculpture and reliefs shaped by a chainsaw, col- ored by fire, and assembled with subtle imagi- nation. His works have always engaged my eye and encouraged my desire to own. Rows of wood figures intended to be repositioned in dif- ferent combinations have been a feature of his work for several years and create a changing human landscape with many moods. The second exhibition was a lackluster installation of Fante Asafo flags from the col- lection of Peter Adler, a London dealer and collector. The flags themselves were generally not up to the splendid quality of those from his collection that have been circulating around the U.S. for the past three years to museums that generally have stringent exhi- bition requirements for their own textiles but have had no qualms about showing the Adler material with questionable security, problem- atic mounting, and perilous lighting condi- tions. Ditto for the October Gallery. The photographic work of Angela Fisher and Carol Beckwith was an international hit in the publication African Ark. A preview of their next project, African Ceremonies, was also pre- sented at the October Gallery. Obviously Fisher and Beckwith are not African artists, but their subjects are African. As with both of their pre- vious publications, young women in seductive poses are a significant factor. Carefully staged shots are mixed with more candid pho- tographs. The preview included images from the Silver Jubilee of Asantehene Opoku Ware II, an international media event that produced 83471 SCHONAU-BERCHTESGADEN * TELEFON 00 49 86 52 / 6 50 90 * FAX 00 49 86 52 / 616 08 Why don't you combine your hobby African Arts with exciting holidays?

The Asante have astutely discovered that they can charge tourists, researchers, and the media for such singular events-in this case $2,000 for still photography and $10,000 for film and video. For Beckwith and Fisher it was certainly worth the price. On the Road: Works by Ten Southern African Artists (Keston Beaton, Willie Bester, Berry Bickle, Norman Catherine, Kendell Geers, William Kentridge, Kagiso Pat Mautloa, Ant6nio Ole, Reinata Sadimba Passema, Penny Siopis) actually serves as a catalogue (reviewed by Roberts, p. 90) for two exhibitions, the one it was explicitly associated with at the Delfina Studio Trust and a second show called "Mayibuye i Africa" at the Bernard Jacobson Gallery. The two installations offered works by six of the same artists, and both were largely curated by Linda Givon of the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg. The most impressive work in the first exhibition, Apartheid Laboratory by Willie Bester, was not illustrated in the cata- logue. This large, disturbing-even frighten- ing-sculpture features a mix of machine, surgical, and military imagery ostensibly intended to maintain a division of the races in South Africa. A barbed-wire and coiled-car- spring bed, a satellite dish made from a mortar shell and an enamelware bowl, and a "white's only" mirror reinforce the oppressive effect of this powerful work. In the catalogue Bester begins his artist's statement with "My whole The following, written by South African artist Kendell Geers, was distributed as a flyer at the open- ing of "On the Road: Works by Ten Southern African Artists" at the Delfina Studio Trust.

BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY Abomb has been hidden, somewhere within this exhibition, set to explode at a time known to the artist alone. While it is not my intention to kill anyone, that risk does exist. I apologise in advance for any injuries, fatalities, damage or other inconvenience that my work will cause. In this matter I have no choice, being as much a victim of the course of Art History and contemporary politics as those who are hurt in the process. I take con- solation in the fact that chance will be entirely responsible for the final statistics. The bomb will cause serious, if not struc- tural damage to the Virginal White Cube of the space as well as totally destroy any works of art in the immediate vicinity of the explo- sion. The debris and shrapnel will later be mounted and sold as individual sculptures. Any artists whose work may be damaged will be offered compensation for that work, which will then be re-framed or mounted and sold as collaborative pieces. Similarly the hospital and autopsy records, accounts, invoices, affidavits and photographic documentation will also be re- cycled into works of art. A police investigation will follow and a warrant issued for my arrest. Being guilty I will not resist, accepting full responsibility for my actions and the implications thereof. During the ensuing trial experts will be called upon for their opinions. Psychologists will examine my state of mind and give evidence regarding my sanity. Explosive Technologists will explain what the device was, where I was most likely to have obtained it from and why it caused the damage it did. Friends and acquaintances will be flown from all over the world as char- acter witnesses. And finally, but most impor- tantly, Art Historians, Critics, Philosophers and Sociologists will be called upon to explain why my actions constitute a relevant work of art at this point in time. History will later debate and decide on the merits of the piece. The trial will (as trials do) revolve around my intentions, which is to create a work of art relevant to this time, place and exhibition and not to kill anybody, but as we all know every struggle has its casualties. This text will be pre- sented as evidence of fair warning of the exis- tence of the bomb as well as of my intentions. Art, like its mentors war and religion, con- stitutes by definition the only legal forms of moral transgression. The form of the piece (being what amounts to a terrorist attack) is simply a contemporary African artist's response to the world he lives in and the histo- ries he has inherited. To condemn my struggle for what I believe in would be to condemn the beliefs and strategies of every Freedom Fighter in the world. In the African Art tradition, it is impossible to separate the mask from the ritual it was produced to be worn in, which was in turn an integral part of the social, politi- cal, economic and religious structures of the culture for whom it had meaning. Since the advent of Colonialism however we Africans have realigned our creativity to focus on the more pressing issues of Liberation instead. As a result we have be- come more adept at creating Revolutions and planting bombs than painting pretty pictures, even though they probably function culturally in much the same terms. In Africa, the Avant Garde artists are the Urban Guerrillas fighting for our Freedom. The court will naturally find me guilty as it attempts to defuse the real implications of the piece. I will most likely be sentenced to life imprisonment, a condition that will in the long term assist me in creating my second great- est work of art. Aluta Continua KENDELL GEERS interest now is with history." In his essay Ivor Powell writes: "Among the many tests used by the Race Classification Board established in terms of the Population Registration Act of 1950.... Individual hairs were subjected to analysis under a microscope. Noses were mea- sured against formulas determining length, breadth and bridge formation; the cuticles of fingernails were examined for colour contrast; the anus of the subject was scrutinized for any bluish tinge...." The Detroit Institute of Art has reportedly purchased this work and Soldier No. 2, which was also on display at the Delfina Studio Trust. Congratulations, Detroit. The conceptual artist Kendell Geers caught the attention of most visitors to the Delfina opening with a 5" x 8" flyer titled By Any Means Necessary which begins, "A bomb has been hidden, somewhere within this exhi- bition, set to explode at a time known to the artist alone." Geers then proceeds to describe the events following the explosion, including the exhibition and sale of the debris as art. In bomb-conscious London many thought this was in extremely bad taste, but the entire text (reprinted here) had a strange logic to it.

Most notable inside the gallery was Norman Catherine's Fanagalo Store. Arranged in rows on six shelves were about sixty small cut-out wood figures-a mix of devils, skele- tons, and monsters-interspersed with about twenty plaque-like faces, all brightly painted. One little headless figure has flames erupting from his neck, another has its head mounted on the end of its arm. Though they have something of the feel of cartoon characters, we nevertheless want to take this mass of bizarre humanity seriously. The "store" refer- ence in the title seems to speak of the commod- ification of both art and people. Other commercial gallery exhibitions were less remarkable. Having been impressed with Atta Kwami's Grace Kwami Sculpture (really an artist's book) in the 1994 exhibition at the National Museum of African Art, I was disap- pointed to see this Ghanaian artist's bland and unimaginative new work at the Beardsmore Gallery. The colorful abstract landscapes by Thomas Mukarobwa of Zimbabwe, at the Art for Mayfair, were engaging but not terribly original.

N. YC 10016 McEwen's collection. McEwen was founder of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and of the Workshop School that gave rise to the Shona stone carving tradition in the early sixties. The exhibition included sculptures dating from 1963 to 1972, which are generally smaller and fussier than the works best known today. Art First Gallery mounted two exhibitions in support of africa95. "Found in South Africa" was based on the now badly tarnished premise of "un-taught artists, many of them working in remote areas." Included here were wood sculp- tures by Noria Mbasa, Jackson Hlungwani, and Johannes Segogela as well as paintings and drawings by Tito Zungu, Derek Nxumalo, and Clifford Mpai, whose Little Brenthurst Garden, depicting part of the Oppenheimer estate where he worked as a waiter, was par- ticularly captivating. The second exhibition featured the work of Louis Maqhebela, a South African painter who has lived in London since 1973. There is very little that one can read as "African" in his relatively abstract work, which in my mind was one of the purposes of africa95 in the first place. Much of africa95 was about eliminating boundaries-between nations, cultures, reli- gions, and certainly between Africa and the rest of the world. It was also about diffusing the rigid categories used to pigeonhole African art. Susan Vogel's five-fold division of African art into Traditional, New Functional, Urban, International, and Extinct was often engaged with and frequently conquered. Much of africa95 was also about rethinking the traditional roles of curators and artists. Indeed, at least four major exhibitions were largely or entirely selected and organized by artists: "Art of a Continent" by Tom Phillips, "Play and Display" by Sokari Douglas Camp (its catalogue reviewed by Roberts on p. 90), "African Metalwork" by Magdalene Odundo (its catalogue reviewed by Raymond Silver- man on p. 93, the exhibition by Christopher Spring on p. 78), and "Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa" by a team of artists (the catalogue reviewed by Philip Ravenhill on p. 15). Results were mixed, with the sections on Senegal and Uganda/Kenya in "Seven Stories" among the least successful of all the africa95 offerings. El Hadji Sy's embarrassing and self- indulgent foregrounding of his own work at the expense of his two Senegalese compatriots was inexcusable. Wanjiku Nyachae's choices largely ignored the best artists working in Uganda and Kenya in favor of very weak material. The other artist-curators-Salah Hassan for Sudan and Ethiopia, Chika Okeke for Nigeria, and David Koloane for South Afri- ca-fared better. Koloane was especially suc- cessful: his selection of works by different artists on subjects surrounding the Sharpeville Massacre, the Soweto uprisings, and the mur- der of Steve Biko was one of the most poignant and memorable artistic successes of africa95. africa95 was among many things something of a coming-out party for South Africa. Its artists were probably better and more frequent- ly represented than those of any other country. With important works by Bester, Catherine, Kentridge, and Siopis, among others on view, the variety and complexity of contemporary South African art made a strong impression. africa95 was without question the most ambitious festival of African expressive culture to be presented outside the continent. That it was intensely political probably goes without saying. Its immediate impact was impressive- almost all events were well attended. Its lasting impact remains to be seen. Many of the two- hundred-plus reviews of the festival speculat- ed on just this issue. Nevertheless, from the perspectives of many African artists, it helped level the playing field. One of the most thoughtful reviews was written for Third Text by Everlyn Nicodemus, a contributor to the "Seven Stories" catalogue. She raised many of the key questions that informed decision making at several venues. "How to curate the art of another culture? How to select, how to interpret and present it as a broker to the receiving public? And how to guarantee that an exhibition generates reci- procal experience without simply functioning as a one-way import of cultural entertainment in a long tradition of colonial shows? Those are some of the crucial methodological and ethical issues of curating today in increasing intercultural and international exchange." These questions will undoubtedly remain for the near future.
