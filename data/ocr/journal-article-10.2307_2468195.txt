<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT LITERATURE BOOK REVIEWS Textbooks of plant physiology The third edition of GREEN'S Vegetable physiology, is a newly printed, if not a newly written, book. The first impression to be gained by one who is already familiar with the second edition is that the present volume is a better piece of book manufacture than the older one; especially are the figures brought out much more clearly on the new paper. A careful comparison of the second and third editions brings out the fact that the essentials of the book remain unchanged in the latter. A good many changes which comprise but a few words are to be noted; some statements are strengthened or weakened or dropped out; some records of discoveries or suggested hypotheses which were originally expressed in the present perfect tense are now thrown into the past; words and phrases are added or removed in the interest of clearness or of elegance; and the paragraphing of the older matter has been here and there improved. A number of new paragraphs have been inserted and some old ones have been supplemented; a few have been totally rewritten. In but a very few cases has the arrangement of the paragraphs been radically altered. A very few figures have been improved by redrawing. While the reviewer is convinced that practically all the changes made are in the direction of the improvement of an already very readable and scholarly treatise, he is distinctly of the opinion that these changes are gener- ally unimportant, and that those who know the second edition practically know also the third. In general, the chemical considerations seem better framed than the physi- cal ones; the former are often excellent, while the latter are more frequently slighted or seemingly treated in a merely perfunctory way. The time-worn logical fallacy, for example, of supposing that turgidity of cells is produced by hydrostatic pressure (a pressure exerted by water to distend a membrane permeable to water, through which, indeed, the very water to produce this outward pressure is supposed to have just passed!) is here met with anew. Even by assuming the position that the results of transpiration are the reasons for its occurrence, the reviewer is unable to follow the argument of p. 82, wherein it is implied that growth is slow in cacti, etc., because the trans- piration rate is low. The proposition appears to be that much water must be ' GREEN, J. REYNOLDS, An introduction to vegetable physiology. 3d ed. pp. xviii+470. figs. I82. Philadelphia: P.

After all, in spite of the cuticularization and the relatively small surface exposed by cacti, it is probable that such plants, in their desert habitat, transpire as much per unit of volume as do many very leafy and luxuriantly growing forms of the rainy tropical forest. Furthermore, the growth of the desert cactus occurs in the moister season of the year, exactly at the time when its transpiration is least, or at any rate when it would be least, were it not for the slightly cuti- cularized surfaces of the new growth. The advance of plant physiology away from the older anthropomorphic interpretation, which seems to characterize the opening of the present century, and the clear indication thus given that we shall ultimately have a purely rational physiology, leads the reviewer to deplore the fact that a text otherwise so perfect and so teachable should be so imbued with the old teleological view of natural phenomena. Of course, it is to be recognized that our science has not, in general, advanced far toward the elimination of this form of superstition; indeed, the author of the volume before us is perhaps with the majority of biologists when he shows that his is a teleological view of plant phenomena. Those teachers who wish to avoid as long as possible the complete reduction of biology to the uncolored and impersonal status of the other physical sciences will find here a textbook which will meet their requirements. For, aside from this imaginative coloring, the book is as nearly suited to its purpose as a book is apt to be. But it should be realized clearly that this is an account of physi- logical processes from the standpoint of the "benefit" or "advantage" or "purpose" or "aim" of the plant in allowing its various activities to be con- trolled by physical and chemical conditions. From p. 377 we select: "In considering broadly the result of stimulation we must notice at the outset that it provokes a purposeful response. The living substance appears to have a definite aim"; etc. The italics are the author's. Again, on the next page occurs, "Less conspicuously purposeful are those changes in metabolism which are brought about with the supply of food or oxygen, but even here evidence of purpose can be found if sought for." Our conclusion with reference to the work before us is that while it was for a decade the most satisfactory English elementary presentation of its subject, the advance of the science has made it unsuitable for class work, unless the instructor wishes, indeed, to emphasize the teleological aspect of physiology. The day of a true science of physiology seems to be at hand, judging from the increased activity in the general phase of this subject witnessed by the last few years. By a true science is meant here a physiology which belongs specifically neither to botany nor to zoology, a science of the phenomena of life, wherever these phenomena may occur. Those who have drawn inspira- tion and breadth of view from VERWORN'S Allgemeine Physiologie will welcome</page><page sequence="3">1912] CURRENT LITERATURE 25I a volume which has just appeared from the pen of A. PUTTER,2 a student of VERWORN'S, associated with him at Bonn. PUTTER'S book will be especially interesting to physiologists who have entered the science through studies with plants, partly because the author states in his preface that PFEFFER'S Pfianzen- physiologie "exerted the most lasting influence upon his scientific develop- ment," and still more because of the freedom and general efficiency with which he incorporated numerous fasts and principles of plant physiology in his treatise. There has not appeared previously a book of readable size, which is so truly a comparative physiology as is the present volume. About one- fourth of the figures are taken from plant material. Having announced in his introduction that the study of all life-processes is the field of physiology, and that an understanding of these processes is to be obtained only by comparison, the emphasis being laid upon points of simi- larity in various organisms rather than upon those of difference, PUTTER proceeds to discuss, with many citations of the more recent literature, the following nine topics, which form the chapter headings of the book before us (i) The substratum of the life processes, (ii) Metabolism, (iii) Nutrition, (iv) Exchange of material, (v) Conditions of life, (vi) Energy transformations, (vii) Responses to stimuli, (viii) Organs of perception, (ix) Nervous system. In the first chapter, under "The physical constitution of living substance," the author gives a brief but clear presentation of these aspects of colloidal chemistry, an understanding of which is most necessary to physiological thinking. Under "The constituents of organisms," he discusses water and the various groups of chemical compounds that find a place in living beings. The point is well made that water is to be considered as fundamental to all life, and it is shown that, in general, the water content of the active parts of plants and animals may be taken to be about the same. In the following chapters, of which spatial limitations prevent any con- sideration here, the author's treatment of the various processes and activities of organisms is always carried out from the standpoint of physics and chemis- try, at least the methods of these sciences in attacking a problem are here always evident. Anthropomorphic terms and ways of viewing life-processes are rarely admitted and only with proper logical consideration. The aim is always to arrive as nearly as possible at the underlying principles according to which the different processes go forward, to bring out the cause of each effect and the quantitative relations which exist between these. The book empha- sizes in a gratifying and encouraging way the considerable degree to which the simpler mathematical expressions of physical science are already being incor- porated in physiological reasoning. While every reader will find certain points wherein he and the author may disagree, we have found the volume exceptionally logical in its generalizations 2 PtTTER, A., Vergleichende Physiologie. pp. Viii+721. figs.

What might be considered as errors or inadequacies of treatment are no doubt largely explainable on grounds of lack of space for a full consideration of the questions involved. It is not likely that the book will lead any serious worker far astray.-B. E. LIVINGSTON.</page></plain_text>
