THERE is an ever-growing mass of literature on the subject of bird distribution, but it is almost without exception purely descriptive. It seems to have been assumed that one of three essentials, suitable climatic conditions, sufficient food, or a safe nesting place, is limiting the bird directly, although almost no investigations have been made to determine which of these factors might be concerned in a particular case. Perhaps the most important contribution is that of Palmgren (1930), who tackles the problem from an ecological point of view based on most careful and detailed observations, but is in most cases unable to explain satisfactorily the bird distribution by means of these factors.</page><page sequence="2">Habitat Selection in Birds The recent afforestation of the Breckland heaths with pines affords an interesting experiment in this respect. In an attempt to explain the observed distributions, the inadequacy of the above three essential factors was at once apparent, and it was necessary to introduce a new factor of a psycho- logical nature, the importance of which has not previously been realised. An exception occurs to some extent in the work of Brock (1914), whose interesting discussion on the ecological relations of bird distribution has not attracted the attention it deserves. The investigation of the Breckland avifauna was due in the first place to the suggestion of Dr A. Watt, of the Cambridge University Forestry School, who has been greatly interested in the floristic and faunistic changes which the afforestation has been producing. I am indebted to him for much helpful advice, for obtaining permission for me to work in the area, and for supplying me with a map of the new plantations. I am also deeply indebted to Charles Elton, N. B. Kinnear, Dr H. L. Lack, Dr T. G. Longstaff, and Dr W. H. Thorpe for their many helpful suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript. PART I. THE BRECKLAND AVIFAUNA. (1) Botanical description. The Breckland is an area of sandy heaths on the borders of Norfolk and Suffolk, the areas worked being close to Thetford and Brandon. The locality names used are those of the one-inch Ordnance Survey Map of Thetford for 1914, the old names of the heaths and warrens now afforested being retained. Farrow (1925) describes the plant communities of the Breckland, and stresses the importance of rabbit attack as a factor in their distribution. From the ornithological standpoint a brief classification suffices for the areas worked: (1) Grass heath. Grasses (Festuca ovina and Agrostis vulgaris) the chief plants. (a) Closely grazed turf with much bare sand; rabbits extremely common, e.g. Little Heath near Larling. (b) The grass longer and flowering; rabbits much less common, e.g. much of Lakenheath Warren. (2) Grass with bracken. The commonest heath type in the areas worked. (a) Both grass and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) of poor growth, e.g. parts of Lakenheath Warren where bracken was sparse and only knee high. (b) Much richer growth, e.g. Brettenham Heath where bracken was often over waist high. Occasional deciduous bushes or trees, usually birch (Betula), had grown up in some of these areas. (3) Heather heath. Much less common than grass heath in the areas worked, and pure heather (Calluna vulgaris) was rare, bracken and at times grass being mixed with it, e.g. Roudham and Bridgeham Heaths. (4) Afforested areas. The areas, first cleared of rabbits, have been planted with pines, mainly the Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris), in long rows some 4-8 ft. apart with occasional rides. 240</page><page sequence="3">The ground vegetation was fairly thick grass and bracken, with heather at times. The planta- tions of the same year were of variable thickness, and some of those first selected for obser- vation proved of exceptionally poor growth; the results from these have been kept distinct. Even the best grown plantations did not retain uniform thickness over large areas, but the chief thinner patches could be avoided. Save that the 19261 plantation at West Tofts had grown exceptionally well (it proved as thick as any 1925 plantations observed), the thickest plantation of each year appeared to have grown at a fairly equal rate, so far as this could be estimated by allowing for the intervening years' growth. In P. 27 (four years old at the time of observation) the pines were some 4 ft. high. In P. 25 (six years old) they were often 8 ft. in height and the lower lateral branches of neighbouring trees overlapped. In P. 22 (nine years old) the trees rose to over 12 ft. and the lateral branches of neighbouring trees inter- locked so as to make many places almost impenetrable. The surrounding ground vegetation did not seem as yet to have been significantly affected by the trees. The examples of the different plantations worked are given in Appendix I. P. 22 is the oldest in Thetford Chase. (2) Method of observation and recording. The main observations were made between June 19th and 27th, 19312. This was unavoidably a little late in the year, but most pairs of birds still held breeding territories, and any young which had left the nest were usually distinguishable from adults. The observer walked steadily through the areas selected, recording every, breeding pair of birds seen on either side within some 20 yards. At least two counts were taken in each type of country, the sub- sequent counts being over fresh ground as distant as possible from the first to minimise the influence of local irregularities of distribution. No counts were taken on the edges of areas, since here the population might be affected by the type of vegetation adjoining. This method admittedly gives only approximate figures, but these are sufficiently accurate for the purpose. The actual counts are given in Appendix I. For comparing the populations of different areas the number of pairs of each species is expressed as a per- centage of the total bird population. No percentages are based on a total population under thirty-five pairs save for the P. 27 at Bromehill (eighteen pairs), while most refer to over fifty pairs. This percentage method was designed to give comparative figures. The total bird population densities could only have been estimated with extreme difficulty, and then only approximately. For simplicity, birds are referred to by their popular names, the Latin names of all species in the text being given in Appendix III. (3) Distribution of the birds. Tables I, II, III summarise the effects of the afforestation on the bird life. Table I shows how the species met on typical heath land have been steadily replaced by a new avifauna, members of which first appeared in the 1 The year refers to the year of planting. In future the abbreviations, P. 28 to P. 22, are used for plantations of the years 1928 to 1922 respectively. 2 The main plantations were counted again from June 9th to 12th, 1933.

All the common breeding species have been included (see Appendix I for full data) but the following were omitted as their occurrences were too few and irregular: Common and Red- legged Partridges (both decreasing as the trees grew up), Pheasant (increasing as the trees grew up), Linnet, Lesser Redpoll, and Mistle Thrush (possibly breeding in older plantations, but not proved), and Yellow and Reed Buntings, Wood Lark, Tree Pipit, Yellow Wagtail, Sedge Warbler, Grasshopper Warbler, Robin, Cuckoo and Nightjar. Also the Ringed Plover, found locally on sandy heaths, was not met in the areas worked. Counts in plantations younger than P. 27 are omitted. The birds here were those of the ground vegetation. five-year-old plantations, assumed a majority two years later and were present to the almost complete exclusion of the original avifauna two years after this. Thus in about five years the avifauna has changed almost completely in character. Table II is the same in an expanded form. In Table II the types of vegetation have been arranged in an order of increasing height (which is at times at variance with the age of the plantations). There were marked changes in bird distribution in the series of four heath types given, Wheatear, Stock Dove, Stone Curlew and Lapwing dying out, while Stonechat and Whinchat, which were absent from the barest heaths, increased. In the thickest bracken a few Whitethroat and Wren were found. The plantations continue this series. The two most marked features were the steady decrease of Skylark and Meadow Pipit (which had already begun in thick bracken) and the appearance and rapid increase of the Willow Warbler. Stonechat and Whinchat at first increased, reached their maximum in the 243 Journ. of Animal Ecology IT 16</page><page sequence="6">244 Habitat Selection in Birds four- and five-year-old plantations, and then decreased. The Whitethroat and Wren appeared in the five-year-old plantations and became a little commoner in older plantations.

The Willow Warbler was evidently at its maximum in the eight- and nine-year-old plantations, and has now begun to decrease, while the more recent arrivals, Blackbird, Goldcrest, Chaffinch and Song Thrush, are tending to increase. The other plantations bear out the main conclusions of 1931, and show that the changes previously described occur in each individual plantation as the trees grow higher. The discrepancies observed when plantations of the same age are compared for the two years are due mainly to differences in the rate of growth of the trees, which was at times very marked. This especially applied to the continued exceptional growth of the P. 26 at West Tofts, where Blackbird, Song Thrush and Chaffinch were recorded in 1933, although no six-year-old plantation in 1931 had these species. It must be noted that the distribution of the birds was always irregular. Only when large areas are considered are the changes really apparent. For- tunately, as can be seen from the tables, the changes in distribution occurred extremely rapidly, a new fauna having colonised and an older one died out within five years. Also, in 1933, where much of an eight-year-old plantation had been burnt down three years before, the original heath fauna of Skylark, Meadow Pipit, Stonechat and Whinchat was found to be present in normal strength, having recolonised within this time. However, there was a slight lag in both the disappearance and the colonisa- tion of species. For example, the Stone Curlew persisted to breed in plantations five and six years old, haunts with higher vegetation than that normal to the species. Also the most recent forms to colonise the plantations were sometimes irregular in their appearance, having not yet appeared in certain plantations apparently as suited to them as those in which they did occur. Thus, in 1931, P. 22 and P. 23 afforded very similar conditions, but the Blackbird was present only in P. 22, the Chaffinch only in P. 23. By 1933 both had appeared in each. The few more mature Breckland pinewoods gave little idea of the future avifauna of the afforested areas, since they were too few and small, often rather open, and usually contained some deciduous trees. The Chaffinch was much the commonest species, and the Goldcrest, Coal and Marsh Tits also occurred, with others. The Willow Warbler was scarce, and found only round the more open spaces. Three or even two centuries ago the Breckland was a sandy and treeless waste, so that a number of the heath birds must have colonised fairly recently, while some members of the older fauna, including the Great Bustard, have vanished. Further, owing to extensive game pre- servation in the neighbourhood, birds of prey are now almost extinct, and hence the small Passerine birds are perhaps more abundant than they would otherwise be. The avifauna of the heaths at present seems relatively static, but in the areas with more mature trees colonisation by such species as Wood Lark and Crossbill seems to be still taking place. 16-2 245</page><page sequence="9">Habitat Selection in Birds The above is only a summary of bird distribution on the Breckland and the changes due to afforestation. Where of special interest, further details will be found in the following discussion. PART II. FACTORS LIMITING DISTRIBUTION. The rapidity of the changes in the avifauna resulting from the afforestation of the heaths indicates that the immigrants, especially the Willow Warbler, were abundant in the surrounding country and were kept back from spreading only by lack of suitable habitats. The two most obvious factors concerned in the changes in distribution are food and nesting requirements. A third, that of enemies, can be ruled out, since man has destroyed almost all the bird and egg-eating animals of the district. (1) Species limited by nesting requirements. The Wheatear was common on the open heaths, where it was found nesting exclusively down rabbit burrows. It did not occur in the afforested areas, which, being rabbit proof, were devoid of burrows. But the bird was once found breeding in a four-year-old, and once in a five-year-old plantation, both of which seemed typical save that an old burrow had persisted. These cases show that the young plantations were otherwise suitable and that nesting requirements alone limited the bird's distribution. The same presumably applies to the Stock Dove, which also nested in rabbit burrows on the open heaths, but was not found in the young plantations. A pair of Coal Tits was found feeding recently fledged young in a seven-year-old plantation, and a pair of Marsh Tits was similarly employed in an eight-year-old plantation. This showed that, as one would expect from the birds' known habits, such areas were suitable with regard to food. But neither species nested in any young plantation. Since they appeared as soon as nesting was finished, this was clearly due to absence of the usual nesting sites, holes in trees or banks, of which there were none in the young plantations. This explanation could be tested experimentally by putting up artificial nesting boxes and seeing if the birds then colonised the plantations. This has not been done here. But nesting boxes have been put up in the young pine plantations of the Stadtwald of Frankfurt-on-Maine and here, in 1929, the writer found the Coal Tit breeding. It nested only in the boxes, thus confirming the conclusion that young pine plantations are suited to this species save for the normal lack of nesting sites. The Meadow Pipit, common on every other heath, was absent from the bare rabbit-grazed Little Heath where its usual associate, the Skylark, re- mained common. Nesting requirements perhaps explain this, the former selecting rather thick ground vegetation, the latter much more open ground. In no further case were nesting requirements thought to be limiting dis- tribution. 246</page><page sequence="10">DAVID LACK Where nesting requirements limit distribution it is commonly supposed that the limit is an absolute one, that no safe nesting place is available. Actually in the above cases (and probably in most others) the limit is due to the stereotyped nature of the bird's behaviour. There is nothing else to prevent the Wheatear from nesting in thick vegetation, which is the normal habit of the closely related Stonechat and Whinchat, or the Coal Tit from building a nest on a fir branch, or the Meadow Pipit from nesting in such bare places as the Skylark. It is because their accustomed, not because all, nesting sites are absent that they disappear or fail to colonise. This lack of adaptability is in keeping with the fundamentally instinctive nature of bird behaviour. On the shingle area of Dungeness, Kent, where the Wheatear's usual nesting sites are absent, the bird does occur, nesting under derelict metal objects, and occasionally among the roots of a gorse bush, or in a depression in the open (Ticehurst, 1909). In this area, which has existed a great many years, the bird's habit has become modified, rendering colonisation possible. Hence on occasion the usual nesting site may be modified, but such cases are rare. This occurrence is of special interest since the bird has not, as yet, modified its habits in this direction on the Breckland, though it would be advantageous for it to do so. (2) Tree Pipit. The Tree Pipit occurred regularly in open heath country identical with that frequented by the closely allied Meadow Pipit provided one or more fairly tall trees were present. Owing to this last condition it was absent from many localities where the Meadow Pipit was abundant. What factor could cause this? Nesting requirements are ruled out, being identical with those of the Meadow Pipit. Both nest on the ground. Nor was the Tree Pipit observed feeding in trees, and analyses of the food from various parts of England (Jourdain, 1920) show the requirements of both species to be the same. Protection from enemies is ruled out since both species nest and roost on the ground, and in any case appear to have no enemies on the Breckland. One cannot postulate physiological or other adaptations of the species to their slightly different environments, since the difference at times rests solely in the presence of a single tree, occupying but a small part of the breeding area. Further, in a treeless part of Cambridgeshire, the writer found a pair of Tree Pipits breeding close to a telegraph pole. The only use to which the tree, and in the last case the pole, is put by the Tree Pipit is as a perch to which to fly down towards the end of its aerial song. The Meadow Pipit has a very similar song but normally ends it on the ground. To ornithologists imbued with teleological views of bird distribution, it may seem surprising that the Tree Pipit should be prevented from colonising the Breckland heaths solely through a psychological requirement, correlated with the singing habit, for a tall tree. But this is in keeping with the instinctive 247</page><page sequence="11">Habitat Selection in Birds nature of bird behaviour commented on in the last section. Singing is an important part of bird behaviour. That a bird should be unable to modify its habits in this direction is little more remarkable than its failure to do so with regard to its nesting site demonstrated previously. (3) Willow Warbler. The Willow Warbler, normally absent from the Breckland heaths, colonised the young plantations when these were five years old, increased rapidly, and was the commonest bird in the seven- to nine-year-old plantations. What requirement, absent from the heaths, was supplied by the young plantations? On the traditional view of bird distribution one might suppose this factor to have been thick cover (for moving in which the bird seems well adapted), nesting sites, and/or suitable food, all of which might be different in the young plantations from what they were on the heaths. Actually it proved to be none of these. Though absent from most heaths, the Willow Warbler occurred on a number of the most thickly vegetated ones where a bush (usually a birch or thorn) 5 ft. or more in height, and often isolated, had sown itself. The sur- rounding heath was quite typical and here the bird nested (i.e. away from the bush) and obtained the great bulk, if not all, of its food. The bush was used mainly for singing from, but the male spent much of his time there, perhaps even feeding, though the supply from the bush could not have been significant. The latter cases show that the Willow Warbler could exist on the thickly vegetated heaths so far as food and nesting requirements were concerned. Only the scarcity of a taller bush had prevented it from spreading over such areas. It was clearly only this last essential that the young plantations supplied. Hence, as in the previous cases, distribution was limited by a psychological requirement. This was correlated with the singing habit, though perhaps not exclusively, since the Willow Warbler frequented its tree at other times also. It may be noted that the young plantations introduce a new insect fauna. An analysis of the food of the Willow Warblers breeding in the plantations would probably have shown the presence of insects not found on the heaths. The above discussion shows the fallacy of concluding from this that the heaths could not supply the Willow Warbler with suitable food. (4) Reed and Yellow Buntings. The Reed and Yellow Buntings are two species of the same genus both common on the Breckland, the former in marshy districts, the latter in drier districts, along the hedgerows and the edges of heaths, etc. The two showed almost no overlap of habitat. What factor or factors caused this marked difference? The nesting sites of the two species seemed similar, both being in thick vegetation on or slightly above the ground. Their breeding habits seemed similar. So far as known neither possessed structural or other adaptations to 248</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY VOL. 2, PLATE IX Photo. David Lack Phot. 3. Fairly well-grown P. 25. Six years old. (Pinus sylvestris.) Photo. David Lack Phot. 4. Well-grown P. 23. Eight years old. (Pinus sylvestris.) LACK-HABITAT SELECTION IN BIRDS Face p. 248</page><page sequence="13">DAVID LACK its particular habitat. The food of the two species is mainly vegetable, especially seeds, while in summer insects of many orders are taken. The sole difference is that the Reed Bunting mainly eats marsh plants and insects, the Yellow Bunting mainly those of drier situations (Jourdain, 1920). Since both have such a varied diet one cannot suppose that so slight a difference, even if appreciable to the birds (which is doubtful), could cause such a marked differ- ence in distribution. It seems clear that both species utilise the food that happens to be commonest in their respective habitats. The situation was made more remarkable by the discovery of one pair of Reed Buntings which successfully reared a family on Brettenham Heath in a typical Yellow Bunting habitat several miles from any marsh. This renders it extremely improbable that there existed even slight adaptive, including physiological, differences between the two species (whose presence would be hard to ascertain); and that such factors, acting through an intensive com- petition, have produced the present distribution. There therefore seems nothing in the environment to compel the difference in distribution. The remaining possibility is a psychological factor. In the species previously considered a psychological limit could be correlated with a definite part of the bird's behaviour. In the present case there were no differences in the behaviour of the two species which could be correlated with differences in the habitats. The only remaining possibility is to suppose that the Reed Bunting, returning to its breeding ground in spring, instinctively selects its ancestral habitat, a marsh, the Yellow Bunting selecting drier ground for the same reason. The last is really not at all an improbable hypothesis, though it does not seem to have been advanced in connection with bird distribution before, save that Brock (1914, p. 41) clearly had a psychological factor in mind in his "environmental bias." Hereditary instinct controls the design of the bird's nest, the materials used, and the site adopted, each species adhering to its own particular type, though the differences between closely related species cannot be explained teleologically. When instinct controls such matters, it would indeed be surprising if it did not control the type of ground selected by the bird for a breeding territory. To this instinctive selection by the bird of the type of habitat frequented by its ancestors, the term habitat selection will be given. It must be noted that the process of selection is considered instinctive. "Selection" has unfortunate anthropomorphic associations but no better term seems available. "Habitat preference" is open to the same objection, and further has been used by many writers (not only with regard to birds) in a much more general sense. In winter the Reed and Yellow Buntings are usually in flocks scattered about the countryside. In early spring they return to the breeding grounds and the males take up prominent positions and sing (Howard, 1929). Although the birds are very mobile they do not at this season appear in every sort of 249</page><page sequence="14">Habitat Selection in Birds habitat, to give it a trial. Each species returns to its typical habitat, to account for which one must postulate the existence of habitat selection, that the birds can (instinctively) recognise their typical habitat. If the difference in distribution between Reed and Yellow Bunting is due to the existence of specific habitat selection, the exceptional occurrence of a pair of the former in the habitat of the latter must be considered due to an aberration from the normal behaviour. Such are well known to occur occasionally with regard to other instincts, such as nest-building. The occurrence does not invalidate the hypothesis of habitat selection. On the other hand, had the restriction of the Reed Bunting to marshes been due to the direct influence of an environmental factor, such an incident would be extremely difficult to explain. (5) Other species of the young plantations. The changes in bird distribution due to the growth of the young pines on the heaths have been described. Lack of space prevents a detailed analysis for each species, and some, for which the data obtained were insufficient to warrant any conclusions, will be omitted. Nesting requirements, apart from the few cases mentioned earlier, do not seem to have been the cause of any of the changes. Nesting sites typical of those normally selected by Stone Curlew, Lapwing, Skylark, Meadow Pipit, Stonechat, Whinchat, Common and Red-legged Partridge were still afforded by the young plantations after these species had disappeared. Nesting sites typical of those normally selected by Willow Warbler, Dunnock, Blackbird, Song Thrush, Goldcrest, Chaffinch, Robin and Pheasant (and probably Whitethroat and Wren) were available before (i.e. at a younger stage than) these species colonised. With regard to food, while it is obvious that a bird must have a sufficient quantity of readily available food, the importance of its quality seems to have been greatly exaggerated by ornithologists. It has frequently been assumed that a species is limited to a particular habitat because its normal food seems similarly restricted. Brock (1914) pointed out the fallacy in this, but his statement has been ignored. Thus Coward (1928), discussing the dis- tribution of the Sedge Warbler, says "the presence of water in lake, small pond, river, ditch or marsh, is all it requires for it feeds upon gnats, midges and other dipterous flies whose early life is aquatic." Numerous similar statements could be cited. In most such cases at least the analyses have been insufficient to show that the distribution of the food was restricted to the habitat of the bird. Were this proved, it would then be necessary to show that the bird refuses to take the types of food available to it beyond the borders of its habitat, which seems never to have been attempted. Further, there is now considerable evidence that most birds have an extremely varied diet; see, for example, Jourdain (1920), McAtee (1932). Food preferences undoubtedly exist in birds, as shown for instance by Mottram (1918), but present evidence is in favour of 250</page><page sequence="15">DAVID LACK supposing that they are readily broken through and hence are unimportant in limiting distribution. Exceptions to this probably occur in birds adapted for obtaining very special types of food, but such seem to be rare. With regard to the Breckland birds, stomach analyses would of course show that the Skylark and Meadow Pipit were eating mainly the insects of the heaths; Willow Warbler, Blackbird, Goldcrest and others mainly those of the plantations. This proves nothing more than that each species feeds on the commonest available insects in its habitat. Analyses of the food of the species concerned (Jourdain, 1920) show it to be extremely varied, insects of almost every sort, some other invertebrates, and a variety of vegetable matter being taken by each. It therefore seems unlikely that the insects of the young plantations would be less acceptable than those of the heaths to the birds of the latter, or that the birds of the plantations, especially with the proved case of the Willow Warbler before one, would find the insects of the heath unsuitable. The following cases further suggest, if they do not prove, that food was not concerned. The Common and Red-legged Partridge decreased, the Pheasant increased, as the plantations grew up. Their food is said to be similar. The Chiffchaff was never recorded from the young plantations, though its food does not differ significantly from that of the closely allied Willow Warbler. The Whinchat and Stonechat were common on the most thickly vegetated heaths; they were somewhat more common in the four- and five-year-old plantations, but decreased in those older than this. Any new food introduced by the young pines could not have been the cause of both the increase and the decrease. Again, it seems unlikely that there should have been insufficient food for the Goldcrest in the seven-year-old and younger plantations, when there was sufficient in the eight-year-old which were merely a little taller. Stone Curlew, also Meadow Pipit, tended to linger on in the young plantations though the habitat was no longer that normal to the species (presumably due to the habit demonstrated in many birds of returning each year to breed in the same place). That such birds could rear their young successfully indicates that the food supply was still sufficient, and hence was presumably not concerned in the disappearance of their fellows. Lastly, the Song Thrush was sometimes observed feeding on the heaths, showing that the latter could supply at least a part of its diet. In conclusion, although food is clearly important in controlling the density of the whole bird population in any area, in not a single case on the Breckland was there evidence for supposing that it limited the distribution of any particular species. * * * * * * * From the changes in distribution which occurred it is apparent that the birds were affected far more by the height of the vegetation than by its nature. This is shown specially well in the Stonechat and Whinchat, which were 251</page><page sequence="16">Habitat Selection in Birds equally common in vegetation of similar height whether this was bracken or young pines. This suggests strongly that once again one is dealing with a psychological factor. The particular height (within limits) of the vegetation does not seem to affect any of the birds' essential requirements, but in some cases it is correlated with particular habits. Thus the Stonechat and Whinchat use the tops of the vegetation as perches from which to sing and to make aerial flights after food. Their nests, however, are on, or close to, the ground. The Blackbird sings and nests well off the ground, so in these habits the height of the vegetation may be significant, but it feeds on the ground. In various other species nesting, singing, feeding, and other activities can be correlated with the height of the vegetation. In no case does the correlation seem more than a psychological one. Thus, so far as one can see, no disadvantage would be incurred if the Stonechat sang on the ground and the Blackbird nested there (which is the normal habit in certain close relatives of each species). In many cases, however, the dependence of distribution on the height of the vegetation cannot be correlated with any particular habit, this especially applying to species disappearing as the vegetation grows higher. The Skylark, for instance, sings in the air and nests and feeds on the ground. These are, in essentials, unchanged in young plantations from which the bird has vanished. The same applies to the Stonechat which nests on the ground, feeds in the air from a perch (and also on the ground), and sings from a perch. These are still supplied in young plantations from which the bird has gone. Many similar cases could be cited. Through the complete inadequacy of other factors one has to postulate, as in the case of Reed and Yellow Buntings, the existence of specific habitat selection. The arguments brought forward for its existence in these species, based on the immediate adoption of the typical habitat in spring, apply to these other species also. Now, selection of the ancestral habitat implies recognition, and one would therefore expect habitat selection to be correlated with the conspicuous features of the habitat. The height of the vegetation is certainly one of the most conspicuous features of the habitat on the Breckland, and the close dependence of distribution on it, irrespective of whether it was correlated with any essential avian requirements, is just what one would expect if distribution was being limited through habitat selection. The nature of a bird's normal habitat, i.e. that determined by habitat selection, can be estimated only by studying its distribution over a wide area. The distributions on the Breckland certainly conform with tlhe known dis- tributions of the species elsewhere in Britain. Thus the complete absence of the Chiffchaff from the young plantations can scarcely be explained save on habitat selection, for the bird is almost identical in size, plumage, habits, and food requirements with the Willow Warbler, which is the commonest bird in the plantations. The Chiffchaff frequents somewhat taller vegetation than the Willow Warbler throughout Britain. Again, the Pheasant increases, 252</page><page sequence="17">DAVID LACK the Common and Red-legged Partridges decrease, as the plantations grow up, which can scarcely be explained save on habitat selection, since their food, nesting habits, adaptation to running, etc., are so similar. Throughout Britain, the former frequents woods, the two latter open ground. Again, the Meadow Pipit and Stone Curlew frequent open country throughout Britain; their disappearance from the young plantations must surely be due to habitat selection, not to a direct effect of the environment, since those which lingered on (through another instinct, that of returning to breed in the same place each year) were able to thrive. (6) Ringed Plover. The case of the Ringed Plover is exceptional. The bird was breeding on a few of the barest sandy heaths, but was not found where the vegetation grew at all thickly. Its absence from the latter areas could not well be correlated with its essential nesting requirements or its adaptation to running, and it seems unlikely that food supply could have been concerned. Habitat selection could account for it, however, since the bird is normally restricted to bare sand and shingle (but on the foreshore). Since the Ringed Plover normally frequents the foreshore, its presence inland on the Breckland requires explanation. Certain coastal plants, insects, and mollusca are also found on the Breckland which, with the sandy nature of the terrain, show that the area was originally one of coastal sand dunes which later became cut off from the sea. The changes evidently proceeded sufficiently slowly for the Ringed Plover not to be driven away. This may be compared with the Stone Curlew and Meadow Pipit, which lingered on in the young plantations for a short while, but here the changes in habitat were evidently far too rapid to produce any permanent modification. The habitat preference of the Ringed Plover has been modified only locally. It does not normally frequent the sandy inland heaths of Britain, although to-day these seem to offer the same conditions as those in which it occurs on the Breckland. Lonnberg (1932) describes a number of wading birds which, normally coastal, are similarly "relict" inland in Central Asia. Here also, only the past history of the area explains their occurrence. (7) Summary of Part II. Various species limited by nesting requirements show the importance of the psychological factor in bird distribution. This is further emphasised by the absence of certain species from areas otherwise suitable which did not supply them with a singing perch. In many other species a consideration of the birds' essential requirements failed to account for the limits of distribution, nor could a psychological factor correlated with a definite habit provide explana- tion. It was necessary to introduce the idea that each species instinctively 253</page><page sequence="18">Habitat Selection in Birds selects its ancestral habitat, the evidence for the existence of habitat selection being based on the following points: (1) Other factors were completely inadequate to account for more than a few cases of distribution on the Breckland. (2) There is strong likelihood that in so highly organised an animal as a bird such a mechanism would exist. (3) In spring when birds take up their breeding quarters, they normally appear straight away in the typical habitat. Had there been no habitat selection, one would have expected them to attempt to breed in other habitats. (4) Distribution on the Breckland frequently depended on the conspicuous features of the habitat, irrespective of whether these were correlated with the birds' essential requirements. Habitat selection implies recognition of the typical habitat, which one would expect to depend on its conspicuous features. (5) Rarely a bird broke away from its ancestral habitat and bred with apparent success elsewhere. This affords the best evidence that a bird's restriction to its habitat is psychological. Just as the nesting of the Wheatear on Dungeness in the open shows its normal selection of a hole to be due to habit, so the presence of the Ringed Plover on the Breckland heaths shows its normal restriction to the foreshore to be due not to environmental necessity but to a psychological factor, i.e. instinctive habitat selection. PART III. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF HABITAT SELECTION. (1) Features on which it depends. The height of the vegetation is of course by no means the only feature of the environment correlated with habitat selection, which may clearly depend on a number of features. In the Reed and Yellow Buntings the field data did not permit analysis. In other species discussed in Part II the influence of the height of the vegetation could be isolated from other features, hence its prominence in the discussion. It is obvious also that two species may occur in the same locality because of very different features; for instance, both the ground-frequenting Meadow Pipit and the Goldcrest occurred in an eight- year-old pine plantation. (2) Relation to particular habits. The distribution of the Tree Pipit was limited by the presence of a tall tree. This could be correlated with the singing habit, but the bird sometimes descends to the ground instead of to a tree when singing, and it seems better to consider the limitation as due rather to habitat selection, perhaps strengthened by the close association of the tree with a particular habit. This is brought out by the birds, mentioned later in Part II, in which the height of the vegetation could be correlated with more than one habit, while in most it was correlated with no particular habit, though still the important factor in dis- 254</page><page sequence="19">DAVID LACK tribution. Instincts govern the bird's selection of all its requirements, nesting site, nesting material, food, etc. These instincts will be satisfied in the normal habitat. It is only under unusual conditions, such as a heath with no rabbit burrows, or a pine wood with no holes in the trees, that these instincts, rather than habitat selection, limit distribution. The situation is of course different in the many birds (unrepresented in the areas worked) whose feeding and nesting habitats are quite distinct, such as the cliff-nesting sea-birds. Probably in these forms one can no longer speak of a general habitat selection, since the activities correlated with nesting, and those correlated with feeding, refer to separate areas. Such cases are to be discussed in a future paper. (3) Biological advantage. Instances have been given where the existence of habitat selection pre- vented a bird from colonising, or caused its disappearance from, an area where it could have bred successfully. But although it restricts distribution, habitat selection insures a suitable habitat (the ancestral one). A bird has no means of knowing whether any other habitat would or would not be suitable to it. Habitat selection replaces the chance dispersal found in many primitive animals, in which the individual may happen on a suitable habitat but often does not. (4) Breaking away from the ancestral habitat1. The freak occurrence of the Reed Bunting on a heath, the lingering of Meadow Pipit and Stone Curlew in the young plantations, and the presence of the Ringed Plover inland on the Breckland show that a bird may break away from its habitat-selection instinct. But such cases are rare. The Green Wood- pecker shows particularly well the difficulty birds have in breaking away from the ancestral habitat. This species, though specialised like all Woodpeckers for climbing and feeding on tree trunks, has so far broken away from the ancestral habit as to feed on the ground, especially round ant hills. However, it still returns to a tree trunk to nest. Hence it has not, as yet, spread into the tree- less areas which its altered feeding habits would have made suitable. The species which have colonised human dwellings and agricultural land are of special interest with regard to breaking away from the ancestral habitat. This subject is too large to be discussed here, but it may be noted that in some cases at least there need have been very little modification. From the bird's stand- point, if not our own, the new habitat may be similar to the ancestral. 1 Observations made with B. B. Roberts in Iceland in 1933, to be published later, somewhat modify this section. It was found where more birds were available than their typical habitat could provide for, that they became less restricted in the type of breeding ground which they selected. Hence one should probably speak rather of the modification of a habitat preference than of the breaking away from the type of the ancestral habitat. 255</page><page sequence="20">Habitat Selection in Birds (5) Influence on density of population. The influence of habitat selection on the density of the bird population is another subject which can be but briefly mentioned. Its importance was well shown in the five-year-old plantation at West Tofts. This seemed a fairly uniform habitat, but in the more open parts the Meadow Pipit and Skylark were the commonest birds, the Willow Warbler being scarce, whereas in the taller and thicker parts this distribution was reversed. Intermediately, Stonechat and Whinchat were the commonest types. Thus, as a result of their differing habitat preferences, the distribution of the birds varied very appre- ciably in a habitat which, the trees being all of the same age, exhibited a greater uniformity than that of many natural environments. It is this factor which, as pointed out by Elton (1932) and Longstaff (1932), renders density estimations from a bird census of such doubtful scientific value. (6) Habitat selection and evolution1. The distribution of Breckland birds seems explicable only on the assump- tion that each species selects its ancestral habitat, recognising it by conspicuous features. It remains to consider why different species should select different habitats; in particular why closely allied species should so often select similar but distinct habitats, which adjoin but scarcely overlap. The-Meadow, Tree and Rock Pipits are cases in point; the Yellow and Reed Buntings another. Indeed it seems a widespread phenomenon among Passerine birds in Northern Europe, although in England it often tends to be obscured by the influence of man, who has modified a habitat so that it satisfies the requirements of more than one species. Thus the Mistle and Song Thrushes both frequent gardens in England, but in their unmodified haunts in Central Europe the writer found them in separate habitats. While admitting that habitat selection controls the distribution to-day, through ability to recognise the ancestral habitat, one might consider that the original reason for the differences in distribution were correlated with adapta- tions, adaptations which still exist but which do not meet the eye. Against this is that in not a single case, so far as the writer knows, has differential adaptation to the respective habitats been proved between closely allied species of Passerines. It is a very big assumption that in every case these adaptations exist but are too small to be appreciated, and in such cases as that of the Tree and Meadow Pipit the idea of differential adaptation, at least as applied to the Breckland distribution, seems untenable. If there is no differential adaptation to the different habitats an explanation 1 This section, like most of the paper, refers to Passerine birds, the order to which most of the Breckland species belong. Some European Seabirds, Ducks and Waders are to be discussed in a later paper on Icelandic birds. In the Ducks at least, the situation seems very different from that here set forth for the Passerines. 256</page><page sequence="21">DAVID LACK is still possible. Consider a species whose range included two types of habitat which, while presenting the same essential requirements, differed markedly in their appearance; for instance, a Pipit frequenting bare meadow land and also similar meadow land with large trees. The conspicuous features (those correlated with habitat selection) are different and, since distribution depends on habitat selection, one could conceive that the individuals breeding in each type of habitat would tend to select the same one when they returned in spring. In this way two groups might become isolated, and eventually split into two species (i.e. Meadow and Tree Pipits). In the North Temperate regions the habitats of closely allied species of Passerines often afford the same essential requirements but differ markedly in their appearance. The view that such species have become segregated from each other through differential habitat selection is admittedly hypothetical, but would explain this and also the absence of differential adaptations to the respective habitats. The im- portance of isolation in the production of species is widely recognised, and the existence of habitat selection suggests how isolation could be effected between forms whose geographical range coincided. Not only do different species of the same genus seem to live in the different types of the same sort of habitat, but the same is observed when higher groups are compared. Thus the Pipits and Warblers occupy distinct but adjoining habitats, suggesting that they and other families of Passerine birds also became separated by a division of the habitat which belonged to their common ancestor. Among higher groups the division is often less sharp. There has been longer time for modification to occur (for habitat preferences, though strong, are occasionally modified, as illustrated earlier) with the result that ranges overlap. Less closely related groups are somewhat differentially adapted to their habitats. The Pipit, for example, seems more adapted to progression in the open, the Warbler in thick cover (but this difference could not, without habitat selection, account for the replacement of the Meadow Pipit by the Willow Warbler in the young fir plantations of the Breckland). Between yet more remotely related forms specialisation may be so marked as to prevent in itself any overlap of habitat. As one would expect, differential specialisation tends to increase the longer the forms have been separated. A serious objection to this view is the apparent absence of species in the making through differential habitat selection. Nor does it seem likely that these have been overlooked. The case of the Cuckoos (Baker, 1923; Jourdain, 1925), which seem to be splitting into races with different host preferences, is scarcely comparable. In the case of geographical isolation among birds there are many sub-specific forms which illustrate the intermediate stages of the process. It may be noted in passing that geographical isolation is in birds rarely produced through an impassable physical barrier, but usually through a psychological factor, the habit so strongly developed in many forms of returning to breed where they were reared in the previous year. Thus one 257</page><page sequence="22">Habitat Selection in Birds geographical race will not infrequently pass regularly on migration through the region where an allied race breeds. In this respect it is comparable to the postulated isolation by habitat selection. To conclude, the view advanced here that specific divergence has at times been achieved through habitat selection is admittedly hypothetical. There is some evidence to favour it, and there are some objections (probably not insurmountable). Until there are more data one cannot prove or disprove it. It was included primarily to show that considerations of evolution and the species problem do not invalidate the habitat-selection hypothesis, which has been formulated to explain present-day distribution. The dis- cussions on the species problem by Richards and Robson (1926), Robson (1928), also Fisher (1931) are of interest with regard to these views concerning birds. (7) Final note on animal distribution. The main object of this paper was to show the importance of the psycho- logical factor in limiting bird distribution. Birds, as a group, are well adapted to a terrestrial environment and can withstand great variation in the climatic conditions. At the same time they have well-developed powers of flight, and hence there are few barriers to their dispersal. In spite of this almost all species of birds have a comparatively restricted breeding range. The reason is apparent from this paper, and is to be found in the possession by the bird of the instinct to select its own breeding ground. This instinct tends to restrict an animal to the locality, and to the type of locality, where its parents proved successful, which promotes segregation, both geographical and of habitat, with the result that species are differentiated, each with a restricted distribution. As remarked by Thompson and Parker (1927), there are many cases where the distribution of an animal has been shown to be limited by some simple factor, such as temperature or moisture, in some instances quantitatively as well as qualitatively; but even though some biological phenomena are re- ducible to definite and constant combinations of certain physico-chemical causes, it is not necessary, or indeed probable, that all should be. This is borne out by their conclusion that the cause of behaviour in host selection by an entomophagous parasite is on a psychological plane, and this paper presents a similar conclusion with regard to the distribution of birds. SUMMARY. 1. The Breckland heaths have been planted with young pines. Until the trees are some four years old only heathland birds occur, but within the next five years these die out, being replaced by a new avifauna. 2. Deficiency of nesting sites explained a few distributions. 3. Food, though clearly important in controlling the total bird population, did not appear to limit the distribution of any species investigated. 258</page><page sequence="23">DAVID LACK 259 4. Most distribution could be explained only by postulating the existence of specific habitat selection-that each species selects its ancestral habitat, instinctively recognising it by the conspicuous, not necessarily the essential, features. The evidence for this is summarised at the end of Part II (see p. 254). 5. Although it restricts distribution, habitat selection ensures a suitable habitat, replacing the chance dispersal of other animals. 6. Birds rarely break away from the ancestral habitatl, at times success- fully. 7. Passerine species of the North Temperate region often tend to occupy distinct but adjoining habitats, affording the same essential requirements but differing in their conspicuous features. No correlated adaptations are apparent, and it is tentatively suggested that in such species segregation has been achieved with the assistance of differential habitat selection. 8. The paper emphasises the importance of the psychological factor, usually ignored, in bird distribution. l See foot-note, p. 255. REFERENCES. Baker, E. C. S. (1923). "Cuckoos' eggs and evolution."
