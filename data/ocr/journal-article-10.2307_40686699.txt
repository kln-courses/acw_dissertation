<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Modern Corporation By Nicholas Wolf son* Public-Private Partnership Edited by Harvey Brooks, Lance Liebman, and Corinne Schelling** Reviewed by Richard W. Duesenberg*** Two recent books take a look at the modern corporation and do it from very different perspectives. Nicholas Wolfson writes about corporations in a concise, tightly reasoned, and analytical way. He lets logic take its course, usually leading to where he would like to go. The other book is a compilation of essays by numerous authors ranging across a comfortably broad philosophical spec- trum, but mostly reflecting many of the attitudes of recent decades. It talks about the corporation often in anthropomorphic terms, putting on it the pants lamented in their absence by a jurist of an earlier century who thought corporations should have a place to be kicked. The thinking in some of the essays is occasionally muddled,1 but the themes are always familiar. Public- Private Partnership is a product of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Its very title sets the tenor of the volume. The idea that a corporation might be an expression of individualism and that the government should be a servant of the individual is not one that persuasively emerges from its pages. Partnership is proffered as the scheme by which peace might be made *New York: The Free Press, 1984 ($25.00). ** Boston: American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1984 ($25.00). ***Mr. Duesenberg is a member of the Missouri bar, senior vice-president, general counsel, and secretary of Monsanto Company in St. Louis, and editor of The Business Lawyer. 1. An example is this statement found in the discussion of urban policy priorities, at page 13: "Private entrepreneurship with profit as the sole purpose is not enough. Projects must be selected with an eye to collective social needs, not simply as the sum of the needs or wants of individuals as consumers." First, "profit" is hardly the "sole purpose" of entrepreneurship in anyone's mind, any more than eating is the sole purpose of living. And what is meant by the distinction apparently drawn between "collective social needs" and "the sum of the needs or wants of individuals as consumers"? They sound pretty much alike, and unless one knows what is in the author's mind when penning these phrases and contrasts, they are annoyingly distracting. This volume of the Academy is laced with such imprécisions of communication. 1535</page><page sequence="2">1536 The Business Lawyer; Vol. 40, August 1985 between perceived competing and antagonistic forces. Many opinions of the body politic are mirrored, which means that something for most everyone is found between its covers. To the credit of its editors, it is not a strident polemic against big corporations, as would be expected were the volume a product from the camps of self-styled "public interest" writers. Public- Private Partnership is divided into five parts: The Public and Private Sectors, Patterns of Public-Private Relations, New Functions for the Corpora- tion?, Opportunities for the 1980s, and Achieving Democratic Legitimacy. The first two parts are largely sociological. Somehow, it does not seem necessary to wade through so much "trade jargon" to conclude: "Community is an important public value, and its loss due to shifts in economic activity is as serious a 'negative externality' of economic growth as environmental pollution or indus- trial accidents or illnesses . . . ."2 Or: "We have a national interest in preserving the health of local or regional economies . . . ."3 Others are more prescient: "The experience with federal urban policy of the last ten or fifteen years has taught us that the system of interrelationships among different aspects of the economy and local communities and neighborhoods is just too complex to be comprehended by any centralized analytical process."4 A major creed of the libertarian is that increased complexity and less centralized planning go hand in hand. It is in part III that the discussion of corporations moves front and center. In his interesting chapter, What Is the Proper Role of the Corporation?, Robert C. Clark starts by identifying five "clusters of views," which he labels dualism, monism, modest idealism, high idealism, and pragmatism. In a larger sense, he says the corporation's role in society depends on one's social philosophy. It may be that its role is to maximize total welfare or happiness, or to maximize profits for shareholders or gains for consumers. The concepts enshrouded in these classifications are not nearly as enigmatic as the terms used to describe them. We've heard them before. Somebody like Milton Friedman he refers to as a dualist, because Friedman espouses max- imization of profits for shareowners as the "social responsibility of business." At the other end of the scale are those who view corporate purpose to be to accommodate "the interests of all groups affected by" it, to make a profit, but also to further the public interest. How, or why, these are different is not defended. The high idealist, for example, would say that "directors should consider the interests of the employees and of the neighborhood" in considering a plant closing, "and they might justifiably decide to continue operating the old plant, even though it continued to lose money or made a subnormal rate of return."5 Those in this category tend to promote interest-group decision making. An argument put forth by some for high idealism is, he notes, "that it would help to disperse governmental power. . . ."6 That one's hard to swallow! It may 2. Public- Private Partnership at 1 1 . 3.

That much has been taught us by the twentieth century. Clark's essay, and the book's concluding chapter by Professor Liebman, are, for the lawyer at least, perhaps the most provocative and well constructed of the volume. Clark classifies ways to view a corporation. Liebman grapples with the role of business in profit, not-for-profit, and traditionally governmental spheres of activity. The central issue with which both these discussions ultimately must deal is the creation and allocation of capital resources. In his chapter, Liebman discusses the techniques used to check managerial discretion and correctly notes that it is incorrect to believe that "today's corporation acts solely on a calculation of discounted future profits, constrained only by legally binding norms."7 Despite the constraints of government, he observes that "western business is a marvelously successful social instrument, operating under conditions of competi- tiveness, appropriateness of the profit measure and effective outside limitations on the imposition of external costs."8 The marvelously successful quality of the modern corporation is perhaps one of the reasons it has run into so much difficulty in recent decades. We expect too much of it. And when it delivers poorly, we blame it, forgetting that of itself the corporation is nothing but a piece of paper styled a charter, and that what it does is nothing more than what is done collectively and individually by those who make up its parts - shareowners, managers, and employees. Of itself, a corporation - big or small - can do nothing. It can injure no one; it can benefit no one. It cannot even establish goals. People do all those things; the corporation is merely a legal form for the accomplishment of people-determined goals. When writing about the modern corporation, the goals thought of are usually economic, and therefore also social, but they need not be. The enormous success of the form is a good reason for studying hard before tinkering with it. Nicholas Wolfson is one of those giving close examination to the modern corporation, and coming up with critical assessments of the nonmarket forces written about in Public- Private Partnership that are at work to constrain it. His The Modern Corporation builds a strong case for faith in the operation of the market to achieve the goals of shareholder protection, management responsive- ness, and satisfaction of consumer demands. While The Modern Corporation has six parts, the book largely divides into thirds, the first dealing with the theory of the corporation, the second with specific issues in the forefront of corporate governance today, and a third portion that is largely a critique of SEC effectiveness. The thesis of the volume is that the "legitimacy and true character of the large publicly held corporation have been . . . gravely misunderstood . . . .",9 and the assumption on which American corporate law is falsely premised is that large publicly held corporations are powerful ministates run by control groups 7.

In his view, large publicly owned corporations are "dynamic competitive economic entities] circumscribed by powerful free-mar- ket forces." The preferences of shareowners and the benefits of the general public are adequately served by free-market forces. Where Wolfson and most of the writers in Public- Private Partnership dis- agree is in their respective faith in the operation of the market. The reformers, both traditionalists and radicals, would move government deeper and deeper into the governance of corporations. Wolfson would move government out. In commenting on the reform movements from Berle and Means and others later, he takes issue with the thesis that the separation of ownership and control was devised to suit the interest of control. Rather, it evolved naturally because it was useful to shareowners. The organizational structure of the large publicly held corporation just happens to fit best the needs for attracting large capital investment and, at the same time, keeping to a minimum the costs associated with its monitoring. The separation of ownership from control that Berle and Means and later reformers found a problem is, Wolfson forcefully argues, the inevitable conse- quence of the need to manage capital efficiently. The alternative is for share- owners to do the managing, "an obvious absurdity." He writes: Shareholders are not owners; they are risk takers .... The shareholders have entrusted power to control in order to maximize their return. Corpo- rate control or management personnel are specialists in monitoring. If they did not exist or if they disappeared they would have to be created in order to satisfy the investment desires of shareholders. Unlike management in government they are forced to monitor efficiently because of the efficient public stock market .... that swiftly disciplines inefficient monitors .... The remarkable fact is that in their efforts to place judicial and govern- mental restraint on the structure, corporate law reformers are frustrating a process that has evolved as a result of natural forces that operate for the benefit of shareholders and the public.12 10.

To this Wolfson adds: Since the corporation is not a ministate, however, but a dynamic competitive economic entity circumscribed by powerful free-market forces, the law has been built upon a false assumption. As is always the case when fiction overwhelms fact in the law, the shape of corporate law has evolved into a twisted and contorted configuration. The general and specific theories underlying corporate legal concepts thus have for generations floated in midair free from any mooring in empirical data or sound economic philosophy. 12. /¿at 40-41.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews of The Modern Corporation and Public- Private Partnership 1539 This deep faith in the effectiveness of market forces shapes the views articulated in The Modern Corporation that are at odds with conventional wisdom and with the views set forth in Public- Private Partnership. Shareholder democracy he terms an illusion, if by it is intended a service to shareholders. Small shareholders do not need it; the power of liquidity is a far superior method for expressing disapproval of manager performance. A related move- ment often associated with shareholder democracy, namely constituency direc- tors, in his view would "serve to exaggerate the separation between shareholders and management by putting into power individuals and groups that do not have business agendas."13 Such directors would further the interests of their particu- lar groups, not those of the shareholders. His critique of the movement for independent directors is equally sharp. "The movement," he says, "is so suspect in light of its obvious deficiencies as to raise the suspicion that the advocates have a hidden agenda to use the reform to forestall more radical changes."14 It is a movement, he believes, premised on the false notion that large publicly owned corporations are unguided or misguided ministates. But if that were true, it would be a stupid public indeed that limits its reforms to the independent director idea. The thought that six or seven business executives can put on the hat called independent director, and over the course of several days per year effectively monitor the actions of senior management of a large corporation in which they have little financial interest is absurd.15 If you read these two books - and your time would be well spent and you well rewarded by doing so - read Public- Private Partnership first. If you read only one of them, read Wolfson's. Public- Private Partnership brings together some provocative comments and views on the corporation - the large publicly owned corporation. They are familiar to the contemplative observer of the corporate scene in recent decades. On the other hand, The Modern Corporation is a well- thought-out critique of many of the movements and articulates views that have not often been aired as the debate has unfolded during the middle decades of the 13. /¿.at 81. 14.

For example, a finance expert in her capacity as independent director can bring needed expertise to board deliberations. A prominent academic in the field of science or economics can assist the corporation in many problems that come before the board. A group of independents not directors can evaluate proposed transactions, particularly those involving the self-interests of managerial directors, and render helpful reports.

This reviewer asked that question once before in a piece contributed to a volume titled Corporations at the Crossroads (McGraw-Hill 1980 at 374). For what it is worth, here was the response: I think so. But the question is not the one of penultimate importance. Viewing ... a corporation as essentially a legal form for getting things accomplished, whether it continues with us is not the critical question, although it is significant. Not even is the inquiry, Will capitalism survive? But here the focus comes closer to the mark. Of transcending importance is whether American society will reserve for citizenry the right to pursue privately discerned individual objectives, to experiment, to succeed and to fail - in short, whether it will preserve a condition for the maximization of choice. If it does this, capitalism has a future and the corporate form will probably be with us for some time to come.</page></plain_text>
