<plain_text><page sequence="1">Half Bitter, Half Sweet: An Excursion into Italian-American History. By ALEXANDER DECONDE. (New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1972. 466 pp. $12.50) After a long ethnic drought, the history of the Italians in America has become more popular. In addition to the relatively new books by Nelli, Iorizzo and Mondello, as well as Tomasi and Engel, there is now this volume by Alexander De Conde, who has turned his attention from diplomatic history to immigration, culturally explained. The book is more than the "excursion into Italian-American history" promised by its subtitle. Like the rest of us, DeConde faced some complex prob- lems, not only of organization but of content. Wading into a sea of details only lately exhumed, he doubtless found it difficult to combine in one book "a wide-ranging survey and analysis stretching over more than two centuries and across half the world." Years of hard work are obvious on every page. An extensive biblio- graphical essay (59 pages of small type) reflects the book's scope. In a sense this annotated discussion of the sources takes the place of foot- notes. Although well written, perhaps the book ranges too widely. Parts of it might have been slimmed. One also gets the impression that the author cannot quite set aside his expertise in diplomatic history-which sometimes does not mesh easily with the ethnic story. Various themes are beginning to emerge about the American Italians. Two traditions of immigrant politics developed. The first was based around the old padrone concept that the leader of a group of immi-</page><page sequence="2">396 PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW grants knew what was good for his people. LaGuardia was both inher- itor and actualizer of that idea. But he also stood on the watershed of a newer concept-appeal to non-ethnic voters. Pastore, Volpe, and Ali- oto are politicians operating in this vein. The vote-getting process, thus, is a phenomenon upon which historians need to expand. Yet it is complicated to trace precisely how the immigrant vote produced spo- radic bloc-like results in view of the reluctance of the Italians to sur- render their independence and to unite behind an ethnic candidate. Another theme that needs to be stressed (DeConde does so at the conscious level) is the great price in loss of culture and denial of lan- guage and folkways that the immigrant unconsciously paid for upward mobility within the "American system." This is not to disregard the material advances that occurred, as the author properly records. Other important motifs concern the church and organized crime. As to the church, a real indignity has been suffered by the American Italians in their subjection to the Irish Catholic hierarchy. This con- cept of being imprisoned within one's own faith needs to be stressed further. In terms of bishops and the "higher leadership" these immi- grants have been virtually disfranchised. The Italian tie with the Vati- can notwithstanding, it is the national clerical hierarchies that nominate the princes of the church. The Italian immigrant's ambivalence toward religion (an almost anthropomorphic one) is partly responsible for the vacuum. We need further attention to this historic pseudo-religious- ness. Perhaps the trickiest subject to track (DeConde does well with it) is the charge that these immigrants tended toward crime. Trustworthy interpreters (including Barzini and Albini) deny that there is an Ameri- can Mafia. DeConde leans toward that interpretation also. There will be much more written about the implication in criminality of second generation "hoods" who oozed upward from America's ghetto streets. This liability and the failure of the American Italians to enter the aca- demic and literary establishments in greater numbers are topics that. ethnic historians will wish to explore further. Meanwhile, DeConde's book provides yet another intelligent narrative interpretation of the Italian American story. ANDREW ROLLE Occidental College</page></plain_text>
