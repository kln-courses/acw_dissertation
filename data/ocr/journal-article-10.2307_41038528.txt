Each issue of Current Directions features a diverse mix of reports on various topics such as language, memory and cognition, development, the neural basis of behavior and emotions, various aspects of psychopathology, and theory of mind. These articles allow readers to stay apprised of important developments across subfields beyond their areas of expertise and bodies of research they might not otherwise be aware of. The articles in Current Directions are also written to be accessible to non-experts, making them ideally suited for use in the classroom as teaching supplements. Most Current Directions reviews are commissioned by the Editor, but readers are encouraged to submit brief (1 - 2 pages) proposals for reviews. Proposals should be e-mailed to the Editor, Randall W. Engle, at cdps@gatech.edu. (Please do not send by US mail.)
