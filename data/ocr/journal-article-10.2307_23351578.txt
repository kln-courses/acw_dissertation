<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES WAS THERE A HIGH GOD 77 IN SHANG RELIGION? ROBERT ENO The invention of religious ideas is an obscure process, as difficult to trace as the imagined entities it creates. In the case of China, we know that substantially abstract concepts of supreme divinity were in place from an early date, but how early and by what evolutionary path these concepts came to be is not yet clear. In this philological essay I hope to shed some new light on these issues by questioning a common assumption concerning Chinese religious history: that there existed during the Shang period a concept of a supreme god Ti I will propose two central hypotheses, defend them as far as I can on the basis of positive evidence, and note such counter-evidence as I find difficult to integrate into these theories. The hypotheses are (1) that Shang religious inscriptions suggest that "ti" (or "shang-ti" _h ^j?)1 may have been em ployed solely as a generic or corporate term, never implying the concept of a single supreme deity, and (2) that this usage may grow from an early use of the word ti to denote a deceased lineage leader, such as a lineage founder or late lineage head, derived from a root meaning of "father." The latter hypothesis suggests that the term could have possessed shifting referents within the context of clan religious dis course, paralleling the usage pattern predicated by the first hypothesis. Traditional Portraits of Ti in Shang Inscriptions It is generally acknowledged that the term ti sometimes functions as a corporate or generic term (as in the phrase wu ti 2x W, "the Five Emperors"); however, the hypothesis that in Shang religion ti served solely as a generic or corporate term stands in contrast to what I take to be a consensus portrait of Ti or Shang Ti in Shang religion. That portrait 1. The term shang ti occurs on only three oracle texts (listed in Shima Kunio H #5 H, lnkyo bokuji sorui fix tit S [Tokyo: Daian, 1967], 149c). In the sole instance where context is sufficient to judge, the term functions indistinguishably from ti. Early China 15 (1990)</page><page sequence="2">WAS THERE A HIGH GOD 77? pictures Ti as a single supreme deity reigning at the apex of the complex Shang pantheon: the high god of the Shang. While there has been considerable debate concerning the nature of this supreme deity, in particular concerning the question of whether Ti was conceived as a high ancestor, I am not aware that any interpreters have questioned the validity of the view that Shang religious ideas included the notion of a supreme deity denoted by the term ti (or shang-ti). Historically, our picture of Ti as a supreme deity predates the discovery of the oracle inscriptions, and rests principally upon the use of the term ti in early Chou texts such as the Shih ching and Shang shu. These sources of the consensus view work against my first hypothesis, but I will put them aside initially and consider their counter-evidence later, in the section on Shang and Chou religious contrasts. I will begin my analysis by sketching an outline portrait of the function of the term ti in the oracle inscriptions.2 As I do so, it will be convenient to employ traditional terminology and refer to "Ti" as a singular deity. In this way, my initial outline will reproduce a version of the consensus viewpoint against which I will later argue. The Shang worshiped many deities, and their pantheon was complex. The majority of the spirit figures that we can identify in the texts are ancestors of the royal Tzu clan. These fall into three general groups: semi-mythical ancestors, predynastic kings, and dynastic kings and their family members. Next in prominence are nature spirits. Among these, the most frequently mentioned are River (the Yellow River), Mountain (Mt. Yueh ?), Wind, and the cardinal directions.3 The pan theon is filled out by a number of figures whose status is in question. Some appear to have been state heroes; others may have joined the royal pantheon from popular myths or local cult traditions. Finding the meaning of ti means, in part, determining Ti's place in this pantheon. To do this, I will first consider whether the role Ti plays in the inscriptions suggests Ti was cast as an ancestral figure or as a 2. My discussion will focus on oracle texts that employ the graph ^ as a noun, and also those that employ the cognate graph ^ as a noun. (Listings for such texts appear in lnkyo bokuji sorui, 157-59.) In general, these two graphs correspond respectively to the modern graphs ti W and ti (in Shang texts, a verb denoting performance of a ritual I will refer to as the "fi-sacrifice"). The graphs are sometimes used interchange ably, and occasionally the interpretation of a text may vary according to whether such loan usage is attributed. 3. Whether these deities were conceived as places and natural forces or as the gods of these places and natural forces is a moot point. In a static model it would make no difference functionally, although it might profoundly affect further religious and philosophical elaborations over time.</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT ENO natural force. Because much of the evidence in this regard has been well sifted and collated in the past, I will deal with it in a summary fashion.4 Ti possessed many powers over nature: Ti could control rain, wind, and other weather conditions, all of which bore on the fall harvest — the central concern of the Shang people — which was thus under Ti's control as well. Ti shared these powers with other nature spirits such as River and Mountain, but the range of Ti's natural powers seems to have exceeded any other single deity's. This suggests that Ti may have been supreme among nature spirits. But these natural powers do not prove that Ti was Nature, or was conceived as a part of Nature. According to oracle records, royal ances tors could also influence weather and crops, and they were certainly conceived in human form.5 Furthermore, while deities such as River, Mountain, and Wind were identifiably parts of Nature, Ti appears not to have been conceived in the same way, the word ti denoting no particular object in the natural world.6 These considerations tend to support an anthropomorphic picture of Ti. There is more evidence to this effect. The subjects of the divination charges can be roughly divided into affairs of nature and affairs of the state and royal family. In general we find that ancestral deities were expected to influence both types of affairs, while the powers of nature deities were almost completely restricted to the realm of natural affairs.7 4. The most complete discussion of which I am aware is Hu Hou-hsiian's !$■ ft two-part article, "Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti" St h fr + W-t WTfUW, in Li-shih yen-chiu M £i W 55 1959.9, 23—50; 1959.10, 89-110. Summary discussions appear in Ch'en Meng-chia Yin-hsu pu-tz'u tsung-shu fffilife h 'M %£ (Beijing: K'o-hsueh ch'u-pan-she, 1956), 671-82, and Shima Kunio, Yin-hsu pu-tz'u yen-chiu US! IS h S WSf2 (translation of Inkyo bokuji kenkyii [1958]; Taipei: Ting-wen, 1975), 186 -95. 5. Instances of ancestors receiving prayers for crops are numerous; both semi mythical ancestors and dynastic kings are included (for a listing see Eno, "Masters of the Dance: the Role of T'ien [Heaven] in the Teachings of the Early Juist Community" [Ph.D. diss.: University of Michigan, 1984], 111). It should be noted that the portrait here is synchronic. The interaction of ancestral and natural deities actually varies over the history of oracle inscriptions, and is a central feature of Tung Tso-pin's 3? fF K theory of two divination schools. 6. A well known theory concerning the root meaning of the word ti identifies the semantic origin of the term as the calyx of a flower. I will discuss this theory later in this article. However, "calyx" would not function in any sense parallel to "Wind" or "River" (if those terms are taken to refer to Nature spirits). The theory has only to do with etymological origins. Note that if Ti does not denote an object in the natural world, it stands in contrast to the Chou deity T'ien in this regard, and this is reflected in Chou texts, as I will discuss below. 7. This assessment is based on a survey of texts referring to River, Mountain, Clouds, and Wind in Inkyo bokuji sorui. Exceptions may occur in the "ho-jo" series</page><page sequence="4">WAS THERE A HIGH GOD 77? Ti quite clearly possessed powers over both natural and human realms,8 and our conclusion must be that whatever Ti "was," it was something nearer to an ancestral figure than to a natural one. There is a general tendency to treat Ti as a sort of monotheistic apex in the pyramidal pantheon of Shang polytheism, a notion suggested by Chou inscriptions and texts which speak of ancestors "to the left and right of Ti." For instance, Hu Hou-hsiian fi imports the Chou pic ture of Ti's court directly into his analysis of Shang religious practice,9 while David Keightley has interpreted the Shang pantheon as a proto bureaucracy, with Ti as the ultimate, impersonal bureaucratic figure.10 Individual interpreters will dissent from particular aspects of this portrait, but if we are permitted to take this bare outline to represent in general a consensus point of view, we can isolate certain lines of dis sonance that call into question its adequacy. One line of dissonance concerns the bureaucratic model of Ti's role in the Shang pantheon. Bureaucratic imagery is compelling in a Chinese setting, and a heavenly bureaucracy would seem to imply a supreme heavenly ruler, but examination of the inscriptional evidence reveals very little that supports the bureaucratic model. While a hierarchy cer tainly seems to be present in some oracle inscriptions, principally those which list ancestors in sequence of seniority, an articulated command structure is not. We miss the issuing of orders, one god to another, as well as the imagery of courts and titles which we might expect to find.11 Possible traces of such imagery are few and problematic. For example, there are two inscriptions which employ the formula: Ti ch'i/pu lingfeng (181d), but I do not think that "river" should be read as a deity in these texts. The asymmetry with regard to the powers of ancestors and nature deities may reflect a historical process whereby Shang kings extended the legitimacy of the royal Tzu clan rule by broadening the powers of their ancestors, tending towards a coincidence between the pantheons of the clan and the state. 8. See Hu, "Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part 1,24-44; Ch'en, Yin-hsii pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 564 -71; Shima, Yiti-hstt pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 191-93. 9. "In asking for rain or for good harvest, prayers had to be offered to the ancestors at the left and right of Ti, asking them to pass the message along to Ti"; Hu, "Yin pu tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part II, 104. 10.

With the exception of one text, Yi-pien 3121 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 46c), in which River orders rain, Ti is the only figure in the pantheon to issue orders (ling tT). This may be an issue of appropriate rhetoric. When concerns are raised about other deities affecting natural events, the rhetoric typically involves the consequences of a sacrifi cial act. Since such acts did not apply to Ti, as we shall see, a different rhetorical for mula was necessary.</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT ENO W ft / -F 'p JH, "Ti will perhaps/not order Wind," and, as Wind some times functions as a Nature spirit in the oracle texts, it may be argued that Ti is here commanding a subordinate god.12 But many parallel texts exist in which Ti "orders" rain and thunder, and in these it is clear that what is ordered is a natural phenomenon and not a nature spirit.13 There is also an ambiguous inscription which may read: yti Ti shih Feng erh ch'iian ^ ^ jft JH H "[Sacrifice] to Ti's envoy Wind two dogs."14 However, the term rendered "envoy" (shih = {£) may denote not a title but a verb related to sacrifice, bringing the text into parallel with Ch'ien-pien 4.17.5: Divined: ti-sacrifice to Wind three sheep, three pigs, three dogs, where Wind is indeed a deity, but ti denotes a verb of sacrifice.15 Similarly, an inscription on T'ung-tsuan II.l: Wang pin Ti shih wangyu 3: ^#5^ £which may be rendered, "The king shall pin-sacrifice to the envoy of Ti; there shall be no fault," could equally well be rendered, "The king shall perform a pm-sacrifice, a fi-sacrifice, and a s/zi/z-sacrifice; there shall be no fault." This would make the text parallel to, The king shall pin-sacrifice, sui-sacrifice, and /wo-sacrifice; there shall be no fault, a usage found on at least five separate fragments.16 12. Yi-pien 2452; Chui-ho 195 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 157b). 13. Among about thirty inscriptions in which Ti orders rain, three include the phrase, Ti ling to yii W ^ # M: "Ti shall order much rain," (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 157a). Unless we posit a spirit corps of "the Many Rains," these allow us to infer that Ti's orders are for weather conditions, and not to weather deities. Five inscriptions con cerning thunder (reading ^ as lei fif with Yii Hsing-wu ^ ® B: [see Li Hsiao-ting # Jg, Chia-ku wen-tzu chi-shih BP it M P (Nankang: Academia Sinica, 1965), 3427—30]), permit the ambiguity (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 157b). No other inscriptions picture Ti issuing orders. 14. Yi-chu 935 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 158b), on which see Shima, Yin-hsu pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 196 -97. 15. Arguments for interpreting shih as a sacrifice term are given in Yin-hsu pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 185. The most convincing example is Ts'ui-pien 91: it ES E 2}-, "Divined: to Shang-chia s/n'/i-sacrifice five sets of sacrificial beasts." (Kuo Mo-jo places shih at the end of the text due to the spacing of the inscription [Yin-ch'i ts'ui-pien k'ao-shih (Beijing: K'o-hsueh ch'u-pan-she, 1965), 18b], Shima's reading is used here [Inkyo bokuji sorui, 422b].) 16. Inkyo bokuji sorui, 341b. The verb "to pin-sacrifice" appears in parallel with other such verbs in many cases, and with shih on Hou-pien 1.6.1: Wang pin shih Fu-chi 3i 5" H. B: "The king pm-sacrificed and shih-sacrificed to Fu-chi." (Shima reads the text</page><page sequence="6">WAS THERE A HIGH GOD 77? Perhaps the best evidence for a bureaucratic hierarchy is a group of inscriptions which refer to "five ministers of Ti," as in Ts'ui-pien 13: The king shall yu-sacrifice and SMI-Sacrifice to the five ministers of Ti; there will not be rain." But this phrase, which appears on only three bone fragments, and in ambiguous contexts on two of these, is a shaky foundation for a bureaucracy.17 It suggests that terminology of clan or court office had entered religious discourse, but does not permit us to claim that political models had begun to organize the structure of the other world. If Ti does not stand at the apex of a bureaucratic hierarchy, we are confronted with a basic issue concerning the conception of Ti according to traditional views: in the midst of a pantheon populated by deities apparently conceived in very concrete terms as individual ancestors, culture heroes, or spirits of specific places or phenomena in nature, Ti appears to be the sole abstraction. This is a qualitative distinction between Ti and all other members of the pantheon. The abstract nature of Ti has been recognized by many interpreters, and it has been argued that it is just such abstractness that indicates the transcendent power of Ti.18 However, if we confine ourselves to the inscriptional evidence, there are other possibilities for explaining the apparent abstractness of Ti, and I will introduce the hypothesis of ti as a corporate or generic term by exploring this issue. Ti as a Corporate or Generic Term In this section, I will discuss four grounds for arguing that the abstract quality of Ti does not reflect a concept of a single transcendent deity, but is rather due to the fact that ti was a flexible term that could be used to denote a body of deities considered collectively (as a corpo rate term), or as a way of referring to a specific member of the pantheon individually but not by name (as a generic term). To paraphrase for clarity, the term ti denoted not "God on High," but "the gods," or "the god," where the identities of these were understood in the context of awkwardly in reverse order as Vu-chi shi wang bin 3 i I? [Inkyo bokuji sorui, 422b]. I am unclear why; it is the sole text on the fragment.) 17. It should be noted that Ch'en Meng-chia casts a broader net to cover up to ten inscriptions which he believes name or allude to the five ministers; Yin-hsu pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 572. 18. For example, Ito Michiharu jM?p, Chugoku kodai ocho no keisei &lt;f S3 COJ&amp;ffi (Tokyo: Sobunsha, 1975), 10.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT ENO divination. According to these arguments, the abstract nature of Ti may be fully explained by viewing ti as a unique kind of religious term, rather than by viewing Ti as a unique kind of deity. The four grounds I will discuss are, (1) the absence of sacrifices to Ti; (2) inconsistent usage of the term ti; (3) the apparent use of ti as a plural term; (4) the use of ti as an honorific. The Absence of Sacrifices to Ti. The most powerful evidence that Ti was conceived abstractly is the apparent fact that Ti did not receive sacrifices. It is not universally accepted that this is so, and some scholars, Shima Kunio ft in particular, have been at pains to isolate inscriptions that indicate sacrifices to Ti. Among those who do argue the absence of direct sacrifices to Ti, the lacuna is usually explained through two arguments: that Ti was so exalted that it was beyond sacrifices, and that sacrifices were made to Ti, but because of Ti's stature they were made indirectly through an intermediary. I will argue that Ti was not an object of sacrifice and that this was so because the term ti, as generic, was an inappropriate term for naming the object of a sacrifice. Shima has provided the most thorough challenge to the premise that Ti received no direct sacrifices.19 Even he was able to adduce only five possible instances of direct sacrifice to Ti, and in only one of these does the evidence seem to support Shima's claim.20 K'u-fang 1738 reads: Cracks made on wu-hsu: perhaps a prayer-ritual for harvest to Ti. Here too, the interpretation is uncertain; the inscription ends at the edge of the bone fragment, and Ch'en Meng-chia has argued that a cyclical sign may have followed ti, denoting a specific ancestor.21 Even if we grant Shima's claim here, it seems injudicious to conclude on the basis of a single anomalous instance that Ti could receive sacrifices 19. Shima, Yin-hsii pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 195-97. 20. The other four include T'ung-tsuan II. 1 and Yi-chu 935, discussed above. In both cases, Shima's interpretation relies on the poorly grounded assumption that a ti sacrifice in which the sacrificial object is unnamed is necessarily a sacrifice to Ti. In a third example, K'u-fang 985, Shima interprets the phrase K T as "perhaps shih sacrifice to Ti"; however, ti could equally well be taken as a verb of sacrifice (in addition, Ch'en Meng-chia has questioned the authenticity of this inscription [Yin-hsii pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 652]). In a fourth example, Hsu-pien 2.18.9, Shima's claim rests on an asserted identity between the graphs a and which evidence does not support; see Eno, The Confucian Creation of Heaven, (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990), 184. 21. Ch'en, Yin-hsii pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 579.</page><page sequence="8">WAS THERE A HIGH GOD Til directly; the complete absence of other instances is far weightier evidence in favor of a norm of no direct sacrifices. Were we to adopt the theory of ti as a generic term, a more likely interpretation would be that the specific name of the sacrificial object was omitted by accident, because the inscriber had lost track, or because the specific referent of ti was understood in the context of the divination. Apart from the examples that Shima cites, another group of possible instances exists. This is an ambiguous set of inscriptions which contains the phrase "fang ti" ^ ^,.22 The translations for "fang' and "ti" here are uncertain. The phrase could mean "/ang-sacrifice to Ti"; "/a«g-sacrifice and fi-sacrifice"; or "f!-sacrifice to [at?] the cardinal directions."23 Al though it seems to me unlikely that this is an instance of Ti receiving sacrifice, these inscriptions are perhaps more likely than any others to be records of such a practice.24 One final piece of evidence remains which might point to Ti receiving direct sacrifice. A Shang period inscription, the Pi-ch'i yu £P K ^ (I) contains the following dating formula: which could be read as follows: [It was] in the first month, just at the day of the jung-sacrifice to Pi ping and the X-sacrifice to Ta-yi, in the king's second sacrificial cycle, after having ftufl-sacrificed to Ti above. I have argued elsewhere that in this inscription, "hua" may be a generic term for sacrifice, and the final phrase may simply refer to the comple tion of the sacrifices to the two ancestors named in the prior phrase.25 However, based on a detailed account by Chang Cheng-lang 5r5$5(#t of the forging of this inscription, I am now convinced that the text itself is simply not genuine.26 22. Inkyo bokuji sorui, 460a-b. 23. Shima takes "fang-ti" as designating the chiao JP -sacrifice to T'ien; Shima, Yin hsti pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 200. Wu Ch'i-ch'ang ^ H takes both ti and fang as sacrifice names; Yin-hsu shu-ch'i chieh-ku (1934; rpt. Taipei: Yi-wen, I960), 54. 24. Not only would the/flng-sacrifice be the sole type of sacrifice offered to Ti, but Ti would also be the sole object of the /flng-sacrifice. The few inscriptional examples are brief and cryptic; it seems unlikely that the only sacrifices made directly to Ti would be divined about in so cursory a manner. 25. Eno, "Masters of the Dance," 65. 26. Chang7s appraisal, written over forty years ago, has been published in Robert W. Bagley, Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections (Washington D.C. and Cambridge, Mass.: The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, 1987), 528. Its findings have been previously adopted by Hu Hou-hsiian</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT ENO Despite the apparent fact that Ti received no sacrifices directly, it is possible to argue that in some cases Ti was the ultimate object of sacri fices offered to other deities. This theory, argued by a number of inter preters, holds that Ti was too revered to be sacrificed to directly, hence it was necessary to select another deity (or ancestor) as "helpmate" {p'ei SB) and sacrifice to that deity.27 The basic evidence for this theory derives not from the Shang inscriptions, but rather from traditional Chou texts.28 But although it is quite true that such a ritual style existed during the late Chou, and texts from that period and later aver that the early kings sacrificed to T'ien and Ti through their ancestors in this way, there is very little evidence to indicate that the "helpmate" format was practiced during the Shang or early Chou. Ikeda Suetoshi tlfc EH ^ ^IJ has argued that this was very likely a late tradition dating from the Eastern Chou period which was projected into the past, in part, to legitimize certain usurpations of royal ritual by the feudal state of Lu #, and fostered by later Lu-school Ju.29 While Ikeda has constructed similar models to ac count for a variety of phenomena, his argument from silence here is im ("Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part II, 91n) and Virginia Kane ("The Chronological Significance of the Inscribed Ancestor Dedication in the Periodization of Shang Dynasty Bronze Vessels/' Artibus Asiae 35 [1973], 362n). 27. Ch'en Meng-chia applies this model in discussing the pin -sacrifice; Yin-hsil pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 573. Shima interprets the fi-sacrifice in this light; Yin-hsu pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 199). 28. The locus classicus for this tradition is the Han text Hsiao-ching #8, 9, but there are earlier references. The Hsiao-ching text reads, "Nothing exalts the father more than [taking him to be the] helpmate of T'ien. ... Of old, the Duke of Chou took Hou-chi to be T'ien's helpmate during the c/imo-sacrifice, and performed the tSHttg-sacrifice to King Wen in the Bright Hall, that he should be helpmate to Ti above." (The relation between T'ien and Ti, which I will address below, need not concern us at this point.) The original image of the "p'ei" is a marital one, hence the translation "helpmate" (a rendering suggested to me by Anne Behnke). P'ei was used as a loan for fei #B, "wife" (see Tuan Yii-ts'ai's IS -K -ft comments in Ting Fu-pao T iShuo-wen chieh-tzu ku lin 'f fi1? # 6667a). The Kung-yang chuan {# (Hsiian 3) discusses the p'ei ssu @3 /IB, helpmate sacrifice, by analogy with marriage: "Why must the king take an ancestor as helpmate [for Ti]? One who goes out from within does not proceed with out a mate (p'i EE); one who comes from without does not stay without a lord (chu ±)." In fact, the p'ei-ssu style of sacrificing to T'ien and Ti may well have been an ela boration of an established Chou tradition of sacrificing to an ancestor and his wife to gether. In the Yi-li -Ufa, "Shao-lao k'uei-shih li" the wife is the p'ei in the formula: "[I] offer annual grain-sacrifice to august ancestor Po-X, taking his wife (fei) X as helpmate (p'ei), nee X"; Yi-li chu-shu ■UlliiijS (Shih-san ching chu-shu ed.), 47.1196. 29.

There is certainly little or no evidence in either the Shang ora cle texts or the Chou bronze inscriptions to support the claim that the "helpmate" style of sacrifice (p'ei-ssu) was practiced at an early date.30 If it is true that Ti received no sacrifices whatever, then Ti is indeed anomalous in the Shang pantheon. Interpreters who claim that Ti was too exalted to receive sacrifices need to go one step further and note that Ti alone of all the spirits needed and desired no sustenance. This is perhaps the starkest division between Ti and other deities, and places Ti quite outside the natural realm within which were confined all other spirits. Inconsistent Usage of the Term 77. If Ti were so abstract a figure that it could receive no sacrifices, we are surprised to find a single, anomalous instance in which Ti appears in precise parallel with various royal ancestors, suggesting that Ti was not only an ancestor, but a particular ancestor. This evidence is an inscrip tional set, consisting of ten parallel texts in which royal ancestors are pictured as "guests" for one another.31 Ti appears among these ancestors 30. Instances of the phrase p'ei-t'ien 12 ^ do occur in sources such as the Shang shu and Shih ching, but as Ikeda notes, these generally carry the idea of "to be worthy of T'ien" in an ethical, not a religious sense; "Hai ten ko," 37—42. Ikeda does cite one instance that he believes referred to a p'ei-t'ien ritual, which records King Wu's orders to the Duke of Chou: S M Spring and autumn never lax ¥ ilE^F In sacrifice be unerring ll H in ® Great august lord (hou) Ti jfiilili/nlS August ancestor Hou-chi. (Shih ching 300/3) This may suggest a sacrificial form such as the p'ei-ssu 12 IE, but the language is very vague, and the only other instance of the phrase hou-ti la Wf of which I am aware clearly refers to an earthly ruler (Tso-chuan, Chao 1; commentary tradition identifies this as Yao). It may be that "Hou-ti" is Hou-chi, his title being varied to avoid rhetorical monotony. Western Chou bronze inscriptions provide no evidence of the p'ei-ssu being applied to either T'ien or Ti, with one possible exception. That is the inscription of the Ta feng kuei A IS (also called the T'ien-wang kuei 5? t St), which includes the following passage: -iK jfE T 3-- 3S £E 1? _h "[The king performed an] yi-sacrifice to the king's brilliant father King Wen, serving and hsi sacrificing to Ti above." Shima takes this to be an example of the p'ei-ssu (Yin-hsii pu tz'u yen-chiu, 184). "Shih hsi shang-ti" # # _L Tj? could equally well take King Wen as the subject, in which case it would read, "who serves and pleases Ti above." If hsi is indeed used in the sense of a sacrifice name, then the inscription would indicate parallel sacrifices, one to King Wen and one to Ti, which would not be a p'ei-ssu style sacrifice at all, as I understand it. We will confront further problems with this passage below, in the section on Shang and Chou religious contrasts. 31. Ping-pien 36 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 275d). The ceremony involved in these</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT ENO 11 in six instances. For example: Divined: Ch'eng shall be guest to Ti. This appears in sequence with: Divined: Ta-chia shall be guest to Ch'eng. Divined: Hsia-yi shall be guest to Ch'eng. Similar inscriptions on other fragments read: Divined: Fu-yi shall be guest to Tsu-yi.32 In all cases, a junior ancestor is "guest" to a senior ancestor, and if the parallel is followed, Ti here would be a Shang ancestor senior to Ch'eng T'ang.33 In these inscriptions, it would make sense to interpret ti as denoting the "most senior" member of the Shang lineage, which could be Shang-chia _h EP, Hsieh §§, or K'u #, depending on how the founding of the Shang lineage was conceived.34 Regardless of which ancestor we might choose, the use of ti to denote a specific ancestor seems basically inconsistent with the character of Ti as fully abstract.35 inscriptions is called the pin 1^1 -ceremony, and may be related to the common sacrifice denoted by the similar graph, pin &lt;^t. However, grammar and usage distinguish the two: the latter ceremony was performed by the king to an ancestral spirit, while the one in question here links two spirits, and divinations concerning it require the use of the particle ytt Keightley, interpreting the two ceremonies as identical, takes these inscriptions as evidence of a hierarchical generational interaction among a heavenly proto-bureaucracy; "The Religious Commitment," 218. 32. Yi-pien 2977 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 276a). 33. Although these inscriptions resemble the p'ei-ssu formula in some respects, they differ in that the more distant object of the ceremony is in most instances unquestion ably an ancestor who elsewhere receives sacrifices directly. It would appear from the consistent positions of junior and senior spirits that this pin-ceremony involved sacrifices to the junior spirit at the shrine of the senior "host," precisely the opposite of the p'ei-ssu model. 34. The proper limits of the royal lineage and the appearance or nonappearance of ancestral names prior to Shang-chia are complex issues, not directly relevant to our discussion. It may be noted that the inscriptions I am discussing suggest that Ho Ping-ti's claim that Ti was K'u has at least some degree of plausibility; Ho, The Cradle of the East (Hong Kong: Chinese U. of Hong Kong Press, 1975), 329. 35.

Ti as a Plural Term In Shang oracle texts, pluralization is noted by the prefixed modifier to , and there are no instances in which this modifier precedes the term ti. However, there is one case in which the term ti acts parallel to plural nouns, and another instance where it appears to be used in a complex plural word, suggesting that ti may have ordinarily been used as a plural term. In the case of divinations made to determine which spirits are "striking the king with illness" (flf 3i &lt;jK), only three subjects are ever mentioned: Ti is one; the others are to-pi %r fttfc, "the many consorts," and hsia-shang (:~F _h), "those below and above," both plural nouns.36 The phrase hsia-shang is of particular interest here. Hsia-shang seem clearly to be spirits collectively named, and they share with Ti and certain ancestors powers to confer approval, assist military ventures, and affect the king7s health.37 If ti functions parallel to to-pi and hsia-shang, then it may be functioning as a corporate term. A further piece of evidence in support of viewing ti as a corporate next hsin day, Ti will descend, perhaps entering the great shrine at X; [divined at] Y"; Hu, "Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part I, 32. (The phrase Z. Ifc, "shrine of Hsiao-yi," appears next to this text, but how it is related is not clear.) I do not claim to understand the text well, but the following problems exist with Hu's interpretation: (1) The use of chiang K as an intransitive verb, "descend," is highly unusual in oracle inscriptions (on the basis of texts employing the term listed in Inkyo bokuji sorui, 178, the divination concerning the descent to earth of a spirit would seem to be unique); it would be more natural to assume the rhetorical ellipsis of an object word denoting a disaster. If such a word were supplied, the subject of the following \etb,ju A, "enter," (or na IS, "submit sacrificially") would most likely be the king or a ritual subordinate. (2) The word ch'i 3$ ordinarily indicates that the described event would be an undesirable one. If the event is indeed the descent to earth of the high god Ti, occurring at an obscure shrine (a side room, according to Ch'en Meng-chia [Yin-hsii pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 472]), in an obscure place apparently distant from the Shang ritual center and mentioned in only this one known inscription — and this event is undesirable — then our ideas of Shang religion may be in need of rather thorough revision. 36. Inkyo bokuji sorui, 327d. "Strike the king with illness" is a tentative rendering, taking °f as chao SI (with Ting Shan T ill; Chia-ku wen-tzu chi-shih, 3757) and as ch'uang V (with Yang Shu-ta ibid., 2521—22). 37. The term hsia-shang occurs with reasonable frequency; relevant passages appear in Inkyo bokuji sorui, 149d-150a. See the discussions of this term in Hu, "Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part II, 93- 96, and in Ikeda Suetoshi, Inkyo shokei kohen shakubunko ^ § M W SC (Hiroshima: Hiroshima Daigaku Bungakubu Chugokutetsugaku kenkyushitsu, 1964), 45. Shima, Hu, and Ch'en all take the term to combine Shang Ti with various other spirits; Yin-hsii pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 195.

This phrase occurs in three inscriptions, of which only one provides adequate context for interpretation: The king made a divination saying: Hereupon. . . approve. Hereupon make a prayer ritual to the king Tis.38 If we interpret ti as a corporate term, the modifier wang would delimit the range of denotation to those Ti who were kings. Ch'en Meng-chia takes the word hsia in the inscription to be the upper portion of hsia shang, and if we follow Ch'en, the corporate nature of wang-ti would be a clear parallel.39 Ti as an Honorific The nature of ti as a generic term is suggested by the use of the word as an honorific.40 This use of ti appears in the oracle texts where the father of the reigning king is referred to as "Ti-chia" ^ rather than "Fu-chia" Ef3, "Father Chia"; "Ti-ting" W T rather than "Fu-ting," and "Wen-wu-ti" XSf rather than "Fu-ting." In all these cases, the term ti stands in place of "fu," and is only employed during the reigns of the deceased king's sons.41 In Chou texts, ti sometimes carries the mean ing of "king," hence it would be possible to argue that the semantic value of the honorific is "newly deceased king" rather than "father."42 However, we will see later that in several Chou bronze inscriptions the term ti appears as an honorific connected with deceased fathers who were not Chou kings, which supports the latter interpretation. The absence of sacrifices to Ti, inconsistencies in the apparent referen 38. Hsti-ts'un 1.1594 (Inkyo bokuji sorui, 158c). Hu Hou-hsuan discusses the phrase wang-ti by tacitly assuming that the term must be singular, denoting the father of the reigning king; Hu, "Yin pu-tz'u chung te shang-ti ho wang-ti," part II, 92-93. 39. Ch'en, Yin-hsu pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 579. 40. There is some evidence that ti served as a generic term in naming nature deities; for example, Hstt-pien 2.4.11 reads: ff its "Lwo-sacrifice to Cloud Ti." This would support the arguments made here, but the evidence is weak. 41. Ch'en Meng-chia believes that in at least one instance ti is used as a posthumous title for an ancestor other than the reigning king's father; Yin-hsu pu-tz'u tsung-shu, 422. Ch'en's argument relies on a debatable reading of a Shang bronze inscription on the Pi-ch'i yu (II). The authenticity of this inscription has been discred ited by Chang Cheng-lang (see note 26 above; the remarks concerning the Pi-ch'i yu (I) there apply to this vessel as well). Ch'en's interpretation has, in any event, been rebut ted by Percival Yetts ("A Datable Shang-Yin Inscription," Asia Major, n.s. 1 [1949—50], 93—94) and Shima (Yin-hsii pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 143,183). 42.

Ti could have at times denoted the entire pantheon, a portion of the pantheon delimited by the context of the divinatory act, the founding ancestor of the Shang lineage, or perhaps the father of the reigning king, with his cyclical sign omitted. Shang and Chou Religious Contrasts The hypothesis that ti functioned solely as a corporate or generic term may conform better to Shang inscriptional evidence than the picture of Ti as a single supreme deity, but it is in tension with the picture of Ti visible in later Chou texts, the sources of the consensus view. In those texts, Ti is clearly a semi-abstract anthropomorphic deity, substantially identical to T'ien, except in certain instances where T'ien seems pictured as the heavenly residence of the gods, where a somewhat less abstract deity Ti presides. King Wen is above Bright in T'ien .. . King Wen ascends and descends At the left and right of Ti.43 To explain this change we need a theory of the religious transition from Shang to Chou, and while I cannot fully develop such a theory in the confines of this paper, I can outline what such a theory would entail. Let me begin with the relationship between T'ien and Ti. It is generally, but not universally, acknowledged that T'ien does not appear in the Shang oracle texts, and that this suggests that T'ien was initially a Chou deity.44 Interpreters who adopt this view usually reason that the Chou simply adopted the Shang high god Ti as the equivalent of T'ien after the conquest, and used the terms interchangeably. This viewpoint often raises the question of whether the two gods were, in some way, initially identical, but since we do not commonly grant the real existence of either deity, for our purposes we may rephrase the question and ask whether the royal religious systems of the Shang and 43.

In fact, we have good reason to believe that the systems were not isomorphic. The pantheon visible through the oracle texts (particularly in Period I texts, where most references to Ti occur) seems far more complex than the pantheon of Chou bronze inscriptions, which refer only to T'ien, Ti, and ancestral figures. Ito Michiharu H &gt;2 tn has suggested that the complexity of the Shang pantheon was the product of long term cultural adaptation, Shang rulers co-opting the loyalties of conquered groups by finding a place in the Shang pantheon for their deities.45 The establishment of the Chou polity through military alli ances followed by rapid conquest of the Shang state need have involved no such religious development. The theory I will suggest here is that the royal Chou religion initially included only ancestral figures and the ruling deity T'ien, which repre sented a supreme deity, the spirit of the sky, where the ancestors lived. After the conquest, as Chou culture absorbed additional Shang ele ments, the Shang term ti gradually came to denote T'ien in the sense of the sky spirit, but not in the sense of the sky or the abode of the ances tors, while the term t'ien continued to be applicable to all three aspects.46 The persuasiveness of this theory would be enhanced if we could provide evidence of an initial silence concerning Ti during the Chou, indicating a hiatus during which time the Shang term was adapted to Chou religious discourse. Such a claim would require us to deal with textual counter-evidence in the Shang shu by viewing the speeches of the Chou founders recorded there, which repeatedly picture Ti as a supreme deity rhetorically identical to T'ien, as retrospective reconstruc tions rather than on-the-spot transcripts.47 Chou bronze inscriptions provide very little resistance to the theory of such a hiatus. The term ti, in the sense of a deity, appears in only two 45. Ito, Chugoku kodai ocho no keisei, 58 -64. 46. For our purposes here, I am avoiding possible complexities in the evolution of the term T'ien. 47. It is difficult to conceive how existing evidence might adjudicate between the notion of these texts as immediate records of speeches and the vaguer possibility of "Western Chou authorship." (For evidence supporting much later dating of these texts, see, Eno, "Masters of the Dance," 122-24.) We might note that in the case of references to Ti in the Shih ching, a number of scholars view the oldest Chou portions of the text to be the "Chou sung," and internal evidence suggests that these cannot be dated before the mid-tenth century B.C.; see, e.g., Ch'ii Wan-li J3 M, Shih ching shih yi (Taipei: Hua-kang, 1974), 261; Shirakawa Shizuka E=l /11 (rp, Shih ching yen chiu W W 55, Tu Cheng-sheng tt IE trans., (Taipei: Yu-shih wen-hua, 1974, 218—19), which would not be inconsistent with our hiatus theory.</page><page sequence="16">16 WAS THERE A HIGH GOD Til early inscriptions: the HsingHou kuei (also called the Chou Kung kuei Mj and the Ta feng kuei M 3S.48 The first of these is usually dated to the years of transition between Kings Ch'eng and K'ang, or about 1000 B.C. On it, we find the following phrase: [I] will serve with dispatch; may the gods above and below never end their mandate for the Chou. Here we encounter ti in the sense of a deity, but the phrase shang-hsia ti is clearly plural, and is not inconsistent with my main hypothesis.49 The sole instance of an earlier inscription employing the term ti in the sense of a deity is the Ta feng kuei, which includes the phrase: [The King] performed the yi-sacrifice to his brilliant father, King Wen, who serves and pleases Shang Ti.50 The Ta feng kuei is usually dated to the reign of King Wu (c. 1045—1043 B.C.), on the basis of this reference to his "father, King Wen." If so dated, the inscription clearly contradicts the claim that the early Chou did not refer to the deity Ti. But there are several strategies by which this evidence could be reconciled with my theory. We could follow the counsel of Shirakawa Shizuka E=| ji| and, on the basis of later passages in the inscription, date the text to the reign of King K'ang (c. 1005— 978 B.C.).51 This would at least give us about a half century hiatus in the use of the term Ti. A second strategy would be to dispute the standard transcription. As Shirakawa notes, the rubbing of the term 48. This assumes a ninth century B.C. date for the companion inscriptions on the Tsung Chou chung m Wi IS and the Fu kuei ti JS (see, Lo Hsi-chang H ff jf., "Shensi Fu-feng fa-hsien Hsi-Chou Li Wang Fu kuei" K H ffi 5$ 23 /S] Hi IE $k Wi, Wen-wu JCty} 1979.4,89 -91), which are sometimes dated to the reign of King Chao (c. 977—957 B.C.). 49. This interpretation relies on my punctuating after pen-tsou ^ir. Ch'en Meng chia reads the passage with a break after shang-hsia. This would distort the sense of pen-tsou, which is used to refer to political rather than religious service, and ignores the fact that shang-hsia ti (^) is inscribed as a single graphemic unit; Ch'en, "Hsi Chou fung-ch'i tuan-tai" IS JU $1 #§ Rff jX, Part 3, K'ao-ku hsiieh-pao, 1956.1, 75.

A final possibility would be to dispute the authenticity of the inscription, which, although much treasured, is unusually unintelligible, includes anomalous reference to a string of unidentified kings, and employs a calligraphic style that Shirakawa has acknowledged to be unique and debased.53 While none of these taken alone distinguishes the Ta feng kuei from other problematic inscriptions, together they may bring into question the adequacy of its text to pro vide authoritative evidence without independent corroboration. Hence, if we view the inscriptional corpus as our best evidence, only a single text, whose date, transcription, and authenticity may all be dis puted, stands as counter-evidence to the model of a century-long hiatus between the Chou conquest and the use of the term ti to denote a supreme deity.54 It is a curious feature of the transitional model I offer here that it adopts certain aspects of Herrlee Creel's theory of the origins of T'ien and applies them to the history of Ti. Creel maintained that prior to de noting a single supreme deity, the term "t'ien" denoted the ancestral Chou kings as a group.55 Creel's theory is attractive, but as there exists no positive evidence to support it, it must still be considered specula tive.56 Yet, bearing Creel's theory in mind, it may be possible to argue that the true emergence in Chinese religious tradition of an abstractly conceived supreme deity postdates the Chou conquest, when the need to universalize the authority behind the shift of ruling mandate led to a merger of the corporate ancestors of Shang and Chou — Ti and T'ien — into a single apex of ethical authority. If, in this way, cultural co optation proceeded in the form of significant religious invention, it would be less meaningful to compare T'ien of the Chou to Ti of the Shang than to explore for contrasts in the pre- and post-conquest forms of each.57 52.

The Etymology of the Word Ti To complete my theory that ti was employed solely as a corporate or generic term during the Shang, I will propose here an etymological model which claims that the term ti originally denoted a father, particularly one who stood in a position of leadership within a lineage, a root usage that would naturally give rise to ambiguities of corporate and generic reference. (My evidence will only support the application of the term to deceased lineage leaders, but does not rule out the possibili ty that living lineage leaders may have been denoted by the term.) As I noted at the outset, it is non-controversial to claim that the word ti is sometimes employed as a corporate or generic term. This usage is most commonly used to denote deceased earthly rulers, and early Chinese word books routinely gloss ti with definitions such as, "The title of he who rules the world" (Shuo-wen chieh-tzu), or "a ruler" (Erh ya). We have already discussed how ti was applied during the Shang as an honorific for fathers of reigning kings. The search for the etymological roots of the word, however, have sometimes assumed the priority of the sense of supreme deity, and the most popular current theory of the origins of the term — as originally denoting the calyx of the flower — employs this strategy. There has been no shortage of proposed interpretations of the graph ti. Todo Akiyasu jH 5S has suggested that the graph shows strings bound together, denoting the sense of "tightly tied," as in the cognate word *d'ieg/fi I?,58 and many other ideas resemble his in being based on the adducing of a graphemic/phonetic cognate to support a visual impression, not tightly tied to evidence of usage in inscriptional texts.59 Ikeda Suetoshi has proposed that the graph depicts an ancestral skull perched atop an altar scaffold,60 and his idea is not far removed from the opinions of Kato Joken #Q j§i ^ H and Shirakawa Shizuka who claim that the graph depicts an altar and scaffold (uncapped by a skull),61 and of Yeh Yii-sen who saw the graph as representing the bundled 58.

The interpretation that has carried the day, however, is none of these, but rather one first suggested by the Sung scholar Cheng Chiao HP H (1102—1160) and given analytic respectability by Wu Ta-ch'eng, Wang Kuo-wei 3i B] $§, and Kuo Mo-jo in this century. These scholars read the graph as depicting the calyx of a flower, adducing as evidence the graphemic/phonemic cognate ti W- Kuo took the argument furthest, maintaining that the worship of Ti reflects an early religious apprecia tion of the fecundity of the plant world, symbolized by the seed-bearing powers of the calyx. He reasoned that the exaltation of the calyx as the symbol of divine power probably dated from the time when society evolved from the stage of hunting and gathering to settled farming.63 The calyx hypothesis is attractive, but there are serious problems with it. One issue is that no trace of plant worship in any form can be detected in the Shang or Chou records we possess. This lacuna can be partially repaired by positing the extreme antiquity of the tradition, and suggesting that the original sense of the word ti had been lost by the time extant written records were generated. However, this begs the question of how the "inventors" of the graph, presumably people not too far removed in time from the written records, could have known the tradition well enough to rely on it in formulating the graph. Moreover, the hypothesis of an archaic practice of plant worship for a culture like the Shang, whose religious imagery is so permeated by animal forms and utterly free of plant motifs, is not without problems. The calyx model assumes that the word ti, prior to the assignment of a written graph, denoted an abstract supreme deity, and that generic uses of the term in the sense of "ruler" or as an honorific for deceased kings were derived. The process by which such a sacred term comes to be diffused in this way is by no means clear. It would seem to make better sense to derive the sacred term from the generic, much as, say, the term "lord" came to be used as "the Lord," or the Germanic term for spirit, "god," came to be used as the exclusive term, "God." If the formulators of the calyx hypothesis (and other such theories) mean to suggest that 62. See Chia-ku wen-tzu chi-shih, 1.27—28. Yeh shared the general opinion that the Zwo-sacrifice was offered to Ti through the "p'ci-ssu" format.

"Ti" was the name of the Shang high deity, the process whereby a word parallel to "Jehovah" came to have political and familial applications is opaque indeed.64 As we turn to consider positive evidence for the claim of a root mean ing of "father" for the word ti, we should recall our earlier discussion of the use of ti in oracle texts as an honorific for the fathers of reigning Shang kings. Chou bronze inscriptions provide evidence of a different form of honorific usage wherein ti is employed as an honorific adjective preceding the noun k'ao or "late father," as in this phrase from the ChungShih-fu ting Jflf: May [this vessel] be used to feast and to serve filially my august grandfather and lordly (ti) father.65 Further positive evidence can be found by exploring the graphemic phonetic word family to which ti (*tieg) belongs for cognate terms that may reflect semantic extensions of such a root meaning. Several of these seem immediately promising. The word *tiek/ti M denotes a principal wife,66 and it is used in combination to denote the male heir of a lineage leader by that wife (ti-tzu -?). The linguistic relationship here could be easily expressed if we adopt the rendering of "lord" for ti, giving us "lady" and "lordling" for the cognates. A recently excavated bronze dating from the Shang-Chou transition period may cast additional light on this cognate word. The Shang tsun ® # inscription reads: It was in the fifth month, on ting-hai. Ti-hou awarded Keng Chi thirty strings of cowries and presented (?) her with twenty le measures of silk, wherefore Shang has made this precious tsun vessel dedicated to his patterned ancestress, whose shrine day is ting.

The bestower of the gift, Ti-hou, would logically be a figure eminent in the Shang lineage. It would make good sense to suggest that, consistent with the fact that the recorded event and the dedication both involve female members of the lineage, Ti-hou was also a female lineage figure, perhaps the widow of the leader of this branch of the Shang lineage, in which case, the title "Ti hou" would correspond perfectly to the term *tiek/fi. This cognate word *tiek/H also carries a meaning of "hereditary" (as of office) or, "to assume hereditary office," and, in the written form H? it appears with this sense on a number of bronze inscriptions, in phrases such as: ssu nai tsu ti kuan jip]75il. WU, "succeed to the hereditary office of your ancestors."69 In addition, the word *d'iek/fz' i®, "enemy," is linked in the Erh-ya to terms for "strong," and "comparable,"70 and is glossed elsewhere as "a peer" or "one of equal rank,"71 perhaps reflecting the competing stature of leaders of different lineage groups. A final member of this word family that contributes to this model is the term *d'ie^fi W, derived from the Shang graph denoting the performance of the fi-sacrifice. As I noted earlier, the graph for this verbal form is a frequent loan for the word ti in oracle texts. The commentary traditions concerning the nature of the fksacrifice are contradictory, a fact to which I shall return. But Chou bronze texts give a very clear picture of the h'-sacrifice as a sacrifice offered to a deceased father. There are three references to the ^'-sacrifice among the inscriptions. In one, the Lieh ting flj M inscription, the sacrifice is performed by the king to his father: The King f/-sacrificed an ox in the Great Temple, fi-sacrificing to fa-chueh chien-pao" US $*, Wen-wu 1978.3, 1—2; Kinbun tsushaku, 50, 369 -72. Shirakawa interprets the phrase I have rendered "Ti-hou" to be "ti-ssu" W W], denoting, in his interpretation, the fi-sacrifice offered to the high god Ti. Apart from the obvious conflict with the ideas of this paper, his reading presumes that the bestowing dignitary is unnamed (a very unusual omission) and that there is an inverted passive verb. 68.

King Chao.72 In the second inscription, on the Hsiao Yti ting /Jn M, the sacrifice is performed to the king's father and to two other former kings, who appear to be the king's grandfather and a founding dynastic king.73 In the third, on the Ta kuei (I), the king directs a non-royal personage to perform the sacrifice to that person's father: The king was in Tien and praised the achievements of Ta, giving him grass-fed livestock, and saying, "With these h'-sacrifice to your late father."74 The nature of the fi-sacrifice as a sacrifice to the father accords with the evidence that ti was an honorific for a deceased father. But commen tary tradition holds very clearly that the fi-sacrifice was offered to more objects than just the father. The Li-chi twice tells us that, "According to ritual, if one is not a king, one does not perform the fi-sacrifice. The king performs the fi-sacrifice to that from whence arose his forbear and takes his forbear as helpmate (p'ei)."75 This is generally interpreted as evi dence of a "-p'ei-ssu" format for the fi-sacrifice, and the sole prerogative of the king to perform this rite supports the idea that the phrase "that from whence arose his forbear" refers to the supreme deity T'ien or Ti, intercourse with which was confined by right to the king.76 The evidence of the Ta kuei (I) refutes the rule of royal prerogative in the fi sacrifice, and as I have argued above, the "p'ei-ssu" model appears to have been a late Chou innovation. However, the tradition that the fi sacrifice took multiple objects may be valid for the early Chou. The Hsiao Yti ting inscription just cited seems to add to the father the grandfather and founding ancestor as objects of the sacrifice. It may be 72. Kuo, Liatig-Chou, I.31a, 111.59.

This tradition holds that the sacrifice was performed upon installation of the father's spirit tablet in the temple shrine, a rite which coincidentally involved the shuffling of the tablets of previous ancestors. By the rules of Chou clan religion, only four generations of ancestors (counting back) were permitted to have inde pendent shrines (the absolute number supposedly varied depending on the rank of the lineage). Upon the death of a lineage leader, the temple of the fifth ascending ancestor was demolished and the tablet of that ancestor was removed from its shrine and taken to a fifth shrine, known as the "t'iao" #fj, which was apparently both the shrine of the lineage founder, and also the repository for all spirit tablets above the fourth ascending ancestor's. A new temple was constructed for the newly deceased.79 Thus the performance of the ^'-sacrifice was an occasion of 77. This idea seems implicit in Chao K'uang's fffi EE T'ang period commentary to Li-chi, "Chi-fa": "The fact that the Yii royal lineage [the Emperor Shun's line] performed the (i-sacrifice to the Yellow Emperor was probably because Shun's grand father, Chuan-hsii, 'came from' the Yellow Emperor, and thus it was a 'fi-sacrifice to that whence came his forbear';" Li-chi chi-chieh, 1093. 78. The best summary I have seen of these issues appears in Ikeda Suetoshi, "Byosei ko" #, Nippon Chiigoku Gakkai hs 11,13-26. See, also, Takezoe Koko's excellent discussion in Tso-chuan hui-chien ~tz. if # H (reprint of Sashi kaisen; Taipei: Kuang-wen), 4.9—12; the comments of Kuei Fu in Shuo-wen chieh-tzu ku-lin (64b); and Shima, Yin-hsti pu-tz'u yen-chiu, 208-11. 79. Commentary tradition is very confused on these issues. My characterization here is merely a choice among competing models, and is consistent with a good percentage of the relevant passages in the Li-chi and other early texts, but relies most heavily on two later Han sources: the Kung-yang chuan, Wen 2 (Ch'en Li W. ±L, Kung yang yi-shu 45- ^ M [Huang-Ch'ing ching-chieh hsii-pien ed.], 38.20a) and the lengthy discussion in the Han-shu Wi iSF biography of Wei Hsiian-ch'eng $ 2T ([Beijing: Chung-hua shu-chii ed.] ch. 73, 3108—19), which recounts memorials composed at the time of the short-lived ritual reforms of 40 B.C. Ikeda Suetoshi considers the entire concept of the t'iao a late Chou perversion, designed to legitimize usurping feudal houses ("Byosei zokko" W\ ®l W. Hiroshima Daigaku Bungakubu kiyo 9.1-34). Ikeda claims that no shrine to the founding ancestor existed in early Chou traditions, and that aristocrats constructed shrines only to the ancestors of four preceding generations, spirit tablets of prior generations being buried and receiving at first fewer, and later no further sacrifices. However, even if the t'iao itself was a late institution, Ikeda's model is not truly inconsistent with mine, as the shuffled tablets</page><page sequence="24">24 WAS THERE A HIGH GOD T/? activity at a number of shrines, and the commentary tradition adds that a further purpose of the ritual was to "inspect the chao and mu," the two sides of the dualistic Chou lineage system that divided the lineage by alternating generations. This may have involved a ritual at the shrine of the father of the newly deceased clan head (i.e. the grandfather's shrine). Such a tradition may reflect a basic structure of the fi-sacrifice during the Chou in which it was performed conjointly at the shrines of the father and first ancestor, or father, grandfather (chao and mu) and first ancestor. This would shed light on the the Hsiao Yti ting text, where the sacrifice appears to be performed to the three ancestors together.80 It should be made clear that the model of the fz-sacrifice outlined here cannot be applied to the Shang oracle texts, where the objects of the ti sacrifice are so diverse as to include nature deities as well as ancestors.81 However, this discrepancy does not affect my claim concerning the etymological origins of the word family governed by ti. The fact that the may have eventually made their way to a common burial site, or "chao-yil" jl&amp; as grave mounds were known. In the late Chou, these "mounds" constituted full-fledged temple complexes, as evidence from the P'ing-shan excavations of the fourth century B.C. site of Chung-shan attests (see Wen-wu 1979.1, 23 -24, where an inscribed bronze map of a chao-yu, referred to in the inscription as a "t'ao," is reproduced). The tradition of moving tablets from ancestral temples to a common grave complex would be adequate for my model. 80. A further possible piece of evidence here concerns two early bronze inscriptions (datable to the late Shang on the basis of calligraphy) known as the Ti-chi Tsu-ting Vu kuei ting Wi tH ifl T and yu ^J. These inscriptions name three ancestors called, in ascending order, "fu" "tsu" J=L, and "X" ▼ (San-tai, 3.17a; 13.22b). This last appellation is considered by some to be a form of ti ^ (see Lo Chen-yii's comments in K'o-chai chi ku-lu % Hf 51 "S" 18.17a, Kuo Mo-jo's in Chia-ku wen-tzu chi-shih, 1.25—26, and Wu Ta-ch'eng's in Chin-wen ku-lin, 1.48—49). The three ancestors named may be the father, grandfather, and lineage founder, conforming to the structure of lineage worship I am suggesting here. However, the uniqueness of the inscriptions and the speculative identification of the graph ▼ as ti make this evidence inconclusive. 81. A number of commentators, noting the inconsistencies in the traditions associated with the f/'-sacrifice, have suggested that the Chou texts conflate several different rituals under one name (see Tuan Yii-ts'ai's comments in Shuo-wen chieh-tzu ku-lin, 64). The Li-chi several times lists the ti-sacrifice as one of the four great seasonal sacrifices ("Wang chih," 314-15; "Chi-t'ung," 1144), and it seems possible that the texts are confusing a Shang equinox or solstice ritual, whose performance was a royal prerogative, with a clan ritual, which may or may not have predated the Chou. A similar conflation of traditions seems to apply to the chiao -sacrifice; see Takezoe Koko's discussion in Tso-chuan hui-chien, 14.38). Some texts picture the chiao and ti as complementary seasonal sacrifices, the former paired with the she it-sacrifice as a ritual performed at outdoor altars and directed to T'ien (or Ti) and the spirits of Nature, the latter paired with the ch'ang W-sacrifice as a ritual performed in the ancestral temple and directed to the ancestral lineage (Li-chi, "Chung-ni yen-chii," 1160; "Chung-yung," section 19).</page><page sequence="25">ROBERT ENO 25 Chou employed the Shang term "^-sacrifice" to denote sacrifices to a collection of deceased lineage leaders, including the late father of the current leader of the lineage, remains valid evidence for a semantic value of "father" governing the word family. In sum, the uses of the term ti as an honorific connected with deceased fathers in Shang oracle texts and Chou bronze inscriptions and the association of a sizable group of cognate terms with meanings related to lineage figures provide substantial evidence for the hypothe sis that the term ti derived its corporate or generic dimensions from an early function of denoting, singly or collectively, the "fathers" of a lineage. If we allow that the sense of lineage "father" was extended in Shang religion to include the realm of nature spirits, in accord with a process of religious co-optation whereby the Shang royal house essen tially "adopted" the gods of nature and conquered ethnic groups into its family lineage, we can account for the function of ti in Shang texts entirely without recourse to the concept of an abstract supreme deity. In so far as the origins of the graph for ti are concerned, these hypotheses would lead us in the direction of the theories proposed by Ikeda Suetoshi, Shirakawa Shizuka, and Kato Joken, mentioned above, which relate the graph to a likeness of the ancestral altar. Additional evidence reinforces the connection between the graph and the ancestral shrine. The use of ti as an honorific in royal ancestral names places it parallel to a set of other generic honorifics used for Shang kings, all of which terms seem to have been designated by graphs that picture parts of the ancestral altar. These honorifics are used to name the predynastic Shang kings, and include the graph fang □ representing the stone case in which the ancestral spirit tablet was lodged,82 and the graph shih T (tk), depicting the spirit altar or tablet.83 In the case of the lineage founder, Shang-chia, the oracle text graph of his name, 0, seems to depict his cyclical designation within the tablet case.84 There is a passage in the Li-chi which states: which may be read as saying that upon the death of a king, After announcement of the death with the words, The King has 82. Three successive predynastic kings are named with this honorific, which appears in the Shih-chi as pao Mi (the logic for the evolution to this character has not, to my mind, been satisfactorily illustrated). 83. The Shih-chi listing gives this honorific as chu ±, also denoting the spirit tablet. It is applied to two successive predynastic kings. 84.

To link the Li-chi passage to the graph, it would be necessary to match the configuration of the graph to a portion of the temple display, and this is not easy to do. It may be possible to speculate that the graph ^ bears resemblance to a robed human figure mounted on a staff, similar to some portable temple icons of later Chinese tradition, and may have represented an early form of such figures. However, no textual or archaeological evidence exists to prove the presence of such icons at so early a date — the materials for such figures would likely have been perishable wood and cloth — and unless such evidence emerges, the most prudent interpre tation is probably that of Kato and Shirakawa, which sees the graph as a picture of the ancestral altar of sacrifice. Conclusion If we allow ourselves to view early inscriptional evidence free of presumptions derived from later textual sources, the existence in the Shang of the concept of a supreme deity no longer seems assured. It is consistent with the evidence to argue that what has appeared to us to be the "high god Ti" was, in fact, a corporate body of royal "fathers," denoted individually or collectively by the word ti according to divinatory contexts. It would only be with the advent of the Chou that the concept of a supreme deity emerges. Whether this evolutionary stage belongs to the pre- or post-conquest period is a question beyond the scope of this paper. The findings reached here are far from conclusive. The traditional portrait of the Shang high god Ti retains powerful attractions, and we cannot yet deny to pre-Chou culture the credit for inventing the ab straction of such a supreme deity. But the evidence we have encoun tered does bring the old story into question, and may lead us to explore with new attention the complex evolution of religious concepts in early China. 85.
