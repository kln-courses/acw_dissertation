<plain_text><page sequence="1">159 Akkadian Sidelights on a fragmentary Epic (') E. Douglas Van Buren - Rome In the glyptic art of the Akkadian period, an epoch fertile in conceptions and new methods of artistic expression, the representations on cylinder seals sometimes seem reminiscent of more than one mythological tradition. Yet they are not composed of stock figures taken haphazard to fill a space from some other formal complex. Much more does it seem as if the seal-cutters were aware that all mythological tradition was a pageant of the doings of the gods. It was immaterial whether the events were portrayed in the precise order in which they occurred ; more important was the connecting thread running through the whole narrative. Therefore a representation was not rigidly limited to one theme, but often included allusions to other happenings, thus producing a continuous narrative, an uninter- rupted sequence of ideas in which one episode followed another and foreshadowed those to come. In scenes representing contests of the gods the protagonists are generally featured as nude, or with a girdle, or at most with an exiguous loincloth. That was the pictorial conception formulated in the Second Early Dynastic period when anthropomorphic figures were usually depicted in heroic nudity (*). Apparently the tradition was maintained to emphasize the fact that the events occurred in a remote (!) Abbreviations used in addition to those in general use are : B.

Douglas Van Buren past, in the beginning of all things when raiment was almost unknown. Representations of the contests of gods as a series are believed to illustrate the myth recounted in the Epic enûma elii Tab. VI which relates how the rebel Qingu and his followers fought against the other gods. The subject was complicated and lent itself to digressions pictured as subsidiary conflicts resulting from the main strife. The significance of some of these representations, however, is uncertain or difficult to interpret if they are considered singly, but they appear to form a group apart, and when they are treated as such a definite pattern begins to be traceable from which a consecutive story seems to develop. The figures portrayed in it are mostly clothed. Probably the reason for that was because the portion of the epic which was the theme of the group, had not as yet been ideoplastically formulated. The desire to depict a series of successive events induced the Akkadian artists to borrow certain forms from mythological cycles the iconography of which was already formalized, and mould them into a new pictorial image to illustrate the continuation of the narrative. Although they differ considerably the examples of this group have one feature in common: they all depict a great bird of prey, or a superhuman being with ornithological characteristics (*), and seem to illustrate passages from the legend of Zû which have not been fully preserved. The now fragmentary story has to be gathered from more than one source. It seems to begin with the account of how the serpent and the eagle formed a partnership and swore an oath before Shamash (2). After a while the eagle devised evil in his heart and, despite the remonstrances of his wise child, devoured the young of the serpent who made plaint thereof to Shamash. The serpent was able to overcome the eagle by means of a cunning strategy imparted to him by Shamash who gave instructions that when the bird came down the serpent should grasp his wing, pull out his pinions, and cast him into a pit; all of which the serpent accomplished. In spite of appeals for mercy to Shamash, who sternly reproved him for his treachery, the eagle lay for eight months in the pit; but he took (i) Cyl. Seals , p. 133.

Meanwhile Etana besought Shamash, as a reward for his piety, to give or show him the herb of birth or re- birth. Shamash bade him start on his way and fare over the mountains where he would see a pit in which lay an eagle who would show him the plant. Unfortunately it is not possible to prove that this was the same herb as the one called " Grey-beards will become young again which Gilgamesh, following the counsels of Utnapshitim, found at the bottom of the sea and plucked. On the return journey, however, Gilgamesh laid the herb down when he bathed in a warm spring, and it was taken by a serpent (A). It seems not unlikely that it was afterwards stolen from the serpent by the eagle. Etana did as Shamash commanded, and the eagle made offers of friendship to him and proposed to bear Etana up to heaven's gate, telling him that it was Ishtar who now had the magic herb. The offer was accepted and they started to fly, but the treacherous bird let Etana fall when their goal was almost attained. In spite of minor discrepancies a scene represented with only slight variations on numerous cylinder seals is usually interpreted as the flight of Etana and the eagle (*). Many phases of rural life are depicted ; a shepherd drives three or four sheep out of a fold, other men are busy making butter or setting out round cheeses in rows to dry. Two big dogs have left their watch over the sheep and sit opposite one another, gazing upwards to follow with their eyes their master's vanishing form as he soars aloft on the back of an eagle. In some examples one man also looks up, and raises a hand in astonishment. In another example two lions rage at the foot of a tree between the branches of which an eagle with spread wings can be seen; it seems to hold a small animal in its talons. The suggestion has been made that this group refers to the earlier part of the story, and that here the place of the serpent is taken by the lions whose cub the eagle has seized (3). It might, however, be an (*) Epic of Gilgamesh , Tab. XI : 282-308. (2) CCO, T. 97, pl. 5, fig. 3 = Découvertes en Chaldée, pl. 30 bis, fig. 13 ; B. M. 89767 ; Southesk Coll.

Douglas Van Buren allusion to the time when the eagle and the serpent shared whatever prey they could find. Moreover, on the same seal the eagle bearing Etana is lion-headed, as it is on B. M. 89767. This varying aspect of the eagle would be singularly appropriate to a being who could change his form at will. If the identification of the myth is accepted it might be possible to see in the female figure kneeling between the dogs on VA. 3456 the wife of Etana speeding her husband on his fatal flight. Objection has been made to the man's position on the eagle's back because the eagle directed Etana to place himself breast to breast with him (*); the difference in position may have been due, however, to technical considerations. Apart from the fact that later references to Etana imply that he was a deified king whereas the hero of the story illustrated in glyptic art was a farmer, there is another serious divergence from the epic which has not, I think, ever been noticed. According to the seals the flight started in the midst of the busy life of a farm ; the epic, on the contrary, describes how Etana had to take a toilsome journey to the inaccessible mountain to find the eagle. The only way to reconcile the discordant accounts would be to postulate an earlier version in which Etana, having released the eagle from the pit, returned with him to his own home to prepare the final details for their enterprise. Certain scenes of rural life, which are generally considered to be without mythological significance, contain elements which link them to the Etana series, such as the sheep driven out of the fold, the orderly rows of cheeses, the man making butter and, above all, the eagle perched on the fold or hovering over the scene. Sometimes these activities are presided over by a dignified seated man who in the first example resembles a divinity because he holds a little drinking bowl in one hand, and in the last example is definitely deified (2). Perhaps these scenes depict the arrangements made by Etana for the running of the farm during his absence. We next hear that Zû beheld the insignia of the Enlil-ship, the tiara of lordship, and the tablets of destiny, and coveted them in (') Jolies, OLZ XIV, cols. 387-90. (2) B.

My throne will I establish ". Therefore he waited at the entrance to the chamber at break of day when Enlil, laying aside his tiara, washed in pure water. Profiting by the opportunity Zû seized the tablets of destiny and flew thence into the inaccessible mountains. The gods assembled in consternation, and Anu addressed them, asking who would slay Zû and thereby make his own name great among men. First lie called upon his son Adad to go, offering rewards and promises of renown. A dad, however, replied: " Who is like Zû among the gods thy children "? He added that Zû had taken the tablets of destiny, the possession of which conferred the Enlil-ship, and consequently no one could now gainsay his word, and whosoever went against him would be mud ! A second divinity was designated, but gave the same excuse, and so did Sharah also. Finally Lugalbanda went to the mountain and apparently overcame the foe by guile, for we are told that be seated the wife and son of Zû at a banquet, and the narrative breaks off : " In strong drink is jollity, is rejoicing ". Later versions named as the victor Lugalmarda (2) or Ninurta (3). Even Marduk was so acclaimed owing to some confusion as to his rôle in the drama (4). A prayer of Assurbânipal addressed to Marduk and Sarpanîtum invokes the god as " thou who brakest the skull of Zû " (5). In the remaining scattered allusions to Zû, which are mostly by way of comparisons, the animosity of the references is testimony to the magnitude of the dread he had once inspired. The mention of his name is usually accompanied by the qualifying adjective "evil". Zû, " the evil Storm-bird ", was a fallen divinity who became a powerful demon able to change his shape at will, for there are hints (A) Epic of Zût Tab. 1 : 1-97, Tab.

Douglas Van Buren that he could assume successively the guise of a man, a lion, and a bird ('). Enkidu, relating his dream, says: " I saw a man with lowering countenance, like to the Zû-bird was his countenance; his nails were eagle's talons " (2). Zû had a following of demonic beings resembling himself in aspect. A dreamer describes his vision of Nergal reigning as king in the nether world. Among the awesome beings surrounding him Zû and his followers seem to have figured (3). The first was Zû himself as he is portrayed on the seal from Ur which will be discussed later : " The ' evil (god) ' head, both hands (were those of a man), with a horned cap was he crowned, his two feet (were those of)... bird, with his left foot he trod down... the serpent The head of one of his followers was that of the Zû-god ; another resembled a bird, but had human hands and feet. The one in the shape of a bull was apostrophized in a later text: " Oh Bull! off-spring of Zû art thou!" (4). " The evil utukku , his head (was that of) a lion, his two hands, his two feet (were those) of the Zû-god ". Lastly there was " a man whose body was black as pitch, like to the Zû-god was his countenance In later ages these followers of Zû survived in popular belief as demons who brought disease and death (8). Therefore the steeds harnessed to the Elamite wagon 'shich bore away the corpse of Enmesharra were " the death-demons of Zû " ; in the wagon stood the victorious Ninurta, and the driver(?) who stood beside him " held in his hands " (as whip?) " the tongue of Zû which he had pulled out " (6). A seal of green jasper illustrates the ancient theme of conflicts of the gods. On the left is a group of two divine combatants in antithetical attitudes. This stylized struggle is followed by a more animated scene. A nude bowman aims an arrow at a foe who sur- renders, for he is menaced on the further side by an adversary armed with mace and axe. Between the bowman and his objective is an (A) Deimel, Pantheon, pp. 132-3, No. 1327 ; Clay, Babyl. Records IV, pp. 36, 42; Albright, JAOS XL (1920), pp. 313-15. (2) Epic of Gilgamesh , Tab.

The second seal also shows a pair of fighting figures who, although completely nude, have horned caps (Fig. 2) (2). To right are two more figures, one nude but with a horned head-dress just like the first pair, the other long-haired and with a cloth draped round him from waist to knee. Standing one on each side of a mountain, they are engaged in a struggle with an elementary bird-like being who seeks to emerge from the rocky mass. The god on the left tries to batter down the creature with his mace, his companion grasps the monster's leg. Apparently their efforts to annihilate the monster were unavailing, for the next phase shows a little god standing with folded hands to contemplate the spectacle which two attendants throw open the great wings of a gate to reveal : the Sun-god in the act of rising, rays issuing from his body, and holding his toothed blade in one hand. Instead of the usual mountains, however, the deity is portrayed poised on the back of a bird-monster (Fig. 3) (3). The consequences are perhaps shown in another scene in which the Sun-god again appears between the widely opened wings of the gate, here surmounted by the foreparts of lions (Fig. 4) (4). The figure of the god above the mountains is in frontal aspect, and the rays emanating from his body end in stars. His arms hang down limply, and his weapon drops from his nerveless hand. On the left a group of three figures consists of two bearded guardians of the gate who have left their appointed posts and stand looking in opposite directions, while between them is a feathered monster with a great leonine head and the legs and talons of a bird of prey; he is their captive according to the generally accepted opinion. The monster's appearance recalls the description of the demon whose " head was that of a lion, the two hands, the two feet (were those) of the Zû god " (5). Looking more carefully, however, it is possible to perceive that the guardians stand in antithetical attitudes, each with (4) B. M. 122127, BMQ V (1930-31), pp. 97-8, pl. XLVIII, b, No. 4.

It is the monster who extends an arm in front across the body of each warden and hooks his claws into their garments at the waist, thus immobilizing them and preventing them from fulfilling their office. A reproduction of the group, although of poor workmanship, is important because it proves two points (Fig. 5) (4) : firstly, that the monster stretched his arms in front of the bodies of the two guardians; secondly, that he was not only feathered but also winged, for the upper line of the wings extends from his shoulder-blades to right and left and, passing behind the bodies of his captives, re-appears beyond the shoulder of the one on the right; thus the curved lines above and below the monster's right arm on A. 144 are explained. On that seal the guardians look to right and left for succour, but no help is nigh, and the Sun-god, unaided, sinks into the darkness of night. Nevertheless, this was no ordinary sun-set when the sun disappears from sight in a burst of splendour to embark on his journey across the expanse of the sky and re-appears next day in renewed majesty. This en- feebled figure of the deity implies an appalling calamity brought about by the magic wiles of the monster who knew that if the sun vanished from the sky vegetation would perish from the earth. Therefore the representation of a dire portent, the eclipse of the sun, is here set forth (2). The powers of chaos had prevailed, and men were plunged in inspissated gloom. (*) B.

(2) There are no historical documents which mention eclipses before the eighth century B. C., although it is known that solar eclipses were visible in Babylonia in the years 2352, 2224, 2156 B. C., as Professor O. Neugebauer kindly informs me. To him and to Professor Dr. E. F. Weidner I am deeply indebted for information most generously given. I am very grateful to Mr. C. J. Gadd who has called my attention to certain omens which, in their apodoses, refer to Sargon passing through darkness and seeing the light again (Nougayrol, École des Hautes Études, Section des sciences religieuses , Annuaire 1944-45, pp. 15-16, Nos. 55, 62, 66; Schileico, AfO V, (1928-29), pp. 215-16), perhaps a vague allusion to a solar eclipse. The lack of more definitive evidence does not preclude the possibility that such an event occurred and made so profound an impression that it was represented allegorically in glyptic art.</page><page sequence="9">Akkadian Sidelights 011 a fragmentary Epic 167 A seal discovered, appropriately enough, in Grave PG/514 in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is aptly described (â): " The bird-man of darkness and storm " (now wearing the horned cap of divinity) 4 ' oppresses humanity. He tramples on a prostrate man, and presses down the heads of two others kneeling and crying for mercy " (Fig. 6) (8). To right of this group a nude god grasps behind him the apparently lifeless, outstretched body of his defeated opponent. The victor seems to have claws instead of hands, and it is not from his body but from that of the vanquished that the rays ascend, thus indicating that the latter had been one of the followers of the Sun-god. The leader of the divine forces however, has rallied, and stands firmly confronting the powers of evil. The group of three men subjugated by the bird- monster is repeated almost exactly in another scene in which the lion-headed follower of Z û also appears (*). Here the effect of a nebulous realm of twilight is enhanced by the shallow engraving and rubbed condition of the seal's surface. Yet the atmosphere of gloom and foreboding is pierced by a ray of hope to cheer the two timid worshippers who are almost lost amidst these awesome surroundings, for two gods come to the rescue, mounted on their dragons. These deliverers are seen again on a seal which appears to have been rejected by the engraver as an unsuccessful attempt, and therefore never properly finished. They advance to right towards a winged and seemingly feathered monster, now deprived of his horned cap (4). The introduction of a new element does not detract from the atmosphere of the haunted wood in the scene on another seal and in what is apparently a garbled copy of it. In the midst of ravening winged monsters which converge from every direction, a bull advances with lowered head to attack a god who sinks to one knee the better tó seize the beast's horn and plunge a dagger into its shoulder (4) CBS. 16876, Legrain, Ur Excav.

(2) Special thanks are due to Dr. Léon Legrain for all the trouble he took to have a photograph of the cast taken to show the correct order of the figures.

This group of a god immolating a bull seems to have been excerpted from a theme representing a rain-making ceremony in which a bull typifying drought was slain and a rain-goddess then dispensed revivifying showers (2). On the seal in the Hermitage the rain-goddess, standing timidly amongst the pr jwling monsters, looks towards what must be the figure of the Sun-god in the rear. In an alternative version of the slaying of the bull, the god, kneeling on one knee as before, shoots the bull with an arrow, in spite of Zu s lion-headed follower who hastens to his comrade's rescue (4). The bull figuring in these scenes has been explained as the 44 Bull of Heaven " sent by Anu at the request of Ishtar to devastate the land of Uruk and parch vegetation with his fiery breath (3). Yet in all these examples the divine protagonist of the ritual immolation of the bull cannot be identified with Gilgamesh who killed the " Bull of Heaven " after a violent struggle (5). Therefore the seals must il- lustrate a kindred legend in which a bull symbolized a destructive force of nature. Among the misdeeds of Z û was his attempt to cause vegetation to perish. Thus it is probable that the bull here pictured was the bull follower of Zu who, in spite of being re-inforced by the snarling monsters his fellows, was slain by the avenging god so that the little nude figure of the rain-goddess might materialize. Several seals represent succeeding phases of the story. On a rock crystal seal violent action is depicted (Fig. 8) (6). A god sinks to one knee to escape the onset of two lion-headed eagles, a little one, and a bigger one whose wing is grasped by another god who stands upright and holds a mace in his other hand.

The god Ea, holding a vase from which flow streams of water with darting fish, stands with one foot on a mountain and looks to right towards a lesser god who accosts him. The explanation of the scene given by Professor Frankfort is as follows (4): the upright god is Ninurta, identified by his emblem, the lion-headed eagle Imdugud, which attacks a foe in the shape of an anthropomorphic god to whom the smaller bird is added to identify him and indicate his nature. The only occasions in the Akkadian period when Ea is not represented seated, but standing in that particular pose, are when the subject of the representation is in some way connected with the liberation from his mountain grave of Ea's son Marduk. Although this explanation is an exceedingly attractive one as far as the interpretation of Ea's figure is concerned, the rest of the scene may be susceptible of a simpler interpretation, namely, that one of the warring gods is assaulted by the bird-monster in a new form and accompanied by a smaller companion, for we are told that in appearance Zû's demonic followers resembled him. Nevertheless, the upright god, who may well be Ninurta, comes to the rescue of his discomfited comrade, for he grasps the bird's wing and thus carries out the advice given by Shamash to th + serpent. There is no trace of the mountain grave, unless we concur with Professor Frankfort in explaining as such the elevation upon wh ch Ea sets his foot, for owing to limitations of space in glyptic art it was often considered sufficient to allude by the introduction of one typical figure to a whole complicated story; that may have been the case in this instance, for other evidence brought forward by Professor Frankfort offers much more definite confirmation of his very interesting theory. All the necessary elements composing the myth of the liberation of the god from his mountain grave are gathered together in the seal of Adda (Fig. 9) (2). According to Professor Frankfort the rising god is Marduk, or, more accurately, the fertility divinity with characteristics of a sun-god who was later known as Marduk (8). Professor Moortgat, on the contrary, believes that he was an ancient Sumerian divinity Tammuz, whose chthonic cult comprised all the (*) CyL Seals, pp. 105, 133-4 ; see also Iraq I (1934), pp. 14-15.

Douglas Van Buren earliest beliefs in the after-life and in man's hope of attaining im- mortality (4). According to that theory the cult was bitterly opposed for political reasons by the Akkadians who, to enhance the prestige of their Sun-god Shamash, at first tried to suppress the earlier cult and, failing in that attempt, absorbed into the Shamash cult all the Tammuz traditions (2). The arguments of both these learned scholars are very persuasive ; but it is not easy to harmonize them, and both leave problems unsolved or create new difficulties. Marduk's qualifications as a solar deity were of a secondary nature ; he may have been a sun-god, but he was not the Sun-god who at all periods was Shamash. In the Akkadian period there is no authenticated portrait of either Marduk or Tammuz. If the ascending solar god of the seal of Adda rep- resents one or other of those divinities, then every time a divinity is depicted in that particular guise, whether he is rising over the mountains, voyaging in his ship, or engaged in any of the activities usually attributed to Shamash, he must be identified as either Marduk or Tammuz. If the god in question was one of the most important divinities of the Sumerian pantheon it seems strange that there should be no representation in the Early Dynastic period of the dramatic story of his release from the mountain grave. Akkadian artists did not adapt a theme derived from their predecessors, because such an earlier theme did not exist; they themselves had to conceive and formulate the picture. The earliest existing version of the story seems, like the seals, to belong to the Akkadian period (8) ; it implies that the god carried off and imprisoned in the mountain was Shamash, and owing to his confinement vegetation perished on earth for lack of sunshine. If we follow the guidance of the story a literal explanation can be given of every detail represented on the seal of Adda. The rescuer Ninurta has accomplished his task, and the evil Storm-bird hovers powerless over the chasm from which the imprisoned Sun-god begins to rise, (4) Moortgat, Tammuz .

The desiccated tree growing on the mountain typifies the vegetation deprived of sunshine. Close by, the goddess awaits the released god, holding in her hand the mystic herb which will renew his life and vigour, for apparently the eagle spoke the truth when he told Etana that the plant was then in Ishtar's possession. Attended by Usmû, Ea, the Great Magician, sets foot on the opposite mountain peak, ready to instruct the goddess how to apply the magic herb. The scene of contest between the gods and the bird-monster is repeated with slight variations. The half-fallen god is attacked by a single large bird of prey, this time not lion-headed ; he is rescued by his leader whose gestures are the same as before, for he grasps the bird's wing and brandishes a mace to the admiration of a third god who stands in the background (£). But now the brief moment of triumph is over. The bird is grasped by the tail and beaten down by two symmetrically placed opponents, one of whom is armed with a mace (Fig. 10) (s), as is the case on other seals where a god brandishes a mace and grasps the bird's wing which his companion also holds (3). As. 33. 521 links the episode of the defeat of the bird with the wider subject of contests of divinities by depicting in the rear a nude god assaulting a bull-man. Still another seal from Tell Asmar shows the Sun-god as a spectator of the victory over the bird (Fig. 11) (4). He is also included in a scene where two gods, wearing feather-crowns and long, fleecy coats, violently attack a divinity and beat him to his knees (5). One god grabs the victim by the beard and brandishes a weapon, the other wrenches off his horned cap. Below the outstretched arm of the god on the right the great bird falls headlong, powerless to (4) CBS. 13870, PBS XIV, p. 145, pls. XII, LI, No. 177 ; Cyl. Seals , p. 133, pl.

Douglas Van Buren assist his vanquished follower. This seal has been wrongly rolled out, for the impression should have shown the contest on the left, followed by the group of the worshipper before the Sun-god ; in that order the arrangement gains in harmony, and the composition as a whole indicates more clearly the significance of the scene. According to Professor Frankfort the combatant on the left is Ninurta, who in his fertility aspect is accompanied elsewhere by the identical animal (4), and his victim is an anthropomorphic god to whom a bird is added to indicate his nature (2). Moreover, he thinks that the second group is not a conventional picture of a sun-rise, but represents the 4 dying god' Marduk, liberated from his mountain grave and mounting upwards after his resuscitation when the enemy, symbolized by the bird, had been overcome, thus rendering the sprouting foliage in the vase in the rear more appropriate than it would be if it were Shamash who was po.trayed (3). It cannot be denied, however, that the last-named divinity, as on the seal of Adda, has all the conventional characteristics of the Sun-god Shamash. The elevation upon which his feet are placed resembles a ziggurat which would be equally appropriate to Shamash. The vase with foliage did not belong to a fertility god exclusively, for it was a ritual vessel in constant use and was placed in front oí various divinities, particularly Shamash as the Stele of Ur-Nammu and stone and clay reliefs from Susa and elsewhere show. It is interesting to observe that the rays do not really spring from the shoulders of the god, but from his body, just as they do from the figure shown in A. 144 and other carefully delineated examples (4), and as they do from the limp body of the defeated follower of the Sun-god on the seal from Ur. A more archaic representation of what seems to be the final phase of the struggle between the gods and the bird-monster came to light during the excavations at Kish (Fig. 12) (5). A god sets one foot upon a mountain peak and aims an arrow from his bow at a gigantic bird of prey. The other gods are aligned behind him (l) Ball, Light from the East, fig. p. 15 ; B. N. No. 79.

His herald, stationed with his standard in the rear of the fight, is ready to proclaim the successful issue of the conflict. An echo of this ancient tradition is preserved in an Assyrian text which relates that the divine herald announced to the god Ashur: " Zû is captured", and was at once told: "Hasten, unto all the gods announce the tidings " (£). The form of the herald's proclamation confirms the surmise that the bird-monster was not slain during the conflict (8) ; he survived to be brought in judgment before Ea, as glyptic art abundantly proves (3). The Legend of Zû has come down to us in a mutilated condition which suggests that there was more than one version of the Epic, with a corresponding shifting of the protagonists. None of the fragments preserved narrate the incidents represented in glyptic art, although the seal-cutters must have been inspired by some widely- known version of the Epic. This in itself seem to demonstrate that separate chants or cantos of the story were recited as early as the Akkadian period, even if they were not yet written down and incor- porated into the whole of what later formed the Legend of Zû. In that legend it is remarkable what a prominent part is played by Shamash. The oath of the serpent and the eagle was sworn before Shamash. It was he who gave instructions to the serpent. The god depicted in glyptic art as rising from the recesses of the mountain was given the perfectly conventionalized semblance of Sha- mash, the Sun-god. A link between the story of Zû and that of the imprisoned god may be found in A. 144, if it does really represent an eclipse of the sun brought about by the machinations of the evil Zû-bird in an endeavour to cause vegetation to perish from the earth, for once the guardians of the gate had been rendered helpless the eclipse of the sun inevitably occurred. Moreover, it seems as if the fate of the Sun-god at the hands of the Storm-bird and his confinement in the mountain grave were motivated by Zû's desire to retaliate for what he had himself suffered when cast into the pit by order of Shamash. The combined evidence seems to prove that Shamash was the original 4 dying god ', but that later other deities were Í1) Langdon, Epic of Creation , p. 45, 11. 57-60; KAR No. 143:58-9 (duplicate No. 2*19); AOTAT, p. 321.

Zû, the evil Storm-bird, was astute, however. When his vast plans went astray he could, like the wily Ulysses, extricate himself from every predicament. In spite of all, he was not slain, and our last vision of him is as the still awe-inspiring leader of the demonic hosts who surround the throne of Nergal in the nether world.</page><page sequence="17">Fi g. 1.
