<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRED JEROME A Retreat - and an Advance - for Science and TV Though seemingly a perfect match, science and commercial television have remained strangers. But a recent event may bode a long and deepening relationship . In the early 1950s, the entire stu- dent body of low-income kids at Junior High School 60 in lower Manhattan gathered once a month in the musty auditorium to watch a movie. In December we could count on Miracle on 34th Street, and before Easter it was always Jimmy Stewart and his invisible gi- ant rabbit, Harvey. We saw "geog- raphy" movies - travelogues on Tahiti and other exotic places we could only dream about. And then there was the occa- sional film about science. One movie that has lingered in my memory was an animated cartoon about how blood cells fight dis- ease. Actually, it was a promotional film produced by a major drug company to tout its latest research on vaccines. We watched dead germ cells, the vaccine, being injected into the blood stream. Reacting to this invasion, the white cells reproduced and mobilized, and after swallowing up the dead germs with the effi- ciency of today's Pac-men, the white-cell army stood at the ready, a permanent defense against the real Fred Jerome is executive vice president of the New York-based Scientists' Institute for Public Information. disease. Thus, immunization. Anthropomorphic, to be sure. But for many of us that film made science - for the first time - lively, understandable, even fun. It taught us something about cells and bacte- ria, and simultaneously whetted our appetites to learn more about the human body, biology, and sci- ence in general. Yet the power of movies to bring science to life for mass audi- ences - demonstrated by our fascination with those squiggly white-cell soldiers slurping up germs - has gone almost unnoticed in quarters that should have been paying attention. Using the visual media - which now translates largely into television - to inform and excite people of all ages about science has remained largely overlooked by both the scientific community and the TV industry. That's sad, especially given the extensive discus- sion and documentation of this country's critical need to improve public understanding of science. We face increasingly urgent science- and technology-related policy questions that, in a democracy, require in- formed discussion by citizens as well as government leaders. What to do about acid rain, ozone depletion, SUMMER 1988 87</page><page sequence="2">arms control verification, the AIDS epidemic? And United States competitiveness in the world market- place may be endangered because our educational sys- tem is failing; we are losing out to the Japanese, among others, because our children are not taught enough science. Yet America's number one classroom - the tens of millions of seats in front of television screens - has been virtually ignored by the educators, policy- makers, and funders who set the nation's priorities. It's also sad because if ever a marriage were made in heaven, it should have been between science and television. What, after all, could provide more thrilling scenes than science, with its exciting and uniquely human adventure of exploring the unknown and discovering new worlds - from the eerie edges of the universe to the invisible impulses of subatomic parti- cles? Science is truly "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings at a single bound." Science not only makes the world go 'round, it helps us understand why the world goes 'round. Sure, science is complex. But that's where televi- sion should shine, with its ability to present graphic, colorful moving pictures, to speed things up (a bud unfolding into a flower), to slow things down (the motion of a ball through the air), to animate, to replay. TV can human-ize and humor-ize. Indeed, public television does admirable work with such presentations as "Nova," "Cosmos," and its beauty-and-the-beasts nature shows, but for the most part they are preaching to the choir. And it is a rela- tively small choir at that: PBS estimates that its weekly audience ranges from 1 .2 million to 2.3 million house- holds - only 4 to 5 percent of all viewers. Like it or not, commercial TV is the one truly mass medium in this country. Once, maybe, most scientists didn't care whether or not the public paid attention to science. ("Just leave us alone to work our good work," went a common refrain. "It would take too much time and effort to explain it to you, anyway.") But attitudes have been changing - and perhaps none too soon. Recent years have witnessed increasing attacks, for example, on re- search that involved animal testing and genetic engi- neering. Stanford University President Donald Kennedy sees this as an antiscience trend, which, espe- cially in these economic hard times, threatens to un- dermine the scientific enterprise. With more public understanding may come more enthusiasm. And once, maybe, most commercial TV execu- tives were content to sit on their sitcom assets. But things are not so comfortable in the boardrooms these days, as network television's audience percentage has declined under assault from independent stations and cable TV. For example, the number of people watch- ing the three major network news programs has dropped from 76 percent to 63 percent of the total viewing audience since 1980, according to the indus- try's Nielsen surveys. People are still watching televi- sion, but they are dialing different channels. In this atmosphere, some industry observers sug- gest that network programming is becoming increas- ingly irrelevant to the mainstream of American life. Adding more science to the mix won't cure everything that ails commercial television, but it may provide at least part of what people are looking for. In a recent nationwide audience survey by the Magid Consulting Company to find out what TV viewers want to see on the news, science rated "above average," ahead of such topics as crime, politics, and weather. When net- work decisionmakers become convinced that science can attract viewers - and hence advertisers - more sci- ence will find its way onto the screen. Starting a beautiful friendship But how to bring these natural, if reluctant, partners together? On the weekend of December 11-13 of last year, an event took place in Tarrytown, New York, that broke the ice. For the first time, nearly two dozen leading scientists and almost as many senior commer- cial television executives gathered together to discuss the possibilities for more and better science on televi- sion. This "Retreat on Science and Television" was sponsored by the Scientists' Institute for Public In- formation (SIPI) and funded primarily by the MacAr- thur Foundation, with additional funding from the Sloan Foundation. While not quite an engagement party, the retreat was intended as the first date in a long and deepening relationship. SIPI President Alan McGowan set the tone with his opening remarks. "If Ronald Reagan, battler against the evil empire, and Mikhail Gorbachev can sit down in the same room and develop an ongoing relationship (the summit conference in Washington, D.C., had just concluded two days earlier), then it may even be possible for leaders of the television and scien- 88 ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE AND TV Overcoming the barriers will take a serious commitment of time and money, but the stakes in terms of our nation's future are high. tifie communities to talk," MeGowan declared. "As that noted scientist Humphrey Bogart once said, 'This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.' " Besides friendship, the retreat focused on several specific goals. The television people, most of whom had little or no science back- ground, were to develop a basic awareness of major developments in science. The scientists, whose knowledge of television was largely limited to watching the tube, would better understand the indus- try s behind-the-screen constraints. The participants were also to identify major problems that have tradi- tionally plagued the relationship between science and TV and critically suggest some possible measures to improve things. First came the science. In a session called "The Futures File," Marvin Goldberger (director of the In- stitute for Advanced Study), Leon Lederman (director of the Fermi Laboratory), and Nobelists Roald Hoff- mann (Cornell University chemist) and David Balti- more (director of the Whitehead Institute) outlined major stories that television ought to be tracking. These included the emerging grand unification theory, gene mapping, advanced computers, superconduc- tors, the superconducting super collider, and AIDS research. (Among other developments, Baltimore de- scribed the discovery of the single gene that deter- mines human gender, a story that made newspaper headlines just a few days later but got only scanty TV coverage.) Would these kinds of science stories play in Peo- ria - or on network TV news programs? Tom Bettag, the feisty executive producer of the CBS Evening News, explained some fundamentals of commercial TV. "That's all very interesting, but can you say it in 90 seconds," he challenged. "Because that's what you've got on the network news." And that's not the only problem. "You've got to make it relevant to the immediate lives of your viewers," Bettag continued. "Will it increase their checkbook balance or improve their health? And the story has to have good visuals - people don't turn on their TV sets for what they could get on the radio." But, suggested Lederman, ap- ply these criteria to two possible "stories" for the evening news: Mi- chael Faraday has discovered a new phenomenon relating to electricity, and Napoleon's army is on the move again. "Napoleon would clearly make the evening news," Lederman said. "Faraday would not, even though his discovery would eventually change people's lives far more drastically. Science is the seminal force for change. Shouldn't television's editors and producers exercise some social responsibility with the awareness that what's happen- ing in science today will change people's lives tomor- row?" Bettag acknowledged the dilemma. "Television places government and politics high on the scale of importance, maybe higher than they deserve," he said. "If the newsman's role is to look slightly over the horizon and say, 'Here, this is coming, so be on the lookout for it,' we genuinely have our priorities out of whack. But how do we turn around our present news agenda of crisis, fire, flood, and government?" Bettag's solution? "You have to start by just brushing up against science. You begin with the economic or tech- nological component, and then peel back the layers one by one and work your way down to the pure science." As a case in point, he showed a 3-minute video- tape that his program had recently aired on the pro- posed $5 billion superconducting super collider, noting that "this is the closest we've been to hard science in the past 6 months." The clip included a brief animated display of colliding subatomic parti- cles, but spent most of its time on the politics of select- ing the huge device's location, with long pans of the competing sites. Bettag then invited criticism - "Here's a moving target, with lots of flaws in it, for you to start shouting at" - and the clip quickly became a lightning rod for a lively discussion of what's right and wrong with television coverage of science. For example, Walter Massey, vice president for research at the University of Chicago and president- elect of the American Association for the Advance- ment of Science, pointed out that "there was SUMMER 1988 89</page><page sequence="4">practically no science other than the graphic showing the collision of the particles." David Baltimore was a bit more diplomatic: "I think you've done a good job in seizing people's attention, but not such a good job in taking that attention and teaching them some- thing." And National Science Foundation Director Erich Bloch called the clip outstanding. "Why? Pre- cisely because it played on the Evening News," he said. "You can't teach Physics 101 on the news The problem that needs to be solved is to move sci- ence into the mainstream of people's thinking. And if that's the only thing these stories do for us, they've fulfilled their purpose." Richard O'Regan, executive TV producer for the Christian Science Monitor Reports, underscored tele- vision's concern about lack of visual materials, espe- cially for the hard sciences. "It is very difficult to explain them without pictures," he noted. "The sec- tion in the supercollider clip that told us what this thing is going to do couldn't play more than 10 sec- onds because the visuals weren't there." But there may be hope in the form of new computer-generated graphics. "With the help of scientists, there could be graphics for topics such as chemistry and physics," O'Regan said. Added Bettag, "Fifteen years ago, eco- nomics was considered an appropriate subject only for the print media. The advent of electronic graphics has changed all that for television coverage." Packaging science Throughout the retreat, the roundtable discussions kept coming back to the questions raised by Bettag's CBS News tape. Just how do commercial TV's con- straints and the viewer's level of understanding affect the way science is covered? Do scientists have to be- come used-car salesmen, pitching (one TV producer said "pimping") science as a miracle cure for physical, economic, or social illnesses in order to get air time? How much preaching, how much teaching, and how much simply reaching the viewers with just a taste of science to whet the appetite? If an informal consensus emerged, it was perhaps that there is no single way to transmit science through the tube, but rather that there are many roads to the mass audience. Lucy Shapiro, head of the molecular biology department at Columbia's College of Physi- cians and Surgeons, called on scientists to develop what she called a comprehensive outreach strategy. "Network news is only one type of program," she noted, "and it's got just 20 minutes for the whole world." Needed, she said, is material geared to local stations - for news as well as documentaries - because they have more time to fill. The television people agreed, and offered some specific suggestions. "The process of getting a story on TV is remarkably similar whether it is in Bangor, Maine, or New York City," said Tom Rosenbaum of station WXYZ in Detroit. "Get it to the 'gatekeep- ers' - the assignment editors. They work with the pro- ducers to decide what will be covered and then aired. They assign the reporters and the camera crews. And don't call them up. Get to know them." But be prepared when contacting the media, cau- tioned Ernie Schultz, president of the Radio-Televi- sion News Directors Association. Many other groups, often represented by public relations experts, will also be competing for air time. "They understand the sys- tem and know how it works," he said. "They know the gatekeepers personally and respect them as profes- sionals. They understand why the choices are made and how they are made. They make their story rele- vant by answering the question, 'So what?' Finally, they help get the story easily, sometimes too easily. But if an assignment editor has to choose between two stories of equal news value, and one will be easy to do while the other will be difficult, he or she is obviously going to go with the easy one." The participants also examined how science might be worked into prime-time programming, for as ABC's Alan Weitzel pointed out, "Most people learn most of what they know about science from entertain- ment." Edward Bleier, president of Warner Commu- nications' Pay TV, Animation, and Network Features, led the discussion, announcing, "I bring you greetings from the land of the Philistines." Then, seriously, "There has to be room in entertainment television for more than the mad scientist, more than the sci-fi that nourishes legends but perhaps not knowledge of sci- ence." That got the creative juices flowing. One idea: "Why not have one of the kids on 'Family Ties' an- nounce that he or she has decided to become a scien- tist, leading to a family battle as Michael J. Fox argues that scientists will never make any money?" Another suggestion envisioned a series of biographical dramas on scientists, fictional but representative of real people and events. 90 ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE AND TV The power of television to bring science to life for mass audiences has gone almost unnoticed in quarters that should have been paying attention. The importance of "humaniz- ing" science for television perme- ated the retreat. And in that sense, just as important as the formal ses- sions were the dozens of informal exchanges at breaks, meals, and cocktail receptions. Over coffee, for example, three Nobelists hud- dled over ways to get more visual material to television. Over lunch, ABC's Paul Dolan queried Warren Washington of the National Center for Atmospheric Research about new technologies in weather map- ping and how to blend satellite pic- tures with ground reports. Not only was information exchanged in such interactions, but they helped demystify both science and television, scientist and broadcaster. "Corny as it sounds," Westinghouse Broadcasting's Terry O'Reilly said, "the most important thing to me was coming away with the sense that scientists are people, too." For the scientists, Roald Hoffmann summed up the retreat's spirit in a letter to SIPI: "I learned much about the time pressures under which television and radio reporters and producers operate. The logistics of their work, the identity of their 'gatekeepers' was illu- minating. From the scientists' side, I think we may have reminded them that there are good stories, even drama and comedy, in science and the life of scien- tists. And I hope we awakened a little of their sense of responsibility to report good science, to inform and educate at the same time. It can be done." Thus, the retreat was anything but an exercise in defensive finger-pointing. Perhaps to the surprise of most people there, it turned out that both sides truly wanted to reach out to each other. "We need you to tell us what's really important," said O'Reilly. And the scientists offered to meet, to advise, to discuss - "ev- ery scientist in this room is ready to help," noted Baltimore. The power of suggestions What next? Can science and technology really break into the standard crisis-and-politics fare of local and national news programs or the tide of sitcom silliness that washes over the American mind every evening? If so, how? Participants from both camps were optimis- tic. During and after the retreat, ideas and suggestions poured forth like oil gushing from a well that had been waiting to be tapped. Without settling details (like when, where, and with what), they called on the Scientists' Institute for Pub- lic Information to pursue a variety of short-term and long-term steps. Different folks naturally empha- sized different strokes, but together the ideas constitute a meaty menu of activities. For example, SIPI was en- couraged to organize regular brief- ings for television people by leading scientists, and to campaign to convince networks and local stations to hire science reporters. There should be a program of visits by scien- tists to TV stations "to learn about their operations and constraints," according to one suggestion, and luncheons and dinners to bring broadcasters and sci- entists together on neutral turf. In fact, in January, SIPI launched a series of just such "TV dinners" in Washington, D.C., on issues in "Science, Technology, and National Security." Additional retreats were called for. Some of the retreats would involve TV personnel who work in the thick of the news-gathering operations - assignment editors, news directors, and reporters - and also in- clude university public-information officers with TV experience. (Plans are in the works for such a session early next year.) There should also be a retreat specifi- cally for producers of entertainment television. One SIPI initiative already under way received virtually unanimous support: a Videotape Referral Service that advises TV journalists where and how to get tapes for specific stories. The service, which is part of the institute's established Media Resource Service (MRS), was announced in April at a New England regional meeting of the Radio-Television News Direc- tors Association. The following week, the number of calls to the MRS from TV journalists more than dou- bled. (Normally only 10 to 15 percent of the inquiries are from television.) For example, a journalist from a Kansas City station asked for help in locating graphics that depict depletion of the ozone layer. He was re- ferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Admin- SUMMER 1988 91</page><page sequence="6">istration, which has computer-generated footage based on data gathered last year in Antarctica, and the MRS even helped arrange for the footage to be sent by satel- lite from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in time for the evening news broadcast. The participants also called for SIPI to orches- trate a teleconference on a major breaking science story, where leading scientists "meet" via satellite in a question-and-answer session with local TV journalists around the country. Ernie Schultz, president of the news directors association, has offered to help facili- tate a pilot teleconference on "an issue like AIDS." To help sift through all these ideas and imple- ment as many as possible, the scientists at the retreat have formed an advisory committee to guide SIPI's efforts to reach the television community. Other lead- ing scientists, including Stanford's Kennedy and Chancellor Julius Krevins of the University of Califor- nia, San Francisco, have also enlisted. "The bottom line," according to Jack Gibbons, director of the con- gressional Office of Technology Assessment, "is that the two cultures will immensely profit by a broadening and continuation of this dialogue that began at Tarrytown." There is some evidence that change may be al- ready in the air - indeed, some changes can be seen on the air. Two local television stations, KSL in Salt Lake City and WCVB in Boston, have during the past year added weekly science segments to their evening news broadcasts, and they report good audience re- sponse. Several other stations around the country have experimented with special science series. And as local news programming expands, such openings may continue. However, a few swallows do not make a spring. Just ask John Miller, one of the few veteran science reporters on TV. At least he was. Miller, who has a Ph.D. in social psychology and has covered science for 10 years, was fired in March from WSVN in Miami. The newly appointed news director, according to Miller, didn't think the station needed "specialists." More than history, more than economics, the very word "science" still seems to turn off many of the people responsible for what TV viewers get to watch. Too boring, too complex, too "educational" for our audience - these arguments are the chain-link fence between science and commercial television. (No doubt, this has something to do with the formula-ized memory lessons that pass for science courses in most U.S. schools.) Needed: time and money If the December retreat was an important step toward breaking down the fence between the two communi- ties, it was only a first step - one event attended by a small, albeit prestigious, group. Making a real im- provement in the public's understanding of science and technology will take a concerted effort across a broad front. For example, major science institutions - univer- sities, national laboratories, private research centers, science museums - should assign one person in the public information office to the "television" beat. That person would meet with local news directors, producers, and reporters, invite them for visits and to luncheons and cocktail receptions with scientists, and generally encourage cordial and continuing relations between scientists and television people. The institu- tions should also establish videotape production facili- ties (or cooperate with existing film departments) to produce quality footage suitable for commercial TV audiences. And on an individual basis, leading scien- tists should use their considerable influence within the corporate community to encourage major companies to sponsor science programs on television. Government agencies and private foundations that give research grants should begin to include sup- plemental funding in every grant to pay for dissemi- nating the results to the mass media, with specific allocations for reaching television. The money could be contingent upon a review of the research results, but it needs to be earmarked with the initial grant to ensure that attention be paid from the outset to a media outreach effort. Such funds could dramatically change the ivory-tower approach of many researchers and yet would constitute a microscopic fraction of the millions of dollars that agencies such as the National Institutes of Health spend on research. The science community, through the National Academies, the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science, and leading professional soci- eties, as well as smaller organizations, should set up a national task force to develop - and market - televi- sion science programs for children. These could in- clude such items as dramas based on the lives of real scientists (how about a series based on De Kruifs 92 ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE AND TV exciting masterpiece, The Microbe Hunters? ), car- toons, and 30-second spots "advertising" the adven- ture, mystery, and challenge of science as a field for young explorers. It will take a serious commitment of time and money, but the stakes in terms of our nation's future are high. The goal is simple: to make science and technology relevant to mainstream America - inter- esting, even humorous, and, above all, human. Recommended reading James A. Baggett, "Is Superman a Fraud?"
