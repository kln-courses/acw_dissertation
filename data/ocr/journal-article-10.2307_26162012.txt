<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THE ECO SUBPOLITICAL Revisiting Bill McKibben and The End of Nature TIMOTHY W. LUKE Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University This essay reappraises the importance of Bill McKibben's The End of Nature in the develop ing canon of important environmental political and social theory. The End of Nature was published at an opportune moment in the development of advanced industrial society that saw the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the opening of many nations to globalization, and a rapid increase in middle-class populations around the world. This essay provides a critical appre ciation of McKibben's project while at the same time highlighting the power of intrinsic technological and institutional forces in the subpolitical organization of production and consumption that make it very difficult to make environmental improvements through individual moral resolutions and actions. Fifteen years after its initial publication in book form, Bill McKibben's moving and meaningful The End of Nature ( 1989) clearly can be said to be a citation classic and foundational work in the area of environmental studies. Few books have had as broad or as lasting an audience as The End of Nature, which has been translated into more than 20 languages as well as republished in a special 10th anniversary edition with a new introduction (McKibben, 1999). Bringing out into open debate the major questions about global warming, oceanic change, atmo spheric chemistry, bioengineering, industrial pollution, and population pressure that other authorities had been considering in small conversations between special ists for years or decades, The End of Nature pulled all these issue strings together in a way that forced many readers worldwide to enter a far larger conversation about these challenges—one that continues today. Arguing that humanity's anthropo centrism had finally become materially undeniable on a global scale as enduring anthropomorphic changes in terrestrial processes, the book plainly cast a powerful critical light on one of this era's most foundational changes. During the intervening years, McKibben revisited various themes and issues in The End of Nature (1989) in subsequent works, including The Age of Missing Information (1992), Hope, Human and Wild (1995), and Maybe One( 1998). Still, it is this work that remains singularly significant, and well worth counting among the foundational works of environmental studies. Regrettably, few of the problems that McKibben (1989) identified have been adequately addressed, and most of them only have worsened during the intervening decade and a half since this book's publication. In 1989, he could plead for a return to an "organic nature," So 1 hope against hope. Though not in our time, and not in the time of our children, or their children, if we now, today, limited our numbers and our desires and our Organization &amp; Environment, Vol. 18 No. 2, June 2005 202-206 DOI: 10.1177/1086026605276014 © 2005 Sage Publications 202</page><page sequence="2">Luke / COLLECTIVE ACTION 203 ambitions, perhaps nature could some day resume its independent working. (McKibben, 1989, p. 215) Such decisions to limit our numbers and desires, of course, have not been made, and they seem unlikely to happen (as he himself feared in 1989). Why this has not been done, even though it is what must be done, is an intriguing question. And, this problem might, in part, be traceable to the sense of human agency, political will, and technological choice that McKibben (1989) mobilizes in this very important analysis. In many ways, he tends to frame these choices as if they were definitely discrete decision points—like declaring war, resolving to go to the moon, or passing tax reform—under the full provenance of the democratic state. Although they could be, they are not, and McKibben appears to either ignore or neglect the nuances here in the ways such choices actually get made. McKibben's wonder in 1989 about how "human society seems, at least on these most important of issues, to be paralyzed" (1999, p. xvi) is understandable, but his insistence about leaving the responsibility for, and the possibility to, act effectively to change things in the abstract register of we, human beings, or us still does not ring entirely true. The cultural critique that human beings, in some sense, "are dif ferent from the rest of the natural order, for the single reason that we possess the possibility of self-restraint, of choosing some other way" (McKibben, 1999, p. xxi) remains generally defensible. Yet, in fact, not all human beings have an equal abil ity, inclination, opportunity, or willingness to make this change, and this vital dif ference brings us to the domain of power politics where he still apparently believes "we" could "make the collective decision on whether or not to restrain ourselves" (McKibben, 1999, p. xxi). Some will agree with him: Politics can solve our problems by turning toward "the green state," "ecological populism," or "discursive ecological democracy" (Dryzek &amp; Schlosberg, 2004; Eckersley, 2004; Luke, 1999). They might be cor rect, but his faith in politics alone rings false; so many different administrative, ethi cal, legislative, and regulatory interventions over the past generation have been tried, and these have mostly failed completely or only slowed the rate of destruc tion. This is true because liberal democratic politics typically restricts itself to the domains of government, public administration, regulation, or civic management, which overlook too many sites and structures where the real damage continues to be done. As McKibben (1999) noted, such transformative change would be diffi cult, because it "involves tinkering with virtually every facet of our daily lives. We would need to change the ways we move ourselves around, the spaces we live in, the jobs we perform, the food we eat" (pp. xxi-xxii). Consequently, the problem is more one of organized collective action on a grand scale rather than simply ordinary politics and the power of business interests. These foundational changes could be made, and some diverse, localized initia tives, as he recounts in Hope, Human and Wild (1995), are promising. But the lim ited changes discussed in that text are all too often done only on the margins by the poor, of the poor, and for the poor. Plainly, their lives are improved, but the truly crushing ill effects on the Earth caused by human economies and societies are com ing from elsewhere, created by the rich. And, one still finds a lack of will, interest, and understanding about what pulls the richest, richer, and near rich political regimes away from tinkering with every facet of their daily lives. For them, as McKibben ( 1999) suggested, it is plain that "the Earth has become abstract, and the economy concrete" (p. xxiii), yet such cultural insights and ethical indignation do not change much very quickly unless widely shared.</page><page sequence="3">204 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2005 It is not shared, and what prevents tinkering with everything in ordinary life has everything to do with modern humans as "machines for burning fossil fuels" (McKibben, 1999, p. xxi). How can they evolve into something different? Where are the obstacles? Arguably, these questions cannot be answered politically, because they are subpolitical in their solidity, structure, and substance. McKibben's unwitting study of what essentially is subpoliticization via media immersion in The Age of Missing Information (1992) finds one of its key messages in the flow of images, energies, and materials back and forth along global commod ity chains: "You are the center of the world, the most important item in all creation" (McKibben, 1999, p. xxiv). Unlike the larger public projects of command, control, and communication underpinning what is usually identified as the state, smaller, albeit deeper and more numerous, corporate and professional agendas for private profit and power sustain broader networks of governmentality in the economy and society, which Beck (1992) sees as the "subpolitical." What is more, financial, professional, and techni cal agendas embedded in the subpolis cripple many possibilities for collective action and confuse the imagination as they get caught somewhere between a tradi tional vision of politics and nonpolitics (Luke, 1997). As Beck suspects, big tech nological systems, like cybernetic networks, telecommunications grids, or computer applications, are becoming the material basis for: a third entity, acquiring the precarious hybrid status of a sub-politics, in which the scope of social changes precipitated varies inversely with their legitimation.... Thus business and techno-scientific action acquire a new political and moral dimension that had previously seemed alien to techno-economic activity ... now the potential for structuring society migrates from the political system into the sub-political system of scientific, technological, and economic modernization. The political becomes non-political and the non-political political.... A revolu tion under the cloak of normality occurs, which escapes from possibilities of inter vention, but must all the same be justified and enforced against a public becoming critical. (1992, pp. 186-187) Strangely, then, deeper technological decisions made by specialists and experts to structure the economy and society around such "subpolitical systems of scientific, technological, and economic modernization" (Beck, 1992, p. 186) now transform the world without much, if any, effective state regulation, social planning, or systematic legitimation. On one level, following Lyotard (1979/1984), this firmly fixed formation to del egate decision making 24-7 to devices, systems, and lifestyles undercuts human ity's political practices. In this realm of the subpolitical, Lyotard saw science and technology leading into "another language game, in which the goal is no longer truth, but performativity—that is, the best possible input/output equation" (1979/ 1984, p. 46). Under these conditions, nature is reduced to the environment, so truth becomes intellectual capital, enlightenment turns into self-management, and pro gress is economic growth. Nature, in turn, loses its autonomy as it is subjected to serve in the overarching control of markets and technologies, whose mappings are performative. The Earth, then, no longer just exists or evolves as such. McKibben (1989) con ceded that it is instead left in the hands of scientific professionals with advanced technical training. Their labor now is dedicated to protecting, and enhancing, the performativity of the planet's diverse environments. Such work warns of threats as</page><page sequence="4">Luke / COLLECTIVE ACTION 205 well as advances possible solutions for lessening threats. Whatever surrounds our increasingly productive global economy, then, must also become as operationally adaptable, flexible, and productive as technicians can guarantee through the problem solving knowledges of riparian management, land rehabilitation, habitat evaluation, range economics, biotelemetic surveillance, wood engineering, resource interpre tation, or park planning. Forests, rangelands, waters, game animals, and soil all are redirected to serve as biotic components in planetary infrastructures. Their bioproduct undergirds the performativity of vast machineries for commodity pro duction, circulation, consumption, and accumulation. In turn, these machinic for mations are reshaping the unruly ecologies of Earth to suit mainly commercial requirements (Martin &amp; Schumann, 1997). As McKibben (1989) recounted, Arrhenius in Sweden during the 1880s or Callendar in England in the 1930s already had implicitly acknowledged how thor oughly most human ecologies on Earth are "a sociotechnical order." Carbon diox ide, chlorofluorocarbons, atmospheric ozone, and other chemicals are the bricks and mortar of this artificial world that, as Law (1991) suggested, pull together sys tems of humans and machines, animals and plants, economies and ecologies as our environment. Here, amid all of the mixed media of power and knowledge, "what appears to be social is partly technical. What we usually call technical is partly social. In practice nothing is purely technical. Neither is anything purely social" (Law, 1991, p. 10). Admitting to the end of nature, as McKibben does, requires rethinking how these webs in the environment work as terrestrial infrastructures. At the same time, it pushes McKibben and others to ask if today's professional technical experts in the fields of environmental science really can operate more equi tably and effectively as heterogeneous engineers for planetary self-management. That is, they must work "not only on inanimate physical materials, but on and through people, texts, devices, city councils, architectures, economics, and all the rest" (Law, 1991, p. 9) to somehow restore, as McKibben asked, "hope, human and wild." Here, McKibben's idealized construction of nature as an autonomous wil derness reads like the product of a very specific time and place, but it is still a pow erful and moving construct for many human beings seeking to situate themselves more justly and peacefully in the environment. This is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Nonetheless, as The End of Nature concludes, such restorative work is what now must be done. This work is a classic for posing them so eloquently and force fully, if even the most vexing political issues—who will do it, to whom, or for whom—are tougher questions that remain to be answered.
