<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES (I) * MARJORIE GRENE I The Two Theories 1959 will find the majority of Western biologists assenting with renewed enthusiasm to the basic principles enunciated a century ago in The Origin of Species. But there continues to be an heretical minority, and, moreover, the heretics speak with authority and vigour. When, in turn, the orthodox pause to answer the dissenters' arguments, they offer an illuminating paradigm of scientific controversy: illuminating both for a study of the nature of scientific disputes in general and for the epistemological problems inherent in evolutionary controversy in particular. I propose to limit myself here to the analysis of one such contro- versy: the disagreement between the theories of evolution stated by two palaeontologists, G. G. Simpson in Major Features of Evolution (1953) and 0. H. Schindewolf in Grundfragen der Paliiontologie (I950).1 Professor Simpson is the principal American spokesman of neo- Darwinism, or, as he now prefers to call it, the ' synthetic ' theory, and his Major Features is certainly one of the most carefully elaborated statements of this position.2 The very fact that he speaks as a palae- ontologist lends weight to that statement. Darwin himself had trouble with palaeontology; 3 and there have been palaeontologists ever since who have failed to adhere to the Darwinian position even * Received I3.i.I958 1x have drawn also to some extent on other writings of the same authors, notably G. G. Simpson's Meaning of Evolution (1949) and two addresses by Schindewolf: 'Evolution vom Standpunkt eines Paliontologen', Schweiz. Pal. Gesell., 1952, 374- 386, and 'Evolution im Lichte der Palliontologie', Comptes Rendus, Congrks Geol. Internat., 1954, 93-107. 2 It seems to me fair to call Simpson's theory neo-Darwinism if one recognises the differences introduced by the Mendelian basis of the newer type of theory. In essentials it is still Darwinism. 3 Origin of Species, Chapters X, and 6th edition, Chapter VII, answer to St George Mivart on abrupt transitions of form. IIO</page><page sequence="2">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES when it had become an orthodoxy. Darwinism-and in this neo- Darwinism is no different-presents a picture of life streaming endlessly forward, confined in this or that channel only by the combined effect of environmental change and natural selection, which selects the useful by breeding out the less useful. This picture, however, has seemed to some palaeontologists a distortion of the fossil record, and particularly in two ways.' First, the record itself is full of gaps; forms appear and disappear suddenly. There are a few famous transitional forms, like Archaeopteryx, but not nearly all there should be if evolution really happened as gradually as the Darwinians think. Secondly, such continuities as the fossil record does exhibit often seem to be unrelated to utility (or in modern language to adaptation) and hence to lie beyond the control of natural selection. The stock examples of this are found in the sabretooth tiger and the Irish elk. Respectively they have teeth or antlers that go on and on getting bigger and bigger even after they become a nuisance, and this was said to illustrate the phenomenon of 'orthogenesis '. This concept is still used by some scientists (including Schindewolf), but the problem it raises really forms part of a larger question: are there important phenomena in evolution which appear to be non-adaptive, and which, therefore, cannot be reasonably interpreted under the aegis of selection ? Up to recent years, at least, many palaeontologists thought there were such phenomena: they thought, in other words, that the concepts of adaptation and selection were not adequate for the interpretation of their subject matter. Against these opinions we have Simpson, himself a most distin- guished palaeontologist, the foremost living authority on equid history and a pioneer in work on rates of evolution, lending the weight of his authority to the neo-Darwinian view. He sees evolution as a contin- uous series of minute changes in innumerable directions, in which all alterations of any significance, larger as well as smaller, quicker as well as slower, are determined by the great co-operating 'pressures' of mutation, geographical isolation, and selection, with adaptation as the universal effect, and criterion, of systematic change. The basic concept, ultimately, is variation in the occurrence of genes; out of such variations all the systematic relations of living things have been gradually evolved. 1 See for example H. L. Hawkins, Rep. Brit. Ass. (Presidential Address to the Geological Section), 1936, pp. 57 et seq.; H. F. Osborn, U.S. Geol. Surv. Mon., 1929, 55; Am. Nat., 1934, 68, 193-235; L. F. Spath, Biol. Rev., 193 3, 81, 418-462. III</page><page sequence="3">MARJORIE GRENE There are a number of prominent biologists who are dissatisfied with this view; 1 Simpson, in Major Features, takes special pains to reply to the critique of one of them: the German palaeontologist Schindewolf; and it is with their disagreement that I propose to deal. Schindewolf finds the fossil record full of striking discontinuities, even where there can be no serious question of gaps in the record; new structures just suddenly turn up. Such new structures, moreover- for instance, the limbs of tetrapods-were not, he believes, in themselves adaptive. Land dwellers might have started with two legs, or half a dozen, or, octopus-like, with a ring of tentacles. How can we say that four is the best-adapted number, or that the pentadactyl ground-plan is the best-adapted pattern for such limbs in all the great variety of circumstances in which they have come to be used ? This happens to be the characteristic tetrapod 'Bauplan ', but there is no conceivable reason of utility why this number and no other, this blueprint and no other 2 should be found. Once present, of course, these four penta- dactyl limbs did indeed develop in specialised, adaptive ways: for running, digging, jumping, etc. Their common structure, however, was not in itself, in Schindewolf's view, an adaptation, it was simply a new type of organisation, four-footedness, capable of numerous and varied adaptations. Furthermore, Schindewolf agrees with the older palaeontologists that within each type, once it has appeared, there is a progressive, orthogenetic development. In fact, there is a rhythm analogous to that of birth, maturation, and senescence: the sudden appearance of a new type, its orthogenetic advance, and finally a stage of the breaking up of types which usually leads to extinction.8 The choice between a paraxonic and mesaxonic limb, for example, appears to be, from the point of view of adaptation, a matter of indifference. For speed of locomotion, either will do. Once the choice was made, however, there was a progressive, orthogenetic trend within each form, to the 1 may mention, in this country, four scientists who have expressed themselves as, in various ways, dissatisfied with the new synthesis (although I do not suggest that they would be in agreement, either with what I am saying here, or with one another): Professor H. Graham Cannon of Manchester, Professor Paul G. 'Espinasse of Hull, Professor Ronald Good of Hull, and Professor C. H. Waddington of the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh. 2 The same point is made in a different context in Professor Cannon's recent book, The Evolution of Living Things, Manchester, 1958. 3 Schindewolf calls these stages typogenesis, typostasis, and typolysis, and his theory as a whole typostrophism. 112</page><page sequence="4">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES horse on the one hand, and the camel on the other. The major type- i.e. the structural plan of artiodactyl as against perissodactyl limb- had to come first, and within this the development of specialised forms occurs-e.g. cows, pigs, and camels as against horses, rhinos, and elephants. Notice, moreover, that in each case the more general category appears first, and specialisation is specialisation within it. Whereas for Simpson it is a question of particular small changes adding up to big ones, for Schindewolf the big changes in structure come first, the new general structures breaking down thereafter into more special adapta- tions. This is related, as we shall see, to the fact that Schindewolf looks at structures first, putting morphology ahead of phylogeny, while Simpson, like all Darwinians, wants to make phylogeny-the history of life-the one foundation on which all the rest of biology is built. 2 Parallelism of the Two Theories We have here, then, a nicely balanced pair of theories: one stressing continuity and the adaptive character of all evolutionary change, the other stressing discontinuity (novelty of forms) and the non-adaptive character of major changes. The two writers disagree seldom, if at all, about the 'facts ', yet each rejects emphatically the other's inferences from the facts and is at pains to refute them. Con- sider briefly how the two views balance one another in this respect. (a) Sometimes the very same matter of fact seems to the two of them to provide evidence for diametrically opposite conclusions. For instance, the fact that some very old genera, like Lingula, still survive, is proof, for Simpson, that evolution does not exhibit the general pattern of racial life and death: it cannot be said to go on in a cyclical fashion if some old survivors are left happily in their ancient and well-established niches.' The same sort of fact is proof, for Schindewolf, that selection is by no means all-powerful, since if it were it would wipe out all simpler forms in favour of the more advanced, i.e. more efficient.2 (b) Each one accuses the other of committing the same or similar fallacies. About the question whether higher categories-orders, classes, phyla--originate before or after species, each one accuses the 1 Meaning of Evolution, p. 192; cf. Major Features of Evolution, p. 233 2 Grundfragen der Paldontologie, p. 404 113</page><page sequence="5">MARJORIE GRENE other, in nearly the same words, of arguing retrospectively, and reading into the record what he himself wants to put there.1 Did the class of birds originate, in one step, with Archaeopteryx, before the innumerable species and sub-species and varieties of birds had develop- ed ? Simpson says Archaeopteryx was a species like any other, originating by normal speciation from other reptilian species; only when we look back over the whole vista of evolution do we say, this particular species was the first of what has turned out to be a new class.2 Schindewolf says, Archaeopteryx is a bird: i.e. an animal that flies by means of feathers. There were never any before and there have been a great many since-but the transition, from class Reptilia to class Aves, happened then and there.3 The principle, flight by means of feathers, was genuinely new. Only the neo-Darwinians, late in time, come and conjure away its essential novelty. Or, again, each accuses the other of unnecessary and mystifying assumptions. Simpson considers that orthogenesis smacks of 'pur- posiveness ' 4-the worst possible name-calling in evolutionary contro- versy; and the division of the history of a type into stages analogous to birth, maturity, and old age, he considers viciously anthropomorphic and unjustified by the facts.5 Schindewolf, on the other hand, insists that while his use of orthogenesis and of the type concept is purely descriptive,6 nothing could be more mystifying than the prophetic vision of selection which the neo-Darwinians implicitly assume: the idea that selection selects what will be advantageous in another ten million years, and thus foresees advantages that will accrue to the remote descendants of the forms selected.7 True, a neo-Darwinian, accused thus baldly, would simply deny that he makes any such preposterous assumption. Selection, he says, selects what is useful in each generation, otherwise it would not be selected. There is no 'foresight' involved, but only the automatic and immediate control of variation through utility. Yet there is nevertheless some plausibility in Schindewolf's criticism ; for there are many cases in which Darwinians are forced to relax this basic principle, and to loosen the connection between adaptation and selection. It 1 Cf. ibid., p. 273, and Major Features of Evolution, p. 350 2 Major Features of Evolution, 342, 370; cf. pp. 347, 350 3 Grundfragen der Paldontologie, p. 126; cf. pp. 201, 277 4 Major Features of Evolution, p. 268 r Ibid., p. 233 6 Grundfragen der Paldontologie, pp. 430-43 1 7Ibid., pp. 413, 430-431 II4</page><page sequence="6">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES seems highly unlikely, for example, that the very minutest beginnings of ultimately co-adaptive structures, like the appendages of crustaceans, should have been of immediate and constant advantage to their bearers.1 What does neo-Darwinism make of such cases ? Sir Julian Huxley tells us that very slight selective values can now be seen to be effective, because evolutionary periods are so long.2 But can an incomprehensible happening become comprehensible by lasting a long time ? Either one is simply describing the direction of a trend that has already happened, and 'selection' is just shorthand for such a description, rather than an explanatory concept; or 'selection' stands for some mysterious force which controlled the whole process, in Dobzhansky's phrase (to quote another eminent neo-Darwinian), sub specie aeternitatis.3 This sounds suspiciously like Schindewolf's foresight of selection, as does Simpson's statement: ' it is certain that if we can see any advantage whatever in a small variation (and sometimes even if we cannot), selection sees more '.4 To return to Schindewolf: as against the highly abstract and hypothetical Darwinian theory, he makes the assumption: that life can originate novelty.5 This is, he says, a preferable assumption because it is simpler. He does not pretend to 'explain' this proposition, and in that sense it may be 'mysterious', but no more mysterious, he says, than physical concepts like ' force' or ' gravitation ' which everyone is prepared to accept as ' explanatory '-and not nearly so mysterious, he believes, as the whole nexus of assumptions implicit in the concept of 'natural selection' as the neo-Darwinians use it." (c) Finally, and most neatly characteristic of this type of situation, the two scientists argue in exactly opposite directions, each taking as his premiss the negation of the other's conclusion. Simpson, wedding palaeontology to the statistical methods of population genetics, sees a gradual change in populations such that the sharp divisions of tradi- tional morphology become false.7 Schindewolf, basing his theory on the logical priority of morphology, concludes that the gradualist, 1 A. Vandel, 'L'tvolution Consid&amp;re comme Phinomene de Diveloppement ', Bull. Soc. Zool. de France, 1954, 79, 341-356. Cf. L. Cuenot, L'Jvolution Biologique, 1951; 'L'Anti-hasard ', Rev.

To put it very schemati- cally; Simpson argues: the neo-Darwinian theory is true; mor- phology implies that neo-Darwinism is not true; therefore morphology is wrong. Schindewolf argues: morphology must first be accepted as true; morphology implies that the neo-Darwinian theory is wrong; therefore the neo-Darwinian theory is mistaken. Or to put the matter another way, they agree on their major premiss : traditional morphology and neo-Darwinism are incompatible. One says: Darwinism; therefore not morphology; the other says: morphology, therefore not Darwinism. In each book this argument-that is, in effect, the argument on the relative priority of morphology and phylogeny-comes late; but in each book it is a most decisive argument, which has been in fact moulding the shape each theory has taken all along. Why is it so decisive ? In neither case has a crucial experiment falsified the other theory. Nor is it merely that the two writers start from different premisses. But these different premisses, leading each to a conclusion directly contradicting the alternative premiss, are symptoms of a more pervasive difference, a difference in ways of thinking. To put it very simply, the two writers look at their material differently. It is this difference in ' looking ' that I want to analyse and in part to evaluate. 3 Planes of Disagreement When we consider the two theories a little more closely, we find that the differences between them are themselves of different kinds. Perhaps we may say that our two scientists disagree on different levels or planes of thought. There is, first, the verbal plane. They differ at many points simply in the formulation of observed phenomena or of their generalisations from them. Secondly, there is the visual plane. They use different sorts of visual imagery to support their theories; the models on which they rely are different in kind. Third, the plane of attention. They pay heed to different aspects of the phenomena. Different kinds of question interest them. Finally, and most funda- mentally, we come to the conceptual plane. Their 'outlook', the interpretive framework out of which they are looking at their material, is different.2 Here, and indeed on our second and third levels, we will 1 Grundfragen der Paliiontologie, pp. 300, 455 et seq., esp. p. 475 2 In terms of Professor Polanyi's philosophy of personal knowledge, the two are thinking on opposite sides of a logical gap; see M. Polayni, Personal Knowledge, London, 1958, pp. I5o-I6o. In terms of Professor Hodges' Riddell Lectures (Languages, Standpoints and Attitudes, Oxford, 1953), they differ existentially. ii6</page><page sequence="8">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES have moved beyond the range of differences specifiable in terms of vocabulary and syntax, to the more pervasive tacit component of theoretical knowledge.' 4 The Verbal Plane Consider, then, first, the verbal differences between the two theories -those differences which are specifiable in terms of vocabulary and syntax. The interesting thing about these differences is that when one looks at them hard, they disappear. It looks as if a great many statements in the two theories could be translated without loss of meaning one into the other. This does not mean that their disagree- ment is ' merely verbal '. On the contrary, if their statements were all translated into a common terminology, they would agree verbally but would still disagree. Let me mention briefly two examples of such verbal disputes. Simpson objects to ' orthogenesis' but speaks of 'essentially recti- linear evolution' , which is all that Schindewolf's 'orthogenesis' is shorthand for. Schindewolf insists that 'adaptation and genuine evolution are two quite different things ', yet in speaking of the origin of mammals he says this was a ' general improvement ' as distinct from the adaptations of particular groups of mammals to particular environ- ments-as the limbs of bats, whales, etc.3 But Simpson also distin- guishes between adaptations of a general and variable kind, and more limited and specialised adaptations-like the rodent's tooth.4 Why couldn't Schindewolf speak of 'general adaptations' instead of 'general improvement'? But he would be very angry at this suggestion, as Simpson would be if told that he might as well say 'orthogenesis' instead of 'essentially rectilinear evolution'.5 Obviously the verbal disagreement, which, in these and a number of other cases, could be easily eliminated, is relatively unimportant. It is the differ- ence that would remain in spite of verbal agreement that matters. 1 See Polanyi, op. cit. Part II, 'The Tacit Component'. 2 Major Features of Evolution, p. 259 3' Evol. vom Standpunkt eines Paliontologen', p. 382 4 Major Features ofEvolution, p. 346 5 See Simpson's note, ibid, p. 259: 'This means the same things descriptively as Schindewolf. . . means when he says that orthogenesis is characteristic of the typostatic phase of evolution, although I reject the theoretical implications of his statement as decisively as he rejects mine. 117</page><page sequence="9">MARJORIE GRENE 5 The Visual Plane Let us try, then, to look behind the verbal level of the dispute and consider the differences that underlie it. The two scientists, we said, look at the facts differently. They differ in the visual imagery by which their theories are supported. In Simpson's case the visualisation is at a relatively abstract level. Sometimes he uses graphs illustrating TAXONOMY: Equinae ern Hyracotherimae ,CB Late Miocene Late Oligocene Earli Oligocene) PHYLOGENY Eocene FIG. I. complex statistical relationships, sometimes models in the sense of cognitive maps. In Schindewolf's case it is usually, more directly, the actual shape of fossils that we are asked to envisage: these shapes and differences in shape illustrate -the relationships characteristic for evolution. Consider an example from each. Simpson (Fig. I) summarises the development of browsing and grazing types in equid phylogeny in II8</page><page sequence="10">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES terms of the 'selection landscape' technique introduced by Sewell Wright.1 Selection landscapes are constructed by applying abstract topological techniques to a wide range of data already subject to elaborate statistical manipulations. The result is a series of 'peaks' and 'valleys ', each peak representing an adaptive optimum for the characters and groups in question.2 In the case of horse evolution, we have two adaptive peaks, a browsing peak (B) and a grazing peak (G), with periods of shifting between them, and finally (not shown on this diagram) the disappearance of the browsing peak. Compare with this a diagram of Schindewolf's (Fig. 2)3, showing the development of one type of modern coral (f-h) from an early ontogenetic stage (b) of an ancient coral (a-e). It seems unlikely, if we look at (e) and (h), that a transition between them could have occurred by small cumulative steps. We could imagine, however, that in a young Pterocoral, the third pair of protosepta (c III) failed to develop, and instead (as is the case with modern Heterocorals), the second (fII) and then the first pair (g I) divided laterally, producing the four divisions (and other novelties in the arrangement of the sub- divisions) typical of the new kind of animal. This is something one sees intuitively, by looking at the actual shapes of fossil and recent corals at early and later stages of growth. 6 The Plane of Attention The difference in visualisation is symptomatic, further, of a difference of attention. The two are looking at different aspects of their common subject matter. What is central for one is peripheral for the other, and vice versa. Simpson is applying statistical methods in palaeontology, in close reliance on the theories of population genetics, which are also statistical. He is dealing, not with individuals, which do not evolve, but with populations, which do. Schindewolf is looking rather at individuals of different shapes and sizes, and the problem is to relate them phylogenetically; this can best be done in reliance on analogies drawn from embryology. From these different perspectives the same' facts 'look different. For example, Schindewolf 1 Based on Major Features of Evolution, p. 157 (Fig. 17).

Moreover, both agree that the transition in this case constitutes a sharp dividing line. Yet the different field of attention in each case puts such divergences into a very different context. Simpson is looking at gradual transitions in the genetical make-up of populations, while 1 Based on Grundfragen der Paliionotlogie, pp. 280-281 2 Major Features of Evolution, pp. 391-392 120</page><page sequence="12">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES Schindewolf is looking at changes in the structure of individuals, which often vary slightly though sharply, and between two such sharply divided varieties organisms fall easily into 'types '. Thus Simpson sees a sequence of particular changes building up to a generalised trend, Schindewolf a general pattern with lesser changes within it. Let us look more closely at Simpson's account. Populations, from the point of view of population genetics, are aggregates, not even of individual organisms, but of gene-complexes, tending to vary this way or that. A population is conceived in terms of its ' gene pool ', that is, the sum total of the genes of its members' germ cells. ' Genetical selection ' is the concept used to describe the systematic direction of the variation of genes, as distinct from drift, a minor factor, chiefly in small populations, which consists in fluctuations that fail to establish well-defined trends. Concepts such as ' threshold' or 'break- through' serve to facilitate the understanding of relatively abrupt shifts in such gradually changing trends; but what is of primary interest is the gradual change in the overall distribution of genes in interbreeding populations. That there was a first Eohippus or Meso- hippus or Equus is not nearly so interesting as the fact that there were gradually more. Attention to overall population trends, moreover, is supported by attention to the shifting organism/environment relationships-strictly speaking, gene-pool/environment relationships-which underlie them. Individual wholes are not of interest in this vision of pattern growing out of flux. And of course, it is primarily the ' mechanism ' of these innumerable small changes that population genetics has so successfully interpreted. Minute alterations in the material of heredity do tend to appear in experimental populations, and to perpetuate themselves. Such systematic change in hereditary material is called 'genetical selection', and selection is said to be the 'mechanism' by which such change happens. It is not, however, a 'mechanism' in terms of a cause-and-effect relationship, for the occurrences it correlates are random. Nor are internal laws of structure or development of interest to this kind of evolutionary thinking. Selection in the sense of popula- tion genetics is simply any systematic change, regardless of cause, in the make-up of the gene-pool of an actively interbreeding population. The occurrence of mutations being taken as random, selection is the settling of these random occurrences into statistically manageable averages. It is represented by the curve established by reading averages of gene frequently over a number of generations. Except in I I2I</page><page sequence="13">MARJORIE GRENE direct relation to reproduction, therefore, selection, in the sense of genetical selection, has no intrinsic relation even to adaptation. Simpson himself makes this quite plain. That such systematic change produces adaptation can be stated only on empirical evidence, or as a consequence of relaxing the strict genetical definition.' Schindewolf, on the other hand, is looking at the difference, say, in the shells of cephalopods or the structure of corals. The interesting point is not that the number of ammonites or of heterocorals came gradually to a peak, but that there were first ones, abruptly different from anything appearing in lower layers of fossil deposits. These changes cannot be interpreted as crystallising out of fluid gene-pool/ environment relationships, since they often appear when there is no evidence of significant environmental change. In fact, in Schindewolf's view, it is by the change in fossils that the succession of strata must be ordered, not vice versa. Moreover, the new types often show no perceptible difference in adaptive relations. In the history of corals, the change from six to four divisions is not a change in adaptation. It is just a change in plan. What we are looking at is a set of forms, macroscopic structures, Gestalten, which are in their nature discrete. The problem, for example, for the two types of coral, is to account for the continuity between them: and here the concept of early embryonic change (proterogenesis, or in English usage paedomorphosis) comes to our aid. Such change is also mentioned by Simpson, but concerns him little; for what interests him is the statistical trends in populations, not the life history of the individual embryo. Thus, though it is Simpson who seems to have moved beyond a succession of stable fossil forms to the genetic basis of evolution, it is Schindewolf who sees these stable forms as relics of living individuals and connects them, in imagination, through concrete, developmental stages rather than through abstract, statistical change. It is true that populations, not individuals, evolve; but populations are populations of individuals, 1 Dobzhansky, op. cit. pp. 79-80, equates 'adaptive value' with 'differential reproduction' (i.e. with genetical selection), thus concealing from the start the fact that the two are not conceptually equivalent. In this connection it is interesting that genetical selection is so often called the only known ' mechanism ' of evolution, when it is by definition not a mechanism at all, but a statistically established trend. (See e.g. Major Features of Evolution, pp. 144-146). Strictly speaking, the 'mechanism' resides in the mathematical skill of scientists like Fisher, Haldane, Wright and Simpson himself. It is only in the older and looser Darwinian sense that selection is genuinely a mechanism in nature. Dobzhansky's definition glosses over this difficulty; Simpson admits it at the start but tends to forget his admission. 122</page><page sequence="14">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES and something that happened in individual development must have underlain the abstract statistical relationships which population geneticists construct. It is this underlying real change that Schindewolf is trying to envisage. In other words, where Simpson interprets the palaeontological data in conjunction with the abstract generalisations of population genetics, Schindewolf relies on the embryologist's con- ception of individual development.' In short, looking at populations throughout evolutionary history, we see a series of ever-branching particular directions establishing relatively stable interplay of gene-complex/environment relations. Both these variables change continuously, and so does the result, statistically viewed, of the outcome of their interactions. Looking at individuals, we see a multiplicity of types, which, once there, adapt themselves to particular variations in environment, and of course die when they become mal-adapted; but the initial divergence in types is the fundamental, and irreducible, starting-point. For Simpson, evolutionary change consists in the 'break-through' of a population into a new 'zone '. This may occasionally happen as an all or none reaction, but not generally. The so-called explosive phase of evolution is usually just a speed-up of normal speciation 'due' to intensive selection pressure in a new 'zone '. For Schindewolf, evolutionary change occurs when a youthful animal takes a new turning on its ontogenetic course, and so, as Hardy puts it, ' escapes from specializa- tion', 2 with the result that something new-a new ground plan- appears which is withdrawn momentarily from the confining influence of selection, and proliferates, out of sheer exuberance, in all sorts of directions. 7 The Conceptual Plane Our two scientists, then, not only lean on different kinds of visual images as models, but look at different aspects of the phenomena. Why these differences ? Why do they use such different visual aids ? Why is their attention so differently directed ? The answer can be 1 In this connection see the important essays of A. Dalcq on ontomutations, 'L'Apport de l'embryologie causale au probleme de l'dvolution', Port. Acta. Biol. Vol. Jub. Goldschmidt, Coimbra, 1949, pp. 367-400, and 'Les Ontomutations a l'origine des mammifbres', Bull. de la Soc. Zool. de France, 1954, 79, 240-255; also A. Vandel, op. cit. 2 Sir Alistair Hardy in Huxley, Hardy, Ford, op. cit. pp. 122 et. seq. 123</page><page sequence="15">MARJORIE GRENE given only out of a third sense of' looking': what they are looking for, the general perspective out of which they look, is different. They get different answers from nature, in Kantian terms, because they are putting different questions: and they put different questions because they stand at different places in relation to their subject-matter: their 'outlook' is different. This may sound like playing with words: one can only see what one is looking at, and one only looks at what one is looking for. But consider our two cases in terms of this question: what are they lookingfor ? What is their outlook, their way of seeing ? That is really the most fundamental kind of difference, on which the differences in verbal usage, in visualisation, and in attention, all depend. Clearly, as I said at the beginning, Darwinism (and following it, neo-Darwinism) takes its stand firmly on the ground of continuity.1 It sees life, and ultimately matter, as continuous and therefore explicable, in the last analysis, in terms of a single set of principles. Schindewolf's sort of theory envisages a variety of types, a set of discrete wholes or patterns, in step-like arrangement. This simple alternative may seem to be contradicted by the statement of Dobzhansky (certainly among the most authoritative neo-Darwinians) that the most striking pheno- menon calling for explanation by the biologist is discontinuity.2 But actually Dobzhansky's statement confirms my interpretation: continuity is the fundamental framework within which neo-Darwinian biologists are thinking, and discontinuity is the surprise they must explain away. They have to show how out of continuity the actual existent discontinuity-the biological discreteness of species, genera, etc.--could have arisen. Schindewolf, starting with the discreteness of different morphological types, has to explain their continuity. For him the panorama of forms comes first, and since these do appear, in a series of strata, with increasingly complex novelties succeeding one another, it becomes necessary to explain how transitions could have happened, as Schindewolf certainly agrees they did, between such basically different forms. Hence, as we have seen, his interest in early embryological change, for in this kind of change one can envisage an abrupt alteration in structure which nevertheless takes account of the actual continuity in the successive generations of living things. Their disagreement about the relative priority of morphology and phylogeny lies close to the heart of the matter. Schindewolf looks 1 This is not, of course, a mathematical continuum, but a series of minute changes conceived as functions of continuously changing particulars. 2T. Dobzhansky, op. cit. pp. 3-4 124</page><page sequence="16">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES first at structure, and can't understand how anyone can look at phylogenetic relations without having first looked at structure. But the great vision of Darwinism is precisely the dissolution of stable forms into a continuum. What Darwin did was to unsettle the fixity of species, to make nature flow. If he threw Paley's watch into the middle of the ocean, life itself became that ocean; in Simpson's image of selection landscape: 'rising, falling, merging, separating, moving laterally, at times more like a choppy sea than like a static landscape '.' And once life is seen as flux, change in its ' forms ' is reduced to nearly imperceptible transition, the gradual elongation of the elephant's trunk or the gradual disappearance of the equid's extra toes, and so on. If, however, the stress on continuity is essential for neo-Darwinism, that conception alone is by no means definitive for the neo-Darwinian outlook. A Lamarckian theory would also stress continuity, through the gradual establishment of new techniques to meet new needs. A Lamarckian theory would also, of course, stress adaptation, which the Darwinian view, as against Schindewolf's, also emphasises. What differentiates the neo-Darwinian theory is the peculiar combination of three basic concepts: continuity, particulate inheritance (and mutation), and adaptation. What is this peculiar combination ? How do these three ideas hang together in the neo-Darwinian conception of evolu- tion ? First, let us examine the relationship between the particulate mechanisms of heredity and changes in heredity. This at first sight looks incompatible with the emphasis on continuity and gradualness of change and, of course, mutationism was for a while thought to contradict the basic Darwinian view. But as Fisher declared twenty- five years ago,2 the knowledge that mutations are the bearers of evolutionary change in fact proves the triumphant support, the very keystone, of neo-Darwinism, and the want of this knowledge was precisely what made Darwin's own position sometimes inconsistent. How, conceptually, do continuity and the particulate character of hereditary material go together ? In two ways. First, to think in terms of small building blocks, like genes, is to think in terms of parts, not wholes, or of populations of such parts, that is, of collections of particulars, which again are not wholes. Moreover, as we have seen, the populations of population genetics are not even collections of whole 1 Major Features of Evolution, p. 157 2 Sir Ronald Fisher, 'The Bearing of Genetics on Theories of Evolution ', Science Progress, 1932, 27, 273-287 125</page><page sequence="17">MARJORIE GRENE organisms, but collections of gene complexes, and a gene complex, again, is a sum of independent particulars. Even though its effect be conceived as integrated, in its constitution it is of a mosaic rather than a comprehensive kind. It is not an organic whole, but ajuxtaposition of small discrete particulars. In short, both types of concept: continuous variation or change, and particulate inheritance with its minute though discrete alterations are, precisely, devices for not looking at wholes or Gestalten or structures: for reducing organic structure, on the one hand, to values of continuous functions, and on the other, to collections of minute particulars. Here, I believe, we really meet the ruling passion of Darwinism: in the determination not to look at structure. Structure must be explained away; it must be reduced to the conditions out of which it arose rather than acknowledged as structure in itself. This first part of the answer is negative, and admittedly does not take us far, since particulate pattern and continuity are so obviously discordant conceptions. The second part, however, is positive: this is where population genetics steps in to reconcile the discrete and the continuous. It is a most powerful instrument for synthesis since, statistically handled, collections of genes, which are particulate, do nevertheless vary continuously. Combined with Mendelian statistics -which are themselves grounded in a particulate, non-structural view of the nature of organisms-the statistical methods of population genetics allow one, therefore, to view the fluctuations in Mendelian statistics (which appear as the changing average of the relative frequency of one gene over its alternative in interbreeding populations) as producing a continuous process of evolutionary change. Nor is that all. Statistical calculations of rates of evolution, the construction of adaptive peaks and valleys, etc., which are included in the apparatus of population genetics, allow one to construct a highly abstract quasi- structure which appears to introduce a satisfactory-because abstract -pattern into an otherwise unintelligible flux. What about adaptation ? Again, the central role assigned this concept does not follow from the concept of continuity in itself. Leibniz saw the world as a continuous array of degrees of perception, not of adaptations. In fact, it seems odd that the very theorists who most emphatically deny any shred of purposiveness to nature, should just as emphatically declare that all significant changes in nature are adaptive in character. But the stress on adaptation falls into place once one takes the refusal to look directly at structure as fundamental. It is the shifting organism/environment relation, not the form of the I26</page><page sequence="18">TWO EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES organism itself, that is the basic unit. Organisms, already dissolved, from the perspective of evolution, into gene complexes, are themselves constantly changing as an (equally changing) environment plays upon them. Thus what changes is itself a product of two variables: average gene frequency and environment. There are no constants which would have to be assessed as patterns or achievements in themselves, only what Simpson calls the 'splendid opportunism' of life. This is indeed a brilliant perpetuation of Darwin's vision, and its persuasive force is compelling. Schindewolf's principles are simpler. He sees typical shapes, and he sees again and again what appear to be new shapes. Therefore he assumes that living things are able to originate novel types. Mutation, he agrees, must have been the mechanism by which they originated; but the adaptive control of mutation occurs only within, not between types. The basic pattern is of change from type to type, and always, as we have seen, with the more general appearing before its specialised subdivisions. We cannot, in fact, describe specialisation except within a more general type: there must be some kind to become specialised.1 First we have types, then we acknowledge the origination of new types. Within these, there is an inner dynamic of fulfilment: orthogenesis, and at the same time radiation into specialised subtypes controlled by adapta- tion and selection--the last and least creative steps, leading each time to an evolutionary cul-de-sac, whether as with Lingula to arrested evolution or, as with the majority of species, to extinction.
