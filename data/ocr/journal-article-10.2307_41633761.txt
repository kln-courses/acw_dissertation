<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire in Chinese Ritual and Society P. Steven Sangren Abstract: For many Western observers, Chinese religion and cosmology appear rife with contradictions, among them the recurrent motif in litera- ture and myth of preordination or fate, on the one hand, and a relentless attempt, through ritual means, to discern, control, or change fate, on the other. This article argues that the obsession with fate and luck is best comprehended with reference to desire understood as a human universal. Underlying one's hope to control the future lies a psychologically more fundamental wish to claim ownership of one's being. I argue that fate and luck are operators in a symbolic economy that implicitly posits what Freud terms the 'omnipotence of thoughts'. Moreover, if the underlying principle of Chinese notions of fate and luck can be termed an 'economy of desire', it is a principle that also coordinates and encompasses Chinese patriliny, family dynamics, and wider collective institutions. Keywords: China, desire, family, fate, karma, psychoanalysis, ritual Chinese religion and cosmology, in the view of many Western observers, seem to contain many contradictions.1 Among the most striking is the recurrent theme in myth and literature of preordination or fate ( tianming ^ 1%; tianshu ^ Ü0, on the one hand, and a determined effort, through ritual means, to discern, control, or change fate, on the other. If fate is immutable, why is so much energy devoted to something beyond one's control? This article argues that obsession with luck and fate, although certainly a distinguishing characteristic of Chinese culture, is best understood with reference to desire as a human universal. Beneath the wish to control the future, whose rationale is apparently self-evident, lies a psy- chologically more fundamental desire to claim ownership of one's being - or, in contemporary parlance, to assert agency. I argue that, in China, concern with fate is a culturally particular variant of this general human concern. Consequently, instead of focusing on native concepts of fate or luck (yunS), I argue that these ideas are better understood within a larger context encompassing Social Analysis, Volume 56, Issue 2, Summer 2012, 11 7-135 © Berghahn Journals doi: 10. 3167/sa. 2012. 560209</page><page sequence="2">118 I P. Steven Sangren the "moral constitution of personhood [and the] symbolic reproduction of the household," as expressed by one of the editors of these special issues (da Col 2012: 2). Fate and luck are operators in a symbolic economy that posits, although elliptically, what Freud (1995: 87) terms the "omnipotence of thoughts" or wishes. Moreover, if we conceive of the underlying principle of Chinese notions of fate and luck as an 'economy of desire', it is a principle that also incorporates and encompasses Chinese family dynamics, patriliny, and wider collective insti- tutions, including Buddhism and, in imperial times, the state. In the interests of discerning issues of general concern to anthropology, I hazard some additional speculations that might not seem, at least initially, to be directly relevant to the topic of fate, per se. I do so in part because this theme is already so well-traveled in Chinese philosophy and ethnography, and in part because I am less interested in the Chinese concept of fate as a factum of (let us call it) ethno-philosophy than I am in locating fate in the broader terrain of Chinese culture and in comparative anthropology. Shifting focus from an ethno-philosophy of fate per se to desire understood as that which defines a general human condition brings us closer to understanding and to explaining both fate's specifically Chinese valences and the affinity of Chinese constructions to those found elsewhere. In this critical spirit, I suggest that, in the absence of explicit discussion linking culturally particular institutions or concepts to human commonalities, it is less than clear exactly what vari- ous expositions of concepts, meanings, cultural constructions, or categories in addition to fate- for example, the person, gender, the supernatural- actually tell us about cultures. Fate as Pragmatic Accommodation to Life's Vicissitudes I proceed by juxtaposing disparate reference points whose linkages become evident as the argument develops. First, the salience of fate in Chinese popular culture has been noted by many scholars. Stevan Harrell (1987) provides a use- ful summary of such observations, augmented by his own ethnographic inves- tigations in an article focusing on the topic.2 Like a number of those whom he cites, Harrell wonders how it is that Chinese frequently refer to fate as though one's destiny were beyond one's control, on the one hand, while, on the other hand, they seem to think of themselves as a particularly hard-working, ener- getic people, possessed of a strong work ethic: if one's fate is immutable, why would people strive so hard to succeed?3 Harrell (ibid.: 101) concludes: Casually, [fate] is nothing but a description of someone's existence, comfortable or uncomfortable. Theoretically, it is a kind of predetermination according to the harmony or disharmony of cosmic forces, something that is both immutable and predictable by an expert who knows the code. But practically, it is more than anything a kind of post-hoc rationalization, a catchall explanation when oth- ers fail, a way of acknowledging that even the most moral and diligent human beings cannot necessarily guarantee their own success in life. In this sense, ming or mia : really does mean "life."</page><page sequence="3">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 119 Harrell argues further that whatever theoretical, philosophical, or theological 'beliefs' or 'meanings' are associated with fate, the Chinese in fact employ the 'concept' pragmatically to bridge the inconsistency between fate as predestina- tion and the moral or psychological imperative to strive. I bracket 'concept', 'belief', and 'meaning' in quotation marks to draw attention to the fact that such categories, widely employed in ethnographic analysis, embody assump- tions with respect to how we understand culture that I aim to question. Harrell's ethnographic generalizations align with Wing-tsit Chan's (1963: 78-79) pithy summary of Chinese philosophical discourses: In ancient China there were five theories about destiny or the Mandate of Heaven. The first was fatalism: the Mandate of Heaven is fixed and unchangeable. The second was moral determinism: Heaven always encourages virtue and punishes evil; therefore, man can determine his reward and punishment through moral deeds. The third was anti-fatalism, advocated by the Moist School ... The fourth was naturalistic fatalism, which means that destiny is not controlled by Heaven in the sense of an anthropomorphic God but by Nature and works automatically. Lastly, there was the Confucian theory of "waiting for destiny." According to this doctrine, man should exert his utmost in moral endeavor and leave whatever is beyond our control to fate. It frankly admits that there are things beyond our control but that is no reason why one should relax in his moral endeavor. The tendency was definitely one of moralism and humanism. The Confucian theory represents the conviction of enlightened Chinese in general. My own ethnographic research and experiences in Taiwan and China arrive at much the same impressions as do Harrell's ethnographic overview and Chan's philosophical summary. Nonetheless, I do not believe that noting the practical advantages or effects of a concept- in this instance, fate- altogether exhausts or resolves all of the interesting issues raised by the paradox that Harrell poses. Moreover, Harrell's dispensing of the philosophical issues in the name of Chinese pragmatism and Chan's affirmation of the reasonableness of Confucian humanism leave unaddressed the enduring prevalence of fortune- telling, luck, gambling, divination, and kindred practices so distinctive of Chinese culture. Paul Festa's (2007) close reading of mahjong as a 'ritual mode of male agency' anticipates this point. Mahjong, he argues, is a form of agonistic com- petition that hinges "on negotiating a tense dialectic between agency and fate" (ibid.: 100) that "simultaneously suspends agency and disavows the abeyance of agency" (ibid.: 113). Donald Hatfield (2002) provides another insightful analysis of the role of fate, arguing that the discourse of fate discernible in Taiwanese divinatory practices constitutes a complex but implicit and unin- tended suturing of individual existential concerns to productive and reproduc- tive processes that find institutional form in families and communities. Both analyses imply that comprehending the peculiarly Chinese fascination with fate, divination, and gambling raises fundamentally human existential issues. My purpose here is to recruit a psychoanalytically informed focus on desire explicitly toward elaborating this connection.</page><page sequence="4">120 I P. Steven Sangren Karma Karma (yinguo 13 Ji:)- the 'Buddhisť notion of moral cause and effect- is a con- cept that is arguably as prevalent in China as is fate, and it is often invoked by Chinese in terms similar to those Harrell (1987) outlines with respect to fate. Again, I bracket 'Buddhism' in quotation marks to register a reservation with respect to any implication that karma might be considered any less Chinese than fate. Although Buddhism's textual origins are, of course, South Asian, it makes little sense to view Buddhism as foreign, given its assimilation into Chinese culture over the course of some 1,500 years. Indeed, although this is not the context to belabor these issues, the very term 'Buddhisnť may be mis- leading insofar as it implies a discrete, stable, and clearly identifiable segment within Chinese culture as a whole.4 Like fate, karma figures prominently in expressive culture and, at first glance, might seem at some odds with it. In particular, in popular Chinese thought, karma entails the idea that good deeds are rewarded and bad ones punished- if not in this life, then certainly in one's subsequent reincarnations. Put in these terms, karma implies that by accumulating merit ( gongde Í0ÍÜ) people possess control over their fates. Yet things are not quite so simple. As Harrell notes with respect to fate, so, too, is karma invoked to explain (as the old saw has it) how bad things happen to (at least apparently) good people. In popular religious literature {shanshn ^ Hf), karma punishes not only for transgressions in this life, but also for those committed in previous incarnations. Because the memory of past lives is erased at rebirth, people have no knowledge of their crimes from past lives.5 Conse- quently, at least as far as living memory is concerned, one may have little more control over the effects of karma than over those of fate. Notably, karma is cited in contexts identical to those in which fate is invoked as the explanation for why things do not develop as one might wish or expect. In the same vein, just as Harrell notes that belief in fate does not diminish people's interest in discerning it or, indeed, their active pursuit of success, neither does karma inspire anything akin to fatalism or apathy. Yet, unlike fate, one can in principle increase one's karmic account by performing good works ( xiude íl^ífO-6 1 juxtapose karma and fate not so much to compare how they are conceived, however, as to set the stage for an argument to the effect that both notions register a more general concern revolving around desire and agency. Skepticism/Pragmatism Harrell (1987) notes that although many Chinese informants claim a belief in fate, they are equally likely to express considerable skepticism with respect to whether any of myriad divinatory practices can actually discern or foretell it. Festa (2007), too, observes that Taiwanese men dislike divination but in mahjong play seem fascinated with luck. In a similar vein, Holmes Welch (1967: 121) quotes a skeptical abbot of Qixia Shan Monastery: "Of course ... divination by</page><page sequence="5">Fate, Agency , and the Economy of Desire | 121 bamboo slips was useless, since it did not change the future of the worshipper, which was determined by the karma of his deeds. Nonetheless, it appealed to weak people. Although we did not encourage it, we had to tolerate it as a popu- lar custom. There was scarcely a monastery or temple, large or small, that did not have a tube of bamboo slips in one of its shrine-halls." My own experiences confirm these observations; indeed, divination is one of the most common activities in most Taiwanese temples. Yet as the case of Welch's abbot suggests, one encounters a spectrum of opinion among Chinese. Some are enthusiastic, even obsessive, seekers of knowledge about one's fate, whereas others are skep- tics who are altogether contemptuous of those so obsessed. For most, as Harrell (1987: 99) puts it, "[w]hen entrepreneurial and moral values fail to explain, fate [or karma] comes in, and reinforces the worth of the entrepreneurial values." In sum, Harrell's depiction of his informants' views- views shared by the Buddhist abbot and what Chan terms "enlightened Chinese in general"- boils down to the pragmatic notion that some things are beyond our control, includ- ing even, and perhaps especially, circumstances that we strive to master. To believe in fate may suggest little more than giving a name to this truism. But because we cannot really know fate or karma, acknowledging its efficacy has little practical effect. Harrell (1987: 98) cites the Chinese proverb ren qin, di bulan (if people are energetic, the land will not be lazy)- roughly equivalent (I suggest) to "God helps those who help themselves"- to illustrate the essential practicality with respect to these issues prevalent in Chinese soci- ety. In the final analysis, most avow belief in fate, even in its immutability, but this belief seldom leads to fatalism because equally prevalent is skepticism with respect to whether one can actually know or discover fate in advance of events. Since one cannot know one's fate, it need not influence one's actions. Max Weber, Clifford Geertz, and Interpretive Social Science Harrell's juxtaposing of fate and entrepreneurial spirit in China brings to mind Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1958), specifically Weber's argument to the effect that it was precisely anxiety regarding predes- tination that motivated early Calvinists toward acetic accumulation. Weber's interest in understanding why capitalism emerged in the West and not in China7 is of less interest here than is his explicitly comparative approach to Chinese civilization (Weber 1951). This broader problematic in Weber's oeuvre revolves around the relationship between cultural or historical particularities and human commonalities. In anthropology, Weber's influence has been most evident in the hermeneu- tic or interpretivist approach, epitomized in the writings of Clifford Geertz.8 Indeed, Geertz often cites Weber as inspiration for his own advocacy of inter- pretive social science. Having come of age as an anthropologist during the heyday of this tradition, I am (of course) both formed by and resistant to it. In particular, the dominant anthropological project among my professional contemporaries follows Geertz in focusing attention on cultural differences</page><page sequence="6">122 I P. Steven Sangren or particularities. Although both Geertz and Weber are aware of and make reference to what might be termed common human concerns, in practice the analytical-cum-polemical emphasis of the interpretive turn, at least in anthro- pology, has been the elaboration of cultural differences.9 In this vein, interpretive anthropology's pedagogical mission has been to convince the rest of the world that what we take to be natural, universal, or essential categories- for example, gender, kinship, individuality, personhood, even emotions- are actually culturally constituted or constructed.10 I return here to a recurring resistance in my previous work to this interpretive turn: my complaint is not so much that interpretive or hermeneutic approaches deny the universais or commonalities of human experience as that these com- monalities are taken as self-evident, in little need of explicit elaboration or justification. Anthropology and especially ethnography thus become defined as what Geertz (1973d) famously terms 'thick description' or interpretation more than explanation of or a search for common properties of social process. Although seldom employing precisely Geertzian terminology, cultural particu- larism persists in more contemporary rubrics like 'knowledge production' and 'radical empiricism'. Consequently, I wish distinguish my argument explicitly from such emphases.11 Weber, more than Geertz, is in fact devoted to developing general principles of social life. Of particular relevance here is Weber's interest in theodicy. As Segal (1999: 67) summarizes: "Since all human beings for Weber recognize the discrepancy between their expectations and their experience, all harbour the potential desire for meaning." Weber (1978: 518-529) famously distinguishes several ideal types with respect to the problem of suffering or theodicy specifi- cally in order to distinguish civilizations with reference to a common existen- tial concern. Although Weber assumes that all human beings are aware of the discrepancy between their expectations and their experience (as Segal frames it), his comparative project focuses mainly on how this commonality takes dif- ferent shapes in 'higher religions'. Beyond demonstrating the fundamental productive power of culture, Geertz seems less interested than Weber in specifying analytically the nature of human commonalities (see Geertz 1966b, 1973d; Segal 1999). As one of Geertz's (1966a: 96) many frequently quoted aphorisms has it: "[M]en unmodified by the customs of particular places do not in fact exist, have never existed, and most important, could not in the very nature of the case exist." In the same essay, he adds: "One of the most significant facts about us may finally be that we all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but end in the end having lived only one" (ibid.: 45). What Geertz is driving at, of course, is that it is in our (human) nature to be culturally constructed, a point with which I wholeheartedly agree. Yet in making this point, Geertz implicitly downplays how inquiry into human commonalities as well as differences is an essential part of the anthropological project. Human nature anticipates culture; cultures differ; there as many human natures as there are cultures - or so the Geertzian algorithm supposes. Returning to contemporary anthropology, then, to understand culture is to understand the particular meanings, concepts, or</page><page sequence="7">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 123 constructions that ethnography discovers in the publicly accessible symbol systems, assumptions, or languages encountered in our research.12 I do not propose to examine closely the analytical uses of meaning in Geertz, Weber, or kindred interpretive approaches here; instead, I propose that a shift in focus from meaning as elaborated in interpretive anthropology to desire as a category of analysis inspired mainly by psychoanalytic theory is a more illu- minating approach to understanding fate both comparatively and as a specific element of Chinese culture. Among other advantages, a focus on desire invites us to think in terms of human commonalities, whereas focusing on meaning encourages an emphasis on particularity or difference. Mindful of these concerns, let us return to Harrell's (1987) depiction of folk conceptions of fate. Much of the appeal of Harrell's formulation is that it not only makes Chinese employments of fate seem practical, it also makes Chinese attitudes toward any discrepancy between their expectations and their experi- ence seem quite familiar- there is nothing particularly exotic about fate so depicted. In other words, Harrell, too, appeals implicitly to common human experience. It seems all but self-evident that people (implicitly everywhere) would wish to control life's vicissitudes while at the same time recognizing that they cannot always do so. The fact that even good or virtuous behavior fails to produce the desired effects or rewards lies at the heart of theodicy and, at least for Weber, the problem of meaning. In other words, the apparent contradiction between fate as predetermination and agency, as discernible in Chinese thinking, is not altogether unfamiliar to us. Recall that Weber's early Calvinists were also vexed by the notion that God's omnipotence implied human impotence, but (like the Chinese) they avoided wallowing in fatalism, striving instead to demonstrate their own membership in the 'elect'. Although Chinese cosmology lacks anything akin to the Calvinist doctrine of 'election', I believe one can perceive something broadly similar in a diffuse wish to think of oneself as being favored by heaven. For example, one might express pity toward an unfortunate contemporary in the third person ( ta hen daomei 'he/she is very unfortunate'), but to address someone in the second person in such terms [ni hen daomei 'you are very unfortunate') might be considered insulting and a comment not only upon one's luck but also upon the moral state of one's being. Festa's analysis of mahjong can be recruited to exemplify this tension between pragmatic accommodation to the reality principle defined by the limits of control and the wish for or assertion of self-possession. In mahjong's liminal 'deep play' of high-stakes gambling, anxiety regarding agency and control is, he argues, simultaneously expressed and repressed, an accomplishment facilitated by the strenuous rules of etiquette that define play as distinct from secular time and identity and by the trance-like abeyance of agency fostered by the temporal rhythm of play. According to Festa (2007: 112), Taiwanese "men are keenly con- cerned about their fates, but [unlike women] tend to eschew conventional forms of divination." Moreover, because "Taiwanese men are socially conditioned to be in control and assertive, to shun mystery in favor of mastery," "men prefer to divine fate through mahjong, where they 'forget' to suspend agency and muster</page><page sequence="8">124 I P. Steven Sangren strategy, skill, and expressive style to finagle 'luck' ( shouqi or yunqi), which becomes ... each player's ultimate object of contestation" (ibid.: 113). 13 My point is not to argue that Calvinist angst is discernible in China, too, but rather to suggest that Chinese attitudes toward fate are intelligible not only, as Weber or Geertz might argue, when put into meaningful (i.e., culturally particu- lar) context, but also with reference to desire understood as that which defines the human condition. To better make this case, however, let us turn to Freud, psychoanalysis, and the ontology of desire. Freud and the Omnipotence of Thoughts In Totem and Taboo, Freud (1950: 110) proposes an evolutionary typology of human attitudes toward reality: At the animistic stage men ascribe omnipotence to themselves. At the religious stage they transfer it to the gods but do not seriously abandon it themselves, for they reserve the power of influencing the gods in a variety of ways according to their wishes. The scientific view of the universe no longer affords any room for human omnipotence; men have acknowledged their smallness and submitted resignedly to death and to the other necessities of nature. None the less some of the primitive belief in omnipotence still survives in men's faith in the power of the human mind, taking account, as it does, of the laws of reality. Although Freud certainly overstates the degree to which the 'scientific view' transcends primitive belief in 'omnipotence', he nonetheless registers what I take to be a more robust general insight to the effect that the wish (if not belief) that we might have things as we would- that is, the wish for omnipotence- is never seriously abandoned. Perhaps 'omnipotence' is not the best term here, insofar as it suggests that people desire to control everything. I propose instead that, at least implicitly, among those things that people wish most to control is who and what they are.14 This speculation leads to the crux of my hypothesis: fate, theodicy, and kin- dred religious-cum-existential conundrums seem to boil down most fundamen- tally to our realization that we do not, in fact, wholly control who and what we are or shall become (a reality principle), yet the nature of desire ordains that we cannot 'seriously' abandon or forswear the wish that we could (a pleasure principle). To clarify, by referencing the concept of controlling who and what we are, I have in mind what I take to be a general existential problem that is closely linked to desire. In other words, desire understood in these terms manifests what in anthropology was once more broadly invoked as the 'psychic unity of humankind'.15 I can outline only briefly what I have in mind here. One of Freud's lasting accomplishments is the attention that psychoanalysis brings to the ontology of desire. Contemporary theory influenced by Freud and (especially in this regard) Lacan is quite critical of Freud's problematic and reductive assumptions with respect to instincts. Nonetheless, Freud's insight that desire is neither wholly</page><page sequence="9">Fate , Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 125 cultural nor wholly material or biological, but is rather an emergent effect of human beings' entry into a 'natural' world that is always socially organized withstands such critique.16 By the same token, one need not accept Freud's contention that frustration of infants' allegedly natural, libidinal attachments to their mothers is the origin of desire to see in this problematic framing a more general and valuable insight. To elaborate, less in Freud's explicit development of his ideas surrounding the Oedi- pus complex than in the broader contextualization of desire's coming into being, desire appears as precisely that (to invoke Segal's felicitous wording again) which registers "the discrepancy between ... expectations and ... experience." In Lacan, this point becomes clearer by becoming more abstract and (argu- ably) less biological. For Lacan, the Oedipus complex revolves less around the father as a real-world rival, who frustrates the infant's lust for its mother, than around the 'father' as the circumstantial (although not altogether arbitrary) representative of the limitations imposed by a socially constituted world. The Oedipal situation, in other words, is not only a socially and materially effective scene of production of desire and, hence, our personhood, it is also a more abstract template, potentially applicable to variant cultural formulations, for any 'coming into being' of desire. The functionality of the father would exist, in principle, whether or not any father is actually present because the father, in effect, stands in for society. The fact that we must all accommodate to a world in which others' desires constrain us is constitutive of human experi- ence and, at the same time, the crucible of desire. Human experience is, of course, always culturally particular in its manifestations, but no less universal for its particularities. In sum, desire is an emergent effect of our encounter with precisely the fact that we are not omnipotent; it comes most humanly into being from the expe- rience of (especially) social limits. Although we are not, especially socially, omnipotent (and I extrapolate here from Freud's 'omnipotence of thoughts'), we never abandon the wish that we were.17 Desire incorporates this wish and manifests in fantasy, myth, and (I have argued) even in social institutions like the family or patriliny (Sangren 2006) . Among the most profound or abstract obstacles to desire- and, hence, to producers of desire- are existential con- cerns revolving around birth, death, and our own being, insofar as such self- evident insults to omnipotence bespeak not only our inability to control things that happen to us, but also bring implicitly into question whether we are ourselves authors or agents of our own desire or merely products or effects of forces or agencies that we do not control. The Omnipotence of Thoughts in Chinese Ritual and Cosmology If one accepts the notion that desire defines the human condition, then it is not surprising that the foregoing abstractly denoted philosophical concerns are discernible in the rhetoric of many Chinese rituals and beliefs. In ancestor worship, funerary practices, and imperial rituals, one can observe a complex</page><page sequence="10">126 I P. Steven Sangren ambivalence similar to that evident in attitudes toward fate. In particular, in the rhetoric of ritual the ultimate locus of agency regarding creation or production is crucially ambiguous. I shall not rehearse in detail here arguments that I have made elsewhere, the crux being that many rituals entail an agent's invocation (in a sense, production) of a transcendent imaginary - heaven ( tian ^), prior heaven [xiantian 5te^), the ancestors t zuxian ISJfc)- represented as though this imaginary, a product of the ritual agent's imagining, were (although implicitly) the producer of the agent himself (Sangren 2000a). Because the imaginary to which such omnipotence is attributed is itself a product of the ritual agent's imagination, we have here a clear instance of Freud's omnipo- tence of thoughts.18 1 say "clear," but the hubris of ritual is veiled by indirec- tion: the ritual produces an imaginary that itself is represented as having, in effect, produced the ritualist/agent. This wish for omnipotence profoundly informs such characteristically Chi- nese institutions as patriliny (encompassing gender ideology, descent, ancestor worship, and family dynamics) as well as what Angela Zito (1997) has termed the Chinese 'impérium'. To cite just one brief example, Chinese patriliny as an ideological formation diminishes to the point of denying what might be termed the facts of life, especially with respect to women's contributions to biological and social production. From the vantage of patriliny, women are problematic, polluting, because the fact that they give birth embarrasses or subverts the fantasy or conceit of autonomy otherwise valorized in institutions like ancestor worship and imperial sacrifice. How can one be the authentic (in the sense of original, independent) author of one's own being if one has been born? I could go on in this vein (and, indeed, have done so at considerable length),19 but the crucial point is that fantasy inevitably confronts, as Freud would put it, the 'reality principle'. In the Chinese case, obvious realities include birth and death, but also, from the point of view of Chinese sons and daughters, the con- straints constituted by family and kinship. These very constraints are themselves instituted fantasies that imagine the ritual agent (patriarch/emperor in the per- sonage of the filial son) to be the omnipotent producer of- most crucially, yet elliptically- himself. The ironic consequence of this hubristic imaginary is to produce the very realities of authority, domination, and even exploitation that frustrate and pro- voke the desires and fantasies of the ritual-protagonists' sons and daughters. As son-sacrificers in the rites of ancestor worship, Chinese patriarchs produce themselves as instruments of established authority over their families by repre- senting themselves as abjectly subordinate to imagined powers - ancestors and gods- imaginatively constructed in the same ritual-cum-representing activi- ties. Cultures, I am convinced, are inherently characterized by an interplay of fantasy and reality of similarly ironic form: attempting to fulfill desires, people produce, bring into being, realize institutional arrangements that obstruct and, thus, produce others' desires. Note that in making this assertion, I propose that fantasy be understood not as something confined solely to psychodynamic pro- cess, but also as inhabiting the very institutional frameworks that Freud (1961) opposed to desire in Civilization and Its Discontents.20 1 am also suggesting that</page><page sequence="11">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 127 to approach culture as a text or straightforwardly accessible system of symbols or meanings, interpretable by variously describing its pivotal concepts, sub- stantially misconstrues what culture in fact is and cannot adequately accom- modate the internal or ironic complexity inherent even in concepts such as, in the present instance, fate. The Authenticity of Fortune-Tellers My argument might become clearer by shifting the discussion from the preced- ing abstract analysis of patriliny to a more prosaic ethnographic scene - to wit, the debates, enjoyed by many Chinese, about the authenticity or powers of fortune-tellers. Even among my most analytically sophisticated anthropological colleagues in Taiwan, I have encountered ambivalence with regard to whether or not access to uncanny powers is possible. I can recall several occasions in which groups of young Taiwanese anthropologists, discussing the claims of spirit-mediums to discern fate, agreed that most such mediums are con artists, that they mislead their clients (pianren IBA), that their claims are far-fetched, and that their feats are explainable in terms other than access to unseen forces. Nonetheless, such conversations were inevitably punctuated by references to instances of encounters with uncannily 'accurate' (zhun ^P) fortune-tellers. Interest in and experience with various forms of fortune-telling is all but ubiquitous (at least in Taiwan), even among the best educated and apparently skeptical. Most bookstores feature substantial sections devoted to various types of fortune-telling, filling a niche similar to the 'self-help' sections found in American bookstores. There is much of potential anthropological interest in these materials, but I wish to draw particular attention to how fortune-telling seems to implicate not only a desire to discern one's future but a broader dis- course on the technology of the person. To return to the anecdotes about uncannily accurate fortune-tellers, evi- dence of uncanniness usually involves not so much the fortune-teller's abil- ity to predict successfully the future but rather the fortune-teller's ability to discern something about the interlocutor that could not possibly have been known except by supernatural means. Testimonials include, for example, "The fortune-teller knew that I was born in the year of the horse and that I had recently broken up with my boyfriend" or "The fortune-teller knew that I had failed the college entrance exams and asked whether I planned to study an additional year to try again," and so forth. Inevitably, narrators followed such anecdotes by emphatically denying the possibility of any 'rational' explanation that might account for the prognosticator's knowledge. Note that I am glossing here not a single, actual conversation but rather a recurring narrative- one that recurs to the point that its form is predictable, stereotypic, a clearly recognizable cultural trope. Note as well that such narra- tives revolve around accuracy [zhun ?H) as proof of authenticity or truth (jen JQ and that the measure of both accuracy and authenticity is - a key point - intrinsically linked to another narrative, that of the person of the interlocutor</page><page sequence="12">128 I P. Steven Sangren him- or herself. Fascination with 'fate', in other words, is deeply intertwined with a cultural construction of self. I hasten to distinguish what I mean by "cultural construction of self," in this regard, from the notions familiar to us in earlier discussions of cultural construc- tion of personhood, epitomized by Geertz (1973c) in his famous essay, "Person, Time, and Conduct in Bali." Whereas the genre of ethno-psychology focuses on native or emic concepts of the person, what I have in mind is more a technology or process of production of a narrative, a form of self-consciousness, of person- hood. That is to say, the person is a cultural construction not so much insofar as he or she somehow embodies or believes in a culturally particular theory or ideology of personhood (e.g., Geertz's allegedly role-defined Balinese), as that he or she is a producer of a self-narrative, employing culturally available tech- niques. Among the techniques available to Chinese is fortune-telling. In this respect, fortune-telling operates much as do Chinese practices of wor- ship and testimony, another culturally salient arena of self-production (Sangren 1991, 2000a). Devout Chinese frequently engage ( qiashen ##) divinity by articulating their desires ( xuyuan ff 88). Most temples provide a variety of divinatory techniques (printed fortune slips, moon blocks, interpreters, etc.) to aid worshippers in these engagements. In effect, worshippers promise divinity to make repayments ( huanyuan Slit)- either literally, in the form of financial contributions to the temple, or by fulfilling a vow, for example, to undertake a pilgrimage- if their wishes are fulfilled. I have outlined elsewhere how worship and testimony constitute a narrative of self organized around divine interventions that punctuate key moments in religiously framed autobiographies (Sangren 1991). I would add here the obser- vation that the word/character yuan (II) means 'desire' or 'wish', indicating the centrality of desire in the rhetoric or discourse of self-construction. In other words, desire's constitutive role in the cultural/narrative production of the per- son or self outweighs any ethno-psychological or ethno-philosophical meaning of terms like 'self, 'person', or (in the present case) 'fate'. Ambivalence and (Back to) Fate Another of Freud's insights that has withstood critique is that children possess ambivalent feelings with respect to their parents: gratitude for the care and love bestowed upon them is mixed with resentment against the obstructions parents pose to desire's fulfillment. I suggest that ambivalence similarly models the existential paradox of fate and agency in the terms outlined above. I have in mind, loosely speaking, what Judith Butler (1997) terms 'subjection' in The Psychic Life of Power . Butler argues that coming into existence as a human being always and inevitably entails ambivalence. Drawing from Hegel and Lacan, Butler argues that desire comes into existence in the same process that also subjects us to (makes us effects or products of) forces that we do not, nor could we conceivably, wholly control. In other words, the ambivalence with respect to filial sentiments described by Freud would seem to be a paradigmatic</page><page sequence="13">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 129 example of a much more general, logically inescapable existential circum- stance-the human condition par excellence. In an earlier paper on the narrative role of fate in the Ming dynasty epic Fengshen Yanyi (U#SÉ[ü) (Investiture of the Gods), I noted, among other things, that although fate is represented repeatedly as beyond human control, it is employed as an instrument of the narrator's omnipotence (Sangren 2005). In other words, a document that obsessively affirms the omnipotence and transcen- dental status of fate itself embodies an extravagant and contradictory fantasy of authorial power- an imaginary world that submits wholly to the author's will. One might take this point in a deconstructive spirit as an instance of a text subverting its own premises, but I believe that this approach would be less illuminating than a more psychoanalytic accounting. In brief, Fengshen Yanyi does not so much incorporate its own deconstruction as recapitulate the nar- cissistic structure of ritual. Invoking an immutable transcendent power (in the text of Fengshen Yanyi , 'fate'; in the rhetoric of ritual, 'heaven' or 'the ances- tors') becomes the pivot or imaginary transcendental ground that facilitates assertion of the imaginer's omnipotence of thought by representing power in this alienated form.21 Ambivalence with respect to fate is thus built into the structure of Fengshen Yanyi- in the tension between its explicitly reiterated fatalism and its equally relentlessly exercised authorial omnipotence. And this is a theme, clearly, that transcends culture. In Melville's classic Moby Dicky for example, recall Ahab's hubris, his refusal to relinquish to fate, to nature, to Moby Dick. Ahab is hardly 'ambivalent', although the novel certainly is. As a protagonist, Ahab is tragic and arguably misguided, but not unsympathetic. The Omnipotence of Thoughts in Contemporary Idealist Philosophy At this juncture I should make explicit what might strike some as a somewhat forced comparison- the contemporary academic obsession with the subject, subjection (following Butler), agency, and kindred issues revolves around the same sorts of human concerns that manifest in the idiom of fate in Chinese rit- ual and cosmology. My purpose, again, is to encourage thinking about cultures and cultural constructions in terms that accommodate human commonalities as well as differences. In particular, I suggest that various forms of what I term 'idealist theory'- that is to say, approaches to social analysis that emphasize the productivity or primacy of language, cultural construction, nominalism, or (what I have glossed elsewhere as) 'discursive productivity' (Sangren 2004) - share with Chinese implicit theories of ritual efficacy a belief in (or a wish for) the omnipotence of thought. I have already mentioned interpretivist anthropology as exemplifying a tendency to approach culture as irreducible cause, but I suggest that many strains of contemporary critical theory- conveyed in the efficacy attributed to categories such as discourse or the symbolic or to more elusive formulations</page><page sequence="14">130 I P. Steven Sangren like performativity- similarly emphasize how language and/or thought real- ize, materialize, or bring the social into being. I hasten to emphasize that each of these framings contributes important insights to understanding culture and concede some overstatement with respect to my delineations. But I also insist that this idealist tendency is insufficiently dialectical with respect to resistances (hence, causalities) of extra-linguistic realities. Philosophical ideal- ism-no matter how apparently critical with respect to contemporary culture- seems unable to escape Freud's dictum to the effect that our enthrallment with the omnipotence of thoughts cannot be abandoned. Indeed, the reiterative re-emergence of idealist critiques of dialectical/materialist thinking, much as Butler (1997) describes with respect to subjection at the level of individual desire, seems linked to our unwillingness at some general or fundamental level to accept limitations- to accept the thought that we are not the sole authors of our own being.22 Idealism in contemporary theory is a discourse no less inhabited by (broadly speaking) desire-linked paradoxes than is the discourse of fate in Chinese culture. If this simile seems forced, note that Chinese ritual epistemology, as Adam Chau (2006: 235) puts it in his recent book on the renaissance of local religion, puts great faith in the efficacy of "doing things with words." Angela Zito (1997), too, shows how propriety {li /H) assumes the efficacy of symbolic 'text/performance' in Chinese thought, ranging from filial piety to imperial ritual.23 I have argued that prayer or seeking divine favor [qiushen ¿Ř#) can also be viewed as a form of, in this instance, self-production, mediated through the imagined agency of a god (Sangren 1991). In all of these instances we can discern what might be termed a faith in/fantasy of the performative/creative efficacy of thoughts/words- that is, of desires. Conclusions It is not surprising that Chinese are ambivalent about fate: Chinese elaborations upon fate register in culturally particular form what amounts to the human con- dition. In making this claim, I do not wish to suggest that cultural particularities are inconsequential to understanding fate. Rather, in the spirit of Weber's own efforts to elaborate through various ideal types the culturally various engage- ments with theodicy, I argue that the intellectual and institutional history of discourses of fate in China must figure importantly into our understanding. Yet, as such studies proliferate, it is important as well to make them accountable to the 'psychic unity of humankind'.</page><page sequence="15">Fate, Agency, and the Economy of Desire | 131 Acknowledgments In addition to the inspiration of those cited in this article, I would like to acknowl- edge the long-standing assistance and encouragement of colleagues at Taiwan's Institute of Ethnology (Academia Sinica), who have, over many years, repeatedly aided my research by offering affiliation with, interest in, and responses to my work. I also appreciate their practical help in establishing fieldwork connections. P. Steven Sangren is Professor of Anthropology and Asian Studies at Cornell Univer- sity. He received his BA from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University and (after three years' service in the United States Navy) his PhD from Stanford University. His work focuses on Chinese culture and society- especially, gender, religion, and mythic narrative. Drawing inspiration from Marxian and psychoana- lytic traditions, he aspires to understand how culture accommodates desire. His publications include History and Magical Power in a Chinese Community (19 87) and Chinese Sociologies: An Anthropological Account of the Role of Alienation in Social Reproduction (2000). His current project, tentatively titled "Filial Obsessions," is an analysis and critique of Chinese patriliny and gender ideology. Notes 1 . Indeed, among anthropologists there is persistent disagreement as to whether a category such as 'Chinese religion' usefully glosses any coherently discernible referent at all. See Freedman (1974); Watson (1976); Feuchtwang (1992); Feuchtwang, Fang-long, and TYemlett (2006); Wolf (1974a); Sangren (1984); and Weiler (1987). 2. Harrell's relevant research, like most of my own, was conducted mainly in the 1970s in northern Taiwan. 3. See also Harrell's (1985) related article on the Chinese work ethic, "Why Do the Chinese Work So Hard?" 4. In an as yet unpublished work, "Female Subjectivity in a Patrilineal Society," I dispute the notion, shared by Chinese exegetes and many Western academics, that Buddhist values conflict with more worldly or ancient Chinese ones. 5. Note that erasing memory but not responsibility places human agency in what amounts to a state of permanent ambiguity. 6. Less frequently noted than the contradiction between the notion of fate and free will or agency is what I suggest is a similar contradiction with respect to desire in Buddhist philosophy. On the one hand, Buddhism identifies desire as the fount of suffering and aspires to end suffering by extinguishing desire. On the other hand, the effort to extin- guish suffering/desire is itself desire understood in its most general or abstract form- a wish to a return to a fantasy of pre-Oedipal or pre-differentiated plenitude. 7. This question continues to vex economic historians. See, for example, Pomeranz's (2001) ambitious and provocative book, The Great Divergence : China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy. In terms of the longue durée, complex geo-political- cum-economic factors would seem more likely drivers of change than theological ones. Because Weber's thesis with respect to Calvinism's impact seems to have addressed</page><page sequence="16">132 I P. Steven Sangren proximate more than ultimate causalities, it is probably inappropriate to understand it as somehow undermining, for example, Marx's historical materialism. 8. Geertz's most influential essays are collected in The Interpretation of Cultures (1973b). 9. Segal (1999) argues persuasively that Geertz's approach, especially in contrasting expla- nation and interpretation, is in fact markedly more idealist than is Weber's. Moreover, "he [Geertz] advocates interpretation over explanation because he advocates focus on the particular over focus on the general" (ibid.: 64). 10. Note that fundamentally different theoretical assumptions are sometimes implied in sub- tle choices of terms. Here, for example, the passively constituted notion that personhood is a 'cultural construction' suggests that such an analysis should focus on concepts; to assert that persons are socially produced, even if passively constructed, implies a process in which social activity and not language or concept produces (i.e., acts as agent). 11. In a similar critical spirit, Quinn and Luttrell (2004: 494) lament the fact that in contem- porary anthropology "particularism has been raised to the level of a theoretical position in and of itself." 12. Elsewhere (Sangren 2000b), I have developed additional criticisms of interpretivist approaches. One of the most important is that focusing attention upon meaning or public symbol risks overlooking how ideology, misrecognition, and alienation manifest as symbol or meaning and thereby exercise productive (as well as constructive) power in processes of social reproduction, including expropriation. See also LaCapra's (1989) critique of Geertz's (1973a) polemic against analytical uses of ideology. 13. Festa's suggestion that gambling verges on a masculine form of divination, an activity he associates with women, may overstate somewhat the clarity of the distinction, but I agree with his point that the tendency echoes the relative resistance of men to rhetorical forms that explicitly deny them agency. Affinities between gambling and divination in China are widely noted both by anthropologists and Chinese themselves, becoming espe- cially explicit in myriad divinatory techniques employed to aid the gambler (or examina- tion taker, lover, etc.). In a very insightful paper, David Jordan (1982) draws attention to how knowledge of (im) probability informs many Chinese divinatory practices. Practices that include casting moon blocks and using bamboo divinatory sticks link this knowl- edge to the imputation of divine or transcendental intention. 14. The distinction between identity (i.e., what we are) and experience (i.e., what happens to us) is less stable or self-evident than this formulation suggests. What we do effects, of course, who we are or become. I have attempted elsewhere to delineate how processes of alienation, representation, and self-production, mediated by desire, link agency and experience in Chinese practices of worship and testimony (see Sangren 1991). 15. This doctrine, usually attributed to Johan Bastian and Franz Boas, holds that human beings everywhere are endowed with the same bio-psychological or cognitive potentials. I understand psychic unity defined by desire to control our own being to be consistent with Marx's assumptions regarding what he termed 'species being'. Marxian traditions, however, tend to emphasize control of nature through technology, downplaying the desire to control one's own being. 16. Note affinities here to Lacan's notion of the subject's 'entry into language', but for rea- sons too complex to elaborate here, I do not wish to suggest that the 'social' or 'cultural' is isomorphic with the Lacanian 'symbolic'. 17. Freud's (1920) often remarked description of his grandson's game of tossing out of sight and retrieving a spool connected to a string comes quickly to mind as a fantasy of mas- tery (among other things). 18. This is also an instance of 'alienation' in the classic Marxian sense, to the effect that the real producer or agent of ritual action is represented as a product of the imaginary that the agent's own action has produced. 19. The topic of patriliny is discussed at length in an unpublished manuscript tentatively titled "Filial Obsessions: Chinese Patriliny as Instituted Desire."</page><page sequence="17">Fate , Agency ; and t/ie Economy of Desire | 133 20. Žižek (1989), synthesizing Marx and Lacan, argues similarly for an understanding of social reality as constituted by ideology understood as fantasy. 21. My employments here of the terms 'transcendence' and 'alienation' draw inspiration from Terence Himer's (1977) very important but insufficiently appreciated theoretical analysis of ritual structure (see also Himer 1985, 1991). 22. Bourdieu attributes idealist resistance to practice theory to the narcissism of the idealist intelligentsia: "[I]t [the concept of habitus] collides head on with the illusion of (intel- lectual) mastery of oneself that is so deeply ingrained in intellectuals. To the three 'nar- cissistic wounds' evoked by Freud, those visited upon humanity by Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud himself, one should add that which sociology inflicts upon us, especially when it applies to 'creators'" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992: 131). 23. Zito makes intelligible the implicit epistemology of Chinese ritual practices. In my view, however, she may also accept too uncritically precisely the Chinese-cum-post-structural- ist faith in the efficacy of language/thoughts. References Bourdieu, Pierre, and Loïc J. D.
