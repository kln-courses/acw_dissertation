Some years ago, in MAy, 1918, 99, Dr. Haddon wrote a short article on the Kerewo tribe of the Gulf of Papua, and gave several sketches, including carved oval wooden slabs, some of which were called gopi and others kaiamunu or kaiamuru (Fig. 5), but there were no particulars as to their usage. Mr. W. W. Thorpe, of the Australian Museum, discussed in MAN, 1931, 60, some wooden slabs from the Purari district of the Gulf which he referred to as gopi, but which I pointed out could be only kwoi from the Purari, as gopi is the name of a dancing mask in that district.

[4]</page><page sequence="2">January, 1934.] MAN [No. 3 that seems to have arisen over the word gopi or gope led me to investigate the oval wooden slabs of Kerewo tribes and, as Dr. Haddon has mentioned, one finds two types of carved slabs in these village long houses (daimowa). The more important slabs are called gope or titiebiha, and a third named daimowa ebiha has become obsolete. The gope, to give them their everyday name, may be large or small. One I saw was 5 feet high, and another was only 3 feet. In width across the wide-t part the largest gope was 2 feet 3 inches. The kaiamunu, on the other hand, are never more than 4 feet in length and the width not more than 18 inches at its widest part. Unlike the gope, the kaiamunu has no hole in the upper part of the slab. Also, the titi or carving is distinguishable, the gope being carved in heavier relief, and, though also anthropomorphic in character, the greater part of the oval slab is occupied by a human face design, the rest of the body being crammed into the lower quarter. It is interesting to note the word ebiha in titi ebiha and daimowa ebiha. This is a secondary name for crocodile, though in the case of the gope it means 'guardian spirit.' Later on, in my work on the Turama tribes, I hope to shed fresh light on the connection between the guardian spirit and the crocodile. Both the gope and kaiamunu have individual names, but in the former case a new gope name cannot be applied to a gope carved for part of a clan (gu) which has separated from its parent village, the old name being applied to the new gope. Kaiamunu, on the other hand, have names which do not belong to the clan, and one finds new names springing up from time to time. I should say that the gope is the property of the clan as well as the individual, the kaiamunu of the individual alone. The gope would seem to be in many respects similar to the kwoi of the Purari, and the Kerewa seem to believe each has a spirit attached to it. The names of the gope may be mythological ancestral names, but many are undoubtedly place-names, though I have found that place-names are often the same as mythical ancestors. One of the uses of the gope is to guard the village from sickness, but its main object would seem to be its magico-religious value in warfare. It also takes a great ceremonial part in a dance called Gibumamu (Gibu mother-Gibu is the name of a place on the Turama, as well as a place in or near Dudi on the western bank of the Fly estuary). The gibumamu dance was brought by the Kerewo from the village of Keme, at the entrance to the Omati river. The Keme told me that they brought it with them from Wimari (which is the same place as the present village of Auti on Kiwai Island in the Fly estuary). The people joumeyed to Keme from Wimari and arrived there without any gope. Afterwards, the chief gope-Baiyau by name-travelled underground from Wimari and was followed by all the other gope. In Keme to-day the father of the gibumamu-gibumamu abera-is spoken of as Baiyau. The gibumamu gama (dance) was a preliminary ceremonial to a head-hunting raid, and is not danced at the present time. A dance called the obina takes its place as a ceremonial, and has been evolved from the older gibumamu, but a certain amount of the ceremony has been deleted to fit in with modern times. The following description of a gibumamu was given to me by the elders of Dopima village in the Kerewo district, and checked by other elders at Kerewo. It was taken down at the time in Motu, and translated at my leisure. Short notes were made here and there of the attitude of the raconteurs so that due emphasis could be given to parts where necessary. The Gibumamu-a Dance. When a large number of village pigs is available, the owners will talk with the headmen of the clan (gu paidubu), and these will arrange for a gibumamu dance to be held. After the matter has been discussed over and over again, a brother (muduabera) of the mother of each of the small children who are almost ready to be passed through the buguru initiation ceremony, meet and build a shelter of teased sago leaves (piruhuo) inside the daimowa or men's long ceremonial house. This room is called a huomoto, and is built on the main hall close to the tamu or salt-water end of the [ 5 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 3] MAN [January, 1934. long house. From the roof of the main house, and inside the huomoto shelter at the salt-water end, are hung the smaller gope or titi ebi7ari. When the huomoto is completed, the following morning at sunrise, the small boys and girls who are to be initiated are taken into this sacred room and sit in a row along the side fringe at the bush-end (nupsu) of the shelter. Facing them are the hanging gpe, while on the ground in front of them is a line of skulls taken down from the agibe shrine (a skull-rack holding skulls taken in warfare) These skuls are all freshly painted and decorated for the occasion. Having seated their charges, the mothers' brothers line up with drums between the skulls and the gope. Then begins the song of gbTumamu. Gibumamu Gido. Aihimu Gibu odoroi-odoroi Aihimu.

Each owner of a gope has his own special verse (line), and each verse is chanted for some time before the next verse is sung. The verses (lines) are sung in no special order. As each line is sung over and over again, it takes until about nine o'clock at night before the singers feel exhausted, then the mothers' brothers lead their charges to another closed-in portion of the long house. This temporary room, though in the centre of the long house (daimowa turi), is off the main hall in a line with the side cubicles. In this room all the initiates sleep, and it forms a seclusion room for them all the time they are not attending the ceremonies. The following morning, each muduabera visits his charge and rubs the initiate's body with a black paint made from umu leaves mixed with salt water. During the seclusion no clothing or ornaments are wom by these novices except that the young girls are dressed in a very short grass petticoat about 9 inches wide. This petticoat is worn hanging down, and is not caught up between the legs to form a perineal covering in the usual Kerewo manner. The blackness of the bodies of the initiates is accentuated when in the huomoto shelter, on account of the intense whiteness of the newly-painted gope. The foregoing ceremony takes place daily during the gibumamu celebrations, which may last from two to six months. Then, near the end of the seclusion period, food is collected for a big feast. Sago, sago-grubs, bananas, coconuts, sugar cane, fish, and a variety of edible foods collected from the forest and the sea are gathered and heaped up outside the long house. The huomoto shelter is taken down and during the same day the food is taken up into the long house and distributed. Dogs killed in the family houses are taken into the long ceremonial house after being cooked. Pigs are shot on the ground with arrows, and singed in the usual manner over a fire. In the olden days it was not necessary to kill the pig outright before it was singed. These pigs, after they are singed and dead, are carried into the daimowa and arranged in a line along the central part of the main hall, and opposite the pigs are placed mats for the initiates. [ 6 ]</page><page sequence="4">January, 1934.] MAN [No. 3 Now the children who are passing through the gibumamu are led into the main hall, and each is set upon the back of a pig, where the mudumaramu (the wives of the mothers' brothers) attend to the girls, and the mudtuabera tend the boys, as all initiates straddle the pig. Their hair is cut to fashion with a shell, and the lads have placed on them short penial aprons of hammered bark. Then their bodies are ornamented with strings of cowries, crescent pearl-shells, and white bidibidi shell-discs. Hornbill and cassowary feathers are placed in the hair, and conus shells on the arms. Numerous plaited fibre armbands decorated with cowrie shells also adorn the arms and legs. The girl initiate is dressed in a red pubic covering whioh is used in place of the short petticoat. This covering is a long fringe of teased sago leaf dyed red, and it is stuck into the front part of the waistbelt, drawn up in between the legs and fastened in the belt at the back. Her ornaments are similar to those of a boy, but before they are put on she receives a slashing of the skin between the breasts with a clam shell. These cuts will later show up as a cicatrice. As soon as this part of the ceremony is concluded, the pigs are taken away and cut up and distributed. The children would seem now to have risen a further stage in the social scale, and they are seated on the mats with their guardians, who have been given presents by the mothers and fathers of the initiates. About five o'clock each evening, the gope are brought into the main hall, the larger and more important ones having an evening to themselves. The smaller and therefore not so important may come in two or three at a time. As each gope is brought in, the appropriate verse of the gido is sung over and over again, and later on the gope is placed against the inside wall of the salt water end so that it faces down the main hall. When all the gope are in position, which may take five or more days according to the number, the muduabera takes the gope belonging to him and holds it by the middle of each side, his hands being in line with his shoulders. The young children cling to their guardian by means of a string attached to a hole in the side of the gope. Up and down the main hall of long house they dance throughout the day, and in the evening descend to the ground, and dance there until the sun has set, when they all return to the long house with the gope and a feast commences. About 7 p.m. or a little later, when the feasting is finished, and it is as dark as Erebus in the long house, each muduabera with his charge lines up along the side wall of the main hall with the gope in front of him and the initiate at his side. No word is spoken by anyone. No sound is heard in the women's houses. An awful silence broods over the whole village. The gope with its tiny torch burning in an aperture in the upper part of the slab shows up weirdly in its whiteness. Silent as the grave, and motionless as the sacred slabs they hold, stands the row of figures. Into this darkness creep the men of the village and visitors from other parts. By and by, the great long hall is full of silent, motionless men holding drums. Perhaps 200 to 300 fighting men may be assembled. Suddenly, the tense silence of an hour is broken by a ghostly swish-swish. It is the village headman entering, accompanied by his wife. As he creeps in, he slaps his thigh with a torch of dried coconut leaves. Up and down the long house travels this unearthly sound, pausing only when the man reaches the leader of the ceremony. Then, like a bolt from the blue, the blackness is broken by an unexpected blaze of light from a torch lit at some smouldering fire. The torchbearer yells, and hundreds of voices in the daimowa break into bloodcurdling cries-at first high-pitched i..i..i, and then a lower a..a..a. Hundreds of drums are beaten rapidly, and the dancers whirl into lines. All the fighting men now have torches, and the long house is a blaze of light from the hundred or so flashing torchllghts. The mothers' brothers with their little charges, all agape, hold the gope up among the dancers. The women crowd in from the many side openings and fill up the open spaces at the sides of the cubicles. They sit, and watch the dancers, and pass remarks of admiration or gossip as they pass. The singing gets wilder and wilder; the drums keep up their monotonous reiteration. The whole daimowa works itself up to a frenzy, and the dance becomes an orgy in which dancers and onlookers wallow in sexual excess. None sleep-except the small children, tired out with their amazing experiences; and then, [ 7 ]</page><page sequence="5">Nos. 3-4] MAN [January, 1934. when day breaks, the dancers descend to the ground, carrying drums or gope. As they fall into line, the headman will call out and ask where they will go and fight. As various villages are named, the gope are turned to face in the direction of that village. Should the gope move, while facing a certain direction, it is decided to raid a village in that direction. During this procedure, the drums are being held in the hand, the drumhead a little below the shoulder, and, when a decision is reached, the drums are struck quickly, several times, and the gope placed face downward on the ground. There they are left all day, and after dark are taken to the long house, and put back in their everyday position along the walls of the cubicles at the side entranceways. These walls form the ends of the clan sections of the long house. The day following this final ceremony, all the fighting men set off in their great war canoes to raid the village selected by the gope, who have already gone ahead in spirit form to overcome the enemy's spirits, and make them weak and unable to withstand the onslaught of the raiders. Translation of the Gibumamu Gido. Line 1. Aihimnu a legendary canoe whose mythical abode is the southern end of Turibomu (Umaidai) Island in the Turama river. The canoe has the power of changing itself into a crocodile. Odoroi, a poetical form referring to the canoe ' going up ' the river. Gibu, a place-name occurring on the western bank of the Fly and Turama estuaries. 2. Boge (poetical form Bugi) and Wimari are names of gope. Ura, the other side of the river, i.e., referring to the eastem side as compared with the western bank. 3. The general translation is that Boge goes inside the ground. 4. Mobe is a gope name and the reference is to the gope inside the ground getting up as it wants to go and kill the enemy. 5. Wino and Wabea are gope names. Totoi ididi, apparently these gope make a shelter similar to a bush pig's shelter of leaves. Old men unable to give reference or legend concerning same. 6. Busere, a girl. Wabeairo is a poetical form of abea, the strainer used by a girl when making sago flour. 7. Aribu, a gope name. Iriru is a feather decoration which bobs about in the gope when it is being carried. 8. One translator said that the agibe skull shrine looks on at the feather bobbing about. 9. Another untranslatable line with references to line 5. 10. Recalls the final part of the gibumamu when the gope lie face downwards anct- dig into the ground. Waumie, poetical form of aumi and is a reminder that if people's mouths are shut (i.e., they don't call out the name of the gope) the gope will get angry. 11. Referring to a gope called koromookoromo, which goes into the ground. 12, 13 and 14. Similar references as in No. 11. 15. Mobi, a gope name. Banio, the beautiful red sunset. 16, 17 and 18.
