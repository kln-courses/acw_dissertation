<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism . Edited by Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman. New York: Columbia UP, 2005. 230 pp. Cloth $49.50. Thinking with Animals explores how humans use animal represen- tations to understand ourselves. The deliberate ambiguity of the title characterizes the collection's eclecticism; although editors Lorraine</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews T71 Daston and Gregg Mitman are both historians of science, the contribut- ing authors look at animals from a variety of perspectives. The three essays in part one of the book examine historical represen- tations of animals. Wendy Doniger explores the interrelation of sexu- ality and language in ancient India by analyzing anthropomorphism and zoomorphism in early Sanskrit texts. Next, Daston looks at what it means to project human characteristics onto celestial beings as well as onto earthly animals. In a comparative study of works by John Milton and Franz Kafka, Daston also offers insight into "the most deeply rooted assumptions concerning the human mind" (40). Finally, Paul S. White examines Victorian debates about animal experimentation, which shaped the tone and terms used in animal rights arguments today. In part two, Elliott Sober looks at the historical origins of anthro- pomorphism and its opposite, anthropodenial, and Sandra D. Mitchell argues that anthropomorphism can play a useful role in comparative ethology if it is used carefully. Part three shifts to the opposite kind of human-animal interaction in James A. Serpell's study of people and pets. Serpell, a professor of Humane Ethics and Animal Welfare, explains that anthropomorphism shapes human-pet relationships in ways both beneficial and harmful to animals. Charyce Kramer analyzes another kind of emotional manipulation, that of some animal photog- raphy which, by using animal pictures to express and evoke human emotions, reduces each animal to a photographic "emoticon" (145). Part four continues the book's examination of photography, as Mit- man offers an historical overview of the conflict between two competing groups of scientists: one group takes a statistical approach, while the other studies individuals and groups within the overall population. Mitman focuses on both groups' use of photography as a political and rhetorical tool to further their differing methodologies. Finally, Sarita Siegel writes of deliberately using anthropomorphism in her documen- tary film about orangutans, The Disenchanted Forest , explaining how anthropomorphism helps her non-scientific audience understand the orangutans being studied. Each essay in Thinking With Animals offers a unique contribution to the study of animal representations. A scholar seeking discussion of anthropomorphism in one particular area, genre, or medium may find useful only one or two essays in this eclectic book. However, for scholarsin- terested in a multi-disciplinary exploration of animal representations in literature, science, and visual media, Thinking With Animals offers an array of useful and insightful analyses.
