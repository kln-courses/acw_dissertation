<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greek Religion and Philosophy in the Sisyphus Fragment CHARLES H. KAHN The Sisyphus fragment (DK 88B.25) consists of 42 iambic trimeters cited by Sextus Empiricus as an expression of the atheistic views of the tyrant Critias.' Sextus does not mention the name Sisyphus, but another citation (in the doxography known as Aetius) tells us that the speech was deliv- ered by Sisyphus in a play by Euripides. I translate the text as given by Snell.2 There was a time when the life of human beings was disordered and beastly, and life was ruled by force, when there was no reward for the virtuous nor any punishment for the wicked. And then I think that humans decided to establish laws to punish [wrongdoers] so that justice might rule and be master over crime and violence (hybris). And they punished anyone who did wrong. Then, since the laws held public deeds in check and prevented men from open acts of violence, but they acted secretly, then it was, I believe, that a shrewd and clever-minded man invented for mortals a fear of the gods, so that there might be a deterrent for the wicked, even if they act or say or think anything in secret. Hence from this source the divine was introduced [with the claim] that there is a deity who enjoys imperishable life, hearing and seeing with his mind, his thought and attention on all things, his nature so divine that he will hear whatever is said among mortals and be able to see whatever is done.

KAHN If ever you plot some evil deed in silence, even this will not escape the gods. For they have knowledge. It was such stories that he told when he introduced this most delightful teaching and hid the truth with a false tale. He said the gods dwell there and placed them where they might make the greatest impression upon human beings, there where he knew that fears come to mortals and benefits also [to relieve] the miseries of life, from the vault on high, where they beheld the shafts of lightning and fearful blows of thunder and star-filled gleam of heaven, the beautiful design of Time the clever builder, parade-ground for the brilliant mass of the sun and source of rainfall moistening the earth below. Such were the fears with which he surrounded humans and by which this clever man established the deity in the proper place, with a handsome story, and extinguished lawlessness by means of laws. It was thus, I think, that someone first persuaded mortals to believe that there is a race of gods. I propose to discuss this text as a remarkable document for the inter- action between reason and religion in the fifth century. It is the best- preserved example of fifth-century accounts of the origin of religion, and it is the most outspoken example of fifth-century atheism.3 My aim here will be to situate this text within the larger framework of the interaction between religion and early Greek natural philosophy. Sisyphus' specula- tion concerning the origin of belief in the gods has familiar parallels in the theories of Democritus and Prodicus, theories which belong to the tra- dition of Kulturenstehungslehre or accounts of the rise of human civili- zation. And these accounts in turn, like the later prehistories in Lucretius and Diodorus, have their place within a tradition of explaining the origin of mankind and the origin of the world - a tradition that began in fifth century Miletus. These accounts of human prehistory were first formulated within a speculative narrative that began with cosmogony and ended with the development of human beings and human life in society. We know that the biological origin of human beings was already a topic in the ear- 3 The atheism is explicit in verse 26 tED?e;i waX(Wa; rv X#OEtav X6yw, implicit in the closing lines oizro 8E ip&amp;nov o'lojai icrioai nva/OvTIToi; voAi'CEyv &amp;U6POvMv ?lVat YEVO;.</page><page sequence="3">THE SISYPHUS FRAGMENT 249 liest version of such doctrines, in the theory of Anaximander. We will need to ask when Ionian philosophers began to speculate on the social origins of mankind and the prehistory of religion. My first question, then, concerns the background of the Sisyphus text in Ionian natural philosophy. A second question concerns the rise of the- oretical atheism. And a third question involves the atmosphere of moral cynicism of which our text is such a conspicuous specimen. These three issues - the origin of culture, the denial of the reality of the gods, and a cynical view of morality - all come together in the Sisyphus fragment, but they represent three distinct historical developments. I shall begin with the larger question of the impact of the new natural philosophy upon Greek conceptions of divinity. But first we must take account of the important new perspective on our fragment introduced by Albrecht Dihle's paper of 1977.4 This text was traditionally printed as a fragment of Critias, in the stand- ard editions by Diels, Nauck and Snell. (They were all following the refer- ence in Sextus, reinforced by a hypothesis of Wilamowitz.) Dihle showed that this attribution was almost certainly a mistake, since parts of the text are assigned to Euripides by several authors. The quotation must belong to the satyr play Sisyphus, which is known to have been produced by Euripides in 415 B.C., together with the trilogy consisting of Alexander, Palamedes and The Trojan Women. I will not repeat Dihle's arguments here, because I believe his conclusion has been widely and rightly ac- cepted.5 I will take it for granted, then, that the fragment belongs to Euripides and not to Critias. The attribution to Euripides changes more than the author's name. When these verses were read as the work of the sinister tyrant, it was tempting to take them as reflecting the amoral views of their author.6 We A. Dihle, "Das Satyrspiel 'Sisyphos'," Hermes 105 (1977) 28-42. So Ruth Scodel, The Trojan Trilogy of Euripides, Hypomnemata 60 (Gottingen, 1980), 124ff.; Martin Ostwald, From Popular Sovereignty to the Sovereignty of Law, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1986), p. 281. As Scodel observes (p. 280), one of the best reasons for assigning the text to Euripides is "its direct relevance to the issues raised in the tragic dramas of 415," namely, issues of divine justice and the nature of the gods. Further support for Dihle's attribution is provided by Harvey Yunis in ZPE 75 (1988), 39-46, who argues plausibly that the immediate context for this speech is to be found in a Euripides fragment preserved in P. Oxy. 1176. 6 So, e.g., Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3 (Cambridge, 1969) p. 243. Of course if the words were spoken by a stage character in a play by Critias,</page><page sequence="4">250 CHARLES H. KAHN could then cite Critias' theory of religion as a more cynical alternative to those of Prodicus and Democritus. Once we recognize Euripides as the author, however, the documentary status of the text becomes rather dif- ferent. There is no reason whatsoever to ascribe this view of religion to Euripides himself. In Euripides' plays we can find all manner of religious sentiment and belief, generally adapted to the character or circumstances of the speaker. As Dihle has observed, for the poet to put these views into the mouth of the arch-trickster Sisyphus is not exactly to provide a per- sonal endorsement. We know, after all, how the gods will deal with Sisyphus. Transferring the fragment from Critias to Euripides thus renders the historical status of our text more problematic: instead of an autonomous theory, we have the speech of a stage persona. But whose theory is being utilized here? And how is this theatrical statement related to philosophi- cal speculation concerning the gods? We must return to these questions. But first we take a look at the larger background of relations between phi- losophy and religion. I From the beginning, the new world view introduced by Milesian cosmol- ogy in the sixth century was inevitably hostile to the anthropomorphic conception of the gods, familiar from Homer and Hesiod. This hostility is first documented in Xenophanes' and Heraclitus' attacks on the poets, and most fully displayed in Aristophanes' Clouds, where Socrates offers natu- ralistic explanations of rain and thunderbolt as the justification for not believing in Zeus. On the other hand, there is nothing to suggest that Ionian philosophy was hostile to the category of the divine as such. On the contrary, as Jaeger and others have emphasized, the Presocratic phi- losophers introduced a new and broader conception of deity. Thales is supposed to have said "all things are full of the gods," just as, at a later date, the Hippocratic author of On the Sacred Disease will describe all the powers of nature as divine (theia).' Anaximander is reported to have they need not represent Critias' own view (as Sextus assumes that they do). But the temptation was there, and many (including myself) have yielded to it in the past. 7 On the Sacred Disease 18.1-2, Grensemann, p. 88: avrii 6.E i'l voioo; i1 ipiz lcaXEole'vTl a&amp;n6o Tv aiutdv xpoatiwv yivexat Kcat ai kotxai, a&amp;1co Tdv xpoat6v)v scai nt6OvMtV Kat Wi)EOq KcaLt i'1ioV KOWI 7vCUl4L 0 Ev ?esaXXogE'vov Te KcaL OV6?XtE &amp;Tpe5o6v,tov.

The notion of divin- ity would in any case be suggested by Anaximander's choice of the term "boundless," the Homeric epithet for Earth and Sea. The doxography for Anaximenes similarly lists "gods and things divine (theia)" among the cosmic products emerging from the Boundless Air (DK 13A 7.1). In the absence of the original texts, we cannot be sure which terms were actually used by the Milesians, much less what conceptual weight they were intended to bear. But it is reasonable to suppose that the language of divinity was used to express a sense of awe and respect, even rever- ence, before the supreme cosmic powers of the newly conceived order of nature. A century later, the conservative Ionian cosmologist Diogenes of Apollonia is probably faithful to the spirit of sixth-century Miletus when he described his world-ordering principle of intelligent Air as a god (theos, B 5). The fragments of Diogenes give us our most explicit documentation for this conception of cosmic deity within fifth-century natural philosophy, but there is no reason to suppose that Diogenes is either original or eccentric in this regard. His doctrine of cosmic Air is clearly derived from Anaxim- enes, just as his notion that things could not be so well arranged without the organizing work of intelligence (noesis) reflects the views of Anaxagoras, or even of Xenophanes. The notion that cosmic order depends upon a principle capable of ruling or "steering" all things goes back at least to Heraclitus, and probably to Anaximander (A 15). So when a character in Euripides or Aristophanes prays to "immeasurable Air, who holds the earth aloft in its embrace," what we hear is an echo not of Diogenes spe- cifically but of the whole cosmological tradition that begins in Miletus.8 Did these Ionian naturalists believe in the gods? The answer is obvi- ously: yes and no. It all depends upon how one conceives a "god." And it is well to remind ourselves of the radical difference between the Greek 8 The direct antecedent for Aristophanes' parody is probably Euripides fr. 941N, where the aither that holds the earth in its moist embrace is obviously air, not the upper sky. Similarly in Aeschylus fr. 70, where aither is distinguished from ouranos, it must refer to the atmosphere. In both texts aither is called Zeus. The doctrine that the earth is supported by air goes back to Anaximenes, and there is no reason to con- nect it specifically with Diogenes rather than with Anaxagoras or with any Ionian cos- mologist. The influence of Diogenes on Athenian thought of the fifth century seems to be a figment of modern scholarship without basis in the texts. The lucky preserva- tion of abundant quotations from Diogenes in Simplicius does not alter the fact that his cosmological thought is banal and traditional.</page><page sequence="6">252 CHARLES H. KAHN term theos and the word for god in any modern tongue. Unlike "God" in the question "does God exist?" theos is not a proper name but a sortal: it designates not an individual but a kind of thing. There is no shadow of monotheism over the conception of deity in pre-Biblical thought. The expression ho theos, "the god," means whatever divinity happens to be relevant in the context. There is never a suggestion that there is only one of this kind, even if there is only one of real philosophical interest. The attitude of the philosophers is best described as "henotheism": only one god worth mentioning, but without any claims to a monopoly position. Aristotle's theology is typical of the genre: only one Prime Mover, but a large and uncertain number of Unmoved Movers, depending upon the astro- nomical model. In principle, the Milesian conceptions of divinity would not have been very different. The primary case of theos or theion is the highest power that rules or guides the world-order. But the same divine category would include a large number of independent cosmic powers. For the Milesians, then, we may conjecture a theological position of the sort that we find documented in the case of the first two lonians for whom there are substantial remains: Xenophanes and Heraclitus. While fiercely attacking the anthropomorphic gods of the poetic tradition, Xenophanes is eager to proclaim his own, more cosmically oriented doctrine of "the one god, greatest among gods and humans," who is "unlike mortals in form and even in thought."9 Similarly for Heraclitus: the wise principle of cos- mic order (hen to sophon) is both "unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus" (B.32). Heraclitus thus pointedly expresses both the sharp refusal of the new philosophy to accept the traditional, poetic pic- ture of the gods (that is why "unwilling" comes first), and at the same time its willingness to make free use of theological concepts in its descrip- tion of the fundamental realities. So the Heraclitean principle of conflict, Polemos, is, like Zeus, "father of all and king of all" (B 53). And the prin- ciple that steers all thing is called keraunos, the thunderbolt of Zeus (B.64). But that is not all. For Heraclitus deity takes many forms: "the god (ho theos) is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, hunger and satiety" (B.67). Thus for Xenophanes and Heraclitus, as for Diogenes and the Hippo- cratic author (and presumably for the Milesians as well), the category of 9 It should be clear from Xenophanes B.23 and from every other reference in the fragments that his "one greatest god" is only one theos among many. The plural theoi appears not only in the "polar expression" of fr. 23 ("greatest among gods and humans") but in B.1, 24, B.18, and above all in B.34 ("no one knows for sure about the gods").</page><page sequence="7">THE SISYPHUS FRAGMENT 253 the divine is intact, although its occupants have changed completely. What we have here is the invention of natural theology, taking the form of hier- archical pantheism, a flexible, polytheistic version of Spinoza's deus sive natura. Aristophanes has faithfully caricatured this theological situation when he has Socrates deny the existence of Zeus (as conventionally under- stood by Strepsiades) but makes Socrates pray to "lord Air immeasur- able, who holds the earth aloft," while at the same time introducing the Clouds as "our only gods - the rest is nonsense" (v. 365). So in another context Socrates will insist that Strepsiades must worship "no gods except ours: Chaos here, the Clouds and the Tongue" (vv. 423f.). As parodied in Aristophanes, taken seriously in Euripides, the natu- ralistic world view is thus fully compatible with theological modes of discourse. And if this holds true for the Ionian tradition, the compatibil- ity between theology and natural philosophy is even more striking in a western poet-philosopher like Empedocles. His god is a religious ver- sion of Anaxagorean nous: "a holy mind ((pp1v iepi) flitting through the whole kosmos with its rapid thoughts" (B.134). And, like a true polytheist, Empedocles also assigns divine status to his four elements and his two cosmic principles, Love and Strife. Writing in hexameter verse, Emped- ocles finds it natural to call these principles by divine names. But the par- allels in Heraclitus, Diogenes and the Hippocratic author, as well as in the doxography for the Milesians, show that this attitude is not limited to philosophical poets. II The situation had, however, already begun to change with Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras' cosmic nous sounds godlike enough, since it is said to be boundless, sovereign, omniscient, all-ruling, the finest and purest of things. But nous is deliberately not said to be god. (B.12) I suggest that Anax- agoras' more reserved attitude to the language of theology can be seen as parallel to the first known expression of agnosticism by Anaxagoras' most eminent contemporary, Protagoras: "Concerning the gods, I am unable to know either that they exist or that they do not exist or what they are like in form" (B.4). And here we must take due notice of the fact that this last clause ("what they are like in form") extends philosophical scepticism beyond the boundaries of traditional, anthropomorphic religion to the cate- gory of the divine as such.'0 Protagorean doubts thus undermine not only 10 The authenticity of this clause has been doubted, but on insufficient grounds.</page><page sequence="8">254 CHARLES H. KAHN Homer's account of Zeus but also Xenophanes' claims concerning his "greatest god," and, by implication, any philosophical use of the term theos in which the concept of deity is taken to be more than a stylistic flourish. I do not mean to suggest that Anaxagoras has been infected by Protago- rean scepticism, but rather that both thinkers represent a new, more criti- cal attitude in regard to natural theology and the discourse of deity, an attitude that emerges in the middle of the fifth century, and that is repre- sented in the next generation by Democritus (and perhaps already by Leucippus). For it is probably correct to think of atomism as the first truly godless world view in the Greek philosophical tradition. Unlike the Ionian cosmologies based upon the vital principle of Air or Breath, a world composed of atoms and the void really leaves no place for cosmic divinity, not even for a quasi-divine principle like Anaxagorean nous. Since Democritus has found an ingenious epistemic justification for human conceptions of the gods - the divine eidola -, his system is not strictly atheos. But his world order is certainly not governed by any principle of cosmic rationality of the sort that we can trace from Xenophanes to Diogenes. In atomism the Ionian Enlightenment has generated a world view that rejects not only the old anthropomorphic conception of the gods but also the new notions of cosmic deity. At this point we may leave the fifth century for a moment and look ahead to Plato's reaction in the Laws. For it is precisely this atomist or post- Anaxagorean version of natural philosophy that Plato has in view in his attack on atheistic cosmology in Laws 10. For it was not Anaxagoras but Democritus who taught that the world order was produced "by nature and by chance, not by art" (889Bff.). Plato's reference to techne in this context underscores the contrast between Anaxagorean nous and the ananke of the atomists. It is the Ionian tradition as interpreted by Democritus that Plato takes as his target, and with this he connects the doctrine that the gods exist not by nature but by convention (nomoi): different gods in dif- ferent societies "according to the legislation which they have agreed upon together" (889E). Plato also recognizes the alarming moral implications of these doctrines in Protagorean relativism and in the kind of ruthless rule of force that Callicles in the Gorgias asserts as "natural morality" (xa caXa p&amp;OE, Laws 10,889e-890a). We are concerned here not with Plato's fourth-century counterattack but with the fifth-century development to which he is reacting, a development that begins with Protagoras' agnosticism and Anaxagoras' reluctance to</page><page sequence="9">THE SISYPHUS FRAGMENT 255 designate nous as theos. What has happened to provoke this change in the middle of the fifth century? Modern scholars often seem to take for granted that atheism is the inevitable consequence of a rational world view. But that was not the opinion of Plato, Aristotle or the Stoics. Strictly speaking, it was not even the opinion of the Epicureans. And if we set aside the Epicureans and the Sceptics, some form of natural theology seems to have prevailed in every system of ancient thought, until it was finally replaced by supernatural theology in the Christian period. As his- torians we must ask: what happened in the middle of the fifth century B.C. to call into question the original alliance between a naturalistic world view and cosmic theology - an alliance that had then to be restored by Plato in the Timaeus and the Laws? We have this relatively brief "win- dow" of philosophical atheism and agnosticism in the late fifth century, a window that was decisively closed by Plato. (Of course atheism and agnosticism did not disappear after Plato, but the only school that pro- vided philosophical cover for such attitudes was Scepticism, and there, strictly speaking, only for agnosticism.) My suggestion is that this new, more critical attitude towards theology was triggered by an innovation that we cannot securely date but that is likely to have begun no later than the time of Anaxagoras. This is the rise of speculation concerning the origins of religious belief. And that brings us back to the Sisyphus fragment. Ill Our text of 415 B.C. opens with the description of a primitive State of Nature, "when the life of human beings was disordered and bestial, sub- ject to force," when there was no reward for the good nor punishment for evil. The Euripidean Sisyphus can clearly take for granted this primitive stage of human life, as the basis for his own more original suggestion as to the origin of religion. The existence of an earlier fifth-century text, now lost, on the State of Nature is confirmed by many literary allusions to an initial condition in which human beings lived like the animals, scattered apart from one another, without any social organization. The best known example is of course a fourth-century text, in the allegory Plato assigns to Protagoras in the dialogue named after him. And there are many echoes in later authors such as Diodorus Siculus. The fullest and (for Rousseau and modern thinkers) most influential version of this story of mankind's beginnings is to be found in Lucretius Book V.</page><page sequence="10">256 CHARLES H. KAHN The account of human prehistory given by Lucretius probably de- rives from Democritus, via Epicurus." But how original was Democritus? We know that the tradition was older. We have several accounts in fifth- centuly tragedy, beginning with the passage in which Prometheus recounts his gift of the arts to mankind. Before that time, says Prometheus, human beings lived a life of confusion: "without houses or carpentry they lived in caves, like ants."'2 In Sophocles' Antigone the chorus praises mankind for possession of the arts, but also for "speech and wind-swift thought and the temper to dwell in cities (&amp;arxvogoi 6pyai)" (354-6). The skill of political life is thus added to the arts of Prometheus, exactly as in Plato's Protagoras. Some scholars have assumed that the lost text which lies behind these tragic passages was a work of Protagoras, On the condition of things in the beginning, of which only the title survives, but whose contents are assumed to be preserved in Plato's allegory.'3 This assumption has been so frequently made that its validity may seem obvious. I believe, however, that the hypothesis of Protagorean authorship for the unknown archetype on human prehistory is in fact quite implausible. It takes no account of the power and freedom of Plato's literary imagination in what is essen- tially a work of fiction. (Does anyone suppose that Aristophanes' speech in the Symposium is derived from a lost play of Aristophanes?) The form of Plato's allegory is obviously inspired by the Aeschylean Prometheus; the content must exploit the same kind of source that Sophocles is using in the Antigone. But if we can judge by the later versions in Diodorus and Lucretius, the pre-Sophoclean archetype should be a text in natural phi- losophy, a text that begins with a cosmogony and proceeds to explain the origin of animal life, including the origins of human beings. After describ- ing the primitive condition of mankind, the narrative will then recount the stages (mastery of fire, the arts, language, society and government) by I See T. Cole, Democritus and the Sources of Greek Anthropology (Western Reserve University, 1967). Not all of the details of Cole's reconstruction are con- vincing, but the central line of descent from Democritus to Lucretius seems to me established. 12 P.V. 449-453 Wov gaKcpov piov/Equpov Et" iravtva KOUYE iXVOVOei;/6OgOU; ipooCEiXov; toav, ov 41Xoxpko aV/KcaTo)piXes 6' 'vatov &amp;aSa' &amp;n1aipol/wpnLT1KCs avxp(V)v eV gvXoi; &amp;viiX(ot;.

Nothing we know about Protag- oras would lead us to believe that he had indulged in dogmatic specula- tion of this kind. All the probabilities point to someone squarely in the tradition of Ionian natural philosophy - someone like Anaxagoras. As we know, the primitive condition of human beings, together with the origin of animal life, was included in the original Milesian account of how the world order came into existence.'4 Furthermore, when Xenoph- anes declares that "by no means did the gods reveal all things to mortals from the beginning, but by seeking they discovered what is better in the course of time" (B 18), we must assume that he is rejecting some mythi- cal account of the origin of the arts (as gifts of Prometheus, for example), in favor of a more naturalistic version such as we find in Diodorus and Lucretius. And several texts of Anaxagoras indicate that this sort of expla- nation of the rise of civilization, as relying upon human experience and ingenuity, was well advanced by the middle of the fifth century.5 Like the chorus in Antigone and like Protagoras in Plato's dialogue, Anaxagoras refers specifically to the human achievement of living in cities (B.4). More on this subject, including what is probably the earliest known reference to a social contract, is preserved in the doxography for Anaxagoras' pupil Archelaus. Following a full cosmogony in the Milesian- Ionian style, Archelaus explained how human beings were formed, like the other animals, from a mixture of hot and cold in the moist but drying earth, which nourished these primitive creatures with a milk-like slime (iXi, DK 60A.1, 17 and A.4, 5). Humans were then separated off from the other animals, and (as the doxography reports in its condensed style) they established "rulers and laws and arts and cities" (A.4, 6). Archelaus is also reported to have declared that "what is just and shameful exists not by nature but by convention (vo6gy, A.1, 16)." Morality and govern- ment are thus established by a movement from Nature to contract or Convention, from physis to nomos. We cannot infer from the accidents of doxographic survival that the theory of Archelaus displayed significant originality. What this highly compressed report does show is that thinkers in the circle of Anaxagoras were familiar with a naturalistic theory of human culture, including an account of political society and norms (nomoi). It is in this circle that '4 See Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology (New York, 1960/1ndiana- polis, 1994), pp. 68-71, 110-113. 1 Anaxagoras A.102, B.4, B.21b.</page><page sequence="12">258 CHARLES H. KAHN I would locate the archetype for our passages in Aeschylus,'6 Sophocles and Plato. It is from the same Ionian tradition, represented in Athens by Anaxagoras, that Democritus will be drawing in his more elaborate account of human prehistory, the Epicurean derivative of which is pre- served in Lucretius. In my view, it is a mistake to attempt to attach an individual name to the missing archetype, the source for these various accounts of human pre- history. And that is not only because so much early documentation is lost. We need to recognize that this tradition in cosmogony and prehistory is essentially conservative. Ancient natural philosophers copied from their predecessors just as modem textbooks do, adding a new feature here and there, or choosing among traditional variants. For example, the descrip- tion of human life as "disordered and bestial (a`,aK-oq ... 'cat Np168%)," which occurs in our Sisyphus fragment, is echoed in several fifth- and fourth-century texts and is repeated word for word in the prehistory of Diodorus Siculus some 400 years later. Similarly, Diodorus' account of the first animals, generated from the moist but heated earth, bears an uncanny resemblance to the origin of living thinks reported for Anaximander and Archelaus."7 In a tradition so conservative, the notion of archetype must be treated with caution. In my view, the true source for the prehistory in Diodorus and Lucretius is not an individual thinker but rather the entire tradition of natural philosophy from Anaximander to Democritus. In attempting to date innovations within this tradition, the best we can hope for is a terminus ante quem. Thus the date of the Antigone, c. 440 B.C., gives us such a lower limit for a theory of the origin of human speech and urban society, of the sort that is reported for Archelaus. When did a naturalistic account of religion enter this narrative of hu- man origins? In the Aeschylean version religion is represented among the gifts of Prometheus by the arts of divination and sacrifice (P.V. 484-97). Empedocles provided a semi-mythical account of prehistoric meatless sacrifice in his Katharmoi (B.128). So some speculation on the prehistory of religious cult is well attested for the middle of the fifth century, before 16 I do not mean to beg the question of authenticity for the Prometheus. But if the play is by Aeschylus, our archetype must be dated before 456 B.C. and thus no later than Anaxagoras. I7 Diodorus 1.7.3-8.1 = DK 68B.5,1.

On the other hand, if either Anaxagoras or Archelaus had a theory of the origin of religious belief, we know nothing of it. Nevertheless, the scepticism expressed by Protagoras suggests that this is the moment, around 450 B.C., when such speculation would natu- rally take shape. And perhaps it is no accident that our doxography con- tains no trace of what must have been the earliest versions. In the absence of documentation one can only guess. My conjecture is that the relevant speculation began no later than Anaxagoras, but that it was not neces- sarily part of the written account. Perhaps it was only a later thinker such as Democritus who first included the origin of belief in the gods in an explicit, written narrative of the rise of human culture, roughly in the form in which we find it later in Lucretius (V.1 161-93). Democritus would then be our source for the Sisyphus speculation, perhaps via Prodicus. After all, Democritus did not live in Athens, and (unlike Anaxagoras) he pre- sumably did not have to fear the prospect of a trial for impiety. IV The Sisyphus fragment happens to be the earliest surviving text to de- scribe the transition from a natural "beastly" state to life in human society. Now in this text the invention of the gods is the second stage in the move- ment from nature to culture. The first moment is the establishment of laws (nomoi) to punish those who do wrong (examartanein) or are guilty of hybris (vv. 7-8). But the laws are said to deter only open wrongdoing, not secret crime. This contrast between public legality and secret freedom from restraint has a striking parallel in the contemporary text of Antiphon, which insists that a person would treat justice in the way most beneficial to himself if "he holds the laws in high esteem in the presence of wit- nesses, but when alone without witness, he prefers the tendencies of nature," on the grounds (says Antiphon) that "in most cases, justice accord- ing to law (nomos) is hostile to nature (physis)" (DK 87B.44). This text of Antiphon clearly prefigures the antithesis between natural and conven- tional justice so eloquently developed by Callicles in the Gorgias. And it is the same antinomian morality that is parodied by the Unjust Logos in the Clouds (1070-82). The Sisyphus speech is the most extreme expression of this atmosphere of moral cynicism, documented in the Antiphon fragments and caricatured in the Clouds. All three texts represent conventional morality as an artificial device, imposed upon a state of nature in which human beings</page><page sequence="14">260 CHARLES H. KAHN behave like beasts, where force and cunning prevail. In a previous publi- cation I have argued that the theory of the social compact (as a natural- istic account of the origin of law and morality) did not originally bear this character of cynicism or antimorality.'8 The Ionian archetype may have been a more positive account in which the establishment of nomoi and lawcourts appeared as a decisive moment in the rise of culture. This early account probably implied a celebration of the human achievement of life in the polis, as in Plato's Protagoras and the Antigone chorus. After all, the possession of nomos and dike is the badge of human civilization for Hesiod and Heraclitus, for Aeschylus in the Oresteia, as for well as for Plato's Protagoras and the Sophoclean chorus. The negative view of nomos and the glorification of physis is a secondary phenomenon, reflect- ing the late fifth century environment in which Enlightenment turns to cynicism. The sources of this cynical turn are surely manifold: social, political and intellectual, including the long war, the plague, and political excesses of all sorts. But the conservative enemies of philosophy were not entirely mistaken. An important contributing factor to the atmosphere of moral cynicism was the rise of theological scepticism, signaled by Protagoras' dictum concerning the gods, and reinforced by the naturalistic accounts of religious belief developed by Democritus and Prodicus. All of this is brilliantly reflected in the Sisyphus fragment. Let me conclude with a few points of comparison between Sisyphus' tale about the gods and the contemporary theories of Democritus and Prodicus. The most obvious parallel is between the Sisyphean sophos, the clever inventor of the gods, and the logioi, the learned articulators of Democritus B.30, who raise their hands to heaven, "to the place where we Greeks now call aJr," and announce that "Zeus knows everything, and gives and takes away everything, and is king of all." Like Sisyphus' cunning legislator, the institutors of religion according to Democritus also relied on the human fear of celestial phenomena (Democritus A.75). What is lacking in Democritus' version is any clear statement that the theo- logical teaching is false. The Democritus text seems to suggest that the founders of religion were philosophers like Diogenes, who posited a cos- mic god situated in the air. Of course Democritus' own cosmology allows no place for such an omniscient deity. At the same time, Democritus' the- ory of religion contained enough positive elements (notably in the theory 18 "The Origins of Social Contract Theory," in The Sophists and their Legacy, ed. G.B. Kerferd, Hermes Einzelschrift 44 (1979), pp. 92ff.</page><page sequence="15">THE SISYPHUS FRAGMENT 261 of divine eid6la) for him to escape the charge of atheism.'9 Prodicus, on the other hand, is reported to have denied that the gods exist, and he does appear in the doxographical lists of atheoi.20 Prodicus' theory recognized two distinct stages in the development of religion, con- ceived as part of a general account of the rise of civilization: 1) primitive mankind stood in awe of those elements of nature on which their exist- ence depended: sun and moon, rivers, fruits of the earth. So they wor- shipped such benefactions of nature as gods. 2) as culture developed and gifted individuals contributed beneficial inventions such as agriculture, these benefactors were also worshipped as gods, notably Demeter and Dionysus.21 Prodicus' theory admits more than one interpretation. Philodemus and Sextus count him as atheist, and Henrichs has interpreted him as father of Euhemerism.22 But Teresias in the Bacchae cites a Prodicean view to jus- tify the worship of Dionysus.23 And Plato presents Prodicus as a rather harmless character, not as a moral sceptic like Callicles or Polus. The con- ception of Demeter and Dionysus as givers of grain and wine leads eas- ily to an allegorical interpretation that can be used (as later by the Stoics) to give rational support to the traditional cult. Later doxographers may have correctly diagnosed the atheism latent in his theory, but there is no hint of any legal charge of impiety being lodged against Prodicus. Living in Athens, Prodicus was perhaps also being cautious. What is clear in any case is that the atheism of Sisyphus is more out- spoken and more aggressive than the theories of either Democritus or Prodicus. And that is presumably no accident. It is a striking fact that the '9 Democntus is apparently never included in the doxography lists of atheists. Protagoras and Prodicus are named as atheoi by Sextus (adv. math. 9.51-2 and 55-6), but neither appears in the shorter list cited by Aetius and Galen (Doxographi Graeci p. 297 and pp. 617f.). For evidence from Diogenes of Oenoanda concerning Democritus' theory of divine eidola in sleep, see Diskin Clay in AJP 101 (1980), 357. 20 See the text of Philodemus in A. Henrichs, "Two Doxographical Notes: Democ- ritus and Prodicus on Religion," in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 79 (1975), p. 107: "He said that the gods worshipped by human beings (ncbo `r6v avOp&amp;nrwv vogn- Cogc'vouq Oeouv) do not exist." In Sextus' list (cited in previous note), Prodicus appears between Diagoras and Theodorus, the most notorious atheoi. 21 Following Henrichs (1975), p. 111. 22 "The Sophists and Hellenistic Religion: Prodicus as the Spiritual Father of the Isis Aretologies," Harvard Studies 88 (1984) 139-58. 23 Bacchae 274-85. Dodds (ad loc.) regards Prodicus as a "modernist," and com- pares his view to that of the Stoics.</page><page sequence="16">262 CHARLES H. KAHN most radical expressions of moral cynicism in the late fifth century are to be found in dramatic dialogue with fictitious characters, like Sisyphus and the Unjust Logos of the Clouds, or in the semi-fictional context of the Melian Dialogue. Even the fragments of Antiphon seem to be more cir- cumspect, less aggressively hostile to morality. We can only imagine what Athenians of this period would have said or thought in private. Probably no public figure and no author writing in his own name would be as out- spoken as these three literary characters are, or as Callicles will be later in the pages of the Gorgias. That is presumably why the Sisyphus text is so extraordinary: the conventions of the theater allow the gangster type to speak openly.24 University of Pennsylvania 24 Note that in a later, more cynical age, a view not unlike that of Sisyphus will appear in the respectable pages of Polybius (VI.56.11-12).</page></plain_text>
