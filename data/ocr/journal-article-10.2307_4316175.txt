<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ritual Death, Patriarchal Violence, and Female Relationships in The Hymns to Demeter and Inanna Marcia W D-S. Dobson The ancient Greek Hymn to Demeter, dating from the seventh century B.C.E., and the Sumerian Hymns to Inanna, set down some one thousand years earlier in the ancient Near East, are among the first writings we possess celebrating and documenting seasonal rituals to a "great goddess" who incorporates in her sacred presence the powers of vegetation, agricul- ture, and the cosmic laws.' Each work shows the marks of the cultural/historical period in which it was written, and each is shot through with textual mysteries that lure us to seek its ritual origins in a much earlier, possibly prepatriarchal paradigm. Crucial to the goddesses' significance in both myths is a dyadic relationship with another primary female divinity who is inextricably linked with death.2 The primordial quality of these relationships has led classical and feminist scholars into widely differing interpretive attempts. The kinds of answers we receive always depend on the kinds of questions we ask, and the kinds of questions we ask always depend on our particular personal and cultural needs and perspectives. Classicists and Near Eastern scholars ask about origins. In general, they provide "objec- tive" cultural, linguistic and historical information about both the texts and the worlds those texts represent. Many of them seek to be minimalist in their theoretical methodology. Only fairly recently have classicists begun to accept comparative anthropological, mythological, and literary theoreti- cal approaches as valid.3 Feminists, on the other hand, tend to use classical sources and scholarship as a medium for social, spiritual, psychological, and political inquiries and transformations of a Western patriarchy that began with these very sources. I do not mean to imply that there are no feminist classical philologists. However, our critical methodologies often conflict, and we deal with these conflicts constantly.

Yet precisely such interpretations have transformed the lives of women and have had a major influence in the recent popularity and rebirthing of ancient mythologies in our culture. Can traditional scholars accept and learn from feminist interpretations? Can feminists, in turn, learn from a more traditional, philological approach? Let us begin with a fairly simple recounting of differences in the ways feminists and traditionalists look at the Hymn To Demeter. Feminists tend to view the Hymn from three perspectives. First, we consider the text to be a reflection of a much earlier socio/religious world that emphasized a ritual, nonhierarchical way of life centering on cycles of fertility and rebirth and on primary female divinities. Second, we see the Hymn as depicting a violent takeover of this goddess-centered world by a patriarchy which resulted in disastrous consequences for both that early society and for women ever since. Finally, we see in the myth a crucial, contemporary psychological paradigm for inter- and intra-personal relations between women, especially mothers and daughters.4 More traditional, historically oriented interpretations seek to delineate carefully what the Eleusinian Mysteries were, to probe the central secrets of the cult, and to see how far back evidence for the cult can actually be established. In these interpretations, the rape of Persephone stands without judgment, probably because it appears to patriarchal culture as an acceptable metaphor for the transition of a young girl from maidenhood to marriage, and for the natural if painful expression of the separation that occurs as seasons cycle and time and mortality are brought into the world. This perspective is quite circumspect in its statements regarding the relations of the Eleusinian Mysteries to a great goddess religion, given the hypothetical nature of the evidence. It will not accept contemporary paradigms in psychology as culturally relevant for the sixth century B.C.E., and it is blind to the notion of a destructive patriarchy, a term which it sees as so generic as to be falsifying. I would like in this essay to illuminate ways in which the three above- mentioned feminist views of the Hymn can gain a sense of cultural embeddedness and historicity through attention to the way the language and mythemes of the texts radiate and spin out to evoke other linguistic and mythic associations. I am influenced as well in my textual interpreta- tion by post-Jungian work on archetypal theory, feminists who speak in new relational terms about identity and self, and feminist archaeological scholars who are trying to overcome western hierarchical thinking in their consideration of pre-Mycenean, and pre-Western periods. I believe that a close examination of the texts with these perspectives in mind will reveal multiple closely interwoven symbolic relationships connecting the themes</page><page sequence="3">44 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson of ritual, relationship and violence in such a way as to deepen insight and to mitigate theoretical differences. There is little question that the Hymn to Demeter is a major piece of literary and perhaps cult evidence for the worship of a great goddess of agriculture and her daughter, and that it pertains to the seasons and therefore to cycles of fertility. It is virtually the only surviving writing concerning the Eleusinian Mysteries, without doubt the most influential and cosmopolitan of all the religious cults in Greece in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E..5 Feminists might well be heartened by the fact that the major annual religious rite of ancient Greece is a nine-day festival devoted to the worship of two female deities, Demeter and her daughter Persephone, for this suggests a less patriarchal perspective than that characteristic of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. However, the situation is not so simple, for the Hymn and the festival to which it belongs are profoundly paradoxical. The Hymn memorializes a very painful event-the abduction of a young maiden to the underworld, and the raging grief of her mother at her loss. The evocation of the cycles of fertility is set against the linear thrust of the desire for a blessed afterlife that motivates participation in the Mysteries, and the female-centered ritual is framed by a doctrine of salvation that appears to presuppose the necessity of the sexual domination of women and the agony of the mother-daughter separation. The story told by the Hymn is well-known. The Kore, or maiden, is playing in a meadow. She becomes fascinated by a blooming narcissus. As she is about to pluck the flower, she is seized by Aidoneus and taken to the underworld. Her mother, Demeter, searches and grieves for her for nine days and nine nights. When she is finally told what has happened, she becomes enraged. Disguising herself as an old woman, she enters the home of Celeus (a leading family in Eleusis, favored by Zeus), becoming nurse to Demophoon, the infant of Metaneira, and tries to make him immortal by anointing him with ambrosia and putting him into the fire every night. When Metaneira discovers this, she banishes Demeter from the house. Demeter reveals herself in her full goddesshood, and demands of Celeus that a temple be built for her. It is to this temple that she withdraws, swearing to Zeus that she will make all the earth barren until he returns her daughter. Zeus finally permits the Kore to return (here for the first time called Persephone), but because she has eaten of the pomegra- nate in the underworld, she can only stay with her mother for a third of the year. The language of the Hymn operates at two levels, the first of which works through image and metaphor, implicitly evoking a matristic world of cyclical, agricultural ritual. The second works on the linear, narrative level, and tells the story of patriarchal domination summarized above.</page><page sequence="4">Demeter and Inanna 45 The beginning of the Hymn reverberates with ritual force and mystery. Each image of beauty and life is also an image of death. The golden wheat Demeter holds is synonymous in Greek with the sickle that harvests it (chrusaoros). The narcissus in its hundred-headedness gleams wet with fertility, yet Hades, who mirrors the narcissus' multiplicity through his name, Polydektes, "receiver of many," is the god of death in the under- world. This narcissus is the seducer of the Kore, and will lead to her death and fertilization through her own plucking of it. It is honored in its holiness by all mortals and immortals. Even the sea, the earth and sky smile in the sweetness of its scent. But the smiling, gaping mouth presages the gaping earth that will swallow the Kore. The word for gape in Greek is chazdo, reminding us of the word chaos, or chaos, from the same root. The narcissus is itself called athurma, which, although adequately translated "toy," or "plaything," also implies an object of magical transformation.6 Thus the opening imagery of the poem suggests that all the powers of nature acquiesce in the descent of the Kore as part of a magical and fertile cycle of transformation. The female powers are implicated in this as well. For we learn that this "toy" or athurma itself is given "as a deception" or dolon by none other than Gaia, the Kore's grandmother. When we put this together with the description of the Kore's face as a "bud about to bloom" (kalukopis) and with the description of her playmates, the daughters of Okeanos, as blossoms; when we learn that the word korai (plural of kore) means the "shoots of plants," there can be little question that the Kore is also identified imagistically with the narcissus.7 As she reaches out with both hands, "amazed," thambas, a word having connotations of being struck with ritual ecstasy, to take the athurma, one cannot help but wonder if the Kore is not in some sense involved in an act of self-plucking. We can certainly infer that she is caught up in a transformative act of death and rebirth, and that, speaking ritually and metaphorically, she draws to herself her own destiny. Further ritual implications of the imagery are embedded in the my- themes.8 For one, the maidens are in a leimon or "meadow." In Greek myth, it is difficult to be in a meadow without encountering doom. Meadows are places where death happens. But the word leimon also means female genitalia.9 To read through the images then, as the "bloom" is plucked from the "meadow," the virgin is deflowered and the genitalia open to disclose the yawning chasm which is the original place of birth and death, the womb of mother earth from which we all come and to which we all return.'0 And, as we know, although Polydektes may be identified with the narcissus through the equation of multiplicity, in the Hymn, Gaia herself, not the "Receiver of Many," sends the narcissus. At the same time, the poem tells us that Gaia's dolon, or "deception," was grown "at the will of Zeus," Dios bouleisi. Is this not a clear mark of patriarchal domination? Yes, on the explicit, narrative level of the text. But</page><page sequence="5">46 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson implicitly there may well be a linguistic pun here that would resonate in the thematic repertoire of the oral poet, between the words Dios bouleisi and Eubouleus, who turns up in an Orphic version of this myth as the swineherd who falls into the chasm with his pigs together with the Kore." Swineherds are intimately related to sows and boars, both of which were sacrificed to Demeter and Persephone. Further, in the Thesmophoria, the other major Demeter festival of the year and an exclusively women's rite honoring fertility, pigs themselves are thrown into the earth at the time of female menses and then dug up again along with snake idols.'2 Again it would seem that the ritual mystery is orchestrated not by males but by females, who understand fully the nature of the cycles of birth, decay and rebirth. If we look further at metaphorical associations with the narcissus and flowers in general, we find other connections between the Kore and the narcissus. Although we might say that the hundred-headedness of the flower expresses an overdetermined phallic exuberance, it is equally possible that its multiple, receptive nature has female connotations. Further, flowers in Greek myth when they are associated with males have connotations distinctively other than phallic aggression. Hyakinthos and Narcissus himself in fact were originally beautiful young men, who were turned into flowers at their tragic deaths, Hyakinthos, because Apollo, who loved him, killed him by mistake, and Narcissus because he drowned trying to embrace himself in love. Both these myths involve vulnerable, beloved youths, whose deaths are correlated with a mirroring, identifying love. '3 The Kore reaches for the narcissus in an attempt to pluck it from the earth, but this gesture doubles back metaphorically to suggest that she needs to pluck herself from her childhood and her connections with her mother and grandmother in their guise as earth mothers. Her longing for a beauty that mirrors her own empowers her to move into a new and sexual stage of life that is identified with death. In other words, her own "narcissism" (which for a contemporary self-psychologist would be consid- ered healthy and psychologically necessary in her pubescent journey) indirectly brings about her death.'4 However, since she is both taken into her grandmother Gaia and is called up through the will of her mother Demeter, her death has different implications than those of Narcissus or Hyakinthos. She rises again in the spring as all flowers do. In this sense her death implies power rather than loss, power that allows the seasons to keep turning through the mediation of earth goddesses. Now, what do we do with the question of patriarchal violence? Aidoneus comes up in his golden chariot with his immortal horses and seizes the Kore away as she "screams laments," iachese orthia, "unwilling." Surely this is a rape! But once again, we are working on both the level of metaphor and the level of narrative. Through the imagery, we feel irremediable, sudden and violent separation. The earth opens, and shrill lamenting</page><page sequence="6">Demeter and Inanna 47 splits the sense of wholeness and serenity of a formerly unified cosmos. This is the first time sound emerges in the poem and it is of a particular sort: Iaxese is the same word that is used to refer to the cry of the Bacchantes as they go forward into the rite of sparagmos, or the tearing apart of live animals in a celebration of the fragmentation and eating of life that the world may renew itself. Orthia are shrill cries often connected with death laments. In other words, what was whole has suddenly split with sound and is gaping, and it has happened through a "snare," dolos, a deceitful trick of mother earth herself. The maiden herself cries like a bacchant. The sea, earth, and sky, all pre-Olympian animistic powers, have brought about the gaping through their own smiling acquiescence. The gaping earth mirrors the smiling mouth as much as the womb opening to receive the seed, which is, in this case, also the maiden. At this implicit level the images defy separation; they cannot be pulled apart. Flowers pluck flowers, and the generations are convoluted, spring- ing and rounding back on each other. The Kore is in fact indistinguishable from her mother or her grandmother. According to other variants of the myth, it is impossible to tell who is the mother of whom, or who gets raped. Demeter and Rhea, Demeter's mother in this Hymn, have both been called the mother of the Kore, Demeter participates in the Hymn as both mother and daughter, and both Demeter and the Kore have been thought to bear the same child."5 It seems as if in this particularity of violence, time is struggling to be born in the only way it can: through the recognition of violent separation, the splitting apart of the whole into the halves of mother and daughter, or the older and younger parts of the female. In this way, Demeter's grieving is understandable, not only as the grieving of a mother for her daughter in today's individuated terms, but also as that of a woman for a younger self that had to be renounced. Iconography confirms this view. One of Jane Ellen Harrison's insights, since documented by the studies at Catal Huyuk and at Hacilar, is that originally Demeter and the Kore were one. In fact, it was not until the Homeric Hymn that we see them even defined as Mother and Daughter. As Harrison says: "They are, in fact, merely the older and younger forms of the same person; hence their easy confusion."'" We also know from our collected ancient sources that both Demeter and Persephone are simulta- neously death and birth goddesses; both represent the flowers of spring and the furied destruction of the underworld; both have been raped. In effect, we have a two-in-one representation: an older and a younger manifestation of the goddess which together express the cyclical nature of the story and of the seasons.'7 The Kore whose name is never anything but generic (Kore means no more than maiden), as bacchant, as her own mother, as the seed and the seeded, is a vehicle for the presentation of time through seasonal transformation. At the imagistic or "matristic" level, the Hymn to Demeter evokes and</page><page sequence="7">48 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson celebrates a crucial moment of fertilization that is conditioned on fragmen- tation and sacrifice. No life can occur without death. Death is embraced with ritual laughter so that life may begin again. Let us now turn to the narrative, "patriarchal" level of the poem. Demeter does appear as a mother who has lost her child. Zeus has willed the rape, Aidoneus has accomplished it, the Kore screams in distress. Demeter searches for her daughter, and her grief turns to overwhelming rage when she learns from Helios what Zeus has done. She appears fully disempowered, until she attempts to make the child Demophoon himself immortal. But even this fails. If the metaphorical language convinces us that this cycle of fertility is a natural process brought about by the female, what is the reason for the rage of Demeter against Zeus, that has been so acutely noted by femi- nists?'8 On the narrative level, we are not in the presence of the seasonal cycles, but of goddesses, gods and mortals who have a sense of individu- ality, of separation, of place in the cosmos. There are cities and temples and divisions in relationship, and there are deep and divisive emotions. In fact, we are within the ordering of a Greek patriarchy.'9 It is crucial to see that as soon as we have the generational doubling that allows the presence of time, as soon as one is named "mother" and the other "daughter," we are in the context of an already established pa- triarchy. Thus, the defining characteristics of the mother-daughter rela- tionship have been determined by how that relationship functions within the patriarchy. This raises the issue of the relation of time and consciousness to patriarchy. In itself, time, even when it is cyclical, necessarily invokes separation through decay, death, and rebirth. But when the separation is set within a linear, patriarchal context, there is a concomitant sense of radical diremption, of pain and violence in separation that goes far beyond mourning and searching, and appears to negate and contradict all sense of acquiescence to an inevitable, if painful, cycling of death and rebirth implicit in the imagery of the Hymn. Another related issue, given the highly patriarchized context of Greece in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E., is the participation of men in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and the way in which their perspectives played into and shaped the myth. According to Jung, the Demeter/Kore figure at the center of the cult "exists on the plane of mother-daughter experience, which is alien to man and shuts him out. In fact, the psychology of the Demeter cult has all the features of a matriarchal order of society where the man is an indispensable but on the whole disturbing feature."2" Kerenyi disputes this interpretation, noting that men also participated in the cult and gained strength and the sense of salvation from the ritual acts. In his view, the rape of the Kore is the metaphorical equivalent of the violence that men no less than women must experience in order to be receptive to</page><page sequence="8">Demeter and Inanna 49 the Mysteries. He points out that during the Mysteries, men actually "entered the figure of Demeter and became one with the Goddess," and that the historical evidence indicates that the initiate regarded himself as a goddess rather than a god.2' Kerenyi suggests that the metaphorical identification of the male with the female enables him to surrender to the death that must precede spiritual rebirth. Two assumptions seem to underlie the above interpretation. The first is that men need to become more receptive and willing to relinquish control; the second is that such yielding to the inevitable has to be experienced as an act of seizure that enforces surrender, and this is presumed to come naturally to women. These assumptions imply that a woman accepts death because she knows the cycles of growth and decay intuitively in her own body, and she is, as Jung says, psychologically at one both with her female ancestors and her female descendants. However, because the male connec- tion to the natural rhythms of life and death are not as immediate, a man experiences his mortality as a devastation of his individuality. A man does not simply mourn what he must necessarily lose. He rages against his mortality and against woman and nature for reminding him of it, and he invents a myth of eternal wholeness, an Isles of the Blessed where diremption is fully overcome. This interpretation sheds light on another paradoxical aspect of the Eleusinian Mysteries-namely, the incongruity between the cyclic pattern of what is being represented and celebrated-and the forward thrust of its driving motive. The ultimate goal of the Mysteries is not the acceptance of the natural cycles of death and rebirth figured in agriculture, but rather, the overcoming of this cyclic pattern and the attainment of a permanent afterlife.22 There is no question that the Hymn offers evidence for a violent patriarchal takeover which has reverberations on relationships between women. Both the overt narrative of the poem and the Mysteries which appear to have used the myth for their text show evidence of a kind of male thinking about women's natural association with fertility and agri- cultural cycles that puts women in a position of yielding and being dominated. Kerenyi's interpretations as well, although perhaps not without crucial insight in regard to the mother-daughter relationship, eternalize and universalize the so-called feminine response to being raped in a way that shows his own demoralizing patriarchal inheritance. All this said, we may well need to distinguish the masculine perception of death as violent and fragmenting from the feminine view that it is an inherent part of the natural cycle and for this reason is not necessarily violent, even if it is desolating. Contemporary feminists who have adopted male definitions of assertiveness and power do not perceive that the willingness and receptivity of females to go through inevitable processes of death and decay may represent a different form of power.</page><page sequence="9">50 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson Sylvia Perera, in her excellent text, Descent to the Goddess, understands that the receptivity of Inanna, The Sumerian Queen of Heaven and Earth, is not passivity, but potency. One of the many stories inscribed on the cuneiform tablets that give us our fragmented knowledge of the goddess describes her willing descent to the underworld, where Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld, compels her to divest herself of all the symbols and marks of royalty and cosmic power and then hangs her on a hook "like a piece of decayed and rotting meat." The only thing that will assure Inanna's return to the upperworld is her promise of providing a living substitute. Inanna, emerging from the netherworld, "fastens the eyes of death" upon Dumuzi, her former bridegroom, who is consequently torn apart and cast below. Dumuzi's sister, Geshtinanna, pleads for him and agrees to exchange places with him for six months of the year. Ereshkigal herself, perhaps an original creatrix deity, appears to have been carried into the netherworld as its "prize," reminding us of the Kore.23 Of Inanna's willingness it is said: From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear [also translated as heart] to the Great Below. My lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld.24 For the Jungian Perera, Inanna's willingness indicates "a non-pa- triarchized wisdom that understands the necessity for sacrifice and de- scent in order to gain wholeness.... This openness to being acted upon is the essence of the experience of the human soul faced with the transperso- nal. It is not based upon passivity but upon an active willingness to receive. "25 Perera understands Ereshkigal's rage and cruelty to Inanna on both ritual and psychological levels. First, it is rage against a patriarchy that has divided the original creatrix into Inanna, the good, the life-giver, and Ereshkigal, who must become a Medusa-like raging death goddess. Second, it is the rage of the repressed unconsciousness of Inanna, which consists of everything the patriarchy deems evil in her, and third, it is (as seen in the patriarchal perception of the Kore's descent as rape) a projection of the male fear of death that females do not share. For Perera, the "rape" of Ereshkigal is an indication as well of the repression of female power: From the perspective of patriarchy, the rape of the goddess establishes masculine rule over conscious cultural life (and perhaps over agriculture) and relegates feminine power and fertility to the underworld. Thus, when the god An seized heaven and Enlil carried off the earth, and con- sciousness had space to grow, then 'Ereshkigal was seized by the Great Below as a prize.' But from the perspective of magic-matriarchal con- sciousness, the goddess is not a prize to be carried out of life, nor is death a rape and destruction of life, but rather a transformation to which like the</page><page sequence="10">Demeter and Inanna 51 grain to the reaper, the goddess willingly surrenders and over which process she rules.26 Demeter, although a preeminent figure in cyclical rituals, is caught up as well in Olympianism. Her goal appears to be to escape death and mortality. Demeter moves with difficulty to receive the wisdom of the more ancient powers who smiled at the blooming narcissus that opened the underworld for the Kore. She feels, as a mother, the dominating violence involved in the ripping away of her daughter. She regards herself as separate. Demeter's desire for immortality, the stopping of time, is evident in her attempt to make the child Demophoon an immortal substitute for her daughter, as well as in her rage that her daughter must spend a third of her life in the underworld and cannot be unified with her forever. Inanna, however, demands that Dumuzi (Demophoon's sacrificial parallel) be sacrificed to the underworld precisely because he believes that the world of the city he rules need not take notice of her, or the cycling of the seasons. Dumuzi's manner of death metaphorically confirms Perera's sense that death conceived as violent is a masculine projection. The written text, in all probability a patriarchal revision of an earlier matristic myth, shows him frantically attempting to escape the netherworld by becoming a snake and then a gazelle, ironically both symbolic animals of Inanna. His death is one of violent fragmentation.27 Through this punishment, he spends half the year in the netherworld, but is then replaced by his sister Geshtinanna through her own empathic and willing act. Dumuzi's death reaffirms the agricultural, cyclical order as well as the necessity of being receptive to change and that is exemplified by both Inanna and Geshtinanna. So, if we are to return to the origins of these profound ritual myths of cosmic cycles, we may see that women, unlike men, do not understand transformation as violence. We do not need "rape" as a metaphor for going into death; indeed, our power lies precisely in our receptivity and ability to identify with life's cycles. Nevertheless, Perera's emphasis on the shadowy, destructive side of the configuration is important. It confirms what numbers of feminists have a tendency to overlook, that even in female ritual there is a necessity for sacrifice, for the loss of identity, and death, in order that transformation and rebirth may occur.28 It implies that bringing ourselves together in wholeness, in our relation to cycles of birth and transformation commits us to processes of creation and decay. In short, it is not the father Zeus or Hades alone who destroys. Nor is it only the hunter who sacrifices.29 Destruction is natural to the cosmic cycle, and both men and women in the matristic society to which these fragments originally hark back feel themselves to be deeply connected with this cycle. Pa- triarchal violence is merely an addition and a distortion of what is a natural process. Over the past decade, numerous books interpreting the Greek god-</page><page sequence="11">52 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson desses as archetypal mirrors for our understanding of ourselves as women have been published by Jungian feminist psychologists and those inter- ested in women's spirituality.? It is because of such feminists that scholarly information, once of interest only to classicists has become not only popular, but crucial to many in the formulation and rethinking of the female (and male) self. But the appropriation of goddesses for the elucidation of contemporary psyches is problematical. For example, Jungian analysts, such as Jean Shenoda Bolen in her Goddesses in Everywoman, or Jane Barker and Roger J. Woolger in The Goddess Within, identify each goddess as a paradigm of a particular constellation of archetypal energy: e.g., The Demeter Woman, the Persephone Woman. They urge us to discover the one with whom we most identify, and then to bring together the others in our lives to construct a whole and healthier person. Yet those who use the Olympians as eternal archetypal models forget that the Olympians themselves are products of a socially contrived patriarchy. And even when this is recog- nized, and the goddesses are read as "archetypal case histories," that hold, as the Woolgers say, "remnants of the older Mother religions and clear indications of the opposition and manipulation of the goddesses by the more favored male gods," we are still moving within the limited range of male-defined categories for women.32 Since the Olympian goddesses were indeed formulated and categorized by the Greek patriarchy itself, then they should not be taken uncritically as paths by which we can transcend this patriarchy. I see a further problem in personalized readings into the ancient myths. Many feminists who do so are also well aware of the pre-Greek ritual components of the myths, but do not seem to be aware of the dissonance created by speaking of ritual figures as twentieth century personalities. I quote at random: Persephone seeks a savior in powerful people, but her deep attachment of helplessness, innocence and unconscious rage only makes her feel cut off as if by some ever-widening gulf. And what is that gulf but the descent to Hades she will not take? In all these defenses she is still crying out for all- powerful Daddy Zeus to deliver her, to longed for Mother Demeter to restore the comfort and innocence of an utterly wretched childhood." This sounds more like the description of a contemporary dysfunctional adult who did not receive sufficient nurture as a child, than like the evocation of an archetypally profound psychological experience. Further, it is scarcely an accurate portrayal of Persephone. There is no mention at all in the Hymn of the Kore's childhood. Therefore, we cannot call it either wretched or comfortable. All we really know is that she was abducted while picking flowers with her friends, and that her mother grieved for her so much that Zeus allowed the Kore to return for part of the year. In Too Long</page><page sequence="12">Demeter and Inanna 53 A Child: The Mother Daughter Dyad, Nini Herman hypothesizes a Demeter who is overbearing and suffocating, especially insofar as she is so unwill- ing to let her daughter go, and deals with problems of independence that daughters have in letting go of mothers in our society. But again, with the powerful, ritual substructure of the Hymn inviting us into the mysteries of death and rebirth in the invocation of the cosmic cycles of renewal, this personalization appears distorting and limiting. It strays from the explicit narrative of the myth as well, in that the goddesses become in their interpretation fairly mundane paradigms of the fragmented females representative of our patriarchy. Part of the reason that Jungian archetypalists such as Bolen and others only limit our perceptions and possibilities is that the archetypes as they describe them are static, separate, and stereotyped. I suspect that the problem is that although they have experienced the power of archetypal presences, when they describe them they do so as if they are seeing archetypes as discrete, externalized objects. Christine Downing under- stands much more sensitively that in using Goddesses to move us toward wholeness, we need to view them not just as figures, but as part of the process of a mythic pattern. As she says: I have come to understand, also, through my involvement with this myth, the difference between relating to a myth and relating to a mythological figure. It seems vitally important no longer to identify with only one character in the myth, Persephone, nor to focus on one episode within the story, Persephone's forced abduction by Hades. This transformation was not something at which I deliberately aimed. There was rather a gradual and seemingly inevitable discovery of how all the elements of the myth necessarily belong together, so that I now see that the myth is the mythos, the plot, the action, not the figure abstracted from it.34 Stephen Simmer, says this in a way that is attentive to the language of the text as well: Texts and complexes always imply (from L. implico, 'entwine') one another. Texts may be read as complex-ions of the soul's entanglements, where complexes take on text-ure through the tangled associations and ambigu- ities of language.... It is as if the binding of a complex were a service demanded by the gods, as if the 'yarns' of the myths were spun from the entanglements which trap US.35 Approaches such as Simmer's and Downing's suggest a symbolic web- bing that occurs between myth and the psyche through "tangled associa- tions and ambiguities of language," allowing us to move to greater levels of self-awareness through complex imageries that reflect our shifting psychic processes. This approach keeps us from seeing goddesses as discrete archetypes that can all too readily turn into stereotypes.36 This search for new vocabularies to explore psychic and linguistic</page><page sequence="13">54 Marcia W. D-S. Dobson relationships and to do away with standard oppositional and metaphysical frameworks is akin to the project of Jean Baker Miller and other feminist social psychologists from the Stone Center at Wellesley College in Mas- sachusetts, and philosophers of religion, particularly Catherine Keller.37 These scholars have begun to think in new linguistic terminologies that interact interestingly with the findings of archaeologists and iconogra- phers such as Marija Gimbutas and Lucy Goodison, who study peoples from the "prepatriarchal age."38 These studies suggest that viewing the ancient hymns in frameworks of language that do not polarize autonomy and fusion, but rather speak in terms of non-hierarchical relationships through which and because of which difference becomes possible, can bring us deep and perhaps transforming insight both into the human psyche and into the Hymns themselves. In her work with prepatriarchal symbols, Marija Gimbutas tries to show a way in which, despite the primal power of the goddess, any understand- ing of her as transcendent or specifically anthropomorphic misses the point. The goddess is immanent in all natural processes of death and regeneration. The flower is not just a manifestation of the Kore's pubes- cence, both the flower and the Kore are participants in the processes of transformation. It is the Goddesses' symbolic polyvalence that we fail to perceive, given our Western perspectives. The process of seasonal awakening, growing, fattening, and dying was seen as connecting humans, animals, and plants: The pregnancy of a woman, the fattening of a sow, the ripening of fruits and crops were interrelated, influencing each other.... The rising and growing powers of earth dwell in all living things... each protuberance in nature, be it a mound, a hill, on a menhir or on a female body-belly, buttocks, breasts, knees-was sacred.39 Catherine Keller echoes Gimbutas: Daughters... may find themselves empowered and not drowned by the subtle religiosity of oceanic feeling, learning to differentiate themselves in and through an intimate bond with the universe. Thus the symbol of the Mother Goddess reemerges today, not as an illusory projection of an external omnipotence upon which creatures unilaterally depend, but as a life force, indeed, as a libido, internal to everything.40 It is this sense of differentiation in and through intimate bonding with the cosmos that emerges from the dynamic, symbolic interweavings of the Demeter Hymn. The intermingling and identification through ritual and the symbolic imagery of plants, divinities and humans brings us into a non- hierarchical world of language where distinctions emerge as meaningful only within the context of relational symbolic fields. There is a sense of being "empowered and not drowned by the subtle religiosity of oceanic feeling" as we see Gaia, Rhea, Demeter and the Kore emerge as figures simultaneously authoring sacred seasonal cycles of transformative renewal and immanent in them. Perera moves this vision of empowerment through</page><page sequence="14">Demeter and Inanna 55 relational and linguistic webbing to the level of psychological insight by interpreting Inanna and Ereshkigal as archetypal forces moving sepa- rately and together to impel internal psychic transformations. The kind of approach to the Hymns to Demeter and Inanna taken in this paper requires opening ourselves to specific mythic symbols, allowing them to constellate and then to radiate out to other parts of the larger mythic context which reside beyond a given literary work, engaging at the same time in the play of narrative as it casts and recasts its threads through these images to construct its own cultural, historical story. It asks of feminist thinkers a detailed immersion in ancient works, which can enable us to see them as multi-layered interweavings of specific cultural, histor- ical, matristic and patriarchal elements. It asks of traditional philologists a willingness to risk expanding their field of cultural and psychic vision to allow readings across time and through symbolic relations that may never be grasped except through educated and empathic intuition. Traditional philologists and feminists can in this way work together to illuminate ever more profound levels of textual and psychic meaning.

'People from all over Greece came to Athens to attend the festival, drawn by the promise of a life in the Isles of the Blessed after death, attainable through participation in the sacred rites and initiation in the Eleusinian Mysteries. This was also a highly political event, bringing fame and importance to Athens, after it had joined forces with the Eleusinian priesthood. All participants in the Eleusinian Mysteries were held under an oath of silence not to reveal what they had seen. While archaeological remains and later literary fragments tell us fairly well what went on in the festival day by day, they reveal little about the central revelations. The Hymn, then, provides strange and tempting moments in which scholars believe they can discern what those hidden acts might have been. (Unfortunately, many hypotheses are highly suspect in that they originate from Christian apologists trying to negate or sensationalize the earlier religion.) For further information on this see N.J. Richardson, (ref., fn. 1); C. Kerenyi, Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter, trans. Ralph Mannheim, (New York: Pantheon, 1967); and George E. Mylonas, Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries (Princeton University Press, 1961). The Hymn is in fact a literary, not a cult document. It is part of a series of Homeric Hymns that became cosmopolitanized throughout Greece by the Homerists, and so needs to be seen also through the lens of a partly oral, partly literary tradition that embodies sophisticated myth-telling for entertainment. See Jenny Strauss Clay, The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989), Ch. 4. 6In the "Homeric Hymn to Hermes," Hermes refers to the tortoise that he will kill to create the lyre as an athurma. He tells the tortoise that alive it can help him with witchcraft, but that dead it will make beautiful music. Either way, it transforms the cosmos, but it is much more powerful in death. The athurma also suggests a transition across boundaries that are always held in question. For how this "toy" further reflects a magical object of transformation, see Marcia Dobson, "Herodotus I. 47.1. and The 'Hymn to Hermes': A Solution To The Test Oracle," American Journal of Philology (100: 3), 349-59. 70n korai meaning plant shoots, see Porphyry, quoted by Eusebios, Praeparatio evangelica III ii 7-9 (from Kerenyi, Eleusis, fn., p. 209). 8Oral poets' uses of formulas, according to our most convincing evidence, comes from a memory stored according to themes. That is, themes and formulae may be fully, though unconsciously, cross- referenced in the poet's mind. The same would be true of early written poetry. We are not sure how much of the Demeter Hymn was an oral composition, and how much was written. See Richardson, 11 and 333. 9See Mythologies, compiled by Yves Bonnefoy, tr. under the direction of Wendy Doniger (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991), 410. '?There is a familiar pun in Greek on soma, meaning "body," and sema, meaning "tomb." Further, the goddess of childbirth, Eileithuia, is identified in Crete as a shallow cave in the earth (not far from Knossos). These are only a few of many references connecting earth with the female body as both womb and tomb. "Kerenyi also identifies a Zeus Bouleus who is mentioned in connection with Demeter and Kore. "On Mykonos, while a gravid sow and a boar were sacrificed to the Two Goddesses on the 10th of Lenaion, season of Dionysos' winter birthday, a young pig was offered up to Bouleus." Other islands prayed to Zeus Eubouleus, "well-counseled Zeus," but only as a subterranean divinity. Thus the boule or counsel here is closely connected to Eubouleus, and through this to the swineherd of the Orphic tale. It is very difficult to determine at what stage of history the Orphic myths appeared to the culture. But when connected to a ritual this ancient, and participating in mystery lore as the other major mystery religion besides the Eleusinian Mysteries, we must assume that they were early indeed. See Kerenyi, Eleusis, 170-171. It is possible that the phrase "at the will of Zeus" may be formulaic entry into the myth by the Homeric poet-a common enough phrase for the poet of the Iliad, thereby merging unconsciously the name of Zeus into a rite of death and rebirth long legitimated by women. '2Clement (Orphic fragment 50), mentions "the Rape and the chasm in the earth and the pigs of Eubouleus which were swallowed up in the earth for the goddesses, which are the origin of the custom by which they throw swine into pits at the Thesmophoria." The story of Eubouleus may well be a local</page><page sequence="16">Demeter and Inanna 57 legend of Eleusis and therefore early. See Richardson, 81 ff.. For two excellent articles on the Thesmophoria with very different perspectives, see Froma I. Zeitlin, "Cultic Models of the Female: Rites of Dionysus and Demeter," Arethusa 15'/2 (1982): 129-57, and Betty De Shong Meador, "The Thesmophoria, A Women's Ritual," Psychological Perspectives: A Semi-Annual Review of Jungian Thought, 17:1 (Spring, 1986), 35-45. '3There is always a question in interpreting myth as to whether to see an entire myth text as providing radii for interpretation in any given document, even if the myth appears in another form only later in the literary records. The stories of Hyakinthos and Narcissus appear in Ovid and Apollodorus, both much later than the Demeter hymn, and the particular fates of these young men may well reflect the stories' later composition. On the other hand, the envisioning of tender adolescent men as blooms need not be a product of fifth century homoeroticism (which might be implied in both stories). On how myths transform and gain different status in the culture at different times, see Wm. Blake Tyrrell, Amazons: A Study in Athenian Mythology (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984). There are earlier cult and religious references to both young men. Hyakinthos may well have been a precurser to Apollo, and Narcissus is associated with mystic cults. See Eitrem, RE 16.1721 ff. There is also a reference in Sophocles, Oedipus Coloneus 683.f. to the narkisson as "The ancient garland of the great Goddesses." Richardson, 143, believes this to be a reference back to the Hymn; I am not so sure. '4In some understandings of the cult myth, the Kore actually does die and Persephone is seen as a different goddess altogether. See Mythologies, 410-11, and Gunther Zuntz, Peresphone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971).

'9For discussions concerning the occurrence of this myth during a period where matrilineality and matrolocality may have been the norm, which we are seeing through the patriarchal lens of the seventh and sixth century, see Richardson, 5-12. For the development of this patriarchy out of the pre-Olympian period, see DuBois (ref. fn. 3) and Lerner (ref. fn. 4), as well as Wm.

It alone was essential to all who visited Eleusis for religious purposes. On the other hand, the grain appears as a gift of Demeter even in the deepest stratum of Eleusinian mythology to which we can penetrate, and there is no doubt that the myth of Triptolemos leads us back to early archaic times, preceding the existence of the Homeric hymn." Eleusis, 128. 23The evidence for Ereshkigal's entry into the underworld is highly debated because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence. She may well have been the original Ninlil, or moon goddess, who followed her husband Enlil into the underworld there to become Queen. In any case, there appears to be a splitting of the upper and underworld goddesses in this particular Hymn that is all too reminiscent of the binary oppositions met up with so often in western documents and much more rarely in Sumerian myth. According to Kramer, it was "An (Father Heaven) who carried off heaven (that is, an), while it was their son, the air-god Enlil, who carried off the earth (that is, ki).... On closer examination this view seems rather puzzling and anomalous, since one might reasonably have expected that just as it was An (Father Heaven) who carried off heaven (an), it was Ki (Mother Earth) who carried off earth (ki). For some reason or other, one is forced to conclude, that the role of the goddess Ki, Mother Earth, had been usurped by the male deity Enlil" (From The Poetry of Sumer, 26-27). 24Diane Wolkstein and S.

It is possible that originally Persephone went down to the underworld without being raped by an underworld god. What is harder to believe is that this was not understood by both Demeter and Persephone as a much more grievous event than Spretnak suggests. See Charlene Spretnak, Lost Goddesses of Early Greece: A Collection of Pre-Hellenic Myths (Boston: Beacon Press, 1974), 105-128. 29There has been a great deal of discussion regarding sacrifice in women's rituals: whether there was any actual killing of animals or humans, to what extent the sacrifices were symbolic in action, etc. Key sources here are Walter Burkert, Homo Necans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology, Chapter 5: "The Ritual Love Death" (New York: Penguin Books, 1979), Mircea Eliade, A History of Religious Ideas (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978) Vol. I., 38-39, and Marcel Detienne, "The Violence of Well-Born Ladies: Women in the Thesmophoria," in Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant, The Cuisine of Sacrifice Among the Greeks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 129-48. Eliade is controversial, but useful in his discussion of three different kinds of sacrifices, one occurring in vegetal, one in hunting, and one in agricultural societies. Campbell deals in depth with the comparison between the West Ceramese Hainuwele myth and the Demeter/Persephone myth in regard to their vegetal nature. 30Perera, Descent To The Goddess, 8. 3Christine Downing, The Goddess: Mythological Images of the Feminine (New York: Crossroad, 1981); Jean Shinoda Bolen, Goddesses In Everywoman (Harper and Row: 1984); Nini Herman, Too Long a Child: The Mother-Daughter Dyad (London: Free Association Books, 1989); Helen M.
