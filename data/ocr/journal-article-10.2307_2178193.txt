<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. Vers une nouvelle conception du temps? J. PERkS. Rev. Ph., XXXVII, 12, pp. 602-6i6. To what extent are the concepts of space and time bound together? Are they becoming more and more inextricably connected, as a famous living mathe- matician declares? Schopenhauer typifies those philosophers in whom con- siderations of the spatial order predominate. For him the lot of the will is an eternal now; only the present exists, ceaselessly regenerated like the rainbow that maintains itself in the water-drops of a cascade. This conception of time is opposed not only to Hegel's historical point of view, but in general to evo- lutionary optimism,-the doctrine that past epochs were only stages of de- velopment having their raison d'etre in the state of things now realized. Kant represents an intermediate position, in that he did not allow the ideality of time to imply unreality in the temporal phenomenon. For this he was accused of inconsistency by Schopenhauer, who frankly reverted to Platonism. Present tendencies are in the opposite direction; and it is worth while to note some of the suggestions which have been incidentally advanced. We ordinarily think of time with especial reference to the future, the idea of the past inter- vening only to make the necessary contrast. Successive moments are thought of as constituting a progress. But some have said that it is quite as legitimate to represent the present as emerging from the future, and rolling backward toward the past. This view, however, is at odds with the interpretation of time which relates it to causality. According to the latter analysis, duration is composed of two elements, necessary succession and irreversibility. Necessary succession rests upon causality, pure and simple; but irreversibility implies the idea of means and ends. To relate time and ends in this way might appear to result in a sort of anthropomorphic finalist, or, at any rate, to savor of prag- matist doctrines. But may it not be that, as regards the conception of time, it is a legitimate function of pragmatism, not, certainly, to hypostatize a form of consciousness,-a duration that is felt and lived, but rather to emphasize the relativity of the time-consciousness? That relativity we are warned of by the trouble we have in showing how a succession of events is anything else than a projection outside ourselves of the idea of succession which is inherent in our mode of thought. E. T. PAINE. La signification et la valeur du pragmatism. H. ROBET. Rev. Ph., XXXVII, 12, pp. 568-60i. What Comte said of his time,-that it had witnessed a divorce between the mind and the heart, is equally true of the present era. On one side are science and philosophy, the former cold, impersonal, desirous only of knowing and 342</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 343 relating facts, the latter quite as dispassionate, finding its paramount concern in an absolute truth utterly removed from the realm of the concrete. On the other side is human nature, with feelings, desires, choices and ideals. The value of pragmatism lies in its ability to effect a reconciliation, the need of which other theories have ignored. Epiphenomenalism leads inevitably to Huxley's conclusion that the will is never the cause of a voluntary act, but only the symbol of a cerebral state which is the antecedent of the act. How absurd, then, for Huxley to insist elsewhere that "our volition counts for something as a condition of the course of events! " Parallelism is guilty of the same paradox. For what spontaneity can there be in a psychic series that merely corresponds to a succession of brain processes mechanically bound together? Sociology and ethics have not met the requirement, their failure being due to a fundamental error of empiricism, which has always devoted itself to the knowledge of what is, neglecting many phenomena of action and change, interpreting reality as all made in advance, and therefore unrelated to human problems and heedless of human interests and ends. But the worst offender, from a pragmatic point of view, is rationalism, with its false conception of the ideal. No doubt it is the task of reason to improve what experience finds deficient, and, with this purpose, to work by models of perfection. But to place those models outside of time is to withdraw from them all relation to human life. Another mistake of rationalism is its conception of pure know- ledge. True, it is an indispensable function of the mind to establish con- nections. But first comes the inverse operation of detaching from totality something upon which an independence, at least provisional, is conferred. The essential thesis of pragmatism is that the faculty of knowing,-of observa- tion and relation, is subordinate to this other operation of detaching, altering, acting. If knowledge is given first place, if one holds to the work of observing and relating for the sake of observing and relating, volition disappears, and with it all values, i. e., all reasons for action. But let one begin with activity. In return for what is gained there is demanded only the sacrifice of an arbitrary ideal which is incapable of verification, the abandonment of the outworn rationalistic notion of an achieved totality that could not possibly be increased, or suffer peril of any loss. E. T. PAINE. Natur- und Geschichtsphilosophie. FRIEDRICH KUNTZE. V. f. w. Ph., XXXVI, 3, PP. 381-412. Our author defines his position as Kantian and his point of view as that of transcendent realism. Collected human knowledge is treated as phenomena and with its formulas, appears to be in opposition to the Ding an sick, and to concern itself with pictures that are partly a creation of consciousness. Natural and historical science differ from philosophy in that they do not inquire into the metaphysics upon which they are based, but merely presuppose an ex- plainable basis. They are concerned only with relations that are among interrelated parts of human knowledge. A fact that can not be gauged or</page><page sequence="3">344 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. related to other facts is not a datum but a problem for science. The relation between science and the humanities is illustrated by their studies in music. The one analyzes music into vibrations and intervals, the other treats it as a synthetic whole in our conscious life. The outer and quantitative deductions are those of science the inner and qualitative relate to the humanities. Yet science may treat oi things and their ends, while history may treat of facts in series without causal relation. As a method for choosing facts Leibnitz formulated the theory of determinability and Kant worked it out more com- pletely in his Critique. It is based upon the interrelations of predicates rather than any principle of contradiction. It is the explanation of the process by which logical phenomena are pressed down into synthetic judgment and does not confine itself to the subject-object relation, but includes all deduction even presupposing the existence of the Infinite. If this statement, "there is a God" is made in the theoretical way that we say there is a square root of minus one, then it is meaningless, and only when it is stated in a pragmatic way does it become meaningful. II. Historical facts are made by nature and our concept of nature is formed by the facts observed; we thus have the foundations of empiricism and rationalism. These two limiting and critical principles guide us in the process of abstraction which is really the process of criticism. Thus, we secure natural law, a function of occurrence that gives us a cross-section of the general, and pure abstraction gives us the sharpest expression of the universal. We ourselves are ruled by phenomenal relations that control all phenomena. Consciousness is not a meaningless fiction but a function of relations between moments of happening. We can not show the relation between different phases of our consciousness as we can the logical relations of external phenomena according to the law of sufficient reason or determinability. In short, we may say that just as the struggle for existence is a scientific process within history, so is all science a part of history and con- versely history is only an incident within natural science. H. R. BROCKETT. The Reign of Science in the History of a Race. ALFRED H. LLOYD. Mind, N. S., No. 84, PP. 486-507. In the history of a race, by means of its sophistication and finesse, the reign of art succeeds the reign of law and is itself succeeded by the reign of science, in which the duplicity of candor and utility, of the rational and the commercial, is pronounced. But this same force, with its insight into the harmonies of nature and human possibilities, removes or transcends this duplicity. Un- consciously the race becomes agile, fluent and versatile, full of mechanical genius; with a strong yet impassionate enthusiasm it enters into life with an adventurous spirit and produces what is known as our modern machinery. By industrial conflicts and conquests it develops an inner, as well as an outer, cosmopolitanism and at the same time a recognized leadership. In the mental life this peculiar genius finds expression through the rise of natural science; by means of a superpoetic prose, a prose in which the thought tran-</page><page sequence="4">No. 3.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 345 scends the medium, it expresses its formally conservative yet curious and scientific interest in the mechanical and external world, conquered and mediated by its own finesse. In the life of affairs this genius gains recognition through the rationalistic and objective mediation of commerce and industry; labor becomes machinized, property dehumanized, and man, though remaining a social being, becomes a money getting machine. Everything human and natural is exploited; war is waged and peace gained for economic reasons. In the change from law to science, law becomes commercialized; injury, human association and morality are measured by monetary standards. However the people are not unemotional but mystic and take religion into their own hands. But because of the conflict of candor and utility an alliance is bound to come. The situation is unstable; candor cannot endure the ravages of commercialism, -it is to make a higher use of the latter's accumulations. In the conflict the spirit of life is liberated and it makes good use of the accumulated powers and treasures. Science, like art and law, is now fulfilled in a higher stage; this time in philosophy,-a new field in which the race is to make many advances. FRANK DICKINSON. Die Sprachphilosophie Lockes. KARL FAHRION. Ar. f. G. Ph., XXVI, I, pp. 56-65. The importance of Locke's Essay on Human Understanding rests almost wholly on the third book, upon which the further development of English philosophy is based. For in this book, he points out the significance of as- certaining the proper connection between ideas and verbal signs before be- ginning accurate investigation of any sort. Words help men to regard ideas (in themselves particular) as general or universal. In fact, Locke finds that most words of all languages are general and become so by being made the signs of general ideas. These ideas have become general by abstraction and induction. Thus we have the nominal and the real. The real is the particular true essence itself, whereas the nominal is the general class name, which dies as a fact to become an idea. However, words are naturally imperfect signs of ideas, especially of mixed modes and above all, of substances, for they are invariably liable to ambiguity. Undoubtedly, the thoughts of Locke are most profound in this third book, and though he shows his characteristic deficiencies, we cannot expect him to discover the final solution of a problem which he himself has originated. EMANUEL R. ENGEL. The Kinds of Poetry. JOHN ERSKINE. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., IX, 23, pp. 617-627. The historical study of literary genres, according to which poetry is classified according to the evolution of the language by which it is expressed, fails to observe the fundamental distinction between language and poetry itself. Poetry is not verse form, but an attitude towards life, which by the ordinary man is dissipated in action and by the poet is preserved in language. The</page><page sequence="5">346 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. kinds of poetry are not evolutionary growths, but eternal functions of life. In the three ways of meeting experience-in the emphasis on the past, the present, or the future-are to be found the definitions of the drama, the lyric and the epic. The lyric is the expression of immediate, transitory emotion, which has not subsided into a generalized frame of mind. The drama, though the characters in it are lyrical, dwelling in the present moment, is a reflection of the past, the harvesting of past deeds in harmony with the temperament of the characters. The situation has really nothing to do with the dramatic sense, save as it serves to display the character arraigned before the bar of his own past. Lyrical elements enter less frequently into the epic, which reveals life as a prospect of future destiny. To see the future promised in the present is a rare faculty, for that future often presents itself as a constant, rather than as a consequent of things as they are. But this feeling is not dependent on the belief in anthropomorphic gods guiding the world; the theory of evolution should bring us the conviction of destiny which we lack. Evo- lution, however, has focused solely on the past. The epic should be judged, not lyrically, by the behavior of the two, but by the consistency of its sense of an inexorable future. The study of poetry thus becomes the study of man's way of accounting for himself to himself, his eternal effort to restate life so that it will satisfy him, and the eternal moods through which the eternal effort is made. NANN CLARK BARR. The Nature of Consciousness. C. A. STRONG. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth. IX, 20, pp. 533-544, 20, pp. 56I-573, and 2I, pp. 589-603. According to Professor Strong, the term consciousness is used by the psy- chologists to denote the whole formed by our feelings, emotions, desires and sensations, and by logicians and epistemologists to denote bare cognizing or awareness, but it properly designates the awareness, sometimes accompanying cognition, of the states of mind by which we cognize. It is an another name for introspection, or for introspection plus its object. Certain existences- feelings, volitions, perceptions-are psychic in their original character. When we consider that clearness appears to be the character by virtue of which experience exists, we see that experience is essentially psychical, and that it is never, as some forms of objectivism hold, pure object. If the object is identi- fied withexperience asan existent,the subject is placed on this side of experience and so made non-empirical, while, if the object is beyond or on the other side of experience, though not out of its cognitive reach, experience itself, considered so far as it is psychical, may be the subject. A fundamental datum of the present inquiry is the image, defined in the sense of that which is sensibly dis- coverable in perception or cognition. As opposed to immediatism, whether in the form of naive realism or Berkeleian idealism, it is held that the object is not identical with the image or with a whole composed of images, but is something grasped by means of the image and existent beyond it or at least distinct from it. This view, or mediatism, must not be confused with the</page><page sequence="6">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 347 representative theory of knowledge, for though the image is conceived solely as the medium of knowledge, the object is not considered to be known any the less directly. Images are aspects or views. Not only do they present to us the outsides of things, but they present them from the point of view of the body. Hence it involves a false abstraction to ignore the body and make the images a pure and unadulterated revelation of the object. This theory not only opposes all forms of immediatism by mediatism, but also opposes phe- nomenism by what may be called psychism. Phenomenism is the view that the image is essentially a phenomenon and that its characters are objective. Psychism is the view that it is an existence sui generis, presenting an object not essentially, but, as it were, by accident. The fact of the lateness of the image establishes both the subjectivity of the image and the independent, ex- ternal existence of the object. The simultaneities in the image may corres- pond to successions in nature, and vice versa. The internal relations of the image are not those of the brain event. In analogy with the images on the plate of a photographic camera, visual images are flat, have no depth, and may be said to be inside the head. The image is the medium of sense-per- ception; is it also the vehicle of introspection or awareness? Awareness is the mere thinking of a thing, apart from any thought about it, and may be ana- lyzed as if it were entirely unaccompanied by thought. Introspective scru- tiny proves that the image is simply a form of feeling and that, if there is any awareness present, it is our awareness of it, not its awareness of the ob- ject. To explain awareness, we must not look outside or beyond the image itself to thought, for thought is simply other awareness. The relation in which awareness consists falls outside the mind. Awareness is not a psychical prop- erty of the mind considered as an existence. In order to explain the mecha- nism of awareness, we must premise that the objects of sense-perception have real existence and that these existences are in time and space. The fact of the time-gap proves the real existence of the object; variations in the time- gap according to the distance of the object from us prove its existence in space. If realism is true, we must consider, besides the object and the image,-the body, the sense-organs through which the image is mediated, the motor apparatus which the image sets off, consequently, the afferent and efferent relations of the image. This view, or projectionist, while holding that color and variety appear in cognition as qualities of the object, maintains that, as existences, qualities are in the image or subject. Self-transcendence it looks upon as purely logical. The cognitive character of the image is to be accounted for by the intelligent order of feelings not in themselves intelligent. J. R. TUTTLE. The Relation of Mind and Body, I. R. LATTA. Br. J. Ps., V, 3, pp. 280-29i. This problem is largely one of method. There are two main groups of theories, Parallelist and Animist. The mechanical principle of explanation, used by physical science, is a method or hypothesis assuming the self-complete- ness of the material world or system. This system includes everything but</page><page sequence="7">348 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. the non-material. The mental remains to be explained. Unwittingly, an independent psychical system is conceived analogous to the physical, and the mechanical method is applied to the explanation of it. This involves the difficulty of maintaining the mechanical method as a really scientific process. The adequacy of the mechanical principle as applied to living organic bodies is questioned by some. The animists and vitalists insist on the necessity of a teleological factor. But their actual hypothesis is objectionable in that it places this teleological factor entirely outside the mechanical system in the entelechy or in the soul. But teleology is really not external but immanent. To maintain itself as a really scientific hypothesis, mechanism cannot escape the admission of an immanent teleology. Hence teleology of this kind is a feature of the physical as well as of the psychical system, and thus the need of maintaining a Cartesian absolute disappears. Likewise the gulf between the physical and mental world disappears. We may make hypothetical abstractions but we have no right to convert these hypothetical abstractions into reality. All science is the finding of distinctions within a unity. Roy C. HOLL. The Relation of Mind and Body, II. HENRY J. WATT. Br. J. Ps., V, 3, PP. 292-307. I. Knowledge common to all is ultimately the basis of scientific problems concerning mind and body. 2, Any solution of the problem-even a tem- porary one-presupposes some sort of satisfactory knowledge of each of the correlated fields. 3. We may well refuse to make any reference here to phi- losophical problems concerning reality. 4. Connection between mind and body must rest upon some form of correlation between physical and psychical things. The problem of correlation must be stated from a psychical basis. The psychological facts are just the key to the arrangement of physiological facts. 5. The most direct attributes of sensation, commonly known as quality, intensity, extensity, local sign, duration, and position in time, provide a basis for the general problem formulated above. 6. McDougall attempts by the example of binocular vision to show that for certain psychical states no physical correlative is known or conceivable. But cannot the demands of a legitimate form of parallelism be fulfilled? 7. Fused unity (as binocular synthesis) does not differ radically and in every respect from its components. 8. A law of psychical identity is proposed. No attribute of experience offers exception to this law nor could any demand be made for a parallel unification of sub- servient neural processes. 9. The visual 'systemic' sign-the mark of individuality of the two fields of vision-may be considered as the psychical correlative of the separate central vocalizations of the effects of stimulation of' the two retina. Io. The law of the conservation of psychical identity does not seem to call for an operative agent. The postulation of the soul as the agent of unification of experience seems not only unnecessary but even to emphasize the problem. i i. Coordination of muscular response is involved with local sign. It becomes a condition of fusion (if not a sole ground of</page><page sequence="8">No. 3.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 349 fusion) in so far as it is based upon, and by its changes helps to modify, the local signs, which enter as attributes of sensations into the components of a complex process of fusion. Therefore it still seems possible to correlate com- pletely the complex psychical unity of binocular vision, fused according to the particular laws of psychical fusion, with the complex physical unity of binocular stimulation and response, coordinated according to the particular laws of neural coordination. Roy C. HOLL. Die Wurzeln des Pessimismus bei Schopenhauer. OSCAR SCHUSTER. Ar. f. G. Ph., XXVI, i, pp. 66-82. Arthur Schopenhauer had little use for the joys and fruits of life, for sensi- bility and intellectuality were to him supreme at all times. His emotional nature is manifest in many places of his chief work, and often times caused him much sorrow in his associations with men. Life was for him an intrinsic contradiction-a jest even, though a bitter one. His travels only made him realize all the more the misery of the world. Incidentally, Schopenhauer might here be likened to Augustine, one much greater than he, but also governed by powerful emotions, and one concerning whom Schopenhauer always spoke highly. Schopenhauer resorted to the transcendental and became a mystic. The roots of his pessimism are many. Early imprisonment in a mercantile calling must have strengthened his pessimism. As for his opinion of women, much has been written. For him, the all-important thing was his work and not the fortunes of matrimony. Another factor which made life so gloomy, was the condition of his home life. His father was found dead in an alley, and his mother ever became more estranged to him. Johanna Schopenhauer frankly confessed in a letter to her son, that the farther distant he was from her, the more it pleased her. Ultimately, the creations of art alone brought him relief. The reactions of the world against him only continued to increase his pessimism. Furthermore, as a pious individual, he possibly felt that he was liberating himself from worse suffering in the world to come, by doing repentance in this life. At any rate, Schopenhauer will always remain a character who commands our respect and admiration, for to him who con- sidered the goal of happiness so impossible and vain, life for noble ends seemed still worth living. EMANUEL K. ENGEL. La methode pathologique et le language actuel. F. LE DANTEC. Rev. Ph., XXXVII, 12, pp. 545-567. Many terms which pass for genuine are miserable counterfeits whose continued circulation threatens to compromise science. In mechanics, for example, a great word is force. Veritably, a term to conjure with! What governs movement? Force, to be sure, since the speed and direction of the object moved vary with the speed and direction of the force which moves it! That is (if people but knew), force is the reassuring name of a little invisible demon who does the work! Pathology, as well as mechanics, has been too much at the mercy of such explanations. The all-important fact established by modern biological science is the unity of the vital mechanism. A living</page><page sequence="9">350 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. being, in a state of health, exhibits no phenomenon that is truly local. Any change which untrained observation might regard as confined to a limited region of the organism, really affects the whole machine, and is the result of an activity in which the whole animal more or less directly partakes. But in spite of this well-known principle, pathological terminology is rife with expressions which deny it. A boy's voice deepens at puberty. Physiologists say that the change is due to a specific substance secreted by a bodily organ: to this substance they give the name hormone. As causing changes of ado- lescence in girls, other distinct chemical substances are postulated, each capable of producing modifications in a specific part of the organism. These substances also are called hormones. What actually occurs at puberty, however, is a unique and thorough-going modification of the entire organism; and this cannot be defined in terms of separable phenomena. Now note the abuse of language which grows out of baseless theories. It is bad enough to call purely imaginary substances by artificial names. How much worse to use for other hypothetical substances imitative terms, which, on account of their formation, convey the idea of resemblance to known substances! To illustrate: pathologists speak constantly of aggressines, antiphagines, agglutinines. The ending ine is borrowed from the names of vegetable alkaloids, like morphine, quinine and atropine. Of course the effects of alkaloids upon living beings are familiar and easily demonstrated. But the very existence of agglutinines is an un- warranted assumption. The reasoning that leads to the hypothesis is as follows. It is found that the serum of certain animals which have struggled against microbes of a given kind, has acquired the property of agglutinating the experimental cultures of those microbes. On this evidence is based the supposition that against thousands of different microbes the organism can produce at need the specific agglutinine, or chemical substance, which is required for the survival of the organism. In short, there are microbes; organisms do survive them; hence the agglutinines! The saddest consequence of such fallacies is the plausibility which they lend to final causes, thus in- serting into so-called pathological science an opening wedge for teleology. E. T. PAINE. Perception and Intersubjective Intercourse. WILLIAM W. CARLILE. Mind, N. S., No. 84, PP. 508-521. Neither Dr. Ward's division of experience into individual and universal, nor Mill's idea that matter is a possibility of sensation, do justice to the conception that the common world arises by the cooperation of many in- telligences. An examination of this problem will show that only primary qualities, which are in truth Kant's categories, are the product of intersub- jective intercourse and that the secondary qualities may be reached by in- dividual sensation. By referring to Hume's example of the crooked stick we see that primary qualities represent the reality by which we can pronounce the secondary ones illusion; in fact can we not say that they are the object, -the cause of the secondary qualities? The genesis of a concept of an object as well as the proof of the existence of an object is gained by intercourse.</page><page sequence="10">No. 3.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 35I Reality is a correlate of truth; both are products of intercourse and need verification, but this cannot be done in the present, consequently they are not one with sentience. The reality of the world is the substance that underlies qualities and the cause of sensible impressions. The identity of presentation for various minds furnishes, in a large measure, the basis of all that we can call reality. FRANK DICKINSON. Zur Beurteilung Sigers von Brabant. CLEMENS BAEUMKER. Philosophisches Jahrbuch, XXIV, i9ii. Autour de Siger de Brabant. PIERRE MANDONNET. Reprinted from Revue Thomiste, XIX, i9iI. Ur Siger von Brabant I &amp; II. CLEMENS BAEUMKER. Philosophisches Jahrbuch, XXIV, i9ii. In the July number of the PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, 1911, pp. 426-434, the present writer reviewed the second edition of Mandonnet's important work on Siger of Brabant. I there pointed out the part that Baeumker and Man- donnet had in the elucidation of the Siger problem, and also made the state- ment that in view of Baeumker's assertion in a note in his volume on Witelo that his view of the real Siger differs from that of Mandonnet, it would be desirable to have a more explicit expression of opinion from him on this point. This has now actually appeared in the articles named at the head of this notice. This is fortunate, though the immediate occasion that called forth Baeumker's statement of his views is not so. Mandonnet chose, in a note in his great work, to take Baeumker to task in a rather personal manner-in too personal a manner it seems to the impartial reader, who is interested in the subject matter only-for fancied grievances upon which the present writer prefers to refrain from passing judgment. As a result we have the reply and defence of Baeumker and the rejoinder of Mandonnet, and the counter reply of Baeumker as noted at the head of this article. What is scientifically of interest is the difference in the conception of Siger between Mandonnet and Baeumker, which is the purpose of this notice as a supplement to the review referred to above. They are both agreed that Siger is an Averroist, and that it was against him that Thomas Aquinas directed his treatise, De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averroistas. They differ in points of detail, which are of interest to the student of Siger. I. The reader of Mandonnet's book might have gone away with the im- pression that for Siger God is not the efficient cause of the sublunar world, but only the final cause. Baeumker pointed out that that was incorrect, and Mandonnet now admits that Baeumker's view is correct, and that while his own expressions in his book are ambiguous and might lend themselves to the interpretation Baeumker gave them, he (Mandonnet) did not mean them in that sense. When he said that for Siger God is only the final cause of the universe, but not the efficient cause of the sublunar world, he meant by efficient cause, direct efficient cause, namely direct creation as the Christian Aristotelians believed, whereas the Averroists, and Siger with them, held</page><page sequence="11">352 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. that God is the direct efficient cause only of the first Intelligence, the things of the sublunar world are made by God through the mediation of the In- telligences. Here, too, then, they both agree that for Siger also God is the efficient cause of the whole universe, though not in the same sense for the sub- lunar world as for the superlunar. 2. This is perhaps a minor point and yet it is of interest as showing how undue emphasis and the ambiguity of a strange term may lead to misunder- standing. Baeumker and Mandonnet are agreed that Siger was not an ortho- dox thinker, but the former is unwilling to charge him with any more hetero- doxy than is actually contained in his words. And he seems in the present writer's opinion to be right. Mandonnet is somewhat too severe even on Averroes. The latter often speaks of "Loquentes trium legum," by which are meant the theologians of the three religions, Judaism, Christianity and Mohammedanism. The only objection that a sensitive religionist may have to the phrase is the detached manner in which the three dominant religions seem to be lumped together as being all on the same level. But there is nothing to show that this is more than merely apparent. For the word "Loquentes" is not at all an objectionable term, though it has been mis- understood as equivalent to "garrulantes," "garrulatores" (Mandonnet, Siger I, 148, II, 8), which is absolutely unwarranted. "Loquentes" is a literal translation of the Arabic Mutakallimgn, which is a technical term and denotes a special school of Arabian rationalizing theologians. There is nothing derogatory in the word "Mutakallimfin," which is older than Averroes, and he is of course not responsible for the term Loquentes, which, too, is meant to cover the Arabic term and no more. Averroes never attacks the simple believers, even the learned among them, the Fugaha, who do not meddle with philosophy. He attacks repeatedly the Mutakallimin, particularly in his compendium of the Metaphysics, but solely as philosophers, not as religious believers. Surely no one would think of accusing Maimonides of irreverence, and yet he is quite as severe a critic of the Mutakatlimgn as is Averroes. Both Averroes and Maimonides attack the Mutakallimfin because their methods are not philosophical enough, i. e., not Aristotelian, since they believe in such things as atoms and other impossible theories. It is therefore clear that one may have the greatest respect for religion and yet oppose on scientific grounds the Mutakallimfin. The term "Loquentes" was evidently misunderstood by the author of the anonymous treatise "De Erroribus Philosophorum,'" who thinks it is equivalent to "garrulantes" and "garrulatores," and Man- donnet is guilty of the same error, when he renders it "bavards" (Autour de Siger, p. 44). If Siger is even more careful in his expression than Averroes, there is no reason for accusing him of calling Christian beliefs fables unless he says so expressly, and it is clear, as Baeumker argues, that he does not. 3. Here the question is whether "Quod deum esse sapientibus sit per se notum" is Averroistic or not. Mandonnet said in his book it was, but has now changed his mind in view of Baeumker's correction and goes to the other extreme, saying it is in agreement with the view of Thomas Aquinas. This Baeumker thinks is going too far. The matter turns upon what is meant by</page><page sequence="12">No. 3.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 353 "per se notum." If we just take the phrases it is clear that Thomas Aquinas wQuld not say that the existence of God is "per se notum " even "sapientibus." He makes a distinction between " per se notum simpliciter " and "per se notum quoad nos," and says that the former is true, the latter not. See Summa Contra Gentiles, I, ch. XI, "simpliciter quidem Deum esse per se notum est, quum hoc ipsum quod deus est sit suum esse. Sed quia hoc ipsum quod Deus est mente concipere non possumus, remanet ignotum quoad nos." "Quoad nos" includes 'sapientes' also. By "per se" is meant without the need of demonstration. If, says Thomas, we could without demonstration, but immediately, say by intuition, know the nature of God, we should eo ipso know his existence, because, as we now know by demonstration, his " essentia " is identical with his "esse." But no one, not even the wise, has such an in- tuition of God's nature, hence no one knows his existence except by demon- stration, and the identity of his essence with his existence is also a matter of demonstration. Whether the idea of Siger is exactly the same or not is not clear. To say that after the demonstration of the existence of God Deus est is "per se notum" seems a peculiar use of "per se." 4. Here there seems no doubt that Baeumker's interpretation is correct. When Siger says (II, p. 87): "iudicatur in humanis actibus actus malus non referenda nec attendendo ad totum universum, sed ad ipsam hominum com- munitatem . . " and again (ib., 88) "ratio malitiae in actu humano et ratio punitionis non considerantur attendendo ad totum genus entis, sed ad genus humanum. Et quia sunt actus humani qui, etsi fiant cum bono quorundam entium, redundant tamen in malum commune civitatis vel regni, hinc est quod sunt mali simpliciter humana malitia et prohibendi et puniendi," it is clear that, taken together with the question raised and defended as ex- plained by Baeumker, the contrast is not between the species and the individual within humanity, but between the human species and the rest of nature. "Cum bono quorundam entium," when compared with "totum genus entis," denotes not "certains hommes, " as Mandonnet says (Autour de Siger, 5I), but beings other than men, since "totum genus entis" is contrasted with "genus humanum." Siger would surely have said "quorundam ho- minum" if this is what he meant. If this is true then Siger cannot be held responsible for a proposition like the following which rests upon a distinction not made by Siger: "Quod pec- catum contra naturam, utpote abusus in coitu, licet sit contra naturam speciei, non tamen est contra naturam individui" (II, p. I90, no. 206). Besides if the distinction between the interest of the species and that of the individual could be ascribed to Siger, the proposition just quoted would be prohibited as an evil and a sin, since it is fraught with evil consequences for the species. We may close this notice by saying that though it was unfortunate that a personal attack should have been the immediate occasion of these discussions, the result has been a clarifying of some of the matters in dispute in the doctrine of Siger.
