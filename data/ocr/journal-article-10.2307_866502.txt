The first volume under review contains a learned exposition of the elements of Buddhist iconography, but the facts presented are subordinated to the author's thesis, which is philosophical. The premises adopted are not only frankly personal, but the literary quotations upon which the argument is based are selected eclecti- cally, not critically. Dr. Coomaraswamy feels that mysticism is very much the same all the world over and that, therefore, a knowledge of Christian theology may be used to further an understanding of Indian culture, which is accepted as being essentially religious. Theology, although undoubtedly a science, is dependent upon the written word, since it works from the traditional towards dogma. On the one hand, to be merely religious is no qualification for a theologian while, on the other, theologians can hardly avoid the mode of thought which is called scholastic. The simple fact that certain religious minds have displayed a tendency to confuse the religious uses of iconography with aesthetics, is no proof that religious and aesthetic experience is one and indivisable. In India, religious opinion as represented by certain texts which are later rather than earlier, displays itself as scholastic through and through. This is proved by the important fact that Buddhism resisted the anthro- pomorphic tendencies latent in all iconography for 201</page><page sequence="2">The Literature of Art centuries, only to sublimate metaphysically its forced acquiescence. Conversely, the obvious fact that scholastic theology successfully sublimated on paper the demand for idolatrous iconography forbids one to postulate that this intellectual refinement is essentially Indian. Nothing is clearer than the fact that the Buddha opposed the use of anthropomorphic icons, yet texts exist which attribute the institution of iconography to him. The chronology of the literature is admittedly confused, but there is plenty of internal evidence for criticism to work upon. Moreover, in a modern account of iconography, the theory of symbolism must find a place. Silberer's work, or any general text-book such as Rank and Sachs, makes that clear. The second volume is built on firm ground. It deals with the early sculpture at Bodhgaya and is an important contribution, long overdue. The plates are worthy of the text. The whole provides an excellent introduction, not only to these delightful sculptures but to the facts of early Buddhist iconography. K. DE B. CODRINGTON</page></plain_text>
