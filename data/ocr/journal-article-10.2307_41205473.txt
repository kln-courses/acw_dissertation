<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert Mann SUNY, Binghamton The Malamudian World: Method and Meaning When Ludovico, the insightful pimp of Pictures of Fidelman, advises Fidelman that the "basis of morality is recognizing one another's needs and cooperating,"1, he is expressing in stirring understatement a concept that is at the heart of Malamud's work. Malamud presents us with a world of dismal fact and moral possibility, and whatever is possible hinges on the necessary link between people. Characters may appear in states of isolation but this isolation is always challenged. Men may exist in various sorts of prisons - stifling stores or decaying rooms or self-inflicted prisons of the mind - but there will be an intrusion, at least in Malamud's world, and this intrusion comes to be a representation of hope or failure in life, or frigid reality. Ludovico's words have great meaning, but what is easy to express is not so easy to achieve. Malamud's world is one of continual struggle. Moral struggle is constantly reflected in physical struggle in an intensely physical Malamudian world. There is no way to evade the harshness of life. "It's a hard life" is Malamud's pervasive reminder; "life is hard." Morality is linked to the physical because it is out of the literal physical hardship, struggle, suf- fering, even defeat, that an understanding of man's relation to others evolves. To be truly "human" is to recognize the vulnerability of others, a vulnerability we all share, and to be moved by it. Malamud's characters con- tend with severe limitations, are oppressed by forces beyond their control. Birtthe choice to do good, to respond to the needs of another, becomes an act of freedom and self-redemption. Connection, then, embodies a spiritual potential, and it is played out in a physical world that makes its own de- mands. Even Malamud's use of language displays a highly intense physicality. The Malamud sound involves a vivid concretization of emotional and spiritual states that results in an immediacy of impact: "This thought had lived in him with claws",; "Depression dug a fast hole^and in it he sat drowning"; "Where would he drag that dead cat, his soul?"4"He tried to say</page><page sequence="2">3 some sweet thing but his tongue hung in his mouth like dead fruit on a tree, and his heart was a black-painted window";5 "His blood changed to falling snow/'6 Malamud's metaphors reinforce the physical reality of life. We are made to sensuously apprehend the world in which his people interact. By drawing us so close to the feel and feelings within his world, Malamud lets us experience his characters' struggles and, to the extent that we can, even share these struggles. Through this act, the reader, too, develops a compassion for what is common to the life we live. In "The Last Mohican," Susskind destroys Fidelman's manuscript because the "words were there but the spirit was missing."7 Both are there in Malamud, and we lose the impact when we fail to recognize the struggle. To remain aloof, to casually note the flaws that draw Malamud's people into cycles of pain - flaws that Malamud takes pain to clearly reveal - to too readily feel morally superior, is to dull some of the power that Malamud can have for us. "Life is hard." It is complicated; not everything is clear-cut. Malamud's characters are often asked to do things which are not noticeably simple to accomplish. Ludovico, for instance, despite insight, is a scoundrel who admits to being "given almost exclusively to petty evil" (134), and while Fidelman's nature is warped, Ludovico's ambivalent qualities do much to quell any immediate inclinations to respond humanely. Levin, in A New Life, is not asked to assume responsibility for a lonely, lovely, gentle waif, heart - breakingly in need, but for a dissatisfied, older, already married, pregnant woman with two small children. It is preferable but not always easy to be just, humane, inspiredly human. Ostrovsky the lawyer, in The Fixer, admiringly tells Yakov Bok that "You suffer for us all,"8 but Yakov doesn't suffer for us unless we to some extent suffer with him, make the attempt to understand the depth of his pain even as we recognize the shortcomings that relate to his fate. In The Assistant, Morris says to Frank, "I suffer for you" (150), and when Frank asks him what he means, he says, "I mean you suffer for me" (150). Connections are made on a two-way street. The struggle loses its mean- ing if it fails to illuminate and then solidify the relationships between people. And Malamud's physicality, by establishing the realness of his world, in- tensifies our awareness of the struggles that accompany the triumphs and tragedies of his characters' interaction. Realizing this, we can with greater perspective go on to deal with that world's symbolic nature as well. Open any book by Malamud and you immediately find an environment that is consistently identifiable as the Malmudian world. The conditions of that world, the issues that confront its people, and the images Malamud uses to convey these matters reappear from book to book. There is a careful or- chestration of the recurring motifs that invariably relate to physical and emotional and spiritual connections. Malamud generally avoids tedium not only by juggling the interplay of his recurring motifs but by allowing a motif to expand in possible connotations even as it announces a particular situation to be explored. This is evident, for instance in Malamud's use of movement. Movement, in general, reflects Malamud's steadfast concern with man's relationship to others, to his world. Man's aspirations, his yearnings, also his hubris, are repeatedly expressed in terms of movement. The action or situation of flight, both flying and fleeing, is endowed by Malamud with varied suggestiveness. Images of rising and falling capture man's longings as</page><page sequence="3">4 well as his limitations and recur constantly in Malamud, operating as in- sistent indicators of struggle. Man, attempting to ascend, is plucked from the sky, forced to obey the law of gravity. He assumes his proper place in the scheme of things and is given the chance to note his connections to his surroundings. The physical laws of life and death are inescapable; man is cut down, but the possibility of moral ascension* exists, and this relates to his ties to others. The law of gravity finds its balance in the "Law" (150), as Morris Bober explains it, that instructs us "to do what is right, to be honest, to be good" (150). To cooperate, as Ludovico's version would have it. The struggle toward insight, in physical terms, is an upward climb that broadens, not contradicts, the notion of failed flight. Malamud doesn't let us forget that Moses climbed Mount Sinai to receive the Law.10 You don't ex- pect to find a Malamud character inhabiting the first floor. People inevitably "climb" up to rooms or apartments, and Malamud consciously chooses to portray the physical exertion. Top floor dwellings appear frequently in his work; Malamud is not above being playful with his applications ofthat fact. While we witness more or less conventional climbs to top floors of tenements in "The Mourners" or The Tenants, in "In Retirement" the struggle is ad- justed to the nature of a tall apartment building, and accordingly the elevator must ascend a steep fifteen floors, this also highlighting the issue of resurrec- tion of desire in the aging Dr. Morris. In "The Jewbird," Schwartz may fly his way into the Cohens' life, but they nevertheless live in a "top floor apart- ment"; that it's a long drop for a needy soul is highly significant to the story. Schwartz, though he makes a deep impression, is one of many birds and bird images employed by Malamud. Birds, the physical embodiment of flight, offer images of possibility but also pictures of despair, entrapment. The Panessas, buried in their basement store as business goes bad, and betrayed by Willy Schlegel, in "The Bill," "appeared to be two scrawny, loose-feathered birds" (132), unable to take off. Often, Malamud's women are described as vulnerable birds, their struggle to fly off, to improve their lot, connecting them to many male protagonists. Canaries make fleeting ap- pearances in such works as The Natural and The Tenants, and operate as a warning that what seems to be good fortune isn't. If Malamud's cast often resemble unfortunate fowl, their movements also parallel fish. Not- surprisingly, the Malamudian fish is the salmon, since it illustrates the struggle upward by swimming upstream. But the slimy, slippery quality of fish is applied to characters living in selfish comfort, having managed to slide through difficult times. In physical terms, sliminess quite literally impedes the possibility of connection. The act of running is another essential aspect of movement in Malamud. Many of his characters are "refugees." By definition they must run, and at- tention must be paid (though in "The German Refugee" we are made aware that such running carries its own responsibilities too). But several other characters become self-made refugees, adrift, essentially homeless - or morally lost - requiring a meaningful anchor. So often, the underlying but unperceived need to be part of something, to relate to one's people, one's past, is suggested by an opposite impulse - wandering, traveling, fleeing. Running becomes the desperate parallel to imprisonment; both are images of</page><page sequence="4">5 Separation and spiritual unachievement. Abramowitz, denied knowledge and freedom, yearning to know what he is, who he is, provides an apt image when he "gallops in his stall" 12 in "Talking Horse," while in Pictures ofFidelman, Beppo, in homosexual heat, literally mounts Fidelman, that act ultimately a symbolic attempt to control Fidelman's endless hurrying, and Fidelman,find- ing love, stops running, at least for a while. When it occurs, successful con- nection, an embracing of one kind or another, happily combines the limiting of physical movement with the potentially freeing power of moral insight. If stores are tombs and cells constricting, wider spaces may promise just as little. The image of the circle conveniently connects ineffective running with stifling imprisonment. Characters moving in circles are trapped. Birds, too, are sometimes pictured running in circles, a comment on the conditions of the protagonists. The circle, a frequent Malamudian image, is the shape of desperate motion time and time again. Frank Alpine, in The Assistant, faces his face: "Where have you ever been, he asked the one in the glass, except on the inside of a circle?" (211) Bok, in The Fixer, paces his prison cell in "cir- cular entrapment" (151), though at one point a centipede ironically foots it out with ease. Levin, in A New Life, exhorts himself to "keep the circle broken" (57). The seasons become a troubling cycle because the promise of change is constant but so is its temporary nature. The circle is also used as a significant reminder that the past and present are united, and the image of Roy Hobbs circling the bases toward home plate, in The Natural, is devastating in its meanings and ironies. Time, especially the relationship of the past to the present, is another recurring Malamudian concern, and it takes on a physical quality that links it to movement. The past weighs down on characters, often in opposition to their attempts at flight. The burden of time and its sense of heaviness is ever- present, whether it involves Morris Bober, dreading the "deadweight of hours" (91), or Harry Lesser, working long years on a book, in The Tenants, where "time adds time to each word; they weigh like rocks, the weight of waiting for the end . . . "13 Wait equals weight in Malamud, although time also stuns characters with its uncomfortable speed. For Levin, in A New Life, "Each day his past weighed more" (118), but time also "moved on relentless roller skates" (118). Time is the mobile weight that continues to bear down on Malamud's people until they come to grips with their past. The compulsion to escape the past is irrevocably entwined with the need to make sense of it, and it is the failure to learn from past experience and to understand how the past relates to the present that accounts for the cyclical history of a given Malamud protagonist, that leads to a life where the past is repeated. A Malamud character might seek a new life, but the new life that is sought inevitably is connected to the old life never quite left behind because it cannot be shed. The past is part of the present, but if it is incorporated wisely into one's experience, one's life may then take on a new direction. Invariably, the insightful descent into the past holds the possibilities for a better, uplifting future. However, there is also a something-lost-in-the-past syndrome that af- flicts Malamud's characters, a need not satisfied, and while it of course proceeds from the past, it leaves them adrift in the present. This lack of fulfillment, which seems to forestall direction in their lives, relates to the ab-</page><page sequence="5">6 sence or loss of parents. The heroes of Malamud's novels are either orphaned or long out of touch with a surviving parent. Cut off from their origins, from a family's love, they require a connection. Unresolved attitudes toward their beginnings result in a sense of restless wandering where the failure and pain ot the past are repeated. The lack of guidance and encouragement adds to the difficulty of achieving needed connection and leads to intensified struggles. And when the pressures of the past aren't being felt, Malamud's characters may be assaulted by an interminable, unrelieved present. En- trapment, frustration, the sense of wasted years are conveyed by a tense present tense. "She runs up to her babies in the nursery"14 is the closing reminder of Karla's desperation in "Notes from a Lady at a Dinner Party." "Oskar Gassner sits"15 introduces "The German Refugee," his pain unrelieved by the passage of time. "He waits" (178) sounds the seemingly en- less trials of Yakov Bok. Such a present tense becomes an especially suc- cinct summary, a caption accompanying images of despair. Just as connection, the connection of people to each other, to their en- vironment, to their past, is a major concern of Malamud's, Malamud fre- quently calls upon the senses that connect us to the world to act as important motifs. Sight, smell, hearing (sound), touch, taste (hunger), all become sig- nificant aspects of Malamud's world. Sight, for instance, as a function of connection, is inevitably involved in the struggle to connect. One's gaze interlocks with another's or else one averts the eyes, but in either case the act introduces the issue of the interrelationship of people. When a Malamud character looks at another, often he is seeing himself, or else viewing a quality in that person that importantly concerns himself. Once a connection is established, and it is generally a tenuous, uncomfortable connection, an inevitable Malamudian pattern unfolds which involves a reversing of roles, a crisscrossing of experience, and a merging of identities in which a Malamud character has the opportunity to feel what another has felt, to see what another has seen, and this experience may lead to insight. Sight becomes insight, the eyes become part of a process that results in improved perception or that demonstrates pathetic failure, if moral blindness endures. Images of light and dark play against each other,16 the imprisoning darkness of a room, a cell, a soul, in conflict with the hopeful possibilities of bright- ness. The battle toward light, physically, parallels the struggle toward insight, morally. The sense of such a struggle, evident so often in Malamud's stories of desperate movement, intense journeying, is suggested in A New Life: "In a tenement, each descent to the street was an expedition through dank caves and dreary tunnels" (56), such tunnels reminding us of the "long dark tunnel" (3) that is a grocery in The Assistant, or the ballpark and train tunnels of The Natural, where the darkness is deadening but conceivably transcended through insight. Eyes, themselves, are very visible in Malamud's works, where there is a plethora of sad eyes. Eyes express the depth of suffering and feeling, the needs of an individual, and this becomes the basis for connection. Eyes often reflect on character or reveal inadequacies of the spirit, although Cronin's "sensitive eyes"17 in "A Choice of Profession" are misleading. Malamud's characters contend with problems of identity and often struggle to achieve a definable personality, the frequent description of eyes calling attention to this</page><page sequence="6">7 condition, especially in The Fixer. On occasion, women characters such as Isabella in "The Lady of the Lake," and other ladies of the lake, Iris of The Natural and Mary Lou of "A Choice of Profession" (Pauline Gilley, photographed naked, in A New Life, and Helen Bober, undressed, in The Assistant, are parallels), bare their bodies,18 an act more indicative of their attempts to bare their souls, and what the involved male character sees helps define his limitations. Dreams are another manifestation of sight and insight, and frequently appear in Malamud. Often, they are infused with the particular imagery of the work, and Malamud likes to use dreams as a means of encapsulating, summarizing his characters' conditions. Dreams (and this extends to reveries, intuitive imaginings, visions) express the inevitable in- terrelationships of characters, very dramatically in The Tenants, for instance, where they record the progressive and tragic interlocking of Harry and Willie's destinies. In The Assistant, they express Frank's frustrated attempts to establish a connection. Dreams may be false forecasts, as in "Behold the Key," or solemn foreshadowings, as in The Natural, or "The German Refugee." They also appear as triumphant insights, the groundwork for such flashes of recognition being laid by the earlier symbolic events of the story. Truth is revealed to Fidelman in his sleep in "The Last Mohican," Fidelman finally understanding how he failed to see Giotto's painting, failed to perceive its essential, purposeful, humanity'. Manischevitz, in "Angel Levine," through a dream sees Alexander Levine in a different light and rediscovers the faith that leads to a redeeming connection of man and angel. Letters, like dreams, also relate to the issue of sight and the struggle to connect. Again, they appear throughout Malamud, including a bundle of them in Malamud's latest collection of short stories, Rembrandt's Hat. Let- ters represent the urgent effort on the part of one character to open the eyes of another, to establish a meaningful connection. They seem a natural motif for a communicative writer like Malamud, whose books might be seen, in the best sense, as artful letters to the world, containing insights, suggestions, as to how one might live life better. The writing of letters, or notes, are at once hopeful and desperate acts of communication in such stories as "The Prison," "The German Refugee," and "Notes from a Lady at a Dinner Par- ty." Roy's reluctance to read Iris Lemon's letter, in The Natural, is an in- dication of his capitulation to a world of darkness and moral blindness. Lesser's smashed mailbox says something about his state of isolation in The Tenants. Dr. Morris, of "In Retirement," and Leo, in "My Son the Mur- derer," are driven to secretly open letters in their poignant attempts to gain understanding of the people they want to reach. And what Newman "sees" in Teddy's letter - a blank page - in "The Letter," suggests his lack of interest in reaching anyone. The sense of touch has an obvious relevance to both successful and failed connections in Malamud, physical embrace being the most direct image of union. When Malamud portrays Morris dreaming of wrestling with Frank, in The Assistant, or when Levin, in A New Life, dreams of wrestling with Duffy, the physical struggle demonstrates the crucial mingling of the similarly difficult lives of related characters; it also points to a character's struggle toward an understanding of how the lives of others relate to his own.</page><page sequence="7">8 The experience of an individual is purposefully inflicted upon that of another, and the eventual physical clash, and the intensity ofthat event, may finalize the meaning of the interrelationship and lead to a burst of insight, as in the struggle between Mendel and Ginzburg in "Idiots First." On the other hand, Lesser and Spearmint's bloody confrontations, both real and foredoomed, in The Tenants, express the tragic failure of their connected lives, violence being the image of failed connections. The failure of characters to achieve insight into what should be the shared responsibilities of interact- ing people often results in some form of physical punishment, whether it is Schneider, of "Behold the Key," receiving a key thrown at his forehead, Cohen of "The Jewbird," having his nose bitten, or Fidelman, of "A Pimp's Revenge" in Pictures of Fidelman, submitting to his own suicidal thrust of the blade. Likewise, the various sexual unions in Malamud's works, with their varying degrees of success, including levels of emotional and physical pain, comment on the quality or limitations of those commingling characters' connections. The sense of touch is unmistakably sensitive to the weather, and Malamud consistently employs descriptions of the weather to indicate not only physical conditions but spiritual states. His characters suffer from the extremes of temperature, especially the cold, and this should create at least a sensuous awareness of snared vulnerability. Physical embrace literally coun- teracts the effects of the cold, symbolically suggesting the immediate value of connection. The cold often refers to the spirit of a character to the lack of human warmth that hinders any kind of connection but that also makes con- nection necessary. Mitka, in "The Girl of My Dreams," passes from a wintry state of the soul to an embracing of spring when he finally allows the self- created barries of his isolation to be penetrated. In "The Maid's Shoes," Krantz fires Rosa, despite her pleading, but the experience leaves him feeling cold, the resistance to cold certainly weakened by the condition of a man's emotions. The willingness to charitably part with one's coat or suit makesfor significant moments in such stories as "The Bill," "The Last Mohican," and "Idiots First," for that act counteracts the literal and figurative coldness of life that results when a man denies himself his humanity. The nature of the cold may change, however, if a man's capacity to respond to others is rekin- dled. The snow, for instance, can be a harsh image, reminding us of the pain in life, as in "In Retirement," where, like white fragments of a shredded let- ter, snow is the image of the cold whiteness of age, the relentless downpour of time that shatters the hope for connection, but snow acquires a benign sense of softness at the end of "Angel Levine" when we witness how hardship becomes the basis for understanding and union. In Malamud, a balance is struck between the triumphs that take place in the cold and the snow that onimously falls in the spring. Malamud's weather is a personalized weather, often suited to the conditions of a character's existence, as indicated by Albert Gans' thoughts in "The Silver Crown": "Maybe my subconscious is telling me to go along with a blowing wind and have the crown made. After that we'll see what happens - whether it rains, snows, or spring comes."19 The sensuousness of Malamud's world, as it relates to connection, also involves the sense of hearing, smell, and, through various aspects of hunger taste. The aural dimension of Malamud's world, if not awesome, is apparent.</page><page sequence="8">9 The clamor of the tenements, the screams of unappealing, unsympathetic wives, add to or else convey the burdens that weigh on some of Malamud's protagonists, and Sobel's "pounding leather for his love" (18) is central to the effect of "The First Seven Years," as is the roar of thunder to that of The Natural but the sound that echoes throughout Malamud is the sound of knocking. Malamud consistently describes the act of knocking, or Rosa's timid tapping in "The Maid's Shoes." The knock is the insistent sound that announces the struggle to connect, that alerts us to the drama of interacting individuals. It accompanies the inevitable intrusion into isolation, often signalling us to the needs of one character and the flaws of the other. One might simply say that knocking expresses the need to connect, although that need is not always recognized or fulfilled by Malamud's frequently un- cooperative creations.21 The ringing and knocking of The Tenants give way to the sorrowful final cries of Levenspiel; Cesare knocks at Etta's door in "Life is Better than Death," knocking up Etta in the process, but finally abandons her; Leo knocks on his son's door to no avail, in "My Son the Murderer." Generally, the intruder knocks and disrupts the isolation of another, and each may influence the other, sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad (sometimes both), sometimes hardly at all, but the results ofthat announced entry becomes the substance of the particular work. Hunger, manifested in a variety of ways, is another prevalent condition in Malamud's world. When a Malamudian character has not fulfilled him- self, his stomach rarely seems filled; Roy Hobbs' incredible and insatiable appetite, in The Natural is an especially vivid example. Hunger also is reflec- ted in the goodly number of meagerly fleshed characters that people Malamud's books. The skeletal image becomes a representation of need and vulnerability that might be counteracted by a rehabilitating response, a com- passionate connection, and, especially when paired with cemeteries and graveyards, points to the past's presence in the present. But Malamud's skeletons not only lack food, sometimes they lack humanity as well, and thus such physical frailty actually represents spiritual deficiency. In either case there is a sense of incompleteness; someone or something added to the skeleton, connected to it, provides the possibility of a hopeful transformation. In a similar way, "hungry eyes" often display the need for connection, but at other times express pure greed, the perversion of appetite. Obesity, as an ex- tension of voracious eyes and popeyes, often is a negative sign; it is con- nection's enemy. The bloated quality of a charcter suggests the distortion of sensibility, an abnormal involvement with the self, for the fat self frequently expands to the detriment of others, the fat Karp of The Assistant being a good illustration. Excessively comfortable, fat people weigh down on Malamud's less fortunate characters, although, as indicated before, the ex- cessive thinness of a character, like Max in "The First Seven Years," points to spiritual inadequacy. Desire, too, as a sympathetic form of hunger and need, when transformed into lust, forecasts the failure of any impending act of connection. Just as extremism of appetite represents a bloated impediment to con- nection, odors in Malamud signify the fouling up of connections, and are of- ten used as part of Malamud's sensuous indications of his characters' con- ditions. Men of questionable moral integrity may exude fishy odors. Tommy</page><page sequence="9">10 Castelli, mourning the passing of years, in "The Prison," resents the stench of time. In The Natural the fat Judge Banner smokes a smelly cigar that sends out blinding waves of smoke, as Malamud, in a not uncommon prac- tice, interweaves his sense motifs. In The Fixer, Yakov Bok bitterly retreats from the ghetto with its stifling smell, but Bibikov redirects his awareness to the more threatening odor (as the literal and figurative alternate) of Russian fragrant Helen. Smells, pleasant and more often awful, permeate The Tenants, contrasting unreal reveries with the nightmarish realities of Lesser's life, and commenting on the ruinous Lesser- Spearmint connection.22 The sense of smell, as all other senses, is used by Malamud to create a rich and accessible world, but as an added benefit, he endows that very sensuousness with a symbolic quality that is smoothly integrated into his theme of connec- tion. When one considers such works as "Angel Levine," or "Take Pity," or The Natural or "The Jewbird," or Idiots First," one might be tempted to point out that the elements of fantasy, fable, and the supernatural add a completely different dimension to Malamud's otherwise sensuously realistic frame of reference. Actually, these elements effectively operate as merely varied expressions of Malamud's consistent concerns. Malamud's fabulous world belongs to his realer world, and these stories don't read appreciably differently than his older stories; in certain works he exercises his imagination differently, perhaps more freely, but it is the relationship of being to being - whether man, animal, or supernatural entity - in a less than cozy environment that remains the primary Malamudian issue. The fact that Alexander Levine is an angel is far less important than the fact that he, it, is redeemed through Manischevitz's act of faith, Manischevitz's willingness to believe. What becomes magical is man's capacity to believe in others, given the conditions of life. Roy Hobbs hits a legendary home run that only rises into the stands after it has passed between the legs of an opposing player, but that magic is made possible by the rising Iris' expression of belief in Hobbs, as miracle and feeling are connected. Even in The Assistant, Helen "had recently come to think that in such unhappy times ... to find love was miraculous" (160). Shmuel says to Yakov Bok, the fixer, whose disbelief in God goes hand in hand with his alienation from his people and the world, that the "true miracle is belief (211), and Shmuel translates this belief into human charity. And what is magical about "The Magic Barrel" is man's capacity to change, to see, to truly connect, Salz- man's profession as matchmaker expressing the need of people to connect, even as he represents a corruption of that need. But the magic barrel is not the magic, the conceivable transformation of people is. Feelings, then, are transcendent; the expression of love and comradeship is magical in its power to give life a sense of meaning. "The Silver Crown" deals more than anything else with the surrender to death, the silver crown no more magical (nor no less) than a burning belief in life and an intense capapcity to love. Malamud doesn't take his eyes off what is real and what is possible. What is possible is real, and fable and fantasy remain subordinate to the at once real and tran- scendent issue of moral possibility. In fact, Malamud's own matter-of-fact treatment of the supernatural suggests that we must turn our attention to the matters of fact - to love as miracle, belief as miracle, man's greatest capacity</page><page sequence="10">11 to do good as miracle. To change evil into goodness is the magical act that redeems. And connection, counteracting morally disabling isolation, creates the possibility ofthat transformation. It is evident that Malamud's world is a painful world and that suffering appears as a basic condition. However, Malamud does not delight in suf- fering, he doesn't endorse it, he does not suggest that we seek pain or that we must live to suffer. Suffering does become part of a meaningful process, but only after Malamud has established it as an inevitable condition. The fact is that suffering is unavoidable, and Malamud confronts its inevitability. If he makes any demand, it is that we must learn from our suffering; we must allow our suffering to give us insight that leads to compassion. Not to learn is tantamount to sin in Malamud, and when Yakov Bok says that "it takes me a long time to learn" (234), he speaks for many of Malamud's characters, who continue to suffer most intensely when they fail to learn from their painful ex- periences. This lends ironic force to Malamud's use of teachers and students as protagonists in several of his works. Likewise, in Malamud's world, any achievement necessitates struggle, and when a character like Roy Hobbs, looking forward to a free meal, feels "in a mood for something for nothing" (93), or Levin, exulting over the west's natural beauty in A New Life, thinks, "Imagine getting this for nothing" (24), we can expect trouble ahead. But the Malamudian world is hardly devoid of hope. A Malamudian man shouldn't count his chickens - they're scraggly enough - but he might as well be prepared for anything. Malamud starts with the street, the cold, the wind, the stench, the prison, and out of this he fashions an occasional triumph of the human spirit. The essence of the soul is not too far removed from the smell of the streets. Out of shattering reality he struggles to create possibility. Out of poignant defeat and limitation comes a connection of men, a shared vulnerability that instigates a moral vision. This moral vision becomes the human struggle to accept life, to affirm it, and the struggle is constant. Notes: 1 Pictures ofFidelman (New York: Dell Publishing Co.. 1 970). 105.

Eigner, in "The Loathly Ladies," the Fields eds., Bernard Malamud and the Critics. 85-107, discusses the ladies of the lake. 19 "The Silver Crown," Rembrandt's Hat, 24. 20 "Man in the Drawer," Rembrandt's Hat, 73. 21 Herbert Leibowitz, reviewing Idiots First, makes reference to locked doors, a parallel situation, in "Malamud and the Anthropomorphic Business," The New Republic, 149:25 (December 21, 1963), 21-23. 22 John Alexander Allen, in "The Promised End: Bernard Malamud's The Tenants," the Fields, eds., Bernard Malamud: A Collection of Critical Essays, 115-116, makes a similar point and employs the same quotation I used from The Fixer to buttress his discussion.</page></plain_text>
