<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narratology, Narrative, and Meaning Gerald Prince Romance Languages, Pennsylvania What I intend to do, in the main, is to retrace a journey, but first I will mention an old joke-that of the madman reading the telephone directory and thinking that it is a rather mediocre novel: too many characters and too little action. If I find it relatively easy to read the directory as a novel (and a set of directories as a saga), I find it more difficult to use a novel as a directory. But not impossible: a code would suffice. Narratology-at least in its classical period-practically never pon- ders the alethic potential of narrative, the relations of the narrative text with truth or falsehood, the nature of the fictional as opposed to the real, the being of narratively represented worlds. The great narratologists of the sixties-Barthes (1966), Bremond (1964, 1966), Greimas (1966), or Todorov (1969, 1970)-study, of course, the nar- rated rather than the narrating, story rather than discourse, and they generally do it on the basis of fictional texts, but without showing con- cern for ontology, veracity, or narrative context. They want, above all, to isolate and describe the fundamental elements of the narrated and their possible combinations. Structures, logics, grammars occupy a place of honor and not what pertains to the more or less success- ful imitation of some universe, to the quality of existents and events, to problems of reference and referents. When Genette (1972) de- fines narrative in terms of mode (a narrator relates) rather than ob- An earlier French version of this paper was presented at the 1989 Cerisy collo- quium on fictionality.

As for those who, loyal to Barthes's ideal and example in the famous "Introduction a l'analyse structurale des recits," attempt to combine the study of discourse and story, try to effect a synthesis, they do not worry about connecting the form or the functioning of narrative to the being of its components or to their referential objective (cf. Mathieu-Colas 1986 and Prince [forthcoming]). No doubt, many "classical" narratologists examine domains which, by their configuration, their elements, or their import, often lead to correlations with what is or what could be. But, strictly speaking, they do not do it as narratologists. Besides, their approach and conclusions emphasize the structural aspects and the textuality of these domains. Realism is a function of a (discursive) reality effect and not of some adequacy to reality; verisimilitude is defined in terms of a textual net- work; the fantastic emerges in the text at the confluence of narrative motivations which are equally possible but contradictory (see, e.g., Barthes 1968; Todorov 1970). No doubt, also, certain "classical" narratological principles and dem- onstrations are imbued with empiricism: for instance, the rule accord- ing to which the basic temporal order of a narrative sequence is always chronological, but is capable of being altered by successive transforma- tions. It is easy to show that this rule draws its inspiration more from a mimetic conception of narrative, from verisimilitude, from experi- ence, than from theoretical imperatives: after all, at least in the case of many fictional narratives, there exists no chronological sequence of events which can be said to precede its anachronous representation. Similarly, certain canonical narrative tempos-summary, for example, or stretch-are often calculated in terms of either our experience or our view of the real world (rather than in terms of the narrative itself and in relation to other tempos in it). Suppose I read, "Peter boxed remarkably for fifteen rounds." I could speak of summary: I know that a much more detailed description of the fight could have been provided (and I feel that it could have been interesting). Conversely, suppose I read about a hundred pages which depict Peter's drinking a cup of coffee. I could speak of stretch: I know that this action could have been presented in a few lines (and I feel that it should have been). In other words, when I speak of summary or stretch, I am not necessarily evoking the relation between textual segment and dura- tion of the narrated, but rather, the relation between this segment and what it could have or should have been (in view of my knowledge and my feelings). Finally, certain statements on narrativity and its sources (I am thinking of Barthes's comments about the confusion between</page><page sequence="3">Prince * Narratology and Meaning 545 post hoc and propter hoc, i.e., between the temporal and the causal) de- pend more or less directly on contextual information and knowledge of the real world. Of course, it would be relatively easy to eliminate these theoretical impurities, to overcome these theoretical weaknesses. Thus, one could make the rule of temporal arrangement-chrono- logical or otherwise-optional (this would account, moreover, for texts like LaJalousie, which resist any temporal ordering); one could calcu- late narrative speed in a more strictly textual manner (through inter- nal comparison-and grosso modo-since many texts patiently establish a temporal knowledge); and one could express Barthes's (and Aris- totle's!) insight in terms of discourse pragmatics and not in terms of life experience. In other words, though narratological practice sometimes contradicts narratological claims and aspirations, the contradictions are not inevitable. Be that as it may, the explicit lack of interest on the part of classi- cal narratology for problems relating to the veracity of narrative, the status of its elements, or the importance of its hors-texte is undeniable. It can be criticized, and it has been. But what must be acknowledged is that, if this lack of interest is explained in part by the formalo- structuralist sources and convictions of the discipline and, more spe- cifically, by an exacerbated textocentrism, it is explained as well by the ambitions of narratology and by the very object which it studies. Nar- ratology, as is well known, attempts to define the nature of narrative, its specificity, and to characterize the forms which it may take. Now, fiction-to pick just this example and if one understands by the term any signifying structure, the meaning and force of which are based on a feigned context and/or on events and beings that have never had any empirical existence-fiction is not always narrative; it is not always a representation of one or several events. Any grammatical ex- ample ("John is small and Mary is big"), any mathematical textbook exercise, any lyrical outburst is neither less fictional than Don Quixote or L'Etranger nor more narrative than a syllogism or a lexical defini- tion. On the other hand, narrative accommodates the real as well as the fictional, lying and error as well as truth. It even delights in com- bining them, as evidenced by its first known Western manifestations, the two meanings of the term "history," the gnomic passages and true assertions which abound in certain realistic works, the mixed proposi- tions which unite the fictional and the real (Mr. Pickwick and London, Julien Sorel and Paris), or the multiplicity of narrative genres which lie somewhere between factual record and fabulous account (histori- cal novel, roman a clef, nonfiction novel, fictionalized history, new journalism, and so on). Of course, there are many reasons for which it is not immaterial to distinguish the fictional from the real, hallucination from percep-</page><page sequence="4">546 Poetics Today 12:3 tion, lying from truth. Hence the joke about the telephone directory. For the historian, say, for the metaphysician or the philosopher in love with truth, for the psychologist too and for the critic, and, clearly, for human beings in their daily lives, the distinction entails important consequences. But for the narratologist (who would like, above all, to characterize the differentia specifica of narrative),just as for the linguist, the relevance of this distinction is not self-evident. An objection may be raised that, if there are no grammatical dif- ferences between-say-true assertion and feigned assertion, there are significant dissimilarities between historical narrative and fictional narrative. I am not thinking here of those which bring into play ques- tions of incompleteness or inconsistency. On the one hand, indeed, incompleteness is not a necessary feature of fiction: as Heintz (1979: 91) has observed, taking up Dudley Shapere's suggestion, "It might be possible to so write a story that every statement about its characters would be decided. For example, one might write 'and everything not explicitly stated or implied here is false.'" On the other hand-and I will not invoke nuclear physics!-the completeness of the real world ultimately depends on a sort of fiction, the fiction of "in principle": it is in principle (but only in principle) possible to establish whether Cleopatra's nose was two centimeters long or not, or whether on Sep- tember 24, 1782, Robespierre ate chicken or beef. The same kind of argument applies to consistency; for it is indubitable that certain fictional worlds (say, that of "Little Red Riding Hood") are perfectly consistent, while it is not certain that our real world is. No, I am think- ing of more formal differences, of textual elements or configurations whose presence or absence would indicate the fictitious or truthful nature of a narrative: introductory formulas like "once upon a time" or "there was a place"; inside views and access to the subjectivity of the other (Louis XIII, Richelieu, Anne dAutriche, or dArtagnan); concur- rences of past tenses and spatial or temporal deictics ("now, he did not sound very enthusiastic about it"); pronouns without textual anteced- ents ("she was a remarkable person"); or even paratexts specifying that the text is a work of fiction or history, a biography or a novel. But, how- ever interesting they may be, these differences are local rather than universal. In the first place, the statements and configurations through which fiction can be signaled vary considerably, and one may find-or invent!-fictional works in which they do not appear. Besides, they are never quite conclusive even if their presence constitutes or contributes to a "fiction effect." I could, after all, begin a biography of Napoleon or Richelieu (entirely consonant with the truth and written for chil- dren or intended to highlight the legendary nature of the characters) with "once upon a time"; I occasionally hear-and I myself sometimes use-past tenses accompanied by deictics in a truthful discourse; I do</page><page sequence="5">Prince * Narratology and Meaning 547 not always frame my descriptions of what a third person must have thought with a cautious vocabulary (e.g., "doubtless," "probably," "I suppose," "I imagine"); and, to report news, I sometimes rely on pro- nouns without antecedents ("He lost!"; "She said 'no!'"). The force of these signaling elements is simply not determinative. Some narratives lose their veracity, others gain documentary value, and, like the mad- man in the joke, I can learn French history in Alexandre Dumas or I can read Michelet as a novel. In short (and, mutatis mutandis, the same is true of any human semiotic instrument), there is no algorithm which, on the basis of textual factors, enables one to differentiate, in a narrative corpus, fiction from truth, error, or lying. The forms of narrative, its possibilities, are neither governed by its relationship to the real nor do they indicate it. Nonetheless, the fact remains that the narratologist cannot entirely ignore the problem of truth, even if the manner in which this problem arises is not specific to the narrative domain (but then, narratology is not interested solely in the differentiae specificae of its object: character, description, and focalization are not distinctive features of narrative). Once again, it is the ambitions of the discipline and the logic of its de- velopment which require the problem to be considered. If it is correct to say that narratology attempts to isolate the principles governing the production of any narrative, it is also correct to note that-like any undertaking of structuralist origin-narratology tries to specify the conditions for intelligibility of narrative, that is, what enables it to make sense (I am thinking of Greimas [1966] and [1970], the titles of which are more than revealing; Todorov [1969]; Barthes [1966]). It is un- questionable that, in its classical period, because of its textocentrism, because of the influence exerted by structural and even generative linguistics, because, too, of the temptation of the scientific and the dif- ficulty of formally mastering the semantic, narratology mainly studies narrative syntax and narrative discourse, achieving its most striking results in these areas. But for more than a dozen years already, and thanks to such works as Dolezel (1976, 1980, 1988), Pavel (1980, 1988), and Ryan (1980, 1985), narrative semantics has been proving to be a particularly fertile and promising subject. As these works emphasize, narrative intelligibility is based upon the relationships, in the narra- tive universe, between a world designated as real-what is, what was, what will be, what could be-and more or less adequate representa- tions, perceptions, and notions of that world. I think it goes without saying that these relationships are explicitly and elaborately thema- tized in many narratives, whether fictional or veracious, scientific or fantastic, Don Quixote, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Madame Bovary, as well as this autobiography or that one, this or that reconstruction of what Robespierre believed or what Napoleon hoped for, this or that</page><page sequence="6">548 Poetics Today 12:3 report on what a chemical experiment was to establish. On one hand, existence and its possibilities, the known, the certain, the (potential) truth; on the other hand, fiction, delirium, (partial) ignorance, the uncertain, (more or less serious) errors, falsehoods, lies. To explain what governs the production of meaning in narrative, the narratologist must therefore establish a map of the worlds making up the narrative universe (what Ryan [1985] calls the modal structure of that universe). But s/he must also, and perhaps above all, describe the conventions or devices which allow for the specification of the alethic value-the truth coefficient-of these worlds. Now, as Doleiel (1980, 1988) has pointed out, the propositions composing a narrative and its worlds can be distinguished on the basis of their origin (as signified by the text). There are, on the one hand, those which the narrator expresses: they present or report certain states of affairs and certain series of events in a certain world (the diegesis); they comment on them (indicating their probability, explaining their causes, evaluating their import, comparing them to other possible or impossible states of affairs or series of events); or they comment on the presentation itself and its context. On the other hand, there are the propositions which a character in the diegesis formulates and which also can refer to that diegesis: clarify it, comment on it, or remark on its presenta- tion. In terms of the narrative, and barring any textual indication to the contrary, the world described by the narrator constitutes the world as it is, whatever its correspondence to our own world (or the way we imagine it) may happen to be. If, for example, the narrator declares that Cerisy is the capital of France, that Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo, that the Soviets have been occupying North America for many years, that Don Juan is chaste, or that Ulysses is naive, each one of these declarations represents a fact in the narrative universe, if not in our own. Note that their truth does not necessarily depend on the (homo- or hetero-) diegetic status of the narrator. What Philip Mar- lowe and Mike Hammer say of the environment in which they move about and of their adventures in that environment, what the homo- diegetic and omniscient narrator of Giraudoux's Bella reports is no less true (in terms of the relevant world) than the declarations of the heterodiegetic narrator in Le Pere Goriot or those of the BBC on the results at Wimbledon. Similarly, incoherent commentaries expressed by the narrating voice, as well as deceptive or erroneous explanations and illogical conclusions (according to the text itself), do not always call into question the veracity of the propositions which present the diegesis. They cast doubt on the interpretive powers of the narrator; they do not necessarily deprive him or her of other powers. In Jim Thompson's Killer Inside Me, for instance, Lou Ford is a psychopath,</page><page sequence="7">Prince * Narratology and Meaning 549 but the geographical information he gives us about Central City is no less true; and if the barber in "Haircut" is blind, the fact remains that Jim Kendall was indeed killed by Paul Dickson. On the contrary, a narrator's (repeated) hesitations concerning what is, confessions of ignorance regarding ontic matters, presentations of existents or events according to a point of view designated as (suspiciously) subjective, all weaken his or her authority, his or her ability at authentication (in Dolezel's terms), and call into question the truth of the propositions composing the diegesis (and, a fortiori, the comments pertaining to them). In this case, which should, of course, be empirically tested, it appears that the chronological order of situations and events is more easily cast into doubt than their occurrence, that the latter is ques- tioned sooner than the identity of the existents involved in them, and that the identity of the existents is more readily doubted than their nature. As for the propositions formulated by the characters, their truth co- efficient depends above all on their conformity to what is established by a reliable narrating voice. But it can also depend on what this voice says explicitly about them, or on the reliability of the characters them- selves. In other words, however accurate these propositions may be in our world ("Paris is the capital of France," "Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo," "Ulysses was very cunning"), they are true, textually speaking, only if they do not involve any contradiction to the state- ments of the reliable narrator, if they are not designated by him or her as suspect, untrue, or fictitious, and if their source proves generally trustworthy. Obviously, the situation can often be more complex. One frequently finds in a narrative several narrators and many characters. One can even find more than one diegesis, each representing a distinct factual world (as happens in certain science fiction works, for example). But one may also, on the contrary, be unable to discern any such factual world so that any certainty as to what is, what has been, or what could be proves impossible. Thus, in some postmodern works, the veracity of everything that is presented-through a narrator or a character- is called into question; in other narratives, it is impossible to estab- lish the source of the propositions or to distinguish the points of view adopted; and in others still (I am thinking of LaJalousie), it is difficult even to speak of diegesis. Moreover, it is not simply a matter of setting up distinctions between the different narrators, characters, and diegeses according to their au- thority, reliability, or factuality. Specifically, it is necessary to classify all the propositions (and their relationships) according to their degree of veracity. Now, the latter depends, each time, on the number and importance of the textually true propositions or relationships which</page><page sequence="8">550 Poetics Today 12:3 are contradicted or confirmed. Let p and q be two propositions-for- mulated by a character-the first of which does not contradict any true proposition, whereas the second contradicts one. All other things being equal, it can be said that p but not q is in conformity with the textual truth. The same would obtain even if p did not confirm any other propositions and if q confirmed a dozen. Suppose now that p contradicts only one true proposition, but one entailing numerous con- sequences in the narrative universe, and that q contradicts two or three propositions having no consequences at all. One could then maintain, perhaps, that p is less close to an overall textual truth than q. But there are thornier cases. Suppose, for example, that p and q contradict only each other and that one of them confirms more (or a different set of) propositions than the other. Should we consider (on the pretext that the narrative would thereby gain in coherence and richness) the former true and the latter false? In the same way, suppose we find two or three unimportant contradictions in the narrator's discourse. Should we then conclude that s/he is not trustworthy, or should we simply speak of absentmindedness, of trivial miscalculations, or (in the case of a printed text) of typographical errors? In Jean Barois, the protagonist's daughter spends a few months with him when she is eighteen. According to the novel, she was born in 1895 and her stay therefore takes place in 1913. However, during this stay, the father- who was born in 1866-is said to be over fifty: this situates us in at least 1916. Two years later, one of his friends points out that Barois has been struggling against intolerance for fifteen years. Now, Barois began his fight in 1895: this situates us in 1910. The contradictions are obvious; but critics have usually chosen to attribute them to mere lapses on the part of the author (or, more ingeniously, to the difficulty of combining-as Martin du Gard is trying to do-history and fiction). Whatever decisions are made, they will no doubt affect what the work means, and, if narratologists do not have to choose (since their pur- pose is not to determine the meaning or the value of particular texts), they must be able nevertheless to indicate in their models of narrative that the production of narrative meaning sometimes depends on such decisions (a little like the way they must be able to indicate that the same passage can sometimes function as iterative or singulative narra- tion, as free indirect or narratized discourse, as featuring coordination or subordination). In other words, they must be able to make room for (the voice of) a hypothetical receiver, or, to come back to my joke, they must be able to show under what conditions the telephone directory could be read as a novel. This place-this voice-of the receiver, which is frequently thema- tized (through scenes of deciphering, reading, or interpretation), is definable not only in terms of the textual moments noted earlier, but</page><page sequence="9">Prince * Narratology and Meaning 551 also in terms of those implicit texts which the text sometimes relies on to produce meaning or to make a point. To say that a narra- tive adopts external focalization, for example, can mean that it must be complemented by a text which situates the narrated according to an anthropomorphic interiority. Thus, "Hills Like White Elephants," which presents two characters waiting for a train, calls for a metatext expressing the meaning of their wait (the end of their relationship). Similarly, to say that a narrator is unreliable at the level of commentary means that his or her interpretations must be replaced. The events related by the barber in "Haircut" have taken place, but the meaning he attributes to them must give way to another meaning. Finally, and in general, any statement (or any relationship between statements), the veracity of which is textually undecidable, can educe an alethic comment from the receiver, a comment which is obviously connected to the gamut of hors-textes, of other texts which constitute (at least in part) that receiver. In sum, without altering the domain which they mean to explore, without dividing it on the basis of preliminary onto-alethic consider- ations, without ceasing to grant the text a vital role in the production of narrative meaning, without renouncing the ideal of a description of narrative and its possibilities that would be explicit, systematic, and general, and finally, without yielding to the interpretive temptation (it will still be a matter of characterizing the factors in terms of which nar- rative signifies and not of specifying what it signifies), narratologists must take into account the possible alethic differences of the worlds and statements constituting the narrative text as well as the type of tex- tual contributions asked of a receiver. It is on this condition that they (that we!) will be able to explain the semantic functioning of narrative and to make narratology fit into a general semiotics.
