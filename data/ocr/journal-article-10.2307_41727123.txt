<plain_text><page sequence="1">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="2">by Terence Grieder and Alberto Bueno Mendoza n a desolate canyon in the high Andes of north- ern Peru, the secrets of one of America's oldest civilizations are coming to light. Five thousand years ago, the ancient people who lived there built elaborate temples and tombs and shared a beautiful art. For a thousand years before the introduction of pottery, artists and craftmen worked in bone and shell, stone, basketry and especially in textiles. The arid climate at the ruins of La Galgada has pre- served the richest collection of cultural material available in the Andean highlands during the period between 3000 and 2000 B.C. That period, called the Preceramic, has begun to show the sur- prising beginning of one of the New World's great- est styles and the origins of a distinctively Peruvian civilization. Study of the Peruvian Preceramic period began in 1946 when the archaeologist Junius Bird exca- vated the ancient mound of Huaca Prieta on the Pacific coast. In the time since the Huaca Prieta excavations, countless Preceramic sites have been identified in Peru and about a dozen or so have been sampled by excavation. The Preceramic ended about 2000 B.C. when pottery making was intro- duced, but how to define the beginning of the period is a more complex issue. The term Preceramic has sometimes been used to cover all of the millennia of human occupation in Peru before pottery. Now thanks to a series of Preceramic site excavations a more meaningful definition of this important period is emerging. Archaeologists have determined that during about 3000 B.C. the most advanced Peruvian communities already showed many traits which set them apart from the earliest hunter-gatherers and sedentary farmers and linked them with the later Peruvian civilizations. These people lived in densely settled towns with large temples and built tombs for the upper class which held burial offerings of textiles and jewelry. The principal thing they lacked was pottery. The site of La Galgada is located in the canyon of the Tablachaca River, the main tributary of the largest river on Peru's west coast. The unfailing presence of water was surely the attraction to an- cient farmers. Even today many of the same plants used by ancient inhabitants grow in the canyon, an indication that the climate 5,000 years ago was not too different. The ancient inhabitants of La Galgada raised Lima beans, peanuts, avocados, mangos, bananas and several other food plants as well as abundant cotton along the banks of the river. Al- though game animals must have been plentiful in the surrounding mountains, animal bones are almost nonexistent in the debris of the ruins. This may imply a diet based mainly on agricultural products. The site extends for about one kilometer along the east bank of the river with three ceremonial complexes forming the nuclei of settlements. A slightly different pattern of platforms around a large temple, all apparently Preceramic in date, was discovered on the opposite west bank. Since 1976 we have been studying the largest of the east bank settlements. It contained about 50 houses but others were destroyed when a road was built through La Galgada in 1975. If all of the houses had been occupied by families of five, this area had a population of over 250 people, which probably con- stituted about one-fourth of the population of the whole site. The road project also cut through the temple complex and covered over early levels along the façade of the large north temple while destroy- ing half of the later part of the small south temple. In 1978 excavations concentrated on the all- important salvage of the south temple. Then in 1979 and 1980 work focused on deciphering the architec- tural history of the large north temple. The unusual historical significance of La Galgada is based in part on its exceptionally fine and well-preserved ar- chitecture. These remains have dictated a conserva- tive excavation approach in which the remains of every single architectural period are preserved and only unrestorable rubble and exposed fill are re- moved. The survival of the monument has the high- est priority in an effort to carefully probe and record the deeper levels of this major temple complex. The north temple was completely rebuilt at least four times. The earliest excavated level, which probably dates to about 3000 B.C., contains a cere- monial firepit chamber of a type found also at Kotosh and Huaricoto which remained the typical ceremonial structure throughout the Preceramic in the highlands. At that time the floor level was al- ready 13 meters above the base of the façade facing the river. It seems likely that there are lower, earlier levels still to be discovered within the mound. The temple was completely rebuilt in about 2800 B.C. with new ceremonial chambers on top and a massive encircling wall. Several centuries later the cham- bers were filled with two meters of fill to support new floor levels, and a new encircling wall was con- structed. Then in about 2000 B.C. when the first crude pottery began appearing on the site, the whole north temple was encased in a still larger structure. March/ April 1981 45</page><page sequence="3">During this rebuilding the small circular ceremo- nial firepit chambers which had stood for a thousand years were replaced by rectangular rooms forming a U around the square courtyard. Only the stump of the large encircling wall remains, and just traces of the rectangular buildings lie on top of the mound. The massive temple walls appear to have served only to retain fill and make the temple higher and more impressive and do not seem to have been de- fensive. In fact, the walls of the later south temple never »reached a defensible height. One can only speculate about the use of the ceremonial firepit chambers. The most common material found on their floors is white, orange, red or green feather down. The only other item lying directly on a chamber floor was the lower half of a large deer antler. These items suggest ceremonies just as the architecture recalls the Pueblo kivas of North America. Perhaps the ancient people sat on the low bench levels around the firepits to take part in their rituals. In most of the chambers there is not enough floor space for dancing or a dramatic ritual such as sandpainting. By about 2500 B.C. the south temple compound had been established south of the large northern mound. Over the following 700 years chamber after chamber was constructed with five successive en- largements of the encircling wall. The reuse of the old ceremonial chambers as tombs is most clear in this compound. When a chamber was about to be abandoned a rough wall of large stones was placed a meter from the chamber walls. Flat stones were laid as roof beams from the new wall to the old chamber walls; then this structure was buried under the earth and rock fill leaving a stone-lined shaft lead- ing to the new surface. The small subterranean chambers held from three to five bodies. Those dat- 46 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">(Left) The southeast corner of the North Temple at La Galgada .

These represent the oldest known American examples of shaft tombs in which the tomb chamber was reached by a shaft or tunnel. In later times such tombs were widely used along the west coast of Middle and South America. Other tombs at La Galgada were built entirely new into the spaces between the encircling walls and be- tween the two temple compounds. These examples, which date to the later part of the Preceramic or the beginning of the Initial Ceramic period, were built of very large unshaped or roughly shaped stones. They appear to be the prototypes for the so-called galleries of the Cha vín temples of the Early Horizon period (1500-500 B.C.). Chavin temples had a labyrinth of corridors or "galleries" but no real in- terior rooms. The gallery form as well as the mas- sive stones used in their construction is anticipated in the tombs at La Galgada. The Preceramic temples are also notable for the ornamental construction of both the interior and ex- terior walls. Even in the earliest building, con- structed of rounded waterworn stones, a level pro- jecting dado was built with straight-lined trapezoi- dal niches set upon it. Such rectilinear forms would seem to be hard to build with rounded stones but they took their final form in the thick mud plaster which covered the stone walls. In the later buildings of squared quarry stone various wall articulations were constructed: dados, projecting stringcourses, projections over corbels, and a course of horizontal niches. In the later walls thick and thin courses of masonry were alternated, but even those carefully laid walls were probably plastered over with mud and painted white. Some walls show an undercoat of yellow but the final coat always seems to have been March/ April 1981 47</page><page sequence="5">The firepit vent in the rectangular chamber in the South Temple has an opening just inside the doorstep which once supplied air to the firepit. a polished pearly white. The other early Peruvian sites of Kotosh and Moxeke show representational modeling of the mud plaster and painting on the walls, but nothing of that sort has been found at La Galgada. There architectural ornament seems to have been confined to the pure abstract articulation of the walls themselves. TThe tombs have provided most of the other exam- ples of arts and crafts, especially jewelry, baskets, a stone cup and mortars, and textiles. Peru is famous for its ancient textiles which comprise one of the best preserved and numerically richest archives of ancient cráft. Along with similar Preceramic textile fragments from Huaca Prieta, Guitarrero Cave and a few other sites, the La Galgada textile fragments provide important evidence of the early develop- ment of textile manufacture and tantalizing glimps- es of its high artistic achievement. Aside from the occasional use of coarser plant fibers, all of the cloth at La Galgada was made of cotton, presumably grown locally. None of the recovered fragments con- tains any wool. The preference for cotton is typical of all the known Preceramic textiles. Blankets and bags are the two most common identifiable items, each produced by its own characteristic Peruvian technique, the blankets by twining, the bags by looping. Each of these methods has its natural range of expression - weft- twining lending itself to the flat areas of blankets and looping adapting well to the shaped forms of the bags. But a number of other techniques have been found, such as netting, knot- ted looping and interlooping. All of these techniques are common to all the known Preceramic textile groups. It appears from the fragments in the burials that men carried a round bag like a purse made by loop- ing. These bags must have been objects of special pride for they are works of art - of the nine bags whose designs can be most fully reconstructed no two are alike. Birds seem to have been the subject of three, two seem to have related snake designs, two 48 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">had circular or curvilinear patterns and one was rectilinear, all probably based on some natural themes, and one had a frontal figure with an elabo- rate costume. This last design probably represented an anthropomorphic deity to judge from the frontal pose and the costume. The same figure is common in later Peruvian art but is still not clearly identifiable by name. The bags give no clue to their original contents except that small baskets were placed in- side such bags in one buriai. The makers of the bags took full advantage of the design freedom permitted by the looping technique. None of the designs is painted on, but in every case the color change is a change of thread. The ancient designers evidently shared the modern aesthetic ideal that the decoration should be inte- gral to the structure of the fabric. Despite the frag- mentary nature of the textiles, the original colors are well preserved: red, yellow, blue and black, as well as natural brown and white have been re- corded. The first loom-made textiles from La Galgada belong to the end of the Precerainic period. The ear- lier, non-loom textiles often must have been made on a frame of sticks, but each manipulation dealt with only one warp thread or at most one pair. The new element was the harness, a stick with heddles or strings attached to alternate warp threads. By raising the harness every other warp thread was raised simultaneously. The earliest woven textiles at La Galgada are narrow cotton belts, showing that the loom was at first narrow- about five centime- ters wide - and its harness raised only the few warps required by that width. Thé widening of the loom was a very slow process. Even a thousand years later the standard width of woven textiles in Peru was a mere 33 centimeters or about a foot. The deco- ration of Preceramic cloth was all done by ma- nipulating individual threads which^was no longer possible when the loom was used. An early woven belt shows the plain cloth which was the natural product of the loom. Dissatisfied with its lack of decoration, the weaver painted dark brown stripes</page><page sequence="7">(Top, left) Jewelry from a Preceramic tomb includes bone hairpins inlaid with turquise, shell and turquoise beads and shell pendants. Length of hairpins range from 11.6 to 15.8 centimeters. (Above) This flexed burial was found wrapped in layers of cloth in a Late Preceramic tomb in the South Temple.

The brown dye was slightly acid and eventually destroyed the material. Not until tapes- try was invented nearly 2,000 years later did Peru- vian weavers again achieve the structural orna- ment of cloth found in the Late Preceramic twined and looped fabrics. In 1979 four shell disks were discovered attached to an early woven cloth in the square patio of the north temple in a level with a radiocarbon age of 3540 B.P. ± 50. When corrected by dendrochronology to calendar years a date of between 2140 and 1860 B.C. was produced. That date is of special interest because three of the disks are decorated with de- signs which show the transition from the Pre- ceramic art style to the Chavin style. The powerful and widespread Chavin style dominated Peruvian art from its great ceremonial center at Chavin de Huantar in the mountains about a hundred air miles or 160 kilometers south of La Galgada from about 1500 to 500 B.C. The presence of a Chavin style ornament in such an early level suggests an earlier and longer development of the Chavin style than has been envisioned before. The simplest of the or- namented disks is made of white shell with four bird heads on the rim, their eyes inlaid with red or green stone. That circle is also the smallest, measuring just 3.28 centimeters including the bird heads. The second iridescent shell disk is incised with an angu- lar abstract design based on the head of a raptorial bird with a hooked beak. Red paint was rubbed into the incisions. While the first disk is characteristi- cally Preceramic in style with its plain surfaces, small size, simple bird heads and varicolored inlays, the second disk begins to show Chavin characteris- 50 Archaeology</page><page sequence="8">(Top, left) Stacked baskets from a Late Preceramic tomb contained a cotton bag with a double snake design.

The third disk is entirely in the Chavin style. The four heads are now those of fanged feline monsters typical of Chavin art and are made of modular strips and bands. The shell is orange spondylus imported from the Ecuadorean coast and is deeply excised to hold bands of red pig- ment. The presence of this disk along with the others implies the existence of the mature Chavin style before 1800 B.C. Altogether the three decorated disks suggest that Peruvian art developed from Preceramic to Chavin style more rapidly than has been thought previously. La Galgada offers a variety of insights into the cultural history of Peru. It confirms what other sites have begun to reveal - that Preceramic sites were far from being isolated primitive villages. Instead they formed a large region unified by shared styles of art and architecture. The long se- ries of buildings and other cultural materials found at La Galgada provide evidence for the rapid social and cultural progress made during the Preceramic period. Already at this early time there is ample evidence of the artistic principles and elements of style and technique, as well as patterns of settle- ment and land use, which are characteristic of later Peruvian civilization. The Preceramic represents the beginning of a distinctive Peruvian civilization united especially by styles of architecture and tex- tiles long before the introduction of pottery.
