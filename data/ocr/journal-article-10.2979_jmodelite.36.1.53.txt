<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Between Sensation and Sign:   The Secret Language of The Waves Maureen Chun University of Hong Kong  The structure of Virginia Woolf ’s late novel The Waves, which alternates between  interludes of an uninhabited seascape and a series of non-mimetic soliloquies, has long  puzzled and intrigued her critics. This essay argues that the images that circulate not  only between separate soliloquies, but also between soliloquy and interlude, traverse the  boundary between objectivity and subjectivity and frame sensations, perceptions, and  thoughts as physical presences in the real world. In the recurrent treatment of words as  sensuous entities, moreover, the novel suggests that all practices of language and aspects  of consciousness are essentially physical phenomena in the world of people, words, and  waves. The Waves thus accomplishes something new and largely unrecognized in  modern narrative: the language, imagery, structure, and themes collectively establish  the continuity of word, narrative, and world through a non-subjective, physicalized  consciousness. Keywords: Virginia Woolf / consciousness / metaphor / narrative In a well-known passage from her memoir “A Sketch of the Past,” Woolf reflects upon how isolated “shocks” she experienced as a child, variously characterized as moments of non-being, horror, and revelation, have crucially shaped her art  and her philosophy of art: . . . [I]t is a constant idea of mine; that behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern;  that we — I mean all human beings — are connected with this; that the whole world  is a work of art; that we are parts of the work of art. Hamlet or a Beethoven quartet  is the truth about this vast mass that we call the world. But there is no Shakespeare,  there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words;  we are the music; we are the things itself. And I see this when I have a shock.  . . . If I were painting myself I should have to find some — rod, shall I say — some- thing that would stand for the conception. It proves that one’s life is not confined to  one’s body and what one says and does; one is living all the time in relation to certain  background rods or conceptions. (MB 72–3) </page> <page sequence="2"> 54 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 By claiming that we are parts of the world as a work of art, Woolf binds us to  the media of art, to words, sounds, and things. We are the things of art in the  world as art. After mentioning music and literature, Woolf brings up painting  to consider how she would visually depict her relationship to the meaning of her  shocks. The move is unexpected, as we know she is a writer — why then does she  resort to painting? Why would the revelation of the limitlessness of the self be  represented as a material object, presumably relegated to the background of a self- portrait? The painting analogy suggests something startling about the nature of  consciousness: it is a physical phenomenon that leaves patterns and traces in the  world. There exists a strange contiguity between the physical world and thoughts  and feelings, which may exit the body of the self. And within the world as art,  words are both sounds and paint-like things. In this memoir from 1938, Woolf makes an implicit comparison between  painting and her own literary art that is especially relevant to a reading of The  Waves, published in 1931. The structure of the late novel, which alternates between  interludes of an uninhabited seascape and a series of non-mimetic soliloquies, has  long puzzled and engaged her critics. The “objective” interludes are presented  from the perspective of an omniscient narrator; the soliloquies are tagged without  exception as first-person perspective. But what Bernard, Susan, Rhoda, Neville,  Jinny, and Louis “said” does not imitate naturalistic speech and remains stylis- tically undifferentiated. More intriguingly, images circulate not only between  separate soliloquies, but also between soliloquy and interlude. In this way, the  images that traverse the boundary between objectivity and subjectivity demon- strate how Woolf attempted to frame sensations, perceptions, and consciousness  itself as physical phenomena in the real world. This consciousness consists of the  entire spectrum of experience between insensibility and conscious thought, in  which a revelation may be at once conception and shock, thought and sensation;  in the novel, reflective self-awareness is not a privileged mode that alone reveals  and corresponds to the true state of things. The hidden pattern of the world into which we are woven is spiritual, but  not immaterial: both human consciousness and human bodies are things of and  in the world. The rod is not a psychic projection, nor is the revelatory conception  an essentially psychological construct. What one says and does, feels and thinks,  is not confined to a person’s body or psychology; it becomes physicalized, deper- sonalized, and finally non-subjective. An impersonal consciousness, unfixed in  subjectivity, both corresponds to and infiltrates the limitless physical world. In presenting the components of consciousness as things embedded in the  “vast mass” of the world, the essay illuminates two fundamental aspects of the  language of The Waves. First, neither the language of the interludes nor the  soliloquies can be attributed to an omniscient or private perspective, to an unseen  narrator or to an individual character. Thus the images of the stylistically homog- enous soliloquies — as well as the sense impressions they represent — cannot be  characterized as strictly subjective. Consciousness is not “confined to one’s body,”  or even human bodies. Second, though the language of narrative is inevitably  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Secret Language of The Waves 55 committed to representation, the very words that compose images remain things  of the world, both sonorous as music and material as paint. The Waves embodies  Woolf ’s attempt to unsettle the ineradicable symbolic function of language, to  disturb the abstractions of signification, by renewing a sense of words as things.  This project recalls the practices of many modern writers, among them Baude- laire, Mallarmé, the Surrealists and Dadaists, and Gertrude Stein, in whose  work the unsymbolical aspect of language — its sounds and its materiality as  writing — emerges as representation is unsettled and metaphor transformed. Like  Joyce and Proust, Woolf uses the novel to explore the complexity of identity and  consciousness, and to expand the possibilities of narrative through new forms and  styles. Woolf ’s novel nonetheless departs from all their writings in reaching the  physical world beyond the book through the sensuous basis of language, and in  relating through narrative the physical rather than subjective or semiotic nature  of consciousness. In short, its original vision establishes the continuity of words,  narrative, and world through a physicalized consciousness. Formally solitary even  within Woolf ’s corpus, it narrates the experience of this consciousness over a life- time through language that does not distinguish between interiority and reality,  or drama and scene, and thus decisively denies subjectivity as a psychic construct. The words of art are in the world as art, yet to tell a story, which becomes  Bernard’s central passion, words must communicate or represent symbolically. To  scrutinize the language of The Waves, then, is to see how the collective story of  the six characters is conveyed through a narrative structure whose images signify  in multiple ways. In this essay, I will investigate the disparate registers on which  the novel’s images operate: metaphoric, in their function as creative, meaningful  emblems of states of non-subjective consciousness; indexical, in Peirce’s sense,  as signs of the material contiguity between self and world and between persons;  literal, as descriptions of tactile objects encountered by the characters; and, most  rarely, simply phonemic or material, as marks printed on a page or constructed  from nothing more than the sounds of words, themselves sensuous entities that  do not necessarily signify at all. Formally, stylistically, and thematically, the novel  insists that all practices of art and language and all aspects of life are essentially  physical phenomena in the world of sounds and things, words, and waves. To begin, I will establish how consciousness is radically depersonalized and  physicalized in the novel and how this impersonal consciousness reflects Woolf ’s  assimilation of the scientific and philosophical writings of her time, as well as  the impact on her work of the nascent art of cinema. Film, I will show, alerted  Woolf to the possibility of using words and literary images in ways that would  unsettle narrative as a system of representation.1 In The Waves, as in the cinema,  we discover several recurring images functioning, sometimes simultaneously, on  different semiotic registers. One such recurring image is that of words them- selves. In many illuminating instances, the characters perceive words as sensuous,  synesthetically evocative phenomena or things rather than basic units of verbal  representation. We see the non-semantic, purely perceptual aura of such words  and phrases fluctuate and pass through separate minds, with all the impalpability  </page> <page sequence="4"> 56 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 and physical reality of smoke or air, in ways analogous to the non-subjective drift  of sense-impressions represented in the circulation of images — with the differ- ence that, whereas the multiple valences of the word “wave,” for instance, are  each meaningfully related to the waves of the real world of referents, with a few  recurring image-words, such as “fin,” we encounter a startlingly tenuous relation  to the referent that further unsettles the conventions of reading narrative. With  the appearance of such words emerges something closely akin to what Woolf in  her essay “The Cinema” calls a “secret language” without words: “a language we  feel and see, but do no speak” (CD 184). This obscure, impossibly non-linguistic  language operates beneath narrative language as a system of representation, and  occasionally surges to view in moments that reassert that there remain elements  of language, life, and the real world that resist the human work of signification.  Beneath the current of the stylistically homogenous soliloquies — and, on the  lexical and syntactic level, the rhythmic repetitions, paratactic clauses, and indif- ferentiation between the registers of expression, description, and narration — one  detects the play of a secret language with its own grammar and syntax. I am attempting, then, the reading of two languages: the language of the  narrative, and the metaphorical “secret language,” grammar, and syntax that  subtend the narrative. The two languages coincide at moments, the analysis of  which will serve as the crux of my reading. If my approach seems complicated in  juxtaposing the structure of the narrative with the structure of a metaphorical lan- guage, I believe it is nonetheless necessary to provide a full account of this novel,  structurally unique in Woolf ’s oeuvre. I propose that it is only in these arguably  unspoken soliloquies, framed by an uninhabited landscape, that Woolf shows  us words themselves as imagistic rather than linguistic, the narrative as a kind  of scrim through which we may perceive the secret language of a consciousness  that inheres in the real world beyond narrative. In other words, it is only in this  novel that Woolf does not simply describe or imply through narrative or stylistic  techniques and theme that, as I will argue, consciousness is a kind of impersonal  grammar that does not serve an isolated agent. If the “personal,” conventional  grammar of the writing tells us that “said” binds experience to a single subject,  the grammar of the secret language points to an impersonal consciousness implicit  in every word we write and do or do not speak. The Small PercePTionS of and in The PhySical World  Although the soliloquies are marked as “said” by the characters, it is clear that  they are unspoken and could not be spoken in a naturalistic or dramatic context.  They are in fact unspeakable, as I will explain more fully, representing as they  do a consciousness that cannot be isolated or located in any one perspective. But  this is not to say that this consciousness is a fictional construct. Ann Banfield  has argued that language of narrative indicates the existence of “an objectiv- ized knowledge of subjectivity” distinct from the subjectivity linked to the “I”  of spoken language (US 97). Omniscience and narrative consciousness as terms  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Secret Language of The Waves 57 inadequately describe the ways in which thoughts represented in narrative point  to “the nonequivalence of the speaker and his subjectivity, of the communicative  and the expressive functions” (US 97). That is, narrative contains sentences that  may represent a consciousness that cannot be communicated from or expressed  by a linguistically identifiable perspective. These sentences are unspeakable; the  knowledge, information, and consciousness they represent cannot by articulated  in speech, which necessarily requires a single point of view, and refer to a non- subjective reality. In her writings on Woolf, Banfield makes the connection between the gram- matically unspeakable sentences of narrative and Woolf ’s preoccupation with,  as Bernard puts it, “a world without a self,” arguing persuasively that Woolf ’s  fiction is haunted by the Russellian philosophical goal “to leave one’s perspec- tive and imaginatively project oneself into other perspectives, even the possible  ones inhumanly unoccupied, to experience the world as it would be without the  thinker” (PT 213). While the application of Banfield’s complex linguistic analysis  of narrative language to The Waves is beyond the scope of this essay, I want to  emphasize with Banfield that Woolf ’s work betrays a sense of the inadequacy of  attributing represented consciousness to a character or an omniscient narrator,  and of the notion that this “unspeakable” consciousness is purely fictional and  not a real possibility in the world outside the text. Woolf, like her Bloomsbury  contemporary Bertrand Russell, is eminently concerned with imagining a con- sciousness that cannot be fixed in subjectivity or psychology and refers to the real  state of things in the physical world. The seascape interludes further depersonalize the represented consciousness  of the soliloquies in forming with them an imagistic confluence, just as “Time  Passes” in To the Lighthouse interrupts the current of human drama to underscore  the impersonal consciousness, illuminated in narrative language, which colors all  embodied perspectives. Images of waves and birds by the shore interpenetrate the  soliloquies and the interludes; the waves break insensibly on the shore before and  after Bernard’s death. The seascape descriptions are occasionally punctuated with  anthropomorphic metaphors: “Erratically rays of light flashed and wandered, like  signals from sunken islands, or darts shot through laurel groves by shameless, laughing  boys” (207). The effect is not the humanization of the landscape, but the assimila- tion of the human into the nonhuman, with both engulfed in the vision of an  inhuman eye: “Rimmed in a gold circle the looking-glass held the scene immobile as if  everlasting in its eye” (208). With Bernard’s death, moreover — with the single- sentence eruption of the waves of the sea into the soliloquies — consciousness is  reinvested in the physical world. The correspondence between the sensible images  of the soliloquies, especially the frequent references to waves, and the blind eye  of the landscapes reinforces the eyelessness of human consciousness: speech and  articulated thought based on perspective cannot express the reality that the sensa- tions, and the language, of the characters are not their own. They are immanent in  insensible nature, whose inorganic bodies produce real resonances that infiltrate  and depersonalize the most intimate human experiences. </page> <page sequence="6"> 58 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 The unseeing eye of the looking-glass corresponds to the eyelessness of non- subjective consciousness; it recalls the “inhumanly unoccupied” perspectives of  Russell’s philosophy. What distinguishes the eyeless perspectives of The Waves  from Russell’s theoretical perspectives is the notion that consciousness inheres in  the physical world, and that the human body constitutes the site of impersonal  physical processes. The impersonal consciousness of the subject may reach to the  unoccupied points in space because “external” reality resonates with the body in  its physical embeddedness in reality. In her diaries, Woolf recorded the desire  to write “an abstract mystical eyeless book,” which would “saturate every atom”  in a “combination of thought; sensation; the voice of the sea” (WD 156, 136).  Consciousness in The Waves is an endless series of “saturated atoms”; its images  and sensations may reside and pass through bodies and physical nature alike. The  novel portrays the physics of a non-subjective consciousness that links nature to  the physical composition of the body. If the unspeakable sentences of narrative  indicate objective realities that cannot be related from a subjective point of view,  the very words of narrative — the sensations radiating from them — are also non- subjective phenomena that bind people to the vast mass of the physical world,  the media of all art. Gillian Beer has established the importance of wave-particle theory, espe- cially the work of James Jeans and Arthur Eddington, for Woolf and her intel- lectual contemporaries. Reading Eddington’s The Nature of the Physical World,  Woolf would have been exposed to the idea that the universe, even seemingly self- contained material bodies, consists of the motions of imperceptible but theorizable  waves (112–24).2 Beer reminds us that Woolf was also a reader of Darwin and  Freud, and is persuasive in arguing that their theories of biological and cultural  development enter her work as an emphasis on the survival of prehistory in con- temporary existence, rather than on contemporary life as the product of ongoing  evolution: “The continued presence of sea, clouds, leaves, stones, the animal form  of man, the unchanged perceptual intensity of the senses, all sustain her awareness  of the simultaneity of the prehistoric in our present moment” (17). Theories of both prehistory and the physics of the invisible world leave their  trace in Woolf ’s portrait of the subject in The Waves.3 The novel presents the sub- stance of the body as both sensible and insensible, the overlapping of the animate  and inorganic, and figures it as an entity through which impersonal sensations,  like the theorized wave-particles composing the universe, may pass: in the novel,  consciousness does not always transpire in the subject. Like wave-particles and  the waves of the sea, the rhythms and motions of human consciousness cannot be  restricted to a single substance, and follow the rhythm and motions of nonhuman  nature: “Waves are all the universe contains. The permeable human transmits and  is composed by them” (Beer 64). Waves are, moreover, all that the soliloquies  contain. Each iteration of “I” represents an instance of the waves, the shared mate- rial origin and consciousness of the characters rather than any unique, subjective  voice. When, for example, Bernard’s thoughts in old-age return to his lifelong  companions, he recalls that Susan cried, “I hate; I love” in early childhood, and is  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Secret Language of The Waves 59 able to cite exactly what Susan “said” because the impression represented by this  particular phrase is an instance of the circulation of impersonal consciousness  (248). The moment represents Bernard’s access to privately experienced moments  that have nonetheless passed into his own body. The written soliloquies combine minute sensations and perceptions with  articulate moments of self-consciousness — in most of the characters, or at least  the men who aspire to write — but the demarcations between the spoken, thought,  and preverbal remain largely hypothetical. The reader cannot ultimately be certain  that anything in the soliloquies is spoken aloud, or even thought in the same words.  The effect is the suspicion that what they express may not be rendered in articulate  speech, that Bernard’s desperate struggle to tell stories is an attempt to tell the  unspeakable. The soliloquies are exemplars of the mysterious “language without  words” Woolf posits in her essay “The Cinema,” in which she asks, “Is there some  secret language which we feel and see, but never speak, and, if so, could this be  made visible to the eye? Is there any characteristic which thought possessed that can  be rendered visible without the help of words?” (CD 184). She writes that the “visual  emotion” conveyed by the tadpole-shaped shadow she sees on a movie screen, an  accident of projection and not an image recorded on the film reel of The Cabinet  of Dr. Caligari, is “fear itself, and not the statement, ‘I am afraid’ ” (CD 184, 183).  From this example we can deduce that Woolf is actually concerned less with film  than with the principle or idea of the cinematic. It is a principle that films them- selves may fail to reproduce: to reduce the shadow on the screen to the statement  “I am afraid” would be to subscribe to the determinism of conventional narrative  cinema, in which “A kiss is love. A broken cup is jealousy. A grin is happiness.  Death is a hearse.” David Trotter quotes this parodic passage from “The Cinema”  to point out that “What Woolf didn’t like about films of this kind was what she  didn’t like about novels of a certain kind: their determinism, their reduction of  sense to meaning, of suggestiveness to intelligibility” (166). In The Waves, the secret  language finds cinematic embodiment in the unspoken soliloquies in which sense  trumps the rigid, merely rhetorical intelligibility of the statement “I am afraid.” The tadpole-shadow does not signify; it is fear itself. The shifting shadows  and light waves on the screen converge with a privately felt affect via a physi- cal body penetrated by the impersonal waves of physical reality. What appears  at first as a moment of psychosis represents in fact Woolf ’s fidelity to the real  world of physically palpable and traceable phenomena. Fear is not projected onto  the shadow; something of consciousness corresponds physically, and not merely  metaphorically, with the world beyond the body. It is the rhetoric and symbolic  language of subjective perspective that betrays the physicality of the body and  denies its contiguity with the vast mass of reality — including the very matter  of language. Laura Marcus observes in her reading of “The Cinema” that Woolf  “found a film aesthetic in the recording of ‘physical realities,’ but imagined a future  in which ‘emotion and thought’ would be added to this reality” (119).4 Indeed, in the novel, emotion and thought mingle with physical reality to the  point where consciousness cannot be defined as a wholly organic process, and is  </page> <page sequence="8"> 60 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 inarticulable insofar as it inheres in the nonhuman. The waves, on the one hand,  are a metaphor for consciousness; on the other, they exceed a relation of sheer  comparison. The final words of the novel, The waves broke on the shore, dissolve  the allegory. They are literal; they do not represent Bernard’s death, but absorb  it. Through the novel’s transit, the meaning of the waves completes a full circle.  The waves open as literal waves and emblems of inanimate nature. They develop  as metaphors, expressive of the way the characters are like the waves, especially  in the habitual, unconscious and preconscious states experienced in the quotid- ian, insensible rhythm of life passed on through each generation. “My children  will carry me on; their teething, their crying, their going to school and coming  back will be like the waves of the sea to me,” says the earthy Susan (132). The  inanimate waves come to suggest the inorganic matter of the body exercised by  the rhythms of nature. As the soliloquies shift their focus from impressions of childhood and youth  to mature desires for eloquence, the waves signify more emphatically the nonver- bal. We feel and see that we are like waves — that we float on unseen waves, and  that they pass through us — but cannot satisfyingly pinpoint and state that part  of ourselves, in the same way a blot on a movie screen cannot state fear because it  seems to be “fear itself.” To say “I am afraid” is inadequate, because in this case the  affect has absorbed, or even negated the subject; the blot becomes the unspeakable  aspect of physicalized consciousness. The inorganic waves of the body give way to  the physical waves of both body and consciousness. Because this part of human  nature cannot be stated, the soliloquies signify the eyelessness of sensations that  exceed individual experience. Finally, the waves represent and carry our own  mortal, inorganic, speechless natures, the “secret language which we feel and see”  in The Waves as a novel. In “The Cinema,” Woolf claims to be advocating an aesthetic for cinema,  yet her essay betrays an analogous ambition for literature: “Terror has besides its  ordinary forms the shape of a tadpole; it burgeons, bulges, quivers, disappears.  Anger is not merely rant and rhetoric, red faces and clenched fists. It is perhaps a  black line wriggling upon a white sheet” (CD 183–4). Here, she subtly proposes  that language draw attention to its own materiality, as a series of black marks on  a white page, and thus realize the possible materialization of visual emotion that  would form the basis of a secret language without words. The shimmering lan- guage of the soliloquies translates that “residue of visual emotion which is of no  use either to painter or to poet” into symbols “quite unlike the real objects which  we see before us” (CD 184). That is, they contain images that hover on the cusp of  signification between metaphor and naturalistic, iconic representation, and words  that appear at times as sensuous, synesthetic images drifting uncertainly between  Peircean symbol and index. It is in this sense that the words on the page are part  of a “language without words.” Early on, as children in a schoolroom, for example, the six characters are  asked to conjugate a Latin verb. (It should be kept in mind that any account of  what happens in the novel must be deduced from the mimetic slippages in the  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Secret Language of The Waves 61 general non-mimetic tenor of the soliloquies). Louis is afraid of saying the answer  aloud in his Australian accent, but compels himself to speak. The others then  respond in ways that confirm the tendencies of character that have already been  suggested in preceding soliloquies: “Those are white words,” said Susan, “like stones one picks up by the seashore.”  “They flick their tails right and left as I speak them,” said Bernard. “They wag  their tails; they flick their tails; they move through the air in flocks, now this way,  now that way, moving all together, now dividing, now coming together.”  “Those are yellow words, those are fiery words,” said Jinny. “I should like a fiery  dress, a yellow dress, a fulvous dress to wear in the evening.”  “Each tense,” said Neville, “means differently. There is an order in this world; there  are distinctions, there are differences in this world, upon whose verge I step. For this  is only a beginning.”  “Now Miss Hudson,” said Rhoda, “has shut the book. Now taking her lump of  chalk she draws figures, six, seven, eight, and then a cross and then a line on the  blackboard. What is the answer? The others look; they look with understanding. . . .  But I cannot write. I see only figures.” (20–21)  It remains unclear of which words Susan, Bernard, Jinny, and Neville are  thinking: the words Louis (probably) says aloud, the words printed in a book that  they are asked to conjugate, or those spoken by the teacher; the words each may  be saying aloud in their turn, which seems to be the case for Bernard; the words  forming in their minds as answers. The effect of the ambiguity is seeing how each  of the possible sets of words shades into and echoes another in a kind of synesthetic  medium and continuum. In each case, the words invoke sensations rather than  significations; even Neville feels he is on the threshold of differences in the world.  Unlike the others, Rhoda responds to numbers rather than words. The figures on  the board appear to her as purely unsymbolical marks that recall the terrifying  tadpole on the screen of Woolf ’s essay. The juxtaposition of word with numbers,  figures yet more abstract and symbolic than language, reinforces that beneath  any understanding of their symbolic import the characters may possess exists a  “language” of sensation. As in Baudelaire’s famous poem, synesthesia is not simply  the disordering of the senses, but indicates an associative network of relations to  the physical world in which human sensations and perceptions mingle with the  impressions of things, in the double sense of our impressions of them and their  own of us: “forests of symbols between us and the shrine / remark our passage with  accustomed eyes”; “the sounds, the scents, the colors correspond” (16). The words of The Waves are not simply or necessarily the arbitrary, conven- tional symbols of Peircean or Saussurean semiotics. They exist on a spectrum  between symbolic function — the conventional usage of language as a symbolic  system — and profound indexical connectedness to the egoless experience of  materialized visual emotion. There is an insistent sense throughout the novel  that words bear some kind of unsymbolical meaningfulness independent of the  human subject, just as the language of narrative posits the reality of eyeless,  </page> <page sequence="10"> 62 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 nonperspectivist knowledge. Peirce concisely defines an index as “a sign which  would, at once, lose the character which makes it a sign if its object were removed,  but would not lose that character if there were no interpretant,” whereas a “symbol  is a sign which would lose the character which renders it a sign if there were no  interpretant. Such is any utterance of speech which signifies what it does only by  virtue of its being understood to have that signification” (239–40). The compo- nents of the indexical sign are bound in a necessary and logical relationship based  on non-subjective phenomena. Within this context of impersonal consciousness,  in which one character may observe and sense another’s sensation, the circulating  images and phrases come to represent the indexical, physical contiguity between  all persons and between the self and the waves of inanimate nature. Thus Bernard,  made up, as he says, of the same “undifferentiated blobs of matter” as his friends,  is able to “cite” their emotions and sensations from childhood late in life (246). The repetition of images and words traveling between characters establishes,  moreover, the indexical connection between word and sensation. Words begin to  resemble natural formations with encrusted meanings when they are evoked by,  rather than evoke, a synesthetic sensation. Bernard himself appears conscious of  this quality of words and phrases when he says, on vacation in Rome, Leaning over this parapet I see far out a waste of water. A fin turns. This bare visual  impression is unattached to any line of reason, it springs up as one might see the  fin of a porpoise on the horizon. Visual impressions often communicate thus briefly  statements that we shall in time to come uncover and coax into words. I note under  f., therefore, “Fin in a waste of waters.” [. . .]  Now I shall go and lunch somewhere, I shall hold my glass up, I shall look through  the wine, I shall observe with more than my usual detachment, and when a pretty  woman enters the restaurant and comes down the room between the tables I shall  say to myself, Look where she comes against a waste of waters. A meaningless  observation, but to me, solemn, slate-coloured, with a fatal sound of ruining worlds  and waters falling to destruction. (189)  The fin is not merely a visual impression; the word itself is mysteriously,  irrationally tied to an inarticulable synesthetic sensation. For the impression  “springs up as one might see the fin of a porpoise on the horizon”: here, some “bare”  incommunicable impression outside “any line of reason” evokes the word “fin” and  precedes the symbolic meaning of fin and the image of a porpoise.5 Words are not  only aurally sensuous, they bear traces of the “visual emotion” that mysteriously  joins on a spectrum the unspoken secret language that belongs to no one person  with the symbolic language of the I who imagines a porpoise and records “fin in  a waste of waters.” To apply the fin as a metaphor for an attractive woman in a  restaurant is a meaningless act, as the fin itself, Bernard’s writerly shorthand for a  visual impression, has no clear referent. The implication is that the root of meta- phor is not observation but sensation. The original visual impression invokes the  word fin because the only certainty of the perceptual moment is that he is looking  out onto water — which, of course, is also not quite stable as a referent in the novel,  </page> <page sequence="11"> The Secret Language of The Waves 63 and becomes the waters of self-dissolution in the restaurant. The water suggests  the word fin, almost as a dead metaphor, simply because porpoises inhabit water. As the fin turns, the sensation is troped. In the restaurant, it is again uncov- ered and coaxed into words but emerges as a new sensation and perception — as  a sound, mysteriously influenced by the way he imagines the look of wine and a  pretty woman.6 In the second instance, however, “fin” does not appear explicitly,  but is implicitly linked to the woman. “Fin,” then, enacts the erasure of subjective  difference between self and other and thing, much as the tadpole-shadow evacu- ates Woolf as spectator of subjective coherence. That is, the fin in a waste of waters,  the woman, and the accidental projection each represent something substantial  in the world that disturbs selfhood.7 Fin as word, image, and metaphor stands as  a paradigmatic and prismatic instance of the critical, slippery, unspeakable point  of intersection between external thing and sensation, between lifenessness and  sensation. The “slate-coloured” observation carries the sinister impression of ruin  and destruction, echoing the terrors of self-dissolution and speechlessness that  pervade the novel. The word fin also appears in the interludes when a “wave of light passed in a  sudden flaunt and flash as if a fin cut the green glass of a lake” (182). Later on, after  recording “fin in a waste of waters” in his notebook, Bernard describes moments  of human intercourse sinking “into one of those silences which are now and again  broken by a few words, as if a fin rose in the wastes of silence; and then the fin, the  thought, sinks back into the depths spreading round it a little ripple of satisfaction,  content” (273). “Fin” as word-image is evoked and modified throughout the novel  to the point where the bare word appears as a leitmotif that gathers signifying  richness even as it gestures toward the sensuousness of Gertrude Stein’s hollowed- out language. Variously framed as sensation and index, bare word and aquatic  metaphor, thought and metaphor for words in the “objective” interlude and the  soliloquies, “fin” comes to represent the complex intermingling of consciousness  and physical reality. Relational and sensuous rather than representational or symbolic, Bernard’s  impersonal fin expresses what Leibniz states as the “relation between each being  and the rest of the universe.” The words and images of the narrative are neither  strictly subjective nor objective; language is more a sensuous than signifying  phenomenon that indexically binds people, words, and things. Sensation is not  represented by language so much as it is disseminated in the impersonality of both  language and consciousness. In his New Essays on Human Understanding, Leibniz  describes the small perceptions of consciousness as an infinity of un- or pre- conscious moments, “changes in the soul that we do not notice.” He insists that  they are “of greater effectiveness than one thinks,” elaborating, “They form this  ‘ je ne sais quoi,’ these tastes, these images of the senses and their qualities, clear  in the assemblage, but confused in their parts, these impressions that surrounding  bodies exert on us, and that envelop infinity: this relation that each being has with  the rest of the universe” (41; my translation). The infinity of impersonal small per- ceptions may lead to self-awareness when they become “clear in the assemblage,”  </page> <page sequence="12"> 64 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 or, just as easily, fall back to its loss. Leibniz thus establishes, according to Daniel  Heller-Roazen, “a region of the mind unimagined by both Descartes and Locke:  a region in which consciousness and its absence meet in the terrain of incessant  and infinitely minute perceptions” — where “living things come to their senses,”  and “once sentient” “come to lose them” (190, 205). The characters of The Waves  are their own missing observers, haunted by the unspeakable flux of small percep- tions and apperceptions composing the full range of consciousness both within  and between them. As Banfield states, “unlike Leibniz’ monads, Woolf ’s rooms  have windows for contact” (PT 111). But Woolf is not simply painting a Leibnizian prefiguration of the dynamic  Freudian unconscious. When language reaches into the swarm of small percep- tions, it retrieves images that cannot be unfolded as signs. Unlike Ulysses, The  Waves does not posit a kind of master-interpreter affirming the endless exegetical  possibilities of narrative and the minutest elements of language, but highlights  the fine, porous line between language as a repository for signification and as a  conduit for an unspeakable, impersonal consciousness. Poetics overrides herme- neutics: Woolf ’s images — sensuous entities that cannot be broken down to word  and referent, signifier and signified, tenor and vehicle — do not open hermeneutic  possibilities. They embody elements of experience that can be recognized and  delineated but not construed as psychic or textual meaning. The subject is com- posed of sensations that constitute a path to a grammar of consciousness — the  grammar of a secret language — rather than a terrain of semiotic potential. Julie Vandivere has written that the “grammatical and figural complexities” in  The Waves constitute “a primary manifestation of the text’s recurrent doubts about  the stability of any linguistic or ontological assertion. .  .  . Ultimately, Woolf ’s  language in The Waves suggests that there is no choice but to live straddling the  aporia between inevitably opposing constructions embodied within grammati- cal ambiguities” (226). The grammar of ontology I am proposing here precludes  subjective coherence, self-identity, the distinction between this and that rejected  by Louis and Neville, while incorporating, and dissolving, subjectivity within  the secret language of reality. The grammar is a metaphor that corresponds to  Eddington’s theorized wave particles; both are “invisible” but perceptible in the  language, structure, and themes, and point to the physical nature of all things.  To borrow Todorov’s description of grammatical function, “The agent cannot  be endowed with any property, but is rather a blank form which is completed by  different predicates. The agent has no more meaning than a pronoun such as ‘he’  in ‘he who runs’ or ‘he who is brave.’ The grammatical subject is always devoid  of internal properties, for these derive only from a temporary junction with a  predicate” (110–11). The tadpole-like accident of projection described in “The Cinema” presents  precisely this universal grammar in which the subject is absorbed in the experi- ence of fear — a sensation that exists on a continuum of consciousness between  the subject and the physical world. If the shadow, as “fear itself,” is a substantive  rather a verb, it is because Woolf is suggesting that fear — the affect as predicate,  </page> <page sequence="13"> The Secret Language of The Waves 65 as physical effect of reality — contains the lasting and essential grammatical  proposition of which the subject is merely an agent. We may read the characters  of The Waves making pronouncements such as “I am afraid,” but such statements  indicate that he or she is, at that moment, absorbed in fear itself. This absorption  does not constitute an essence for the subject, for the subject is expressed in shift- ing predicates and does not possess fundamental internal properties. In this way,  the sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and emotions of the subject — the poetics  of consciousness — constitute impersonal moments that may enter the subject  from without and exit again into other physical bodies. Susan’s “I hate, I love,”  the waves of the sea, and Bernard’s fin are each such moments as predicates that  may absorb disparate entities. Yet there is also a sense in which the shadow on the screen is itself a gram- matical agent, and that the six characters may also serve as grammatical predi- cates. Each of the six develops recognizable traits and habits, each is associated  with a cluster of motifs and perceptions that the others observe or “cite.” Rhoda  is full of fear and has no body; for her, life, amorphous and wildly unreadable,  “emerges heaving its dark crest from the sea” to which people are bound as “bodies  to wild horses” (64). Louis is an ambitious outsider with an accent; he wants order  and respects tradition. Neville, like Louis, writes poetry, but is alone among the  six in his homosexual longings for a shifting love object. Jinny is entirely at ease  in her body, eager for sex, and aware only of solid things. Susan, too, is comfort- able in her body, but cares little for social life and feels a profound attachment to  nature, expressed primarily through images of her children and farm-life. Bernard  wants to make phrases and tell stories. The novel suggests that insofar as they are  defined by lasting traits, phrases, and images they, like the shadow, are not people  but things whose “internal properties” are wholly impersonal. The permanence  that distinguishes one from another is the expression of the transient, precarious  integrity of the physical body that, like Leibniz’s apperception, is temporarily  “clear in the assemblage” in the infinity of small perceptions. Thus when, dur- ing his “summing up,” Bernard acknowledges that reality eludes his “phantom  phrases,” we see that his imminent death is the other face of Rhoda’s suicide. In  the grammatical unfolding of consciousness, the small perceptions themselves  constitute the syntax between any two physical entities that may serve as either  subject or agent. This consciousness, these perceptions of the world, reside in the  world as the syntactic foundation of an unspeakable secret language. The SecreT language of The STory  If Proust’s epic novel both shows us human mysteries and tells us how we may  understand them through the experience of art, Woolf ’s late novel offers these  mysteries as sensuous phenomena that resist illumination and narrative contextu- alization. Unlike In Search of Lost Time, which unfolds points of our semiotic inter- personal relations with hermeneutic obsession and refinement, The Waves does  not tend to inflection and hypotaxis, but to repetition and parataxis. The central  </page> <page sequence="14"> 66 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 images of The Waves — waves, words, vegetation, death — accumulate mystery  with each iteration, in sentences that abandon the subjective connection between  cause and effect implicit in hypotaxis. In contradistinction to Ulysses, it is less a  novel about the illumination and interpretation of our linguistic consciousness  than a story about the twin mysteries of language and consciousness. Walter Benjamin distinguishes between the modern novel and the story by  stating that, whereas the authority of the storyteller is borrowed from death and  natural history — Leskov, as a great storyteller, has “ventured into the depths of  inanimate nature” — the novel is concerned with isolated human beings and the  meaning of an individual life (3: 161). Citing Lukács, Benjamin argues that the  novel is “the form of a transcendental homelessness” in which life struggles against  time until it fuses with meaning at its conclusion. The Waves is arguably a novel in  that it follows isolated beings and arrives at a novelistic meaning of life, Bernard’s  defiance in the face of death and the waves. Nonetheless, its strange structure  and style in the age of the modernist novel represents a reversion to the art of  storytelling, or at least an attempt to relate the “depths of inanimate nature” and  non-subjective consciousness as a universal story. For Bernard’s tortured preoc- cupation is not simply with making phrases; he wants not only to articulate his  small perceptions in lasting communicable language, but also to give his language  the shape of an expansive narrative. Bernard sees the potential for stories everywhere, yet when stories are  attempted, life in all its indifferent formlessness rushes back. Woolf ’s response,  it would seem, to the torturous “welter of unrecorded sensation” in an “unfeeling  universe that sleeps when we are at our quickest and burns red when we lie asleep,”  is an aesthetics of blindness (257, 280): But how describe the world seen without a self? There are no words. Blue, red — even  they distract, even they hide with thickness instead of letting the light through. How  describe or say anything in articulate words again? — save that it fades, save that it  undergoes a gradual transformation, becomes, even in the course of one short walk,  habitual — this scene also. Blindness returns as one moves and one leaf repeats itself.  Loveliness returns as one looks with all its train of phantom phrases. (287)  Woolf employs language as a series of phantom phrases that repeat, like the leaves  of inanimate nature and one’s barely sensible habits, and thus approach and engage  in — rather than articulate and seize — the universal experience of blindness.8 If  eyelessness is the unspeakable condition of consciousness, blindness represents  a kind of persistent, somatic forgetting in which we may overlook the startling  secret language that subtends the words of symbolic language. The “it” of the third  sentence is an elevated, acute sense of that reality: that sense fades, and as it fades,  the “thickness” of words obscures the eyelessness of impersonality. Following the  rhythmic pattern of the waves, the heightened sense of selflessness may arise as the  terror of signlessness, a fear emblematized by Rhoda in her longing for a “marble  pillar” amid the formless vegetation of the world (205). Yet the perception and  sensation of a world seen without a self may also reassert itself as an ecstatic, and  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Secret Language of The Waves 67 aesthetic, moment of death in life. At such moments it is, as Jinny says at the last  meeting of the soliloquizing figures, “As if the miracle had happened, and life  were stayed here and now.” “And,” Rhoda adds, “we had no more to live” (225).  The Waves opens a spectrum between the terror of awaking to the eyelessness of  subjective dissolution, and the rare ecstasy of mystical moments of egolessness.  Between the two states lie the blindness and loveliness of habit, growth,  sleep, and human attachments. Bernard observes, “We grew; we changed; for,  of course, we are animals. We are not always aware by any means; we breathe,  eat, sleep automatically. We exist not only separately but in undifferentiated  blobs of matter” (246). Jinny and Susan may be less conspicuous or compelling as  overtly feminized, unliterate characters, coquette and maternal countrywoman  respectively, yet they affirm crucially both the mystery and the fact of difference.  If the characters are “forever mixing [themselves] with unknown quantities,”  Jinny’s dreamless vitality and Susan’s homely passions inhere in the original  material sameness from which all the characters emerge (118). In other words,  their experiences — pointedly lacking in the struggle for literary expression and  a symbolic order to things — subtend the struggles of the four others and remind  us that the latter, too, have their moments of dreamless peace and satisfaction in  embodiment. One may feel disillusioned with “articulate words” and prefer “words of one  syllable” — another of Bernard’s motifs — belonging to the language “such as  lovers use” or “such as children speak when they come into a room and see their  mother sewing” (295). On the eve of death he wants “a howl; a cry. . . . I have  done with phrases. . . . Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee-cup,  this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself ” (295). Words of  one syllable, of pure unsignifying sonority embody more expressively the physical  world that resonates with the senses. To waken to the reality of the world without  a self is to see the beauty of “things without attachment,” without the projections  and abstractions of human signification (263). The awareness of eyelessness thus  becomes an aesthetic moment when one seeks, not to impose order and symbols  upon the chaos of consciousness, but to recognize the correspondences between  sensation and the physical world of things in themselves and language as itself. “Blue, red — even they distract, even they hide with thickness instead of let- ting the light through”: phonemes, words and cries of one syllable, resemble colors  and the concrete particulars of the world in their sensuous purity. In Bernard’s last  moments, the elements of language are returned to sensation and thus reinvested  in the material world. Here, through Bernard, Woolf inverts the conventionality  of the arbitrary linguistic sign as the premise for meaning, implicitly reconceptu- alizing it as the iconic basis of meaning-resistant linguistic particles that form the  “phantom phrases” of communication. These phrases may express meaning, but  their sounds retain the unsignifying halo of colors and cries. The language of The  Waves lies somewhere on this spectrum between pure sound, pure unsignifying  syllables, and phantom phrases whose illusoriness may, paradoxically, illuminate  the nature of consciousness. To capitulate to or simply drift with the loveliness of  </page> <page sequence="16"> 68 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 1 phantom phrases is to experience blindness, but blindness as a train of moments  in which the rhythms of embodiment absorb the terrors of death. To tell the story  of a world seen without a self is to negotiate the sounds of eyelessness with the  phantom phrases of blindness. “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,” thinks the aging, nostalgic Clarissa Dal- loway again and again as she prepares for her party. “We perished, each alone”  haunts the arc of the story that leads to the lighthouse. Each is an example of a  phantom phrase that, through sheer insistence and repetition, becomes a mantra,  a touchstone in the face of the very dangers and fears they bespeak. In To the  Lighthouse and her other novels, from The Voyage Out to Between the Acts, Woolf  describes the movements of consciousness in a dramatic context. The Waves does  not simply narrate these movements, but conveys them in a secret, unspoken  language. It aspires to the condition of the story and its sense of the inanimate,  and transforms the meaning of the eyelessness of being to a novelistic and private  meaning. Lily, finally, has her vision; Bernard’s final vision is of blindness, his  last act one of negation and aesthetic defiance that denies Molly Bloom’s final  affirmation of life — the concluding, summary “yes” to Ulysses that affirms the  meaningfulness and productivity of language and experience. The meaning of The  Waves as a novel is the story of our permanently secret, speechless selves. Acknowledgments I thank Maria DiBattista, Jonathan Foltz, Douglas Kerr, and Masha Mimran for their generous  comments on this essay. Notes 1. The language of The Waves thus bears intriguing parallels to Walter Benjamin’s theory of language  as articulated in the 1916 essay “On Language as Such and on the Language of Man” (1: 62–74),  which provides a theory of the mimetic subject at the crossroads of linguistic semiotics and the  “nonverbal language” of physical reality rather than a theory of signification per se. 2. Henry 93–103 provides a more detailed exposition of the influence of James Jeans’s writings on  physics at the time Woolf was writing The Waves, which she links to Russell’s philosophy. 3. Woolf ’s “saturated atoms” also echo the materialist basis of Freud’s theory of the death drive: in  Beyond the Pleasure Principle, published in 1920, Freud postulates that “living substance at the time  of its coming to life was torn apart into small particles,” and in this living substance “the chemical  affinity of inanimate matter persisted” (71). 4. Cf. Trotter: “Film, I would argue, did not teach Woolf how to write eyelessly, but it did teach  her how to imagine eyelessness as an element of the human condition” (172). 5. Ferrer argues that Bernard’s vision “only refers to itself,” also emphasizing that it “springs up as  one might see the fin . . .” (88). In the passage, then, “[e]xternal reality is relegated to the third person,  to a very low rank” (89). In my reading the hypothetical third person confirms the reality of the  vision, its eyelessness and independence of subjective point of view. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Secret Language of The Waves 69 6. Cf. DiBattista: “The fin becomes a symbol that comments on its own symbolic nature as a  medium in which the mutable constantly transforms itself into ever finer emblems of permanence”  (156). 7. In her diary, upon completing the first draft of The Waves, Woolf wrote “I have netted that fin  in the waste of water which appeared to me over the marshes out of my window . . .” (WD 165).  Yet more relevant here, during the composition of To the Lighthouse she wrote, “. . . it is not oneself  but something in the universe that one’s left with. . . . One sees a fin passing far out. What image  can I reach to convey what I mean? Really there is none, I think” (WD 100). Though I am focusing  exclusively here on a careful reading of the published version, the appearance of the word fin here and  elsewhere underscores my argument that Woolf was attempting to unsettle the expressive function  of images and thus connect them, not to subjective experience, but to “something in the universe.” 8. Cf. Rabaté, in which he reads Mallarmé’s famous line, “ ‘The Penultimate is Dead,’ ” as a “peculiar  type of aural obsession” (6) that, in my reading, resembles Bernard’s sense of syllables and phantom  phrases.
