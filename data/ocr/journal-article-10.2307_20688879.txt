<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man and Animal: The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination in a Literary Context Dagmar CG. Lorenz The concepts "man" and "animal," basic to the Western discourse of exclu sion and discrimination, are examined in the context of literary works by au thors who, like Gertrud Kolmar, Elias Canetti, Ilse Aichinger, and younger writers such as Rahel Hutmacher, experienced racial and/or gender-related discrimination. Drawing on recent feminist theory, this article shows that opposition to anthropomorphic attitudes in these authors' works implies a fundamental critique of the dominant paradigm of Western culture, which establishes man's superiority both in terms of species and of gender. Per tinent literary texts are explored from the point of view of contemporary feminist and animal-rights criticism, and parallels between these traditionally separate discourses are brought to light. The article also uncovers opposing cultural norms: Jewish and Christian, feminist and patriarchal, Nazi and humanist, anthropocentric and non-speciest. (DCGL) The following article examines the concepts "man" and "animal" in the context of literature by German and Austrian Jewish authors, to whom Nazi ideology assigned a status similar to or lower than that of animals. My investigation exposes the constructedness of the two categories and reveals opposing cultural norms. Jewish and Christian, feminist and patriarchal, Nazi and humanist, anthropocentric and non speciest. Nazi propaganda manipulated the concept "animal" with all its Cartesian implications in order to make the exclusion of Jews palatable to the German public.1 The category "animal," configured as a life form without consciousness and self-determination, was also invoked to rationalize the murder of the disabled, euphemistically referred to as euthanasia?mercy-killing. In today's Western world the issue of life worthy or unworthy of living or the question of whether society is ever justified in making such life-and-death decisions is a moot point with Women in German Yearbook 14 (1998)</page><page sequence="2">202 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination regard to animals. Contemporary Jewish and Christian practices differ little in that respect even though there is a Jewish tradition of preventing cruelty to animals (tsaar baalei khayim) and the destruction of nature and the earth (bal tashkhif). However, as Joseph Telushkin writes, "within Judaism's hierarchy of values, human beings are above animal and vegetation. Thus Jewish law sanctions animal experimentation when the results can help reduce illness among people" (442). Although the ethical implications of factory farming, laboratory experimentation, and the breeding of animals for the purpose of produc ing donor organs are debated by humanitarian and animal-rights groups, some of whose programs have included feminist views, the general pub lic remains indifferent to these concerns. Feminists, on the other hand, as Lynda Birke writes, have certainly made some links between their concerns and con cerns around animals; in the nineteenth century, this took the form of feminist involvement in antivivisectionist campaigns. For these feminists, there were clear parallels in the ways that women and animals were treated by science. Today, the links have been made mainly in relation to a broader environmentalist politics (33). Probably because of their far-reaching revolutionary potential, animal rights, like environmental issues, face opposition by political and religious conservatives. However, German and Austrian Socialists have also not given any serious consideration to life classified as non- or sub human. " In the humanities, anti-speciest arguments, even by prominent men, have found little resonance. Theodor W. Adorno cites the example of Schopenhauer, who considered it a special merit of his moral philoso phy that it included behavior towards animals, namely, compassion toward animals, and comments: "This was often considered an idiosyn crasy of the private scholar" (Probleme 215). Authors who are op pressed because of their race or gender also often problematize the cate gories "human beings," "animals," and "nature," cognizant of the fact that these classifications are never value-neutral. In Judaism anthropocentric values and the protection of life and nature are constantly negotiated. "When a Jew says he is going hunting to amuse himself, he lies," Walter Rathenau reportedly said in a conver sation with Albert Einstein (Telushkin 449). Vegetarianism is not a foreign concept either. In reference to Genesis 1: 29-30, Telushkin argues that the Bible "discloses that the world once was, and again will be, herbivorous," because "in the killing of animals there is cruelty" (449-50), and Isaac Bashevis Singer stated frequently that "there will be</page><page sequence="3">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 203 no end of wars in the world until people stop killing animals. Slaughter and justice cannot dwell together" (Telushkin 450). The authors under discussion here were assimilated into the German cultural code without being ignorant about Jewish tradition. Even though some of them de-emphasized their Jewishness in the interwar period, many of them, including Gertrud Kolmar and Nelly Sachs, reconnected with their heritage in the face of Nazi persecution. In her works Kolmar conceptualized human existence within the context of all living beings; Sachs reconsidered the status of her own species in fundamental ways, considering human suffering along with the suffering of other beings. In the theoretical arena social and political approaches prevailed, but Elias Canetti included anthropological perspectives that gave his research on mass psychology and power trans-species perspectives. Under Nazi rule, Jewish women writers and intellectuals found themselves in double jeopardy. Jean Am?ry discusses the unique prob lems intellectuals faced in Nazi concentration camps (18-45). Women who did not conform to the gender roles of the dominant culture were exposed to additional hardships. Daniel Boyar?n, comparing the gender codes of Jewish and Gentile cultures, asserts that the ideal of "manli ness" for Jewish men and that of "femininity" for Jewish women be came the dominant Jewish pattern as late as the fin de si?cle, too late to be fully integrated into the dominant culture (184-85). Considering their precarious situation, it is not surprising that Jewish women authors write about issues of oppression with great sensitivity. Many of them express a general disenchantment with patriarchy and with humanity. Often it seems that their views anticipate or transcend contemporary animal lib eration and animal-rights advocacy. Animal-rights proponents, in turn, often point to Nazi science and the Holocaust to support their argu ments. Arguing along similar lines as Elaine Scarry, who describes war as a "member of a class of occurrences whose activity is 'injuring'" human beings (56), animal-rights advocates focus on the acts of maiming and killing to draw parallels between violations of the human body by the Nazis and contempt for nonhuman bodies in contemporary Western society.2 They argue that the exploitation and slaughter involved in fac tory farming and animal experimentation resemble Nazi practices, such as breeding projects, forced labor, and medical experiments in concen tration camps. In his pioneering publication Animal Liberation, Peter Singer states: You cannot write objectively about the experiments of the Nazi concentration camp "doctors" on those they considered "sub human" without stirring emotions; and the same is true of a</page><page sequence="4">204 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination description of some of the experiments performed today on non humans in laboratories in America, Britain, and elsewhere (iii). The connection between the infliction of pain and the exercise of power that Singer establishes in bold strokes is also central to postmodern liter ature on power, e.g., Gayatri C. Spivak's reexamination of feminist the ory in terms of ethics and politics. Scarry observes: "Fraudulent and merciless, this kind of power claims pain's attributes as its own and dis claims the pain itself. The act of disclaiming is as essential to the power as the act of claiming. The first inflicts the pain, then objectifies the pain, then denies the pain" (56). Judith Butler problematizes the issue further by revealing links between social identity, prohibition, and injury (104). Foregrounding animal-rights concerns in his discussion of the abuse of power, Bernhard E. Rollin draws the following parallels between genocide and the destruction of animals: But why does intelligence score highest? Ultimately, perhaps, because intelligence allows us to control, vanquish, dominate, and destroy all other creatures. If this is the case, it is power that puts us on top of the pyramid. But if power provides grounds for in cluding or excluding creatures from the scope of moral concern, we have essentially accepted the legitimacy of the thesis that "might makes right" and have, in a real sense, done away with all morality altogether. If we do accept this thesis, we cannot avoid extending it to people as well, and it thus becomes perfectly moral for Nazis to exterminate Jews, muggers to prey on old people, the majority to oppress the minority and the government to do as it sees fit to any of us (30-31). Aware of the conceptual problems Rollin tried to come to terms with in 1992, Butler includes in her examination of suffering, identity, and power the point of view of the injured parties. She notes that power acts in at least two ways: as that which makes the subject possible and as that which is taken up and reiterated in the "subject's own acting" (14). It is precisely the use of the concept "subject" in Butler's postmodern femi nist argument that limits the parameters of her inquiry: beings denied subject status and inaccessible in their subjectivity because of their in ability to use human speech are automatically excluded from her criti cism. Observing that the term "animal" is applied both to "oyster and primate," i.e., to beings that bear less resemblance to one another than homo sapiens does to other mammals, Singer questions the usefulness of</page><page sequence="5">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 205 the standard scientific and philosophical classifications altogether (iii). Following a similar line of reasoning, Rollin concludes that scientific ideology must be shown up for what it is: bad philosophy. In the first place, science is neither value-free nor free of ethical judgment. Indeed, the very notion of what will count as a fact, as a legitimate object of investigation, or as data relevant to a given question, rests squarely on valuational presuppositions (61). Animal-rights advocates and feminists agree that the term "man" in the broader sense (Mensch) defines the position of power that humans arrogate over nonhuman life and matter. In the narrower sense (Mann) it implies dominance over women, children, and low-status males. According to Birke, who links feminist and animal-rights issues, regard less of which notion of animal we use, "it is always a construction (just as 'woman' is a construction)." Birke notes that ideas about "animals and their role(s) in relation to (Western) society" have changed in ac cordance with the needs and priorities of human society (42). The dual ism of "man" and "animal," rather than describing reality, defines a hierarchy that privileges (hu)man interest. Whoever is assigned the position of "animal" because of an alleged deficiency in human charac teristics, such as speech or intelligence, can be made available as food, as raw material, as an object for laboratory experimentation or for hunt ing. One only needs to remember that well into the eighteenth century it was accepted practice in Europe to hunt Gypsies for sport. In secularized Christian cultures the concept "animal" signifies the radically Other whose life, except for the purpose of supporting human activity, has no a priori worth. Harm to animals warrants no protest, and those that are not considered property may be eliminated with impunity.3 Bolstered by religion, science, and philosophy, this practice has become so ingrained that alternative religious, cultural, or ethical models strike most Westerners as absurd. Although for different rea sons, Hindus, whose religion prescribes vegetarianism, Buddhists, who believe in the essential sameness of the substance of all beings, and defenders of animal rights (as distinct from the humane treatment of animals) hold values alien to the dominant Western cultures that defend the consumption of meat and the utilitarian use of animals. Tom Regan criticizes what he terms the radical anti-empiricism of Ren? Descartes, the claim that "despite appearances to the contrary, they [animals] are not aware of anything, neither sights nor sounds, smells nor tastes, heat nor cold; they experience neither hunger nor thirst, fear nor rage, pleasure nor pain" (3). Regan notes that likening animals to clocks, Descartes concedes that the clocks are able to do</page><page sequence="6">206 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination some things better than human beings?a clock can keep better time?yet Descartes holds that animals, like clocks, are not conscious. The Cartesian paradigm invalidated earlier concepts of reality still reflected in fables and fairy tales: in medieval times, only twenty to twenty-five generations ago, moral agency was attributed to animals, notwithstand ing their inability to use human speech.4 Moreover, Francione asserts that even in today's Western societies, the notion that animals are moral agents is invoked when to do so is in the public interest, notwithstanding the fact that this practice is incompatible with the supposed object status of animals. In recent years the conceptual basis of anthropomorphism has come increasingly under attack by a variety of critical schools, including utilitarians, moral and ethics philosophers (John Fisher, Robert McShea, James Sheehan, Morton Sosna, Paul Taylor), rights philosophers (Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Susan Finsen, and Lawrence Finsen), legal scholars (Gary Francione), feminists (Carol Adams, Joan Dunayer, Carol Gilli gan, Linda Attamucci, Lynda Birke), neo-Darwinists (Carl N. Degler), and environmentalists (Lawrence Johnson, James Sterba). Although animal-rights arguments emerge from different schools of thought and follow their own internal logic, all of them attack the Cartesian model and its derivatives. Critics working in different disciplines are revising the anthropocentric perspective upon which rest concepts such as the Great Chain of Being and Enlightenment as well as post-Enlightenment anthropology and biology. They expose the self-serving function of the categories "man" and "animal" and reveal that allegedly universal facts and data are tainted by human interest. However, anti-anthropocentric, pro-animal-rights discourses are by and large conducted in separation because of traditional disciplinary boundaries. Although they are disen chanted with the existing academic and social power structures, the writers, for their criticism to be effective, must nonetheless position themselves within the very paradigms they criticize (cf. Butler 4). A brief historical overview reveals that anthropocentrism is thor oughly entrenched in European culture and suggests the enormous obstacles that block non-speciest arguments. Sheehan and Sosna write that Aristotle, "the first great biologist," established the hierarchy of liv ing beings, "in which all creatures?beginning with human females were defined on a sliding scale that began with adult males" (28). In early Christianity the status of animals was further reduced: "Christians saw nothing godlike in acting like a beast (unlike the Greeks, where gods often took animal forms)." Rather, they believed that the devil often took animal form (Sheehan and Sosna 28). The effects of casting women as witches and depicting animals, such as cats, bats, rats, and</page><page sequence="7">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 207 crows, as witches' familiars, are evident in the medieval witch hunts and cat persecutions of the same era. In The Devil and the Jews Joshua Trachtenberg relates the vilification of women and Jews to their centu ries-long demonization and animalization, from the Middle Ages to the Nazi era. Franz Hippler's film Der Ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew), a prototypical example of Nazi propaganda, filmed in 1939 in the ghetto of Lodz, identified vermin and Jews visually and discursively by first showing a panicked mass of rats and then crowds of destitute imprisoned Jews, accompanied by a voice-over suggesting that rats and Jews are identical. Both the demeaning representation of humans and the assumptions made about animals are reprehensible, Joan Dunayer argues. She deconstructs the act of animalizing humans and the underlying speciest assumptions in the following way: Rats are not "rats." While ingeniously resourceful, they will not use their quick intelligence to betray their familiars. Rat societies, in which serious fighting is an anomaly, exemplify peace and coop eration. Moreover, rats care for the helpless in their communities, such as the orphaned young and those too old to fend for them selves. Why the lies then? Why the contempt? With contemptuous words, humans establish and maintain emotional distance from other animals. This distance permits abuse without commensurate guilt (18). The objectification of animals in later scientific discourses is already evi dent in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, which defines animals as ingenious machines endowed with a sense of order to ensure the proper functioning of nature. Humans?men more so than women?are not considered to be in the thrall of instincts (Sheehan and Sosna 29). Birke concludes that "historically, ideas about animals and their role(s) in relation to (Western) society have inevitably changed as the needs and priorities of human society have changed" (42). Among feminists there has been a pervasive skepticism regarding established traditional intellectual categories. Cognizant of the ideologi cal implications of their respective discipline, some have linked their concerns with concerns about other species. Carol J. Adams, who dedicated The Sexual Politics of Meat (1990) to the "six billion each year, 16 million each day, 700,000 each hour, 11,500 each minute," draws attention to the analogies between the treatment of animals and of women as consumer goods and objects of pornography and violence. In "Woman-Battering and Harm to Animals" she reveals links between violent and terrorist acts against women and children and animal abuse:</page><page sequence="8">208 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination "Recognizing harm to animals as interconnected to controlling behavior by violent men is one aspect of recognizing the interrelatedness of all violence in a gender hierarchical world" (80).5 To make the manipulative function of the traditional distinction between human and nonhuman animals transparent, Susanne Kappeler shifts her perspective from the objectified victims to the subjects and perpetrators: [T]he naming of violence after its victims?as the sexual violence against women, the sexual abuse of children, the enslavement of black people, the present-day racism against black people and the people of the Third World, the anti-Semitism directed at the Jews, and also the oppression and the exploitation of animals and of nature?may all too easily lead us to compartmentalize oppressions and conceive of them as separate phenomena, thus setting up a competition between oppressions (321). Kappeler suggests focusing on "the common factors of power"and the intersections of different oppressions in order to expose the "accumula tion of power in the hands of those whose interests are being served by all forms of oppression." It is precisely "the possibility that most op pressed groups have of sharing (however unequally) in the profits from the oppression of others" that "breaks the solidarity between different oppressed groups and corrupts our will to join in resistance against all oppression" (323). * * * In the debates about animal rights and animal liberation, literary works have received relatively little attention. Yet, literature can provide insights into the emotional ramifications of these issues in a unique way. Frequently authors of what Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari term "minor literature," including Franz Kafka and Alice Walker, have held the ideologies of the dominant environment up to criticism. Kafka includes in his texts images and characters of animals that undermine the dominant culture and phallocentric writing. His texts often foil tradi tional notions about species, ethnicity, gender, and humanity, as for example "Schakale und Araber" ("Jackals and Arabs"), "Josefine, die S?ngerin oder das Volk der M?use" ("Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk"), "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis") and "Be richt an eine Akademie" ("A Report to an Academy"). Klaus Theweleit argues that Kafka made the decision to write "from the 'position of the dead,'" thereby bringing about a radical subversion of patriarchal production: "It [death] was already directed against</page><page sequence="9">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 209 himself toward the end of the case Kafka/[Felice] Bauer," Theweleit writes in allusion to Elias Canetti's interpretation of the Kafka/Bauer correspondence as a trial (1013). In social and philosophical terms the "position of the dead" signifies the position of ultimate powerless ness?that of animals and property, and, in many societies, past and contemporary, that of slaves, women, and children. The process of empowerment outlined by Butler corresponds with Kafka's point of view: "Only by occupying?being occupied by?that injurious term can I resist and oppose it, recasting the power that constitutes me as the power I oppose" (Butler 104). The maneuvers of achieving agency described by Butler are not, however, available to nonhuman animals and do not affect the circum stances of persons denied moral consideration. In fact, in social terms the denial of such consideration is tantamount to death. As is the case with farm and game animals, their general death sentence has already been passed. In the Holocaust era this was the situation of Jews under Nazi rule. German-speaking exile authors, survivors, and children of survivors wrote without any hope of changing their fate in order to expose the ideology that condoned the particular abuse of power that was threatening their very existence. The extraordinary position certain writers of the Holocaust era, both men and women, accord animals in their texts has rarely been acknowl edged. Yet, the failure to address these aspects obscures the authors' in tellectual achievement overall and the actual degree of their dissent. For the most part, in keeping with old clich?s, exclusively humanist interests are ascribed to these writers. Strangely enough, scholars expect authors who were treated with inhumanity by members of their own species to regard mankind as the pinnacle of creation. Another assumption scholars often make is that Holocaust writers denounce man's inhumanity to man as the ultimate transgression against human or divine law, as is indeed the case with many prominent authors such as Elie Wiesel and Erich Fried, authors who did not lose their faith in humanity or in God. Other authors, however, view the human race with profound skep ticism, even cynicism. Among them are Gertrud Kolmar, Paul Celan, Ilse Aichinger, Jean Am?ry, Jakov Lind, and Edgar Hilsenrath, none of whom endorses the optimistic Enlightenment belief in the basic goodness and perfectibility of mankind. Rather, they expose the ineffectiveness of humanist morality, which has failed to offer a remedy for the most blatant abuses of power, including genocide. In analogy to Isaac Bashe vis Singer's assertion that there will be no end of war until there is an end of the slaughter of animals, they draw attention to the body as the primary site of suffering, concentrating on the physical aspects of life</page><page sequence="10">210 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination and the processes that have traditionally been characterized as man's animal nature. Most notably, Kolmar, Walter Benjamin's favorite cousin, who was murdered in Auschwitz, included animals in the spec trum of suffering and focused on the body as the site of pain, showing that the effects of torture are identical for human and nonhuman ani mals. From this point of view Kolmar deconstructs the dualism of "man" and "animal." Like Kolmar, Elias Canetti, the 1981 Nobel Prize recipient for literature, expresses intense compassion with animals throughout his work. However, scholars steer clear of his statements concerning animals or interpret them in ways that do not do justice to Canetti's profound lament over the loss of animal life and his yearning for love and intimacy between human beings and animals: "I have not embraced a single animal. My entire life I have thought about animals with torment and compassion, but I have not embraced a single animal" (Aufzeichnungen 480). Likewise, Edgar Hilsenrath who survived the Holocaust in a Ro manian ghetto, undermines the body-mind (soul) dualism on which the animal-man division is based. His portrayal of human beings?ghetto prisoners in his novel Nacht and victims of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians in Das M?rchen vom letzten Gedanken (The Story of the Last Thought)?is body-centered but focused on the human sphere. Kolmar, on the other hand, crosses the species lines and establishes a literary voice that speaks both as a human being and as an animal. Among contemporary authors, Rahel Hutmacher dismantles the human-centered perspective in the most radical terms, portraying human beings in a global ecological context as one life form among many, and a highly destructive one at that. Her anti-humanist stance shows distinct affinities to Ilse Aichinger who, in turn, had great admiration for Nelly Sachs and Paul Celan. Traditionally, the significance of the animal characters and themes in these authors' oeuvre has been underrated. Their literary discourse unravels the ideology that informed the curricula of the Humanistische Gymnasien and German and Austrian universities, institutions that indoc trinated privileged students with an anthropocentric, patriotic male supremacist agenda. Not coincidentally, Jewish authors, who were the targets of gentile hostility, authored much of the literature undermining anthropocentrism. Many of them had suffered through their high school years, while others received their education outside the public school system. Since the turn of the century the high school and university cur ricula included racial studies; in the Weimar Republic Hans G?nther's Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (The Racial Elements of the German Nation) was regarded as a scientific work. Unable to embrace the</page><page sequence="11">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 211 bourgeois Bildungsideal and exposed to everyday antisemitism, many Jewish authors felt alienated from the dominant culture; their experi ences and views were, in fact, excluded from the German cultural narra tives. Walter Benjamin, for example, notes that history is always written by the conquerors. In postwar Czechoslovakia, Milan Kundera extended Benjamin's insight to include the animal point of view: "Genesis was written by a man, not a horse. There is no certainty that God actually did grant man domination over other creatures" (286). * * * Gertrud Kolmar was estranged from her environment already as a young woman, and her sense of isolation escalated during the Nazi era when she wrote her poetry cycle Die Frau und die Tiere (The Woman and the Animals) (Woltmann 199-208). In it, Kolmar exposes the rhetorical circle that degrades animals for the purpose of vilifying hu man beings and vice versa. She writes with empathy afbout the most despised animals, vindicating both them and her human speakers, many of whom are women or Jews, or both. Other Jewish women authors stated anti-humanist positions from different perspectives, through themes and characters or in cursory comments, as exemplified by Veza Canetti's sardonic remark at the end of the novel Die gelbe Stra?e (Yellow Street): "For the human being has an upright stride, and the sublime features of the soul are burned into his face" (168). In Das Hebr?erland (Land of the Hebrews) Else Lasker-Sch?ler recorded with outrage the abuse of animals during her exile in Palestine; Alice Schwarz-Gardos's novel Die Abrechnung (The Day of Reckoning) is permeated by a passionate engagement on behalf of animals, especially cats; and Claire G?ll set some of her later prose exclusively among ani mals and attributed emotions and sensations to them, for example in Die Taubenwitwe (The Widow of the Dove). Her narrative strategies resem ble those Karla Armbruster identifies as effective in expressing "environ mental advocacy." Kolmar's work abounds with gestures of "becoming animal" similar to the ones Deleuze and Guattari observe in Kafka's work as an expression of "absolute deterritorialization" (13). As in Kaf ka's case, for Kolmar deterritorialization implies the radical decon struction of the patriarchal hierarchy and a revision of the concept of humanity. Kolmar's critique of the oppression and colonization of Jewish soci ety in the twentieth century is most apparent in the novella Susanna, which reaches beyond the German context. Both Kolmar and Benjamin problematize civilization, showing it to be the product of acts of</page><page sequence="12">212 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination barbarism, and denounce the silencing of the victims. Fundamentally challenging the Cartesian model, Kolmar counts animals among the oppressed and she exposes the problematic foundations of secular Judeo Christian civilization, contrasting it with the Kabbalistic view of the world embodied by her protagonist Susanna. In her examination of the culture of the Weimar era, including aspects of Nazi ideology, Kolmar resorts to an archaic Jewish model that assumes no split between body and spirit and validates female desire, of which her protagonist repre sents the very essence. By exposing the restrictiveness of modern, gentile-inspired gender roles, Kolmar characterizes "the 'emancipation' of the Jews" as being "functionally akin to a colonization" (Boyar?n 280). Her strong female characters are defeated by their assimilationist and non-Jewish environments, whereas they might have thrived in traditional Jewish culture, which, according to Boyar?n, "exhort[ed] men to be more like women" (124). Kolmar, herself a victim of early twentieth-century race and gender norms, resisted the paradigms that sanctioned the elimination of the powerless, the disabled, Jews, women, and animals. To be sure, her views did not arise in a vacuum. In addition to Benjamin's cultural criticism, they must be viewed in the context of philosophies calling for a radically egalitarian "reverence for life," such as that advocated by Albert Schweitzer, Kolmar's contempo rary (Civilization and Ethics 5). Susanna, written during the 1930s, is set in an exclusively Jewish environment. Racism and prejudice against the disabled are presented as related issues, and the protagonist's perceptions erode species bound aries. The narrative frame relates to the threat of exile or extermination, while the main plot is set prior to the Nazi era, revealing that already before Nazi rule, Europeans, Jews, and gentiles had accepted views destructive to themselves and to each other. Jews about to fall victim to racism use racist language, women have become misogynists, and Jews discriminate against other Jews because of a perceived disability. Disability is synonymous with the loss of human rights: Susanna, because of her mental disability, and a young boy, her counterpart, because of his physical impairment, are denied a full life. Kolmar thematizes different types of prejudice underlying the social standard of normalcy that allowed eugenics and racial hygiene to flourish in the early twentieth century. These norms cause the demise of the beautiful, childlike Susanna and ultimately that of her governess. The latter, an assimilated Jew, accepts the assessment of her likewise assimilated employer that Susanna is not fit for married life and motherhood. A few years later, under Nazi rule, the governess finds herself disenfranchized.</page><page sequence="13">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 213 Susanna's vivid imagination clashes with the rationalist patterns of her environment. Characteristic of her perceptions is the blurring of species lines, for example, when she says about her dog Zoe: "'She is a bitch and a noblewoman, the Empress of Byzantium'" (Susanna 14), and about herself: "'But I am an animal.' She stated it calmly without smiling, in a manner a woman might state in a conversation about nationalities: But I am a Polish woman. Or: But I am a Dutch woman" (19) . At the same time Susanna characterizes herself as a "king's daughter," "a daughter of King David or King Saul" (20). The reaction of her educator reflects that of the larger society: "For the first time I felt the dread that overcomes us in the company of the mentally ill" (20) . Yet, Susanna has an inescapable influence on those around her. Later, the governess speaks of Zoe's "woman's eyes" (63) and, in the frame narrative, even attributes emotional reactions to her suitcases (7). Susanna's resistance to the ordering principles of modern Western culture calls to mind Kafka's Die Verwandlung, the concept of transfor mation in Canetti's Masse und Macht (Crowds and Power), and the metamorphoses in Hutmacher's Wildleute (Wild People). Kolmar's writing is inspired by physical experiences and a "feminist caring ethic," such as in the models defined by Carol J. Adams and Josephine Donovan with regard to animals (Animals and Women), and by Carol Gilligan and Jane Attanucci in the social context. Kolmar's ethical imperative combines both aspects of motherliness: the relation ship between mother and child and concern for animals. Insofar as Kol mar's animal characters reflect the author's experience of racist antisem itism and misogyny, they are metaphors. Yet, on a primary level, they express the author's regard for animals as her fellow creatures. Particularly Kolmar's later poetry, Weibliches Bildnis (Female Por trait), holds the pervasive disregard for life in twentieth-century German society up to criticism by portraying with shocking directness human cruelty toward socially weak persons and animals. While establishing parallels between the fate of Jews and that of animals, Kolmar looks at animals not only from the outside, as victims of hatred and cruelty, but tries to assume their point of view. Speaking for those who truly have no voice, she reveals their innate dignity, for example in the poem "Die Kr?te" : "Mag ich nur ekles Geziefer dir sein: / Ich bin die Kr?te / Und trage den Edelstein... " (Das lyrische Werk 159-60).6 Numerous poems are written entirely from the point of view of the animal and contain unconventional images of animals that are generally hated, thereby invalidating the prevalent human attitudes: "Ich durchschritt zierlich das h?lzerne Gatter,"7 Kolmar writes about a snake (Das lyrische Werk 161-62).</page><page sequence="14">214 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination Stripped of their rights, Jews in the Nazi death camps were treated as material, much like the animals in Kolmar's poem "Legende," in which a generic human male is visited by the ghosts of the dead animals whose bodies he has used in his daily environment (Das lyrische Werk 148-49). The man has made use of the hide, the wool, and the feathers of animals to decorate his living space. Similar to Benjamin in his remarks about civilizations and their historians, Kolmar makes transpar ent the cruelty that the man's lifestyle requires by juxtaposing his Western attitudes with Eastern paradigms. Similar to the Bhagavad-Gita, according to which the animals killed by humans wait to ingest their killers in a future life, Kolmar's dead animals hold the man accountable for their demise and demand satisfaction. In the man's nightmare, animal products such as down pillows transform themselves back into living animals: "Den kleinen fellgewirkten Teppich ri? / Der Wolf, ge schunden, h?utig, blutendrot, / Aufr?chelnd, zuckend mit gefletschtem Bi?: / Dies war mein Kleid! Und darum bin ich tot?"8 The concreteness of Kolmar's imagery is reminiscent of traditional Jewish texts where, as Howard Eilberg-Schwartz points out, animal and nature imagery play an important role (118). Kolmar writes in graphic detail about the destruc tion of the body prior to the Holocaust. The cruelty she reveals toward animals foreshadows the way human beings will soon treat each other. Kolmar seems to interpret man's sadism and mindless cruelty as a result of defects inherent in his species. In "Legende" his frailty is epitomized by his hairless body and psychological shortcomings. Kolmar's poem implies regret that the most helpless animal, man, has the upper hand because of his cunning and ruthlessness. Scarry reflects on the rationalization and desensitization that are necessary to produce a lifestyle such as that of the man in Kolmar's poem: " .. .if one were to object that the knife that cuts through the cow is a tool [rather than a weapon], the person would be someone who has retracted the privilege of sentience from the animal and thinks of the cow as already-food and therefore, not-quite-alive" (173). In Kolmar's vision of Judgment Day, mankind is put on trial for its transgressions. The jury consists of the animals it has destroyed ("Der Tag der gro?en Klage" [The Day of the Great Lamentation], Das lyrische Werk 167-68). In this poem, Kolmar disputes man's right to exploit other animals or to control nature. On the day of reckoning neither God the Father nor God the Son sits in judgment. Assuming that the poem contains a hint of a world-to-come as the one mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, in Kolmar's case the righteous who "will sit with crowns on their heads feasting on the radiance of the shekhina, the divine presence" (Telushkin 276) are animals.</page><page sequence="15">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 215 * * * Ilse Aichinger, who began publishing after the Holocaust, expanded Kolmar's non-anthropocentric positions to include empathy with inani mate objects. As does Nelly Sachs in Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israel (Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel), Aichinger develops an encompassing concept of reality. Her views resemble in certain aspects those of the environmental philosopher Paul Taylor, who calls for an "ethics of respect for nature" (95). There are also parallels between Aichinger's and Sachs's attentiveness to the phenomenological world and Lawrence E. Johnson's environmental ethics: "We live in a morally deep world. We are morally significant ourselves, and we live in a world of beings, on many different levels, that are morally sig nificant" (111). Aichinger's subversive poetic strategies reveal an on going struggle against the fascist legacy and postwar materialism. Like Kolmar she exalts the most despised animals. In her poem "Neuer Bund" (New Covenant), pigs dying in obscurity represent the highest level of integrity because they cannot be utilized for human purposes. Aichinger's image expresses profound admiration for nonhuman life: Und darum geh ich fort aus diesem Frieden, aus diesem lieben Frieden in den Schatten zu meinen lieben Schweinen, die allein grimmig und gelassen genug nach dem Gebote und nach den Geboten in unserem stumpfen Wasser zu ersticken wissen, die keine Sonne einholt und verdirbt, die obenauf erst nach dem Ende bleiben. Meine K?nige (Verschenkter Rat 77).9 The attitudes expressed by Aichinger and Kolmar coincide with Canetti's conviction that only death and killing are deserving of hatred (Die gerettete Zunge 11). Canetti's observation applies to all beings. Passionately interested in the welfare of animals, he is concerned about the desensitization of human feelings as a result of killing. Opposing views according to which one life form is inferior to another, Canetti condemns the subjugation and extermination of the Other under any circumstances. Many of his aphorisms revolve around the dire conse quences he foresees should most nonhuman animals be exterminated: "It</page><page sequence="16">216 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination could happen that they [humans] will be left behind in complete empti ness and destitution," he writes, and goes on to deplore that the ascent of the human species was not stopped (Aufzeichnungen 66). Considering the fate of animals and mankind as inextricably linked, Canetti assesses the long-range effects of anthropocentrism as follows: "In a thousand years: a small number of animals of very few species, rare and fawned upon like gods" (Aufzeichnungen 455). As do Kolmar and Aichinger, he questions the positive self-image humans have of their own species, as a result of which the future of all species is in jeopardy. Convinced of its own importance, humankind has failed or is unable to make the protection of all life its priority.10 None of the authors discussed here are optimistic about rights issues, whether they concern human or nonhuman animals; killing seems too much a part of their civilization. Looking beyond narrowly defined human interests, they advocate expanding the taboo against killing to include other species. Canetti associates killing and eating with power, mass murder, and survival, the very issues he associates with paranoid leaders and mass murderers, both of which he connects with the denial of human and animal rights. In Masse und Macht he links oppression, ingesting, and the status of animals. According to Canetti, whoever wants to dominate human beings will try to humiliate them, break their resistance, and take away their rights until they have become as power less as animals. "His final goal is to 'ingest' them and suck them dry. He does not care what will be left of them" (516). For Canetti the decisive distinction is not between man and animal but between predators and species that do not exploit and dominate others. Numerous statements m Aufzeichnungen (Notebooks), and espec ially the later ones in Das Geheimherz der Uhr (The Secret Heart of the Clock), undermine the dualism, as does the use of the word "friend" in the following aphorism: "You have not one single friend among the ani mals. Do you call that living?" (Aufzeichnungen 516). As early as 1935 in Die Blendung (Auto-da-F?) Canetti portrays the boundaries between the species as fluid and human identity as imaginary. Canetti writes here about a character who vacillates between man and ape. Similar to the ape in Kafka's "Bericht f?r eine Akademie," Canetti's creature is phys ically, emotionally, and intellectually involved both with the human and the animal sphere, thereby deconstructing the concepts of man and humanity. Kolmar and Canetti were of the same age group and the same general background, the educated European Jewish middle class, and they shared the experience of racist antisemitism and National Socialism. Witnessing the cataclysmic events of their age motivated them to explore alternative approaches to life for the sake of global survival. In the</page><page sequence="17">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 217 process they questioned practices that accommodate man's creature comforts and flatter him in his arrogance?the very arrogance that sent Kolmar to her death in Auschwitz.11 * * * In post-Shoah literature anti-humanist and zoomorphic views emerge especially strongly in the works of Rahel Hutmacher, who portrays ani mals, humans, and vegetation as participants in the same life processes. Her concept of reality also includes legendary and fantastic creatures. Generally, her narrators are positioned outside the human sphere, hence they perceive humans as members of a species rather than as individu als. Hutmacher's universe has permeable boundaries; within it there is little difference between humans, animals, plants, and inanimate objects. One of the episodes in Wildleute (Wild People), for example, involves a "wild woman" who wishes to marry a human man rather than the tree her father chose as her husband (86). This type of expanded reality allows for constellations and attitudes similar to those embraced by ecological feminists and postmodern environmental ethics. As Jim Cheney observes, "dismantling patriarchal discourse is not likely by itself to eliminate the forces of essentialization and totalization. " But, he goes on to assert, "a mythic, narrative, and bioregional construction of self and community.. .has a close affinity with, and relevance to, feminist attempts to deal with the fractured identities of multiple female voices in the wake of the deconstruction of patriarchal totalizing and essentializing discourse" (133). In addition to the nature/species discourse, Hutmacher's narratives include Jewish subtexts. The "wild people" in Wildleute, for example, can be interpreted as surrogate Jews (Lauckner). The relationships across species lines reflect also, but not exclusively, "the dialectic be tween Self and Other," as David Biale terms it, i.e., the interaction with a differently and more violently gendered society of the kind that Jews experienced with the surrounding Christian societies. For Jews, this con frontation is unavoidable in the modern world and, according to Biale, erotic relationships between Jews and non-Jews reflect and symbol ize the interaction between Jewish culture and the culture of those among whom Jews have lived. Jewish culture never evolved in a vacuum, but it was always the product of the form of interaction between Jewish and non-Jewish culture. Jews have always lived and participated in a multicultural world (230). For Hutmacher the issue at hand is not only multiculturalism, but also multispeciesm.</page><page sequence="18">218 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination Like Canetti in Masse und Macht, Hutmacher also works with alter native cultural models, e.g., Native American or African customs, where it is not uncommon for animals to be guides, teachers, and friends. The motif of transformation suggests possibilities of inter species communication. Hutmacher, like Canetti, acknowledges that the earth is a closed system. She writes from a position of zoomorphism that calls to mind the assertion made by Kolmar's Susanna: "Ich bin doch ein Tier" (But I am an animal). Indeed, Hutmacher's protagonists also try to speak with the voices of those who lack human speech, and they em brace the Otherness to which women, animals, and nature were rele gated in the European tradition. From the point of view of the Other, Hutmacher establishes radically anti-authoritarian and anti-patriarchal positions. In her works, they constitute the ethical and conceptual norm. Numerous other contemporary women authors proceed in a similar fashion. Many of them are descendants of survivors and Nazi victims, such as Katja Behrens and Marie-Th?r?se Kerschbaumer. The authors discussed here are part of a larger spectrum of writers concerned with the issues of equal respect and concern for human and nonhuman life. Their writings call for sympathy for animals, which, as Fisher argues, is "as appropriate and justified as sympathy for humans" (243). Moreover, they warn, as do contemporary philosophers and scientists, that human survival is contingent upon the survival of nonhu man animals and not vice versa. Kolmar, Aichinger, Canetti, and Hutmacher point toward this very interdependence, strongly endorsing an attitude of care for all living beings.12 In the same vein, the environ mentalist and animal-rights proponent Paul Taylor notes that the possibility of the extinction of the human species.. .which starkly confronts the contemporary world, makes us aware of an other respect in which we should not consider ourselves privileged beings in relation to other species. This is the fact that the well being of humans is dependent upon the ecological soundness and health of many plant and animal communities, while their sound ness and health does not in the least depend upon human well being. Indeed, from their standpoint the very existence of humans is quite unnecessary. Every last man, woman, and child could disappear from the face of the earth without any significant detri mental consequence for the good of wild animals and plants (107).</page><page sequence="19">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 219 Notes Unless otherwise noted, translations are my own. 1 R.G. Willis writes: "Since Descartes, nonhuman animals have been conventionally classified as belonging entirely to the material side of that grand cosmological divide, and only humans participate in it, by virtue of their possession of material and mortal bodies, as well as immortal spirits" (8). 2 Focusing on the body, Elaine Scarry characterizes torture in the following terms: "(1) the infliction of pain (2) the objectification of the sub jective attributes of pain (3) the translation of the objectified attributes of pain into the insignia of power" (56). This assessment reads similar to descriptions by animal-rights advocates of laboratory experiments involving animals. 3 Gary Francione comments: "Even if we take animal interests seri ously, our treatment of animals is unlikely to improve as long as we regard animals as property of human owners_ An alternative legal status for animals in which they would no longer be regarded as property would probably entail dramatic economic and social consequences, given that our economy is heavily dependent on the level of animal exploitation protected by legal welfarism. Therein lies the intractable nature of the present contro versy" (261). According to Francione, pigs were the most commonly prosecuted animals because they were thought to be most easily possessed by the devil. He explains the reasons for the criminal prosecution of animals by the principle of retaliation and the fact that the animal was considered an agent, although, generally speaking, the trial and execution of animals was a legal anomaly (92-94). 4 Stephen R.L. Clark cites trials against animals accused of heresy or suits against dogs charged with criminal offenses. These instances character ize an earlier mind set that Clark refuses to reject offhand: "If beasts have no conception of Cartesian selves that is to their credit. I can see no reason why they, and human infants, may not have a pre-verbal concept of the beings that they are, distinct from others and from the environment, and having policies that are all their own (however short-term)" (47). 5 Similar analogies exist in the case of antisemitic acts of terror. The Nazis did not allow Jews to own pets. In ghettos and concentration camps, there were neither animals nor vegetation. When Jewish communities in Eastern Europe were destroyed, their animals were often killed as well. 6 "To you I may be disgusting vermin: / But I am the toad / And carry the gemstone_" 7 "Nimbly I ambled through the wooden gate."</page><page sequence="20">220 The Discourse of Exclusion and Discrimination 8 "The wolf tore the small fur-woven carpet / Flayed, skinned, bleeding-red, / Gasping, spastic, his teeth bared / That was my coat! Am I dead because of it?" 9 "For this reason I remove myself from / this peace / this beloved peace / into the shade / to my beloved pigs / the only ones / wrathful and serene enough / in keeping with the commandment / and in keeping with the commandments / to know how to suffocate in our dull water / with whom no sun catches up / to spoil them / who only after the end remain on top. / My kings." Claudine Fabre-Vassas argues that Christian legends "reaffirm the association between the Jew...and the animal he judges unclean." Although in Christian discourse the Jew and pig have become interlinked, while from a Jewish point of view the pig, notably its meat, is excluded from the Jewish sphere, it is a signifier of difference in both instances. Fabre-Vassas writes that "the pig, with its shady origins" and its meat proclaim "the difference of Christians, the Christian par excellence" (94). 10 This line of reasoning coincides with Richard A. Watson's argument that treating animals as machines will lead to treating humans the same way. Thus, "whether or not animals are machines, we should treat them as though they are not. We should act as though animals have rights to comfortable lives, very like human rights, to avoid the possibility that some people will treat humans as Cartesians propose we treat animals" (12-13). 11 I do not believe that the Jewish experience under the Nazis led by necessity to a reassessment of the status of human beings nor that it gener ated a new sensitivity regarding the fate of animals. Reexaminations of the Enlightenment legacy, such as Horkheimer's and Adorno's Dialektik der Aufkl?rung, do not problematize speciesm. Neither do their critics. Jeffrey Herf, for example, regrets that the Enlightenment project was not taken to its full consequence. Anti-speciest views derived from other experiences, including that of being a woman, e.g., Marlen Haushofer's Die Wand, a novel about a woman who survives a global catastrophe, becomes the matriarch of animal survivors, and kills the last surviving human male. 12 Mary Anne Warren states that the homocentric (human-centered) view of morality is currently challenged from seemingly disparate directions (185). According to her the environmentalist and the animal liberationist perspectives are complementary (206).</page><page sequence="21">Dagmar CG. Lorenz 221 Works Cited Adams, Carol J.
