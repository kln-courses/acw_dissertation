<plain_text><page sequence="1">A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN CHINA By K. S. Latourette The Macmillan Company, New York, 1929. G$5.O0 This voluminous history of 930 pages by the Professor of Mis- sions and Oriental History in Yale University is of an interest more particular than most histories of the East written by sons of the West. For it is a history of the activities of a certain section of Western humanity in the East, a record of emotions and faiths and the confusion of other psychological promptings which offered the group and its ideal an implementation quite other than that of the more familiar games of trade and diplomacy and warfare. But because the desired conquest in this field struck most deeply at the fundamental cultural and spiritual life of the nation, and implied a radical alteration in the traditional modes of the people, its history is of as great importance to the Chinese as to foreigners. For this reason, then, we believe that PACIFIc A1VAIRS readers will be more interested to know how a modern Chinese writer, a non-Chris- tian, has reviewed this book, than to know what we ourselves think of it. We reprint from a comprehensive review by Quentin Pan, one of the Associate Editors of the China Critic, Shanghai, appearing in that journal for April 11, 1929. Mr. Pan said in part: But Professor Latourette's book is an unusually valuable contribution for other obvious reasons than its comprehensiveness and the fact that it fills a need long felt. It is far more than a mere com- pendium; it contains a wealth and a variety of painstakingly gathered and carefully sifted materials, to which the ordinary student of Chris- tian missions, not to say the general reader, can have little or no access. In point of variety, it may be further noted that the History is not merely one of Christian missions as evangelical bodies, but at once one which traces the development, in modern China, of medical and sanitary work, of the modern educational system, and- of western ideas and attitudes in many fields of social and intellectual endeavor; for these, wittingly or otherwise, have all been closely bound up with the mission- ary enterprise. Even in the field of politics, beginning with the wars that ended in the conclusion of many unequal treaties, through the Tai Ping insurrection, the Revolution of 1911, and down even to the political fortunes of many national leaders of the day, results are in many ways traceable to missionary influences. "While nobody can be sure of the future of the Christian missions in China, and while our author sees fit not to say much about it, he seems nevertheless quite optimistic and at times even sanguine about the enterprise. The optimism, however, does not seem to be well founded, for two important reasons. . . . These are, in brief, that the Christian conception of God is one of refined anthropomorphism,</page><page sequence="2">PACIFIC AFFAIRS 371 and does not tally with the prosaic common sense of the average Chi- nese; and that the ideal of the brotherhood of men, in ignoring the natural principle of diminishing emotional attachment to persons within and without the family, tends to foster shallow sentimentalism rather than genuine good will, and hence is also opoosed to our traditional ethical standards. . . . But there is one difficulty with which our author does deal, and that is, that so far the Christian religion has failed to induce into its fold the scholarly and intellectual elements of the country. But even here, he seems to have been rather reticent about presenting the whole case, or else he seems to have quite underestimated the difficulty. He does not, for instance, go into any careful search as to why Christianity has so far failed to attract the scholarly. That it is exotic and is opposed to traditional modes of thought certainly will not explain in these latter days of missionary experience when all tra- ditional barriers are being rapidly razed. More explanatory is perhaps the fact, which Christians will not own, that Christianity lacks any profound system of metaphysics such as possessed by Buddhism, to which the intelligentsia of the country very readily betook themselves even in the early days of its introduction. . "But when all is said, the fact remains that Professor Latourette, in preparing this book, has rendered an unprecedented piece of service for which missionary workers and Christian students will remain for years indebted. Even those readers who are interested in Christian missions only in a general cultural way will find the book a veritable fountain, from which materials for the study and appreciation of cultural con- tact, conflict, and intermingling may be freely drawn."</page></plain_text>
