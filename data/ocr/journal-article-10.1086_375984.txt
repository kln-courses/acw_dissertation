      <p>That this volume has appeared is a labor of love by colleagues on behalf of an elderly professor who spent years working through the technical details of ancient to Renaissance celestial mechanics. Armed with a solid command of languages, he produced a guide that might have been particularly helpful in the days before Gerald Toomer’s definitive translation of the <italic>Almagest,</italic> O. Neugebauer’s <italic>History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,</italic> William Donahue’s English version of Kepler’s <italic>Astronomia nova,</italic> or N. M. Swerdlow and Neugebauer’s treatise on the mathematical astronomy of Copernicus. None of these works figure in the quaintly dated bibliography that assisted the present work.</p>
      <p>What we have here are tidy diagrams, modern equations and accurate geometry, old‐fashioned historiography supported by strong opinions (such as how queer Plato was, with his “orgy of anthropomorphic, metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic judgements that are scientifically irrelevant” [p. 29]), and essentially no significant insights. The book was obviously not written for historians of science, and to the professionals it can only be considered an embarrassment. Yet Jacobsen does say, apropos of an earlier opinion that Kepler’s reputation would have been higher if he had burned three quarters of his work, that “this remark reveals a deplorable ahistorical viewpoint and reminds one of the narrow judgement of some of the French encyclopedists, who, intoxicated with perspectives gained during the Age of Reason, … exhibited the smallness of mind to accuse Kepler of being a ‘scatterbrained mystic’” (p. 172).</p>
      <p>There are, very occasionally, small errors in the text, such as the statement that Hipparchus had discovered the effect of evection in the lunar motion through the timing of eclipses; since this is an anomaly absent at syzygies, the claim must be wrong. Almost universally Ptolemy is credited with the discovery of evection. Furthermore, Ptolemy found its amplitude to be right on the modern value, contrary to the value Jacobsen gives. One must assume, however, that the numerous equations that appear throughout his book are correct, as it would be a thankless task to prove otherwise.</p>
