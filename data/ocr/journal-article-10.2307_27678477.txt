<plain_text><page sequence="1">St Augustine Thomas Finan I In this season sixteen hundred years ago Aurelius Augustinus was baptized by Bishop Ambrose in his cathedral church in Milan, at the Easter ceremonies of 24-25 April 387. Together with Augustine his life-long friend Alypius, future Bishop of Thagaste, Augustine's birthplace. With them also Augustine's natural son, Adeodatus, 'carnally begotten by me in my sin'. The event was the end of a long search by a man who was born into the Faith, became a troubled questioning adolescent, a disaf fected university intellectual, joined the more 'scientific'-seeming sect of the Manicheans, eventually saw through them too, dallied then with sceptical despair of ever finding philosophic and religious truth, returned to the Catholic Church as a provisional catechumen - 'until some certain light should appear by which I might steer my course' - became a reborn Christian in August, and presented him self as a candidate for baptism in the following March at the beginning of Lent. 'In my beginning is my end.' This was the man who, no matter how unhappy with orthodoxy, could never be happy with any 'doxa' that excluded Christ. 'Any book that lacked his name, no matter how learned and excellently written, could never win me. completely' (Conf. 3.4). The baptism he now received he had already begged when he once fell gravely ill as a child. But when he suddenly got well again his mother postponed it to adult years, after a custom of the time. 'I was then a believer, as was my mother, and all our household except my father' (Conf. 1.11). In retrospect Augustine was critical of his mother's decision. Baptism, he believed, would have saved him from 'the many mighty waves of temptation' that were about to break over him as he grew out of boyhood. If he had been so saved we should now know a lot less about the grande profundum, the great deep that is man. We should lack one of the great books of the world, Thomas Finan is a priest of the diocese of Killala and Professor of Ancient Classics at St Patrick's College, Maynooth. This is the fourth article in The Furrow 1987 series 'Saints Alive'.</page><page sequence="2">294 THE FURROW Augustine's Confessions. We should be without all the spoils of 'wisdom' that the exile brought back from 'Egypt'. In a word we should be without one of the great exemplars of man's spiritual Odyssey. Now at last 'we were baptized, and all anxiety about our past fled away. The days were not long enough as I meditated ... on the depth of your design for the salvation of the human race. I wept at the beauty of your hymns and canticles . . . Those sounds flowed into my ears, and the truth streamed into my heart: so that my feel ing of devotion overflowed, and the tears ran from my eyes, and I was happy in them' (Conf. 9.6). No baptism since that of St Paul was more momentous for the history of Christianity. And not for Christianity only but also for the civilization it leavened, or created. For the teeming heart and mind of this Church Father made him also one of a few ever fruitful fathers of philosophic thought and its search for truth. II Who is this man and what can he say to us sixteen centuries on? By birth a North African. Southern shore of the age-old Mediter ranean gravitationl centre of the movement of races and civiliza tions. Of Roman settler stock. A stock that could discipline but not suppress the indigenous influence of geography, climate and race, aboriginal Berber race and colonizing Semitic Phoenician before the Roman came. The influence that produced the characteristic African temper, the furor Africanas that we know from its Latin writers, pagan and Christian. Born at Thagaste, Souk Ahras in modern Algeria. Into a small-town 'ascendancy' family of limited means in hard times. Of a pious, pushful mother, Monica, and an earthy pagan father, Patricius. Provincial circumstances from which it will be the first ambition of the young and upwardly mobile Augustine to escape - to Carthage and imperial Rome and Milan. To return reborn into a new world-view. The greatest of many representatives of an age in which a world was passing away and another being painfully born. Son then of an ancient flourishing province of Rome - as Empire and Church. A man of the ancient civilization - who yet has earned the clich? of 'the first modern man'. His life (354-430) coincided with the last stages of the decline and fall of Rome. If that be 'ancient history' to know it is to realize about much of our own experience that we have been there before. He knew the inflation, taxation, economic decay and restrictions of personal freedom that were the internal symptoms of Roman decline. He knew the sack of the 'eternal city' in 410, an event that, even to Christians, looked like the end of the world. As he lay on his death-bed the Vandal</page><page sequence="3">SAINT AUGUSTINE 295 fleet was blockading his episcopal city of Hippo. He prayed for one or other of two favours. To be called away before they got in, otherwise for the strength to endure what men must. He was granted the former. In those last days his 'dialogue of comfort against tribulation' was with certain of the Psalms of David hung on the wall in front of him, and with a thought from Plotinus, Greek philosopher and mystic. 'He will be no great man who thinks it a matter of great importance that timber and stone should collapse and mortal men should die.' Ill But Augustine saw that the soul had left the ancient body politic long before its physical collapse. And far from that collapse being due to the triumph of religion and barbarism (in Gibbon's gibe) he saw religion as the soul of the true City. And even then ... all civilizations are mortal. Only the City of God is 'eternal'. His work of that title was occasioned by the need to reflect on the cataclysm of 410. It is one of the 'great books' of civilization. It is the first philosophy, or more correctly theology, of history. History no longer interpreted from the limited viewpoint of Rome or Athens but from the viewpoint of the heavenly Jerusalem, sub specie aeter nitatis. A viewpoint that could only be given from beyond history, from the Alpha and Omega given in the Judeo-Christian revela tion. From this glimpse of the world of Augustine and the holistic range of the questions for which Christianity was to be the 'true philosophy' (as the early Christians called their religion) it is easy to see how far beyond the individual and personal were the implica tions of Augustine's conversion. He is the most voluminous as well as the most powerful intellectual and spiritual force among the Latin Fathers. His range is the range of truth, revealed truth and the truth of philosophical reason in so far as it is necessary to understand as well as believe. This range is also the range of his own searching genius. It is the range of the vertical drive of his metaphysical tempera ment. Augustine is one of those peak representatives of man's con dition who have been called pilgrims of the absolute. Because their spirits are restless until they rest in an absolute, some final insight into the origin and purpose of existence. Augustine's first 'conver sion' was an intellectual conversion. In his nineteenth year, to the philosophical search for 'deathless wisdom' (i.e. the old high sapiential quest for sophia, common to Jew and Greek). Wisdom not in the confused cackle of competing philosophical schools, but 'Wisdom itself, wherever it might be' (Conf. 3.4). The drive of such pilgrims usually has a religious dimension. In</page><page sequence="4">296 THE FURROW such men it is the heart as well as the reason that is in search of satisfaction. After the Bible and Plato, and anticipating Pascal, Augustine is also a philosopher of the heart. He anticipates Newman in 'the thought of two and two only supreme and luminously self-evident beings, myself and my creator' (Apologia). 'My longing is to know God and to know my soul' (Soliloquies). He anticipates Pascal on the 'fire' and the 'joy' of knowing the 'God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and savants.' The leitmotiv of the Confessions is that 'thou hast made us towards thyself and our hearts are restless until they rest in thee' (1.1). The grande profundum, the 'great deep' of man, is his longing and capacity for the infinity of God. Augustine was always a God-tormented man. Long before he could resolve his intellectual difficulties about God's nature, God's existence was a haunting 'interior melody', towards which he strained the ears of his heart. The eventual finding of God is not the finding of one compart ment al truth among others in the general search for truth. God is the source both of reality and the light by which it is understood. He is the principium, the 'beginning', the One Truth on which all partial truths depend. The metaphysical 'convert' of nineteen did not know it at the time, but 'I had begun that journey upwards by which I was to return to you' (Conf. 3.4). Augustine is a philosophic mind, driven by the need to under stand as well as believe. Yet one of his favourite texts and funda mental principles is that 'unless you believe you will not understand' (Isaiah 7:9 LXX). (No cheap principle, but one with its own philosophic validity, as Augustine knew.) God's word then became the 'true philosophy'. 'Marvellous is the profundity of thy scriptures. Their surface lies open to us, charming us as we charm children. But marvellous is their profundity, O my God, marvellous is their profundity. To gaze into it is a shuddering, the shudder of awe, the shudder of love' (Conf. 11.14). And when the historical and philological exegetes objected that the sacred writers could not have been conscious of all that Augustine found in their words the principle of his answer was that 'if I myself had to write with such vast authority I should prefer so to write that my words should mean whatever truth anyone could find in them rather than express one true meaning so clearly as to exclude all others . . .' (Conf. 12.31). And if the word of God be indeed the word of God, should not Augustine have the rights of the matter? Centuries of the spiritual exercise of lectio divina might seem to confirm it. St Teresa of Avila describes a state in which 'a truth was revealed to me which is the fulfilment of all truths. I cannot tell how this was, for I saw</page><page sequence="5">SAINT AUGUSTINE 297 nothing. I was told, without seeing by whom, but I clearly under stood that it was the Truth itself: ". . .All the harm that befalls the world comes from a failure to understand the truths of scripture in all their true clarity . . ." ' (Life, c. 40). And a great contemporary theologian includes St Augustine in a long line of spiritual exegetes who have 'realized how the infinite shines directly through the fear ful intensity of the prophets, of Jesus, of Paul and of John: how the human word and gesture are but a thin veil before it . . .' Hence it is that at the point in the Confessions where he projects his spiritual Odyssey from the past and the present into the future the thirst of Augustine is that of the Psalmist - to 'meditate on the wonders of thy law' (Conf. 10.43). Law understood here not as a merely ritual or moral code but as the all-comprehending uttered word of subsistent Truth, the 'Way' of other great traditions, the way up and back to the Source of reality and truth. ('I am the way and the truth . . .') In this light the range of the meditation has to be co-extensive with existence and its history, from the first begin ning to the last end of things, 'from the first beginning, when you made heaven and earth (Gen. 1:1), until our everlasting reign with you in your holy city' (Conf. 11.2). (Hence the at first sight strange appendage of a commentary on the Genesis creation account in the last three Books of the Confessions. It was the classical Patristic focus for cosmogony and eschatology.) IV Obviously in a few pages we cannot follow the detailed steps of that 'way' in this most voluminous of early Christian writers. But it is important to see him whole. And glancing forward to his influence in history I don't know if it is relevant any longer to mention what used to be called the 'perennial philosophy'. Some of us were reared - in Ulis diebus - on the Aristotelian Aquinas, at least in vitamin tablet form. We did not know that there was another scholastic summa, in St Bonaventure's Platonist Augustinianism. The pity of it is obvious if it be true, as has been said, that everyone is born either a Platonist or an Aristotelian. (But by now both may have fallen into the pit!) Of course the Thomist of strict observance denied that Augustine was a 'philosopher' at all (sit venia verbo from Lisnagoola). He was not technical, systematic or complete. He did not distinguish departments and levels of thinking. He mixed up philosophy with theology, and both with something called Christian wisdom. Since then of course handmaid and mistress alike have lost their stays and look a great deal less neat and tidily 'scientific'. Augustine sought the whole truth, not the compartmental kind (hence 'wisdom'). He sought it where and how he could find it - including the path of</page><page sequence="6">298 THE FURROW 'driest' dialectic. But his thinking with the heart as well as the head makes him congenial to the 'existential' and religious sensibility. This congeniality is due also to the deep and varied human needs that he requires truth to satisfy. Truth for the intellect alone is notional and abstract. It is 'real' only as possessing and possessed by the heart. And the Augustinian quest is two-fold, not for truth alone but for beatitudo as well, two facets of the same reality. The search can come to rest only in God. All lesser truths, all lower kinds of happiness, are incomplete and frustrating. Man's search cannot rest short of their ground in the Absolute. His whole being is magnetized towards what is his own ground too. 'Thou hast made us towards thyself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in thee.' This drive towards rest only in God is also rooted in a deep metaphysical insight - the contingence of all that exists outside its ground in God. He had the insight by nature, but, like the conver sion to philosophy, there was a moment of particularly forceful awakening to its truth. That was when a friend of his youth died and he 'discovered' death and the contingence of frail, individual human existence. 'I became a great enigma to myself, and I was forever asking my soul why it was so sad and why it disquieted me so sorely' (Conf. 4.4). Hence the search for the ground in which we may stand and be established forever. God is the life of this tran sient life that is ours - 'should I call it dying life or living death?' (Conf. 1.6). God alone 'stands and abides forever'. In him alone can our transience be established in stability forever (Conf 4.11). Only hereafter will this stability be permanent. But Augustine knew that it begins in this life. He had an occasional experience of its reality. And he longed for the occasional experience to become a permanent state. A constant motif after conversion is the longing not, as he puts it, to be made more intellectually certain of God's existence but 'to be established more firmly in him'. Could the pass ing moment of experience be made permanent that would be, in a way, to abide in what abides forever, to 'enter into the joy of the Lord'. But, as classically, the moment always passed, leaving only a memory, a fragrance and a longing. T can remain in my ordinary state though unwilling. I would remain in that other state but I am unable. In both states I know my misery' (Conf. 10.40). V Saints alive! Have we already pitched Augustine out of sight? Not, I should hope, for the many who still experience their existence as that of 'a particle adrift in the universe' (Teilhard). Nor for the many who would like the 'spiritual life' to be really a life. In prayer, for instance, that reaches beyond the clich?s and the for</page><page sequence="7">SAINT AUGUSTINE 299 mulae to some sense of the reality of God. Nor again for all who have to start where Augustine starts: where all the ladders start, In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart. For this transcendentalist also insisted that it is only from where a man has fallen that he can start to get up. (As regards his often alleged over-emphasis on that fallenness ... I don't know if we have the right to be too bland about that in the century of Freud and Jung and Treblinka.) It is at this ground-floor level that Augustine first comes 'alive'. He travels far and ascends high but his starting point is experience. The journey is experience. Even the metaphysics along the way are experience, not so much abstract excogitation as a key discovered to unlock experience. The farthest point of arrival is experience, in those 'higher' moments already mentioned. Experience deep enough does not date. So Augustine can be a contemporary across the cen turies. Even the ground-floor experience is a sounding of the depths, a descent into the basement, into the 'abyss of human con sciousness'. 'Great is the power of memoria, a thing, O my God, to be in awe of, a profound and immeasurable multiplicity. And this thing is my mind, this thing am I. What then am I, O my God? Of what kind is my being? A life powerfully various, manifold, immeasurable' (Conf. 10.17). VI There is no conveying that life without reading Augustine's own Confessions. There we savour it in all its inexhaustible density, as a lived experience and a meditated question. At all its levels from nature to supernature. In all its extension between its two infinities, from its origins ex nihilo to its destiny in eternity. The Confessions end, as indicated earlier, with the end of journeying in the repose of the eternal Sabbath. They begin with exploration backwards into the darkness of unremembered infancy. Before that again a ques tion about the nature of pre-natal existence in the mother's womb. 'And before that again, O God of my joy? Was I anywhere? Was I anyone? There is no one to tell me - neither my parents nor any man's experience, nor any memory of my own' (Conf. 1.6). Confession in fact is a new literary genre generated by such meditations. It is deeper and more comprehensive than the autobiography which the Confessions also are at one level (and the first fully developed example of it). Confession is the genre appropriate to the relation between me and thee, the individual soul and its creator, the two luminous poles of reality we referred to earlier. Confession at a depth which has its taproot in the Bible - although glimpsed by Plotinus too - as the spontaneous avowal of</page><page sequence="8">300 THE FURROW what comes home to the creature on glimpsing its condition in rela tion to its creator. Confession of sin and praise, of man's guilt and of God's glory, and of the gulf that divides creator from created. 'I was shaken with love and with dread, and I knew that I was far from thee in a region of unlikeness' (Conf. 7.10). At their core then the Confessions are an extended spiritual exer cise. Augustine himself tells us (in 10.3) how the first instalments already stirred up the hearts of the readers. Written in his mid forties they stirred up his own heart in old age, when he re-read them in the course of revising all his works (oewvre-conscious writer that he was). And a distinguished, if little-known, woman in the history of spirituality recorded in the seventeenth century how she was liberated (into prayer) by the Confessions of her 'glorious St Augustine' (after long misery with 'methods' and 'idiot's devo tions' of every kind). We have not the space to go in detail through all the stages of human experience, outer and inner and higher, through which the reader of the Confessions is led. But we must trace an outline. We can get a quick line and part of the way with Shakespeare's seven ages of man. Augustine was there before him, through the symbolism of the seven days of the creation narrative in Genesis. We have already noted the framing of the Confessions between 'their exits and their entrances'. Within that framework Augustine too follows first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. Then the whining schoolboy . . . . . . creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover Sighing like furnace . . . But already the northern sequence is not quite right for the man of the south. Reading his Virgil as a precocious secondary student Augustine sighed over the love of Dido for Aeneas. 'And if I were kept from reading I grieved at not reading the tales that caused me such grief (Conf. 1.13). The 'love' proper began in the steaming adolescence of his sixteenth year. (Another 'first' for Augustine - his anticipation of so many 'portraits of the artist as a young man'.) Not much romantic sighing there - except in frustration with his inability to 'digtinguish the white light of love from the fog of lust' (Conf. 2.2). With this conflict the 'lover' would dally for another sixteen years. ('Give me chastity . . . but not just yet Conf. 8.7). It would be resolved only in the Walpurgisnacht of the garden scene in Milan (Conf. 8.11-12). Meanwhile ... 'I became to myself a waste land' (Conf 1.10). 'To Carthage then I came.' Teen-and-twenty university years of</page><page sequence="9">SAINT AUGUSTINE 301 continued emotional tides but also of intellectual awakening. A Stephen Dedalus, moody and brooding, alternately gregarious and solitary, in need of companions and contemptuous of their crude ways. Hungry before 'the gates of all the ways of error and glory'. Hungry above all for love, the love given and returned in which, transposed, he will eventually locate the whole gravitational field of man. ('You have made us towards yourself . . .') But love still divided by the fissure between the limpid commerce of soul with soul and the pitch of instinctual desire. 'O my God . . . with what gall did you sprinkle the sweets of that time . . .' (Conf. 1.3). Conflicting emotions however that in those years already settled on one woman, 'not joined to me in lawful marriage, but one whom wandering desire and no particular judgement brought my way. Yet I had but that woman, and I was faithful to her' (Conf. 4.2). A union that 'needed only the honourable name of marriage' but was broken after many years by the career-conscious Monica. Augustine's heart, 'which had held that woman very dear, was broken and wounded and bleeding' (Conf. 6.15). Like Stephen, an image 'had passed into his soul for ever'. University years of emotional tides that brought the equally tidal intellectual awakening that set the course of his life. The 'conver sion' to philosophy - as philosophy was then understood, in the high, serious existential sense of the search for the meaning of existence. 'Suddenly all the vanity I had hoped in I saw as worth less, and with an incredible intensity of desire I longed for deathless wisdom . . .' (Conf. 3.4). The search took all the years into his thirties. Years of which he often took stock in despair at the little progress made since his turn ing round in his nineteenth year. Years made more burdensome by the conflict between the search for meaning and the necessary futility of careerist advancement. 'Perish all this. Let me dismiss this vanity and emptiness and give myself wholly to the search for truth' (Conf. 6.11). The problems that held him back are still pertinent, and even at times reassuring for those still on the road. Problems with the anthropomorphism of scripture. Problems with the nature and meaning of Christ. Problems of the intense intellectual, unable to take on faith what he wanted to understand. And, for such an intellectual, the strangest - and for our little positivistic minds the most consoling - problem of all: his inability to conceive how God, or any spiritual being, could be anything other than nothing without matter and spatial extension. And all the time the endless problem of evil, no academic problem for him but felt in the mar row of the bone in his own dividedness against himself. Hence the long sojourn with Manicheanism, a system elaborate in the details</page><page sequence="10">302 THE FURROW but simple in principle - the age-old cutting of the Gordian knot by dualism. Barriers broken down by the combined light of the Christian bishop and the pagan philosopher, Ambrose and Plotinus. And the barriers being down, the streaming in of the transcendent light, in a flash of higher seeing. He had long sought truth. Now 'he who knows that light knows Truth . . . And I said "Is Truth then nothing at all, merely because it is not extended either through finite spaces or infinite?" And thou didst cry to me from afar: "I am who am." And I heard thee as one hears in the heart; and from that moment there was no ground of doubt in me' (Conf. 7.10). That was intellectual light. Moral light was needed before the practical step could be taken. The reason was Augustine's option for the absolute Christianity of the evangelical counsels. Very bothersome here was the single state for the sake of the Kingdom. The struggle, slip and slide of the final release into that is, I sup pose, the most dramatic scene in the history of religious experience. When the moment came 'it was as though a light of utter confidence shone in my heart, and all the darkness of uncertainty vanished away' (Conf. 8.12). There remained but a couple of weeks to the end of the teaching year. Augustine had long wanted to withdraw, a disenchanted academic in an age of leaf meal words, words, words. To avoid public attention he would stick it out to the end. Eight months to Easter and baptism. To prepare for it - and to restore his physical health and jangled nerves - he retired to a friend's house in the country, somewhere in the plain of Lombardy, in a 'quiet watered land' in sight of the Alpine peaks. With the candidate for baptism we have come round to where we began. To us it looks like an ending. For Augustine it was more like the real beginning. In Augustine, after the Bible, Plotinus and earlier Fathers, 'conversion' is one of the directing ideas of the complete spiritual life. It is not a once-for-all event but a life-long process. After the initial epistroph?, conversio, turning round and towards, there is the sustained moving towards the source and the term of our being. That is the axis of our orientation. 'Thou has made us towards thyself . . .' Consequently a recurring motif in the Confessions after conversion is the prayer to God to complete the conversion he then began. A completion to be accomplished only at the point where the Confessions and, echoing their opening theme, in the anticipated repose of the eternal Sabbath, symbolized in that seventh day when God rested after all his works. That is the range of the life's project Augustine had set himself as he retraced his steps in the autumn of 387, from Milan to Rome and Ostia to take ship again for Africa. A project to be lived at first</page><page sequence="11">SAINT AUGUSTINE 303 within the formal structures of a contemplative life. Later to be reconciled with the pastoral cares to which he was quickly called. It was not a narrow project. Like much in Augustine, and others of the age, it combined the highest ideals of Greek philosophy with the highest of Christianity. Throughout his life Augustine remained what he was as a questioning youth, the man of 'faith seeking understanding'. And beyond theoretic understanding some experiential foretaste of the supreme Reality, its joy, its repose, and something we get only from spirits as great as Augustine's - an adequate notion of the grandeur of God. 'All heaven and earth cannot contain you. For you made them, and me in them' (Conf. 1.2). It was in Ostia that he had his most famous foretaste of that Reality. Resting before the voyage, mother and son talked together in peace as they leaned out of a window looking on to the garden of the house they were staying in. 'With the mouth of our heart we panted for the high waters of your fountain, the fountain of the life that is with you: that being sprinkled from that fountain according to our capacity we might in some sense meditate upon so great a matter. (...) Higher and higher we soared ... to come at last to that region of richness unending where you feed Israel forever with the food of truth, and where life is that Wisdom by which all things are made . . . And while we were thus talking of his Wisdom, and panting after it, with all the effort of our heart we did for one ins tant attain to touch it. Then sighing, and leaving the first fruits of our spirit bound to it, we returned to the sound of our own voices . . .' (Conf. 9.10).</page></plain_text>
