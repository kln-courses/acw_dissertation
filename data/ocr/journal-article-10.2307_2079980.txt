<plain_text><page sequence="1">The American West: A Twentieth-Century History. By Michael P. Malone and Richard W. Etulain. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989. xii + 347 pp. Paper, $12.95, ISBN 0-8032-8167-6.) Historians of the American West have proven reluctant to write twentieth-century syntheses of the region. This is undoubtedly due to sev- eral reasons: the scarcity of neat organizing principles for the modern period, some linger- ing fascination or preoccupation with the fron- tier, and simple confusion brought on by the chaos of the modern history of the West. That neglect is waning, as a result of the publication of this book and other works, such as the recent study by Richard White, "It's Your Misfortune</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 719 and None of My Own" (1991). Michael P. Ma- lone and Richard W. Etulain pull together many of the newer writings on the modern West, and their volume is an apt and timely indication of the increasing focus turned on the region's twentieth-century change and growth. Both authors are respected senior historians, and they have assembled a great deal of material to present their overview. Mov- ing briskly through such broad themes as eco- nomics, politics, culture, and demography, the volume's seven chapters highlight the vast changes that the region has undergone over the past one hundred years. The changes themselves are breathtaking. A multi-ethnic demographic explosion, a mush- rooming urban landscape, and the implanta- tion of federal dollars, contracts, and employ- ees all help to make the new West an extraor- dinarily vibrant and complicated place. The authors have done a fine job in illustrating this complexity. By synthesizing the best of recent historiography, Malone and Etulain do the field a real service. As with any such ambitious project, The American West raises some issues that require critical comment. One is the authors' tendency to reify "the West" as a historical actor - absorbing citizens, building capital, erecting structure and infrastructure all by itself. This is a curious slide into anthropomorphism, one inappropriate in this context, especially given the authors' tendency to treat the region's busi- ness and political history as a detailed bio- graphical sequence of important players. Fur- thermore, the book's discussions of culture, art, and literature are remarkably convention- al, again marking off distinct periods by brief character sketches of important figures. (An- other strange glitch: it is a mistake to lump "Spanish-speaking" and "Mexican-American" together as if they are necessarily the same thing.) Perhaps most nagging of all, there is a sense throughout the book that "the West" should have created a unified, regional cul- ture, outlook, even world view. That it did not can be celebrated as evidence of spirited cross- class, cross-cultural debate, and yet the reader is left with the sense that the authors consider the resulting cacophony a modern western shortcoming. This is a mistaken notion from the start. To suggest that the vast western land- scape could ever - should ever - develop a uni- form cultural makeup smacks of a sort of wish- ful homogeneity. It is difficult to know just when any field is ripe for scholarly synthesis; sooner rather than later seems the right approach, and it is cer- tainly good to have this book out so that it can be read and discussed. That said, however, it is clear that it would have been improved had its authors exercised a firmer touch on their material. Surely, issues of western continuity across the centuries, western ethnic coalition building, or, more specifically, the critical role of the state of California (none of which plays much part here) could provide substantive themes around which to construct direct argu- ments. Despite these shortcomings - admit- tedly sins more of omission than commission - this book does provide a jumping-off point for further attempts at synthesizing the complex twentieth-century history of the western Unit- ed States.
