Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2010. xxv + 403 pp. Illustrations, maps, figures, tables, notes, bibliography, and index. Cloth $85.00, paper $32.95. This ambitious book surveys a vast region during the first several decades of the twentieth century: the "land/water" of the Canadian northwest stretching from Lake Winnipeg in a curve to Great Bear Lake and the MacKenzie Valley. It was defined, Piper shows, not only by shared natural featuresâ€”lakes, muskeg, permafrost, and bush-but also by the enduring perception of a place of "natural resources" to be accessed, managed, and extracted as efficiently as possible. Piper argues that while the industries of the 1920s moderated their activities in response to the environment, the later development of white fish fisheries and radium and uranium mining from the 1940s to the 1960s unmasked the process of industrial transformation already in place. The study has three sections: the physical environment and the early indus trialization of the 1920s; the intensified development of two principal indus tries: mining and whitefish commercial fishery up to about i960; and the networks and legacies of energy and waste. The story of transportation that weaves in and out of the book's chapters is an exceptional illustration of one of her general arguments about the region: it was a network of nodes rather than a continuous territory with the lakes themselves as the epitome of and rationale for this definition. In this region, unlike both more southerly regions and corresponding northern ones in Siberia or Scandinavia, transporta tion remained a blend of alternatives (rail, air, river, ice road, highway routes) rather than showing a clear sequence of development. In a case study of Great Slave Lake, Piper shows that transformation of fishing from 1945 to 1950 provides a compressed version of the twentieth-century pattern of changes in techniques and capital, concepts of productivity and tensions between local residents (Native and white), government, and industry across the region. This is a familiar but still compelling account of the intersections between economic practices, political policies, local communities, and natural environment. The study of radium and uranium mining, however, leads Piper into a sustained and original discussion of different intersections: the legal, geological, and cultural conceptions of underground nature. The final chapters on fuel and waste examine the counterpart to resource extraction-the enor mous input of fuel and supplies into the region. For Piper, this analysis of the energy required to split rock or haul people and goods epitomizes how the region was integrated into an international economy controlled from a dis tance. Similarly, she argues, we can examine the actual distribution of the waste products of industrialization, from mine tailings to fish guts, to see how the new industrial order "disassembled" communities, ecosystems, and landscapes. Perhaps it is the scale and complexity of this account that leaves the reader with a curiously impersonal history. It is not that the sources are dry: Piper's research is impressively wide-ranging, and she finds plenty of frank voices in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS | 355 mining company and fisheries science reports. Nor is the natural environment so static as to resist a narrative of character and agency. Piper conveys well the often violent dynamics of the seasons, the variability of lake ecosystems, and the implications of anthropomorphic geology with its veins and bodies of ore. Nevertheless, this account gives us a region that humans managed rather than experienced and a detached rather than an intimate sense of place.
