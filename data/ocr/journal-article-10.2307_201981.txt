<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vital Realism and Sociology: A Metatheoretical Grounding in Mead, Ortega, and Schutz DAVID LEWIS Portland, OR RAYMOND McLAIN SUNY Fredonia ANDREW WEIGERT University of Notre Dame Metatheoretical codifications of the sociological writings of George H. Mead, Jose Ortega y Gasset, and Alfred Schutz highlight the importance of the idea of life and of a commitment to a realist perspective. The authors turn common concern with the life concept in three directions: evolutionary emergence, historical rationality, and phe- nomenological analysis. In spite of differences, these directions share an empirically grounded starting point in the situated individual and its environment, and end with suggestions for a universalist rationality. Preliminary metatheoretical principles from these authors offer a start toward a vital realist sociology fitted to the universal conditions of social life. Sociologies based on George H. Mead, Jose Ortega y Gasset, and Alfred Schutz may seem to have little in common. Yet there are lines of convergence from an American pragmatic social behaviorist, a Spanish phenomenological historical philosopher, and an Austrian analytic social phenomenologist (for interpretive materials see Gray 1989; Holmes 1975; Joas 1985; Marias 1970; McClintock 1971; Miller 1973; Silver 1978; Wagner 1983). We believe that the central ideas of these thinkers from different cultural traditions and successive generations converge on a helpful perspective for contemporary sociology. This perspective is helpful because current metatheoretical debates on the nature of human life and the possibility of rational knowledge reveal a deep need for firmer grounding. Exponents of universalism and relativism, subjectivism and empiricism, hu- manism and antihumanism, science and rhetoric, representationalism and self-referentiality compete for intellectual hegemony. In general, rationalist epistemologies are used to establish some metatheoretical basis for reflection on human life (e.g., Giddens 1984; Habermas 1984), while postmodernists critically link rationalist epistemologies of any kind to structures of domination (Foucault 1978; Lyotard 1984). Other theorists reject metatheoretical work in favor of various forms of analytic empiricism (see Ritzer 1983, 1991; Turner 1986). These debates threaten to lose coherence as each position vies for sole occupancy of different grounds for reflection, as if no common ground were possible. Vital realism responds to this state of affairs with an approach to life and knowledge that attempts to avoid imperialism. At the same time it proposes an objective and universal starting point for metatheoretical discussion, namely organism-environment interaction. Our strategy is not a conservative one that intends only to return to previous historical or hegemonic positions. Vital realism is not an end point or a value configuration, but a point of departure with which competing metatheories can come to grips. Vital realism Sociological Theory 11:1 March 1993</page><page sequence="2">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY grounds this privilege in its claim that in fact, reflection on human life rests on historically universal concepts that emerge from the concrete relationships with others and with the surrounding world. This starting point generates social life as a point of origin for the human sciences. We analyze Mead, Ortega, and Schutz to illustrate this claim and arrive at some general principles of a vital realist position. The choice of theorists is strategic: they, represent three distinct cultural contexts and three somewhat overlapping generations. Propositions characterizing a vital realist position could be derived as well from other authors, but our selection reflects more than a confluence of thought that defies cultural, generational, and philosophical boundaries. It also suggests an array of differences that represents the breadth and openness of a vital realist perspective. Vital realism is not a proselytizing label, but a root image (see Blumer 1969, ch. 1). Because concepts that mediate knowledge are grounded in the historical actions of real persons, vital realism remains open to critique and development by metatheoretical efforts that seek to understand both the transcendence and the grounding of human symbols. It does not preempt debate; it seeks a more focused debate. This paper is not an explication de text, a history of ideas, or formal theory construction. It attempts to delineate a coming-together of fruitful metatheoretical elements from an "internal, intellectual" perspective as a "prelude" to further theorizing (see Ritzer 1991).1 Such metatheoretical work illuminates convergences that suggest greater theoretical strength and relevance than would be seen by viewing each theorist separately. The mixed genre of this paper requires forbearing readers. It is divided into three sections. The first addresses the concept "vital realism." The second codifies main lines of convergence, noting differences where appropriate. The final section offers preliminary principles grounding a vital realist sociology. WHY VITAL REALISM? The evocative phrase vital realism calls for boundaries and clarification. We are not intending a bastardized synthesis of two nineteenth-century movements of thought, namely vitalism and realism. These terms are included in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1931-1935), but not in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1968). The reason for their disappearance is no doubt expressed by Mead (1936) as fatal limi- tations of irrationalism or naivete, from which he disassociated himself. The same can be said for Ortega (1966, 3) and Schutz (1967). The difficulty with mere vitalism was that it undermined conceptual knowledge. For example, the philosophy of Henri Bergson influenced each of the thinkers, but also was judged irrational or incomplete (e.g., Mead 1936, p. 510, 1938, p. 517, 1964, pp. 270ff; Ortega, 1963, pp. 14, 193; 1964, pp. 36, 89, 106, 111, 1966, pp. 270-71; Schutz 1967, p. 12, passim, 1982; also see Joas 1985; Marias 1970; Wagner 1983). It was an irrationalist doctrine directed against extreme mechanism and idealism. Bergson's view was that reality ' Following Ritzer's (1991) typology of metatheoretical analyses, this paper starts with Mu, or a metatheoretical attempt at systematic comparative understanding, but with the goal of a preliminary Mp-that is, a metatheoretical prelude to a new, or newly clarified, theoretical perspective. The paper is primarily an "internal-intellectual" analysis: it compares theoretical texts of the three theorists on cognitive dimensions. The search for convergences and complementarities proceeds by codifying three perspectives that, in our judgment have not yet been compared systematically. We believe the effort is fruitful, both in order to understand them better or to find convergences, and to discover a theoretical foundation for a reconstructed perspective that enlarges meaning to include organismic and environmental as well as social realities. The need for such work is suggested by the absence of metatheoretical references to society-environment studies in Ritzer's volume. In spite of the recent growth of ecological and environmental sociology, it is relatively absent from metatheoretical discussions. 73</page><page sequence="3">is in a continuous state of flux, that it is duree. Science, and conceptualization in general, attempt erroneously to freeze and isolate parts of a changing, continuous whole; the concept destroys that which it is supposed to know. Knowledge, then, must come from an immediate intuition into reality. The elan vital, the primordial vital force, cannot be understood by the methods of science as then practiced. The "realism" popular at the turn of the century went to an opposite extreme in reaction against idealism. It was grounded in the conviction that reality is known by representations that are (or in principle can be) exact copies of that reality. Science and philosophy are to mirror the real world faithfully. There is one reality; subject to correctable errors, we can know that reality as it is. Mead, Ortega, and Schutz opposed this naive, copy brand of realism. What, then, justifies vital realism as a descriptor for the commonalities of Mead, Ortega, and Schutz? First, each rebelled against the idealism that placed reality somewhere inside an hypostatized consciousness. Second, each believed in an objective reality that can be known but never exhausted. Third, we refer to an earlier realism, akin to that of perennial Western philosophy. Scholastic realists in the Aristotelian tradition understood that knowledge of the world is mediated by concepts or "universals" that are not mere copies or aggregates of partic- ulars. On the contrary, universals transcend particulars, which are to be interpreted as time-bound instantiations of the universal. In opposition to nominalistic thinking, which claims priority for particulars, conceptual universals provide the necessary basis of reality that is shared as known. To know anything is to conceive it publicly as an instance of a universal in its relation to other universals; otherwise we are left with unintelligible private "sensa." A totally unique and novel phenomenon cannot be a perceived and shared known object. Consequently, rejecting the conceptual base does not pave the way for a more pristine knowledge of reality. Even if such a feat were possible, it would leave us with an unintelligible experiential manifold, not with knowledge as a basis for action. We need universals in order to constitute experience as meaningful-that is, as shared known objects. Scholastic realists, however, struggled with the metaphysical status of universals. Are they objectively "real" or are they only mental entities? The extreme realists argued that universals have a being totally independent of the human mind. Universals are eternal forms; we apprehend them only by divine mediation. They are real in God's mind; therefore it would be heretical and anthropomorphic to contend, as nominalists did, that universals are nothing more than flatus vocis, lit. "blowings of the voice" or "voiced sounds," mere names. The scholastic realists' solution to the metaphysical status of universals grounded their reality in a theological doctrine: universals existed in nature, but as God's creation. None of our three thinkers, however, accepts such a theological solution. Vital realism seeks the reality of universals within everyday historical activity, not in transcendent mysticism or theological entities. Within human activity, the reality of universals is revealed by their empirically available conditions. The term vital seems to be warranted on at least two grounds. First, it indicates that representations of the world must be grounded in concrete relationships among humans and between humans and sociophysical environments. Second, these relationships are not immutable forms; they are contingent historical manifestations of issues essential to human existence, both bio- logical and moral. Because universals emerge in human activity-itself a vital process-the sociohistori- cally limited universals on which social worlds are built cannot be understood adequately via a priori deductions. Rather, the epistemic basis of knowledge depends on the workings 74 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="4">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY of our concepts as they bridge inner and outer worlds, consciousness and environment. Their reality derives from functioning relationships among individuals, and between in- dividuals and their environments. Vital realism holds that reality cannot be defined strictly in terms of the particular subject, as nominalists argue, or in terms of some essential property of the object, as naive or scholastic realists believe, but rather in terms of the interrelations between subject and object within the process of human life. The social thought of Mead, Ortega, and Schutz contains fruitful elements for theoretical sociology. Mead (1934, 1938) speaks of the real "social life process" that encompasses the activity of social selves in a "world that is there," phrases that support a realist interpretation of his thought (see Lewis and Smith 1980). Ortega proclaims life, circum- stances, and razon historica or razon vital as central ideas for understanding contemporary crises (1963, p. 45; 1964, pp. 201ff., 1984). Schutz (1967, 1982; Schutz and Luckmann 1973, 1989) spent his career unpacking the meaningful structures of the social world based on the "life world" (Lebenswelt), the commonsense world of everyday life. In spite of their differences, each thinker posited some form of real world against the idealist thesis, and grounded that reality in human life. Each appreciated the dual foundation of individuals confronted with an irreducible social and historical world and an obdurate physical envi- ronment. Each saw that human life is possible through an underlying dynamic that generates emergent levels of action, which one must conceptualize systemically to under- stand today's crises.2 From this common problematic flowed their sociological reflections. Mead's realism is grounded in the intersubjectivity of distant objects as embedded in social acts. The reality of objects is filled cognitively as the self takes the attitude of a community of knowers, a generalized other, toward the object. Although Mead usually discussed the generalized other as socially constructed, at times he refers to aspects of the physical world as included in a relevant generalized other (1934, p. 154 fn., p. 185; 1964, p. 336). The realism is vital in the sense that Mead conceptualized objects within ongoing action that has historical and futuristic aspects. These aspects derive meaning from orga- nized responses based on shared perspectives. Examples of shared, and thus real, per- spectives are the truth claims of science and the policy enactments of politics. We find each of our theorists accepting a kind of realism. In sum, we argue for what we may call "scientific realism," thus bracketing for the time being the thorny and probably insoluble, or at least never universally persuasive, epistemelogical issues. In our view, '2 Mead, the earliest of the trio, was a social reformer and an academic. He had a nineteenth-century American higher education: sojourns at universities in Berlin and Leipzig, and at Harvard. He taught at Michigan and at the young giant, the University of Chicago. Mead worked for women's rights, educational reform, and other causes with a seemingly optimistic belief in evolution, science, and democracy. He never was forced from a homeland devastated by war. Mead's metaphor of life resembled a friendly neighborhood baseball game continually reconstructed by the mindful cooperation of increasing numbers of players. Ortega, born 20 years later but into the societal context of an earlier time, was a political reformer and cultural broker who worked mightily to introduce Europe to Spain. He too spent university years in Berlin, and especially in Marburg, before returning to Madrid as a young professor of philosophy. He spoke, wrote, taught, and edited the best thinking of Europe in the beginning of the twentieth century. As an elected Republican politician, he fled for his life from the aftermath of civil war. Ortega spent most of his mature years in exile, and returned to a new Spain as an aging symbol of its modernization. Ortega's metaphor of life resembled a bullfight (of which he was an aficionado), in which the alert matador triumphs by physical grace and cool wits in a struggle that ironically combines cooperation and opposition between humans and nature with solitary courage, ritual drama, beauty, and death-just as complexly precarious as life itself. Schutz was a "banker by day and a phenomenologist by night." Shaken in battle as a young soldier in World War I, he returned to university life. After he wrestled with Bergson's foundational intuitions, his only book integrated Husserl's phenomenology and Weber's theory. World War II uprooted Schutz again; he emigrated to New York and spent his scholarly time with European emigres and select American social thinkers. He wrote mainly during vacations, and obtained a full-time academic post only in his last years. Schutz was an accom- plished musician; his metaphor of life was that of two musicians growing old together, making music during precious time away from the paramount reality of the workaday world. Such metaphors of life inform the theoretical visions of a born American, a Spanish exile, and an Austrian immigrant. 75</page><page sequence="5">realism asserts that 1) there is an external reality that humans can know; 2) this foundational assertion implicates the knower in criteria for claiming knowledge and for adjudicating competing claims; 3) the knower is positioned morally as a scientific "professor" of one version or another of the world in terms of shared truth and morality claims. Realism, then, is a commitment to a socially grounded ability to know the empirical world "better" (for philosophically and socially informed discussions see Harre 1990; McMullin 1988). As claimants, we state our criteria for accepting an account as "more realistic," and recognize the moral implication for guiding action that is responsible to such realistic accounts. Each of our theorists made this kind of commitment: Mead's scientific method as adapted to social issues, Ortega's contemplative solitary battle of perspectives that leads back to praxis, and Schutz's gearing into the paramount reality of the workaday world. This realism focuses on getting on with life, a vital realism. In the next section we present a selective summary of what we may call the "philo- sophical sociologies" of Mead, Ortega, and Schutz with an eye toward their metatheoretical commonalities. A vital realist perspective neither begins nor ends with our theoretical trio (see Rochberg-Halton 1989 on the "life-concept"). We think that their convergences are worthwhile in part because they come from three cultures and generations. Schutz, as the youngest, recognized points of contact with the other two (Schutz and Luckmann 1989, appendix). Recent examples such as Goffman, Garfinkel, Giddens, and Alexander (1982) also touch vital realist themes. The act of recognizing and codifying the perspectives enriches theoretical dialogue by making it explicitly possible to compare metatheoretical orientations. Comparisons focus theoretical dialogue on a clearer plane of abstraction for understanding substantive and methodological issues as a prelude to further theorizing. Our understanding is that no one of the theoretical perspectives is sufficient in itself for grounding an adequate synthesis. Mead, for example, locates social realities within a behaviorist-pragmatist orientation that builds mostly on socially constructed "me"s and on social worlds rooted in metatheoretical assumptions of social integration and progress. These assumptions, as such, are inadequate for grounding a vital realism. Ortega delineates a world that is existentially real for individuals, vividly personal "I"s who struggle alertly with historical circumstances and are capable of reflexive contemplation and heroic action. His project, however, needs strengthening in methodological rigor and philosophical systemics in order to become a theoretical and empirical sociological enterprise. Finally, Schutz's phenomenology offers a philosophically grounded and conceptually rigorous analysis of people's natural attitude in the everyday life-world. His writings tend, however, to remain on a formal, ahistorical, and analytic level even as he reminds readers of the fundamental anxiety of death. Each of our theorists and the traditions they represent offer ingredients for developing a vital realist perspective, but we believe that no one alone is sufficient. Together, however, their convergence is stronger and their differences complementary. We proceed by outlin- ing each position along metatheoretical dimensions. This process leads to a preliminary codification of commonalities and differences as a foundation for a vital realist perspective. In the next step, others may examine, criticize, and (we hope) develop this work. THE PERSPECTIVES OF MEAD, ORTEGA, AND SCHUTZ The perspectives are codified around five metatheoretical dimensions3 (see Ritzer 1991, p. 312): 1) the paradigmatic formulation of the basic datum: the individual in relationship 3 Our tactic aims at what Ritzer calls Mp-metatheoretical analysis as a prelude to theory formulation-and we specify our effort as a comparative analysis seeking complementarities in the search for a convergence on 76 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="6">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY to the world; 2) the distinguishing feature of social existence; 3) the definition of the social as emergent; 4) the preferred method and form of knowing social reality; and 5) the key moral value. We speak of "perspective" by design: This was a technical term for Mead (1938, passim; 1964, pp. 306-19), an integral part of Ortega's thinking (1961; see Huescar 1966), and an operative term in Schutz's writings (1964, p. 72, passim). We hope these presentations will highlight convergences without reducing anyone to a straw man. George H. Mead (1863-1931) Paradigmatic formulation. A starting point in analyzing a perspective is to ask, "What is the generic nature of the object of theoretical focus?" For Mead, the generic issue is what we may call the "behavioral intersubjectivity" of an organism interacting with its environment (1982, pp. 110-17). If "society" exists only insofar as concerted action is possible among two or more actors, then the theoretical preconditions for behavioral intersubjectivity may be understood as the necessary conditions for communication. This holds for the natural world, whether we refer to a society of ants or of humans. Communication is grounded in gestures that evoke a response from other forms. If one duck on a pond is disturbed, it may quack and take furiously to the air. Nearby ducks sense this gesture, and soon the flock is in boiling motion, whereas a moment ago they had been resting peacefully. This is instinctive communication by natural signs. By contrast, specifically human communication takes place by "significant symbols" (Mead 1964, pp. 240-47). According to Mead's behaviorist account of the significant symbol, the human is capable of responding to a significant symbol in some inchoatively "same" way as the person(s) to whom it is directed (Mead 1982; Miller 1972). Behavioral intersubjectivity is founded on the significant symbol as gesture, and it constitutes social action as irreducible to aggregates of behavior. It is the foundation of society. The personal reality correlative to society is the self. In two articles (1964, pp. 142- 49, 267-93), Mead discussed the process by which the self emerges from interaction with the environment. Self is not a primordial endowment that exists at birth and grows like an acorn in the ground. The normal neonate of human parents has only the potential to develop a self through social interaction. Initially, social control operates externally through caretakers' gestures of approval and disapproval of the baby's relatively noninstinctual behaviors. As a result of conditioning, the baby develops habitual responses to objects in the environment. Its behavior is reasonably explicable through the "behavioral modifications" model. As the cortex grows and as social stimuli continue, the baby becomes aware when habitual responses do not produce the expected effect and when action remains blocked. In becoming aware, the person becomes an object to self and can ascribe qualities to it in the same way as to other objects in the environment. Self thus enters the objective environment, even its own. As object, self can take the attitude of the other and can criticize its own responses from the other's point of view. The individual incorporates social attitudes into self's behavioral responses and develops the capacity to plan and evaluate those responses self- consciously. In this way the social self emerges as experiences unfold and are reintegrated into the growing self. Social control comes to operate more profoundly within the person rather than merely as a response to external stimuli. This internal conversation between the "I" and the "me" continually gives rise to the social self (see Lewis 1979) and metatheoretical dimensions. We hope to stimulate theorizing adequate to our historical moment, though this outcome is promissory on others' work. 77</page><page sequence="7">differentiates Mead's social behaviorism from reductive psychological behaviorism. The social self is uniquely human and develops from interaction with environments writ large and communicated symbolically. The distinguishing feature of social existence. Humans use symbols to represent objects that are not immediately present to the senses. Conscious, symbolic representations provide fields of action that transcend physical space and time. The human animal's complex physiology allows it to respond with actions that can be delayed and then redirected by images at a later time. Symbolically delayed responses allow for reflection in which individuals consider images both from memory and from anticipated futures as the basis for action. These images include versions of self as objectified. They constitute reflection in the sense of self-awareness, or "reflexion" (Meltzer, Peters, and Reynolds 1975). As images are universalized and become concepts, the human is partially freed from the situated exigencies of the physical environment, including the body, and can act in terms of symbols, including symbols of the self. The individual becomes a cultured historical animal. The constitution of human action is not limited to the biological structure of physical individuals, but includes the sociocultural structure of historical individuals. The symbolic capacity involves the ability both to learn from the past, as stored in cultural artifacts, and to project this collective past into imagined futures. Mead (1932) suggests that we continually reconstruct the past by drawing inferences from the present as a basis for future action. The future comes into the present through images that direct the act. Consequently, humans act within a broader temporal horizon than other animals. Rational individuals learn from their past and plan for the future. A sense of a core self derives from reflection on past experiences in relation to a systematic set of symbolic representations. The symbolic representations of self-reflection are the organized responses of those who constitute the social environment-that is, "society." These societal responses are akin to those provided by relevant others whose anticipated responses guide self's action. The societal responder is the "generalized other," which serves not only as a model for social attitudes and roles, but also as a standard by which those attitudes and roles are evaluated by the reflexive self. Self is totally social through its capacity to transform the environment and self symbolically and thus to reflect rationally. This "socially constructed" self is the dialectical pole to Mead's "emergent" version, described above.4 The social as emergent. Human action progresses through four "stages": impulse, perception, manipulation, and consummation (Mead 1938). The social act relates self to the environment as other-that is, to that which responds in terms of the anticipated responses of relevant actors. The social organization of relevant others structures the social life process. Among animals, the principle of social organization is fundamentally instinc- tual. Their societies change relatively slowly because the physical environment confronts instinctually organized groups as a given. Among humans, social organization is funda- mentally cognitive and is derived from historical experiences that constitute the relatively rapidly changing environment of others who, like self, are organized symbolically. Such social organization results in an environment irreducible to instinctual environments; yet it remains within the evolutionary process. Mead recognized supra-individual reality. The individual encounters preexisting social realities that are largely beyond individual control. These realities provide the historically meaningful objects that limit an individual's biographical chances. Mead (1934, pp. 151- 4 We use dialectical here and throughout in a non-Marxist sense to refer to interacting and changing elements and their relationships. 78 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="8">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY 63, 1964, pp. 284-85) often indicated the supra-individual aspect by referring to children learning how to play games. Each player on the baseball field must know how other players will respond to game situations, such as a ball hit to the shortstop with the bases loaded. To play one's role rationally, a player must take the role of all others in the social act of making a double play. To play one's role effectively, a player must know how the roles of other relevant players fit together. Mead wrote: "This organized reaction becomes . . .the 'generalized other' . . . which provides him with a self" (1964, p. 285). The generalized other is social reality par excellence; it emerges from the actions of individuals; and responding to it provides individuals with a total self. Self and society are twin born. Social control, in its deepest meaning, consists of taking the attitude of the generalized other toward one's tendencies to respond. In this process, a social attitude controls our "presocial" impulses and directs them into meaningful action. Subjectivity is shaped by the generalized other; the individual becomes a social self. Society is reconstructed in the behavioral interaction of persons in ever-widening networks of social organization. The more extensive in space and time is the generalized other, the more objective and universal are our actions. The generalized other of an "international" or "scientific" attitude is more objective than that of particular groups. Method andform of knowledge of social reality. Mead's understanding of social reality is dominated by two ideas: evolution and science. Mead did not define evolution as simple progress. Rather, he meant that knowledge of social reality is based on the same way of knowing as enables us to understand nature in the widest sense. Nature is a process whose structures depend on the objective perspective of the knower. Knowledge is verified by whether it furthers human life in ever-wider reaches of objectivity and truth, in a mild sense. (Mead rarely treated truth separately.) Knowledge is continuously verified in ap- plications that change with the environment and with the evaluator's perspective. Underlying Mead's perspectivism is a general approach to knowledge, namely the hypothetical-experimental methods and the objective democratic discourse of science. Based on controlled experiment and hypotheses to be verified subsequently, science is the most efficient intersubjective communication. Gestures are enlarged through instruments that generate powerful symbols. Highly structured experiments make innovative responses possible. Science is cumulative and provides an encompassing universe of discourse. The scientific attitude is most adequate to the evolutionary model of reality and to the objectivity of knowledge in that the same results would be found by anyone in a comparable environment. Science is both a form of knowledge and a tool of moral reform. Key moral value. Morality is not a priori or blind adherence to the laws and customs of one's society; every existing society is unified to some extent by an irrational nationalism (1964, pp. 355-70). Neither is a moral person merely an enlightened individual with a privileged perspective. Mead stated the issue dialectically: ". . . Taking into account all of those interests which make up society on the one hand and the individual on the other is the method of morality" (1934, p. 389). Conduct takes its moral quality from the conflict of values in the situation. Like the scientist, the moral person must hypothetically assess which valued actions are best for enlarging the life of all people. Mead's moral meliorism is a social meliorism. The scientific attitude can address social problems rationally and universalistically. It allows humans to take relevant factors into account and to assess them as hypotheses against each other (1964, pp. 3-5, 248-66). The scientific method, the method of intel- ligence, provides the widest generalized other in which reflective consciousness "reaches its highest expression" (1964, p. 5). It offers a rational and objective perspective that can unite humanity in an "international-minded" attitude, which sets aside national differences in the interest of a global community; here, cooperation and common purpose can prevail 79</page><page sequence="9">(1964, pp. 365-69). Mead's moral vision ends in a small-town democracy of scientists, writ large. Jose Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955) Paradigmatic formulation. In his first book in 1914, Ortega exclaimed: "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia, y si no la salvo a ella no me salvo yo" (1975a, p. 30): "I am I and my circumstance, and if I do save it, I do not save myself." Underlying his thinking is the "phenomenon of human life" (1971, p. 180). Ortega's writings can be interpreted as an extended commentary on this paradigmatic formula. His intellectual vision faces the moder crisis based on idealistic rationalism and mechanistic naturalism. Against the former, he argued for the co-given reality of circumstances; against the latter, he argued for the reality of principles and historical interpretations irreducible to matter. His personalized existential phenomenology located history at the center of both human reality and his attempt to understand it. Ortega argues that "life" is the key discovery of the moder era. With life as the tool, he formulates an understanding both of the rationalism into which he was trained and against which he rebelled, and of the naturalism and science that he appreciated even as he saw it misunderstood. Humans must use reason, but a reason that remains true to life; it must be a "vital reason" and a "historical reason" (1984; even in 1915, as in 1987, pp. 110-11). Ortega's discovery of life and history obviated a priori definitions of human nature. There is no such "thing" as human nature; humans are homo sapiens but also insipiens, animal rationale but also irrationale. Definitions of human nature are attempts to enshrine a partial understanding of human life that renders it unintelligible. As Ortega argued, a human consists "in what it has not yet become! This essential, this most profound paradox is our life" (1964, p. 223). Such an understanding of human being is necessary. Otherwise history is a conceit and the past is mere chronology. The distinguishing feature of social existence. As beings who are partially defined by what is not yet, humans construct symbols through which they imagine alternative worlds and act out their imaginings. Futurity gives a dramatic quality to life. We are born onto a stage setting that we did not prepare, castaways upon a strange shore. I am a player in others' dramas, as they are in mine. As drama, there is no single meaning to my life; no fixed way to play my part; no guarantee that it will finish the day; and no sense of its final denouement. Authentic self is a solitary I, yet an I that must realize itself in an external common world: "the 'I' must be at once intimate and exotic, withdrawn and free, a prisoner and at liberty. The problem is startling" (1964, p. 182). "I" is not given at birth; the human birthright is to be simply and profoundly open to others. As a result of this openness, the Other and I enter into a relation We-within which the other . . . becomes defined as a . . . You, with whom I talk of that distant creature He-the third person. But now I must go on to describe my struggle with the You, in collision with whom ... I discover myself as being I and . . . only I .... the first person is the last to appear (1963a, p. 111; author's emphasis). The social genesis of the "I" does not mean that individuality is illusion. True, the individual occasionally is lost in the collective when self fails to live authentically; such chaotic otherness is Ortega's alteracion. The dramatic reality of life demands that we 80 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="10">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY realize and overcome the chaos of not knowing what to do or of mindlessly following social routines. Authentic life demands that we withdraw into the contemplative reflection of ensimismamiento, of "in one's own selfsameness." Ortega's word play on the double reflexivity of focusing on "one's own self" captures that unique reflexive awareness in which the individual focuses on self as an object and simultaneously is aware that the "I" is concomitantly subject and object (Weigert 1975a). Ensimismamiento overcomes the duality of self as subject and object, and lays the foun- dation for authentic action. The process is completed in praxis, in theoretically informed action that reflexively addresses issues given by our circumstances. Ortega describes a triadic movement of authentic life from chaos to theoretic reflection and back to meaningful action with genuine historical awareness (1963a, p. 23). The social as emergent. Ortega is explicit about the emergent nature of social reality: "when we want to cross the street and the traffic policeman, with a dignified and even prescriptively hieratic gesture, stops us from doing so . . . makes us start with surprise. ... So here, we say to ourselves, is something entirely new . . ." (1963a, p. 179). His analysis moves from individual life to the interindividual reality of social interaction, which is not, however, social reality in the strict sense. The social is known in opposition not to the individual, but to the interindividual. The policeman's hieratic gesture causes pedestrians to stop in mid-step, not because of interindividual relationships with him, but because such a gesture has the sui generis reality of social usages (usos). A usage "imposes itself on them. Because of this the social in its entirety is a different reality from the individual" (1963a, p. 267). Ortega clarified the emergence of social reality in analyses of "hard" and "soft" usages such as power, greetings, art, and especially language, the primordial symbol system. Language is a system of usages that belong to no one and thus can be used by everyone to make individual beliefs publically intelligible. Ortega stated that language is "a science . . . the elemental knowledge which I receive from the community . . . and which then imposes on me an interpretation of things" (1969, p. 99). Because thought is linked to the "science" co-given with a language, individual beliefs make sense in terms of an underlying "public opinion"-That is, the worldview from which all social meaning is generated, and not the ephemeral opinion of the pollsters. Worldviews are imposed on individuals without their conscious acceptance; They are a totally social reality. Integral to a worldview is its "reason." The fallacy of rationalists is to absolutize their one kind of reason as somehow outside history or social life. Ortega, however, argues that reason is a function of life, not the reverse. Humans have the imaginative power to construct various kinds of fantasy, of which reason is one. Humans are just as much irrational as rational, just as much nonsapient as sapient. Western overemphasis on rationality is a dangerous error which ignores the obvious fact that humans are historical and social, not only rational. History assumes life, not rationality. Adequate understanding of life depends on a recently discovered form of reason, namely historical reason (Ortega 1984). Method and form of knowledge of social reality. Phenomenological analysis of personal experience is the first step toward historical reason. Ortega often invited his audiences to begin analysis with an interpretation of their immediate circumstances (e.g., his lecture on theater, 1975b, pp. 163-95). As he was wont to say, we analyze our situation by moving around ourselves in our imagination and interpreting what we see, hear, smell, touch, and so on. Next we move out to a larger circle of social institutions and beliefs from which we see the wider meaning of our situation. Finally we move to the circle provided by a systematic understanding of history and interpret our experiences, social 81</page><page sequence="11">institutions, and beliefs from the most inclusive perspective continuous with human life as the starting point. Ortega insisted that knowledge is perspectival. He found evidence for this view in his interpretations of Einstein's theoretical innovations, of modem art, and of literary genres, especially the novel (1961, 1968, 1972). Cutting across institutional domains, Ortega developed the "method of generations," in which he used a life-cycle model of cohort analysis to understand the perspectives from which the young, the middle-aged, and the aged generations typically interpret the world (1961, 1962). The method of the generations provides a model for understanding historical dynamics and for relating group perspectives to biological life. In addition to the early influence of phenomenology (1987; Silver 1978), Ortega stayed close to biological ways of thinking. From the beginning of his scholarly life, Ortega affirmed that his vocation was to "clarity." Until the end of his life he worked to establish the study of culture, humanities, and science at the highest level in Spain. Through it all, he struggled for a deeper understanding of life. This understanding must be true both to the immediate experience of the individual and to the widest system of history. Ortega's life's project is essential if contemporary humanity is to work its way out of the crisis that threatens the existence of the life whose crisis it is. Such is the demand posed by vital, historical reason as both the form and the goal of the quest for clarity. Key moral value. A person's central moral value derives from the lifetime quest. In his first book, Ortega says that he wrote out of love (1963b): such love is not for individual gain, but for salvation. He uses evocative religious language, but with a secular purpose. He seeks to understand the crisis of contemporary Spanish, European, and (by implication) worldwide society, and exhorts the young of all ages and nations to do the same. Life in the widest and most personal senses must come together somehow in historical action. Historical action demands a genuine historical attitude; it calls for the heroism of which everyone is capable; it is life-enhancing action (see Weigert 1983). Life-enhancing action derives from the differentia specifica of the human animal, namely truth seeking. "Life without truth is unlivable . . . one would have to classify man as a Wahrheitsfresser (a veridivore) and not a carnivore" (Ortega 1975b, p. 51). Truth leads the authentic person to act at the level of critical contemporary issues. Ortega was not advocating superficial relevance; historical action must flow from a deep understanding of circumstances. No personal gain, party line, national interests, or ideological commitment should dictate action. The individual must take responsibility by facing the crisis, reflecting on self amidst circumstances, and acting heroically in pursuit of life-enhancing truth. Without ceasing to be Spanish and European, Ortega argued for action in pursuit of "ultranational" goals (1966, 9:266). He wanted to pass beyond merely "international" goals because these still rested on the self-interests of nations. The present human crisis demands the emergence of an ultranation to claim the allegiance and authentic action of heroic individuals. Such is the ultimate vision to which the quest for truth amidst circum- stances brought him. Alfred Schutz (1899-1959) Paradigmatic formulation. Life is an experienced field of action in which biography unfolds in a social context (Schutz and Luckmann 1973, 1989; see Schutz 1966, pp. 116- 32, 1982). Life-world is immediately available as socially meaningful experience. As such, it is potentially available for scientific analysis. Schutz shifted the focus of pheno- menology from objects of consciousness to everyday life and action. Everyday life is 82 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="12">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY organized around individuals' bodies in a spatially, temporally, and socially structured situation that is basic for interpreting experience (e.g., the "somatic feeling of life," 1982, pp. 83ff). The social world is present not primarily as an object of consciousness, but as a field of action. Humans "gear into" and "come to grips" with the world. Everyday life is a pragmatic enterprise. People choose a course of action according to systems of relevancies that are socially imposed and biographically preselected. Individuals endow behavior with meaning by integrating it into a project and a life plan. The meaningful world is both a resource and an obstacle. Domination, change, and struggle are intrinsic to life. Relevancies organize the world into sets of relationships to action and they potentially connect objects, because anything may become relevant once a course of action is chosen. Action is the key to understanding everyday life, the subject matter of sociology. The natural attitude of everyday life presents a mundane world produced perceptually by the typification of consciousness, and historically by socially distributed stocks of knowledge. Typification involves "suppression of the primes" (Schutz 1962, p. 21)-that is, abstraction from irrelevant particular features of objects. It results in an objective world irreducible to the reality of any individual as such. Typical events appresent a shared world that is not a succession of meaningless particulars or anonymous general events. Typicality makes sense against the background of its own limits. The typical can become problematic; everyday life as typical until further notice yields to the notice that is given, sooner or later, in everyone's life. In biographical projects, notice is carried by the ultimate source of anxiety, death itself. Inherent in the typification process is the awareness that the world constantly puts one's plans on notice. Reflexivity illuminates the constructed nature of the world; everyone is tied to circumstances that are problematic, yet typified. Indeed, they are problematic because they are typified and are not physical facts. The dialectic of the typical and problematic is experienced as that of familiarity and strangeness. Life is acting amidst my circumstances, familiar against the background of their potential strangeness. At times these circumstances become strange, even though I struggle to fit them into my plans. Faced with strangeness, an individual must give meaning to these circumstances and locate self within them. To give meaning is to reflect on past experience, to typify it and the present circumstances, and to assess its relevance for a plan of action. Through action, strangeness is appropriated and made familiar, at least for a time. The natural attitude of mundane consciousness creates anonymity. Perception grasps typical phenomena against typical backgrounds, and within anonymous frameworks of experience. Recipe knowledge acquired through anonymous predecessors and contempo- raries guides mundane action. Life bears the stamp of anonymity, yet it is marked by intimacy; it is mine and yours and ours. Anonymous events are related to personal biographies, and this relatedness makes them unique to my life or yours. Action is never only of a type, but is also part of a reflective life; even intimate acts have a typicality that makes them potentially public. Anonymity is constructed from intimacy grounded in the We-relationship. In a social phylogenetic sense, intimacy generates anonymity. Yet intimacy is realized in relationship to anonymization. Anonymity is not dehumanized alienation. Rather, the foundational dialectic of the individual and the social is typically experienced as the oscillation of the familiar and the strange in the dialectic of the anonymous and the intimate. Typification unites the social and the personal in meaningful action made possible through the processes that inform life and thought, and that generate the individual and the social. The distinguishing feature of social existence. The distinguishing feature of human life is the capacity to construct meanings as diverse as the structure of individual consciousness 83</page><page sequence="13">or the development of historical collectivities. Humans come to know a world with prepredicative meaningful structures; we are bor into an already meaningful world (Schutz 1967). Historically, the world is a product of institutional and temporal meanings generated by predecessors and contemporaries. Meaning construction involves reflecting on past actions and projecting future action. Typified constructions undergird the "in order to" motives that organize future action (Schutz 1967; Weigert 1975b). The extent to which meaning is the focus of attention is affected by the efficaciousness of socially typified and biographically relevant pragmatic motives. Meanings, however, are not limited to typifications. Reflexivity and situatedness enable individuals to construct meanings and pursue actions that diverge even radically from existing types. Indeed, the dialectical relationship between person and world guar- antees atypicality. Strangeness, problematics, and intimacy are structured into situations and eventually give notice that meaning is an ongoing production. Beside the possibility of relatively free action, Schutz emphasizes meanings that tran- scend everyday life (see Schutz and Luckmann 1989). This emphasis involves symbols that relate everyday life to transcendent realities with different cognitive styles and systems of relevance (Schutz 1962, pp. 329-56). Symbols are meanings that link everyday life to realities which are appresented in the mundane world. Moreover, meanings that exist in other realms can motivate actions in the everyday world, in the manner of Don Quixote (Schutz 1964, pp. 135-58). Although other realities are accompanied by a shock of recognition such as that experienced as the theater curtain rises, they enter normal life as poetry, science, daydreaming, or fantasy Symbolization gives humans the ability to move fantastically beyond gestural responses or conventional symbols into the potentially infinite. The social as emergent. Schutz grounds the social in intersubjectivity within the natural attitude. Prepredicatively, intersubjectivity presumes a reciprocal orientation of one actor to another; sociohistorically, it is empirically available in objectivated realities; existen- tially, it is the continual achievement of face-to-face interaction. The ideal form of such interaction is the "pure We-relationship" in which experience "is genuinely shared" (Schutz 1964, p. 30). The We-relationship is the basic form of sociality and the foundation of objectified social reality which, in principle, is traceable to face-to-face interaction. Schutz weaves two enigmatic themes into the We-relationship. First, it is the arational element in rela- tionships among consociates, and it belongs to a finite province of meaning other than everyday life (1962, pp. 32, 353-54). The arationality of the We-relationship, and thus of the social itself, derives from the prepredicative orientation, which involves direct, unreflective experience of others. Before reflection, there is no rational meaning, only a stream of consciousness of mutual presence (Schutz 1967, 1982). The transformation of the arational We-relationship into a rational relationship requires a leap of faith and the trust that standpoints are as interchangeable as they appear, and that differences are irrelevant. The emergent typicality of the world totters on this arational foundation. The second enigmatic theme is that the We-relationship both originates in the everyday world and transcends it. Individual meanings, qua individual, are transcended symbolically in that the particulars of the situation also appresent the social (Schutz 1962, p. 318). Schutz offers the idea of "partnership" as a general form of the We-relationship (1962, pp. 353-54). Institutionalizing partnership results in sets of relationships such as home, marriage, neighborhood, school, business, and state. These institutionalized relations belong to what William James called the world of ideal relations: interactional meanings in terms of symbols of realities that transcend everyday life and yet motivate action within it. The individual appresents the social. 84 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="14">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY Social reality is a web of symbols linking the mundane world with transcendent realities. Everyone is born into a prestructured world in which different stocks of knowledge constitute the "relative natural worldview" that renders individual reality plausible. Every- day life emerges as individuals enact typical courses of action based on recipe knowledge. This "first-level" emergence does not end with reciped repetition, however. What is taken for granted can become problematic, and the normal suddenly may appear implausible. Problematic situations point to a "second level" of realities appresented in the situation. Individuals encounter limits to the commonsense world, and in response they construct other realities. Everyday objects may symbolize meanings beyond common sense. Indeed, mundane action can be motivated by symbols whose meanings exist in another realm of reality irreducible, even contradictory, to everyday life. Communication and action occur in the everyday world; other provinces of meaning are not totally divorced from it, nor are they solipsistic (1964, pp. 136ff). For Schutz, Don Quixote remains forever relevant: everyday life is the paramount reality, but it is not a monolithic reality. Transcendent schemes of interpretation are available. Typical strategies exist for living transcendent realities. "Enclaves" combining the mundane and the transcendent can be established within a subuniverse of discourse or differentiated biography. It is possible to inhabit different realities through faith in the other-that is, through trusting that self and other can construct what then they take to be real and meaningful. The transcendent emerges from the everyday and acts on it in turn. Sancho Panza's common sense pretends not to notice Don Quixote's symbolic world; yet even Sancho is confronted by it. Schutz views the individual as faced with a fundamental choice: whether to live solely within the everyday or to struggle to transcend it, and he believes that searching unexplored regions seems "desirable or even necessary" (1970, p. 131). Method and form of knowledge of social reality. The early Schutz argued the relevance of Husserl for clarifying philosophical assumptions underlying Weber's sociology. Phen- omenology complements social science by systematic investigation of the structures of the lifeworld and consciousness. Everyday life is foundational for other realities because it is the province of meaning from which communication and action originate and to which they return. Provinces of meaning such as science or history derive from and remain grounded in mundane knowledge. This grounding is "praxic"-that is, when all is said and done, other provinces of meaning are tied to the actions and experiences of historical persons and are realized through their lives (see McLain 1981; McLain and Weigert 1979). Other symbolic realms both transcend and enhance everyday life. Knowledge is shaped along lines of a "praxic symbolism," through which humans struggle to synthesize multiple realities with each other and with the paramount reality of everyday life. Such knowledge would be common property; it would be rational. There is no ontological basis, however, for final priority among multiple realities. Each finite province of meaning has its system of relevancies for discerning priority in relation to specific problems and interests. In its province, sociology combines an objective, scientific standpoint; a grounding in universal and a priori features of human life; and allowance for historical events and the situatedness of knowledge. The enterprise tries to grasp the structures of everyday life and the symbolic forms that transcend it. Sociology, of course, is a symbol system as well. Schutz accepts positivistic postulates such as logical consistency and empirical obser- vation not restricted to mere sense data (1962, pp. 63-65). Social science is objective in that the scientist substitutes the relevance system of a detached "scientific situation" for that of the biographically situated actor. In addition, the social scientist forms types to grasp actors' meaning structures. This principle of subjective interpretation addresses the serious question in the methodology of the social sciences: "How is it possible to form 85</page><page sequence="15">objective concepts and an objectively verifiable theory of subjective meaning-structures?" (Schutz 1962, p. 62; see Grathoff 1978, p. 105). Schutz's solution follows a Weberian methodology of ideal types of action and actors. He goes further, however, and insists on a postulate of adequacy which requires that "the typical construction be compatible with the totality of both our daily life and our scientific experience" (Schutz 1964, p. 88, 1962, p. 44). Everyday actors construct meaningful action by following the first-level typifications of their worlds. Social scientists struggle to grasp that already typified world by constructing second-level typifications. The pos- tulate of adequacy pinpoints the essential difference between the physical and the social sciences. The physical world is not already meaningful through its own typifications, as is the human social world. Social scientists, except for total determinists, accept some postulate akin to that of adequacy. Although Schutz's formulation is underdeveloped, it is a solid theoretical foundation that places dialogue between everyday actors and social scientists at the center of the social science enterprise (McLain 1981). Social science is a self-correcting and socially enlightening project for the persons whose lives are its subject matter. Key moral value. Schutz's themes of multiple realities, symbolism, and transcendence ground his moral vision. He believes it is desirable to explore multiple realities and to understand their capacity for transcending everyday life. Phenomenology and social sci- ence exemplify the life-comprehending attitude of his theoretical vision. His value config- uration involves the public exploration of and respect for other realities, the transcendence of the taken-for-granted limits of everyday life, and the development of an expanding mutual understanding free from narrow common sense. Because multiple realities constitute and appresent the range of human life, their exploration leads to its enhancement. Understanding multiple realities and the groups that carry them helps to construct a more universal and more rational commonsense world. The moral quest motivates individuals to strive for heroism, no matter how foolish they look to commonsense eyes or how tragic their disillusionment (consider Don Quixote). The call to moral action leads inevitably to tragedy because moral vision is a reality that contradicts mundane life. This call involves a dialectic between the commonsense and the uncommonsense, between the everyday and the heroic. Perhaps the basic moral imperative is that society be structured to provide everyone with a chance for self-realization (Schutz 1964, p. 273). PRELIMINARY CODIFICATION OF VITAL REALISM To be sure, there are other theorists whose vital realist strains call for codification (e.g., Rochberg-Halton 1989). Such work lies outside this paper, however. Our task is a prelim- inary but (we hope) suggestive codification of the three theorists. We now present dimen- sions of a vital realist perspective and note areas of complementarity and difference that appear important and fruitful. We have no pretension to completeness. In fact, we propose that development of this perspective requires interpretive and critical elaboration of the dimensions we identify. Discussion of each dimension ends with a proposition that tries to capture the central claim. The first dimension affirms the central principle of vitalism. 1. The Concept of Life As primary, the idea of life is taken in opposition to simple consciousness or mere nature as the starting point for an empirical sociology. Dimension 1 rejects the idealism and materialism that have dominated Western thought since the Kantian revolution and recalls 86 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="16">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY an earlier axiom characteristic of Aristotelian objectivism, namely primum est vivere. In addition, the proposition gives primacy to action as the object of analysis. Our theorists nuance the understanding of life somewhat differently. Mead thinks of social life within an evolutionary process that is knowable philosophically and scientifically and is given emergent meaning by our responses. It embodies the same principles of action at all levels; yet, human action is not reducible to the behavior of merely biologic individuals. Ortega sees life more as a personal reality rooted in solitude. Contemplating human life brings the realization that it must be understood philosophically and historically, and then enacted alertly. Schutz sees life experientially as structured into a pregiven, intersubjective, and largely anonymous world of everyday life, with all that the term life implies for him. The "life-world" is subject to multiple interpretations; sociological inter- pretations must be grounded empirically and philosophically, and geared into the world of work. The three theorists agree that methodologically no analysis can exhaust life; some kind of empiricism is necessary in combination with an adequate philosophical base. Their substantive claims suggest that sociological understanding of the life concept must account, within an evolutionary framework, for both its intersubjective and its solitary character, for both the collective and the personal. In light of these methodological and substantive riders, the first proposition of vital realism is this: Life is primary. The underlying paradigm must be general enough to include these features and sufficiently specific to generate applications to the human condition. These desiderata lead to the second dimension. 2. Organism-Environment Interaction The seminal paradigm of vital realism is organism-environment interaction. This paradigm emerged strongly in the nineteenth century with the rise of evolutionary thinking. Mead (1934) developed it explicitly in his elaboration of the mind-self-society process. Phylo- genetically, human organisms arose directly from the evolutionary processes that generate all life. Ontogenetically, individual humans arise from the same social processes, but in an environment that is now symbolic as well as physical. The socialized human organism acquires a symbolic system which qualitatively changes the selectivity of its perspective on the environment so powerfully that humans are part of two evolutionary realities: one physical from the past, the other symbolic toward the future. Mead related the two realities with constructs such as adjustment, reconstruction, and adaptation, which have a meliorist tone, as though evolution were progress. Ortega appreciated the fundamental biological reality of the human condition. His interests, however, focused on a historical rendition of organism-environment interaction. First, he rejected versions of an essential or determinative human nature from theological, philosophical, or biological sources. Then, through historical reflection, he noted ways in which human life was limited by geographical conditions and how it created technological means to overcome these limitations, up to a point. He remained opposed to progressivist readings of history, however, and his strong personalist leanings warned constantly of the danger of losing self in the social or historical environment. Schutz illuminated the organism-environment paradigm as a constant phenomenological creation of cognitive actors. He saw the phenomenological relevance of both historical and physical perspectives on environment. The natural attitude of everyday life is organized around the biological imperative that I must grow old and die, the physical imperative that my body defines the point of my gearing into the world, and the historical imperative that I am born into a world that is already interpreted. Schutz recognized the importance of Mead's emphasis on manipulatory experience as well as the convergences with Ortega's 87</page><page sequence="17">historical types (e.g., Wagner 1983, pp. 139, 141). We believe that Schutz emphasized correctly a shared paradigm of organism-environment interaction that includes biological, historical, and phenomenological realities, which remain irreducible even as they emerge from the same evolutionary process. According to vital realism, sociological analysis is grounded in organism-environment interaction. The inseparability of organism from environment demands sociology's atten- tion to the political issues raised by Mead, the place of physical and social environments in the organization of human consciousness, and the threats to self posed by these environments and by any progressivist assumptions. Against this background we offer a second proposition: The paradigm of vital realism is organism-environment interaction. The irreducibility of human life derives from the capacity for reflexive imaginings. Such reflexivity universalizes experience in that it generates symbols-a specific and generative feature of human life. 3. Human Consciousness as an Emergent Symbolic Process The theorists emphasize the processual and functional features of consciousness rather than formal properties. The process becomes self-aware through the use of symbols. Symbols, furthermore, are totally social in origin, efficacious in content, and realistic in outcome. Indeed, the structures of consciousness are discovered only by analyzing human life, not the reverse. As a symbolic process, consciousness is essentially social. Mead's significant symbol, Schutz's multiple finite provinces of meaning, and Ortega's beliefs are symbolic realities that derive from the social organization of life and serve to interpret it. Individual life becomes conscious through the a priori symbolic reality that presents mundane meanings and simultaneously mediates the cultural worldview and the consciousness of others. Individuals are connected intentionally and behaviorally through social means. Each person's self-consciousness therefore is mediated to self by social means as well. Para- doxically, immediate experience-namely concomitant awareness of self in action-is possible only through social symbols. In addition, the content of that self-awareness derives from the sociohistorical meanings available during our lifetimes. Individuals become conscious of self by enacting and internalizing symbols presented in primary socialization. Through symbols, individual life becomes real and is known as real, in the double sense of "realized." We believe that each theorist reinforces these common themes, and that each grounds them differently. Mead links consciousness to specific developmental events and symbolic capacities. Ortega distrusts beliefs about self and social reality which are not subjected to historical reason that is capable of revealing, for example, the overrationalistic versions that he inherited. Philosophically, Schutz is unconcerned about developmental stages or historical contexts. He seeks instead to understand how the immediacy of the We-rela- tionship appresents the social, how the intimate gives rise to the anonymous, how other symbolic realities emerge from the paramount reality of everyday life. These multiple realities are transcendent symbol systems that nevertheless bear on everyday interpretations. A vital realist sociology works to integrate these interactional, historical, and phenom- enological approaches into a third proposition: Human consciousness is an emergent symbolic process that remains grounded in organism-environment interaction. The social, as a second-level reality made real in the act of knowing or believing it, is a perennial theme in sociology. It is a theme of subjective realism that understands reality as constituted through historical, stratified, and dialectical processes. 88 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="18">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY 4. Realization of Human Consciousness in the Life Process Reason, thought, and their derivations in science, literature, architecture, and the like are accomplishments of consciousness at work in the world. From our perspective, these products are interpreted not as ends in themselves but as means to evolutionary and moral viability. Humans do not live to think; they think to live. The process and products of consciousness are interpreted in the context of life and action, not the other way around. In this context, values are theoretically immanent; vital realist sociology eschews the twin illusions that we can free understanding from values and that relativism provides a license to ignore them. It is easy to state the dialectical primacy of life and action over conscious- ness and thought, but it is devilishly difficult to construct adequate theories about life and selfhood. It remains an open question whether a science of the person or social life is possible in principle, but the effort must be made. Dimension 4 makes a double assertion. First, it bases sociological reflection on con- scious life as the primary analogue. This process invites questions about assuming the primacy of life and the methods for arriving at an emergent reality derived from but not reducible to organic life, namely consciousness. Our theorists point to processes such as interaction, language, history, and socialization as empirical steps toward understanding how "mere" life gives rise to symbols and consciousness that remain irreducible to it. Second, Dimension 4 suggests a value primacy for species life derived from the collective nature of consciousness, action, and life. A hierarchy of values based on the primacy of species life becomes relevant at the interface between social interpretation and moral reflection. An adequate sociology is prerequisite to adequate moral knowing. No conclusion from a restricted or a priori consciousness, for example, may be taken as a reason for terminating life at the phylogenetic or species level without the consent of all affected. One may morally give up one's life for a personal ideal, but one may not morally destroy everyone else's life for that ideal. This is one instance of the implications shared by sociological reflection and by larger moral issues facing contemporary society. A fuller elaboration of vital realism would lead to other implications. The point remains: consciousness, action, and life are linked in a dialectical process paralleled by individual life and social reality. The philosophical approaches of Mead, Ortega, and Schutz need further exploration to work out the implication of these links. Mead's pragmatist formulation of consciousness and action as problem solving, Ortega's location of consciousness and action in historical circumstances that can elicit heroic action, and Schutz's insistence that everyday life is a field of action, but action that can be motivated by other realities transcending the mundane, together raise fruitful questions concerning these links. Although they approach the issue of values from different angles, they agree that thought alone cannot arrive at values, and that action immediately implicates values. Given the primacy of life, we believe they would agree that action and value are ultimately species issues. Thus we assert the general proposition: Human consciousness is realized dialectically in the life process. 5. The Emergent and Symbolic Quality of Social Reality Social reality has two foci that coexist in mostly hidden tension, namely life and symbol. As the result of an evolving natural history, humans bring a species structure to the task of sustaining life. The debate as to whether species structure determines human action and social organization waxes and wanes-for example, in the sociobiology debate. Awareness of environmental and ecological systemics is enlarging the debate. No one 89</page><page sequence="19">denies that human life is organized and that there are restrictions on the kinds of action that sustain species survival. These restrictions imply that human organisms contain "enabling" structures which also place limits on social organization and culture. It is the task of philosophical anthropology, sociobiology, and other disciplines at the interface of biology, consciousness, and society to clarify these domains. Our theorists' perspectives have implications for these issues, but they concentrate on the symbol focus of social reality. This is the focus we intend by the term social in Dimension 5. In no way do we limit the relevance of environmental and biological sciences. Our theorists emphasize the perceptual moment in the constitution of social action. Mead identified perception as one phase in the social act; Ortega formulated a phenomen- ology of perception; and Schutz's relevance systems and apperception clarified how we know. These emphases converge on the importance of signs and symbols. Because each theorist used these two terms somewhat differently, we restrict ourselves to symbol. It refers to human reconstructions of stimuli; these reconstructions function within social action as patterns, motives, or explanations guiding organisms' actions into the future or within the merely imagined. Each theorist arrived at what we may call a "symbolic realism" based on the following principles: Symbols are essentially social in origin and nature; that is, they are not derived from divine, idealistic, or biological sources. Symbols are emergent from and in tension with the biological imperatives of life. Symbols are historical realities. Symbols have layers of meaning and are interrelated in a variety of ways. One must interpret symbols in terms of the layers of meaning in order to understand human life adequately. Sociology is one perspective from which to understand symbols. As a dialectically conflated reality, symbol is constituted through human knowing; yet it is an objective reality outside the knower that influences action and enters social structures. This dialectical reality is indicated by lexical extensions of the term realize, as in "Humans realize social institutions in everyday interaction" (see Berger and Luckmann 1966). To realize is to make real and to understand, as well as to change socially less "real" objects into those that are more so, as in making land into territory or plastic into money. So humans "realize" culture as well as themselves by acting in typical ways for typical motives. This symbolic realism constitutes, expresses, and (with historical irony) threatens life. Historical and biographical irony, central to vital realism, draws on the Simmelian realization that social reality, though living and symbolic, functions as if it were a dead thing. These perspectives on the relationships among perception, symbol, reality construction, and interpretation are fertile areas of exploration for a vital realist sociology, to which each of our theorists makes substantial contributions. The role of science in the symbolic reconstruction of reality is explored with great hope by Mead and with fundamental skepticism by Ortega. Schutz systematically outlines the theoretic sociological realms of meaning, but always as only one finite province among many. Both Ortega and Schutz choose the figure of Don Quixote to represent the complex, ironic, and enigmatic (if not unknowable) relationship between humans and their symbolic realities. These issues are implicated in a fifth proposition: Social reality both emerges through life and is constructed through symbols. Dimension 6 involves the thinglike appearance of symbols as they constitute a historical version of social reality. 6. The Thinglike Character of Social Reality Our theorists, in other words, faced the Durkheimian insight. Mead conceptualized social reality as emergent objects of human interaction. Even the self is an object, a symbol SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 90</page><page sequence="20">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY eliciting joint responses from others and from self. For Ortega, the subject matter of sociology was social usages (usos) that are external, constraining, and powerful historical forces. Schutz developed typifications as taken-for-granted patterns of action, motivation, and thought that derive their reality from unquestioned assumptions constitutive of the life-world. Together these perspectives provide a trio of evaluations of social reality in relation to the individual and to normative issues about relationships between the individual and society. In other words, once the individual is introduced as a carrier of value, and once the consequences of social arrangements for the viability of human life are addressed, the theorist faces the issue of values squarely. Simply put, theorists are led to ask about the compatibility of their view of the worthy life with their conception of the social. Our theorists recognize that the social appears to be a thing; indeed, that it actually is a thing, though derivatively. The social is literally a "reified" reality-that is, a symbolic and actional reality to which humans respond as if it were a thing. Each theorist, however, nuances the thinglike reality of the social in different ways. Mead regards social reality as an object constituted by the organized actual responses of, and readiness to respond by, self and others. Yet objects function as hypotheses to be verified in action. If the action predicated on that object-as-hypothesis is inadequate, then actors reformulate the object as a different hypothesis for future action. Mead's pragmatism is manifested in this root metaphor of human life as a problem-solving, quasi-scientific enterprise. Mead adds a melioristic, democratic value: he judges the adequacy of object-as-hypothesis not merely in terms of individual goals, but (more important) in terms of increasing the scope of action until the entire world potentially is included in the attitude that informs the action. This view is his intemational-mindedness. Social reality, then, is an object as hypothesis to be verified by individuals in search of an ever more encompassing self acting for the good of all. Such is the optimism pervading Mead's intellectual struggle. Ortega presents us with an ironically pessimistic version of the individual-society relationship. His writings are filled with flashes of threat from the social and the com- monplace against the authenticity of self. He views the relationship as one of opposition and contradiction; the authenticity of human life is in the possibility of solitude. Yet the brute otherness of the social is one of the circumstances necessary for life. The individual relates to the social through an oscillation of chaotic otherness, orderly contemplation, and reasoned action in the public arena. Social usages threaten the individual with chaotic otherness (alteraci6n); those who yield are ciphers in the mass. They become that ironic contradiction in so-called advanced societies, the mass-person. Yet in spite of his pessi- mistic rendition of authenticity fighting the forces of anonymous mediocrity, Ortega spices his thinking with a jovial optimism about the power of life to overcome threat, as history has demonstrated up to this time. He does not believe in this or that nation or party, but in the historical march of virtue in the classical sense: heroic competence in the service of the good. In contrast to Ortega's moral charge and Mead's moral reconstruction, Schutz reads as a dispassionate but concerned analyst of the life-world. According to Schutz, the social confronts us as a given neutral reality. It is the realm of mundane common sense in which tragedy and comedy are enacted immediately and ultimately, the realm in which we are born, give birth, work, love, hate, sicken, and die. Schutz's goal is to make this taken- for-granted realm transparent to sharper analysis, deeper interpretation, and freer action. He shows us that the taken-for-granted can be questioned and can lead to liberation, and that the mundane is constructed by human powers which transcend any worldview. In staid fashion, Schutz holds out the prospect of enclaves and provinces of meaning in which the mundane can be transcended and our common humanity discovered. Indeed! 91</page><page sequence="21">In our judgment, Schutz would accept Mead's meliorism and Ortega's dialectic. We see his project converging with the others and moving toward a sociology adequate for understanding the valued life that they share in the midst of contemporary crises. The following proposition captures this possibility: Social reality functions as if it were a thing in opposition to life. With appropriate irony, this proposition integrates our previous dimensions: Human life, in its social and species environments, generates consciousness, action, and value that are "realized" and interpretable through the same symbolic potential that promises either extinction or viability. CONCLUSION: FROM PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO UNIVERSAL ENVIRONMENT In spite of their differences, we find Mead, Ortega, and Schutz converging on a powerful dialectical principle: Organic life is socially real. Their admiration for and reaction against the idealist tradition and the new philosophical biologies led to theoretical projects in- cluding both poles of the human condition. Each theorist posits a world independent of individual life. Each recognizes that the world as human is constituted by symbolic transformations of behavior. And each is aware that there is no guarantee that the human world will sustain life in a morally adequate way. Ortega and Schutz lived into the beginning of the atomic age and wondered, as we know for Ortega and surmise for Schutz, whether human actions paradoxically may destroy the environments from which they emerge. The convergence underlines the importance of relationships between biological condi- tions of life and ideological or institutional realities. The former make life possible and confront us as an evolving "world that is there," as personal "circumstances," and as a "world" that precedes the phenomenological "life-world." Yet the species-specific world of human life emerges from and is increasingly but finitely independent of the organismic parameters of the environments whose viability it affects in turn. Our thinkers locate the dialectic of material-social realities at theoretical center stage as the primary analogue for doing sociology. In sum, as a metatheory, vital realism offers images and constructs for a synthesis based on organism-environment interaction. Without waxing polyannaish, it is a metaphor of human unity in a competitive, ethnocentric age: we are all organisms interacting with a single shared environment-a key aspect of a realist perspective. Thus, vital realism is inherently objective and universalist in a way not shared by abstractionist theories that omit organism, environment, or their interaction. It is inclusive-indeed, formally non- territorial-because it offers a common ground. Old dichotomies such as micro-macro, subjective-objective, agency-structure, and individual-collective are invited to include natural, physical, organic, or environmental dimensions. Vital realism, rather unrestricted by received bureaucratic and disciplinary boundaries, may function as a bridging paradigm across biological, ecological, philosophical, and historical disciplines. The potential of vital realism will be realized in the work of scholars who go beyond idealist or materialist reductionism. It calls for the textual and hegemonic self-reflexivity demanded by postmodernism without accepting uncritical relativism. Vital realism sug- gests intellectual and moral foundations without philosophical foundationalism. Value issues, as long-term probabilistic outcomes, are formal theoretical elements. They are included explicitly in vital realism because value neutrality, apriorism, and relativism are 92 SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY</page><page sequence="22">VITAL REALISM AND SOCIOLOGY unacceptable theoretical stances for a critically informed perspective. This point brings theorists to recognize the fundamental irony of human action grounded in the universality of unintended, even unknown, outcomes. Life is always far more than knowledge, and thus virtue cannot be derived from what we think we know about the world, but it must be based on shared commitments, including our progeny. Irony therefore is a genuine theoretical construct and methodological tool, more like a wrench than a hammer. Vital realism teaches humility. It is one of the symbol systems that transcend everyday life, but it has no pretense of superseding that life. Thus reflexivity, both mundane and scientific, is not a concession but is central to its method of knowing. As Ortega and Schutz suggest we ought to heed the Quixotes among us. Vital realism fears absolute truth claims, but it supports a sense of certitude in our daily lives as a moral, not a scientific, achievement. Indeed, as with Mead, Ortega, and Schutz, relentless pessimism and renascent hope are working attitudes for a vital realist; they are not implicated theoretical baggage or value choices derived from some exogenous principle. If humans wreck the planet's capability to support our species, we should have been more pessimistic; if we quit in the face of danger, we ought to have cultivated hope. Adequate multidimen- sional theory teaches that both pessimism and hope are possible realizations of life and action. In concrete theoretical work, vital realist sociology suggests new analyses of institutions such as family, religion, education, and work, and of sensitizing concepts such as strati- fication, ideology, time, and geography. Species survival and environmental issues have intrinsic status in vital realism; they are not merely social problems or political causes. Analyses would include, for example, social sustainability or viability of species in the context of crucial circumstances and environmental objects, just as is occurring now in many disciplines. Such thinking opens dominant constructs-for example, the formation of economic markets-to other levels of analysis and issues. Vital realism leads to questions that cross traditional boundaries, such as relationships among occupations fer- tility dynamics, gender roles, quality of life, and ecological survival. Insofar as this exercise in synthesis has been effective, at least it suggests the plausibility and fruitfulness of recognizing that theoretical perspectives typically taken as antithetical (e.g., biological evolutionary accounts versus symbolic communicative approaches versus cognitive phenomenological versions) may share an underlying construct, namely human life. Vital realism, then, invites us to integrate organic, symbolic, and scientific perspec- tives that incorporate realist elements in a constructionist strategy. REFERENCES Alexander, Jeffery C. 1982.
