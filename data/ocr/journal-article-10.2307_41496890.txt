LOVELL Abstract: In the last 5-10 years archaeological data to support "cultic" or ritual activity amongst communities of the Chalcolithic period has expanded exponentially. Despite this , Т.Е. Levy's thesis remains the major statement on the socio-economic organisation of the Chalcolithic and has survived minimal challenge. Successfully unpicking how ritual behaviour operated and how it has been interpreted in the past requires grappling with the " mid-level theory gap " and critically reviewing implicit assumptions about both the material culture record and general cultural theory. Historiographically, ritual activity has been tied to discussions of socio-economic complexity in the Southern Levantine Chalcolithic despite the fact that very few regional studies of economic or social integration within or between sites have been presented which address how communities may have experienced or participated in such activities. With the data from three "key" sites (Gilat, En Gedi and Teleilat Ghassul) now available, a review of the current perspectives on cultic or ritual behaviour is timely. This paper reviews the existing data alongside the current syntheses and suggests some ways in which we might bring Chalcolithic communities into sharper focus. Résumé : Au cours de la dernière décennie , les informations relatives aux activités cultuelles et rituelles ont augmenté de manière exponentielle. Néanmoins , la thèse de Т.Е. Levy demeure la théorie dominante sur l'organisation socio-économique du Chalcolithique et elle n'a subi que des remises en cause minimes. Un examen attentif tant du mode opératoire des comportements rituels que de la manière selon laquelle ils ont été précédemment interprétés , nécessite à la fois de les confronter à la théorie du "mid-level gap" et une analyse critique des affirmations implicites portant sur la culture matérielle et la théorie de la culture. Par le passé, les études sur les pratiques rituelles chalcolithiques au Levant Sud ont été intégrées à la discussion sur la complexité socio-économique, nonobstant la grande rareté des études régionales, intra- et inter-sites, qui précisent comment ces communautés ont pu avoir pratiqué ces activités. Les données de trois sites clés (Gilat, En Gedi et Teleilat Ghassul) étant désormais disponibles, il est possible de faire un bilan des approches actuelles sur les comportements cultuels et rituels. Cet article examine les données disponibles, en parallèle avec les synthèses publiées, et suggère quelques directions vers lesquelles pourrait se focaliser l'approche des sociétés chalcolithiques.

We do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off. Which is a kind of integrity, if you look on every exit being an entrance somewhere else." (Player, Act 1, Line 207 from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , by T. STOPPARD) The Chalcolithic period, and the "Classic" Chalcolithic (4200-3800 ВСЕ) in particular, is one of extraordinary craft production and social ritual. There is an astonishing variety in the modes of representation on and within these objects. The existence of these remarkable objects demands explana- tion and prompted Т.Е. Levy to argue for cultic elites man- aging surplus and risk, and brandishing elaborate markers of status.1 Meanwhile, the growing body of cave burial sites with 1.

LOVELL extraordinary artefacts across the Southern Levant2 testifies to a generalised community participation in cult or ritual activity. I. Gilead has argued that the concept of a corporate religion in the Chalcolithic is a nonsense,3 nevertheless Levy's "prehis- toric patterns of pilgrimage [to] panregional temples"4 remains a powerful concept.5 This trope is echoed in P. Seaton's work where cult "locales" are believed to contain artefacts which "drew selectively from a similar iconographie and architectural menu."6 Seaton's recent publication of the Teleilat Ghassul sanctuary makes data available from the excavations at Area E, apparently one of the three key Chalcolithic cult complexes in the Dead Sea Region,7 and argues for the existence of cult specialists.8 This discussion aims to foreground the Chalcolithic com- munity as a whole in the discussion of cult, or "ritual," more generally, because examining the broader context of locales of ritual behaviour (defined below) allows a more nuanced view of past communities. This has certain implications for inter- pretations of particular houses or complexes and, by extension, the importance we give them within socio-economic recon- structions of the past. There has been considerable interest in communities within the archaeological context.9 According to the perceived anthro- pological wisdom, the development of complex social systems is supposed to coincide with "multi-community societies" and an "increased rate of inter-societal" interaction.10 This has par- ticular resonance in the Southern Levantine Chalcolithic con- text, which appears locked in a neo-evolutionary narrative.11 Levy's chiefdom model has been finessed over the years, but it still relies on the proposition that the chiefly elite managed and redistributed specialised goods (copper) and services (reli- gious/cultic rites) and a two-tier settlement hierarchy.12 Use of the chiefdom model in archaeology has been cri- tiqued by others13 and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.14 Instead, I will attempt to focus on the groups of individuals who inhabited the archaeological sites under dis- cussion, and who interacted to create the world we excavate. Addressing the community in this context requires weaving in and out of different scales of analysis. My aim is to use the available evidence to tease out different strands of community from the archaeological record. The argument followed here is that much of what has been interpreted as cult, is in fact the ritual of the everyday and rep- resents the ways in which people bound themselves to each other. But cult (or ritual) does not have to involve a deity or a chief to officiate it,15 indeed it is much more effectively viewed as community practise. Community is cult and cult is com- munity. The fact that we see the trappings of ritual in almost every context testifies to the generalised nature of ritual prac- tise across the "Classic," Late Chalcolithic, which will be the subject of this paper. COMMUNITIES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTISE What are communities and how have they been theorised in archaeology? A.B. Knapp maintains that social archaeol- ogy in the 21st century, wherever it is practised, must take into account the concept of community in order to "move beyond binary constraints."16 Current literature on the Chalcolithic assumes communities, but discusses sites. The community is the off-stage player, but is nonetheless crucial to the workings of our concept of broader cultural theory. In current discussions, the "community," which Knapp has described as the "living reality of the past,"17 is skipped over in favour of more tangible data, perhaps because many find the disjuncture between the social and the material is problematic. Providing the classic definition of the community in archaeological terms, M.J. Kolb and J.E. Snead note that to archaeologists working in formative agricultural societies, communities are seen as a particularly important social ele- ment which mediate supra-family economic and social integra- tion. Communities are said to manage defence, risk aversion, capital investment, technology and trade, and yet community remains a poorly defined concept.18 Kolb and Snead's list (three irreducible elements of human communities: social reproduc- tion; subsistence production; self identification and social 2.

They make particular note of this relationship to place: "Sedentary agricultural groups in particular create, in a very real sense, physical 'maps' reflecting social and eco- nomic relationships through direct modification of the phys- ical landscape and construction of architectural sites (houses, agricultural fields, burial mounds, etc.). The resultant cultural landscape is the spatial expression of the community, which can thus be considered 'socio-geographic.'"20 How non-sedentary groups might treat landscape is not explained, but the implication is that studies of community which are able to locate multiple actors in a similar activity in a certain place will possibly be the most effective studies of community. Even when archaeologists have taken an imagined community perspective - like Knapp's study of a Bronze Age mining community at Politiko Phorades 21 - these are inevita- bly linked to landscape and "place." The explanatory power of studies of archaeological community is therefore dependent upon effective separation of the chronological layers to reveal contemporary interactions with landscape and place. M.A. Canuto and J. Yaeger contend that the definition of com- munity "dictates that the community be viewed as ephemeral and ever emergent."22 This appears to confound archaeological identification23 but the concept of an "imagined" archaeologi- cal community (following B. Anderson)24 has become a pow- erful one within archaeological scholarship.25 Essentially, the two definitions of community, the classic and the imagined, intersect at place . There can be no effective archaeological study of community without an understanding of cultural and physical context. However, communities are narrations , com- munities are stories. In a prehistoric context, we are therefore at an extreme disadvantage. Essentially we need to be able to detect to what extent stories were shared across the landscape, inside and outside settlements, over time.

THE CHALCOLITHIC OF THE SOUTHERN LEVANT AND CULT Previous discussions of cult in the Chalcolithic have relied upon demonstrating the existence of central, regional foci,26 albeit in concert with anthropological data.27 With further detail about the precise nature of the sites now available28 (fig. 1) we are in a position to break down some previous assumptions.29 It 19.

LOVELL is also important to clarify what we term cult (the word com- monly used in discussions of prehistoric religion) is perhaps better understood as "ritual behaviour." Ritual is: "(•••) a way of reconciling everyday experience with the unknown or the unexpected. It therefore runs the gamut from the personal or individual (since Freud, ritual is regarded as an obsessional or pathological condition) to the communal, condoned and approved by a larger society or regime. At both extremes it is expressed by rules of behaviour and action; belief in a supernatural component is not mandatory (...). It is a binding social mechanism, which may explain why it is persis- tently integral to all societies, and hence a very useful means of control by whatever hierarchy (...) [It] is integral to daily expe- rience, enacted through the standard activities of daily life."30 While cult has been linked with chiefs, two-tiered soci- eties and prestige goods there has been little elaboration on how these two issues (socio-economic structure and religious authority) actually interplayed. With the exception of Itziq Gilead's work,31 discussions of ritual in the Chalcolithic context have tended toward binary discussions of the "cultic" building or artefact,32 rather than explorations of the ways in which ritu- als (the "enactment" of the spiritual, religious or cultic) was practised throughout the community. A lack of focus on the nature of the domestic context allows cultic localities and, by extension, cultic personages (chiefs) to be created and reified without any clear comparative data or, indeed, a community to "serve." Thus Y. Rowan and J. Golden describe the nature of the socio-economic organisation of the Chalcolithic as an "unresolved problem."33 We know that communities cut through and across such cultural landscapes - or perhaps better put, that the mate- rial culture landscape that we perceive, study and dissect as archaeologists is, in fact, multiple layers of complementary, competing and juxtaposed cultural landscapes, representing and reinforcing multiple, variably sized and non-contiguous communities. This is essentially what many mean when they use the term "culture" in archaeology34 or what O. Bar-Yosef and D. Bar-Yosef Mayer35 call "social territories." Y. Rowan and J.L. Lovell36 argue that archaeology of the late prehistoric periods in the Southern Levant has been straight-jacketed by its culture historical roots. No matter how crude and unsatisfactory the various regional divisions of the Chalcolithic might be, we know that there are regional expres- sions of material culture and we know that there was supra- household activity within the Chalcolithic. Archaeologists primarily track interaction between individuals and groups through the movement (or inferred movement) of artefacts (tracked via provenance studies and/or stylistic comparison). The dynamics of social space are then extrapolated from the complexities of these patterns, nuances are drawn from the objects themselves and the ways in which they are distributed. Long range trade is known from the Neolithic,37 but in the Chalcolithic long range trade, in a number of artefact types and raw materials, occurred with a much greater intensity. Shell from the Nile and the Mediterranean is found on settlement sites throughout the region,38 limited finds of obsidian testify to down-the-line(?) trade with Anatolia,39 and links further south in Africa may be indicated by the gold rings from Nahal Qanah.40 Regular trade between the Nile delta and Southern Israel is in no doubt41 although its frequency beyond the Beer Sheva Basin is less clear (see e.g., the Egyptian macehead at el Khawarij).42 Nevertheless, the above demonstrates that the geo-cultural setting of the Chalcolithic meta-community was dynamic and broad and this fits entirely with the preceding period where the Wadi Rabah material must have had a north- ern influence.43 We certainly know that families cooperated beyond the household. At Tabaqat Fahl (Pella) excavations demonstrate both occupation on the tell (Area XXXII) and also at a farm- stead further up the wadi (Area XIV).44 In Area XXXII, on the tell itself a series of large storage jars in a row, adjacent to a "wheat storage facility," suggest storage and production beyond a household level.45 This is a phenomenon partially reproduced at Abu Hamid,46 attesting to the general co-operative nature of Jordan Valley agricultural communities in the period. The fact that the same technological practise is found at Abu Hamid and Pella argues for networks of knowledge that travelled up and down the lateral wadis of the Southern Levant. It is reason- able to suggest that these communities operated in symbiosis with upland settlers who, according to our present evidence, 30. KINNES, 1998. 31. GlLEAD, 2002. 32. MAZAR, 2000. 33.

The seasonalities of separate agricultural/horticultural and other activities no doubt reinforced different community identities, but it is clear that these communities must have crossed and interacted. M. Burton and Т.Е. Levy have presented studies of interaction within the Negev,48 but there is considerable scope for further analysis of variability within and between sites in different ecological zones49 as well as more open, flood plains, but in lieu of this we can try to excise the individual or community patterns from regional, broad-based site patterns. THE HOUSEHOLD AND THE COMMUNITY Classic or natural communities are made up of groups of households. It has been said that a community is a level above a household and below a society/culture, although, households themselves are an ephemeral concept. While households are currently being theorised,50 they have been seen as "an essen- tial level of inquiry in order to move 'from grand theories of cultural change and evolution to the practical archaeology of potsherds and stone tools'" i.e., they bridge the "mid level the- ory gap:"51 "only when the spatial, status, gender and age relationships in the organisation and structure of households are more fully explored can the complexity and diversity of the roles of house- holds, as social and productive units in the wider community, be better understood."52 Like communities, households are not fixed, but rather fluid and shifting. However, as S.G. Souvatzi has pointed out, "a concern with definitions is important for understanding house- hold as a process" and is therefore a step along the research path.53 In examining households, we can perhaps examine con- tradictions within the broader site structure that may allow us to reconstruct communities.54 In general, reviews of Chalcolithic village and households organisation have concentrated on relationships to social complexity (i.e., hierarchy). Rowan and Golden55 note that most commentators56 view variability in size house sizes as insignificant, i.e., hierarchies are not demonstrable, although S.J. Bourke noted significant variability at Teleilat Ghassul,57 which remains the largest exposure of domestic Chalcolithic architecture. Thus discussions have been fixated on household exposures as they relate to socio-economics, rather than com- munity or interpersonal interaction. Further, in archaeologi- cal analysis, the finds from houses are typically divorced from their context, making houses buildings, rather than the poten- tial loci of households, far less the potential foci of a commu- nity or communities. The structural facets of Chalcolithic houses (broadrooms, of various sizes, constructed of local materials with flat roofs and large outer courtyards) were reviewed by Y. Porath,58 but as to contents, very little information is provided: "Typically, floors of Chalcolithic houses, regardless of their building material, were covered with a thick accumula- tion of debris containing a large amount of sherds, decomposed organic material, potsherds, discarded stone implements, bones and other food remains. It seems as if refuse was not removed from the houses in the Chalcolithic period, so that the occupa- tion level rose continuously during use."59 At Teleilat Ghassul, this typical house type is found, as are many variant forms (fig. 2). In fact, the Pontifical Bibli- cal Institute (PBI) plan of the site still represents the broadest exposure of Chalcolithic domestic architecture known. More 47.

In this respect it would be valuable to refine our studies of communi- ties by using multiple scales of analysis, specifically by looking within drainage basins. The olive producing communities of the Wadi Rayyan (LOVELL et al., 2006 and 2007) and their interaction with lowland sites would form an excellent extension to studies of Jordan Valley commu- nities, i.e., a possible window into communities that cut across sites and perhaps connect with more external factors. We presume that most ceramic production is performed at a household scale and that methods are taught and passed on within families and perhaps extended families. These communities of practise, if they could be pinned down, would then represent a series of actors who interacted on some level over a discrete and measurable timescale. It takes time to conduct such studies, just as it takes time to build up a set of comparable data from a sub region. 50. ALLISON, 1999; BLANTON, 1994; SOUVATZI, 2008. 51. WlLKE and RATHJE, 1982; cf.

The sample available to Porath was limited, and based on stone constructions, but the basic pattern of broadroom structures within courtyards still resonates in the mudbrick examples. But houses are the physical units, they are not the house- holds themselves.63 These latter are better examined in con- junction with the artefacts within them. In this sense Teleilat Ghassul (like many other Western Asian sites excavated early last century) presents us with a problem because so many of the artefacts excavated there are either unpublished, or divorced from their precise context. However, reconstructing house floors precisely is not necessarily the panacea of house- hold archaeology (and, by extension, the related study of com- munities), because the contents of a particular house does not always represent a single household at a particular point in time; it may be more likely to represent the deposit of house- holds, a community or members of communities over time. Excising the specific from an overarching pattern therefore becomes a very tricky exercise. Given the limitations of the published data, we would do better to talk in terms of grouped assemblages, while acknowledging discrepancies. Neverthe- less an exploration of the general character of the domestic is long overdue. Any full study ought to take into account all artefact types, but for the purposes of this paper we shall deal with ceramics only, because there is good data available. The following discussion focuses on sites in Southern Israel and the Southern Jordan Valley (Grar, Beer Sheva, Teleilat Ghassul), where reasonably robust data exists. Gilat64 is 60.

Allowing for differences in recording strategy, C. Commenge-Pellerin's66 useful figures on the basic forms of the Late Chalcolithic assemblages at Abu Matar compare very well to those provided by Gilead67 for Grar, and are quite close to those provided by myself for Teleilat Ghassul. The data presented here are necessarily crude measures of variability. Different ways of measuring or dividing assem- blages will, necessarily, result in different counts. Neverthe- less the close correlation of these results is striking. At all sites bowls form around 40% of the assemblage, basins just over 10%, fenestrated stands are less than 2% (although they are not measured separately at Teleilat Ghassul, these would be a por- tion of the "varia" category), and closed storage vessels make up about 35% of the assemblage, although at Teleilat Ghassul this is slightly higher (42%). Notably, the Ghassulians appear to favour the holemouth jar to the necked jar, which would appear to suggest a different cooking or storage practise east to west. Cornets, which are not found at Abu Matar or other sites in Beer Sheva, are recovered in much greater numbers at Grar (14.07%, almost twice that of Teleilat Ghassul). Cornets may 65. While there may be some overlap, newly published radiocarbon dates from Gilat (LEVY and BURTON, 2006) suggest that the Gilat sanctuary largely predates the Area E complex, where the majority of dates cluster around 4300-4200 BC (BOURKE et al ., 2004). 66.

If recent residue analysis suggesting that cornets contained beeswax (for lighting?)68 can be cor- roborated at other sites, it may be that other vessel types (small bowls?) might have served the same function at sites where cornets are not found.69 However, it is also possible that the communities of people associated with beeswax production (or whatever else cornets may have contained) did not engage with all communities across the region equally. While there is much work to be done in applying this sort of analysis at the household level (studies of floor surfaces of individual houses and courtyard assemblages would be highly desirable), these figures give us a baseline breakdown for the ceramic repertoire of Chalcolithic sites in the Dead Sea Region. The broadly similar ratios, site-to-site, presented above do not necessarily imply community interaction, but they do suggest a similar functional behaviour, and that the communities in this area shared some basic behavioural traits. This overarch- ing similarity in material culture, cut by clear regional varia- tion, is a general feature of the Chalcolithic. In this sense we are discussing communities in the "natural" sense, but we must also recognise that there are other communities which cross- cut and complement these. With this in mind, let us turn to the site of Teleilat Ghassul, where a "cultic building" has been posited, but where there is much else to inform our discussion of communities. THE DEAD SEA REGION AND CULT AREA E, TELEILAT GHASSUL The 1975-1977 seasons of J.B. Hennessy's excavations at Area E at Teleilat Ghassul involved the excavation of a complex, interpreted as a sanctuary.70 Hennessy's excavations were elabo- rated upon by Bourke's team in the 1990s.71 The complex com- prises an enclosure wall, two broadroom structures, referred to as "Sanctuaries" A and B, located just below the modern ground surface72 (fig. 3). As noted above, the excavations in Area E are 68. NAMDAR et al., 2009. 69. A group of approximately 30 cornets was discovered in a small room adja- cent to Building 78 ("Haus des Vogels"), Tell 3 (KOEPPEL, 1940: 81-82) which also contained a number of "silos" and painted decoration (fig. 4). If cornets were associated with lighting (and not with a beverage) then build- ings with wall paintings may have benefitted from additional lighting. 70. HENNESSY, 1982: 56 and 1989: 234. 71.

The complex comprised an outer wall (only partially preserved), two broadroom structures (stone founda- tions and floors, with mudbrick superstructure), and plastered and painted interior walls. Associated was an assemblage of objects that parallel other items known from sites like Gilat and En Gedi.74 The complex was destroyed by fire, sealing a group of domestic and other objects under the fallen wall material.75 Inside the enclosure, in the centre of the courtyard, a semi- circular structure was excavated, which runs around a large central stone with two ground impressions. A stone path leads from the door of Structure A, up to, and underneath the stone. An earthen surface was found to connect to Structure B. The three structures are clearly contemporary (at least in the lat- est phase). On the surface, and on the path a large number of broken ceramics (including a large proportion of fenestrated bowls/stands and cornets), ground stone and lithics were found.76 In the wider courtyard, in the north-east, the assem- blage contains a similar spread of items at a lower frequency.77 The area on the northern side of the enclosure wall is quite different in nature.78 A posited "industrial zone" (consisting of pits, silos and fragmentary architecture outside and to the north of the court- yard structure) may have been related to the buildings inside the enclosure wall, but the limited exposure ( ca 160 m3)79 did not run up to the posited gate in the north-western corner and, from the descriptions and plans, the remains appear ephemeral.80 We have already seen that the architectural form of Chal- colithic buildings in general is quite similar to the complex in Area E. Neither its form, nor the fact that it had multiple phases sets it apart from other complexes at the site. The Gilat archi- tectural form is not easily comparable, although the En Gedi complex shares similar features. Given its similarity to many other complexes in other areas of Teleilat Ghassul, it is difficult to see how the architectural form itself made this particular space "special." Even wall paintings are found in a number of other buildings across the site81 and indeed at other sites (e.g., Abu Hamid.)82 Table 4 - Ceramic data from Teleilat Ghassul , Area E (after SEATON, 2008 : table 1.18). INSIDE THE AREA E COMPLEX Although the assemblage from Teleilat Ghassul does appear to depart from other domestic assemblages at the site, many of the finds in themselves conform to general "domestic" items. The figures provided by Seaton83 for the proposed sanctuary at Teleilat Ghassul, Area E (table 4) do differ from the average breakdown for the later phases of Teleilat Ghassul (see table 3); however what are lacking is the larger storage items (holem- ouths, basins, etc.) that would be expected in a sanctuary area focusing on some aspect of redistribution. These, it is argued, are to be found north of the Area E complex, over the wall. A consistent feature of the Area E assemblage is the large number of cornets (11.45%), more than 4% higher than the norm for the site (but lower than the overall average at Grar and significantly lower than the available figures from En Gedi, see table 5) and a larger percentage of varia but, as stated above, there are also a number of standard artefacts which are habitu- ally aligned with domestic assemblages including chipped stone, ground stone, faunal material and worked bone.84 COMPARABLE DATA SETS Parallels with En Gedi are extremely seductive because of the similarity in architectural features.

LOVELL Table 5 - Ceramic data from En Gedi (after USSISHKIN, 1980 : table 1.18 , based on number of sherds). above) also conforms to a general pattern in domestic architec- ture.85 The vast majority of the En Gedi ceramics analysed by Y. Goren were local, while some seem to belong to the Judean mountains or Beer Sheva Basin/Shepelah area.86 Overall the site has the appearance of a particularly well-maintained desert station or meeting place, perhaps for pastoralists who worked in this region.87 The anthropomorphic/zoomorphic vessels found at En Gedi and Gilat are powerful images that beg for an explana- tion. Finds from Teleilat Ghassul, in particular fragments of figurines, termed "Gilat-type hands"88 and a zoomorphic vessel,89 have prompted Seaton to argue for a sacred pairing of bovine and female imagery within cultic contexts across the region.90 She links these to the figurines and vessels known from Gilat and En Gedi, and indeed beyond. This writer is more cautious about invoking J. Cauvin,91 but it is certainly true that Chalcolithic imagery has long inspired concepts of fertility and or polytheism.92 Interpreting what these images meant is stretching the evidence, and whether different groups, in quite different contexts, interpreted or used them in the same way is almost impossible to know. The Gilat vessels, with which the Area E are compared, were quite possibly of very different dates and the connections drawn between them may be invalid - stylistic comparisons may not imply similar meanings over such chron- ological distance. At other sites zoomorphic figurines, principally at Abu Hamid,93 come reportedly from "mundane" areas of the site.94 Whatever the past reality, it is clear that Area E, while per- haps presenting a little differently to other areas at the site, was also, very much "in keeping" with a site inhabited by dynamic and creative individuals. It was not the only complex with wall paintings, and the amulets and ceramics recovered from in the building are also found across the site in other contexts. In fact, there are parallels for the Area E complex closer to home. In the original excavations by the PBI in the late 1920s and 1930s large exposures of architecture were revealed in Tell 1 and Tell 3 (figs. 4-5). While the published reports95 do not allow us to tie specific artefacts to particular find spots, the detailed plan of Tell 3 (fig. 4) does provide a good amount of detail on house fixtures and features. From this plan we note a variety of buildings, with various phases, rebuilds and addi- tions (grouped loosely into the PBI's Substrata I Va and IVb). The figure 4 shows these features represented schemati- cally. Notable among them are a large collection of painted walls (amongst them some of the more famous frescoes from Teleilat Ghassul), hearths, horseshoe shaped installations, infant/neonate burials, stone platforms and jar stands. Notable among these is Room 10, containing the etoille fresco.96 Only a few meters away from this house is a horseshoe shaped installation in an open courtyard. In fact, frescoes are found throughout the site, including one in Area A, in an earlier, Phase D, building.97 As noted above, although they are cer- tainly a ritual associated with the Area E complex, wall paint- ings/decoration are not necessarily a marker of cult, and are also found at other sites, e.g., Abu Hamid98 and Hujayrat al-Ghuzlan.99 Like cornets, they appear to be widespread.100 85.

There are approximately a dozen fragments and paintings noted by the early PBI team and additional fragments noted by R. North from their Levels III and IV. More have been found by Hennessy's team and by Bourke's (Phases D-A). Of course, there may have been more paint- ings at Teleilat Ghassul, and we cannot be sure that paintings were not missed by the PBI team, especially from the earliest seasons in Tells 1-2. Importantly, perceived clusters on the plan now may reflect differ- ent skills of the excavators involved at the time. It is clear from their own descriptions that they found these difficult to see: "Ал der Westseite von C3 stehend , sah ich morgens am 10. Dez. 1931 den Verputz an der Mauer und machte P.

REGISTERS OF RITUAL PRACTISE- AREA Q, TELEILAT GHASSUL "Archaeological analysis should not be about the mapping of a static social order as if it represented some cosmological or structural rule, but rather about considering the ways agen- cies found places for themselves in the contexts of their own world."102 The plan of Tell 1, Teleilat Ghassul (fig. 5), presents yet another similar architectural pattern, and as in Tell 3, numer- ous children, infants and neonate burials, the oldest of which is said to have been 7-8 years.103 This latter individual was found in Maison 26. Clusters of infant burials (buried in pits below floors or walls) are also known from Tell 3. Burials like this are found across the site, including in more recent excavations southern exposures.104 Ca 41 such burials are known from the site as a whole, including several in pits below walls in Area Q. Infant or neonate burials have been largely ignored in the lit- erature while the extra-mural adult cemeteries are more widely discussed. In this complex, compared in architectural form to Maison 2 and 26 in Tell 1 by Bourke et al.,105 the team discov- ered a series of miniature vessels/objects in association with the burials in the western room.106 The practise of burying neo- nates and infants in such a way is not unknown in the Levant, nor from ethnographic contexts, however the association with miniature vessels is an aspect of ritual behaviour that has not been observed elsewhere and represents a particular register of ritual practise in the Chalcolithic. Area Q, on the eastern edge of the excavated area of Teleilat Ghassul, was excavated in 1997 and 1999 by Bourke's Univer- sity of Sydney team.107 A complex of broadroom architecture was exposed - the structure contained many small rooms. 101.

Attached to the larger room was a small room 1 ( с a 3 X 1.5 m) that contained 3 contexts with human bone deposits108 (fig. 5). Two of these deposits (Features 4 and 16) were found within mudbrick installations, with pieces of stor- age jar, or cooking pot, covering them. Feature 4 was found in the northeast corner of the room and covered with a bro- ken storage jar and a number of disarticulated bones. These included the metarcarpals, metarsub and phalanges of a small child mixed with an assortment of animal bones. The associ- ated objects included miniature vessels (fig. 6). Also found nearby were a scaled down haematite macehead and a stone stamp seal.109 Feature 16 was found in the southeast corner, and under a shoulder of a storage vessel. This was a composite of two or three individuals (infants) that appeared to be re-articulated in a secondary burial. While the skull of a sheep was found, no human crania were located. In the northwest corner a further burial (Feature 18) was located under a jar sherd. This con- tained an infant cranium under which lay a number of other disarticulated human and animal bones. 108.

( Photograph courtesy of the University of Sydney's Teleilat Ghassul Project.) While it may appear that there is an unusual concentration of burials in this area, in fact infant or neonate burials are com- mon across the site and have been found in clusters elsewhere (figs. 4-5). However, the association of the miniature vessels and objects with this area is noteworthy. What are these min- iature vessels and what can we make of their association with infant burials? Although some of the first studies of children within mate- rial culture developed from studies of toys,110 it is argued that toys "have powerful associations in our culture with amuse- ment and small size."111 Interpreting scaled down objects as children's toys has been criticised by feminist archaeology as a "diminutive" view of the child.112 A concentration on toys, it is argued, serves to divorce the activities of children, from the more serious and worthy world of the adult.113 While it is important not to overlay modern norms on chil- dren in Prehistory,114 studies of child behaviour do suggest that interaction with objects is an innate part of any child's self- driven learning processes and that this is general across cul- tures. Children borrow their play relations from the systems of interaction they are familiar with (i.e., mother-child, father- child, child-child, etc.) and then use them to work out their own relationships and engineer new relationships for themselves.115 It is therefore highly likely that children in the past played with toys, or used objects "from the adult world" as part of their play. It is also likely that in some cases these would be scaled down versions of real objects. Miniature vessels are actually reasonably common in the Chalcolithic. They occur at a variety of sites (e.g., Abu Hamid) and in other areas at Teleilat Ghassul (table 6). Other minia- ture vessels from Teleilat Ghassul come from domestic struc- tures, and the majority come from the final occupation at the site, e.g. Area H features a large long-room building which has revealed a small churn fragment and a miniature jar.116 Addi- tional miniatures include a small churn derived from occupa- tion associated with rectilinear architecture of Phase E. This is part of a courtyard associated with a domestic building exca- vated by Hennessy with the famous "spook mask" wall paint- ing (fig. 5). A small V-shaped bowl, or even stand comes from Sondage AX, Phase C. The level from which the miniature comes cannot be associated with any architecture.117 A similar bowl (which is probably a stand) comes from N1 3.13. A number of small sized vessels, including a cornet, have been reported from the PBI excavations.118 Another illustrated by R. North is artefact number 8558, 119 which is drawn as a small vessel, although its diameter is not clear. It appears to be a store jar, but is apparently square and might have been part of an ossuary or some other object. I argue that these objects represent the living world of chil- dren - and that in Area Q at Teleilat Ghassul, they were both votives and toys, and that incorporation of neonate or infant 110.

LOVELL Table 6 - Ceramic miniatures from Teleilat Ghassul (after NORTH, 1961, and provided by the author). burials into domestic complexes was perhaps a way of domes- ticating the rituals surrounding the dead. I. Hodder has argued that the Neolithic house was the "location of the drama of life," which included the domestication of the wild, the domestication of the dead and the processing of food and that the presence of young dead within this arena may be part of this metaphor.120 These miniatures appear to be associated with basic domestic forms. Often they are bowls, but there are quite a number of jars. Sometimes they are more particular forms: spouted jars, cornets, but in general they represent general household items (like those in tables 1-3) and no doubt formed part of a child's way of experiencing and learning about his/her world.121 Incor- porating a child's objects with an infant or a neonate burial might have been a way of willing or elongating the life of that soul, and/or ensuring renewal. The distinction between these souls and those of other, older children and adults who were incorporated in extra-mural cemeteries is outside the scope of this paper, but has been widely commented on elsewhere.122 Of course, we can never know what these activities meant to the Chalcolithic inhabitants, we can merely speculate on the traces they left behind and the different registers of behaviour they may have represented. However, viewed in conjunction with the excavated evidence from other parts of the site, this data presents yet another social ritual, which appears to be represented in distinct clusters. These clusters recall J.C. Bar- rett's "focal points" or "framing devices" which potentially "referenced a suite of cosmological values" and which were perhaps connected by "paths," both facilitating and foreclos- ing access:123 "(•••) paths linked certain places rather than others, and the practice of movement linked those places in certain val- ue-laden sequences allowing the practitioners to rework those values into their own biographies through the movement of their own bodies. Thus practice literally relived certain basic values of place, movement and orientation (...)."124 Viewing Chalcolithic settlement holistically allows such a view and permits the background players to move into the 120. HODDER, 1990: 27-37. 121. Central to J. Piaget's original thesis is that play is imitative and reflects cognitive skills. Piaget claimed that a child's toys (and the use to which they were put) experienced the "repercussions" of everything that had happened that day to the child (PIAGET, 1962). 122. J. Sofaer Derevenski has argued that infants may not have been included in Tiszapolgar-Basatanya cemetery, Hungary because inclusion relied upon "personhood." She suggests that neonates might not have been viewed as "complete" enough (SOFAER DEREVENSKI, 1997). This view is echoed in studies of children's burials from the Southern Levant as well, but more recent discussion of children's burials has also been focused upon defining or supporting arguments concerning "rank" within the adult world (e.g., GOPHER, 1995). 123.

The domestic sphere can begin to show through the spaces between excavated "Areas" and allow us to envisage a more nuanced past. RITUAL AND THE THEATRE OF THE EVERYDAY R. Bradley notes that ritual is not always connected with religious belief, nor are all procedures as formal as they might appear. Ritual is best seen as a kind of practise, a performance which is defined by its own conventions. Its function is not only to communicate religious beliefs and it is unnecessary to separate its activity from the patterns of everyday life.125 Levy, following R.A. Rappaport,126 notes that religious and social ritual are entwined127 but in using correlates for the religious,128 he prefaces specific cultic behaviour rather than exploring this "entwined" phenomenon. The above discussion of Areas E and Q at Teleilat Ghassul demonstrates that com- munity participation in ritual activities, whether secular or cul- tic, was both widespread and broad-based. Not only do similar architectural complexes appear in other areas of the site com- plete with painted plaster, and other finds, but in Area Q exca- vated by Bourke's team, there exists a further complex with what might be interpreted as votive offerings expressing one part of everyday ritual. In other words, the trappings of ritual (whatever that may have meant) are found throughout settle- ments in various contexts that might also have been domestic in function. In this context, Area E becomes less remarkable - a domes- tic space in which particular rituals were contained. One might argue that this was an essential feature of Chalcolithic cultic ritual, i.e., it may have been important that ritual activity took place in a space that mirrored or used the "domestic sphere"129 and further, that ritual paraphernalia reflected the domestic unit or space in certain ways - house shaped ossuaries found in Chalcolithic burial caves might present another example of this.130 In almost all facets of the Ghassulian everyday, we can detect the trappings of social ritual in the painting and decorating of walls, in the conspicuous display of imagery on pots, and in the repeated styles, positions and shapes of instal- lations and other artefacts. The quotidian therefore represents an important mechanism which integrated different fields of social practise.131 While much of this has been said in relation to other parts of the world,132 there is value in revisiting the issue of com- munity and ritual in this particular context. Theoretical dis- cussions of materiality,133 cognition and symbolism,134 and agency135 to name a few, have not been fully absorbed by pre- historians of the Levant and these approaches do offer new avenues for further research. Some exciting new strands are beginning to emerge. Although it is impossible to accurately interpret the mean- ing of symbols in the past, Goren has recently proposed that a different set of imagery associated with the ibex can be linked with another community in the same Dead Sea Region, pro- ducing the elaborate, lost wax metal work known from the Judean desert, circulating around En Gedi.136 It is tempting to suggest that cornets and images of ibex at Teleilat Ghas- sul137 were linked to this, particular community. At the very least, images of ibex recall a desert landscape at a short dis- tance from Teleilat Ghassul, which was crossed and linked by particular movements of people and animals. At Hujayrat al- Ghuzlan the ibex appears on wall decorations,138 as it does in the wider region of Aqaba139 and, indeed, in other protohistoric desert sites like Wisad Pools.140 The appearance of this imag- ery at Quleh141 has prompted similar suggestions. The next challenge will be tracing these communities across landscapes, up lateral wadis, down the coastal plain, etc., to see how and to what degree they integrated and inter- acted with one another. Studies of mortuary data already sug- gest important new research directions,142 but there is more to be done in tracing community cohesion and inter-regional interaction across Jordan, Palestine and Israel - and, of course, further afield. V. Roux and M.-A. Courty's study of technological com- munities143 presents another cross-cutting community. More detailed studies of house floors across broad exposures will 125. Bradley, 2005. 126.

LOVELL begin to reveal the nature of the communities that actually inhabited Chalcolithic sites and the other communities which came into contact with them, and perhaps, the communities which were imagined, shifting or created. Social ritual forms the behaviour where those community relations are played out, where the stories are told and re-told. When we observe these rituals we are observing the artefactual remains of communi- ties and their stories. CONCLUSIONS All the various parts of the Chalcolithic puzzle are linked via communities. Studying the domestic sphere is the way to link all of these parts in order to pursue the different regis- ters in the archaeological record, i.e., "different fields of social practise." This is then the "place" where imagined and classic communities of the Chalcoltihic intersect. I have attempted to show here that we have ignored important aspects of social ritual (e.g., infant burials) in favour of cult with a capital C. But community is cult and cult is community, and it is in unpick- ing the strands of the narrative that is the most challenging and potentially valuable aspect of our work as "interpretative" archaeologists and: "We must now find ways to allow human agency to bear its role in the creation of history, a challenge which will change the object of archaeological study."144 Ritual was practised in homes and courtyards, in fields and wadis and formed an expression of the values and beliefs that bound or divided Chalcolithic communities. It is these com- munities that should be brought back into the foreground in order to present more nuanced representations of social inter- action in the Chalcolithic. Chiefs and priests are all very well, but their flashy robes have quite possibly obscured the living reality of the past. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This is the published version of a paper I was invited to give at a workshop at New Orleans (ASOR 2009) run by M. Chesson and oth- ers, as such it benefitted from feedback received from various partici- pants there. I presented and developed this research in a seminar at the Centre for Classical and Near Eastern Studies of Australia (CCA- NESA) when I was a Visiting Scholar and Honorary Associate of the University of Sydney. I thank the staff of CCANESA and J. Fraser for convening the seminar. I thank S.J. Bourke for insightful comments and for permission to discuss the Teleilat Ghassul material here. This paper owes much to my training in French, which introduced me to structuralism and, in turn, both to post-structuralism and to G. Doll- fus. So many of my better thoughts about Teleilat Ghassul have been informed and shaped by the discussions I had with Geneviève while working with her and Z. Kafafi on the Abu Hamid material in the 1990s. Her keen eye for stratigraphy, her tendency toward caution and clear argument, and her multidisciplinary approach to site stud- ies was a model to many young researchers. She has taught me a lot and I owe her far too much! Jaimie L.
