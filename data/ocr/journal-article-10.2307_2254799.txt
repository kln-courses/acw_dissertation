<plain_text><page sequence="1">Idolatry, by Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit. Translated by Naomi Goldblum. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992. Pp. 299. ?31.95. The idea of idolatry is one full of philosophical interest, involving issues of representation, identity, intention, valuation and imagination, as well as more specifically religious issues having to do with deification and worship. And philosophy itself frequently has an iconoclastic function. In this unusual and instructive study the authors explore such issues mainly from within the per- spective of Judaism, utilising both biblical and rabbinic sources, looking at idolatry from an antipagan viewpoint (p. 7). Their aim is to show that idolatry is a fluid concept because it is parasitic upon the concept of a true, worshipful God, and that as concepts of God shift within a tradition, so does what is held to constitute idolatry. The work is historically informed-the authors wear their learning with admirable lightness-without ever ceasing to be philo- sophical in character. The authors are equally at home in modem work in ana- lytic philosophy, G.E. Moore and Goodman and Kripke, as in the religious sources of their own tradition, and effectively use the one to illuminate and elucidate the other. The work is almost entirely one of elucidation; the authors do not venture to offer a critique of any of the models of idolatry that they dis- cuss. They succeed admirably in their aim to analyse a central concept of monotheism while at the same time elucidating more general philosophical issues. They separate out four main conceptions of idolatry, without claiming exhaustiveness. These conceptions function as models, as organising ideas</page><page sequence="2">420 Book Reviews with distinctive theoretical implications. Where God is regarded in both anthropomorphic and anthropopathic terms, as a husband, idolatry has been conceived of as a breach of fidelity, as adultery or whoredom, as union with "strange gods". If God is seen as a king, with exclusive rights of allegiance, then idolatry is rebellion, the investing of neighbouring kings with divine authority and as a consequence investing them with divinity. What is at issue in this conception of idolatry is not so much whether the false gods are real, but whether they are worshipful; monolatry rather than monotheism. But why, if God manifests himself in empirical ways, is it forbidden to make representations of him? And why, if representations of God in visual form are forbidden, is it permissible (and even mandatory) to speak of God in visual terms? Why is it permissible to say that God has a hand while forbidden to paint the hand of God? One answer, presumably, is that linguistic represen- tation is conventional, that "represent" is itself a metaphor here; another is that to eliminate words about God would cause a revelational theology such as Judaism to self-destruct. The discussion of visual and verbal representation leads on to an extended discussion of the relationship between myth and idol- atry. In sharp contrast idolatry can be "internalised". It is not misplaced loyalty or affection, but an error of the mind, brought out particularly starkly by a lim- iting case, by what the authors plausibly take to be the negative theology of Maimonides, a sort of conceptual agnosticism about God. Yet it is hard to take seriously an account of idolatry which is so intellectualised, one in which alle- giance and affection play such a vanishingly small part. By a curious inversion, in Maimonides idolatry is understood as a semantic thesis, as the erroneous belief that God is positively or literally what he is said to be: for Maimonides all theological sentences are category mistakes (p. 152). Maimonides in effect extends the ban on pictorial representations of God to linguistic representations (p. 54). Idolatry is thus metaphysical error, the wor- ship of the true God while retaining a positive conception of God in the mind. This is not then participating in the idolatry of the pagans, but it is the (almost) inevitable consequence of "popular religion", for freedom from idolatry is only possible given a certain degree of metaphysical sophistication. But Mai- monides, interpreted in this way, is surely a limiting case, and it is a pity that the authors do not discuss what would appear to be a half-way house position between anthropomorphism and negative theology, the use of language about God in figurative and metaphorical ways so as to accommodate finite thought to the infinite; as, for example, in Philo. Three of the central chapters of the book are taken up with various aspects of the error view of idolatry, in particular the way in which the Enlightenment in effect pushed Maimonidean arguments against folk religion a stage further, making out that all positive statements about God involved error (p. 135). The authors here provide an excellent discussion of intentionality and representa- tion, and discuss the conditions under which two or more people may be said</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 421 to worship the same God. Are identities between gods based upon politics or metaphysics? The authors take up a suggestion of G.E. Moore's (in his "'Real' and 'Imaginary' in G.E. Moore" in his Lectures on Philosophy, ed. C. Lewy) as to the conditions to be fulfilled for two idolaters worshipping the same god, offering a thesis based upon a combination of causal conditions and similarity conditions. But their notion of an exclusive description (p. 155) seems to absorb the causal conditions into the similarity conditions. A third view is idolatry as the worship of an aspect of God where a part is taken for the whole. Unlike Maimonidean negative theology (which the authors expound brilliantly), with its heavy emphasis upon divine simplic- ity, this view stresses the organic or interrelated character of God. Here idolatry is not an error in belief but an error in intention, a misplacing of worship (p. 197). This (to me) rather obscure view nevertheless raises inter- esting questions about the nature of worship. In Christian theism, despite avowals of divine simplicity, there is the complexity of triunity, but few if any Christian theologians would think it idolatrous to concentrate worship exclusively on one trinitarian person. Does the existence of idolatry imply the intentional existence of other gods? Does idolatry imply a different world view, or a different attitude to the same world view (p. 184f)? Can the true God be worshipped idolatrously? The fourth model is idolatry as strangeness of worship, where the emphasis is on the manner of worship: the true God is truly worshipped but in an unwar- ranted manner; an emphasis not on belief but on ritual, where idolatry is externalised. In the final chapter the authors return to anthropomorphism with an interesting treatment of idolatry within a political framework. Is the recog- nition of non-authorised political authorities idolatrous? A secondary but nevertheless important thesis is introduced in Chapter Four (p. 112) in the claim that there is a connection, or at least a parallelism, to be found between the critique of idolatry by monotheism, of folk religion by what the authors refer to as the religious Enlightenment, and of religion by the secular enlightenment. As the authors note, at least some of these controversies can be paralleled in the history of Christianity. The question of what the approved way of wor- shipping the true God is bulked large at the Reformation and subsequently, in discussions about the regulative principle of worship, for example. And there have from time to time been intense controversies within Protestantism about whether mental representations (of Christ hanging on the cross, say) are inherently idolatrous. (See for example Ralph Erskine's Faith no Fancy: or A Treatise of Mental Images, (1745), which contains interesting material.) It is understandable, but a pity nonetheless, that the authors take no more than a sidelong glance at controversies about idolatry within Christendom. In the Conclusion the discussion of idolatry is brought into the modern period, in which the rhetoric of idolatry is divorced from the contrast between true and false worship. There is a brief discussion of Bacon's idols of the</page><page sequence="4">422 Book Reviews mind, Marx's theory of money-fetishism and of Wittgenstein's view of phi- losophy as iconoclastic. This is a book from which much can be learned, not only by philosophers or religion, but not least by them. At a time when much philosophy of religion is preoccupied with the question of how to be a pluralist without being an exclusivist in religion, it is salutary to be reminded (in a work of analytic phi- losophy which is almost wholly innocent of current "analytic philosophy of religion") both of the complexity of some of the issues involved, and also of the sophistication of past treatments of them. Despite the fullness of the discussion, there are some lacunae. It is not clear whether the models of idolatry are meant to be exclusive; another possible model is idolatry as folly. Exhaustive or not, the models certainly seem to be rough and ready. For example the model of idolatry as faithlessness is surely grounded in more than a relationship of allegiance. Is it not because the Lord is creator and redeemer that to worship anyone or anything else is idolatrous? And does not a more metaphysical conception of God, as "creator of the heav- ens and the earth", for example, lie behind the anthropomorphism "character- istic of biblical faith" (p. 1) to which the authors draw attention? For surely no one thought that idolatry was a literal case of adultery. And is it not because God is essentially non-material that figurative representations of him are thought to be both demeaning and distracting? But if so then all idolatry, and not merely idolatry according to the Maimonidean model, involves error in belief, the belief that some creature has a worth only enjoyed by the Creator. Idolatry is felicitously translated, and beautifully produced. Department of Theology and Religious Studies PAUL HELM King's College London Strand London WC2R 2LS UK</page></plain_text>
