<plain_text><page sequence="1">Insanity as Looking Glass Alexandra Schiissler, University of Amsterdam ABSTRACT Considering the immense popularity the Artists from Gugging, all of whom are long-term patients of a mental institute near Vienna, have achieved, the question arises of what people see in psychotics' imagery. In my essay I deal with paintings and drawings as projection screens for the spectator. I present a selection of works from Gugging and the spectators' verbal renderings of mental images that arise when contemplating these paintings and drawings. Instead as a part of the paintings and drawings I suggest viewing the screen that bears the mental images as a large and divers, but ultimately finite cultural image-repertoire, which inhabits the spectator. Referential co-ordinates for a phenomenon like insanity are hardly defined on our culture specific screens. Therefore, we are free to frame the imagery according to our desires and fears and the screen becomes a consummate surface for idiosyncratic projections. In the following article I deal with paintings and drawings as screens, a term which is generally associated with cinematic or television screens and computer monitors. These screens bear moving images, whereas paintings and drawings are static. Nevertheless, pictorial works on canvas or paper are their creators' mental images projected onto a flat support. Here, however, I am less concerned with projection in the act of painting or drawing than in the act of viewing the result. This essay focuses on verbal renderings of mental images that arise in the spectator when contemplating imagery by psychiatric patients. The habitual claim made about these mental images and their emotional impact is that they are a part of the paintings and drawings. I will argue here that the screen actually inhabits the spectator - all spectators. The screen is a large and divers, but ultimately finite cultural image-repertoire, dependant on historical and social factors which determine how members of a given culture process visual stimuli and meanings they attribute to them. We perceive the world through a screen, which influences what and how we see. I am further suggesting that imagery produced by psychiatric patients is viewed through a screen of specific referential co-ordinates and is, therefore, open to a multitude of interpretations. Insanity, the ultimate alterity, is not adequately described or understood through any of these referential co-ordinates. In the ensuing gap between the surface of projection and the understanding of it, traces of insanity may be interpreted as almost anything. The spectator is free to chose referential co-ordinates to frame the imagery ETNOFOOR, XV(l/2) 2002, pp. 131-151 131</page><page sequence="2">according to his/her desires and fears and the screen becomes a consummate surface for idiosyncratic projections. The pictorial works produced by the Artists from Gugging (Kunstler aus Gugging), all of whom are long-term patients of a mental institute near Vienna, have become accessible to a large public. Considering the immense popularity the Guggingers have achieved, the question arises of what people see in psychotics' imagery. Are paintings and drawings by creators suffering from mental disease inherently different from other pictorial works? Or is what we see in 'art' from Gugging mere projection? Things we do not understand 'Russlands Operatzijon Kommunistendoppelknaben machen aus mir aus Nazimadchen? Onepaunr.? Operation.?' August Walla wrote this sentence into one of his drawings (fig. 5). The central motive is a figure extending from top to bottom with out-stretched arms and fingers. The form of the figure's breasts and its long hair distinguish it as clearly female. Two large, half-opened pairs of scissors threaten to cut off her breasts and across the figure's belly the artist has written 'Augustine Aloisia = Georgine Walla.?' Is this her name? Why the full stop followed by the question mark? Is this a statement that is directly questioned? In blue letters Walla has written the word Zwieter.? Zwitter is the German word for hermaphrodite. Is this figure male and female at the same time? Why is there a grey hammer and sickle symbol and a star at the left side of the drawing? And what are the seven objects at the right side? Do the three orange forms merge in a Mickey Mouse head? Or is the thing with the trunk a gas mask? And the striped objects - are they receptacles needed for the operation that Walla announces in the headline? The little dark one could be a moustache and the orange, kidney-shaped receptacle could also be a short hair wig. The meaning of the hammer and sickle emblems on the red and white striped round shapes is also obscure. The Austrian flag is red and white and a red disc with a white stripe through the centre is a traffic sign that signifies 'entry prohibited'. But what does this mean? What is the artist trying to say? Using crayons and felt pens Walla has quite emphatically covered the entire sheet but the content of this drawing is far from evident. Indeed, while the work looks like a child's drawing, the depicted subjects belong to the adult world: politics, sex, gender, violence. When asked what the drawing is supposed to represent, the author, whose full name is August Alois Georg Walla, explains that he is the figure in his drawing. It is August Alois Georg Walla as woman. Is he the Nazimadchen? And what about the Kommunistendoppelknahe in this Russian operation? Walla provides us with no more coherent information. He answers questions about the subjects of his works in an enumerative and descriptive way. When asked for his motives for using specific elements in his imagery, he consistently answers, T have put it there just like that'. The same goes for one of his older drawings: twenty-eight pinkish teardrop forms and two round ones reminiscent of pieces of pork (fig. 6). Walla has marked each with a 132</page><page sequence="3">swastika. In the right corner on the top of the drawing, two immense hooks are placed above a large knife. A text within a grey area written with a ballpoint pen informs the viewer that the pink forms on the grass-green background are maternal breasts, which have been surgically removed and are for sale at the butcher's. There are two more teardrop forms in the grey section of this drawing. Like all the pink forms they are also marked with a violet swastika. Walla has used the same crayon to draw a five-point star, a hammer and sickle symbol and a sign which looks like an 'H' with the left upper portion curled into a spiral. Orange dots shine through the grey layer and the written words. Unfortunately, August Walla was neither willing to nor capable of explaining this enigmatic work. Arnold Schmidt, another artist-patient at Gugging, has created numerous works depicting the same subject over again: round toy-like figures in flashy colours. It is far from evident what they represent. Typically his figures are creations consisting of a few dynamic circular lines in vivid colours. Schmidt paints the heads with two or three circular brush strokes. The faces have round eyes and noses and a short line indicates the mouth. Usually the heads are the same size or even larger than the torsos. Legs and arms are missing or represented by another smaller circle, while the ears, hands and feet are even tinier circles. When asked what his works are supposed to depict Schmidt's short answer is: Mandeln (little male figures). These are always shown from a frontal perspective and there are either three figures or one central figure in his work. Mandeln are the only elements Schmidt puts on paper or canvas, afloat on the white surface of the support. Three figures Schmidt refers to as Menschen (people). Their arms, legs, hands and feet are circles because they are boxing, as Schmidt explains: They are hitting each other'. In another work, the same features that char acterise the extremities appear in a depic tion of a Mandel working out with gym nastic rings. The red eyes are the result of being punched in a karate fight', says Schmidt, 'this is why their eyes are drip ping' . For almost a decade Arnold Schmidt produced nothing but these circular figures, which became increasingly routine. Finally in autumn 1999 he abandoned his obsessive Fig. 1. Arnold Schmidt, Flugzeug (aeroplane) Fig.y. Arnold Schmidt, Haus (liouse) repetition and painted an aircraft for the first time, dominated by horizontal lines rather than round forms. Some time later Schmidt began painting houses. In these paintings Schmidt's compulsion (or is it just routine?) to paint circular forms reappears in the light, circular brush strokes used for the windows of the houses, other wise composed of several straight lines. 133</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3. Johann Garber, Innenansicht einer barocken Kirche (church interior) 134</page><page sequence="5">Johann Garber's drawings are characterised by a horror vacui. Like August Walla he leaves no space unmarked. Garber's works are distinguished by words of explanation and tiny arrows pointing at the subject that he wants emphasised through an abundance of minutely drawn elements. For example, when he copies a photograph of the interior of a baroque church he directs the viewer's attention to the holy fire (HI. Feuer) burning on the crucifix. Garber uses photographs for inspiration and then adds elements to his own drawing whose purpose or meaning remains unclear: the word Kino, stars, apples with two leaves, a moon, a couple of suns, a nude backside, a crocodile, which Garber tells us is holy (HI. Krokodil) as well as a penis and a vagina in the right top corner of the drawing. We know this because the creator of the work has written HI Kinderspatz von Engelnt next to the erect penis ('HI.' is a common abbreviation for Heilig (holy) and Spatz has a double meaning in Austrian German, namely 'sparrow' and 'penis'). Next to a rhombus covered with points and lines representing the female genitalia the viewer reads Von Engeln Hi Kinder und Frauenscheide. Garber imagines angels with 'holy children penises' or 'holy children and women vaginas'. While he sexualises he also sanctifies. In the middle of the overabundant ornaments, the artist has inscribed his self-portrait: Hans im Gliick (Lucky Hans). Hans is a short form of Johann, hence Garber's reference to himself, and a figure in a popular children's story by the brothers Grimm. In the story, Hans suddenly acquires wealth, and this wealth becomes a burden until he loses it and finds happiness again. In an interview conducted in September 1982, Johann Garber made the following comments about this drawing: Well, yes, here I just drew a kind of church painting. It is more of an image to look at. In order to stimulate fantasy and to be astonished about the things in the drawing. Round circles and a head of an animal or a prince from a fairytale, some kind of beautiful face that looks like a king or like a Caesar or like a god or like a devil or like an angel. I do this with lines and strokes.1 Many of Garber's richly ornamented drawings are copies of reproductions of ancient or modern art, or religious art. Over the years he has drawn a large number of cities and landscapes inspired by postcards. Nevertheless, he also produces work without models. His countless Sexi Blatter (Sexy Sheets) are drawings of male and female genitals with their verbal equivalents written next to them, or back sides of children with the explanatory words Kin der Popo and the date at the bottom of the draw ing. Sometimes the anonymous children - Garber never draws their faces - are depicted in the act of urinating. When asked about the source of his inspiration, Garber replies that his ideas come running from the back and from the front, from everywhere inside his head. According to Garber g.sex,. 6MTT.s^?r^^0^?;:r:.?J oooooooooooooooooooooooo*? Fig. 4. Johann Garber, Sexiblatt (Sexy sheets) 135</page><page sequence="6">fantasy is part of the head or the fantasy cave inside the head. Neither this answer nor anything else Garber says about his oeuvre provides clear answers as to how the drawings should be understood. The question of whether the drawings are to be seen as documents of a pathological paedophilic fantasy, as the innocent scribbling of a simple-minded person or as clairvoyant humorous sketches of prudish, catholic Austrian society, remains ambiguous. The artists from Gugging As Artists from Gugging, Schmidt (1959) and Garber (1947) are inhabitants of the Artist's House, as was Walla (1936) prior to his death in 2001. Until recently, this building was housed in a special department of the hospital for neurology and psychiatry in Maria Gugging, a small village near Vienna. About twelve long-term patients with no prospects for recovery share the colourfully painted house. A special artistic talent is ascribed to these chronic psychotics who are encouraged to draw, paint and write poetry. In 1981, psychiatrist Leo Navratil founded the artist colony on the grounds of the mental hospital. During the fifties he started to experiment with drawings as diagnostic devices. While Navratil was initially convinced that the images produced by his patients were a means of reading their mental diseases, he soon began to believe that he had discovered a genuinely artistic dimension in the patients' pictorial and verbal creations. Navratil then decided to support patients who, in his view, were talented by helping them to develop their creative capacities. He rescued a group of patients from the hopelessly overcrowded and sordid section for men and removed them to the more pleasant surroundings of the Artists' House. In order to join the fortunate few, patients had to create what is known as art brut. Jean Dubuffet coined this term in 1947 to describe art produced by creative individuals outside the art world, who are completely untainted by cultural and other artistic influence. Although the Artists' House in Gugging enjoys the reputation of a model project for psychiatric reforms, which use art therapy and attempt to reintegrate patients into society, therapy was never a priority, neither for Navratil nor for his disciple and successor Johann Feilacher. This misunderstanding arose because art therapists and medical professionals in favour of art therapy uphold the Gugging project as example for other mental institutions, largely because of its success and popularity. While this is the case, some specialists disapprove of treating psychotics through drawing and painting, as these are solitary pro cesses. In their view it is better to keep patients who suffer from schizophrenic psychosis in controlled social and labour situations. Whatever the case may be, the Artists from Gugging have no prospects of leading a normal life as they have no hope of ever leaving the mental institute. There can be no question of practical reintegration into societal structures, a goal to which most initiatives that practice creative stimulation with psychiatric patients aspire. Navratil and Feilacher rather envision the social reintegration of their patients through acknowledgement of their artistic performances. The founder of the Gugging project 136</page><page sequence="7">strove for artistic prestige and symbolic recognition for his patients, whereas Feilacher wants clients to pay top prices for the Guggingers' work. And while Navratil persisted in framing the Guggingers within a psychiatric discourse, Feilacher now promotes them exclusively as contemporary artists. He himself is not only a psychiatrist but also an artist, and so he presents Schmidt, Garber and their fellow inmates as his friends and colleagues. The versatile doctor has established a posh sales gallery next to the Artists' House and is making great strides towards staking out a niche for himself and the artist-patients within the international art world. The Guggingers are represented in major museums and important galleries trade their work. It is not surprising then, that throngs of visitors come to see the Artists' House and Gallery, where they are presented with 'insanity' as a colourful, engaging form of art. It can be consumed on guided tours through the Artists' House, as well as in the form of artworks, books, postcards, posters and calendars. Through intensively deploying practices that belong to the marketing strategies of the contemporary art machinery, Feilacher has managed to entirely distance the powerful medical discourse that had a strong grip on his former patients. Now Feilacher and his team try hard to convince the public to frame Gugging imagery as art and they do not hesitate to expose the Artists from Gugging to the art world, which can be pretty tough as any professional artist knows. Visitors in Gugging - tourists and art collectors Everyday, throngs of visitors come to the Artists' House and Gallery. Driven by a desire to see everything, many of them sign up for the guided tour through the Artists' House. A smart young woman, Johann Feilacher's assistant and gallery manager, leads groups of up to thirty people through the building. The visitors get to see the artist patients' common room, where they have their meals and where some of them do their drawings. The gallery manager introduces the patients at work to the curious visitors and she never fails to praise their artistic capacities. Through the corridor, decorated with countless exhibition posters, she leads the group to the most impressive bedrooms of the artist-patients that retain only the faintest traces of the hospital atmosphere. The patients whose private sphere is invaded by the flocks of uninvited strangers suddenly standing at their bedsides know what comes next and play along, putting on the same little act for every group of visitors. The 'madness tourists' then descend to the basement to view an enormous oven, painted by one of the inhabitants of the house in gay colours. After a visit to the garden, where more painted objects are to be admired along with the impressive facade of the house, the sightseeing ends as tourists snap photos. Visitors are also permitted to offer cigarettes to some of the Artists from Gugging and, depending on the artists' disposition, they may engage in short conversational exchanges. Finally, the group is guided back to the sales gallery where people may purchase original works of art or posters, calendars and postcards designed to suite the more restricted budget. Some visitors skip the tour and come only to visit the gallery, among them a large percentage of gallery owners and collectors. The less important clients choose from 137</page><page sequence="8">works on display and are offered mostly second choice of very recent work. The older, more desirable, and therefore, more precious works are kept in separate rooms. Feilacher decides to which collectors or dealers his assistant makes the important pieces available for purchase. With prominent dealers or influential people, the head of the Artists' House and Gallery makes the negotiations personally. In order to cultivate his relationship with these prominent dealers and to celebrate successful transactions, Feilacher takes his clients to the Artists' House for coffee. This is an occasion for gallery owners and collectors to get to know some of the inhabitants and to discuss future exhibition projects with the head of the artists' colony. What attracts hundreds of visitors to the Artists' House? What so intrigues visitors that they are willing to travel all the way to Maria Gugging in the middle of nowhere, cross the grounds of a mental hospital and climb a remote hill in order to reach the colourful building? The manager of the Artists' Gallery answers this question with one short reply: 'Because it's art'. But as I was told by a guard at an exhibition in Klosterneuburg, where Gugging works from a private collection were on display, it is also because this is not the 'usual' kind of art. Well, I am going to tell you something. Now that the Gugging artists' exhibit is here I have not once heard the same kinds of comments that I hear from visitors to modem art exhibits. Often people exclaim: T could paint this just as well!' Or: 'That is bullshit!' Strangely enough I have never heard this about the Artists from Gugging. Not once! Nobody has ever said that he or she could paint or draw just as well. Why people avoid saying so, I do not know. When other modem art is exhibited - in my mind it is not much different from what we see here (he refers to the Gugging exhibition) - people frequently feel sorry for me. They say: 'For Christ's sake! How can you stand it? What a horrifying idea to have to look at that the whole day long.' They would never say such things about the Guggingers. I couldn't tell you why. I don't know, maybe people take into account that the Guggingers are mentally a little bit sicker, well, sick - I really wouldn't know. For the visitors, art from Gugging has a special status within contemporary art. According to the guard it is much more popular than any other modern art. Ferdinand Altnoder, a gallery owner in Salzburg who specialises in twentieth-century Austrian art beginning with Alfred Kubin and Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando, confirms this opinion. He complains about the lack of interest in contemporary art: Nobody buys anything. I have tried to give young artists a chance. For example, I presented works from a young potter - very cheap. I have tried to show established artists like Oberhuber or Moosbrucker, two of the best painters. Nobody wanted a painting! All the exhibitions were like this. It was gruesome. I can afford to do all that because of Gugging. It's wonderful. In August 1999, when I interviewed Altnoder, his gallery was hosting an exhibit entitled Kunst aus Gugging. It ran from July 23 to September 11, at the same time as the Salzburg Summer Festival, when people flock to the city with budgets great and small, eager to consume culture. The gallery owner, whom I had often seen at the Artists' Gallery, explained that he was able to recuperate a deficit of more than 30.000 Euro with the money he made from the Gugging show. The deficit was incurred from the unsuccessful 138</page><page sequence="9">exhibits in his gallery earlier that year so that selling art from Gugging financed Altnoder's exhibition programme of young, commercially less interesting artists. In an attempt to explain the Guggingers' success, Altnoder stated the following: The most important thing is that people like it and find the works fascinating. Many people who come to my gallery know about Gugging. All of them have seen a documentary about the Artists' House on tv, or have read something about it. Many, many people know about Gugging and are delighted to finally see the work in real life. Some are so overwhelmed by the force of the images that they become collectors. How we explain things we do not understand Medical research has not yet been successful in finding a remedy for mental disorders like schizophrenic psychosis, nor has it been able to explain their genesis. Insanity remains an unknown and inaccessible terrain. As specialists and the staff of mental institutes confronted with mental disorders on a daily basis, or researchers on the enigma of psychosis are clueless about the actual nature of insanity, it is no wonder that the majority of people, who have hardly ever been in touch with psychiatric patients, fill the lack of knowledge about the mental condition known as madness with fantasies. The victims of insanity are mute, at least as far as logo-centric society is concerned. The voice of madness, expressed in symptoms like catatonia, grimace, epileptic fits, has been silenced with neuroleptics. Psychopaths' means of expression have been wiped out except some poor remnants, which survive within the controlled boundaries of art, ergo or music therapy. The remaining creative energy is channelled into producing imagery, handicrafts and noise. Only a small percentage of these pictorial works are framed as art, and this framing is consistently rooted in the idea that genius is inherent in folly. This is a tradition that reaches back to Genio e folia, published by Cesare Lombroso in 1867. Creators of imagery, who have been diagnosed as mentally ill, supposedly produce paintings and drawings but do not control or influence how their works are categorised or evaluated. Psychiatrists have invited artists and art historians to judge their patients' pictorial products. Art theoretical discourses, which praise the works as grand oeuvres without analysis or criticism, have claimed the patients' works. There is a market and even a magazine for outsider art or art brut, the current terms for paintings and drawings from mental institutes. Psychiatry has lost its interest in the imagery produced by creators who are purportedly mentally disordered and, within the multifaceted art world, there are differing opinions as to whether or not any doodling that originates in a mental hospital constitutes art. The variance of opinion allows for many different interpretations of patients' pictorial works. Moreover, because the creators are mad and cannot explain their intentions, nobody can be sure what they 'mean' with their works. This creates a gap in the generation of meaning, a gap normally filled by referring to the author. And since the publication of any information concerning the creators is considered unethical from a medical point of view, such biographical details rarely leave the mental hospital. 139</page><page sequence="10">Literature on works from Gugging is relatively scarce. Leo Navratil, the founder of the Artists' House, wrote the majority of articles and books on the topic, which are based on an approach from within the discipline of psychiatry. The latest catalogues of Gugging exhibitions (e.g. Sonneastro or Carom.!) are poor in their informational and reflective contents. This may be seen as part of the dominant trend in modernism 'to wrench outsider art loose from any context - cultural, social, or psychological - in terms of which it might have been possible to situate it, and declared it "free", so that it could be used, like "primitive art", for its own currency' (Maclagan in Hiller 1991:46). Viewers' interest in works from mental hospitals vary greatly and viewers feel free to attribute their own meaning to what they have been privileged to see. In my field work, I asked visitors at the Artists' Gallery to interpret the imagery that they had come to the Gallery to contemplate. I invited collectors to talk about their collections. All other informants were asked to select imagery they felt interpolated by from a pile of A4 colour copies, in which there were several different works by each of the Guggingers. Often the viewer began his or her ekphrasis ('translation' from pictorial into verbal language) by describing the drawing or painting in question. An enumeration of the elements, which have caught the viewer's eye, makes his/her conscious perception quite clear. Nevertheless, most of my interlocutors found it difficult to put their attraction to certain imagery into words. A thirty-year old female PhD student in political science Fig. 5. August Walla, Russlands Operatzijon (Rusland's Operation) selected three works by Walla. She ex plained that she finds the contradictory elements brought together by the artist patient 'funny'. Looking at Walla's Russ lands Operatzijon she comments: On one hand we have got a hammer and sickle in connection with - oh, I haven't even read the text in the drawing yet - commu nism. Hmm, aggressiveness. The scissors, they want to somehow cut off breasts. Well, straight away Nazis come to my mind, the mutilation. What have we got here? Her maphrodite. Well, he's had an operation, a change of gender in connection to a political system or aggressiveness against genitals in connection with the system. It has a very negative emanation, whereas the colours are somehow ... it's almost somehow cheerful. Pink, orange, light, but then again the scis sors, they dominate the image and give me a creepy feeling. Once she had taken the time to read all of the text in the drawing, the viewer tried to verbalise what sense she would make of the image: 140</page><page sequence="11">Aah, yes, when I read the words ... I think I understand. Well, straight ideas and strict rules about the way women have to function and about the way men have to function. In communism this was less pronounced. Hmm, I really cannot see the strict separation into gender roles in communism, but aggressiveness, National Socialism and gender form a unit in my mind. The hammer and sickle connected to the Austrian anthem - maybe he means the fear of communism in Austria. It has less to do with the KPO (Austrian Communist Party), but more with the anxiety from communism which deep down still exists. First the country was Nazi and then they were terrified to death of communism - and this is somehow connected to gender and aggressiveness. Another female observer was convinced that she was viewing an abortion scene. The words aus mir aus Nazimadchen (from me from Nazi girl) caused her to think that someone intended to cut a child out of the figure's belly. Her association of war with rape motivated this idea. The drawing represents an undesired child in her view. A twenty-eight year old woman, training to become a psychiatrist, commenting on Walla's Russland Operatzijon explained that, 'Walla feels castrated. It is a historical trauma - the Second World War. Something has happened to Austrians, probably. World War II certainly had no positive effects on Austrian self-esteem'. A forty-year old teacher of history and psychology selected Walla's drawing of severed maternal breasts. He explained that he likes this particular drawing because it seems uncannily aggressive. In a rather helpless manner he reported having had similar fantasies as a little boy. Another spectator identified thighs in the same drawing. The first thought that came to his mind was bags; bags full of money, a Nazi treasure at the bottom of a lake. The grass-green background then led him to abandon his theory, as he asked himself: What is that? Fig. 6. August Walla, Mutterbriiste (Mother breast) Another young woman conceives of Walla's drawing of amputated maternal breasts as the logical consequence of Russtand Operatzijon. Thinking out loud, she explained that, 'after the operation you can buy the leftovers in a sack. But then again it looks like pork legs. Whereas at the same time it reminds me of graves in a graveyard. It is because of the green and the positioning, like rows of crosses in a graveyard'. Another woman also chose this drawing and later asked if she could change her mind, as she had not realised the subject of the drawing. Most importantly for her, she had missed all the swastikas at first glance. While she liked the beautiful colours, she thought of the work as too political and too radical for her taste. A twenty-five year old graphic designer who lives in Klosterneuburg, Walla's birthplace, reacted to the swastikas in following way: 141</page><page sequence="12">If I ask myself why accept this from him [Walla], I conclude that there are three reasons. First he is traded as artist, secondly he is crazy and third he is accepted and successful. Well, I mean, his closest environment, the people living in the town of Klosterneuburg, don't accept him. They have literally made him leave. He grew up here. He nearly perished out there in the deserted and destroyed military base, where they made him and his mother move. And finally they succeeded in sequestering him in Gugging, out there with the madmen. But now he is accepted, not by them, but worldwide. He is the richest and everything. This is why he is allowed to handle hot symbols like the swastika. A man in his late thirties whom I met at the Artists' Gallery when he was visiting with some friends told me about Walla: What fascinates me are the many political and sexual symbols he uses in his drawings, which keep returning. Sexuality is a central theme in his imagery. For me - without knowing anything about Walla - this means that, as I suspect, he must have had some nasty experiences. The Russians come up repeatedly. I would guess he probably got abused. And if I interpret his political texts I conclude that in his early years he must have already been a critical mind (Querdenker). This man's girl-friend added: T couldn't hang these images in our living room next to my chair where I would have to look at them all the time. Somehow it touches me too deeply'. Fig. 7. Arnold Schmidt, figur (single figure) A lady at the gallery remained in front of a drawing by Arnold Schmidt for a long time. When asked what fascinated her about this work she replied that it was the colours and the round forms, which appeared to be an integrated unit to her. 'It's somehow - it's round', she explained, 'and it's friendly'. When shown a Schmidt painting with three figures she said, 'it's almost the same - the round forms, but different colours. They are aggressive. One of them is sad, the other one is astonished and the third one is evil. One is dominant and this one is suppressed and the third one is trying to resist, but he has no chance'. An airline attendant whose partner had grown up in Kierling, the neighbour vil lage of Maria Gugging, was very fond of Schmidt's Mandeln. She began her inter pretation carefully with some formal and technical observations and then went on to attribute meaning to the painting: I think it supposedly represents a family. At least I see a family. It is relatively strange, this one figure is the only one with brown hair - at least it looks like that. And then these people are black and inside blood red, as if something were burning inside them. Two of them hold something in 142</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 8. Arnold Schmidt, drei figuren (three figures) their hands and this one, this person or this woman has nothing. And that one even has red eyes. It is somehow - it comes across as father, mother and child. The child seems most satanic. I mean in the sense that it is somehow broken. People have destroyed it. He has got red eyes. I think it is some family story. When I asked about the emotional implications of the painting the woman replied: Well, I think it has been painted in a phase - well, I imagine - when the painter was unable to grasp the pain yet. The expression is relatively neutral. It is just three figures and the smallest of them is the most red. His condition is the worst or something. The figure with hair is the tallest - probably the father. And then there is the mother and the child. Well, it seems like the artist has painted it in a rather neutral mood. Probably he understands that 'okay, something went wrong in my family and I am the one to suffer from it'. I think the red-eyed figure is the painter himself. The artist perceives himself, but he does not express pain or anything else, it is purely symbolic. No pain, no mourning, no gayness - not in these colours ... the painting looks like it was made in an outburst of anger. The aggression is not destructive, but it had to be released on paper. You can see that in the signature - he could cover the whole surface with his scribbling. When I asked if she knew the painter, she told me that she had seen him during her last visit to the Artists' House. 'He was relatively inaccessible that day', she reported. 'He kept standing at the window. Yes, I really think that he had to go through troubled times with his family. The painting represents it'. A male spectator attributed a completely different meaning to the same painting. He first saw air-balloons and then blown-up people. He stated: 143</page><page sequence="14">They are not antipathetic, but come across as terribly hollow. They have some kind of relation with each other - in any case they are not strangers. The one with the red eyes - very difficult to interpret. Maybe he is scared. They seem to be proud and somehow very self-assured. They act as if they were very important. I don't think that they are dangerous. They do not come across as threatening - but it could be. They need to turn against something. The red eyes. Very difficult to say. Maybe insecurity. He is not very self-confident. A female collector, whose living room is dominated by huge Arnold Schmidt paintings, said of her collection: If I were really honest and told you what this art has got to do with me I would have to say that it functions like a mirror. Every day it reflects to me anew that I am standing on the other side for the moment. Every day it reassures me that I am doing well and that I manage to get around in this world. Fig. 9. Johann Garber, Am Tag eines Bauers (On a Farmer's Day) Looking at Johann Garber's Am Tag eines Bauers (On a Farmer's Day) a photographer, who also teaches photography in an evening course, was fascinated with the words he found in the drawing: Habakuk. This dates from when? - 1984. Phew, he is already dead. Habakuk is dead. Do you know Habakuk? He used to be a clown on tv. It was terrible. He was terrible. I hated him as a child. More importantly, there was a program for children named 'Tobi and Tobias'. These two were puppets. It was terrifying. It was horrible. One of them was a monkey and they always talked like this (he imitates a shrill voice). This Habakuk was gruesome. Bundesheer (the federal armed 144</page><page sequence="15">forces) is also gruesome. He has written down a list of things that are gruesome. Kronenzeitung (a cheap tabloid), Habakuk, Bundesheer, Schiefiplatz (shooting range), St. Johann. Tyrol I really hate! There is Arlberg and Tyrol - I don't really like people from Vorarlberg (the most western Austrian province) or from Tyrol. And somewhere I have seen Schweiz (Switzerland) in this drawing. I don't like it - everything that's too mountainous. Where is Schweiz? Well, look here we have it. Dachstein (a famous peak), Austria. Super. Why did he put this here? I have no idea. Aha. Aha. It is great. That's Tyrol or something. A lot is happening in the Alps and the horrifying countries, which he also hates. Switzerland, Alps, Salzburg (not actually in the drawing), St. Johann, Tyrol. When I asked what is happening in the Alps, he answered, 'Gruesome. Look! They are burning people and god knows what'. When I expressed disbelief he tried to convince me by pointing out figures in the drawing. 'For sure, look there, they're even laughing while they're doing it'. I objected saying that the farmers might be burning trash. 'Yea, maybe they are trash farmers', he insisted, 'but with these weird horns on their heads they're really suspicious. It is a fierce scene in the Alps'. Then he turned to Garber's Wald (Woods) and asked: 'Oslo - Oslo is marked in this drawing. Would you happen to know why'? I told him that this drawing was inspired by a painting by Eduard Munch that Garber's psychiatrist, Leo Navratil, had asked him to copy. The viewer replied, 'I prefer the other drawing (Am Tag eines Bauers). You want to know why? Because of Tyrol and stuff. It's pretty annoying. But who can get annoyed about Norway? Probably only Norwegians. Fig. 10. Johann Garber, Wald (Woods) 145</page><page sequence="16">Another female observer who also looked at both drawings commented: Everything is synchronous and everything is in everything in here. Nothing is directly delimited; it is entire and whole. This one (Wald) I would describe as jungle and that one (Am Tag eines Bauers) as civilisation, because - well, you can see it yourself. That one is straighter and more organised. It represents a city with aeroplanes and an army. This is somehow the world now (Am Tag eines Bauers) and that one (Wald) is the world before. Here we even have laughing faces and the sun. The jungle has been painted earlier. I suppose he (Garber) painted it first. The process of painting enabled him to bring order into his chaos, although it is still a mess. Anyway, compared to the earlier one - within two years he has made a lot of progress. Another male spectator chose the Wald drawing, because at first sight it reminded him of a Tibetan Tanka with many elements: It is the circulation - it is about nature, people, countries. It is by far too confusing to contain a specific message. It is one of the images that I am unable to explain why I picked it. Somehow it's a forest. There are animals. Well, jungle book - stories happen in the woods. It's a jungle book representation. One woman, who had herself spent time in the mental institute after attempted suicide, commented on the same drawing: It's fascinating in its accurateness. I would never have the patience to be so precise. One has to take time in order to observe it. There are so many birds and people and who knows what else drawn on the trunks. It is fantastic how precise he is - and nothing is double. Not one trunk looks like another, they are all different. It is very exotic. Image - projection Visitors to the Artists' House and collectors were asked to talk about paintings and drawings that interpolate them (sie ansprechen), or in some way effect or touch them. Roland Barthes distinguishes what he calls the studium from the punctum in terms of the impact that a photographic image has on the viewer. The studium is what is interesting or fascinating in a picture. It is perceived in the context of specific knowledge, within a specific culture. It refers to conventional information. This experience is dominated by an average affect, a kind of emotional conditioning. In a shared culture each depicted situation elicits specified sentiments: we feel what we have been taught to feel. This visual experience follows Gombrich's formula: What you see is what you know. Always looking through a screen with referential co-ordinates specific to our culture, time and social situation, we know exactly which of these co-ordinates frame the visual phenomenon we are looking at. The studium is perfectly coded. To be able to use the code at ease gives rise to a certain pleasure. We therefore like images - and there are many of them - which engage our interest through the familiar studium. Nevertheless, certain images - sometimes rather unspectacular ones - bear 'something' that suddenly jumps out from its context and pierces the viewer. We do not 'like' these images, since 'liking' would be too weak a term. We are rather arrested by them. A 146</page><page sequence="17">peculiar sense of being exposed, of being gazed at or even of being wounded, results from the experience. The informed gaze is fantasised into existence on the basis of the viewer's apprehension of his/her emplacement in the field of vision. The spectator conceives of him/herself as 'being seen', as turning into an image, as 'other'. This experience within the visual field is what Barthes refers to as the punctum. Images with a punctum are disquieting and touch us deeply, leaving us unable to name exactly what produced the feeling of uncomfortable arousal. Our attempts to verbalise the cause of this experience end in speeches that encircle rather than capture its source. Hence, the gaze manifests itself less through its source than through its effects. In his book Camera Lucida Barthes tries to give examples for puncti in a wide range of photographic images. Halfway through he concludes that, if it is possible to name the punctum, it is certainly not that element which affects the viewer so intensively, since the punctum necessarily eludes straightforward description. The attempt to capture the punctum in words, in poetic tropes, is the equivalent of self-exposure. When the viewer attempts to describe the punctum, which is often an element of secondary importance in an image, s/he adds something to what is already there. The spectator's ekphrasis reveals more about the spectator than the image. Just like Rorschach's ink blots, anything can be read into the imagery. 'If what we read into a Rorschach ink blot reveals our innermost nature, what do we not find and disclose about ourselves in the complex and deliberately evocative symbols of art?' (Lewis Mumford 1979:215) Although not everyone would agree that imagery from Gugging is art, this imagery lends itself perfectly to the reflection of that which has been repressed or never realised in the spectator. Summarising the many different interpretations of the Guggingers' paintings and drawings makes it clear that all of the viewers who looked at these pictorial works were trying to describe what for them constitutes the punctum. In doing so, they revealed much more about themselves than about the imagery produced by the psychiatric patients. In order to explain why this is so, I shall turn to the work of George Didi-Huberman. In Ce que nous voyons, ce qui nous regarde, he distinguishes two kinds of experiences on the part of the viewer engaged in looking at an artefact. On the one hand, there is what the viewer sees of the material object - volume, form, colour and texture - which constitutes the index of the realm of manmade artefacts and art. This experience follows the old adage, 'what you see is what you see and nothing more than that'. On the other hand, there is the experience of being looked back at, or being touched by what one contemplates. As in Barthes' notion of the punctum, there is no material evidence for the impression of being gazed at or touched in the artefact. It cannot be pinned down to any physical qualities of the object, or to a possible referent. The screen through which the world is apprehended does not represent the phenomenon in question. The artefact evokes this 'thing' by association and through language games, yet the 'thing' itself is physically absent. Looking turns into the conviction that something inevitably escapes us. Looking turns into losing, into a void. The artefact, in this case the canvas with a layer of acrylic or oil paint, or paper with traces of crayons or ink, stands in for something that is not there. The spectator denies 147</page><page sequence="18">the loss and consequent emptiness induced by the symbolic. And here we need to turn to the origin, the point of introduction of the symbolic into the field of vision: the mirror stage. In his theory of the stade du miroir Jacques Lacan provided a basis for understanding the phenomenon of projection. Lacan explains how the image of the body and the image of all other objects arise at the mirror stage in infant development. When the child is between four and six months old, it realises that it can control its own mirror image (the wholeness of the body) whereas it is not yet able to control its actual body, which is still fragmented in this sense. The child perceives in other objects the image of the own body, the principle of its unity. Thus, the unity of the body image, the ideal imago, is only anticipated and perceived as part of the exterior world. Because of this double relationship to the self, all other objects in the child's environment are structured around the wandering shadow of the ego. They are all discerned as fundamentally anthropomorphic and even as egomorphic. Desire and anxiety are the driving forces for projections. During the mirror stage the subject is inscribed into the symbolic. When looking with their child into a mirror parents correlate their infant with his/her specular image. They point at the image on the reflecting surface and say: 'Look, that's you!' The symbolic is introduced into the field of vision. The central feature of the symbolic, of any language, is discontinuity. Words or any other signifiers can never fully represent us, they can never fully capture the totality of the real. There is always something missing in language. 'This is also why entering into the field of linguistic representation permits the development of our desire and a certain structuration of our identity; but this identity can never be full since the symbolic is never full' (Stavrakakis 1992:52). The illusionary unity of the body - order and control - that is perceived in the looking glass during the mirror stage is at the base of desire, whereas the infant' s actual body in pieces that belongs to the realm of the real - fragmentation and chaos - engenders anxiety. Desire, based on a lack resulting from identification with the ideal imago which is never complete and the resulting fear of incoherence, disintegration and the final disappearance (death) leads the looking subject to create a Active model - a projection - by reorganising the material volume and emptiness, the body and its disappearance. This Active model, this 'something' the artefact evokes, is created in the spectator's imagination, and through subjectivity that has passed the mirror stage and is now attached to a body. The subject projects the self or parts of the self onto objects in the outside world. Marianne Hirsch has suggested that children in Holocaust photographs are the consummate targets for projections. Only eleven percent of Jewish children in the entire Nazi-occupied territory survived the ferocity of the Nazi death machine. Images of these persecuted children recall their disappearance, an enormous loss, the intended destruction of an entire culture down to its very objects and artefacts. 'Less individualised, less marked by the particularities of identity (...) children invite multiple projections and identifications' (Hirsch 1999:13). I would suggest that children are suitable sites of projection because they belong to the category of transitional subjects, a term coined by August Ruhs who builds his 148</page><page sequence="19">theory on Winnicott's notion of the transitional object. Winnicott observed that in infant development, a specific object - usually a soft toy or a piece of textile - comes to play a fundamental role in the child's becoming a subject. A very young baby does not distinguish between the inside and outside world. At about six months, the infant begins to separate him/herself from blissful unity with the universe. Slowly it starts to exist as a subject with a structured inside and outside world. The transitional object bridges the gap between the self and the non-self. It is situated between autoeroticism (the thumb) and narcissism (the soft toy) and functions as a steppingstone to the world of objects. According to Ruhs the fantasy of the object as container of the self, loses importance at a later stage and another intermediary emerges, which he terms the 'transitional subject'. Between narcissism and entry into the symbolic order, the Lacanian au-Nom-du-Pere, an object arises, which is no longer object and not yet subject. Situated between the soft toy (Narcissus) and other human being (Oedipus) the transitional subject may be a living creature or an artefact. A human-like soul is projected on manmade objects. When the transitional subject is a living creature, full human subjectivity is denied to it in respect to rationalisation and intellectualisation. Models, stars, heroes, dwarfs, apes, angels, primitives and the like are transitional subjects. The insane - men and women suffering from mental disorders - also belong to this category. Works from Gugging - good image on a good screen How to reach a form that gazes at or touches the spectator? What is physical volume, or an object with inherent emptiness? What is a visual object that contains the loss, destruction, and disappearance of objects or bodies, that is captured unsatisfactorily by a network of referential co-ordinates on the screen through which we apprehend the world? Nothing in works from Gugging makes them more inherently suitable to eliciting projections than any other images. The nature of the artefacts themselves does not induce transfers more easily than any other objects. It is the spectator's knowledge that psychiatric patients create the imagery. It is the nature of the screen that makes them perfect sites for projection. The inherent emptiness is the awareness that one is contemplating imagery produced by disintegrated subjects. As transitional subjects outside the symbolic order, outside dichotomised thinking and outside logo-centric discourse, the mentally disordered are creatures to whom full human subjectivity is denied. As a psychiatrist at the AKH (general hospital) in Vienna put it, psychotics are immersed in the collective unconsciousness. The pictorial products of such transitional subjects confirm the normally functioning subjectivity of the viewer who gazes at them. The paintings, drawings and sculptures stand in for their insane creators in contemporary western societies where contact with the mentally disordered is relatively rare. Psychiatry has filtered madness out and locked it away in mental institutes at the margins, yet in times when subjective coherence is threatened, the subject craves contact with transitional subjects. In the case of the insane, the viewer has to be content with 149</page><page sequence="20">an object, which is constantly referred to in terms of its insane maker. In a dialectical process, subject and object construct one another. The viewer animates the imagery and the imagery animates the viewer. Even though the materialistic approach (what I see is what I see) within the field of vision is cynical and the belief approach (I see what I know) is ecstatic, they have one aim in common: the repression of emptiness, the denial of death. In the case of the Gugging imagery, it is the death of the coherent subject in psychosis. The paintings, drawings and objects are material traces of their 'mentally-deviant' creators and evoke a loss, namely the impossibility of gaining access to the realm of insanity by way of the symbolic. Madness is counterproductive to any linguistic order and in this sense it is truly anarchical. Imagery from Gugging contains a punctum in so far as the works function as signs for the contemplating subject's own possible insanity, disintegration and destruction. The individual needs to be confronted with something more or less a human in order to ascertain and confirm his/her own full subjectivity. When confronted with the fundamentally other in the form of insanity, the subject desires some small portion of him/herself as a kind of security belt. Along with prevailing ignorance about the actual nature of insanity and the vast space for interpretations that goes with this void of reliable knowledge, my work here provides a further explanation for the incorporative logic of the narcissistic and idiopathic contemplation of images from beyond the 'normal'.
