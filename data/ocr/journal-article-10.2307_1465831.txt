<plain_text><page sequence="1">God's Phallus and Other Problems for Men and Monotheism. By Howard Eilberg-Schwartz. Beacon Press, 1994. 312 pages $27.50 Three disciplinary traditions shape this book: gender criticism, psychoana- lytic criticism, and anthropology. The book draws on these disciplines to extend and complicate the feminist critique of God in monotheistic religions, particu- larly in Judaism. The book argues that the masculinity of God is problematic not only for women but for men as well. While the feminist critique of the deifica- tion of God considers masculinity in the deity and in humanity as the same, psychoanalytic methods identify the conflicts between these masculinities. The paradoxes generated by the conflictual relationship between God the father and the "other" son explain fundamental values, rituals, and symbols in Judaism; like, for example, the injunction against images, circumcision, and the exclusion of women from religious contexts. One aspect of the conflict between the human and the divine male is the fre- quent depiction of Israel and God as spouses and lovers. The problem arising from this depiction is that men were presented as having a marital and sexual relationship with a male divinity. To suppress the homoerotic element in this representation, a prohibition against depicting God was promulgated. In addi- tion, the male sex of God was suppressed. But the sexlessness of the father God was problematic in a culture defined by patrilineal descent. For real men an identification with a sexless God was problematic because this image did not vali- date their role as fathers. Eilberg-Schwartz distinguishes between masculinity of the divine father and of the "other" son, namely, the son who cannot quite attain the desirable projected image of the divine characteristics of sexlessness. To be like God men must not procreate and they must not have sexual desire. Eilberg-Schwartz challenges the common definition of Judaism as a purely monotheistic religion that consistently rejected anthropomorphic representations of God. He argues that in Judaism God does have a body and that the tendency</page><page sequence="2">200 Journal of the American Academy of Religion to spiritualize his body derives from later Greek sources. Authentic Jewish sources emphasize God's body, notably the extremities (face, arms, feet). What these sources reveal is not the suppression of God's body but rather the aversion of the gaze. The gaze is averted as an act of modesty and respect. Eilberg- Schwartz cites several texts involving God's feet, for example, and argues that the feet deflect attention from God's midsection. Feet are frequently used as a euphemism for penis in the Bible (e.g., the book of Ruth). The suppression of God's male sex results in a deflection of the gaze to God's extremities. The cover- up of the divine father's body is analogous to the hiding of the human father's nakedness. Eilberg-Schwartz analyzes the story of Noah and his sons with spe- cial attention to the positive portrayal of Shem, the son who averted his gaze from his father's nakedness. The cover-up expresses respect and obedience as well as modesty. Shame about nakedness is a foundational moment in the emer- gence of human culture. An Israelite male who gazed at God was like Ham, the son who did not avert his gaze from his father's nakedness. Prophetic literature frequently imagines the relationship between Israel and God as a marriage. God is the husband and Israel the wife. As part of a female collectivity, Israelite men were placed in a homoerotic relationship with God. The phallus of God (the author uses this term as interchangeable with the penis) thus represented a scandal in Jewish religious mythology. The solution for this scandal was the aversion of the gaze, the suppression of God's sex and by exten- sion the denial of God's body altogether. The aniconic impulse, the prohibition on images, is often regarded as the most distinctive aspect of Israelite religion. Eilberg-Schwartz's analysis of the homoerotic element in the relationship between the community of Israel and the male God offers a revolutionary expla- nation of this distinctive characteristic of Jewish monotheism. In the context of a heterosexual model of desire, an intimate of a male God should be female. This model explains the feminization of men in Judaism. The process of feminization is made possible through the symbolic ritual of circum- cision. Ideally, circumcision is an injury inflicted by the father on the son to sig- nify their submission to God. For ancient Israelite men, circumcision was a symbol of male submission. The rabbis understood that they had to assume the position of women vis-a-vis the male God. The allegorical interpretation of the Song of Songs sees God as a male lover and Israel as a beloved woman. Rabbinic readings of the Song of Songs reflect a broader tendency to see women's experi- ences as useful for understanding the relationship between God and man. The conflict between heterosexual marriage and the love of God necessitates the removal of women from the intimate encounter between men and God. Moses is the only biblical figure that the rabbis imagine as feasting on the sight of God. Appropriately, Moses removes himself from the company of women during his intimate encounters with God. Moses is also the one who orders the Israelites to exclude the women from their midst during the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. Eilberg-Schwartz suggests that Moses is the symbol of the rabbinic anxiety about the conflict between being married and loving (a male) God. The exclu- sion and marginalization of women is a symptom of the paradoxical relationship between the male God and the female people.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 201 Eilberg-Schwartz suggests that instead of feminizing men so they can have an intimate relationship with a male God, we might feminize this God without always making Him into a Goddess. The author cites previous work by feminist theologians who detected feminine aspects in the biblical God. In his opinion, the use of both masculine and feminine images by both men and women opens up the possibility of various forms of intimate relations to the divine. The addi- tion of nurturing and maternal images of God to the conventional repertoire of images of God as king and warrior will re-establish a much needed balance. The lack of this balance required the suppression of the body and the free expression of sexuality. The restoration of this balance will permit us to establish a freely intimate relationship with an embodied God. A feminized God may validate the much needed loving and nurturing father whose absence wounded so many men. In addition to offering fresh insights into familiar issues (the prohibition of iconic images, the precept of circumcision), Eilberg-Schwartz inserts the ques- tion of gender into the center of the study of Judaism as a religion and a mythol- ogy. This book will make it difficult for scholars of Judaism to regard questions of gender as incidental or irrelevant to the study of Jewish culture.
