THE SYNTACTICAL THEORY OF BELIEF Stephen P. Stich, in From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against Belief offers a purely syntactical theory ofthe mind (STM) in opposition to the traditional intentional representational theory of the mind (RTM). Stich's purpose is to banish beliefs and all other intentional states or propositional attitudes in antiquated unscientific 'folk psychology' from a projected mature cognitive science. He explains: The alternative [to the Strong Representational Theory of the Mind] is what I will call the Syntactical Theory of the Mind. Cognitive theories which cleave to the STM pattern treat mental states as relations to purely syntactic mental sentence tokens, and they detail the interactions among mental states in terms of the formal or syntactic properties of these tokens.1 Stich's term 'purely syntactic' refers to syntax devoid of semantics, entirely without interpretation. This is especially clear somewhat later in his exposition when he adds: The example I want to consider here takes as its abstract objects a class of sentences or, better, well-formed formulas (wffs) with the simple underlying syntax of first-order quantification theory. It will sometimes be convenient to talk of this class of sentences as a language. But it is important not to be misled by this terminology. The language is no more than an infinite class of complex syntactic objects. It has no semantics.2 1 Stephen P.

Stich's main purpose in advancing the Syntactical Theory of the Mind or STM is to offer grounds for eliminating all intention, content, and representation from psychological theory, leaving only forms of pure syntax and causal interactions of their brain tokens with neural-behavioural mechanisms. I have not argued, nor do I believe, that psychological states which are individuated along narrow causal lines should be eliminated from cognitive science. Indeed ... I will argue that the narrow causal standard or something very close to it ought to be (and often is) respected in serious cognitive science. But if this is right, then since the folk notion of belief is at odds with the narrow cognitive standard, it has no place in a mature cognitive science... As I see it, the notion of 'content' or the folk psychological strategy of identifying a mental state by appeal to a 'content sentence', despite all its utility in the workaday business of dealing with our fellow creatures, is simply out of place when our goal is the construction of a scientific theory about the mechanisms underlying behavior.3 Stich's scientific goal of advancing a theory about the mechanisms of behaviour, arguably begs the question against philosophers and scientists who believe that mechanistic behavioural psychology is inherently incapable of capturing all relevant truths about psychological phenomena. Ofcourse if we want only a mechanical theory of behaviour, then intentional concepts will have no place. What is disputed is whether such a theory can provide an adequate psychology.4 Stich's proposal has no prospect of succeeding where other reductive strategies in psychology have disastrously failed unless he can convincingly argue that these intuitive truths beyond the mechanics of bodily behaviour are apparent only, and in reality unworthy of consideration. If, when the dust settles, all he can effectively demonstrate is that intentional concepts are external to a cognitive science of behavioural mechanisms, then what he has shown is not that by that score we must abandon intentional concepts and admit that belief and desire are fictions of our once primitive folk efforts to do psychology, but instead that we must look beyond the impoverished 3 Ibid., pp. 109-10. 4 The argument is developed in an especially thorough and sustained criticism by Joseph Margolis, Philosophy of Psychology (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1984).</page><page sequence="3">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 171 limitations of even the most mature cognitive science for a philosophically satisfactory theory of psychological phenomena. Stich believes that if a concept has no place in what he calls a mature cognitive science, then it is slated for inevitable scientific discrediting. If mature cognitive science is stipulatively defined as providing no more than the mechanics of behaviour, then the conclusion is foregone in an obvious, uninteresting way, and we will not have taken a single step beyond the long- established position that intentional properties are physically-mechanically irreducible, nor will we have justification for accepting a cognitive science of purely syntactical brain sentence tokens as an ultimate explanation of psychological phenomena. Stich's explicit starting place guarantees that no interesting theoretical or metatheoretical conclusions will be forthcoming from his philosophical investigations. II. THE IDENTITY PROBLEM FOR PURELY SYNTACTICAL BRAIN SENTENCE TOKENS Stich claims an advantage for the syntactical theory of mind in the assertion that it is difficult, if not impossible, to extend folk psychological concepts to ideologically distant subjects. In the category of the ideologically distant he includes intelligent animals, retarded or brain-injured adult humans, and prelinguistic children. In these cases it is admittedly difficult to attribute beliefs, desires, and intentions, on the model of our own experiences but beyond their limits.5 The syntactical theory is supposed to avoid these limitations. In chapter 7, section 3 our focus was on ideological similarity, and the persistent problem was that as subjects became increasingly ideologically distant from ourselves, we lost our folk psychological grip on how to characterize their beliefs. For a syntactic theory, however, ideological similarity poses no problem, since the characterization of a B-state does not depend on the B-states that the subject happens to have. A B-state will count as a token of a wffif its potential causal links fit the pattern detailed in the theorist's generalizations, regardless of the further B-states the subject may have or lack.6 This seems wrong, and it is hard to see how Stich's purely syntactic theory of mind could possibly have the advantage he asserts for it. If we have trouble 5 Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Sczence, pp. 158-62. 6 Ibid., p. 158.</page><page sequence="4">172 DALE JACQUETTE identifying belief content ascription sentences for those ideologically distant from us, including children, animals, the retarded and brain injured, how much more difficult must it be to identify semantic-free syntax tokens (if such a concept were not to begin with a contradictio in adjecto, if semantic-free pure syntax were conceptually possible) in distant subjects, especially nonhuman animals and prelinguistic children, or the abnormally developed. What shall we look for as semantic-free pure syntax tokens in a dolphin's brain ? 'Causal connections that fit the pattern in the cognitive scientist's generalizations' is Stich's official answer. But how far will this really take us? Literally any bit of neurophysiological matter might be a syntactic primitive. How can we tell whether in fact it is, if our working hypothesis is that is has absolutely no semantic mappings standing behind it ? Even in our own brains, we cannot expect to find material syntax token equivalents physically resembling the notational orthography of predicate logic in Principia Mathematica, except in the trivial sense of being able to locate items with the same mathematical multiplicity as a chosen logical syntax, under an isomorphism or picturing correlation. But strictly identical logical form or isomorphic mathematical multiplicity is at most a necessary, never a sufficient condition, for syntax type membership; otherwise, every object in the world would be actually, not merely potentially, syntactical, and there could be no deciphering the moving matter in a brain as information; it would at once code every sentence in every language, or, more precisely, it would code no determinate sentence in any particular language. This is why Wittgenstein in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, one of the most complete investigations of minimal syntactical requirements for language in modern analytic philosophy, does not permit fact-complexes devoid of me"ning or semantics to qualify as syntax. There must also be what he calls 'lines of projection' from fact to fact in order for any item to qualify as syntax sign or symbol.7 As John Heil in his important essay 'Does Cognitive Psychology Rest on a Mistake?' rightly maintains: In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein attempted to devise a theory of representation in which signs denoted states of affairs in virtue of an internal relation holding between those signs and their denotata. But even in the Tractatus Wittgenstein recognized the essential contribution of the language-user in establishing this relation. For even if states of affairs may usefully be thought of as having definite structures which are mirrored in our language, it is up to speakers to 7 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, ed. C. K. Ogden (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1922), 4.04-4.0411, 5.474.</page><page sequence="5">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 173 stipulate (somehow) the way the elements of states of affairs align with the elements of the items chosen as signs. We manage in some way to 'project' the form of a state of affairs into the thing we use as a sign for that state of affairs. Wittgenstein apparently regarded this act (the upshot of which was the correlation of the elements of a sign with the corresponding elements of reality) as a psychological occurrence, something to be investigated empirically.8 The same reliance on thought to make an object or complex with the appropriate logical form or mathematical multiplicity into a genuine item of syntax is found in Carnap's concept of pure syntax.9 It is at the heart of Frege's theory of Gedanken, in which thoughts are intentionally grasped, and expressed in the syntax of a language by acts of intelligence.10 The idea that there can be a 'pure' syntax purified of every trace of meaning or semantics, standing on its own and awaiting assignment of semantic structures, is a relatively recent departure from the mainstream history of philosophy of logic and language that terminates on inspection in a reductio ad absurdum. The purely syntactical brain sentence theory of mind, under fire by semantic considerations, might be thought to benefit from integration with a version of the causal theory of reference, independently developed in the philosophy of language.' But the causal theory of reference is irrelevant to Stich's project, because purely syntactical brain sentence tokens postulated by his theory have no semantic qualities of any kind, resulting from or 8 John Heil, 'Does Cognitive Psychology Rest on a Mistake?', Mind, 90 (1981), p. 334.

Kripke in his landmark lectures on Naming and Necessity offers not a casual theory of reference but what he somewhat more cautiously describes as a 'better picture' of how reference functions (Kripke, Naming and Necessity (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980), p. 93). This is what many adherents regard as a locus classicus for the causal theory of reference. But far from supposing that the chain of communication picture of reference can be used to eliminate intentionality, Kripke claims just the opposite (p. 96): 'When the name is "passed from link to link", the receiver of the name must, I think, intend when he learns it to use it with the same reference as the man from whom he heard it.' And (p. 97): 'Notice that the preceding outline hardly eliminates the notion of reference; on the contrary, it takes the notion of intending to use the same reference as a given.'</page><page sequence="6">174 DALE JACQUETTE explainable by causal, intentional, or any other relations. Stich holds that if and when brain sentence types are identified, psychological behaviour can be explained by nonsemantic causal interactions among purely syntactical brain sentence tokens. To suppose that a causal theory of reference or of the causal role of brain sentence tokens in behaviour or even behavioural dispositions can rescue the reduction is not just programmatic wishful thinking, but involves fundamental confusions about the kind of explanation causal correlations afford. If we have meaning or content to use at least provisionally in the adolescence of the syntactical theory of mind, then, since normal adult human subjects can articulate intentional states, we might be able to use that semantic information in identifying correlated brain sentence tokens in normal human adults by application of Mill's inductive methods for causal correlations. But ideologically distant subjects cannot articulate their intentional states - if they could, the primary motivation for Stich's syntactical theory of mind would evaporate, and we could presumably continue using refined folk psychological concepts and explanations. Without semantic information for ideologically distant subjects, a mature cognitive science, such as Stich conceives it, has no data to apply in identifying alien brain sentence tokens, unless ideologically distant subjects happen to have the same identifiable types of purely syntactical brain sentence tokens as the ideologically local intentional-state-articulate subjects on whose phenomenology and verbal behaviour the theory is founded. But Stich offers no reason to expect identity in brain-chemistry linguistics even for the same individual at different times, let alone for different individuals of the same species, or members of ideologically distant species. The hypothesis actually decreases in likelihood for ideologically more distant subjects, since psychological alienation increases with biological- neurophysiological alienation. Stich's cognitive science, by cutting off its transitional semantic base, can never achieve the maturity of contemporary physics, chemistry, or biology, except by precluding the kind of open-texture or open-endedness of these modern scientific methodologies. When new or unforeseen ideologically distant phenomena need to be explained by Stich's purely syntactical theory of mind, it will either have to revert to semantic data unavailable for the ideologically distant except by folk psychological projection, or implausibly limit itself to causal interactions among strictly identical types of purely syntactical brain sentence tokens in ideologically local and ideologically distant psychological, subjects. It is difficult in this arena to see what theoretical advantage the syntactical theory of mind could possibly have over suitably refined versions of intentionalist folk psychology in the scientific investigation of ideologically distant subjects.</page><page sequence="7">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 175 What is more, though Stich might plead that his examples involve a simplification for purposes of illustration, it is widely appreciated that first- order predicate logic is inadequate for representing a significant part of thought and language. Stich may believe he has successfully eliminated intensionality from common discourse by dismissing belief context opacity along with the de dicto-de re distinction as a philosophical fiction.' 2 But there remain other problematic features of ordinary thought that cannot be reduced to predicate logic, such as alethic and other modalities. Even if we could identify without semantic resources a syntactic token equivalent to the necessity or possibility operator in quantified modal logic, its function as standardly understood is intensional, and so by definition incapable of operation or explanation in terms of a syntactical mechanical recursion or recursive procedure.'3 Stich admits that he needs to reject de dicto-de re ambiguity for his syntactic theory to have any plausibility. But undermining the distinction is still not sufficient, and his challenge to the distinction is unsatisfactory for more fundamental reasons. Suppose we could identify brain syntax token equivalents of a formal logical symbolism like predicate logic, and thereby succeed where generations of mathematical logicians have failed in reducing thought and discourse to an extensional logical foundation. That alone would not give us the slightest handle on causally explaining the workings of dolphin or even our own intelligence in terms of mechanical interactions among syntax tokens, unless we first had some method for assigning syntax to designata, linking syntax token 'P' to whatever P is supposed to stand for. Otherwise, to know that Flipper has moving through his neurochemistry the supposedly pure syntax items 'P D Q', 'P', '', 'Q', by itself cannot tell us whether he will likely acquire a desire to jump for the fish, or slap the water with his sidefins. The bare syntactical schema gives us nothing, and moreover commits us to imposing our logical structures and categories in a parochial anthropomorphic and anthropocentric way that is largely discredited in field ethology. III. INTENTIONALITY OF THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE In reply to Zenon Pylyshyn's cogent criticism of the syntactic theory of mind, involving a woman's decision to flee a building she believes to be burning on 12 Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science, ch. 6: 'De Dicto and De Re: The Myth of Ambiguity', pp. 111-23. SeeJacquette, 'Stich Against De Dicto-De Re Ambiguity', Philosophical Psychology, 2 (1989), pp. 223-30. 13 The intensionality of modal contexts is shown by Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1960), pp. 191-232;'Three Grades of Modal Involvement' in The Ways ofParadox, pp. 158-64; 'Reference and Modality' in From a Logical Point of View, second revised edition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961), pp. 139-44.</page><page sequence="8">176 DALE JACQUETTE the evidence of the smell of smoke, Stich responds: 'Here then is a sketch of a purely formal or syntactical explanation of Mary's behavior.'14 He then proceeds to outline anything but a purely syntactical explanation: Why did Mary come running from the building? It's a long story. First she had a long-standing D-state whose syntactical form was that of a conditional, viz. F &gt; L (corresponding to the desire to leave the building if it is on fire), where F and L are themselves syntactically well-formed strings.15 This takes several steps back from the most plausible behaviourist explanations of reaction behaviour that, while not universally applicable, at least avoid Stich's reference to manifest occurrent or dispositional beliefs and desires. The explanation is supposed to be syntactical, but what would it explain without the (semantic) 'correspondence' of the otherwise completely uninformative conditional 'F = L' and the intentional D-state of desiring to L-leave a building if it is on F-fire ? Without this, all we have is a vacuous reduction of any and every behaviour to inference by conditional detachment, which is precisely Pylyshyn's point.16 Stich takes the offensive, and claims an advantage for his syntactic approach as against Pylyshyn's qualified intentional account. He argues that the syntactical theory is preferable because it is less likely to overlook important generalizations about subject behaviour. Stich argues in a passage worth reproducing at length: On Pylyshyn's view, what is crucial to seeing how symbols stored in memory are relevant to each other is 'a semantic interpretation of the symbols as representing something.' But I think his own example can be extended a bit to illustrate that this is exactly wrong. For suppose that in building an STM account of Mary's cognitive states we ran across some symbols to which we could not assign any semantic interpretation. Suppose, for example, that there is a symbol sequence, W, such that the syntactically conditional sequence W = F appears among Mary's long-standing B-states. Given what we already know about Mary, it would be natural to try interpreting this as a conditional belief, ascribable with a content sentence of the form: 14 Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science, p. 174. 15 Ibid., pp. 174-5. 16 Zenon W. Pylyshyn, 'Cognitive Representation and the Process-Architecture Distinc- tion', The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 3 (1980), p. 161. See Pylyshyn, Computation and Cognition (Cambridge: MIT (Bradford Books) Press, 1984).</page><page sequence="9">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 177 If , then the building is on fire. But now suppose that our best efforts at assigning a semantic interpretation to W end in failure... What I am sketching, of course, is an ideologically exotic subject, one who has concepts and beliefs sufficiently different from our own that we cannot provide the sort of semantic interpretation Pylyshyn favors. Though it would cripple any attempt to apply content-based generalizations ... the impossibility of interpretation poses no problem for a purely syntactic account of the sort I have been advocating. It is a 'semantic' or content-based theory of the sort advocated by the Strong RTM that stands to miss important generalizations, not a syntactic theory of the sort advocated by the STM.17 There are many errors in this argument. The representational theory does not renounce its right to use logical inference by detachment, even where antecedents hypothetically are uninterpreted. Stich holds that: 'The Weak RTM, however, requires that all mental sentences in the purview of a cognitive psychological theory have content or truth conditions, not merely that some tokens of some mental state types do.'18 But this does not mean that the representationalist must have fully interpreted the content of all mental sentences in a subject's profile in order to implement modus ponens. The representationalist no less than the syntacticist can equally draw the conclusion 'The building is on fire' from uninterpreted input 'W' and the partially interpreted 'W = The building is on fire'. If, as Stich repeatedly contends, the syntactical theory is comparatively more parsimonious than the representational theory, then the representational theory can surely avail itself of any devices available to the syntactical theory; it just has additional principles and requirements which Stich regards as unnecessary. Why suppose that a purely syntactical theory of mind is entitled to use truth-functional inference in the first place? If the sentence tokens in Mary's brain are regarded by mature cognitive science as purely syntactical, how can logically valid inference, a semantic relation, possibly be justified? When we have recovered the 'conditional' (is it even that ?) 'W = F' from Mary's brain chemistry, and the uninterpreted brain 'sentence" W', how can we know that for Mary it 'follows' that F, unless the truth function '=' is interpreted, unless we have something like the equivalent of a semantic truth-table matrix to interpret the material conditional in order to uphold detachment? Stich must say that in Mary's brain 'W = F' and 'W' causes 'F', and 'F' causes Mary to flee (sets in motion a certain chain of motor activity). But this 17 Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science, pp. 177-8. 18 Ibid., pp. 197-8.</page><page sequence="10">178 DALE JACQUETTE does not explain why Mary leaves the building in such haste unless 'F' is interpreted. Any number of uninterpreted brain sentence conditionals could cause precisely the same behaviour without affording reason for Mary's action. Suppose that when she smells smoke, Mary acquires the belief state we would describe by means of an intentional idiom by saying she expects an earthquake, causing detachment of the uninterpreted consequent 'F' from the uninterpreted conditional 'W = F' by occurrence of the uninterpreted 'W'. Stich cannot protest that it is inappropriate to use the same brain sentence syntax here, since uninterpreted isomorphic pure syntax items are logically interchangeable. Mary could be alternatively causally reconfigured from one moment to the next so that on the first occasion she flees because 'F' (in the intentional idiom) she believes there will soon be a fire, and on another occasion because 'F' (in the intentional idiom) she believes there will soon be an earthquake. The syntactical theory of mind fails to distinguish these distinct psychological motivations for her actions. There must be a cause for the change in Mary's brain configuration, but the point is that the very existence of such a change will be hidden from Stich's syntactical theorist if brain sentence tokens are uninterpreted, since by hypothesis everything else remains the same. If changes occur, but the same uninterpreted brain sentence tokens remain, there is no method within the syntactical theory of mind to determine whether Mary bids her hasty retreat because of her fear of fire or earthquake. According to Stich, we are better off with the syntactical theory of mind in explaining Mary's impromptu flight. But the theory requires that we can look for and identify microscopic pure syntax in the tissues of her brain. This is no more possible without semantic analysis than trying to decide whether a chance alignment of planets constitutes a sentence token in Morse code. If Stich's explanation appeals to the semantically uninterpreted pure syntax string 'W ~ X', his account amounts to an application of extensionally reductive materialist brain chemistry. Then why call 'W = X' a sentence token in the first place, if it is a semantically uninterpreted sequence of material substances moving through the subject's brain ? Why not just offer a nonlinguistic efficient causal brain-chemistry reduction of all psychological phenomena? Stich finally appeals to the relative simplicity of a purely syntactic theory of mind compared to its representational rivals. He writes: 'to put the matter most simply, the virtue of STM theories is that they eliminate the middleman'.19 Then he continues: 19 Ibid., p. 158.</page><page sequence="11">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 179 The mental states postulated by an STM theory are not characterized by their content sentences but, rather, by the syntactic objects to which they are mapped... By eliminating the middleman, STM theories are able to characterize the cognitive states of a subject in terms appropriate to the subject rather than in terms that force a comparison between the subject and the theorist.20 This brings us back to the advantage claimed for the STM approach over RTM theories. Having eliminated the representational belief sentence middleman as a basis for comparison between subject and theorist, are we not still saddled with differences in syntax between subject and theorist? How else is the theorist to recognize syntax in the subject except in terms of his own syntax, already implying a translation semantics and a privileged semantic perspective without which bits of matter in the subject's brain could never qualify as a syntax in the theorist's judgement? This is doubtless why Fodor, Dennett, and others, have insisted on the role of content and representation in (modular) functionalist cognitive psychology.21 Stich has eliminated the middleman, but in this enterprise it is the middleman alone who delivers the goods, without whom, without semantic content, there is nothing to sell, no advantages of simplicity or economy.22 This is not to say that no psychological phenomena can be explained by the causal activity of material syntax token equivalents in a subject's neurophysiology. But if an object is a syntax item, it is so only by virtue of semantic mappings and correlations that intentionally single out particular entities of particular types as potentially significant, as syntactical if, and only if, meaningful. Syntax, 'pure' syntax, is not the final chapter, the ultimate ground of explanation. The intentionality of thought makes object types and tokens into syntax, and without this they could not qualify as syntactical and so never as purely syntactical. The status of syntax is conferred on objects by thought, by the intentionality Stich seeks to eliminate, without which there is no syntax properly so-called. It is strange that in this context Stich should compare his use and discarding of intentional folk psychological concepts in the assignment of causal roles to purely syntactical brain sentence tokens to Wittgenstein's discarded ladder at the end of the Tractatus, especially since Wittgenstein clearly recognizes that thought confers syntaxhood on complexes by 20 Ibid. 21 Jerry Fodor, Representations (Cambridge: MIT (Bradford Books) Press, 1981), pp. 25-6.

'It is, after all,' Stich proclaims, 'a venerable tradition to kick away ladders once we have climbed them.'23 To this, a recent critic has returned the quip: 'Stich's problem lies in kicking away ladders while they are still in use.'24 Intentionality comes before syntax, and without it there is no syntax. This means that syntax can never occur as pure in the sense Stich requires. Syntax or pure syntax therefore cannot be invoked in attempts to eliminate intentionality. IV. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE MYTH OF PURE SYNTAX Myths are stubborn things to eradicate from science and philosophy. The myth of pure syntax is sure to enjoy currency for some time to come. It does harm only by encouraging unrealizable projects and overly simplistic theories in linguistics, philosophy, and science. The presentation of a formal language in terms first of syntax and then semantics contributes to the myth by making it appear that the two are separable and the choice of objects to be made into expressions arbitrary. But the objects first of all must have the requisite isomorphic logical form or mathematical multiplicity to function as signs for particular states of affairs. The order of presentation in the introduction of a formal symbolic system in any case does not recapitulate order of discovery, determination, or ontological priority. The notation of a formal system is developed by choosing object-types to serve as syntactical expressions for pre-existing concepts. Typically a minimal, primitive selection of these is abstracted, and formation rules are laid down to license manufacture of more complex expressions. But realistically from the start the objects must already be endowed with at least some meaning in order to constitute and function as syntax. The myth of pure syntax is widespread, and thrives in philosophical interpretations of artificial intelligence, where it is sometimes said that pure syntax, the shapes of symbols magnetically stored and manipulated by mechanical algorithms, can by appropriate programming exactly duplicate the semantic features of natural intelligence. John Haugeland has recently formulated this view in the 'FORMALIST'S MOTTO: If you take care of 23 Ibid., p. 183. See Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 6.54. 24 Kevin Possin, 'The Case Against Stephen Stich's Syntactic Theory of Mind', Philosophical Studies, 49 (1986), p. 410. See Lilly-Marlene Russow, 'Stich on the Foundations of Cognitive Science', Synthese, 70 (1987), pp. 401-13; Terence Horgan and James Woodward, 'Folk Psychology is Here to Stay', The Philosophical Review, 94 (1985), pp. 197-226.</page><page sequence="13">INTENTIONALITY AND STICH'S THEORY 181 the syntax, the semantics will take care of itself.'25 But if there is no pure syntax, no syntax without semantics, then the formalist motto is otiose. Taking care of syntax is not separable from taking care of the semantics, and semantics does not simply fall in line or tumble out with any imagined computation of pure syntax. The only remedy against the misunderstandings of minds and machines that this kind of slogan engenders is to recognize the myth of pure syntax for what it is, and resist the implications that might otherwise be thought to follow from the existence of a pure syntax which machines could mechanically process to produce intrinsic intentionality, semantics, and the emergence of mind. The future of folk psychological concepts in cognitive studies is not so much a question of whether particular folk psychological concepts in ordinary parlance survive and find a place in a mature scientific psychology. Terms like 'belief,' 'desire', and their ilk may indeed be vague or otherwise unsuitable for scientific explanatory purposes. The interesting problem is whether an advanced satisfactory cognitive science can do entirely without any intentional concepts. It is sometimes unreflectively assumed that a denunciation of current folk psychological concepts on the basis of their admitted shortcomings somehow detracts from the idea of intentional psychological concepts per se. There is something quaint and old fashioned, prejudicially unscientific about a 'folk' concept; the name indicates a preliminary idea leading to something more sophisticated and intellectually respectable. 'The very fact that it is a folk theory should make us suspicious', Stich claims. 'For in just about every other domain one can think of, the ancient shepherds and camel drivers whose speculations were woven into folk theory have had a notoriously bad track record.'26 A technical, less vague or nebulous, but no less intentional vocabulary might be needed for exact scientific description and explanation. Stich agrees that there is a useful, though provisional and eliminable, purpose served by intentional content or semantic correlations and meaning interpretations. Perhaps science can begin with a belief or desire sentence ascribing meaning to a syntax item, and then regard the item as semantic- free, a purely syntactical construction. This, however, accomplishes nothing towards understanding even the nonsemantic causal role of brain sentences. Stich might allow the theory or metatheory to contain some intentional folk psychological idioms while the mature scientific cognitive theory does not. But cognitive science does not work the way Stich expects it to unless brain syntax is impure, and brain sentence tokens are considered to be interpreted whenever they occur. The theory cannot perform as it is supposed to unless 25 John Haugeland, Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea (Cambridge: MIT (Bradford Books) Press, 1985), p. 106; also pp. 100-10. 26 Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science, p. 229.</page><page sequence="14">182 DALE JACQUETTE intentional semantic content correlations are part of the theory itself, and not relegated merely to an extrascientific metatheory.27 The Pennsylvania State University 27 I wish to thank the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung for supporting this research, and the Philosophisches Seminar der Universitat Mannheim for hosting my extended study during 1989-90.</page></plain_text>
