<plain_text><page sequence="1">354 jac Visual Rhetorical Analysis: The Case of Smokey Bear Sally Gomaa Marguerite Helmers' interdisciplinary study, "Hybridity, Ethos, and Visual Representations of Smokey Bear," is compelling on several levels. The main focus of her study is the persuasiveness of Smokey Bear visual representations. The clear intention of these representations is to induce audiences to adopt certain behaviors and codes of conduct towards wildlife. Smokey Bear was originally created during World War II as part of an advertising campaign led by the USDA and the Ad Council to fight wildfires. After World War II, more cultural work was needed to define humans ' relationship to the wild due to "the rise in technologies of tourism, such as the car, television, film, advertising, roads, and campsites" (Helmers 5 1). Smokey Bear evolved to meet this need. That is, Smokey Bear's role, Helmers argues, was not only to persuade audiences to prevent wildfires, but also to create a public ethos at the core of American environmental and civic values. T o develop this argument, Helmers draws from anumber of disciplines, such as animal studies, rhetorical theory, and art history, an interdisciplinary approach typical of scholarship in the field of visual rhetoric. Specifically, the subject of Helmers' writing is the rhetorical making of Smokey Bear. Her "purpose" is to study how his "animal/human hybridism constructs human response" (48), with constructs referring both to "Smokey Bear" as well as the audience "Smokey Bear" con- structs. Smokey's audience should have shared values and assumptions towards wildlife in general and towards anthropomorphic animal figures in particular. However, because of his moralistic stance on wildfires, Smokey Bear has to remain suspended in a representational space between "what is real and what is imaginary" (54). He has to somehow maintain his hybridism as an anthropomorphic representative of wildlife that understands human behavior. In the following, I will examine Helmers' study of the persuasiveness of Smokey Bear visual representa- tions (mainly Smokey's "ethos"); I will extend her ideas on the imagined communities of spectators constructed by Smokey Bear; and, finally, I will</page><page sequence="2">Response Essays 355 relate Helmers' work in the case of Smokey Bear to the field of visual rhetoric in general. Ethos: If Smokey Bear Could Speak The main case for Smokey Bear's persuasiveness is his ethos. It is ethos that Aristotle recognizes as "the most effective means of persuasion" (qtd. in Helmers 48). According to Aristotle, "the personal goodness revealed by the speaker contributes ... to his persuasion" (bk. 1, ch. 2). Which aspects of his human half (Smokey) and his animal half (Bear) highlight this "personal goodness"? Helmers finds that the "unspoken trace in Smokey's mediated and fictional animality is his alignment with white, working-class males" (48). In his j eans and his hat, Smokey is designed to be strong, rugged, and masculine (Helmers makes a connection to a 1 938 poster, "The Spirit of CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps]"). His animal half, on the other hand, mythologizes his life in the wild. For example, he is represented as "the mythical and mediated Papa Bear, protecting his family from the red flames that rage on the horizon" (59). Not only is pathos employed in this example, but there is also something morally compelling about Smokey's righteous yet helpless position as defender of the forest. It is through assuming this nuanced moral position that one identifies with Smokey, which adds to the persuasiveness of Smokey's ethos. According to Kenneth Burke, one is concerned with rhetoric as identification whenever one is "striving to form himself in accordance with the communicative norms that match the cooperative ways of his society" (39). Smokey Bear representations draw from existing "communicative norms" (domestication and humanization of animals) and "cooperative ways" (stewardship and patriotism) to effect persuasion. Identification with Smokey thus assumes a community of viewers with shared values. However, identification with Smokey Bear exposes the limits and excesses of representation: Smokey is an anthropomorphic figure who does not directly speak. The verbal message is communicated through "an unnamed intermediary, one who identifies him in the third person as 'Smokey,' an omniscient narrator" (Helmers 56). This over-voice main- tains Smokey's mystique while ensuring humans' implied or desired</page><page sequence="3">356 jac domination over wildlife. Smokey' s function is defined by "human desires, codes of conduct, and federal regulations" (50) rather than by any knowledge of bears. For example, in a 1 949 poster analyzed by Helmers, Smokey appears as a teacher instructing a young bear. This visual narrative is "muddled," however, because the moral of the visual story concerns not bears but humans who are instructed to "'Hold 'til it's cold: prevent forest fire'" (61). This warning is issued in the third person, "Smokey says." Helmers sees in this "ambivalent rhetoric" an appeal "to both the friend and the foe, the steward of nature as well as the careless camper" (57). This ambivalence also exposes the excessiveness of the desire to humanize Smokey only to control and take advantage of his hybridism. If Smokey Bear could speak, he would be a moralizing human masquerading in bear skin. But Smokey' s story tells another story: the story of the spectators who view him. Therefore, in order to understand Smokey Bear, one has to understand the human agency hailed by the omniscient narrator. Smokey' s World The desire to protect wildlife is born, Helmers indicates, out of a complex network of patriotism, environmentalism, Disney movies, humans' sense of entitlement, their desire to exercise mastery over nature, and so on. In order for Smokey' s hybridism to speak to these various interests, the "absolute difference between a human us and an animal them" has to be "blurred" (Helmers 47). This section will focus on how this blurring occurs in order to investigate the ideaof community implied in Helmers' analysis. Helmers writes that there is a "reciprocal" construction in the making of Smokey Bear: Smokey himself is called into being by the presence of the "you" in the discourse, because it implies "I." The second person functions like Althusser's hailing. It extends an invitation to accept, to recognize the self in the "you" being addressed. (56-57) This reference to Althusser's hailing has important implications. In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses," Althusser writes that</page><page sequence="4">Response Essays 357 "ideology 'acts' or 'functions' in such a way that it 'recruits' subjects amongthe individuals ... or 'transforms' the individuals into subjects" by the operation of what he calls " interpellation or hailing" (163). The omniscient narrator of Smokey's story hails "you" as an actor, a subject, and an agent called upon to enter Smokey's world, to see his point. Individuals are recruited into an ideology by recognizing "that they really do occupy the place it designates for them as theirs in the world, a fixed residence" (Althusser 166). Therefore, recognizing "you" in "only you can prevent fire" already recruits "you" into the process of preventing wildfire. Furthermore, the line between us and them is blurred once one internalizes the code of conduct Smokey Bear represents. Althusser explains that in order for subjects to "'work by themselves,"' ideology operates on a "duplicate mirror-structure" ( 1 69, 1 68). That is, interpellating individuals as subjects is " speculary " (169). One must see in Smokey Bear not a bear at all, but areflection (literally and figuratively) of oneself acting consci- entiously towards nature. This reflection of human desires is not a confrontation but a hierarchy, us over them. As a rhetorical case, then, Smokey constructs a world that transcends the frame of the visual representation by co-opting "you." The more successful the omniscient narrator is in hailing "you," the less of Smokey's body is needed. In fact, later representations of Smokey use only his head. Spectators of Smokey Bear "work by themselves," in Althusser's words, once the slightest invocation of Smokey Bear ushers in a history of rhetorical and cultural artifacts, hailing us into good stewardship and citizenship. Helmers' visual rhetorical analysis of Smokey Bear is concerned both with the construction of Smokey's ethos and with the construction of communities of viewers with shared ideologies. She describes how mediated animals have the power to "bring us together as a public with a shared consciousness" (66). In Smokey Bear's case, this shared con- sciousness comprises "patriotic idealism" (64) and "stewardship and environmental responsibility" (54). Thus, "being able to wear the emblems and representations of Smokey Bear allow[s] us all to ' Get [Our] Smokey On'" while conveniently demonstrating "one of the finest human at- tributes: care for others" (54). Visitors to SmokeyBear.com can buy t- shirts, posters, mug holders, and so forth. But what they are really buying is membership in a community of people who have leisure, time, and money</page><page sequence="5">358 jac to travel. Therefore, like Bourdieu's habitus, Smokey Bear representa- tions are designed to regulate human conduct without appearing to be regulating at all. Smokey represents what Bourdieu calls "dispositions" and "structures" that are "'regulated' and 'regular' without being in any way the product of obedience to rules" and "collectively orchestrated without being the product of the organizing action of a conductor" (qtd. in Johnson 5). That is, one is predisposed to respond positively to Smokey's appeal because this appeal appears as if "collectively" initiated and upheld. Smokey Bear in his jeans and his ranger's hat, in the circumstances of his birth, and in his performance of a "civic function" is quintessentially American (Helmers 66). What is at stake in the design of Smokey Bear is how much of that design appeals to one's desire to be American and of how "American" is interpreted. A Meta-Critical Response: Visual Rhetorical Analysis Helmers' study of Smokey Bear representations is important not only for the light it sheds on Smokey Bear as a "construct" (5 1 ), as an "advertising campaign" (64), and as a "moral social being" (51), but also for the guidance it offers in the field of visual rhetoric. In the following, I will trace Helmers' methodology: what does a visual rhetorical analysis look like? At this point, it would have been most convenient for me to invoke a working definition of visual rhetoric. Unfortunately, no such definition exists. The field of visual rhetoric is fluid, interdisciplinary, and /«disciplinary, a specific term adopted by Helmers and Hill in their introduction to Defining Visual Rhetorics. Their intention is to "study the relationship of visual images to persuasion" (1). Inasmuch as a visual image induces a response or elicits a meaning, it is persuasive. A number of important questions follow: Where, then, should the rhetorician who is interested in analyzing visual images begin? What bodies of scholarship are essential to master? What terms should rhetoricians adopt? Are some images more suitable than others for the study of images in rhetorical theory? (3)</page><page sequence="6">Response Essays 359 These questions point to the complex, evasive, and intermediary nature of visual rhetoric. Helmers and Hill stress that they did not have a set definition of visual rhetoric in mind when they selected contributions to their book. Instead, they asked for contributions from authors already engaged with their own definitions. Nevertheless, Helmers and Hill found "a surprising level of agreement" across contributions that no "clear demarcation" shouldbe drawn "between 'visual' and 'verbal' texts" (20). V isual rhetoric, they suggest, should not be concerned with the domination of the verbal over the visual or vice versa but with the convergence of the visual and the verbal to generate meaning in a given text. This conver- gence, however, does not make answering the questions quoted above any easier. Whenever one is engaged with the challenge of responding to a visual rhetorical analysis (the way I am in undertaking to write this response), one should pay attention not only to the conventions of exigency, argument, and scholarship, and so forth, but also to how the analysis is conceptualized (what questions drive it) and strategized (how those questions are to be answered). This double or meta-critical response is suggested by Helmers and Hill's work. Instead of trying to establish a fixed definition of visual rhetoric, they recommend that "at least for a while, it would be more productive to continue pushing against existing disciplinary boundaries and to maintain the 'indiscipline' status, continuing to question all current practices while developing new ones" (21). That is, in addition to understanding what Helmers has to say about Smokey Bear, the amor- phous, overdetermined, and cross-disciplinary nature of visual rhetoric requires one to understand how Helmers turns "Smokey Bear" into a field of investigation. Read as a case study in visual rhetoric, how does Helmers' investigation exemplify the workof visual rhetoricians? What do visual rhetoricians do? To begin with, Helmers rhetoricizes Smokey Bear: she looks at the relationship between visual representations of Smokey Bear and persua- sion. First, as discussed above, she finds that Smokey has a distinctive ethos communicated visually through his clothing and verbally through statements attributed to him. She argues that the creators of Smokey's representations moved from pathos to logos. Her analysis of how this move is visually effected intervenes in various disciplinary conventions,</page><page sequence="7">360 jac but it asks questions specific to visual rhetoric: A visual rhetorical analysis of the potential of mediated animals to construct human response will question what the animals do within the text. In addition, it is important to seek moments of subversion, points when the mediated animals break from the frame to confront the human codes of signification. (50) A visual rhetorical analysis studies both the animal within the frame and the relationship between the spectator and the framed animal. However, whether this relationship is an identification or a confrontation, it is a chance for the mediated animal to look back: "The reflexivity of vision, in which the observed animal stares back at the viewer and challenges the audience's habituated ways of seeing, is an essential element of visual rhetorical study" (50). Why is this reflexivity essential? Because it is a reversal of the way "Smokey Bear" is viewed. A rhetorical investigation shows that what is constructed is not only Smokey or Bambi or Mickey Mouse, but a spectatorship with communal and cultural ties. Why should a fictional bear be more effective in influencing human decision making? "Uncomfortably, it is because humans feel less threatened by the animal due to the animal ' s long history of being embedded in cultural texts that serve human interests" (66). Helmers is thus able to link the visual analysis of Smokey Bear to larger questions that deal with represen- tation and persuasion. By becoming an "icon," Smokey Bear has managed to survive the initial period of his conception and to continue performing "a civic function" (66) in the shaping of an American nationalistic ideal. To conclude, a visual rhetorical analysis that follows Helmers' example starts with rhetoricizing visual representations. That is, it starts with effectively deploying concepts from rhetorical theory, such as ethos and topos in Helmers' analysis of Smokey Bear, to study the relationship between visual images and persuasion. It needs to historicize these images, placing the moment of their first conception within specific historical and cultural dynamics. It does not privilege the verbal over the visual or vice versa, but tries to borrow from and reverse disciplinary conventions and hierarchies. Rather than providing answers, it poses more questions. "It is this openness," Helmers and Hill write, "this resistance to</page><page sequence="8">Response Essays 361 closure, that drew us to the field of rhetoric in the first place" (21). Visual rhetoric is still the art of persuasion, but it is an art in the process of acquiring new tools, conventions, vocabulary, and practices. Helmers' work in the case of Smokey Bear is particularly instructive in the way it shows the scope and the potential of this exciting field of investigation.
