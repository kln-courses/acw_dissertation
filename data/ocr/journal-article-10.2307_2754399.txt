<plain_text><page sequence="1">Congress, Dead or Alive A Review Article cc HE OWL OF MINERVA spreads its wings only with the falling of the 1 dusk." The appearance of two substantial studies of the Indian Congress party' in the period since the elections of i967 may prompt echoes of the Hegelian dictum, if not coarser comments on missing the bus or finding the patient dead. Surely, some may argue, the students of Congress are in a position resembling that which Hegel ascribed to philosophy itself: they have "come on the scene too late to give instruction as to what the world ought to be." By what they now say, the world of Congress "cannot be rejuvenated but only understood." That places before us two sets of questions, one about Congress, the other about the authors' understanding of it. Is it the case that Congress has grown old in the sense of having moved into a decline from which, if not rejuvenated, it will die? Do our authors offer an explanation of Congress-up-to-i967 that will assist us to an understanding of Congress-after-i967? Of course, Hegel may be a merely playful, not very helpful point at which to start. We may not see eye to eye with him about the nature of institutions, and we may not share his conception of philosophy. As to the former we are probably less attracted by organic views. For us, "body politic" is at best a treacherous metaphor. Only infrequently can we assign a date of birth to an institution; never would we allow ourselves to think of its having a natural life-span. Why should the British parliament, the United States presidency, the Italian Communist party ever die? The King is dead; long live the King. Institutions are not persons. Antibiotics and accident- prevention can help humans to live longer, but the notion of life expectancy is meaningless if applied to an institution. From the age of an institution one can tell little or nothing about the number of years it still has to go. If any proposition on this could be argued it would probably be that the longer an institution's past the longer its future. With institutions adaptability is everything. Congress is eighty-four this year, but this tells us nothing more than that it has proved adaptable to environmental change over the period since its birth. This may in turn suggest that it could, through the transmission 1 Stanley A.

I99</page><page sequence="2">Pacific AFairs of skills of adjustment, by now have acquired some built-in flexibility. But against this there are the suspicions that the party is weary, its reactions sluggish, its arteries hardened. The latter view may be correct not because but in spite of its anthropomorphic metaphor: for instance, fresh leadership recruitment could have slowed down (and actual leaders could indeed be weary). The a priori balancing of such general possibilities does not take us very far. We have to examine the behaviour of the party. This is a difficult task, for the collection, selection, and interpretation of the evidence all pose knotty problems. What we should be looking for presumably is a delineation of the types of environmental change to which the party has hitherto been able to adapt itself successfully, together with an analysis of the internal resources it has been able to call upon for this purpose. There would remain the further task of assessing whether present and coming challenges from change are markedly different in kind or in degree from those of the past, and whether the resource situation in the party seemed relatively constant. Hegel was clear that philosophy's role was limited to understanding what was already in the process of disappearing, and it was with evident regret that he accepted such impotence. Marx took up the regret and re- jected the acceptance; the point was to change the world. The modern scholar does not typically aspire to change the world; he is often content just to shake that part of it which is made up of his colleagues. (He often gets attached to what he studies and then has to struggle hard to see it straight and whole. Journalists, it is curious to note, seem rather to move towards distaste for their material. Is this because they are given assign- ments, whereas scholars choose subjects?) He knows about self-fulfilling prophecies as well as about the influence of ideas and judgments but does not normally reckon his impact on the object of his attention to be more than marginal. However, he is, perhaps increasingly, concerned to achieve through his understanding more than a picture of a past; if he cannot foretell the future, he hopes to construct a list of the likely, at least of the possible. In that sense the bus is never missed, and every social scientist is a historian with an eye on the future. Studies of Congress published now could not have come very much earlier, and there is no valid purpose for which it can be said that they come too late. Congress is today still with us and needs to be understood; that understanding may in turn affect, if only ever so slightly, the way it changes into tomorrow. The books by Weiner and Kochanek are big, but neither pretends (the titles, as usual, excepted) to be a comprehensive study of the party. For one thing, both concentrate almost wholly on the past twenty years-which means that we still await a decent history of the organisation. That, admittedly, is quite a job, and it is likely that several minds will have to produce separate pieces before any one great and brave man will achieve a sure 200</page><page sequence="3">Congress, Dead or Alive grasp of the whole. But it also means that the reader frequently has a sense of missing a dimension of depth as the threads of I947-67 are un- ravelled and the puzzles explained. To be sure, one must not doubt that our authors are familiar with the outlines of the first sixty years, and it must be conceded that the hackneyed historical introductions so favoured by student theses are not so much inappropriate to social science as merely futile, simply because they are not an integral part of the whole. And yet, counsel of perfection and expression of insolence though this be, history is indeed too important a business to be left to the historians. Admittedly, a line has to be drawn somewhere-for practical and heuristic reasons. But then it has to be rubbed out. It is the rubbing out which could with advantage have been done more thoroughly. Put briefly and in the suitably tentative form of a query, is it not suspect that there should be so little need to appeal to pre-i947 history and does this not exaggerate the break between national movement and political party? It is interesting that Weiner in his fascinating introductory chapter, "The Problem," should touch explicitly on this theme. He discusses as a "popular explanation" of the success of the Congress party the fact that it "bears the legacy of being one of the most successful national movements in the colonial world." He allows that this "has much force" but finds it inadequate. His reasons are three, and each is less than completely clinching. He points out first that there are other nationalist movements that have not been successfully converted; true, but can we not discern in their histories-that of the Muslim League, for instance-just the kinds of deficiencies that explain their subsequent failures? Again, he argues, Congress has been effective in the princely states, areas where it scarcely existed before I947; true, but the leaders in such areas did have some connections with Congress even before I947, and they were surrounded by Congress on all sides and able to learn. Finally, "a generation has passed since indepen- dence" and "for a substantial portion of the party the nationalist era is already history, not memory"; true, but legacies sometimes surely do carry across generations? While allowing from the legacy theme the hang- over of esteem, the headstart of an organisational network, and a reservoir of skills and reputations, Weiner offers alternative hypotheses, all "related to the single theme, that Congress leaders in order to succeed politically are concerned, first and foremost, with doing whatever is necessary to adapt the party to its environment." Whether or not this is, as Weiner says, a "deceptively simple" proposition, it is still puzzling that he should see it as separable from and hostile towards the legacy theme; in reality, only the latter gives it full meaning: to adapt is what Congress has learned, and learning that was part of the legacy. Weiner says his study is "concerned with describing-and therefore explaining- how the party succeeds. It does not ask how the party became what it is-it is therefore not a history." But 20I</page><page sequence="4">Pacific AfFairs the becoming should be integral to any explanation. It is fair enough to avoid pretending to write history, but it is unwise to suggest that useful explanations can be provided without a substantial appeal to history. Aside from history, however, neither work seeks to be comprehensive as analysis of the post-independence Congress. In a way, this is fitting: you can have an all-round study of the Indian Communist party, of Swatantra, or (let us hope, soon) of Jan Sangh, but Congress is a more massive and a more shapeless thing to encompass. It is indeed marvellous how com- plementary the two books turn out to be, almost as if (which is not the case) there had been a planned division of labour. Kochanek focuses on central and state levels, Weiner on the district. There is more to it than that. A political party is an institution which mediates, albeit in a great variety of ways according to type and systems-context, between the producers and consumers of government. Kochanek is most interested in the relations between party and government, Weiner in those between party and publics. This difference in aspect is not identical with the difference in scope, but there is a certain fit between the two. Weiner explains that to study how Con- gress has succeeded means to study how it has recruited members, resolved internal conflict, and won elections. These criteria, especially the first and third, clearly concern the relation of party to publics; on this perfectly legitimate basis, it made sense to focus on the district level. Success could have been defined in terms more connected with the relations to govern- ment; this is indeed what Kochanek does when he speaks of Congress "success in adapting itself to the task of governing," and this warrants his own concentration on the centre and state levels of Congress and the special attention he gives to relations between party and government. The division, of course, cannot be complete; there is a government function of increasing importance at the local level but this is largely ignored by Kochanek, while Weiner in pursuit of "party-building" has to acknowledge that much of this is in fact achieved through the distribution of government benefits. The general argument of Weiner's book has in various ways-including Weiner's own articles-already become familiar. Congress has, in the specific ways mentioned, been a successful party; it has enjoyed several advantages, but it has exploited them well. It has attended to its internal organisation; its local leaders have so related themselves to governmental activity that by the performance of "expediting," "arbitrational," and social service roles they have been able to serve local needs; the party has courted those who have influence, but it has also proved a vehicle for aspiring social groups which have sooner or later been accommodated; it has been able to offer a range of incentives to attract members; hitherto it had managed to resolve or contain most of its internal conflicts. The consequences of such success include the provision of two decades of stable government, a contribution to the task of national integration, and above all the legitimising of the political system through a period of increasing political participation. These 202</page><page sequence="5">Congress, Dead or Alive general conclusions have gained widespread acceptance and are indeed im- portant. But the book is to be praised above all for its vivid and lively presentation of detail from the five selected districts that occupies the bulk of the volume. Attention must also be drawn to the exceptionally useful bibliographical appendices on each district; these indicate the riches which beckon to energetic explorers. Every form of presentation has of course its own problems. On the selection of his districts Weiner is quite clear. This is no pretended sample of the 400 district committees; only five areas are chosen, because on a number of relevant counts they furnish some clearly contrasted settings for the party's work. The difficulty arises rather in the organising of the district data. One might almost say that Weiner has erred on the side of kindness to his readers. The problem is that while the districts have been chosen for their contrasts, there is obviously a great deal in common among them when viewed as areas of party work; yet what a bore it would be to repeat five times the common practices and attitudes found among the Congressmen of the five districts. Weiner's solution is to select for each district a distinct set of themes for examination. Kaira gets the participation crisis, Guntur gets factions and panchayati raj, and so on. Now the alloca- tion of topic to district is not at all arbitrary; if one district has to be the peg on which factions are hung, Guntur looks like the best candidate. But the trouble is that however marked the constrasts are between the districts there is hardly a topic of party problems and party activities that is not present in some degree in all. Weiner spares us the repetition and achieves readability, but at a cost; he leaves us without any direct and careful comparison of particular topics on a cross-district basis: what is there that is similar and what different in the faction set-up in the five areas, and what explanations can be found? It will not do to point to the "Conclusion" and say that the threads are drawn together there. The conclusion is confined to a "highest common factor" treatment. Just because there are, as he says, "some remarkable simi- larities in all the districts," it is true that valid generalisations can be made. But there is still a crucial gap between such generalisations on the one hand and what Weiner rightly calls the "clinical" accounts of the individual districts, "each situation in its entirety." What is missing is the tough job of comparative analysis. Weiner himself sees this in a limited sense when he says: "To each generalization we could of course add qualifications, or we could show the variations from one district organization to another." But this-which would at least take us some way towards a dynamic and ex- planatory view of process-he astonishingly leaves "to those readers who have diligently read the preceding chapters." This is to carry the principle of division of labour too far; the work could have been done most economi- cally and most surely by the investigator who studied the clinical data at first hand. 203</page><page sequence="6">Pacific Affairs The point being made here has special significance in relation to at- tempts to understand the present position of Congress. Weiner's work relates mainly, as he says, to i96i-63 when he did his field investigations. These were still Nehru's days, and i967 was a long way ahead. Although the author makes an effort to take the fourth elections into account, he could not rewrite in such a way as to revise the perspective. It is with the benefit of hindsight of course that we can now say: you showed us the general bases of Congress success and its detailed manifestations, but if in addition you had analysed why the party was relatively more successful here, rel- atively less successful there, then we would have been greatly helped in our understanding of the nature of the i967 relative failure. The defect in most commentaries on the i967 elections and their aftermath of defections is that they supply merely general reasons for what was not a general phenomenon. In some states there was virtually no loss of vote-share, in some there were no defections (or only defections to Congress). Why? Do we really understand what causes rainfall if we cannot explain why it is higher in one place than another? Congress failures (like earlier Congress successes) are not uniform; to account for the variations would be to account for everything. This is not quite achieved either by a very general formula, such as "success varies directly with adaptability to environment," or by separated clinical descriptions, but only by comparative analysis. As already indicated, Kochanek's whole focus is different: he is looking at the party's organisational problems, mainly as they appear at centre and state levels. His approach is not clinical but historical: he examines the party's management of its affairs and in particular of party-government relations and finds that the story since I946 falls into three phases. From I946 to i95i there is a most awkward period of transition as the rules and conduct of a national movement are pressed into new shape to fit a party in power. The period of centralisation and "convergence" (i.e. of party and government) is the period of Nehru command and lasts until i963 when the party enters a phase of "divergence" and federalisation. The labels for the periods sound crude, but the exposition is detailed and sensitive; Kochanek sees that there were limits to centralisation and convergence even in the golden fifties, just as there are limits now to divergence and devolution. The two issues, relations of party organisations to government and distribu- tion of power through the party structure, are examined through a number of topics: the relations of the offices of prime minister and Congress president, the composition and behaviour of the Working Committee, its role in relation to other party organs, centre-state relations and ministries, the working of the Parliamentary Board on matters like ministry-formation, the operation of the Central Election Committee in the task of candidate- selection. There is a great deal of repetition in the book, but it goes thor- oughly about its task and makes intelligent use of interesting unpublished 204</page><page sequence="7">Congress, Dead or Alive private papers. A smaller portion of the book is on a slightly different theme, the changing social composition of the party. Some of the data here are drawn from other studies, but the major part has been dug out of special surveys and Who's Whos. Allowing for all the difficulties in interpreting such categories as occupations, there is no doubt that the picture supports Weiner's theme of Congress adaptability to environment. Although Kochanek's main work in India was done even earlier than that which went into the Weiner book, it went to press later and could build on Weiner's work; moreover, Kochanek had the opportunity to spend time in India during and after the i967 elections. He therefore confronts more explicitly and at greater length (in a postscript chapter) the puzzles of the present. He does so with admirable balance of judgment. He draws attention to some important and not so obvious causes of Congress failure. For instance, he shows how the crippling defections in some states were in part the consequence of ruthless (or desperate) monopolising steps taken by chief ministers against dissidents, steps which in earlier years they would have been prevented from taking by central organs such as the Central Election Committee; this kind of central weakness he connects in turn with squabbles and distrust in Delhi, which proves no longer able to protect the minority factions. However, to return to our complaint, it cannot be said that Kochanek, any more than Weiner, really tells us why Congress difficulties are uneven, why electoral reverses were so much more marked in some areas than in others, why defections are also unevenly distributed (and not quite in step with the areas of electoral defeats). Why does the adaptability trick fail? To put two possibilities in all too crude terms, is it that some environments were unpropitious for Congress skills, or is the explanation to be sought rather in party deficiencies which are more marked in some states than in others? In what is almost an aside, Kochanek suggests a preference for the latter line when he remarks that internal incoherence is more marked in northern states where change in the Congress elite has been slower than in the south. But it would be inappropriate and unrepresentative of one's view to conclude on a note of complaint. What needs to be said is that we shall never understand Indian politics unless we understand Congress and that now we can no longer say that we have no major studies of this extraordinary party. Weiner and Kochanek have done great work; more clearly than before we can see how much there is to do. Congress is dead? These two have made it alive. Institute of Commonwealth Studies, W. H.
