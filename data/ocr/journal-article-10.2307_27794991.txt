<plain_text><page sequence="1">689 Book Reviews Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy Nicholas Rescher Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996 ix + 213 pp. I As the subtitle indicates, Nicholas Reseller's aim in this readable and rewarding book is to provide a "conveniently synoptic, compact, and accessible exposition" of process philosophy (p.l ). However, by 'process philosophy' he does not mean "the doctrines of Alfred North Whitehead" (p.8). Instead, the term refers to a broad "philosophical movement" (p.3), founded by Heraclitus, and including, for example, Leibniz, Hegel, and, as readers of this journal might suspect, Peirce. Hence, understood so broadly, process philosophy does not consist in a definite set of doctrines, but instead is "something rather sche matic" (p.8), a "doctrinal tendency" (pp.9,32), a "general line of approach" (p.2) to philosophical issues. Although the first chapter (entitled "Historical Background") contains a quick survey of the history of process philosophy, Rescher's book is not a work of history, nor does it focus on the writings of any process philosopher. Instead, his aim is achieved, he announces in his "Introduction", by synthesizing a variety of different and sometimes divergent-seeming doctrinal positions into a unified construct that harmonizes with the views that are typical of or pre dominate in this philosophical tradition, (p.4) And, in an endnote to this remark, he adds that his book "does not even represent, always and everywhere, the personal position of the author" (p.183 [note 2]). However, it still "reflects a longstanding interest in process philosophy" (p.ix). Written clearly and interestingly, the book is quite suitable for undergraduate courses, but it also can be read with profit by those who have considerable knowledge of its subject. For it seeks "to</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 690 substantiate and illustrate the utility and feasibility of the process ap proach in philosophy" (p. 170). Accordingly, it discusses, in a series of chapters, the process approach to particulars (Ch. 3), universals (Ch. 4), nature (Ch. 5), persons (Ch. 6), logic and epistemology (Ch. 7), scientific enquiry (Ch. 8), theology (Ch. 9), metaphilosophy (Ch. 10), and semantics (the Appendix). Thus it is not merely an introduction to but also a work in process philosophy, one that makes some worthwhile and original contributions. II Having summarized Reseller's aim, I want now to discuss his second chapter, "Basic Ideas". In so doing, I shall test some of his claims there by means of comparisons with the version of process philosophy found in Whitehead's Process and Reality. In that chapter, Rescher makes claims about the idea of process that are schematic, claims that are intended to be typical of process philosophies generally. In contrast, Whitehead developed a concep tion of process in terms of an elaborate system of categories (PR 20-28)} There is room in process philosophy for both sorts of effort; and those who have not attempted Whitehead would be well-advised to read Rescher first. However, if Rescher's purpose is to make claims about the idea of process that fit the widest imaginable range of process philoso phies, he sometimes would appear not to be general enough. For instance, one of his claims is that a process has stages that are in a "series" (p. 38), or "successive" (p. 39), or in "sequence" (p. 41 ). It seems to me that a reader might reasonably assume that what he means by this claim is that the stages of a process are ordered linearly. (Roughly speaking, any two distinct members Xand of a linear order are such that either Xprecedes Tor Tprecedes X.) To picture this notion of linear order, recall that epigram of process philosophy, Heraclitus's famous fragment, "One cannot step twice into the same river" (p. 9). Then note that, standing on a riverbank, you see the water flow past you successively. But the stages of a process might instead be partially ordered.</page><page sequence="3">691 Book Reviews (Again speaking roughly, there can be two distinct members of a par tial order such that neither precedes the other.2 ) To picture this notion of partial order, imagine a river with branching tributaries. Then note that, when you stand between two tributaries, the water flowing past you in one of them is neither upstream from nor down stream from the water flowing past you in the other. This schematic conception of a partially ordered process should not be dismissed as a merely fanciful alternative, for it is realized in Whitehead's metaphys ics: In particular, because contemporaneous actual occasions do not prehend each other, actual occasions are only partially ordered (by the relation of prehension).3 (On the other hand, the phases of an actual occasion's internal process of concrescence are linearly ordered.) The point is that, in order to have a sufficiently general idea of the stages of a process, there is need for a conception of order that is sufficiently general. Because of its many schematic claims about the idea of process, Rescher's book gives the impression that in process philosophy that particular idea is the one that is fundamental. Consider, for instance, another claim in the second chapter, namely, that "processes are more fundamental than things" (p.28). But a process philosophy might have more than one fundamental idea. For example, among the many categories of Whitehead's metaphysics is a "principle of process" (PR 23) (as well as other categories containing the term 'process'). But there also is a "principle of relativity" (PR 22) (along with other categories that are concerned with interrelatedness.) Accordingly, my view is that also fundamental to Whitehead's process philosophy is the idea of relation. Thus Whitehead's version of the above claim is better expressed as follows: Interrelated processes are more funda mental than things with properties. In short, a process philosophy might also be a relation philosophy.4 In light of my contention that a process philosophy might have as fundamental ideas both that of process and that of relation, let us consider another claim made in Rescher's second chapter about the idea of process: The stages of a process are not arbitrarily juxtaposed, not "unconnected" (p.39), but instead are "connected" (p.38),</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 692 "united" (p.39); and, moreover, this connecting or uniting is by means of a "program" (pp.38,41) (or rule). Thus "the unity of a process is the unity of a lawful order" (p. 39). Analogously, there are "ordering principles" that connect together meaningfully "the letters of a word or the words of a sentence" (p. 39). But this claim too might not be general enough. For, instead of being connected by a program (or rule or law or principle), the stages of a process might be connected by means of relationships that they have with one another, relationships that are concrete and particular. For instance, the stages of the process of falling in love that happens between Romeo and Juliet would not seem to be regulated by any program (or rule or law or principle). Instead, the process whereby they fall in love would seem to involve a succession of relationships, relationships that are concrete and particular, as each beholds the other, as each speaks to the other, as each touches the other, and so forth. Also, when a person engages in a process of thinking, and does so creatively, a novel thought might emerge from preceding thoughts, but not by means of a program (or rule or law or principle). Never theless, the novel thought is internally related to the preceding thoughts, for it would not be what it is without them. Moreover, there might be processes that are random or disordered, and yet later stages might emerge from earlier ones by means of relationships that are concrete and particular. Note that, in Whitehead's metaphysics, actual occasions are interrelated by means of their prehensions of one another. And prehensions are "Concrete Facts of Relatedness" (PR 22). Some of Reseller's claims about the idea of process might not be sufficiently general, or so I have been arguing. But Rescher himself levels this sort of charge against those who would "model" their idea of process on "human experience" (p.43). "For all experience is owned: every experience is somebody's experience" (p.43). Accord ingly, instead of the limited claim that all processes are owned, he supports the more general claim that processes can be both "owned and unowned" (p.42). Hence "a plausible processism need not nec essarily be anthropomorphic" (p.43). He would seem to interpret</page><page sequence="5">693 Book Reviews Whitehead as a process philosopher who is thus anthropomorphic, because Whitehead based his conception of actual occasions on hu man experience (p.43). However, Whitehead's metaphysics also in volves processes that are unowned, for instance, a succession of dura tions (PR 124-126). I stated earlier that Rescher's book is not just an accessible introduction but also a work that makes significant con tributions. One such contribution is his discussion of unowned pro cesses. /// I have been examining some of Rescher's claims about the idea of process in his second chapter. I would like now to comment on a few of the many topics which he discusses in the remaining chapters. In doing this, I shall continue to test some of his claims about the idea of process by means of comparisons with Whitehead's meta physics. In the third chapter, "Process and Particulars", he claims that some processes are "concrete particulars" (p.51). For instance, not only can "physical objects" and the "substances" of "traditional meta physics" be construed as process particulars, but also "rainstorms" and "performances of a symphony" (p. 52). Furthermore, these "pro cess particulars are systemic wholes comprised of subordinate pro cesses" (p.55).5 Thus a process particular consists of component processes that "combine" or "unite" or "join" together to constitute it(p.54). This unity (or combination or junction) of component processes in a process particular is a "functional unity" (pp.52,53). Although he does not say this, I would assume that the functional unity of component processes is provided by a program (or rule or law or principle). Accordingly, the following would appear to be an ex ample: The process of performing a string quartet consists of the component processes of playing the first violin, playing the second violin, playing the viola, and playing the cello; and the functional unity is provided (at least in part) by the score. (Similarly, the unity of a rainstorm might be provided by laws of nature.) But such a claim about the functional unity of component pro</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 694 cesses might not be general enough. For, instead of (or in addition to) having the functional unity of a program (or rule or law or prin ciple), component processes might unite (or combine or join) to gether through their concrete and particular interrelationships. For example, in performing a string quartet, the violinists, violisi, and cellist sit facing each other, and each responds to how the others are performing. Hence, in addition to the unity provided by the score, there is a unity provided by their relationships with one another, rela tionships that are concrete and particular. A second example can be found in Whitehead's metaphysics: Musical performances are process particulars, and so are physical ob jects. Thus Whitehead held that a physical object is a society of actual occasions (PR 35). Moreover, the component actual occasions in a society unite together by means of something like a program (or rule or law or principle), for they have in common what he termed a "de fining characteristic" (i.e., an eternal object) (PR 34). But the com ponent actual occasions in a society also unite together by means of their prehensions of one another, that is, they also are concretely and particularly interrelated (PR 34). In the fourth chapter, "Process and Universals", Rescher claims that universals are "structural features of processes" (p.73). More over, such structural features are "programmatic" (pp.74,189 [note 2]). Hence this way of understanding universals would also seem to be grounded on his claim that the stages of a process are connected by means of a program (or rule or law or principle). And it would also seem to reflect his claim that there can be processes that are unowned. For a process does not have to be owned, it does not have to have a subject, in order to have a programmatic structure. He mentions "two sorts" of universals: "perceptual universals" and "natural kinds" (p.69). But there could also be a third sort, namely, what might be termed 'values' (e.g., Plato's form of justice). However, instead of being a structural feature of a process, a value can unite a process by serving as its goal. For instance, the members of a string quartet might have as their common goal performing a work beautifully (or euphoniously or authentically). Also, in</page><page sequence="7">695 Book Reviews Whitehead's metaphysics, the subjective aim of an actual occasion involves contrasts of eternal objects (i.e., universals) (PR 277-278). In short, in addition to being structural features of processes, univer sals might also be (features of) goals of processes. That is, to borrow Aristotle's terms, universals might function both as formal causes and as final causes.6 In the appendix, "Process Semantics", Rescher contributes in terestingly to process philosophy, by briefly sketching a nonstandard semantics for formal logic, one that arguably avoids certain problems that have "long troubled subject-predicate theorists" (p. 175). In so doing, he claims that a "physical process" is "particularized" by its location in space and time (p. 178). Accordingly, there is both "an array of [types or sorts of] processes" (with variables ranging over them) and a "set of positions" (with variables ranging over them) (p.181). For instance, "f-at-p" indicates "that the [type or sort of] process / is realized at the position p" (p.182).7 Hence this claim that physical processes are particularized by their space-time loca tions suggests that space-time is a sort of container for them. However, in his fifth chapter, "Process Philosophy of Nature", he asserts that space-time is not a "container" for processes (p.95). For he claims there that space-time should instead be understood "as itself an aspect of natural process, as a resultant part of the natural interrelatedness of such processes" (p.95). But this last claim would seem to imply that the set of positions is derivative from the set of process particulars. Accordingly, instead of having variables that range over positions, it might be better, in devising a process semantics for formal logic, to have variables that range over process particulars. I have been maintaining that a process philosophy might also be a relation philosophy. But it is not clear how the idea of relation fares in Rescher's process semantics. Consider, in particular, the following key passage (p. 178): In general, a process semantics should . . . accomplish with verbs and adverbs whatever a semantics of individuals can manage to do with properties and relations. . . . (Thus, "X</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews 696 is triangular" becomes "X disports itself triangularly." And . . . "X is north-of-T" becomes "X locates itself to-the-north-of-T-ly.")8 The last sentence in this passage suggests that relations can be reduced to relational properties. For "Xis north-of-T" would ap pear to mean that the one-place relational property "being-to-the-north-of-T" holds of X. Analogously, the sentence suggests that verbs that have two or more subjects can be reduced to verbs that have one subject. For "Xlocates itself to-the-north-of-T-ly" would appear to mean that the one-subject verb "locates itself to-the-north-of-T-ly" holds of X. However, it is questionable whether relations are reducible to re lational properties. Similarly, it should be questionable whether verbs with two or more subjects are reducible to verbs with one subject. Accordingly, my view is that the last sentence in the above passage should be followed by something like this sentence: And "X is north of T" becomes "Xlocates itself northly of T." Here "Xis north of T' means that the relation "is north of holds between Xand T, and "X locates itself northly of T" means that the two-subject verb "locates itself northly of" holds between Xand T. Note, finally, that what I am calling a two-subject verb just is a sort of two-termed relation. IV Having commented on a few of the many topics in Reseller's book, I shall close by listing some of the others: Strawson's criticism of process philosophy (pp.60-64), novelty and creativity (pp.74-78), laws of nature construed as "pervasive processes" (p.92), teleology and evolution (pp.99-102), mind and body (pp.112-116), future contingencies and truth-value indeterminacy (pp. 126-129), and the activity of philosophizing itself construed as a process (pp. 170-172). In conclusion, by providing cogent and interesting discussions of a wide range of topics, Rescher's book succeeds in conveying to the reader the significance and importance of the process approach in philosophy.</page><page sequence="9">697 Book Reviews Hunter College of the City University of New York John W. Lango NOTES 1. References of this form are to Alfred North Whitehead, Pro cess and Reality, Corrected Edition, edited by David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne (New York and London: The Free Press, 1978). 2. Concerning the distinction between a linear order and a par tial order, see Rudolf Carnap's Introduction to Symbolic Logic and Its Applica tions (NewYork: Dover Publications, 1958), pp. 122-123. 3. Note Whitehead's remark that "the term Creative advance' [of actual occasions] is not to be construed in the sense of a uniquely serial [i.e., linear] advance" (PR 35). 4. I do not mean to suggest that Rescher ignores entirely the idea of relation. In particular, in discussing the topic of substance, he asserts that "processes are, by their very nature, interrelated" (p. 48). Nevertheless, from his scattered remarks involving the idea of relation, his conception of its role in process philosophy is not made very clear. Such remarks occur on pp. 46, 56, 80, 94-96, 103, 110, 129, and 180. 5. Rescher interprets Whitehead as a "process atomist", because actual occasions are "irreducibly atomic units of process" (p. 89). In contrast, he prefers a process philosophy that allows "decomposition into ever-smaller processual units" (p. 90). However, an actual occasion can (in a sense) be divided into "component" prehensions (PR 283), and each such prehension is itself a process (PR 219). 6. Elsewhere Rescher would seem to allow a place for final cau sation. Consider, in particular, the following remark: "Physical processes al ways possess some element of self-propulsion" (p. 85). Also, see his discussion of evolution and teleology (pp. 99-100). 7. I am assuming, in making the insertions in brackets, that the variable "/" ranges over types or sorts of processes. This assumption seems to be confirmed especially by the first paragraph on p. 178. 8. I have corrected a misprint by adding the last quotation mark.</page></plain_text>
