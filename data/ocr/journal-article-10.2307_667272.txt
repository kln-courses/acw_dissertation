<plain_text><page sequence="1">[65, 1963] 144 American Anthropologist In Europe, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Austria, great attention is being given to these and related problems. Two of the papers deal with the problem in North American Indian cultures, which Hultkrantz feels is a field particularly rich and varied, fairly untouched by the cross currents of ideas from higher cultures but with existing conditions of culture and nature which are very distinct. Gosta Kock also touches on the problem among the North American Indians, reflecting upon the influ- ence of the missionary. This volume presents a challenge to and provides an inspiration for folklorists and ethnologists of other parts of the world who might do well to look into this heretofore neglected problem. Loki in Scandinavian Mythology. ANNA BIRGITTA ROOTH. (Reg. Societatis Humaniorum Litterarum Lundensis, Skrifter utgivna av Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskapssam- fundet i Lund, 61.) Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, Publishers, 1961. xv, 266 pp., bibli- ography. Kr 30:-. Reviewed by SVEN LILJEBLAD, Idaho State College There can be little doubt that this iconoclastic portraying of an enigmatic figure in the Scandinavian pantheon brings a much discussed problem to a definite conclusion. So far, Loki has eluded the inquiry of the mythologists, notwithstanding an imposing series of monographic works, notably those by A. Olrik, H. Celander, J. de Vries, E. J. Gras, G. Dumezil, and F. Strom. Concepts of Loki's personality held by these writers are strikingly dissenting. With eclectic freedom toward a heterogeneous material and stressing his evil character, most investigators have interpreted Loki as a god of death, cold, and darkness, an enemy of the Asa gods, or as the faithless follower of Othin and Thor. Others have traced his origin to that of a fire demon or a water spirit. Still another type of investigation has emphasized his character of a trickster, a culture hero, or an ancestor of demons. Common to these authorities was the concept of the myths as sources of religious belief and practice. Dr. Rooth treats the twelve myths in which Loki appears as products of a learned literary tradition. She begins by examining each one of them in relation to contempo- rary narrative material with general European distribution. The myths are embodied in prose and verse redactions none of which antedates the 9th century. Records as known to us were made in the 13th and 14th centuries by Icelandic mythographers familiar with the literature of the Middle Ages. For the most part, these myths are based on tales, anecdotes, medieval hero tales, and clerical writings, largely transmitted through intermediary Irish and Anglo-Saxon sources during a period (from the 8th to the 13th century) when the British Isles exerted a strong cultural influence on Scandinavia. The small residue of mythological traits which remains after all the international material is sifted out are the only ones which can reasonably be Scandinavian and constitutive of the original Loki figure. The author finds that stories about Loki as the inventor of the net, by means of which he is caught himself, form the core of this authentic remainder. She traces these narratives to a well-known Scandinavian-Finnish aetiological myth of the first net. Pointing to the facts that Loki and Locke are used synonymously in 16th- century ballad tradition, that locke in medieval Swedish means 'spider' (the only known meaning of the word), and that Locke in sayings and proverbs occurs both as an anthro- pomorphic being and as a spider, the author concludes that Loki originally was the spider-trickster. She supports her conclusion by referring to parallels in non-European cultures. Other characteristics of Loki as pictured in the Old Norse myths are cunning and duplicity but also foolishness and his alternant theriomorphic and anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 145 shape (mare, fly, bird, fish, old woman), features which Dr. Rooth attributes to plots inherent in the secondarily added tales. However, Loki's provocative character would seem to agree with his role as a trickster, an idea called to notice by de Vries. Beside Loki's invention of the net and his function as a "catcher," his and Othin's sworn brotherhood and his companionship with Thor are the only features of a mythological order which are authentically Scandinavian, although the two latter motifs are not to be found in the modern material. The author feels that these traits are inconsistent; but they do not seem inconsistent with her final conclusion that Loki is a trickster, since the right place of a trickster ought to be at the elbow of a venerable companion. Thus, Dr. Rooth has explained most convincingly why, of all the Asa gods, just Loki played the double role of a mischief-maker and a provider, and why he was the only one to retain a deep-rooted existence in popular tradition up to this day. But the book also has a methodological consequence. The author proves in her own work the superiority of a comparative approach to the study of the mythological tale. She argues that merely interpretative studies fail to account for the epic course of events and favor theoretical speculation. It is not the character that forms the stories; it is the association of stories secondarily attributed to a character that creates traditional humorous cycles. In illus- tration of her thesis, the author adds some interestine observations concerning the clustering of anecdotal material around historical and fictitious titles. This profound and technically skillful treatise would have gained by editorial prun- ing. The author's desire to make her conclusions perfectly clear has caused redundancies and unnecessary repetitions which make the lack of an index doubly inconvenient. Primitive Scandinavian Textiles in Knotless Netting. ODD NORDLAND. (Studia Norvegica No. 10.) Oslo: Oslo University Press, 1961. 154 pp., bibliography, 1 chart, 83 figures, footnotes. 18/6. Reviewed by A. H. GAYTON, University of California (Berkeley) For those concerned with cultural processes as expressed in the concrete evidence of things and the interpretation of such evidence, this is an important study. The booklet's restricted title suggests something for specialists concerned only with "less and less." It does begin with the "less"-a typological treatment of knotless netting variations which makes rather sticky reading even for the specialist. But it soon expands to "more"-the significance of the types in terms of processual developments, their occur- rence from antiquity to the present, and the cultural implications of the changes in types, materials, and usages. The focus is on knotless netting as found in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Comparisons with other areas, especially native America, suggest broader theoretical and historical interpretations. Techniques per se are interesting by their relevance to culture history. Those of knotless netting are in need of attention because of their extreme antiquity and ubiq- uity, certainly Neolithic in their simplest forms, and pre-dating cloth weaving. Yet knotless netting has been ignored save for a few studies, notably those by D. S. David- son (AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST 37:117-134, 1935) and Margrethe Hald (Olddanske Tekstiler, Copenhagen, 1950). The basic technique is essentially one of looping a single strand of yarn upon itself. Variations range from simple types for which no tool is neces- sary, to more intricate coilings requiring only a coarse needle or bodkin. Whether simple or complex, the construction methods are particularly suitable for three-dimensional objects, e.g., conical or bag shapes, caps, mittens, leggings, and stockings. This applica- bility has made knotless netting persist for centuries in archaic, primitive, peasant, and folk cultures. Now declining in popularity, it remains in the Scandinavian folk scene (especially Finland) chiefly for hand and foot gear.</page></plain_text>
