The purpose is to show how the discourse of philosophy of religion came about in Lithuania. This branch of philosophy has been not only culturally and socially important in Lithuania, it has been significant as well for the formation and maintenance of national identity. By the same token, it also was the most developed and controversial theoretically. The first part of the article lays out the genesis of the autonomous Lithuanian philosophy of religion, though strongly influenced by the transformations in the broader context of European philosophy. For that reason it will be useful to present the ideas of the most prominent Lithuanian thinkers in the field who have successfully adopted and adapted vital trends in Western philosophy into the Lithuanian cultural and intellectual context. The second part of the article is less historical and more problematic as it deals with specific issues concerning faith, God, anthropological problems as reflected in the works of contemporary Lithuanian philosophers of religion. Only after having explored certain affiliations of Lithuanian philosophy of religion with Western thought can we state that, although the latter was the necessary precondition of the former, Lithuanian philosophy of religion does substantiate its sovereign status while correlating in an original way major cultural transformations with the changes in theoretical context, according to the specific concerns of Lithuanian society. In addition, this historical and philosophical examination aims to look at the formation of Lithuanian identity, mentality, values, their roots in the Christian tradition as well as the capacity to respond at critical historical moments.

Bnedis The historical context of Lithuanian philosophy of religion From the very beginning, in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Lithuanian philosophy was firmly rooted and constantly influenced by major developments and transformations in the common European philosophical tradition. Alongside general philosophical problems in epistemology, ontology, cosmology, and anthropology, to more concrete ethical, social, political considerations, one of the most vital was the question of religion. Firstly, because philosophy at that time was institutional, that is Christian in its Catholic and Protestant modes, and was developed in schools under the administration of Catholic abbeys or reformed communities. Meanwhile, the representatives of renaissance humanism - publicists, historians, and literary men - were active in manor houses and state administration. Lithuania, as many other countries of that time, was multinational. The first philosophers in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL) were, beside Lithuanians, Germans and Poles, all of whom had a common base for philosophical endeavor - the Latin language. Lithuanian philosophy in its first stage also had an educational character which means that the biggest part of the philosophical heritage consists in manuscripts of lectures in philosophy. On the other hand, many Lithuanians worked as lecturers in nearby countries. The first works in the philosophy of religion were published by theoreticians of the Lithuanian reformation; therefore the first stage of the philosophy of religion in Lithuania was under the heavy influence of the Reformation. A major answer to the spread of protestant philosophy in Lithuania from the Catholic side was the foundation of Vilnius University in 1579 under the guidance of the Jesuits. This strategy strengthened the position of scholastic philosophy, at the time the "official" philosophy in Europe, with professional disciples in Lithuania. It was inseparable from studies in logic (Smigleckis 1562-1618). European philosophy, with its eurocentrism and logocentrism, was adopted within Lithuanian culture following the christening of the nation, which was first of all a political-cultural act. Values of ancient pagan Lithuanian culture, including its religion, myths, worldview, and morality were displaced step by step by the common values of European culture. With the enormous spread of military influence in the 15th century the Vatican and Rome hoped in the face of Lithuania to expand Catholicism to the east. These military and political factors were accompanied by cultural changes, emigration and immigration, building churches and scriptoriums. On the other hand, the formation of Christian culture and reception of Christian philosophical reflection in 15th century Lithuania were rudimentary. All the power of the new church was directed to battling the pagans. These were hardly conditions in which philosophy, theology, and other domains of thought could thrive. However, at that time the notion of Lithuanian identity had already been formulated, including reflection on such notions as territory, origins, history, and language. Those notions were present in the correspondence of Lithuanian rulers to the Roman Pope regarding the question of the integrity of the land, the status of its independence. Here, Christian culture and the vital need for sophisticated understanding of Lithuanian identity were developed; statehood and nationhood went hand in hand. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="3">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 17 The first schools in the main city and capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, already included the disciplines of philosophy and theology under the patronage of the Dominican order. Eventually professional philosophy in Lithuania was born from the scholastic methods and questions of medieval European philosophy. It is worth mentioning that the general situation of scholastic philosophy was already problematic all over Europe, and we lack clear evidence as to how Lithuanian thinkers of the time approached the major problems of philosophy and theology, e.g. in accordance with the via moderna, which sought new ways of approaching the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, or the via antique, the proponents of which held that the real content of philosophy is already known and only minor corrections are needed. Hence the Dominicans brought philosophy to Lithuania around 1507, at the dusk of medieval worldview and the dawn of humanism. The ideas of the Renaissance reached Lithuania from the University of Prague. Hieronymus Pragensis, one of the closest colleagues of Jan Hus, spent a year in Lithuania where he spread ideas about the real nature of the Church which cannot be identified with the "visible" church. Students from Lithuania absorbed radical (for the Catholic Church) ideas of the Renaissance from the best universities of Italy, Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland where Lutheran and Calvinist anthropology was rising. Besides being a religious movement in Lithuania, the Reform was understood as the kairos (right time) to form society anew. The main goal of the reception of the ideas of Humanism, the Reformation, and Protestantism was the synthesis of scientific and philosophical innovations and the needs of society and the person. Therefore, there are no "theoretical" texts in the philosophy of religion from this period, and the only works that could be labeled as "works in the philosophy of religion" usually were well-stated instigations for a moral rebirth in the light of reformed Christianity, sometimes even written as social Utopias. It is important to note that despite religious overtones Lithuanian reformers (and some modern Catholics as well) formulated their ideas in secular terms. More theoretical reflections were addressed to questions of philosophical anthropology following the crisis of dualist medieval anthropology. In place of this dualism, the humanists turned to the anthropocentric philosophy of St. Augustine, to his existential dramatism, formulating it as dramatic confrontation of vetus homo and novus homo. However, the objectivistic and rigorist anthropology of Thomas Aquinas, with its topology of the human being within the objective ontic hierarchy of the world, was never entirely forgotten. The Lithuanian reformers secularized anthropological issues so far as possible within the intellectual climate of the time. One of the prominent Lithuanian protestant thinkers Andrius Volanas (1530-1610) approached human nature rationally. He argued that moral duties should be deduced from human nature directly, not from the divine law, although human nature is rooted in lex aeterna. This deduction must be seen in the light of Aristotle's and Cicero's doctrines. He and other reformers rethought hierarchical strategies of salvation and society held by Catholics, denied the collective notion of human value, according to which a person is of worth because of her reliance on a certain caste or humanity as a whole. They stated that the human being must be rather evaluated according to the individualist, elitist canons of antiquity. While pointing to the context of Lithuanian £) Springer</page><page sequence="4">18 M. Briedis history, Volanas describes the true personality as a cultural hero, and the strength of Lithuanian rulers is identified with the power of Christianity. Even geographical discoveries are understood as the expressions of human power. Such a notion of a person is in opposition to scholastic dualism, because it opens up the possibility to free the individual from the inborn social and even natural a priori orders. The other prominent thinker Augustinas Rotundas (1520-1584) argued that while expanding his creative powers man not only humanizes nature but also recreates himself. This was a new look at the problem of the factual state of human nature, that is, its being in the world foremostly for the nation and the state. Therefore, in Lithuanian philosophy of the 16th century, along with the humanistic interpretation of religion, ethno-cultural and civic characteristics of persons were regarded as a priori values. As elsewhere in Europe, Lithuanian reformers sought to free politics from theology, tried to replace the mediating character of liturgical regulation with a direct relation between an individual and God. While the Reformation began with religious issues, it came with time to have sociopolitical consequences, and only three years after Luther nailed his theses to the doors of the Cathedral in Wittenberg the Reformation was officially prohibited by Zygimantas' Old edict. Hence many noble families (Chodkeviciai, Kiskiai, Radvilos, Tiskeviciai) supported the ideas of the Reformation. But the Reformation in Lithuania was as heterogeneous as that elsewhere in Europe. A clear example of this was the disagreement about the interpretation of Trinitarian dogma that brought the Lithuanian Marians (the most radical reformers) to separate irreparably from the Calvinists. Hence, in general the reformers were organized and were the first to exploit new tools for propaganda (as Luther did), in particular the invention of printing. Besides this, the reformers had a well-organized educational system. In 1540 Abraomas Kulvietis (1510-1545) founded a school in Vilnius which in 1592 became a gymnasium (Gymanasium Vilnensis). The educational program was based on philosophy and Protestant theology. How should we characterize the reception of Protestant ideas and the ideas of the Reformation in general in Lithuania? Luther and other prominent reformers denied "divine" powers of human rationality as well as the concept of the world as a potentially cognizable order. The deconstruction of this correlation between subjective and objective reason gives us a unique understanding of faith, which in the wake of Aristotelian-Aquinian scholasticism returned to Augustine, German mysticism, late nominalism with its introspection, the power of intuition, raising individuality over abstraction. Hence the theological content of the Reformation upstaged philosophical reflection. Radical Lutheran anthropology even treated philosophical efforts as a part of fallible human nature. The goal of all human speculation must be not to validate its existence but to submit it to a radical doubt while observing human weakness. The sphere of faith is radically different from various discursive practices. The real value of faith is not some kind of Gnostic systematic knowledge, but action which leads to a new being, spiritual renovation in the love and grace of God. This can be realized only through Christianity in the depths of the individual, in the whole of its concreteness and subjectivity. Theoretically, the dominant branch of Protestantism in Lithuania was Calvinism. Along with social reforms the ideas of Calvinism were accepted in Lithuania as an £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 1 9 instrument for shaping a strong willed, disciplined person, who seeks salvation through care and respect for the others as well as positive contribution to the shaping of social conscience and the constructive support of state institutions. This amalgam of social activity and Calvinist theology [formulated first of all by Adomas Rasijus (1560-1628)] in Lithuania mirrored the Melancthian synthesis of Aristotelian politics and ethics with Calvinism in a broader sense. But the core of the philosophy of religion remained the question concerning the status of ratio and its functionality in the phenomenon of faith; in other words, it is the role and cognitive status of epistemological methods regarding metaphysical sphere. Speaking about confessions, this same problem turns out to be the deep doubt about the truths approved by the Catholic Church. Incidentally, these processes were fostered by the spread of Bible translations into the national languages (in Lithuania it was the Polish translation). The most active theoreticians of that time in Lithuania were the Marians who advocated a "new rationality" beyond the clash of scholastic rationality and Augustinian introspection. This new approach acknowledges the natural ability of man to comprehend divine truth without additional discourse. Florijonas Crusius, an Arian from Plunge, who corresponded with Kepler and admired his system of the motion of celestial bodies, and his friend and translator Simonas Budnas (1530- 1593) also viewed scripture from a logical perspective. Some Lithuanian theoreticians (for example, Licinius Namyslovius) were the followers of the Italian Arian, Socino, who taught that religion is a moral doctrine according to which salvation is the consequence of righteous living. This certainly was a revival of Pelagianism that had been denounced as heresy during the patristic period. The most prominent Protestant philosophers in Lithuania at that time were Baltazaras Krosnevicius and Rasijus. Krosnevicius was called a "Protestant Aristotelian from Vilnius." His thesis (defended in Germany) affirmed that the intellect knows only what is sensual, but sensual data include many fleeting aspects, therefore abstraction is necessary. Eventually he resolved the problem of universals in re (interestingly enough, Protestants typically avoided this major scholastic problem). Rasijus constructed his metaphysics on the ideas of Suarez's analysis of truth arguing that in a metaphysical sense truth is independent of one's judgment, but ethically it is as inconsistent as virtue, which can be gained and lost. The crucial novelty of Rasijus work is the synthesis of Protestant metaphysics with Catholic scholastic metaphysics in the question of ontic truth. The most prominent advocates of the Lutheran understanding of justification, according to which faith is meaningful only through an extraordinary metaphysical act - the absolute surrender of the individual in the face of absolute - were Kulvietis and Volanas. In the late 16th and the early 17th centuries they combined protestant thought with Augustinian ideas. Rewards for good deeds are meaningless and the only value of human life and being is all-embracing faith, which is the mother lode of all good deeds. Volanas even detected traces of hedonism in Catholic representations of faith and liturgical practices, e.g. in church aesthetics and liturgical ethics. Lithuanian reformers thought of feelings and subjective states in the broader sense as having a cognitive status. And this brought with it a subjective, interior £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">20 M. Briedis approach to faith. The religious community should encourage, not control these efforts.. Later propositions such as these were sustained by the Kantian reversal of the Bible and morality, which even without deducing God, though necessarily postulating basic features of spiritual reality, lead to religion. Lithuanian reformers responded deeply to Kant's religious concern to protect not only God but, above all, the human being. This rational approach also means that Lithuanian Protestantism had few proponents of German mysticism except for rare cases of Arian anthropology. The other constant of Lithuanian protestant anthropology was the unity of individual subjectivity and his duty to the state and community. Basically in answer to these protestant controversies, the centre of Catholic thought emerged in Vilnius University (founded at 1579). The faculty of theology had a number of strong Catholic theoreticians, such as the first rector of the university, Petras Skarga, (1536-1612), Martynas Smigleckis, Emanuel de Vega, and others. In 1581, the faculty established the department of polemical theology, which served as the common ground for disputes among Catholics, Protestants, and Marians. The main issues in these polemics concerned the possibility of explaining the existential determination of human being by a supernatural factor, justification by faith, predestination, free will, and evil, etc. Vilnius university was a Catholic university from the very beginning, for which reason philosophy was scholastic but, as mentioned earlier, in the mould of late scholasticism as the traditional problems of theological methodology were comple- mented by the vast anthropological problematic, which had become not the starting point, but the closing theme of debates in the philosophy of religion. Despite the collectivist tone of Catholic doctrines Catholic theological anthropology dignifies the person but grounds her value not in introspection, but, in the first place, in the harmonious world order. Scholars in Lithuania even invoked a humanistic "white magic" as the means to overcome the mysteries of nature, uncover hidden principles and thus expand the inherent powers of humanity. Therefore, Lithuanian scholas- ticism combined physics and psychology with Aristotelian anthropology. Scholastic philosophy was ousted during the Enlightenment period, but the premises for the transformation of Lithuanian philosophy arose earlier even though they became apparent only after a century of stagnation into the middle of the 18th century. The Enlightenment as the age of the courageous, autonomous, open-minded man characterized by self-respect, who believed in progress, the creative forces of the individual, was not in accord with Catholic hierarchic ontology and sociology. In 1732 the head of the Jesuit order prohibited ten propositions concerning new discoveries and arguments in the natural sciences, especially with regard to the nature of matter and the mind-body dualism. But the new ideas from the natural sciences soon found their way into modern philosophy of religion. The first theoretician who advanced similar ideas in Lithuania was Antanas Skorulskis (1715-1777), a follower of Descartes. His treatise Commentariolum philosophiae was a sophisticated synthesis of the ideas proposed by ancient pagan Greek philosophers and the proponents of modern experimental natural sciences (R. Boyle, I Newton). Meanwhile the Catholic side of Europe (and Lithuania as well) adapted the system formulated by Christian Wolff, who based his ideas on the doctrine of Leibniz. £l Springer</page><page sequence="7">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 2 1 One of the basic changes in the philosophy of religion during the period of Enlightenment was the revival of the status of natural theology (theologia naturalis). It now became a branch of philosophy and moved away from the apologetic function to a critical approach. The Medieval version of this kind of theology (in addition to the theology of revelation) included only those propositions which could be accessible to the human mind. Now when epistemology was at stake, the question of God (qua theological question) was raised anew. Although Protestant theologians advocated the impossibility of dealing with the theological question "naturally," the enlighteners held much more optimistic, rationally justified views about the possibilities of natural theology, though their approach rarely escaped the reduction of phenomena of faith to rational minimalism. In Lithuania natural theology was not a focused movement. There were lectures critical of atheism, or evaluations of the traditional attributes and proofs of God as well as various dogmas and heresies. But all this was rather abstract in comparison with vital theological debates occurring throughout Europe, concerning hot only the epistemological and existential status of theological propositions, but also the role of theoretical doctrines in the lives of individuals and communities. In order to spread the vision of the ideologically free, well educated person in Lithuania it was necessary to dismantle the educational monopoly of the Jesuit order. This happened in the second half of 18th century. The first step in this "revolution" was the renunciation of Latin as the "mother tongue" of philosophy and theology, when the enlightener Kazimieras Narbutas (1738-1807) began to write in Polish. In 1791 there emerged the first example of mature national spirituality, the manuscript of "Sermons" by the deacon Kiprijonas Lukauskas (1752-1798), which we can be regarded as the beginning of Lithuanian philosophical writing. In any case it is sound to say that the debates over issues in the philosophy of religion prepared society in Lithuania to accept the worldview of the enlighteners, a development which enabled further reception of ideas from Western Europe. Contemporary Lithuanian philosophy of religion Up to the middle of the 19th century the question of belief and unbelief (the question of natural theology) was hardly debated in Lithuania. It was much more common to analyze the nature of God, the Church, Christ, and other features of historical Christianity than to raise radical doubts about traditional postulates or to re-interpret them in a critical spirit. Intense theological debates were often more marked among the proponents of the same confession than between members of different sects (for example, the problem concerning the Marian heresy). From the second half of the 19th century the problems of belief and unbelief became the major philosophical issue. On the one hand, this was the consequence of the disintegration of the Lithuanian national identity movement which had begun at that time. On the other hand, it shows the ability of Lithuanian thinkers to absorb rapidly and reflect critically the prominent schools of thought of Western (and sometimes Eastern) philosophy of religion. Starting with that period and up to the £} Springer</page><page sequence="8">22 M. Briedis present, we can talk fully about a diversified, autonomous and competent, professional, contemporary Lithuanian philosophy of religion. One of the first manifestations of this independence was the critical attitude towards the church manifested by both materialists and positivists. By relying on Enlightenment ideas, Jonas Sliupas (1861-1944) argued that education and ethics are primordial modes of a mature person, whereas religion is only a tool to satisfy an uncontrolled range of emotions. The amalgam of the most destructive emotions gives birth to an anthropomorphic God. On the other hand, the essence traditionally ascribed to this Godhead - will to power, or power to the will - is an insult to true humanity. The Marxist approach to religion had its proponents in Lithuania even before the doctrine became the official ideology of Soviet Lithuania. Irmija Zaksas (191 9- 1965) argued that the supernatural character of religion is fantastic, illusory, and consequently harmful. Seen from the perspective of an atheist, a religious worldview is somehow dualistic, and this dualism is the conditio sine qua non of any religion which brings man to complete alienation from the tangible world, 'here and now', and from his true (social) mission. According to Marxists, the dualism of religion as the expression of anxiety and weakness can be deconstructed if we succeed in exposing its ideological character and dissolving alienation through creative productivity. In answer to such reductions of religion Stasys Salkauskis (1886-1941) and others maintained that in order to comprehend truths of religion, especially of Catholicism, we need to establish very specific "inner" relationships which will enable an interiorization of religious knowledge, based on fundamental subjective experiences. Without such attitudes religious understanding is impossible. The "translation" of this kind of understanding of the Holy is an important, though secondary, technical theological problem. Alongside these major clashes in the philosophy of religion (or struggles between the reductionist approach and philosophical theology), there were interesting debates concerning specific though fundamental issues of the Christian religion. A good example is the discussion between two professors Vincas Cepinskis (1871- 1940) and Adomas Jakstas (1860-1938) concerning the very starting point (and the end) of philosophy of religion - the definition of "God." Cepinskis maintained that a suitable substitute for this fundamental notion would be "reality," because it lacks anthropomorphic features, which in turn are impregnated with human weakness. Jakstas objected that biblical personalism, or the personal character of the biblical God, amounts to anthropomorphism. The relation between God and history described in the Old Testament has no sense without the cosmic love testified in the New Testament. And this, according to Jakstas, is the best way to talk philosophically about theological issues, while Cepinskis argued that immutability is the only attribute of the absolute known to us. Jakstas responds that if this "great reality" were absolutely immutable, and that means silent, it would be a "great nothingness." The Christian theological tradition uncovers this "speaking" through the Christological event, which demonstrates that religion really is the topology of the soul in the quest for a transcendent call, and because of this it is not identical with or even complementary to science. According £i Springer</page><page sequence="9">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 23 to Jakstas, we know enough to live our lives meaningfully, which means that we should not seek for faith for the therapeutic goal, but on the contary heal ourselves in order to gain entrance to the realm of the new being uncovered by Christ. Perhaps the most prominent thinker in the history of Lithuanian philosophy, Antanas Maceina (1908-1987, a proponent of the philosophy of religion), synthesized existentialism with Christian tradition in an original manner. According to Maceina, the first step towards the Holy, be it in the traditional or personal mode of openness, is to distinguish between logical cognition and existential encounter. We cannot avoid logic as a technical instrument in the very act of thought, but abstract argumentation is often only the cognitive manifestation of hybris. A wholly different approach is to talk about encounter (presupposing participation and partnership) in terms of the phenomenology of religion, which places schemes of traditional Christianity in a new light. Following the union of phenomenology of religion (strongly influenced by R. Otto) and traditional Christianity, Maceina draws together Thomism and the Augustinian tradition. Maceina maintained that Thomas Aquinas showed that the world is not sufficient by itself, it needs the Other. This conclusion is logical and can be deduced only on the basis of lumine naturali\ revelation is not necessary. But this inferred knowledge of God remains an abstract analytic product without need for worship or a quest for radical change. We can put the point as follows - to the "mind" of Aquinas Maceina added "heart" of Augustine. While metaphysics can serve as the instrument for stronger commitment it cannot shake man's depths, and that means that the only thing which connects man to transcendence remains faith. Or we can say that logical inquiry can demonstrate or presuppose God, but cannot arrange a true meeting, which means that we are not disposed and ready to relate our existence to His. On the other hand, logic fails to express the dialogical character of religion. The notion of God as the eternal "You" cannot be expressed by psychological and/or moral terms. First of all, it is an ontological pole, and this dialogical character of reality is what sustains man in being. Hence man lives right from the moment when he encounters God. Maceina argues that God's "You" is original, and my "I" comes after, my existence is absolutely indebted to this other pole of mine. Moving from existentialism and philosophy of dialogue to Christian doctrines Maceina speculates that at the moment of the encounter God gives Himself to man as the wholeness of being. Being is what unites God and man, but for God being is a property and for man a gift. That is the essence of Christian ontology, and this is why we call man not Being in-Itself but (human) being (rooted in being itself). It is important to note that there is no man or human in a true sense prior to the act of giving. This very act of giving is the moment of emergence out of primordial Being Itself of that particular being that we call "human" being. The last stage in Maceina's philosophy of religion is the "philosophy of culture." Maceina argues that we call 'creation' that action which produces something that was not there before. This applies perfectly to God's giving, which in essence is creative. God meets man while creating him. This creation in devotion is the love of the New Testament, because love's essence is this self-emptying surrender. This is the journey into the other, taking our own being into the other's way of being. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="10">24 M. Briedis Therefore, creation is not standing before the created object but the act of love beyond the subject-object dichotomy, in ecstatic reunion. Hence the act of creation that is so fundamental for Christians is not, according to Maceina, the manifestation of power or even good will, but is an emanation of love in the form of being, and the being in which all levels of being are united is human. God's power most clearly manifests itself through love as creation, and metaphysics fails to grasp this because it lacks the personal character. In Maceina' s opinion, the task of philosophical theology (which follows the "technical", critical philosophy of religion) is to affirm this love in a systematic way (including metaphysics) and to uncover the personal character of the Holy as well as the dialogical nature of reality. This is the necessary condition for understanding the divine "You," which is the ontological basis for my own "I." The notion of God as the creator in the name of love, according to Maceina, is the best way to approach fundamental anthropological questions. Through his creative powers, whose expression is cultural diversity, the human being is able to open herself for the divine encounter if and only if the creative power is directed not to controlling and dominating the environment, but expresses care for oneself and the other. According to Maceina, the value of human existence manifests itself and can be measured by observing the cultural and individual capacity to grasp and shape creative powers. Personal events and world history reveal that a man by himself can become a revelation rather than an object in a "will to power" configuration or a subject in a routine epistemological enterprise. Maceina argues that the essence of living is identical to meaning, not only for survival but also to participate in creation. This participation is twofold - religious and cultural. "Cultural" means the ability to raise and change forms of human comprehension and action. "Religious" here means fully acknowledging the Absolute and assigning proper relations to it, i.e. participating in it through the creative powers of humanity. Therefore, the meaning of human life is to hear and respond to the transcendental call. Unless he hears this call man only is, and when he creates he, like God, lets being be. Paradoxically, human being truly is only when it responds and lives outside himself. Directly following the period during which Maceina composed his works and was recognized in the European intellectual context there came a dark era for Lithuanian philosophy. During the time of the Soviet regime any autonomous, critical philosophical enterprise became impossible. Philosophy was attached to ideology and served its needs. The official "philosophical" school during the Soviet period became Marxism-Leninism with its extremely destructive attitude towards religion. Hence philosophy of religion was eliminated from intellectual discourse except in rare cases when religion was condemned as a key feature in the class struggle. As mentioned above, Marxism considers religion to be an illusion rooted in dualistic thinking, where the illusory world is treated not only as real but as more valuable. This situation, according to Marxists, is fatal to man's integrity, i.e. his ability to function with real value in contemporary society. The naivete of religious language, images, and moral codes, and, on the other hand, their claim to express the "essence" of human being emasculates members of the social order, turning them into calculable and controllable units. Religion is the highest point of £} Springer</page><page sequence="11">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 25 alienation, therefore deconstruction of religion is considered the best way to overcome existential alienation. Marx, according to Marxists, revealed the illusion of religion as the basis for this alienation. The Marxist critique of religion was the most radical of all, because it clearly demarcates theory from practice, critical thinking, and revolution in laying bear the interests and forces behind the various religions whose ideas fail to prove their value in social practice. Concerning this situation in Lithuanian philosophical discourse during the Soviet period, we can mark as original only those thinkers who worked outside Soviet supervision. The most prominent emigrant philosopher of that time, Juozas Girnius (1915-1994), promoted Maceinas' thinking relying also on Heidegger's existential phenomenology applied to Christian anthropology. Heidegger begins his project of existential hermeneutics with the analysis of the human mode of being (Dasein). Girnius argues that theological overtones of Heideggerian thought are too often overlooked. Methodologically, we can detect these in Heidegger's notions of the question and pious thinking, which lead to a new notion of the de-substantialized self as well as the de-substantialized God. On the other hand, speaking methodologically, philosophy is the question, but the answer to philosophy is the philosophy of religion or post-dogmatic theology. Even the atheistic wings of philosophy cannot escape religion as the ultimate foundation of more specific issues, just as the cynic struggles for the truth even more fervently than the proponent of traditional morality. All other perspectives on human being are preliminary; only theology, with the support of philosophy rightly understood (as ontology and cultural criticism), can ultimately grasp human being. The thesis that the anthropological question presupposes the theological one situates Girnius close to other Christian existentialists of the time who included Heidegger in their doctrines (Bultmann, Tillich and etc.).1 Nevertheless, Girnius conjoins Heidegger with Christianity in an original way. In accordance with Heideggerian postulates concerning the facticity of human being, Girnius proceeds to think theologically. If the mode of being which is human could not reveal something about the Being-in-Itself, the theological question (about God) could not emerge. On the other hand, speaking in Kantian terms, human being is not wholly contained in or covered by processes of nature. The phenomenon of language, existential experience, certain fundamental features of morality prove that man is also and perhaps first of all a spiritual being. As the argument proceeds, Girnius rhetorically asks whether this spiritual being, or the spirituality of this being, could be the truth, should nothing else in reality resemble his spirituality2; or speaking theologically, where is the original of the human image? But how can a man come to understand that he is not the original (as the Marxists thought)? Girnius argues that spirituality means freedom, which eventually leads to guilt ("eventually" since guilt often arises when things are not done rather than done). As I cannot escape my freedom (because I am free even trying to escape it), I 1 Protestantism in its modern existential form is definitely more attractive to contemporary Lithuanian philosophers than Catholicism [Kacerauskas (2007), Briedis (2007b), Serpytyte (2003)]. A rare exception is the work of A. Plantinga who is a Catholic, not a Protestant thinker and subscribes to analysis rather than hermeneutics [Briedis (2006)1. 2 This reasoning can be called "Girnius' version of the ontological argument". £) Springer</page><page sequence="12">26 M. Briedis cannot escape this existential guilt. The conclusion of this argument is that guilt produces longing for purity, and this cannot be only the testimony of my awareness of guilt. It is the longing for eternity which brings Girnius to speculate that a man seeks not to leave a trace here (though of course this is valuable as well), but instead he really longs to be, he feels hunger for being following his natural death, and God is the hope (not just expression of this hope) for this being, just as Christ is the promise of this new mode of existence (or it maybe better to say, essence). Hence Girnius transforms the anthropological question into a theological one by reflecting on fundamental facts (or existentials) of human existence - spiritual nature, moral conscience, and longing for eternity, which usually emerge in limit situations. While reflecting on suffering, Girnius notices that the more a being is psychologically complex, the harder it is for it to achieve accomplishment, but this does not mean that it should agree to descend to a lower level of this complexity (for example, Kantian sheep). This pattern perfectly expresses the situation of the believer for whom suffering is the price to pay for his humanity. According to Girnius, suffering reveals the general ontological structure and the place of a particular being in this structure. In reality perfection cannot be distinguished from the comprehension of its opposite - limitation. The further a creature moves in moral or psychological evolution the more (perfectly) it lives its facticity.3 Climbing the stairs of perfection does not release one from suffering, a reminder that one's roots are at level lower than at present. On the contrary, this situation entails the painful feeling of dependence on the influence of lower spheres. Therefore, moral worth, meaningful being, religious ecstasy are always in tension and struggle with possible non-being (even if this non-being were existence at a lower level of spiritual reality). Moving on to thinkers who emigrated from Soviet Lithuania we must mention one of the most independent thinkers of that era to the present day - Arvydas Sliogeris (b. 1944). He is not only one of the most original thinkers in Lithuania and Eastern Europe up to now, but also an original follower of Heidegger, who, while strongly opposed to the efforts to "christen" Heidegger, often reflects on religion, faith, and theology in a fashion theoretically similar to Maceina and Girnius, despite drawing quite contrary conclusions4. Sliogeris's reception of Heidegger focuses on the concreteness of being, its ephemeral character, and non-being as the true locus of the way Being is. What traditional philosophers and theologians named by the term "God," according to Sliogeris, can be labeled as the "paradigmatic phenomenon of being." While "unparadigmatic," or "usual," or the "everyday" phenomenon of being is visible and thinkable, this "paradigmatic" phenomenon is only thinkable, if it is not visible, Sliogeris argues. Instead it has to be "believable." Hence in the vertical ascent to God, sight is replaced by faith. 3 Inorganic nature is most independent and "calm," because it does not owe its existence to any other stratum of reality, and the pain of limitation here is "frozen," it never reaches the level of expression. The problem of Heidegger's position towards theology became a matter of vital debate in Lithuanian philosophy [Kacerauskas (2008), Briedis (2007a)l. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="13">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 27 According to Sliogeris, faith is a fundamental openness towards Being. This is parousia which is compared by Heidegger to the tension experienced by the first Christians while waiting the second coming of Christ. But Sliogeris maintains that the very possibility of this tension (perhaps kierkegaardian as well) is wholly obscured and warped by the Western theological tradition which Heidegger ranked as an "ontic science" (science of "this entity"). This tradition is not able with full seriousness to comprehend the concreteness of a particular phenomenon (being of a thing), because it concentrates solely on the paradigmatic one. As mentioned above, Sliogeris's approach to the question of God strongly resembles the ideas of Maceina and Girnius. For Sliogeris, the best "proof" (double quotes, because you can proof only what is there) of God is man himself, because were there no God as "something" that is not (as something), then there could not be something as something else. Being itself and God are the same.5 Human being comprises only thinkable sight or visible thought, and this is the place where you can find God - not by the argument, but by the response, which, as in the Heideggerian mode, is quiet and passive. But here Sliogeris moves in the opposite direction to that of the aforementioned thinkers, arguing that this passive (or perhaps active in a real sense) thinking discloses me to God as to pure being, i.e. in the absence of any distorting relation. In Sliogeris's opinion, faith is not a relationship, because (again paradoxically) it is absolute relationship, the kind that negates, empties itself because it stands before that which is not relational - the Absolute. Therefore, God cannot be proved until he is mistakenly identified as a partner in dialogue, and that means objectified. Only as the very condition of any relation He is always a priori here. This is why traditional theism, according to Sliogeris, lacks the authentic attitude to the Holy: this tradition secures a notion of God mixed with relational predicates, whereas true being, as the object of traditional faith, is beyond any relations. Hence (as with Girnius) we see Sliogeris own version of the ontological argument: being and thinking are interrelated. I think, therefore there is a being, but only as "this being," because necessarily some "substantial individual" must exist who sustains this being. Ergo, if I can think something as something, God is there. This modification of the ontological argument derives God's existence not from the concept but from the very act of thinking which (phenomenologically) is always intentional. The Being of God comes out of a phenomenal being. Although different from an analytical approach, the necessary premise of this "proof consists in believing in the being of a particular thing, i.e. there is not only being, but always being as something, or this being. According to Sliogeris, were being to exist in a pure manner, not as an individual, not as "something," or as a member of a particular relation, the question of God would have never arisen. But the imperfection of tangible forms, which are the mixture of being and non-being, presupposes "religious" thinking. However, Sliogeris warns us that all this is a case of hypothetical thinking, and although there 5 Note that for Sliogeris the contrary of this proposition is not acceptable, hence although he definitely is not an atheist, he clearly speaks as antitheist. £l Springer</page><page sequence="14">28 M. Briedis is a practical maxim to conduct our lives as if God exists, we never know this for sure theoretically. I will end this brief survey of the reception of the Western philosophy of religion (or, perhaps I should say, its hermeneutic) in Lithuanian philosophy by presenting the views of perhaps the most prominent and vital philosopher in the field - Tomas Sodeika (b. 1949). His area of research is vast and includes, besides the philosophy of religion, such branches of contemporary philosophy as hermeneutics, phenom- enology, philosophy of dialogue, etc. This vast horizon is especially manifest in Sodeika' s reflections on faith and religion. Tomas Sodeika begins his analysis in an almost analytic fashion, raising the fundamental question: "what does it mean to have faith?" Sodeika argues that when someone says "I believe you" this basically means "I have faith in you," and this presupposes that I am concerned not about your proposition or set of propositions, but about the wholeness of your personality. I accept you as the reality which is in front of me. Moreover, this means that faith is the act by which I gain my personality, and faith is the indicator and foundation of the personal dimension of the world. Only in the act of faith can we transcend the sphere of anonymous things and become a person in the face of the other. Faith is a type of relation which involves an ultimate interest in its object. Hence faith is not a doctrine or intellectual enterprise. It is the tension of waiting, something that cannot be captured by following established procedures. The object of faith is reality (of the truth, the prophet, the teacher, the other) as elucidated by Kierkegaard's "Either/Or." Therefore faith is not a matter of truth or error (as with propositions), but is the question of ultimate fact - to find courage to affirm the existence of the other and respond with infinite passion. This affirmation helps in living out affinity with the other and in this way changes my own way of being, expands it. This simple fact that a man's life is meaningful only when he has a goal or a plan means that we are inevitably connected to a broader context which is given to us primordially. Once this dependence is recognized existence acquires a new start. Conclusions The foregoing survey suggests the following conclusions: 1. Lithuania's amenability to cultural and intellectual progress was conditioned by the adoption of the Christian intellectual culture. Simultaneously, this was the foundation for the formation of Lithuanian philosophy in general and philosophy of religion in particular. 2. Philosophy of religion was arguably the most vital and controversial of all branches of Lithuanian philosophy, and the most prominent Lithuanian thinkers are more or less associated with religious issues. 3. The foundation of Vilnius University played a crucial role in the development of Lithuanian philosophy in general and philosophy of religion in particular. It was part of the strategy initiated by the Jesuits to stop the spread of the 4y Springer</page><page sequence="15">The reception of western philosophy in the Lithuanian philosophy 29 Reformation in Lithuania. This event also demonstrated Lithuania's cultural development. 4. Hence, the new impulses brought by the Reformation to rethink the essence of human being and his social and existential purposes were likewise welcomed in Lithuania. This means that medieval political and cultural constructs were under attack in Lithuania as well; and this shaped the critical overtones of Lithuanian philosophy of religion in opposition to the prevailing apologetic line. 5. Philosophy of religion in Lithuania was never separated from the quest for national identity and possibilities for societal reform. The other constant of Lithuanian philosophy of religion, strongly influenced by the protestant anthropology, was the balance between reflection on the individual's subjec- tivity and his duty to the state and community. 6. The debates over issues in the philosophy of religion prepared Lithuanian society to accept the Enlightenment worldview, a fact of considerable importance as it conditioned the further reception of the ideas from Western Europe. 7. Contemporary Lithuanian philosophy of religion following the era of Marxist ideology is on the whole correlated with the philosophy of culture and is manifest in forms of Christian existentialism, hermeneutic philosophy, phenomenology of religion, philosophy of dialogue, postmodern theology, and Christian nihilism.
