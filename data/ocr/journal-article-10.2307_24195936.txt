JUDAH BEN SOLOMON ALHARIZI (Toledo, Spain c. 1170-1238) Hebrew poet and translator who lived in Spain. In 1190 Harizi visited Provence and then spent many years in the Middle East. Besides his poetic work, Takhkemoni, his fame rests on his Hebrew translation of Maimonides' Moreh Nebukhim. Harizi's translation was unfavorably criticized by his contemporaries because it failed in accuracy. Although distinguished for the elegance of his Hebrew style, this translation was superceded by Samuel Ibn Tibbon's meticulous version. In the words of David Kaufmann: "this superbly gifted and masterful poet lacked serious purpose as well as knowledge of this subject matter. His procedure seems to have been to take one glance at the Arabic original, followed by two at the ibn Tibbon version. He retained the title which ibn Tibbon had given to his translation and also incorporated a number of Samuel's passages, unchanged, into his own new work using the older translation as a guide whenever he came upon a stumbling block. Al-Harizi's Motto was elegance at any price.... In the contest between these two translations history has ruled against the later version. While ibn Tibbon's translation became one of the earliest publications in the history of Jewish printing. Seven-and-a-half centuries were to pass and all but one manuscript copy of the al-Harizi translation were to disappear before this work was first printed in London in 1851. (D. Kaufmann — see bibl., p. 228-230). The irony is that it was Harizi's translation which played an important part in the transmission of Maimonidean philosophy, because it was the basis of the</page><page sequence="2">XXII Jacob I. Dienstag early anonymous Latin translation which was studied by the Christian scholastics (J. Perles — see bibl.). It was also the basis of the Castilian version by Pedro de Toledo (D.

Steinschneider, Hebraeische Bibliographic, 15 (1875), p. 86-89). 2. NAHMANIDES (Gerona, Spain, 1194-Eretz-Israel, 1270) R. Moses b. Nahman, or Nahmanides, was the first to criticize Maimonides exegesis. In his commentary to the Pentateuch, Nahmanides often differs with the interpretations of Biblical passages given by Maimonides in order to conform to his philosophic doctrines. Maimonides, as is known, made use of the Targum of Onkelos to explain many of the anthropomorphic terms of the Bible. Onkelos, according to Maimonides, was eager to eliminate corporeal notions from the Deity, and whenever confronted with such expressions, he explained them according to their "true meaning." Nahmanides, after examining the Targum of Onkelos, criticized Maimonides, and claimed that Onkelos had in many instances, indeed translated Biblical passages according to their literal sense. If, however, the subject demanded special understanding, Onkelos translated it in accordance with his own criteria. Nahmanides insisted that the exegesis of Onkelos in no way depended upon his desire to avoid corporeal expressions of the Almighty. It should be added however, that despite Nahmanides' criticism of this point, he agreed with Maimonides in principle about the problem of anthropomorphism in the Bible. Nahmanides' criticisms did not remain unanswered. No less an authority than the famous Talmudic commentator, R. Yom-Tov b. Abraham Ishbili, known as RITBA (ca. 1270-1342) rose to the defense of Maimonides in his Sefer Zikkaron (discussed below). RITBA's work apparently escaped the attention of R. Ephraim Alnakawa (Toledo ?-Algeria, 1442) who also composed a similar defense of Maimonides entitled Sha'ar Kevod Adonai (discussed below). BIBL.: J.I.

ISAAC BEN ABRAHAM IBN LATIF (Toledo, Spain, 1210-C.1280) Kabbalist and philosopher. Ibn Latifs writings are a mixture of Kabbalah and Neoplatonism, and he was greatly influenced by Solomon Ibn Gabirol. "He had one foot inside [the Kabbalah], and one foot outside [in philosophy]", as Judah Hayyat said of him (cited by G. Scholem ,Kabbalah, 1974, p. 52). His main work, Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, was intended, according to Scholem, to be, in a speculative mystical vein, both a continuation of and a substitute for Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed (Scholem, ibid). For Ibn Latifs relationship to the philosophy of Maimonides, we are indebted to Professor Sara O. Heller-Wilensky's many studies on this subject. Although Latif devoted "a large number of chapters in his Sha'ar ha-Shamayim to a refutation of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, attacking both Aristotle and his followers with the philosophical means at his disposal", he was an admirer of Maimonides, an Aristotelian. In fact, Heller-Wilensky points out that "Latifs interpretation of the nature of magnetic attraction itself as a 'certain force communicated to the air which is in contact with the iron' is evidently based directly on the Guide and represents the general view of the Atomists" (in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, ed. A. Altmann, p. 193). Likewise, "in his criticism of Aristotle's theory of the eternity of the world, Latif contends, in agreement with Maimonides, that Aristotle's proof does not have a force of a demonstration" (ibid. p. 193). "In refutation of Aristotle", Heller-Wilensky continues, "Latif reproduces Maimonides' argument from determination, which is based upon the fact of deviations from order and regularly observed in the translunar world. Following Maimonides, Latif contends that these deviations could not be satisfactorily explained by a system of necessary causality, but only by the assumption of a free will of God" (ibid. p. 193-194). "it is interesting to note", Heller-Wilensky continues, "that unlike Maimonides, Latif most often cites al-Farabi's political writings: namely, those very works which are not cited explicitly in the Guide by Maimonides, although it is quite evident that they had influenced him" (ibid. p. 195). What is surprising is that in his treatment of the nature and function of prophecy, Latif follows al-Farabi with a certain modification introduced by Maimonides. "In agreement with al-Farabi, Latif maintains that the prophet is, unlike the philosopher, also a lawgiver, and, for that reason as well, he stands higher than the philosopher. However, following Maimonides, Latif insists that</page><page sequence="4">XXIV Jacob I. Dienstag although prophecy is a 'natural', universal process, depending upon certain human perfections, 'God may prevent one from becoming a prophet'. Thus, in agreement with Maimonides, he introduces God's will indirectly into prophecy", (ibid. p. 200). Although Latif regarded himself a faithful disciple of Maimonides, Heller Wilensky contested his assertion. Latif, she stressed, "cannot be regarded as a disciple of Maimonides, nor does he belong to the general Aristotelian trend. We may perhaps state here at the risk of over-simplification, that Latif follows Maimonides whenever the latter, knowingly or not, takes a Platonic or Neo platonic stand", (ibid. 200-201). "In according with the Neoplatonic tradition, and in agreement with Maimonides", Heller-Wilensky continues, "Latif emphasizes the principle of the unknowability of God. Thus he argues that God is ineffable, that He has no name, that He cannot be grasped by thought nor described in human language. Following Maimonides, Latif insists, that the only way in which we are allowed to speak of God is by negation...", (ibid. p. 205). On the question of Providence, Latif followed Maimonides, that the human individual's share in Divine Providence is in proportion to his intellectual powers, (ibid. p. 220-221). Heller-Wilensky also points out, that in the great debate which raged over the philosophy of Maimonides at the beginning of the thirteenth century, Latif defended the Sage with great zeal. (ibid. p. 220). Heller-Wilensky, whose critical edition of Latif s Sha'ar ha-Shamayim is to be published shortly, returned to explore the influence of the Moreh Nebukhim on this work. She quotes Latifs introduction to his work, in which he declares himself to be a faithful disciple of Maimonides and as one who follows his path: "because of my great love and desire to grasp onto the bastion of truth and to follow the view of this gaon [i.e. Maimonides] and his general intention, I have filled my heart, I, the poorest of my family and the smallest one in my father's house, a youth of the sons of Jerusalem in Spanish exile. Isaac ben Abraham, known as ibn Latif... I followed his advice and went in his path and guarded his way and did not move from it, because of the limitation of my own understanding". ("The Guide and the Gate" — see bibl., p. 267). After quoting R. Isaac ben Sheshet, that the Gate of Heaven is an imitation of Maimonides' Guide (Responsum 157), Heller-Wilensky shows in her detailed and exhaustive study how the Guide influenced the Gate. (ibid. p. 268-278). BIBL.'. S. Heller-Wilensky, "The Guide and the Gate'. The Dialectical Influence of Maimonides on Isaac ibn Latif and Early Spanish Kabbalah", A Straight Path...in Honor of A.

SHEM TOY BEN JOSEPH FALAQUERA (Spain, 1225-ca. 1290) Philosopher and translator from the Arabic into Hebrew. Among his philosophic works of interest to us is Moreh ha-Moreh (Pressburg, 1837), a commentary on the Moreh Nebukhim. As a professional translator, Falaquera severely criticized Judah Alharizi's translation of the Moreh Nebukhim and called him fool (peti). Although he respected Samuel Ibn Tibbon as superior, he found many mistakes in his translation of the Moreh: "I know that if he had paid more attention to the translation, he could have translated more correctly". {Moreh ha-Moreh, p. 157; passage translated by R. Jospe — see bibl., p. 20). Falaquera then lists all the errors he found in Tibbon's translation (p. 148-158). Raphael Jospe points out that despite his defense of Maimonides, Falaquera occasionally criticized the Master on various theological themes {Jospe, p. 29-30). Also of interest to us is Falaquera,s Mikhtav 'al Devar ha-Moreh {Letter Concerning the Guide of the Perplexed). It was published anonymously in Minhat Qena'ot by Abba Mari ben Moses ha-Yarhi of Lunel (Pressburg, 1838, p. 182-185 and reprinted in Kovets Teshuvot ha-Rambam, ed. A. Lichtenberg, part III, Leipzig 1859, leaves 23-24. The letter is a defense of Maimonides' work against the agitation of the French rabbis led by Solomon Petit in the year 1290 {Jospe, p. 75). BIBL:. R. Jospe, Torah and Sophia: the Life and Thought of Shem Τον Ibn Falaquera (1988). The Moreh ha-Moreh was reprinted in Sheloshah Kadmone Mefarshe ha-Moreh, Jerusalem 1961. 5. ABRAHAM BEN SAMUEL ABULAFIA (Saragossa, Spain, 1240-Comino? after 1291) Abraham's father died when he was eighteen, and two years later he began a life of ceaseless wandering. On his way to Rome, Abraham spent a short while in Capua, where he devoted himself with passionate zeal to the study of philosophy, especially The Guide of the Perplexed under the guidance of the philosopher and physician, Hillel ben Samuel of Verona. He was also introduced to the study of the Kabbalah by Baruch Togarmi, author of a commentary on the Sefer Yezirah. This work and that of the German mystic, Eleazar of Worms, exercised a deep influence upon him and had the effect of greatly increasing his mystical bent. Abulafia founded a new school of mysticism which instructed in the attainment of the spirit of prophecy (called Prophetic Kabbalah). It was during</page><page sequence="6">XXVI Jacob I. Dienstag his wandering that he wrote several of his kabbalistic works, among which are mystical commentaries to The Guide of the Perplexed: Sitrei Torah, Hayei ha Nefesh and Sefer ha-Ge'ulah, in which Maimonides is credited with kabbalistic leanings (these titles are included in M. Idel's Abraham Abulafia's Works and Doctrines, Hebrew University dissertation, 1976). In his introduction to Hayei ha-Nefesh, Abulafia writes: '"And I will declare to you thirty-six mysteries and future marvels... as I gathered them from The Guide of the Perplexed". He thus, in the words of Idel, "advocates a theology similar to that of Maimonides in lieu of the Kabbalilstic theosophy...". (The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia, p. 8). Abulafia, according to Scholem, "steeped himself in philosophy and conceived for Maimonides an admiration that proved lifelong. For him there was no antithesis between mysticism and the doctrine of Maimonides. He rather considered his own mystical theory as the final step forward from The Guide of the Perplexed...". "In the opinion of Abulafia", Scholem continues, "his own doctrine of prophetic ecstacy is in the last resort nothing but the doctrine of prophecy advanced by the Jewish philosophers, more especially by Maimonides, who also defines prophecy as a temporary union of the human and the divine intellect, deliberately brought about through systematic preparation...", (ibid, p. 138-139; see also Idel, ibid., p. 3-74). In his messianic speculation, Abulafia seems to agree with Maimonides that the Messiah does not have to perform miracles (Abraham Berger in Essays on Jewish Life and Thought Presented to S.W. Baron, 1959, p. 59). Abulafia is also the author of a laudatory poem in honor of Maimonides (ed. M. Steinschneider, Kovez al-Yad, I, 1885, p. 4, no. 15; p. 6, no. 23; listed in I. Davidson, Thesaurus, I, p. 384, no. 8490; II, p. 119, no. 65; IV, p. 283, no. 8490). Abulafia's most distinguished disciple was Joseph Gikatilla (S. Blickstein, Between Philosophy and Mysticism: Joseph Giqatila, Thesis, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1983, p. 111-115). BIBL:. J.I. Dienstag, Da'at 25 (1990), p. 53-56 (bibliography; 23 entries). 6. JOSEPH BEN ABRAHAM GIKATILLA (Medinaceli, Castile, Spain, 1248 Penafiel, c. 1325) Kabbalist. Lived for many years in Segovia. He studied under Abraham Abulafia, who praised him as his most successful pupil. Gikatilla was also versed in various secular sciences. Like Abulafia, Gikatilla too wrote comments on the Moreh Nebukhim (printed in She'elot Saul Ha-Kohen, Venice 1574, leaves 19-31). Ephraim Gottlieb has shown, that the Oxford manuscript (1911) entitled Hasagot 'al</page><page sequence="7">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XXVII Moreh Nebukhim (Critical comments on Moreh Nebukhim) by Gikatilla, is an absolute forgery, having no connection with the above work. There is no similarity between the above work and the Oxford manuscript. The views expressed in the printed work relating to the Moreh Nebukhim are most similar in spirit to those expressed in Gikatilla,s major kabbalistic work, Ginat Egoz (:Tarbiz 39 (1969), p. 69-78). "In common with his mentor Abulafia", Scholem wrote, "Gikatilla linked his mystic lore with the system practiced by Maimonides". (Encyc. Jud. VII, p. 564). Scholem also pointed out, that the four-fold interpretation of Scripture (PaRDeS) is found in Gikatilla's theories of prophecy, attributes and miracles (Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought, 8 (1989), pp. 218, 220, 221, 223). In the Ginat Egoz, Gikatilla explains the Tetragrammaton in the spirit of Maimonides (M. Ch. Weiler, Temirin, 1,1972, p. 159). His views on darkness is referred by him to the Moreh Nebukhim, III, 10 (M. Hallamish, Bar-Ilan, VII-VIII (1970), p. 214, note 21). Finally, Shlomo Blickstein (.Between Philosophy and Mysticism: A Study of the Philosophical-Qabbalistic Writings of Joseph Giqatila, Thesis, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1963, p. 42-61), has carefully analyzed Gikatila's comments on the Guide of the Perplexed. BIBL.: J.I. Dienstag, Da'at 25 (1990), p. 79-81 ;26 (1991), p. 61 (22 entries bibl.).

JACOB BEN SHESHET GERONDI (Gerona, Catalonia, mid-13th cent.) Kabbalist. His works include: Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim (ed. G. Vajda, 1969); Sha'ar ha-Shamayim in Ozar Nehmad(1860), p. 153-65; and Ha-Emunah ve-ha Bittahon (first published in Arzei Levanon (Venice, 1601) and in Kitvei ha Ramban (ed. Chavel, 1964). R. Jacob, according to Scholem, differed from the other members of the Gerona kabbalists who "sought to expound their opinions, perhaps veiled and softened, but certainly without a polemical tone. With Jacob ben Shesheth, the Kabbalists appear on the battlefield for the first time, undisguised. The enemy is unmistakable: the radical philosophic enlightenment of the adherents of Maimonides". (Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 377). The main target is Samuel ibn Tibbon, the Hebrew translator of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, Jacob's polemical work, Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim, is a detailed attack on Ibn Tibbon's Ma'amar Yikavu ha-Mayim (Pressburg, 1837) for his views on creation. Jacob, according to Scholem, "does indeed strain to</page><page sequence="8">XXVIII Jacob I. Dienstag draw a distinction between Samuel and his master and model, Maimonides. The latter stood much too high in his esteem, as in that of many other kabbalists, for Jacob to dare to attack him directly. Rather, he seeks to prove that it was ibn Tibbon who introduced the problematic heretical opinions into the system of Maimonides. This system, known to him, after all, only through the Hebrew translation of ibn Tibbon himself and not in the original Arabic, is in Jacob's opinion very close to the true theology and therefore to the Kabbalah, as he frequentlyl and almost triumphantly notes whenever he believes that he can demonstrate that his adversary misunderstood the views of Maimonides. For him Aristotle and ibn Tibbon, not Aristotle and Maimonides, are the two heresiarchs. Indeed, in order "to dupe the vulgar" (le-rammoth he-hamon), ibn Tibbon made hypocritical use of pious words, avoiding any expression of his true opinion, which he concealed behind ambiguous phrases or through the prudently measured use of certain turns of phrase. In this manner he hoped to poison the crowd indirectly and gradually and to seduce it, by means of the orthodox appearance of his doctrines, into accepting and absorbing unwittingly what in the author's opinion were frightful heresies. The polemical part of Jacob's book is therefore largely devoted to exposing ibn Tibbon. The mask of the hypocrite and transgressor must be ripped off, and the dangerous implications of his (Averroist?) heresies must be clearly exposed and refuted on the basis of religious and heresy hunting, though one may doubt whether ibn Tibbon was at heart really as orthodox as he pretended."

MA'AREKHET HA-ELOHUT ("The Order of Godhead") An anonymous systematic book of early kabbalistic literature. In the edition published in Ferrara, 1557, the book is attributed to Perez the Tosafist. Steinschneider and later bibliographers list this work under Perez b. Isaac Kohen Gerondi. Scholem is certain that it was written by a pupil of Solomon b. Abraham Aderet (1236-1310). It was pointed out by the historian of philosophy, David Neumark, that the author of this work defined the concept of God according to its definition in the Moreh Nebukhim. This author's remarks about Moses are based on Maimonides, without mentioning its source. He, also, according to Neumark, suggested a philosophic view based on that of Maimonides in complete opposition to his kabbalistic outlook. BIBL.: G.

ABRAHAM ISHBILI or RITBA (Spain, ca. 1270-ca. 1342) Famous Talmudic commentator and is known in Rabbinical literature as RITBA, derived from the initials of his name. "Ishbili" is the equivalent of Seville, a city in Spain. He was living at Alcolea de Cinca in 1342 and was a pupil of R. Aaron ha-Levi and Solomon b. Aderet at Barcelona. Although he is mainly known for his voluminous commentary on many of the Talmudic treatises, RITBA is also considered by some to be the author of the anonymous commentary to Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, H. Yesodei ha-Torah, chapters I-IV (Eliezer Ashkenazi, Ma'aseha-Shem, Warsaw, 1871, p. 100b-101 a). We shall, however, confine ourselves to a discussion of his Sefer Zikkaron, which is a defense of the Biblical exegesis of Maimonides as expounded in the Guide of the Perplexed. It was R. Moses ben Nahman, or Nahmanides, who was the first to criticize this aspect of the Guide. In his Commentary to the Pentateuch, Nahmanides often differed with the interpretation of Biblical passages given by Maimonides in order to conform to his philosophic doctrines (Kalman Kahana, introduction to Sefer Zikkaron, 1956, p. 7-10; 1982 ed., p. 7-13). Maimonides, as is known, made use of the Targum of Onkelos to explain many of the anthropomorphic terms of the Bible. Onkelos, according to Maimonides, was eager to eliminate corporeal notions from the Deity, and whenever confronted with such expressions, he explained them according to their "true meaning". Nahmanides, after examining the Targum of Onkelos, criticized Maimonides and claimed that Onkelos had, in many instances indeed, translated Biblical passages according to their literal sense. If, however, the subject demanded special understanding, Onkelos translated it in accordance with his own criteria. Nahmanides insisted that the exegesis of Onkelos in no way depended upon his desire to avoid corporeal expressions of the Almighty. In reverance for the Master, RITBA points out that the teachings of Maimonides have been accepted by all Israel. Through Maimonides, people were indoctrinated in the proper beliefs as to the creation of the world, the removal of corporeal notions and the reasons for the Commandments. Even though, in his modesty, he feels too inadequate to take sides between such great savants, he, nevertheless, feels obliged to defend the honor of Maimonides, whom he sees as unfairly attacked by Nahmanides. The strong language used by the latter, RITBA attributes to his preoccupation with kabbalah.</page><page sequence="10">XXX Jacob I. Dienstag A mystic himself, RITBA still believed in the validity of Maimonides' philosophic approach, and contended that Maimonides should not be criticized, for there are "many aspects to the Torah". Specifically, RITBA accuses Nahmanides of not being careful in reading the Guide of the Perplexed, and of abbreviating and altering words or quotations from it. It is possible, RITBA continues, that Nahmanides used the translation of the Guide by R. Judah al Harizi, which is less exact than that of R. Samuel Ibn Tibbon used by RITBA, who also studied it in the Arabic original (Kahana, loc. cit., 1956 ed., p. 20-27; 1982, p. 28-37). As to reasons for the Commandments in the Guide, RITBA believes that Maimonides elaborated on them, not so much for the intrinsic validity of the reasons he offered, but because they offered rationalized refutations of the views held by unbelievers. Maimonides, in RITBA,s opinion, did not hesitate tto explain the reason for a Commandment which was valid only for the time in which it was decreed, although the Commandments as such were given for posterity. RITBA also discerns identical views held by R. Abraham Ibn Ezra. RITBA influenced some of the scholars who flourished between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, such as R. Judah ben Solomon Campanton (a disciple of RITBA) in his work, Arba'ah Kinyanim, R. Abraham Shalom in his work, Neveh Shalom, and R. Joseph b. Moses di Trani in his Zafenat Pa'neah (Kahana, 1956, p. 14-18; 1982 ed., p. 18-24). His work, however, escaped the attention of R. Ephraim Alnakawa, who, like RITBA, also composed a similar defense of Maimonides, entitled, Sha'ar Kevod Adonai (Tunis, 1902). BIBLJacob I.

He may have also resided in Tudela. Of concern to us is his book, Derashot al ha-Torah (Constantinople 1523; Cracow 1573 (facsimile ed. Jerusalem 1969 with introduction by S. Abramson), which contains sermons he delivered in the local synagogue, revealing a complete mastery of medieval Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah. Carmi Horowitz, in his excellent work on Ibn Shu'eib (see bibl.), has presented us with a detailed study of the various topics discussed in the Derashot, his sources and influences. On the subject of proper government, aristocracy and authority, Ibn Shu'eib was influenced by Maimonides (Horowitz, p. 38-42). In his ethical theory, moderation, sublimation and asceticism, Ibn Shu'eib, like Maimonides, informs his listeners that, "the intention of our perfect Torah is that man should walk in the middle path (ibid. p. 54). Following Maimonides, Ibn Shu'eib defines the nature of God's providence as extended to all creatures, but in different degrees (ibid. p. 70). Unlike Maimonides, Ibn Shu'eib defends those who believe in astrological determinism (ibid. p. 71-72).</page><page sequence="12">XXXII Jacob I. Dienstag On the subject of miracles, Ibn Shu'eib endorses the notion of God's complete and unrestricted freedom to change the laws of nature. He rejects the views of Maimonides and Judah Halevi in order to "reconcile the possibility of miracles with God's expressed promise to observe laws which He has established in the Universe" (ibid. p. 77-79). On the subject of prophecy, Ibn Shu'eib's conception coincides with Halevi's which, unlike that of Maimonides, does not require intellectual perfection (p. 79-81). Although alluding much to Maimonides' contention that prayer is superior to sacrifices, Ibn Shu'eib's theory of prayer is predominantly influenced by kabbalistic tradition. Horowitz points out, that Ibn Shu'eib ignored Maimonides' historical explanations and preferred instead to emphasize the great mysteries of the sacrifices (ibid. p. 131-132). The problem of evil is another theme which caused Ibn Shu'eib to side with the Kabbalists against the views of the rationalists, especially Maimonides. In opposition to Maimonides' view that Satan and the Angel of Death are powers inherent in matter itself, Ibn Shu'eib claimed that the ultimate source of evil is the primeval snake (ibid. p. 171-173).

Abramson, Introduction to the facsimile Cracow 1573 edition (Jerusalem 1969, p. 27-29). 12. SAMUEL IBN SENEH ZARZA (Valencia, Spain, 14th cent.) Philosopher. Very little is known about his life. Zarza was active in Spain during the years 1360-1380 and composed two works: a) Mekor Hayim, a super philosophical commentary to R. Abraham Ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch (Mantua 1559); b) Mikhlal Yofi, a commentary to the Agadot and Midrashim, extant in manuscript alone (listed in A. Freimann, Union Catalog of Hebrew Manuscripts and Their Location, Vol. II. New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1964, no. 5367 p. 208). However, Zarza's introduction to the 'Mikhlal Yofi', was recently published by Gitit Holtzman (see bibl.). In the Mekor Hayim, Zarza mentions four other works that he wrote, which are no longer extant. Although "Averroes" doctrines were unquestionably the dominant ones during the fourteenth century, by contrast, in several respects Zarza's teaching constitutes an explicitly Neoplatonic teaching. Zarza's ethical teaching, according to Dov Schwartz (see bibl.), is based upon the principles of Maimonides, albeit proposing somewhat ambiguous formulations without regard to extreme asceticism. He tends to base man's character attributes upon his physiological structure. Good and bad behavior are, therefore, based upon man's phlegmatic structure.</page><page sequence="13">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XXXIII Zarza's doctrine of providence is most paradoxical. Undoubtedly, Zarza was aware of Maimonides' severe criticism of astrology, as shown by his famous Epistle to the Rabbis of France. On the subject of this pseudo-science, Zarza followed R. Abraham Ibn Ezra. According to Ibn Ezra, "it lies within the power of the perfect man or of the elite group to free themselves from the network of astrological forces. It follows from this, that there is a certain utilitarian value to involvement in astrology as a way of saving oneself from troubles, knowledge of the future, etc.". Nevertheless, Zarza was influenced by "Maimonides' intellectual understanding of the nature of providence. In this view, the criterion for the level of providence is the intellectual status of the object of providence: the one presents the abundance of providence which flows from God as real, while the latter alludes to the human intellect as the source of providence and therefore not as an authentic divine function" (Schwartz, p. iv-v). Although on the nature of Mosaic prophecy, Zarza repeats the esoteric expressions of the Moreh Nebukhim, he, nevertheless, departs from the general Maimonidean concept of prophecy. The reasons for the Commandments in Zarza's thought reflect, according to Schwartz, the Maimonidean tradition: "[They] are fully detailed and pushed to an extreme in [his] teaching". BIBL.·.

HASDAI CRESCAS (Barcelona c. 1340 — Saragossa c. 1412) Rabbi, statesman and philosopher. He negotiated with Pedro IV of Aragon (King 1336-87) in behalf of the Jewish community, and was a favorite at the court of Juan I (King 1387-95). During the pogrom of 1391, Hasdai's son died a martyr. About 1390 he moved to Saragossa, where he was appointed rabbi and where he engaged in literary activity until his death. Like Judah Halevi and Nahmanides, Crescas tried to liberate Jewish thought from the bondage of Aristotelianism. To Maimonides Aristotle was the indisputable authority for all matters pertaining to sublunar existence. Halevi and Nahmanides could not view with the dominating personality of the Sage of Fostat. It remained, therefore, for Crescas to take up the cudgels against the domination of Jewish belief and thought by the alien Greek speculation. Crescas did not condemn reason, but made use of it to expose its very limitations. His chief work against Maimonides' Moreh Nebukhim is the Or Adonai (Light of the Lord), Ferrara, 1555; rep. Vienna, 1859, 1866.</page><page sequence="14">XXXIV Jacob I. Dienstag The first division of the Or is a discussion of the 25 propositions by means of which Maimonides had summarized Aristotelian philosophy in his introduction to the second part of the Moreh Nebukhim, in order to prove the existence, unity, and incorporeality of God; Crescas' object "was to show that the Aristotelian explanation of the universe as outlined by Maimonides in his propositions was false and that the proofs of the existence of God which they were supposed to establish were groundless" (H.A. Wolfson, Crescas, p. 3). "But", continues Wolfson, "not wishing to appear as if he were arguing in the absence of his opponent, he felt it was necessary for him to present Aristotle's case before trying to demolish it" (Wolfson, ibid.)· BIBL.·.

EPHRAIM BEN ISRAEL ALNAKAWA (Toledo Spain, ? — Tlemcen, North Africa, 1442) Physician, rabbi and theologian; founder of the Jewish community at Tlemcen. According to a legend, Alnakawa escaped from the Spanish Inquisition, which had martyred his father and mother at the stake, and came to Africa mounted on a lion, using a serpent as a halter. Azulai refers to him as a miracle worker. Alnakawa succeeded, after all other physicians had failed, in curing the only daughter of a king of the family Beni Zion. Refusing the reward of gold and silver offered to him by the king, he begged only that the Jewish living near Tlemcen might be united in it. In this way the community was formed. Alnakawa's first care was to establish a large synagogue. Above the rabbi's chair, on which the verse Jer. xvii. 12 is engraved, a lamp burns perpetually. Alnakawa's grave, surrounded by those of his family, is in the old cemetery; it is sacred to North African Jews, and was frequently visited by pilgrims from all parts of Algeria. Besides religious hymns, Alnakawa wrote: Sha'ar KevodAdonai, Tunis 1902. This work is a refutation of Nahmanides' criticism of the Guide. R. Moses b. Nahman, or Nahmanides, (Gerona, 1194-Palestine, 1270) was the first to criticize Maimonides' exegesis. In his commentary to the Pentateuch, Nahmanides often differs with the interpretations of Biblical passages given by Maimonides in order to conform to his philosophic doctrines. Maimonides, as is known, made use of the Targum of Onkelos to explain many of the</page><page sequence="15">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XXXV anthropomorphic terms of the Bible. Onkelos, according to Maimonides, was eager to eliminate corporeal notions from the Deity, and whenever confronted with such expressions he explained them according to their "true meaning." Nahmanides, after examining the Targum of Onkelos, criticized Maimonides, and claimed that Onkelos had in many instances, indeed translated Biblical passages according to their literal sense. If, however, the subject demanded special understanding, Onkelos translated it in accordance with his own criteria. Nahmanides insisted that the exegesis of Onkelos in no way depended upon his desire to avoid corporeal expressions of the Almighty. It should be added however, that despite Nahmanides' criticism of this point, he agreed with Maimonides in principle about the problem of anthropomorphism in the Bible. Alnakawa, a product of pre-expulsion Spain, exhibits a wide knowledge of medieval philosophy, and frequently quotes the Emunah Ramah by R. Abraham Ibn Daud (Toledo, 1110-1180), Or Adonai by R. Hasdai Crescas (Barcelona, 1340-1410) and Milhamot Adonai by R. Levi ben Gershon, (Bagnold, 1288-1344). In his refutation of Nahmanides criticism of Maimonides' dependence upon the Targum of Onkelos, Alnakawa seems to have made use of other readings of the Targum, "for according to this translation there is no more place for Nahmanides to err" (Sha'ar Kevod, 48 a). Whether Alnakawa was aware of a similar work in defense of Maimonides, entitled Sefer Zikkaron by R. YOM-TOV B. ABRAHAM ISHBILI (RITBA), who preceded him exactly by a century (1270-1342), we are not in a position to determine (Κ. Kahane See bibl.) Alnakawa also composed a poem in praise of the Moreh Nebukhim listed by I. Davidson, Thesaurus of Mediaeval Hebrew Poetry, vol. 3, p. 197, no. 2 and included by A.

ALFONSO DE LA TORRE (Burgos ? 1410 ?-1460 ?) Spanish converso. Graduated in Arts and Theology at Salamanca. As a political opponent of Alvaro de Luna, Torre fled to the Kingdom of Aragon on the success of his enemy. He was well received there. Although he was a composer of love poems, Torre is known principally for his work, Vision Delectable de la Filosofla y Artes Liberales (there are numerous variants of the title). Composed probably between the years 1430 and 1440, at the request of Don Juan de Beamonte, for the instruction of the young Prince Carlos of Viana, this work, which gained its author the epithet of el gran filosofo among his</page><page sequence="16">XXXVI Jacob I. Dienstag contemporaries, treats in allegorical form the Seven Liberal Arts of the medieval curriculum plus the chief problems of scholastic philosophy, theology, ethics and politics. J.P.W. Crawford (see bibl.) has shown that chapters eight to nineteen of the First Part, which discuss the most important questions of scholastic philosophy and theology, are derived from the Moreh Nebukhim. By detailed analyses of the subjects discussed in the Vision Delectable, Crawford successfully showed the indebtedness of Alfonso de la Torre to Maimonides' work. BIBL:. J.P.W. Crawford, "The Vision Delectable of Alfonso de la Torre and Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed", Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, XXVIII, 2 (1913), p. 188-212; Kindlers Literatur Lexikon, 7 (1972), p. 650-651; Ward, Oxford Companion to Spanish Literature, p. 572. The Vision Delectable was published in Burgos about 1485. By one of those ironic coincidences that bedevil medieval bibliography, Torre's Vision was translated into Italian in 1556 by Domenico Delphini without mention of the original author. This Italian version was re-translated into Spanish by a Spanish Jew, Francisco Caceras, who thought that he was introducing a novelty into Spain. 16. DAVID BEN SOLOMON, IBN YAHYA (Lisbon, 1440-Constantinople, 1524) Rabbi, grammarian and commentator. In 1477 was appointed rabbi in his native Lisbon. Accused of inducing the Marranos to relapse into Judaism, Ibn Yahya was sentenced by King Joao II to be burned at the stake. He succeeded in escaping with his family to Naples and then to Corfu. After much hardship he arrived in Constantinople, where most of his works were written. Of interest to us is his unpublished commentary to the Guide of the Perplexed entitled Biur Hakdamath ha-Moreh, "Commentary to the Introduction to the Guide of the Perplexed" (MS. Paris, H.

There are extant in manuscript translations which he made into Hebrew of two Latin works, one a compendium</page><page sequence="17">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XXXVII of the physical sciences by Albertus Magnus, the other, a discussion of certain problems on Aristotle's Organon by Marsilius of Inghen. Shalom's only published work in Hebrew is a defense of Maimonides' philosophy, Neveh Shalom (Constantinople, 1538; reprinted: Venice, 1574). This work, according to H. Davidson (see bibl.), gives evidence of the author's thorough command of the fields of knowledge of his time, and is rich in quotations from Greek and Arabic philosophical literature. The philosophic topics discussed are: (a) The existence, unity and incorporeality of God; (b) Divine attributes; (c) The structure of the universe; (d) The creation of the world, (e) Divine knowledge and divine providence; (0 Human soul, intellect and immortality; (g) Human knowledge, prophetic knowledge, and scripture. Shalom reviews the philosophic statements of his predecessors, especially Gersonides (1288-1344) and Hasdai Crescas (1340-1410). Gersonides, the radical Aristotelian, criticized Maimonides for compromising philosophy because of religious considerations. Crescas, the conservative, criticized the Master for having gone too far in frequently following Aristotelian philosophy instead of Jewish tradition. These two philosophers were, respectively, the outstanding representatives of the two types of criticism (Davidson, p. 9). Although Shalom expresses his high regard for these two philosophers, "It is Maimonides, however, who commands [his] highest respect". All of the words of Maimonides, he writes, are "pure, free of the dross of confusion". Consequently, in all religious matters the rule to be followed is that "Moses [Maimonides] is true and his torah is true" (Davidson, p. 10). BIBL. : H.A.

Very little is known about Pedro de Toledo, who was probably a converso (convert to Christianity). His name is associated with the Spanish translation of the Guide of the Perplexed. Pedro's version, the first living language into which the Guide has been translated, was commissioned by Gomez Suarez de Figueroa, scion of one of Castile's most prominent noble families, which subsequently produced numerous statesmen, generals, poets and scholars.</page><page sequence="18">XXXVIII Jacob I.

A student of Christian theology, he engaged in numerous disputations with Christian scholars on the trinity and other Christian tenets at the court of Juan II, king of Aragon. He probably died shortly before the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. A commentator on Aristotle (1446), it is his chief work, Derekh Emunah (The Path of Faith) in which he offered a defense of the philosophy of Maimonides, that concerns us. Written in Saragossa around the year 1480, the Derekh 'Emunah was first</page><page sequence="19">Jacob I. Dienstag XXXIX published in 1521. Bibago refers to Jewish, Islamic, Christian and Greek philosophers. But the one most frequently cited is Maimonides, who is usually called simply "The Master" (ha-Rav) or "ha-Rav ha-Moreh" (The Master of the Guide) in reference to his chief philosophical work, the Moreh Nebukhim. There is hardly a page in which Maimonides is not referred to. In his devotion to Maimonides, Bibago is very critical of those who attack the Sage "in order to appear pious in the eyes of the multitude". Bibago mentions a treatise that he wrote defending Maimonides against the criticisms made by Nahmanides in his commentary to the Pentateuch.

Though he was the son of the anti-Aristotelian Kabbalist, Ibn Shem-Tov ben Shem-Tov, author of the Sefer ha-Emunot against Maimonides, Isaac was an admirer of the latter, and author of commentaries on Aristotle and other philosophers, among which is a commentary on the Guide, mentioned by R. Moshe Alashkar in his Responsa, no. 117 (reprinted in his Hasagot 2, 6 on the above-mentioned Sefer ha-Emunot). This commentary, entitled Lehem ha-Panim, on Part I of the Guide, is found in the British Museum, no. 912 (Or. 1388), and described by G. Margoliouth in his Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the British Museum, part III, p. 218-219. The MS. is incomplete, chapters xlvi-xlviii are missing. Michael Friedlaender, translator of the Guide into English, who examined this MS., described this commentary thus: "The object of the Commentary is to show that there is no contradiction between Maimonides and the Divine Law. He praised Maimonides as a true believer in Creatio ex nihilo, whilst Ibn Ezra and Gersonides assumed a prima materia... Nahmanides is called ha-Hasid ha Gadol [the great pietist], but is nevertheless blamed, together with Narboni and Zerahiah (ha-Levi) [Gracian], for criticizing Maimonides, instead of trying to explain startling utterances even in "a forced way" (bederekh rahok); Narboni, 'in spite of his wisdom, frequently misunderstood the Moreh [Guide]'. At the end of each chapter a resume [derush] of the contents of the chapter is given, and the</page><page sequence="20">XL Jacob I. Dienstag lesson to be derived from it" (Introduction to Guide for the Perplexed, XXXIV). From the few extracts quoted by Margoliouth in his description, it appears that Isaac did not entirely escape the Kabbalists milieu, which permeated the house of his father: "The commentary displays the author's Cabalistic leaning and his anxiety wherever possible to reconcile Maimonides' philosophical position with ideas of the Cabalah" (Margolioth, ibid, p. 218b). It is interesting to compare the literary activity of Isaac Ibn Shem-Tov with that of his older brother Joseph Ibn Shem-Tov and of his nephew Shem-Tov ben Joseph Ibn Shem-Tov. They were all prolific writers of commentaries on standard philosophic texts. This must have become a sort of family specialization with them as translation had been with the Tibbonites. They also show a common interest in their choice of subject. All of them wrote commentaries on the Moreh Nebukim and on selected works of Averroes. They all were critical students of Hasdai Crescas, showing a rather hostile attitude toward him, as a result, perhaps, of their reaction against the opposition to philosophy on the part of their father, Shem-Tov Ibn Shem-Tov.

SHEM-TOV BEN JOSEPH BEN SHEM-TOV (Spain, 15th century) Rabbi, philosopher and preacher, grandson of the anti-Maimonidean Kabbalist, Ibn Shem-Tov ben Shem-Tov. Lived in Segovia and Almazan. He was a follower of Maimonides, even though his grandfather was one of Maimonides' most uncompromising opponents and though his father did not agree with Maimonides on essential points in his philosophy. He wrote several Hebrew works on philosophic subjects and commentaries on Averroes' intermediate commentaries on Aristotle's Physics and De Anima. Only two of his works have been printed, Derashot ha-Torah, Homilies on the Pentateuch, written in 1489 and printed several times, and a commentary on the Guide printed in most editions of the Moreh. As a preacher, Shem-Tov, following Maimonides, taught that only the man of intellect is in the image of God. It is for his commentary on the Guide that Shem-Tov is generally known; this</page><page sequence="21">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XLI he wrote for the purpose of reconciling "reason" (philosophy) and "law" (religion). He frequently quotes the commentary of Profiat Duran, to which his remarks are sometimes only supplementary, and also the commentary of Narboni, with whom he takes issue. His commentary "is profuse, and includes almost a paraphrase of the text. He apologizes in conclusion for having written many superfluous notes and added explanations where no explanation is required; his excuse is that he did not only intend to write a commentary... but also a work complete in itself... He often calls the reader's attention to things which are plain and clear" (M. Friedlander, Introduction to Guide for the Perplexed, ρ XXXV). Shem-Tov extols the Guide: 'He who knows this book and observes it meticulously is beloved above and pleasant below, and he is assured that he is a member of the world to come". His devotion to Maimonides was second only to that of Aristotle. In commenting on the Aristotelian propositions, that Maimonides held necessary for the proof of God's existence, unity, and incorporeality, he severely ridiculed Hasdai Crescas, the great critique of Aristotle, for refuting in his OrAdonai these proofs. In his commentary on the Guide he concludes his proof of the first proposition with the following words: "When you have grasped the meaning of these two arguments you will be able to answer all the objections against the Master raised by Rabbi Hasdai in his commentary on this proposition, for against these two arguments no doubt and objection can be raised except by a perverse fool who is incapable of understanding. Similarly all the objections and criticism levelled by Rabbi Hasdai against the Aristotelian proofs of this proposition are mere figments of the imagination, for the truth of these proofs can be understood by anyone whom God has endowed with reason and understanding to be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood" (Harry A. Wolfson, Crescas' Critique of Aristotle, p. 33). "To a confirmed Aristotelian like Shem-Tov", writes Wolfson, "evidently, any attempt to question the veracity of his master's teachings could not be explained except on the ground of a perversity of judgment" (loc. cit.). Crescas is not the only target in Ibn Shem-Tov's commentary. No other than Nahmanides (R. Moses ben Nahman) is criticized by him (Commentary to Guide, I, 27; II, 29).

MOSES BEN ISAAC ALASHKAR (Spain, 1465 — Jerusalem, 1542) Talmudic scholar and liturgical poet. After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, R. Moses lived in Tunis, Greece (as head of a yeshiva), Cairo, where he was appointed as Dayan (rabbinical judge). He was the recipient of many halachic inquiries from various communities and his responsa were printed in Sabionetta, 1553. He was an adherent of Maimonides, but at the same time had leanings towards the Kabbalah. In his responsa, Alashkar extensively made use of Maimonides' Code, Mishneh Torah. It is rarely that it is not referred to in the responsa. In fact, a number of these mainly deal with interpretations of texts in Maimonides' code. Some of the controversies in which Alashkar engaged resulted because he insisted on following Maimonides' opinion, even though it differed from that of the other authorities. He also made use of Maimonides' Responsa and Book of Commandments. Like many other kabbalists, Alashkar ascribed to Maimonides the authorship of the books entitled Megilath Setarim (Resp. 118). In this book, Maimonides was to have admitted to one of his pupils the superiority of kabbalah over that of philosophy: Some of its ways (Kabbalah) I have taken unto me in order to understand the nature of things. Many questions which puzzled me were solved as a result. I became aware of all the misleading roads. The keys of wisdsom as well as the clarification of all that was mysterious, were transmitted to me. I swear thee not to reveal these delicate secrets and these wonderful explanations to any except those who have delicate minds and natures; who are clean in their behaviors, whose thoughts are pure and who walk in the paths of knowledge and learning. Of course, modern scholars deny the authenticity of this story (G. Scholem, Tarbiz, VI, 1935, p. 338-339 [=Sefer ha-Rambam Shel Tarbiz, p. 94-95], As a result of Ibn Shem-Tov ben Shem-Tov's attack on Maimonides in his Sefer ha-Emunot (Ferrara, 1556), Alashkar launched a strong defense of the Master. His criticism of Ibn Shem-Tov which was printed in his Responsa (117) and at the end of the Sefer ha-Emunot (Ferrara, 1556), was sharp in tone: If he [shem-Tov] had refuted him [Maimonides] properly, or had found some blemish in his words, or had shown that he was mistaken I would have kept silent. He accused him, however, of denying fundamental principles of Torah and made of him a sinner and called him a heretic and other such names. The heavens are astounded and the earth mourns</page><page sequence="23">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XLIII because of such things. (Eng. translation by S.A. Turk,/?. Moses Alashkar, thesis, Yeshiva, 1958, p. 178). Alashkar then proceeds to analyze each of the subjects discussed by Ibn Shem Τον in the light of Maimonidean thoughts (e.g.: creation, soul and immortality, resurrection, reward and punishment, providence, revelation and reasons for the commandments), and sharply rebutted Ibn Shem-Tov's accusations. In conclusion he wrote: Heaven is my witness that it is not for my glory and not for the glory of my family that I have done this; and not to increase knowledge have I refuted this [Ibn Shem-Tov's work]. It is only to defend the honor of our teacher, that I have hurried and did not tarry. I said this is a time to do something for the sake of God. I have taken off the mask of modesty from my face and I refuted him and protested his deeds. My thoughts were accompanied with pain and a man cannot be blamed when he is in pain.

Dienstag, Daat 25 (1990), p. 71 (bibl.). 23. DON ISAAC ABRABANEL (Lisbon, 1437-Venice, 1508) Statesman, Bible commentator and theologian. He served as treasurer to Alfonso V of Portugal until the latter's death and subsequently served Ferdinand and Isabella. Upon the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Abrabanel settled in Naples and finally in Venice (1503), where he completed his writings begun in Portugal and Spain. Abrabanel's literary activity covers Bible exegesis, philosophy and apologetics, in defense of the Jewish doctrine of the Messiah. In most of his writings (listed in the bibliography below), Abrabanel continuously quotes, comments and takes issue with Maimonides. He does not write a page without citing him. Maimonides is the center of most of his theological discussions, despite the many reservations Abrabanel may have about him, perhaps under the influence of his kabbalistic leanings. Of all his works, those directly of concern to us is his commentary to the Guide (Prague, 1831-1832) reprinted later in the standard editions of the Moreh Nebukhim; Answers to Saul Ha-Kohen (Venice, 1574) and Shamayim Hadashim (Roedelheim, 1828) on the creation of the world. Some of these Abrabanel began to write prior to his departure for Italy (B. Netanyahu, Don Isaac Abravanel, p. 52). Since politics and finances exhausted most of Abrabanel's time and strenghth, he had very little time for his literary activity. He had, as he tells us, to "steal time</page><page sequence="24">XLIV Jacob I. Dienstag from the day, or snatch it from the night" (Netanyahu, p. 52). On such "stolen time, he wrote his introduction to the third part of the Guide, in which he combats Maimonides' conception of angels on the basis of his own interpretation of the symbols in EzekieFs Chariot" (ibid. p. 52). Abrabanel managed to comment on part I, chapter I-LV; II, chapters XXXI-XLV of the Guide. He had also written a supplementary section to his commentary on the Guide, the above mentioned Shamayim Hadashim on part II, chapter 19, in which he sought to demonstrate from the order of the heavens the theory of creation (ex nihilo), and to coordinate that theory with Maimonides' view (ibid. 78). "The opinion of Maimonides is not always accepted. Thus twenty-seven objections are raised against his interpretation of the first chapter of Ezekiel... The commentary is followed by a short essay (Ma.'amar) on the plan of the Moreh. The method adopted by Abarbanel in all his Commentaries is also employed in this essay. A series of questions is put forth on the subject, and then the author sets about to answer them..." (M. Friedlaender, Introduction to his English translation of the Guide of the Perplexed, p. XXXII-XXXIII). While he was occupied with his general commentary on the Guide, his attention was diverted. Saul ha-Cohen Ashkenazi (1470-1523), the author of philosophical works and a disciple of Elijah Delmedigo, addressed to hims twelve philosophical queries, "particularly with a view to ascertaining the position taken by Maimonides on the questions involved. Abrabanel's answers to these queries constitute his sharpest and weightiest attack against the Averroist interpreters of Maimonides, and it is here that we find him at last relieved from the long and arduous internal struggle he had conducted with Maimonidean thought" (Netanyahu, p. 86). CRITICISM: "Abrabanel maintained an intense and ambivalent attitude towards Maimonides; he does not write a page without citing him with immoderate respect, and without criticizing him with acerbity. His three principal subjects of meditation were the creation of the world, prophecy and the principles of Judaism. On these three points he is often in accord with the letter of Maimonides' text, and in disagreement with Maimonides' thought; he is then obliged to rehabilitate the literal text whenever this is possible or to refute it word by word and phrase by phrase. His philosophical writing may be considered as an extremely precise commentary on the work of Maimonides (his original ideas are to be found in his biblical commentaries) and he most probably considered his commentary on the Guide of the Perplexed as his chief work." (C. Sirat, A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages (1985), p. 395). With the departure of Abrabanel from Spain, the curtain descended on Spanish Jewry. The Inquisition cast an increasing shadow not only over the Jews</page><page sequence="25">The Moreh Nebukhim in Pre-Expulsion Spanish XLV of Spain but also over the entire European Jewish community. The anti rationalistic currents and trends, that were spreading in Europe as a reaction to medieval scholasticism, greatly influenced Jewish thinkers as a result of the Expulsion. This sentiment was strongly echoed by Joseph Ya,avez, the noted preacher, who saw in the catastrophe God's just punishment for the fact that Jews devoted themselves more to philosophy and secular sciences than to the sacred Torah. He poured out all his anger on the philosophers in his Or ha-Hayyim. The Moreh Nebukhim, of which three editions had appeared (1480, 1551, 1553), had to wait close to two centuries for a fourth edition (Yesnitz, 1742) under the influence of the Berlin Haskalah.
