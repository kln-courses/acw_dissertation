<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEIL FLAX Fiction Wars of Art PROBABLY NONE of the professional disciplines that have emerged in the last 200 years has been less concerned with its own enabling principles than art criticism. Theories of art abound, but a general theory of the discourses on art is lacking. The reasons for the gap would themselves form a crucial chapter in the critique of art criticism that has yet to be written. However, some recent signs suggest that the situation may be about to change. The most important of these, without question, is the appearance of Michael Fried's Absorption and The- atricality: Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot. Among its other accomplish- ments, the book is a powerful demonstration that the history of art cannot be told in isolation from a critical reflection on art criticism. The very presence of Diderot instead of Greuze or David in the title of a work of art history marks a change of emphasis with profound implications. 1 But if Fried grants a greater importance to the role of art criticism than is usually the case in art history, he also assumes that the relation between criticism and art is one of mutual reciprocity. He proposes a method in which "paintings and critical texts are made to illuminate one another, to establish and refine each other's meanings." He calls on critics to "see the appropriateness to a given paint- ing or group of paintings of certain verbal formulations, stylistic devices, and rhetorical strategies.72 My contention is that Fried's model of a fully reciprocal interaction between art and art criticism, as valuable as it is for its focus on critical language, is ultimately unsatisfactory for an understanding of the relations between the two domains. Once Fried has posited the need for a critical vocabularly to "illuminate" the works of art, the momentum of the admission will, I think, eventually lead to the conclusion that art and the discourse on art stand in a subordinated rather than a reciprocal relation, with criticism holding the domi- nant position. The problem with Fried's model of a mutuality between pictures and lan- guage is that it accepts as given what is precisely at issue in any modern critical account of the learned disciplines. This is the set of ideas holding that our words and the things of the world can engage in a straightforward conversation, that objects, such as paintings, can tell us how they should be talked about, that pre- existent facts can "establish" the meanings of language, that certain verbal for- mulas have an ineluctable "appropriateness" to their referents. As a number of recent antifoundational critiques have suggested-the work of Thomas Kuhn, REPRESENTATIONS 7 * Summer 1984 ? THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</page><page sequence="2">Hayden White, Stanley Fish, Michel Foucault, and Richard Rorty can be men- tioned here-this apparent "appropriateness" of language to object can never be taken for granted. It has to be seen as the effect of a prior structuring of the field of understanding by certain rhetorical figures or tropes, agreed upon by an interpretive community, usable within a given context, but always replaceable by other tropes and other contexts. In the case of art criticism, the kinds of questions asked about the painting, the elements chosen for analysis, the selection of other paintings to relate to it, the choice of writings to "illuminate" it-all of these decisions can be shown to proceed from rhetorical modes of organizing experience, and these governing metaphors determine in advance the nature of the phenomena that the discipline will observe. If certain linguistic protocols appear to be appropriate to specific works of art, it is only because they have first constructed these works as objects in a field of inquiry. (Fried, in any case, is not alone in claiming the inherent appropriateness of a critical language; he simply expresses the tacit assumption of most art-critical writing.) To be sure, all the artifacts of human culture stand in need of interpretation. As Northrup Frye has observed, "Criticism can talk, and all the arts are dumb.... [T]here is a most important sense in which poems are as silent as statues."3 But there are different orders of inarticulacy, and even the "mutest" of written texts shares the same verbal medium with the criticism that will inter- pret it. Pictures, on the other hand, are primordially estranged from language and are thus dependent on criticism in a peculiarly radical way. The problem of the ubiquity of language posed by contemporary philosophy is compounded in the case of art criticism by the absolute reliance of pictures on an alien, nonpic- torial medium to convey a meaning and a purpose. My argument, then, is that the rhetorical prestructuring of the cognitive fields in general, and the specific dependence of pictures on an external, disparate language of interpretation should serve as the conceptual starting points for the critical study of the dis- course on art. Claims for the constitutive role of art criticism have of course been made before, especially in discussions of modern art. In their "weak" form these claims usually mean that the artist in modern culture is acutely dependent on art crit- icism to explain his innovative work to a puzzled public. In their "strong" form the claims typically mean that criticism has invaded art and become part of what the public reacts to when it visits a museum or gallery. As Stanley Cavell puts it: "In the modern situation [criticism] seems inevitable, even, one might say, inter- nal, to the experience of art.... Often one does not know whether interest is elicited and sustained primarily by the object or by what is said about the object."4 While there is an element of truth in both arguments, my position implies a quite different sense of the productive role of art criticism. Where both of the 2 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="3">cited views suggest that an inescapable art criticism is peculiar to the modern era, I would maintain that a discourse of art, in some form or other, has always been the minimum requirement for the objects of art to be received. Art criticism has assumed professional status in the West only in the past 200 years, but in any civilized culture there will be found some conventional, programmatic vocabu- lary-whether ecphrastic, ornamentalist, theological, theocratic, emblematic, representationalist, narrative, esthetic, technical, iconographic, expressivist, his- toriographical, or whatever-to make sense of the essential strangeness of pic- tures. "Art criticism" in this larger historical sense can be defined as the indis- pensible medium for the reception and construal of the pictorial arts. It determines the rules for what can and cannot be said about art at a given moment in time, selects from the range of available objects those that are conformable to the rules, and arranges these objects in a system of significant relations. It follows that in any culture with pictures, a serious engagement with art will necessarily be an engagement with what can be said about art. Cavell's nostalgia for an interest "elicited and sustained primarily by the object" is, like all yearnings for a vision without mediation, ultimately mythical. (An interest "elicited" by the pictorial work is perhaps plausible, but "sustained," no.) The task, then, for a self-critical and self-conscious art criticism would be to study the ways in which a historically variable discourse shapes the objects of art into intelligible, receivable artifacts. This is not to suggest that pictures have absolutely no control over the statements that are made about them. On a certain circumscribed level, the sort of reciprocal operations that Fried describes are undeniable. The work of art possesses an irreducible core of elements that both limit and entail the kinds of things that can be said about it. But the salient fact of art history is that people keep saying different things about the same irred- ucible core. Since the picture presumably does not change its constitution, the explanation for the variability of the discourse has to be sought in the dynamics of the discourse itself. It may be objected that it is later developments in art and not in criticism that change the way earlier works are understood. But this argument is a return to the problematic view that these later developments have by themselves estab- lished their own significance, which critical language then faithfully reflects and applies to earlier art. This is the very premise of the articulateness of pictures that needs to be questioned. The solution, of course, will not be found in an equally dubious principle of the autonomy of language. It is obvious that language evolves under the pressures of social and material reality. The issue for a self-aware art criticism is to determine how its plurally conditioned languages constitute the objects of art as items in a field of understanding. I want to illustrate the productivity of art criticism with a few selected exam- ples of French and German criticism appearing around the turn of the nine- Fiction Wars of Art 3</page><page sequence="4">teenth century. My contention is that these episodes mark the initiation of a new way of talking about pictures, and that this new vocabulary has determined the way that art has been thought about in the modern era. The modern art-critical discourse is, from the outset-, an antithetical or dualistic system; and it is specif- ically this agonistic structure that has produced the modes of receiving and eval- uating art which prevail down to the present day. Clearly, large claims are being based on few cases, and the discussion should be viewed as a prologue to more extensive studies. Many of the problems and ramifications will have to be dealt with elsewhere. But the argument should at least suggest that the discourse on art requires analysis as a discourse, with a density and a dynamic of its own. It cannot simply be accepted as the faithful, transparent record of the truth of art. As Fried's study makes clear, the story of modern art history begins with Diderot. But to understand the structure of modern art criticism, we need to recall that while Diderot's Salons were written largely in the 1760s, for private circulation in a manuscript newsletter from Paris, they did not begin to be pub- lished until the mid-1790s. This was a fateful delay, for it determined that the first appearance of the Salons would coincide with the flowering of German Romanticism. The historical "coincidence" was a crucial event for the future course of art criticism. It meant that Diderot's discourse on painting would have an initial impact in Germany at the same moment that Kant's esthetics was begin- ning to make itself felt in German writing about the arts. It is the urgency of the encounter between these two disparate vocabularies that will institute modern art criticism as a system dominated by a single global opposition. The publication of the Salon of 1765 in 1795 had a powerful effect in Ger- many. It was avidly read and discussed and reviewed by the leading figures of the intellectual world, and was translated within a year.5 But before going on to consider the enthusiastic reception, a quick summary of the key issues in the Salons, as Fried has described them, will be helpful. Diderot assumes his crucial position in the history of French art by expressing in the Salons the same basic concerns that the major artists of the period were more or less consciously strug- gling with. Briefly, the issue for both painters and viewers was a newly proble- matical sense of the status of the beholder in front of the canvas. The uneasiness expressed itself in a strong revulsion against anything in a picture that smacked of theatrical or rhetorical gestures and that put the viewer in the artificial, quasi- theatrical position of being "played to." The solution devised by the artists and welcomed by the public was what Fried, in a compelling phrase, identifies as "the supreme fiction of the beholder's nonexistence" (108). Successful pictures began to portray figures so intensely absorbed in dramatic actions or contemplative states that they seem oblivious to any possible observer. The illusion of absorption 4 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">is powerful enough for the viewer to feel actively ignored by the painting itself, and the experience of neglect becomes a source of positive pleasure, at least to the beholder who is repelled by the frontal solicitations of theatrical painting. But the solution brought new problems of its own. The beholder who is now expressly excluded from the scene of representation and who can no longer play the role of theatrical spectator is under pressure to find something, so to speak, to do with himself. And the artist discovers that in pretending to deny the exis- tence of the beholder, painting was also running up against one of its own pri- mordial conventions, which is that paintings are made to be beheld. The contra- diction marks the beginning of a dialectical struggle within French art over its own theatrical tendencies, an agon that would continue, with exceptional pro- ductivity, for the next 200 years. Fried's argument is a good deal more nuanced and complex than a brief account can convey, but the summary gives an adequate sense of the sort of issues Diderot's Salons were raising. What intrigued the German audience, however, and the Romantic authors in particular, were not merely Diderot's esthetic par- adoxes, but even more the new mode of critical response that the esthetic con- cerns seem to have evoked. In effect, Diderot's response to being ignored by the absorptive pictures was to treat them as if their existence as paintings had dis- solved. He maintained that in the most successful painting, "art and artist are forgotten. It is no longer a canvas, it is nature, it is a portion of the universe that one has before one."6 This deliberate forgetting of the canvas is what enabled Diderot's new critical method of a pretended involvement of the beholder in the depicted scene. In the words of one contemporary German reviewer, Diderot had developed a way "to spirit us magically into the scene of the action itself.?7 He entered into imaginary dialogues with the figures in the paintings. He fab- ricated extended narratives or dramatic situations around the pictures, which he could follow as if a captivated witness. He imagined promenades through the portrayed landscapes. Yet paradoxically, the fabulating method brought the described paintings to life, gave them an immediacy and presence that traditional ways of talking about pictures had not been able to do. As a fictional mode of writing, Diderot's new critical method has its own underlying literary conventions and premises. Fried comes close to identifying the major enabling fiction of the Salons, but he does not quite reach the formula that is needed to explain the favorable reception among the German Romantics. I would put it something like this: In the face of the painting's supreme fiction of the nonexistence of the beholder, Diderot did not agree simply to cease to exist. On the contrary, he responded with an equally powerful, perhaps an ulti- mately more powerful fiction, the critic's supreme fiction of the nonexistence of the painting. It is this fiction, and the counterfiction that it provoked in turn in Germany, that will establish the discursive field of modern art criticism. Fiction Wars of Art 5</page><page sequence="6">Two sections of the Salon of 1765 particularly captivated the German audi- ence as brilliant examples of Diderot's new method. The first dealt with a painting by Greuze, Une Jeune Fille qui pleure son oiseau mort, which portrays a beautiful young woman crying over aldead song bird. In his account of the picture, Diderot quickly falls into an imaginary conversation (actually a dramatic monologue) with the girl. First he tries to comfort her, then he cajoles her into admitting that the real reason for her tears is not the death of her little bird but the loss of her virginity. He recalls the seduction scene, he describes her fears and her strained relations with her mother, and he finally reassures her that her lover will not abandon her. Diderot eventually returns to explicit mention of the painting itself, but only to praise the artist for evoking a sufficiently absorbing emotional response from the beholder. In the case of the second piece, Fragonard's Coresus et Callirhoe-which por- trays a priest in ancient Greece who stabs himself at the altar rather than sacrifice the beautiful young victim he has fallen in love with-the fiction of the nonex- istence of the painting assumes an even more explicit and drastic form. Diderot claims to have missed the picture entirely at the Salon. In place of the customary description he offers a long account of the dream he purports to have had during the night following his visit to the Salon. As it turns out, the dream is a scenario- ten pages long in the Seznec edition-for the sequence of episodes leading up to the suicide shown in the painting, which Diderot continues to maintain he has never seen. Rhetorically the piece is a stunning tour de force, but again the entire scenario-fantasia has the effect of negating the existence of the canvas as such. The picture disappears before the sheer fabulating energy of the critic's response, and indeed the disappearance is announced programmatically as the basis of the beholder's "critical" activity. Diderot's esthetic of the annulled canvas would be seriously misunderstood if it were seen merely as a naive illusionism which confuses artistic representations with the reality being represented. The "forgetting" of the picture is a completely self-conscious act, calculated to reconcile two apparently contradictory demands. The beholder, in Diderot's antitheatrical esthetic, needs to forget that he is, like a theatergoer, standing in front of a contrived representation, but as a sophisti- cated student of the arts he is unable to enjoy the innocent, precritical luxury of taking the representation for reality. Diderot's solution to the dilemma is to write fiction about the picture, and ideally a fiction of his own corporeal involvement in the depicted scene. An engrossing fiction is something in which the viewer can "lose" himself and forget his status as quasi-theatrical or excluded beholder, while the patently fictitious nature of the response preserves the figmentary quality of the artistic transaction. Diderot's critical system finally assumes a certain Baroque or Borgesian quality. The painting's fiction of the nonexistence of the beholder 6 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">is answered by the beholder's fiction of the nonexistence of the painting, which grounds the fiction-producing activity of the beholder. Yet it was precisely this criticism of compounded fictionality, this self-con- sciously "ironic" play of fabrication upon fabrication, to which the German Romantic writers were infallibly attracted. The publication and translation of the Salon were followed by a remarkable series of innovative works of art criticism by the first generation of German Romantic authors. Needless to say, the spate of art-critical writings doesn't owe its existence entirely to the appearance of the Salon in 1795. But with Diderot's formidable prestige in Germany, the young Romantics did find in the Salon a strong encouragement for their self-consciously literary and poetic discussions of art. Diderot opened up new possibilities for a practice of art criticism that would be, in Walter Benjamin's sense of the term, "Kunstkritik," or criticism-as-art, a hybrid genre of writing in which the distinction between criticism and fiction would be effaced.8 Not everyone in Germany, however, was enchanted with Diderot's supreme critical fiction. Goethe, in particular, saw that the Diderotian method represented a supreme critical threat to the conception of art that he, Goethe, was trying to foster. Goethe also shared the widespread sense of the exceptional importance of the Salon, and he admired many aspects of the book. He was particularly interested in the theoretical essay that appeared together with the Salon, the Essai sur la peinture, and he published his own adaptation of parts of the Essai in the form of a dialogue between himself and Diderot. Nevertheless, a fundamental disagreement underlies the cordial reception.9 The publication of the Salon falls in the middle of Goethe's so-called "clas- sical" period and virtually all accounts of his response to the Salon have dwelled on his opposition to Diderot's programmatic "naturalism" and "moralism." The focus misses what is, I think, a far more basic issue at stake in the challenge presented by the Salon. The central issue in Diderot, as we have seen, is the problem of the beholder. What has not been recognized and what I would now propose is that the new orientation toward the beholder in the Salon brought Goethe to a double illumination: first, that Diderot had indeed isolated the fun- damental question for any possible esthetics of the visual arts, the question of what the beholder is supposed to do in front of a painted canvas (as opposed to what the painter is supposed to do to produce an important canvas); and second, that Diderot's answer to the question was essentially and fatally wrong. The two insights were immediately distilled in an essay whose importance for the future course of art criticism has, to my knowledge, never been identified, a negligence that again is due to the automatic placement of the essay under the rubric of Goethe's "classicism.'"1 Admittedly the subject of the essay was the Laocoon statue. But if we can agree to look beyond the classicist connotations of Fiction Wars of Art 7</page><page sequence="8">the subject, it will become clear that Goethe's essay "Uber Laokoon" (1798) con- stitutes the first fully articulated statement of "modernist" or "formalist" or "esthetic" art criticism, as it was later developed and refined by Pater, Denis, Fry, Meier- Graefe, Rieggl, Wollflin, Greenberg, and to some extent Fried himself. The key point is that this founding statement of modernism was produced in specific response to the provocation of Diderot's Salon. The ideas in Goethe's essay can be summarized in five major propositions. Some of them are quite familiar as the basic principles of esthetic criticism. Other parts are less well known. But as long as studies continue to appear, claiming that formalist art criticism "begins" with Ruskin or Pater or Fry, it will be helpful to review the historical materials. They suggest that the first systematic application of formal or Kantian esthetics to practical art criticism takes place in 1798, in reply to a text of 1765. (My concern here, it should be evident, is not to award credit for the invention of the esthetic method, but to describe the specific his- torical pressures under which it emerged.) Here then are the five points: 1. The picture is autonomous. The work of art is "self-sufficient, . . . complete in and of itself." Ideal subjects "have, as it were, no external relation, they repose on and in themselves."' It follows that understanding of the picture does not depend on prior knowledge of literature or mythology. The Laocoon sculptors, for example, eliminated any specific costume or attribute that would identify Laocoon as a Trojan priest, and introduced ordinary serpents instead of the sea monsters of the myth, in order to free response from literary associations and permit an independent pictorial experience. 2. Esthetic response is response to form. "Every work of art," Goethe declares, "must announce itself as such." It does so by its foregrounded formal properties. These are identified as a "selected ordering of parts," the "contraposition of varied masses," "the strongest contrasts made possible through symmetry and oppositions in slight variations" (164), "relations, gradations and oppositions of all the parts" (170). The formal elements are organized above all to "help the eye investigate the relations," and the facilitated vision "makes an intricate work intelligible" (164). Given perspicuous formal relations, even if the viewer "abstracts [abstrahiert] from the contents, sees only the most general outlines from a dis- tance," he will still find the work "an ornament and decoration to the eye" (164). (The concept "abstraction" evidently has an important place in the vocabulary of art criticism well before the vocabulary finds a set of paintings to receive with the name.) 12 3. The picture is a network of artistic decisions. Goethe, like Diderot, is still focus- ing on the question of what the beholder is supposed to do in front of the picture, as opposed to what the painter must do to make a successful picture. But he insists that one of the things the beholder must do is never to forget that he is viewing the palpable traces of artistic choices. As if in pointed reply to Diderot's 8 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">deliberate forgetting of the picture per se, Goethe at every stage of the argu- ment repeatedly uses expressions such as "the three figures are chosen ex- tremely judiciously" or "one loses oneself in astonishment at the wisdom of the artists." The remarks serve as so many reminders of the factitiousness of the art object and the problem-solving activity that produces it. They are so many barriers to the Diderotian passage beyond the made artifact. In opposition to Diderot's esthetic of the willed oubli, Goethe presents an esthetic of sustained anamnesis. 4. Beholding is simultaneous seeing and thinking. The various elements of the picture "present themselves to the beholder all together, partly to the senses, partly to the mind" (164). The perfected work of art is "both an intellectual and a sensual totality" (173). The picture is the privileged site where it is possible to see and to conceive at one and the same time. How the picture accomplishes this effect will be explained in the final thesis. Here another crucial point of opposition between Diderot and Goethe should be noted. When Diderot, in front of UneJeune Fille, forgets the painted canvas and starts to comfort the grieving girl, starts talking about her mother, her lover, and her future happiness, he may have achieved a kind of vital contact with the girl, but he has stopped seeing her. This is the issue over which the decisive polarization of the discourse on art takes place. Either the beholder reaches a state of inte- grated sensory-cognitive awareness before the picture, which requires sustained seeing of what is there on the canvas, or the beholder writes stories (or poetry, or prose-poems, or fantasias, or histories) about the picture, fabulations which, however much they may animate the idea of the picture, necessarily involve losing continuous sight of it.13 5. Syntactic organization of the picture is the basis of esthetic response. A key feature of Goethe's art criticism, as Waetzoldt has noted, is the method of locating a causal node or crux in the picture which can explain all the elements of the picture as parts of a single dynamic system. 14 In the case of the Laocoon statue, the bite of the serpent at a precise point on the flank of the father determines every detail of the father's posture and expression, which in turn determines the balancing, contrasting, and framing forms of the two sons. "The instantaneous sensation of the wound [is] the principal cause of the whole movement" (168). The idea of the causal node is by no means an innovation with Goethe. It derives from ancient Aristotelian notions of the organic unity of the work of art, and other versions of it can be found in any number of critical systems, including Diderot's. What is new with Goethe is the impact of the semiotic concerns that were developing in philosophy and esthetics through the latter half of the eigh- teenth century. This is a very large topic, but it will suffice to mention here that the semiotic debates of the Enlightenment culminated in a seminal formula by Lessing. He maintained that in order to achieve esthetic status, a literary work Fiction Wars of Art 9</page><page sequence="10">had to turn its "arbitrary signs entirely into natural signs" (that is to say, turn its words into pictures, its verbal signs into iconic signs).'5 Goethe picks up on the momentum of Enlightenment semiotic philosophy and reverses the formula for the visual arts. To achieve-the esthetic effect, a picture must turn its natural, iconic signs entirely into linguistic signs. In suggesting this, Goethe does not imply that painting should once again submit to the imperialism of the text. He suggests instead that the true integration of iconic and linguistic sign-systems occurs at the level of pictorial syntax. The picture must be organized in such a way that the act of seeing it is indistinguish- able from the syntactically organized mental operations which are (in a traditional view) crystallized in language. Such is the effect of the Laocodn statue. "This," Goethe concludes, "is a basic principle: the artist has shown us a physical effect, but he also shows us the physical cause" (168). Once the primacy of the serpent's bite is recognized, viewing the Laocoon statue can be nothing other than visibly perceiving a cause and effect relation in its complex ramifications, a relation which is inherently syntactic. The statue is a conditional sentence in stone, an occasion to think a grammatical relation and to see it at the same time.' 6 Whatever one may think of Goethe's syntactic model, it should be obvious that esthetic criticism at its origins was far from being the simplified version of formalism which concentrates exclusively on what Lionello Venturi called "pure visibility:" To be sure, the stress on visibility is crucial. Venturi's phrase echoes Goethe's own paramount pictorial value of "optimum visibility" (vollkommenste Sehbarkeit). 17 But the value of visibility gets elevated to begin with because of the enhanced cognitive and affective responses which it was supposed to provide. The esthetic project only makes sense as part of the greater Enlightenment- Romantic project, epitomized in Schiller's essay "Uber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung" (1795), for the complete reintegration of the human faculties. Presumably Diderot would have subscribed to the same enterprise. He helped launch it himself with two seminal essays, his Lettre sur les aveugles (1749) and Lettre sur les sourds et muets (1751). But for Goethe, Diderot's way of looking at pictures undermines his very goal. His critical method in the Salons is at odds with his insights into language and mind in the Lettres. When Diderot locates the cause of the young girl's tears not in the dead bird who appears in the picture (the causal node that would correspond to the serpent's bite) but in the seduction that occurred at some other time and place, he has lost the chance to think about a cause and effect relation and to see it at the same time. The dead bird becomes an allegorical or "arbitrary" sign for lost innocence and the critic's discourse loses continuous coordination with the pictorial image. From that moment the two semiotic systems, far from being integrated, start to call attention to their mutual discrepancy. 1 0 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">The debate between Diderot and Goethe coincides then with a distinction between "literary" and "formalist" art criticism that is familiar to every student of modern art history. What needs to be stressed here is that these two antago- nistic positions did not arise as autonomous methods that one day happened to find themselves in conflict with each other. As a practical technique for describing pictures, the formalist position took shape specifically to counteract the fabulat- ing approach to art. It did not appear in direct response to any new developments in art itself. Moreover, this originally antagonistic relation did not function merely as an abstract debate about the proper interpretation of art. The dialectical fric- tion between the two critical modes eventually had a profound practical effect on the way that art in the modern era has been endowed with its meanings and values. Neither of these modes is a neutral, transparent account of the picture as such; neither speaks about the art object in a vocabulary presented by the object itself. Just as Diderot's art-critical method derived from his thinking about the theater, Goethe's derived from his reflections on Kant's third Critique. And Goethe's method, for all its antifabulist impetus, is no less metaphorically grounded than Diderot's. It was not the esthetic "truth" about art but another, ultimately trium- phant fiction that rescued the work of art from its fictitious annihilation by Diderot. Goethe's saving counter-fiction can be named the even more supreme fiction of the quasi-human existence of the painting. Goethe invents a way of talking about the picture as if it were a human being. In the esthetic view, the successful work of art is a perfect humanoid: autonomous, organically unified, created, display- ing the marks of its createdness, uniting the mind and the senses, and above all communicating in the innate syntactic structures of natural language. Like a human being, it demands sustained attention and rewards it. Diderot's original question of how the beholder is to occupy himself in front of the canvas is answered by Goethe with a prescription for human self-integration. In responding to the exemplary anthropomorphic organization of the picture, the beholder augments his own humanity.'8 The story of modern art criticism, however, is not only the story of a war of fictions. It is also an account of how one of them, the esthetic fiction, came to prevail as the dominant method for understanding art in the modern era, though without ever completely eliminating its rival. In principle the Diderotian and Goethean techniques probably could have lived in peaceful coexistence with one another, as available, optional methods for talking about pictures. There is no practical reason why the individual viewer could not alternate between concen- trated analysis and fabulation, between remembering the material existence of Fiction Wars of Art 11</page><page sequence="12">the picture and forgetting it. Indeed most journalistic art criticism today is a complacent, haphazard mixture of the two styles. But for serious students of art the two methods have been incompatible from the start. This is so because the two fictions, like all ambitiofus fictions, claim to tell the truth about their objects. The critical languages are each tied to an ontology, to a theory of how the painting exists in the world, and the two ontologies are mutually exclusive. Both methods start from the recognition that the painting exists in relation to a beholder. But for one school the painting has authentic existence only when it brings the viewer to forget his position as beholder in front of a canvas; for the other school, the painting has authentic existence only when it reminds the viewer of his destiny as beholder at every point. Both methods, it should be stressed, are after the same thing: a viewing experience of maximum intensity and "presence." They differ diametrically on the question of how to get it. It is easy enough to show, with the tools of deconstruction, that once the two languages defined themselves in mutual opposition they were permanently locked in theoretical dependence on one another, with all the struggles over purity and reciprocal contamination that such binary relations entail. But I think at this point a more interesting move than the deconstructive one would be to ask how the dialogue between the two critical fictions worked to construct a history for art in the modern era. How has a vocabulary organized the objects and the events of modern art into a coherent meaningful field?'9 I turn then from the initial stage of development, in which the protocols for talking about art are established to the "productive" stage in which the discourse selects its objects and places them in meaningful relation to one another. To illustrate this latter phase I will focus on a single problematical and familiar aspect of recent art history. In virtually all accounts of modern art, the uncontested central position is occupied by the French tradition, running from Courbet and Manet through Impressionism, post-Impressionism, Cubism, and abstraction, to the various "modernist" movements that succeed it. The German tradition, by contrast, is generally accorded a peripheral position. German art has isolated flashes of unquestionable importance with the Romantics and the Expressionists, but it fails to command the dominating role that Paris occupies in the develop- ment of modern art. My concern will be to determine what role the modern discursive system has played in establishing this widely accepted model of under- standing. In focusing on this question, I do not suggest that the Germans have been unduly neglected, nor do I address the issue of why Paris became the major center for important art. I am interested instead in the languages that people use to make sense of disruptive events (a prime instance of which would be the emergence of an unfamiliar mode of art). Granted that Paris attracted a greater number of outstanding artists than any other locale in Europe, it still remains an open question how viewers would understand the art produced there 1 2 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">and in what terms they would decide its superiority to other art. These issues, I contend, could only be settled in and by the discourse on art. If, despite var- ious revisionist moves, we continue to "grant the primacy of French art as a starting point,"20 this position will only have been secured by the workings of a specific language-game, which is the language-game set in motion by Diderot and Goethe. At the heart of these workings of language is the thorny question of how a discourse establishes its connection to the objects whose meaning it will construct. To clarify this elusive relation, it may help to borrow a notion from evolutionary biology, which speaks of "pre-adaptation" in the emergence of new behavioral traits. What this notion means is that a biological feature first has to be in place before an organism can make adaptational use of it. The giraffe first has to have a long neck before it can think of eating off the tops of trees. The reverse sequence would entail a discredited Lamarckism. Human beings first have to have a cerebral cortex and a vocal apparatus able to produce articulated sounds before they can begin to speak. In this antiteleological model of evolution, the "preadapted" physical traits are supplied by the random workings of genetic mutation, without any anticipation or requirements that they will eventually prove useful or necessary. Transferring the model to the history of culture, we could say that a critical language first has to be in place before a beholder can use it to respond to a change in the artistic environment. The language itself cannot be the reflexive response to an artistic change, first because an immediate response is demanded and a new language is an exceedingly difficult and time-consuming item to pro- duce; and second, because the number of languages would become unmanage- able if every change in the artistic environment elicited a new critical method. The viewer instead runs through a repertory of already available techniques until he finds one that fits the new situation. To be sure, new languages are occasionally produced. My argument has been precisely that Diderot and Goethe invented a new discursive practice. But such events are extremely rare, are indeed, in the most literal sense, epoch-making. For the rest, talking about art is a matter of bricolage. But pictures, it may be objected, are not natural objects like the tops of trees; they are products of culture and are encoded from the outset with cultural mean- ing. This is certainly true. But the fact that all cultural products are encoded does not imply that the codes are inherent in the products themselves. The languages that make it possible to use the artifacts of culture are constructed by the culture, not compelled by the artifacts. What functions as a cooking utensil in one society may be utilized as an item of adornment in another, or in the same society at another time. The meaning of a painting is likewise indeterminate, first because the painting is partly the product of a pictorial thinking that is indepen- Fiction Wars of Art 13</page><page sequence="14">dent of verbal codes, and then because it is congenitally mute and has no way, apart from an appended text, to specify which verbal codes informed its production. The appended texts, moreover, are always detachable and replaceable. It is this primordial liability to "losirg" its text that makes art radically dependent on criticism. Once an attachment takes place, a dialectical process can ensue; dis- course and art can begin the complex chain of reciprocal influences that shape both parties to the process. But before any of these interactions can occur, an available language has to be affixed to the picture. Since pictorial thinking is perpetually generating unfamiliar forms, and since "uncoded" art from alien cultures and rediscovered art from the past are continuously invading the cul- tural environment, the work of critical annexation is open-ended. The biological model of pre-adaptation helps us to understand that no affixed language enjoys an obligatory or inevitable connection to the works of visual art it adopts; yet in a given context the "fit" of an available language to an existing form of art becomes provisionally possible. What all this means for the history of art in the nineteenth century is that the reception of contemporary art was determined by the "pre-adapted" critical languages that happened to be on hand. These were the polarized discourses created by Diderot and Goethe. The central point of my argument is that the prior polarization of the discourses in turn organized the French and the North- ern Romantic traditions into a coherent, "meaningful" relation of opposition. Beginning with Zola's defense of Manet in esthetic terms, it is essentially the Goethean critical method that stages the successful reception of French modern- ist art and its later tradition. An esthetic of visibility had to be ready and waiting for Zola to be able to say convincingly of Manet's art: "A head placed against a wall is nothing more than a whitish spot against a greyish background, and the clothing next to the face becomes, for example, a bluish spot beside a whitish spot." Or: "In the juxtaposition of these various whites, an enormous difficulty has been overcome." (Compare Goethe's stress on the values of "contraposition" and "gradation.?)21 In Germany conversely, a Diderotian criticism derived from artistic and the- oretical problems specific to France was enjoying its greatest vogue at the moment that German Romantic painting began to appear. For better or worse this was the esthetic that got to determine the "meaning" of German Romantic art. If, as we are about to see, new German painting was immediately explained as "allegorical," "transcendental," and "mystical," if it is still possible for a leading German Runge scholar to speak of the artist's work as "painterly meditations on the dissolution of a Christian-transcendental conception of God in the eternity of a limitless universe," this is because Diderot had demonstrated a way to talk about pictures as if they opened upon depths and vistas that they did not explicitly show.22 14 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">The peculiar crossover pattern of art reception in the nineteenth century is that German criticism provides the vocabulary for the understanding and accep- tance of French modernist art, while French criticism supplies the terms of understanding for German Romantic art. The grand irony of the system is that German thought, in successfully imposing its own system of values through the medium of French modernist art, inexorably establishes the marginal position of the German tradition in painting. But the two artistic traditions could be thought to stand in significant disparity only because of the oppositional nature of the two discourses with which they were first received. Subsequent attempts, such as Robert Rosenblum's, to equalize the French/German hierarchy by deny- ing the difference between the two traditions are a completely logical develop- ment within the language-game of modern art criticism. But they do nothing to explain how the game got started or why the side that "won" did. The very terms in which Rosenblum vindicates the German Romantic tradition-as proto-abstract- merely confirm the victory of the Goethean camp. Other efforts, such as Kermit and Kate Champa's, to rehabilitate German art by acknowledging the differences between the traditions are not much more helpful, since the terms in which the differences are explained are all derived from the French side. The reasons for the diversity and discontinuity of German art, in the Champa's view, are that Germany lacked a centralized academy, a dominant standard of taste, an informed, sophisticated public (the last claim is particularly dubious). The understanding of the situation is still dualistic, with Germany occupying the negative, privative pole. 23 One effect of this kind of dialectical pressure is that it tends to put artistic traditions in compulsory relation when in fact there may be no intrinsic connec- tions at all. It may be that the only thing to link German and French art in the nineteenth century is the accident of having been picked up by a critical system already structured in a binary manner. The coercive power of these structures is immense. Once they have assigned roles to individual players, it is exceedingly difficult for observers to think of the players acting in some other play. Possibly German art was miscast as the protagonist of Diderotian theory; perhaps it was typecasting from the start. We can only begin to judge when we have recognized that the dualistic language-game of modern art criticism pre-exists the art it "explains." What is certain meanwhile is that once the correlation between a discourse and a pictorial tradition has occurred, it operates as a fact of history. From the moment that German Romantic art was understood to work in a "Diderotian" manner, it was destined to stand in an oppositional relation to what- ever contemporary art the Goethean position would eventually choose to endorse. The actual process by which the critical schools and the pictorial traditions get aligned is a complicated one and requires a good deal of patient, detailed illustration. We would want to know more, for example, about how Goethean Fiction Wars of Art 15</page><page sequence="16">criticism migrated to France and positioned itself to "adopt" French modernist art. But for the moment I will have to settle for one quick example, which focuses on the somewhat less familiar territory of German art and has the additional merit of dramatizing the discursive process with exceptional clarity. This is the early reception of the work of Caspar David Friedrich in Germany. From the outset the response to Friedrich was steeped in controversy. The debates are of considerable interest since they provided the Diderotian and Goethean camps with their first opportunity to square off over the evaluation of a contemporary artist. When Friedrich's first oil painting, the so-called Tetschen Altarpiece, was exhibited in Dresden in 1808, it was immediately attacked by a disciple of the Goethean school, EWB. von Ramdohr.24 (The painting shows a large crucifix on an isolated mountain peak at sunset.) With remarkable prescience, Ramdohr recognized that this lone canvas by an unknown provincial German artist marked a turning point in the understanding of European art. In the course of a long, vigorous, and shrewd critique of the painting, Ramdohr makes the following major points: (1) The picture seeks to elicit an "allegorical" reading from the beholder, which requires going beyond what is visible in the painting. As opposed to the value of autonomy, "the allegorical interpretation of landscape must always be sought outside the painting" (148). (2) The painting's gesture beyond itself is re- enforced by the carved wooden frame that Friedrich provided. The allegorical Christian emblems on the frame encourage the viewer to meditate on the tran- scendent, timeless mysteries of the sacraments rather than engage in an imme- diate visual experience. (3) The parts of the picture stand in no coherent (read: syntactic) relation with one another. The sun (i.e. the "causal node") could not have illuminated the cross as it does if it were located where it appears to be in the painting. (4) The picture undermines optimum visibility. It offers no stable, secure viewpoint for the beholder because "the painter has not taken and could not have taken any single standpoint" in painting the scene as it is represented. (5) The picture is in a hybrid mode. It treats landscape in the manner proper to portraiture. (6) In authentic "esthetic" experience, "we are perpetually conscious of the distance from real life, and enjoy the game that art plays with our feelings" (149; emphasis mine). In sum, the painting is attacked not merely for its intrinsic artistic shortcomings, but because these alleged shortcomings elicit a non-esthetic mode of response on the part of the beholder. The Goethean critique of Friedrich's art was not long in finding its Diderotian counter-statement. The modern critical system becomes crystallized a year later with the exhibition in Berlin of Friedrich's The Monk by the Sea. (The painting portrays the tiny robed figure of a monk against a broad, flat expanse of sand, water, and sky.) It was reviewed by Heinrich von Kleist in a short essay, "Emotions Upon Viewing Friedrich's Seascape," that is as enigmatic and suggestive as the 1 6 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">famous piece on the Marionette-Theater that would appear in the same journal two months later. Kleist starts from the quintessential Diderotian position of an intolerable exclusion from the painting. The emotional experience that he expected to find in the picture intrudes itself between himself and the picture: "What I should have found in the picture I found only between me and the picture."25 He speaks of "a demand that my heart made of -the picture and a loss that the picture inflicted on me," and observes that "nothing can be sadder or more unpleasant than this position in the world" (168). The essential project then for Kleist is Diderot's project of overcoming the beholder's estrangement from the canvas by achieving some form of lived involvement or virtually physical incor- poration in the scene. In Kleistian Romantic terms, the picture elicits the desire in the viewer to put an end to representation and self-consciousness, and to achieve a condition of pure presence in the picture. As in the Marionette-Theater, Kleist's solution for the alienated beholder is to press through the utmost extreme of artifice in order to fall back into the state of nature. Paradoxically, literature intervenes to effect the breakthrough. The critic imagines that the picture is spread before him "like the Book of Revelation" and "as if it were dreaming Young's Night Thoughts." A book dreams of a book and suddenly the beholder stands in direct, unmediated contact with the picture itself. In Kleist's stunning phrase, "it seems as if one's eyelids had been cut away." The line is often quoted but is rarely understood to be the turning point in the story of the beholder's relation to the painting that Kleist is narrating. Think- ing about the painting as if it were literature is the magical gesture that overcomes the fatal separation of beholder and canvas. Once the breakthrough to a desired presence has occurred, the familiar Diderotian system of annulled canvas and writerly fabulation comes into full play. Rather than contemplate the image before him, the critic begins to imagine alternative versions of it. He suggests that if the painter were merely to paint a square mile of sand with a barberry bush and a lone crow it would "create a truly Ossian or Kosegarten effect"-a further lit- erary amplification, with the latter name referring to an eighteenth-century Ger- man author of melancholy landscape poetry. But in a final twist that rivals Dider- ot's most daring critical conceits, Kleist imagines that if Friedrich had painted this same scene "with its own chalky sand and its own water, then I believe one could bring the foxes and the wolves to howl, without doubt the strongest thing one can propose in praise of this type of landscape painting" (168). The final consummation of Diderotian response is imagined as a sheer animal absorption in the painting, an absorption so primal that it could only be articulated by a subverbal howling (though this is a howling from critical foxes and wolves who are understood to be the close relations of Kleist's fencing bear, that super-bear of preternatural intelligence in the essay on the Marionette-Theater). Whatever the gist of Kleist's ironic play with foxy critics, the important point Fiction Wars of Art 17</page><page sequence="18">is that his defense of Friedrich concludes in exactly the same way as Ramdohr's attack. Both writers see the key issue in modern painting as the type of response elicited from the beholder. Friedrich's art is valued by Kleist for the very reason that it is attacked by Ranidtnr: its apparent tendency to evoke allegories or alternative versions of itself in the imagination of the beholder. But beyond the antithetical valuations, both critics have turned the painting into the same testing ground for the authenticity of the beholder's response. The implications for the future system of art criticism are profound. Wherever the formalist-fabulist dichotomy takes hold, the picture will thereafter be judged on whether or not it prompts the other or "wrong" kind of critical reaction. For the formalist camp, bad art will be art that tempts the viewer into fictional speculations; for the literary camp, bad art will be art that only wants to be seen. The rejected response of each critical position is precisely the touchstone of value for the opposing position. Friedrich's art thus has its meaning and worth defined by the position that both critical camps have "agreed" to assign it within their pre-existent, polar- ized field of discourse. The major problem with the system is that no art is intrinsically more suscep- tible to one approach than to the other. Diderot's fantasias on Vernet's landscapes, and the large body of fabulating German Romantic criticism on landscape art, belie the notion that Impressionist landscape painting, for example, "required" a formalist reading as opposed to a literary interpretation. It thus became all the more urgent for each of the critical camps to capture a new and possibly impor- tant style of art as quickly as possible for its own side, and to cancel out the essential tractability of the art. The history of painting over the past 200 years could be told in terms of the struggles for appropriation, the obligatory deval- uations of art successfully appropriated by the opposite side, and even the refus- als to appropriate which can work just as powerfully to efface the object's initial neutrality. These contests are not restricted to new art alone. They can also occur over rediscovered art from the past. Michael Fried's seizure of Greuze and Vernet for the modernist tradition, for example, was a brilliant blow against the revisionist critics who have been trying to construct a significant counter-modernist tradi- tion in nineteenth-century art by rehabilitating neglected anecdotal and narrative painting from the Salon and the Academy. But Fried's move is necessarily an ambiguous one. Even as he construes the disputed art in a contrary manner, Fried confirms that pictures are essentially malleable, and depend on a currently prevailing critical dialogue in order to assume a visibility and a meaning. This, then, is the agonistic model that I believe can clarify the history of art reception in the past two centuries. It applies no less accurately to other contro- versies in the art world. The debates over the Tetschen Altarpiece and The Monk by the Sea are replayed in the disagreement between Baudelaire and Zola in the 1 8 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="19">1860s over the proper understanding of Manet. They are replayed in Michael Fried's celebrated attack on Minimal Art in 1967, which used what was being said and written about Minimal Art as the basis for the indictment.26 Interestingly enough, those writings were distinctly Diderotian in character, while Fried's attack was overtly formalist. (Fried, if I have understood him correctly, has now taken a more skeptical view of the inexorable progress toward abstract art than the standard accounts of modernity espouse. And his study of Diderot rests on the paradoxical insight that it was Diderot's "literary" art criticism that staked out the essential problematics of a "formalist" enterprise in Western art. But despite these important qualifications, Fried remains firmly committed to the value of that enterprise. What he is seeking to change are the terms in which it is understood, from simply formalist and naively teleological ones, to more complexly beholder- oriented and ontological ones. The modernist lineage constructed and hallowed by formalist criticism remains intact, while Fried endows it with a new set of meanings.) The continuity of the modern critical system is seen again in the current debate between "modernists" and "postmodernists," which appears to be shaping up as the major organizing conflict for contemporary cultural criticism. It is no surprise that the values of "allegory," "hybrid forms," "syntagmatic disjunction," "obliteration of boundaries;" and the wish "to blur the distinction between liter- ature and criticism" figure heavily in the defense of postmodern art.27 Con- sciously or not, the advocates simply adopt the inevitable Diderotian and Ger- man-Romantic vocabulary in order to mark out a territory in contemporary art that can stand in perceivable opposition to the art that has already been appro- priated by formalism. The stability of the rhetorical system is such that even the classic "Rosenblum ploy" gets repeated, as one writer argues that postmodernism is, after all, not the antithesis of modernism but just an alternative version of it, an "allegory" of modernism.28 While postmodernist criticism may believe itself to be charting new paths for modern art, the language it uses infallibly assimilates the art to a familiar structure of understanding. The persistence of the same oppositional structure suggests that it provides an eminently usable method for constituting meanings. And indeed a longer view of art history will show that at least since the seventeenth century, European art criticism has been organized as a sequence of large quarrels: the Ancients against the Moderns, the Rubenists against the Poussinists, Ingres' linearists against Delacroix's colorists, the Romantics against the Realists, and so on. One reason why the Goethe-Diderot antinomy came to dominate modern art criticism so effectively is that the audience had been deeply conditioned over centuries to think about art as a matter of grand antagonisms. Whatever the cognitive advan- tages and disadvantages of this dualistic system, it has evidently worked as a highly efficient mechanism for making it possible to talk about art. By dividing the field Fiction Wars of Art 19</page><page sequence="20">of painting into two contending camps, the critic gives himself something to say. He can argue for the assignment of an individual picture or artist to one of the two camps. He can identify those elements in the art that support the assignment, and thereby confirm the- iwlidity of the antithesis that first enabled the assign- ment. He can apply a set of positive and negative values to the two poles of the binary pair. Or he can rediscover the fact that the two members of the couple are mutually dependent on one another for their conceptual existence, and call for a re-evaluation of the "devalued" side. The problem to address would be to trace the logic and the paradoxes of this system for the production of critical discourse as. it develops in time. Art lovers may object that in taking such a long view we evade our respon- sibility, as Cavell has described it, to judge the "authenticity" or "fraudulence" of the art of our time with the only set of values available to us. But in formulating such judgments, we evade our responsibility to think historically about the values we are using, which is to conceive the larger history of discourses, vocabularies, language-games, and the like. This is another insoluble dilemma of mind that we will have to learn to live with. If my analysis is persuasive, it would follow that the language of art criticism should be viewed as inherently detachable from the art it refers to, rather than as inherently attached to it. The best example of this essential replaceability is provided by the birth of formalist art criticism. Goethe chose to introduce his new method with a work of art, the Laocodn statue, that was ideally suited to a literary fabulation in the manner of Diderot. If this traditional epitome of "lit- erary" art could be won over to a formalist reading, then Diderot's critical method faced a formidable rival. The important issue then is to determine how intrin- sically detachable vocabularies assume their provisional attachment to their objects. How did the formalist reading of Laocoin, or of Manet's Olympia, come to seem more convincing than any of the alternative accounts? Why did formalist criticism triumph over the literary method as the primary agency for the reception of modern art? There are no quick answers to these questions. We can, to be sure, identify some contributing factors. The great success of the formal method is certainly due in part to its phenomenal adaptability. It has proven applicable not only to virtually every type of painting, but also to primitive artifacts, pieces of furniture, and objects from nature-a distinct competitive advantage in the age of the encyclopedic museum. And clearly Goethe's esthetic approach was much more teachable and practicable by large numbers of viewers than Diderot's technique, which would be difficult to reduce to a system. But it is doubtful whether any such sociological explanation will be entirely adequate to the events. I would want to ask instead whether the triumph of formalist criticism was not in some measure due to the sheer, raw, nonverbal power of the French experimental art it was 20 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="21">fortunate enough to "adopt." Was it Manet, in effect, who secured Goethe's vic- tory over Diderot? While formalist criticism was effectively ascribing a set of meanings to modernist art, was some mute, untouched, inarticulable potency in the art meanwhile carrying this ascribed language to an otherwise inaccessible prominence? The idea is admittedly speculative, but it helps to account for the fact that while Goethe's formal method was available from the early years of the nineteenth century, it did not begin to see widespread use for another seventy or eighty years, when it began to be used to interpret Impressionist art. Given the method's enormous potential utility, the delay requires some explanation. Perhaps its even- tual triumph simply awaited the appearance of a type of art that was unfamiliar enough to escape automatic association with one of the prevailing critical modes, and was thus open to appropriation by a new vocabulary. Once the linkage had occurred, modernist art itself would then propel the attached language to its new success. This model would imply that the relation of language and painting is, after all, an interactive one, though not at all the necessary and transparent interaction that a mirror-theory or lamp-theory of critical discourse would like to believe. It is rather an occluded and contingent connection, in which a voiceless art allies itself with an available language in order to make its presence felt, and the lan- guage then assimilates the art to a pre-established system of meanings. But this claim for a sort of dialectical opacity between language and art does not mean to suggest that art criticism ought to cease. On the contrary, my argu- ment is that without it we could not look at pictures. What I do submit is that a self-conscious discipline of art history would need to study the languages that make the viewing of pictures possible. Such a study would necessarily be some- thing like a theory and a history of fiction. Notes 1.

A.D. 250), which was widely used by artists in the Renaissance. Ecphrasis often favors narration to describe paintings. But the narratives generally recount the mythical material illustrated in the picture rather than invent ad hoc stories. More important, they do not involve the Diderotian fiction of the beholder's active partic- ipation in the depicted scene. 7 Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, Intelligenzblatt 66 (June 1, 1796), cols. 548-49.

Even Otto Stelzer's Die Vorgeschichte der abstrakten Kunst (Mtinchen, 1964), a classic of the "inevitable march of history toward abstraction" school, fails to mention the essay in question. 11.

The reader without German is cautioned against using the badly mangled anonymous English translation in Goethe on Art, ed. John Gage (Berkeley, 1980). Although the topic of Goethe's essay is a statue, the esthetic principles apply to painting as well. I will therefore continue to use "picture" or "painting" in discussing the general appli- cation of Goethe's theory. For an example of the same method applied to landscape painting without human subjects see Goethe's essay "Ruysdael als Dichter" [1816], Schriften zur Kunst, pp. 670 -76. 12. To be sure, Diderot also acknowledges the classical Renaissance pictorial values of light and dark, composition, color, line, and unity, and he has some very perceptive comments on light and dark as a unifying medium. But formal qualities remain a necessary preliminary to his chief concern with the dramatic and emotive effects of painting: "Painting is the art of reaching the soul through the medium of the eyes. If the effect stops at the eyes, the painter has only travelled half the road." Salon of 1765 in Salons, eds. Jean Seznec and Jean Adhemar (Oxford, 1960), vol. 2, p. 174, my translation. Goethe would reply that the ambulatory and sequential metaphor is misconceived. The great painter, he insists, reaches the soul without ever ceasing to address the eyes. The formal elements for Goethe remain constitutive throughout the beholding experience. 13. The esthetic project for uniting the sensory and the intellectual faculties is a response to classical faculty psychology, according to which the physical senses and the intel- lectual powers are divided and relatively independent. The great message of German esthetic philosophy is that the unity of the disparate faculties can be restored in the experience of art. See the illuminating essays by Jeffrey Barnouw, "The Morality of the Sublime: Kant and Schiller," Studies in Romanticism 19 (1980), 497-514; and "The Morality of the Sublime: To John Dennis," Comparative Literature 35 (1983), 21-42. It may be asked whether a literary response couldn't in principle achieve the same desired objective. The answer would have to be a pragmatic one. If fictionalizing criticism could do this, Goethe would have no quarrel with it. But in practice the Diderotian critic is not going to pay prolonged attention to the visible image, because he values pictures precisely to the extent that they know how to efface their own materiality. Goethe's dispute, in other words, is less with literary art criticism per se than with its basic presuppositions about the nature of the pictorial enterprise. 14.

Extending Fried's helpful discussion (pp. 85 - 87), a development in theories of caus- ality in painting can be traced as follows: Classical Renaissance theory understands unifying causes as "ostensible occasions for the action or expression of individual figures or groups of figures" (85). Diderot substitutes an idea of the unifying cause Fiction Wars of Art 23</page><page sequence="24">as a "determinism" (86) or "absolute necessity" (87) found in the inexorable laws of nature. Goethe vehemently opposes Diderot's idea and disputes it at length in Diderots Versuch uiber die Malerei (Schriften zur Kunst, 206 -18). Against the notion that art par- allels or embodies the laws of nature, Goethe maintains that artists "ultimately create the rules out of themselves, according to the laws of art, which lie as truly in the nature of the creative genius as universal Nature, eternally active, keeps the organic laws" (208). Goethe was irrevocably opposed to the subjection of art to any external determinism, but he also wanted to maintain the classical view of the art object as a unified system of causes and effects. Syntactic unity provided him with the ideal solution. Syntax has regulatory powers as binding as the laws of nature, but it is a pure expression of human mentality. The historical development runs then from a temporal to a naturalist to a linguistic model of pictorial unity. 17. Goethe, "Heidelberg [1816]" Schriften Zur Kunst, p. 694. 18. In evaluating Diderot's and Goethe's art criticism, it should finally be stressed that regardless of their differences the two authors collaborate in bringing about a major paradigm shift in Western thinking about art. They effect a change from what the Germans call "Maler-Aesthetik" or "painter's esthetic," with its traditional values of verisimilitude, expression, accuracy of drawing, perspective, anatomy, drapery, etc., to a beholder's esthetic which, however it is conceived, does not imagine itself as coinciding with the technical concerns of the artist. One needs to read very little art criticism before Diderot's to recognize the magnitude of the breakthrough he and Goethe achieved in displacing the academic model of the viewer as an inspector who runs through a checklist of standardized items in order to certify that the artist has mastered the techniques of his metier. Goethe's formalism is in effect an attempt to develop a vocabulary that is specific to the beholder while still taking account of the problem-solving activity of the artist. 19. My account leaves out a third major strand in the modern discourses on art, academic art history. In interesting ways that would need to be treated elsewhere, professional art history grows out of the German esthetic movement but quickly finds ways to accommodate the fabulating imperative, whether through historiography, or icon- ology, or sociology, or psychology. Since my primary concern is with the reception of contemporary art in the nineteenth century, I am limiting my remarks to the two decisive discourses. For similar reasons, I omit any discussion of the realist critical school, which for a while played a major role in discussions of contemporary art but was thoroughly routed by the esthetic method. On the origins of historicism in esthetic philosophy, see Peter Szondi, "Poetik und Geschichts-philosophie: Zu Schillers Abhandlung Uber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung," in Geschichte: Ereignis und Erzdh- lung, eds. Reinhart Koselleck and Wolf-Dieter Stempel, Poetik und Hermeneutik 5 (Munchen, 1973), pp. 377-410. On the helplessness of realist criticism to deal with the work of Manet, see T.J. Clark, "Preliminaries to a Possible Treatment of Olympia in 1865," in Frascina and Harrison, eds., Modern Art, pp. 259-73. 20. Kermit S. Champa and Kate H.

These factors are certainly relevant, but they do not explain why the public, both sympathetic and disapproving, should decide to understand the new religious art as negating its own material presence, or how, given the decision, it found at its disposal a suitable vocabulary to talk about pictures in this way. 23.
