The Subject Fields With this list we bring to a close the series of references on instruction in the elementary school. The series be- gan in the October issue with refer- ences on the curriculum, evaluation, and supervision. In the November is- sue, specialists offered items on foreign languages in the elementary school, the language arts, the library program, and the social studies. In this issue, special- ists survey current materials in arith- metic, science, music, art, and health and physical education. Arithmetic MAURICE L. HARTUNG University of Chicago 1. Ausubel, David P.

Burns, Paul C., and Yonally, James L. "Does the Order of Presentation of Numerical Data in Multi-Steps Arith- metic Problems Affect Their Diffi- culty?" School Science and Mathematics, LXIV (April, 1964), 267-70. In this minor investigation of the hitherto unanswered question indicated by the title the answer was yes. However, the small sample of students (N = 95) and the low reliability of the tests leave the answer still somewhat in doubt. 4. Capps, Lelon Roger. "A Comparison of the Common Denominator and In- version Method in Teaching Division of Fractions," Journal of Educational Research, LVI (July-August, 1963), 516-22. A careful investigation of a traditional topic in arithmetic with results not uni- formly in favor of the "common denomi- nator" method, which was increasingly popular up to comparatively recent times. 5.

Experiment 163</page><page sequence="2">164 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL December 1964 deals with seriation, serial correspond- ence, and ordinal correspondence.
