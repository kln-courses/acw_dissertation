<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CL I F FORD ANDO Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics Augustine had no theory of signs . Indeed, one might properly say that Augustine had no philosophy of representation, no critique of idolatry, and no theory of time. This is not to say that Augustine did not think about language, or that in doing so he did not incur debts to earlier essays on the nature and origin of signs.1 Rather, Augustine confronted signs and the failings of language, and sought to explain the referential capacity of religious art, in response to contingen- cies that were, for him, embedded in philosophical and theological debates. These debates are now the subject of discrete modern discourses whose presuppositions Augustine would reject. The objects of Augustine’s inquiry, and of modern inquiry into Augustine, are rarely the same. In the  rst years of the  fth century church and state moved with ever greater resolve against the remnants of Greco-Roman paganism, and Augustine as bishop cooperated in the policies of the institutions that ordered his world. That he did so should not, however, allow the philosophical basis of his critique of pagan idols and classical texts to remain unexplored.2 For Augustine, if pagan culture were to be wrong, it had to be wrong for a reason. Challenged in daily converse and by daily experience to explain his distinction between true and false religion and true and false religious practice, Augustine ultimately argued that signs served diVerent functions in pagan and Christian life because pagans and Christians sought access to aspects of creation that possessed diVerential ontological statuses and that had, therefore, diVerent places in late classical metaphysics. But by casting a religious debate in shared philosophical language, Augustine had somewhat uneasily to de- scribe a problemof religious faith in intellectual terms. Again and again, the pursuit of signs and idols led him to a fact for which traditional metaphysics could not account and that traditional language could not describe, the fact of Christ. It was an impasse that Augustine broke by an argumentative sleight of hand: it was the truth of the incarnation, he insisted, that revealed the de ciencies of classical meta- physics and the frailty of human language. If Augustine confronted the metaphysics of representation in order to solve a religious problem through reason, signs them- Re pr e se ntat ions 73 · Winter 2001 q the regent s of the un ivers i ty of ca l i forn ia i s s n 0734-6018 pages 24–53.

Augustine’s achievement emerges with particular clarity when we contrast his workwith contemporaneousChristian critiquesof idolatry, which exhibit a singular lack of re ection on the nature and function of religious art, let alone on its relation- ship to other forms of representation in religious texts and contexts.3 A quick review of those critiques reveals the depth of Augustine’s engagement with pagan theories of religious ritual and the role of idols in it. This engagement forced him to confront the super cially similar function that signs and symbols played in Christian ritual. Augustine responded by turning to metaphysics. Arguing that material objects and spoken signs possess similar metaphysical status, he likened the use of symbols in worship to the function of metaphor in religious texts. Augustine’s appropriation of a theoretical framework arising from Platonic philosophy required that he ac- count for the de ning fact of Christian history, the presence in Christ of God and man. He met this challenge by asserting the discontinuity of Christian and pagan philosophy. As God had intervened in human history, so Augustine’s new faith had an epistemologicalbasis and rested upon a theological andmetaphysical framework that could not and should not be defended with the language and arguments of earlier error. The Material Basis of All Superstition Although the conversion of the emperor Constantine in the second de- cade of the fourth century had seemed to place the coercive power of the govern- ment at the disposal of the church, he took little action against temples and images as such beyond depriving them of some state income.4 He did, however, remove innumerable cult statues from precincts throughout the East in order to decorate his new capital on the Bosphorus. Constantine was probably motivated only by greed; Eusebius, on the other hand, was happy to interpret his action in a religious light: ‘‘Those suVering from superstition then at last learned to think properly, when the emperor held up their baubles to the laughter and mockery of all beholders.’’5 Constantine’s action, and Eusebius’s reaction, largely set the terms in which the matter would be treated in the decades to follow. Prudentius, for example, argued that pagan statuary, once divorced from any sacri cial context, would simply be- come secular artwork: thus would the works of great artists become themost beauti- ful ornaments of his homeland.6 Even some pagans wrote bitterly in these terms. The poet and grammarian Palladas of Alexandria acknowledged that statues of the pagan gods survived in late-fourth-century Egypt only if wealthy Christians preserved them as works of art: ‘‘The inhabitants of Olympus, having become Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 25 </page> <page sequence="3"> Christians, live here undisturbed; for the melting pot will not put them in the  re, turning them into useful pocket change.’’7 For their part, Christians of the fourth century revealed their diminishing un- derstanding of pagan religious sentiment when they insisted that the destruction of idols or the cessation of seductive rituals would bring an end to paganism altogether. Julian the Apostate anticipated the foolishness of this approach as early as the win- ter of 362/363. In that season hewrote fromAntioch to the priestTheodorus, insist- ing that only the foolish believed idols of the gods to be unbreakable merely because they were idols: they were still the work of human hands, and could be destroyed by human hands.8 Two decades later, in his oration pro templis of 386, Libanius opposed such Christians with a diVerent argument. He insisted that while pagan rituals, images, and temples were expressive of, and focal points for, religious senti- ment, they were not constitutive of it. Their destruction would, therefore, no more guarantee an end to pagan belief than an individual’s participation in Christian ritual guaranteed his or her commitment to the Christian faith.9 In spite of the sophistication of this plea, in early July 399, Arcadius and Honorius ordered the destruction of pagan temples in the countryside, on the grounds that their oblitera- tion would simultaneously destroy the material basis of all superstition (‘‘His enim deiectis atque sublatis omnis superstitioni materia consumetur’’).10 In fact, North Africa had reached a crisis point some months prior to the pro- mulgation of the law we call Theodosian Code 16.10.16. On 19 March 399, the counts Gaudentius and Jovius tore down the temples of Carthage and broke their idols. Looking back across nearly three decades at that event, Augustine asked, ‘‘Who did not see how much the cult of the Christian name had grown, how many of them had become Christians’’ since that fateful year.11Why did Augustine think that the mere destruction of idols had had such an eVect? What did he understand the function of idols in pagan worship to be? And did he have occasion to respond to an argument like that put forward by Libanius, that idols were physical symbols used in pagan ritual, rather than the recipients of pagan worship itself ? ‘‘You and I know that it is a stone’’: A Dialogue with the Idolators Augustine confronted idolatry and idolators on several occasions throughout his career. Although he rarely names the pagans whom he refutes, he nevertheless often casts his critique of idolatry in the form of a response to critics of Christianity or apologists for pagan practice.12 If we take Augustine at his word, then studying his quotations of his opponents might allow us to re ne our under- standing of philosophical paganism in this period.13 At the same time, the dialogue had a long tradition in philosophicalwriting in largemeasure because of the rhetor- ical tools it placed in the hands of the author and its corresponding suppression of 26 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="4"> logical rigor. It therefore enjoyed a new life among late-fourth-century homilists precisely because it allowed preachers to highlight the essentials of their faith by contrast with some  ctive other, while often blurring or ignoring subtle or contro- versial points of doctrine.14 The proposition that Augustine found easiest to refute was the assertion that pagan and Christian rituals were analogous in form and, therefore, also in the doc- trine that each expressed. For example, late in the 390s Augustine wrote a long refutation of Faustus the Manichee. Faustus had labeled Christianity a mere schism of paganism because Christians held love-feasts in place of sacri ces and prayed to martyrs instead of idols.15 Less than a decade later, in the great sermon of 1 January 404 published by Franc ̧ois Dolbeau,Augustine represented a pagan drawing a sim- ilar analogy between pagan and Christian practice: just as there were bad Chris- tians who worshiped the columns and pictures of churches, so there were unsophis- ticated pagans who worshiped the idols themselves, rather than the realities that those idols represented.16 Augustine disposed of this criticism simply by admitting it: he often acknowledged the existence of nominal Christians who continued their superstitious practices or who revered tombs and pictures.17 He even begged his audience on that day to cease its adoration of such things ‘‘lest, when we insult the pagans, we give cause for the pagans to insult us.’’18 But this ready admission regarding ignorant Christians masked more serious philosophical problems. Later in his refutation of Faustus, Augustine observed that the Manichaeans and others accused the Christians of worshiping Ceres and Bac- chus because of the role played by bread and wine in Christian ritual.19 This charge, which was clearly based on the observation and interpretation of Christian ritual independent of its etiological myth, must have stung because Augustine himself practiced precisely this mode of investigation and criticism. For example, in a hom- ily contemporary with the books against Faustus, Augustine berated his audience for celebrating the birthday of Carthage in a public feast for the Genius of the city. Had they not known that they were practicing idolatry? It is no god, someone says, because it is the genius of Carthage. As though, were it Mars or Mercury, it would be a god. But learn how it is regarded by them: not for what it is [sed quomodo ab ipsis habeatur, attende: non quid sit]. For you and I know that it is stone. . . . But they regard [the genius] as a numen, and they accept that statue in the place of the numen; the altar testi es to this. What is the altar doing there, if the genius is not regarded as a numen? Let no one tell me, ‘‘It is not a numen; it is not a god.’’ I have already said, ‘‘Would that they knew this, as we all do.’’ But that altar testi es to their belief concerning the genius and the statue and to their practice. It convicts the minds of those who worship it; let it not convict those who recline before it.20 Note that Augustine did not respond to Faustus and others by arguing that they had misinterpreted Christian ritual, as though it were subject to modes of interpre- tation similar to those applied to pagan rituals. On the contrary, Augustine re- sponded by insisting that Christian bread and wine were not symbols of the Chris- Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 27 </page> <page sequence="5"> tian god, as they were of Ceres and Bacchus among the pagans, nor did Christians resemble the Manichaeans in regarding the objects themselves as holy. ‘‘Our bread and wine are not created thus, as if Christ were con ned in stalks of grain or in vines, as the Manichaeans idiotically maintain, but our bread and wine become mysticus through ritual consecration.’’21 We can now re ne the questions we asked of Augustine a fewmoments ago.What is it about the act of representation, broadly construed, that separates the Christian and pagan idolator, such that the Christian is merely an errant Christian while the pagan is, well, a pagan?22 For instance, Au- gustine could surely not have drawna metaphysical distinction between pagan idols as painted wood and Christian paintings as painted plaster, any more than he could have between bread and bread or wine and wine. So where did the diVerence lie? Did it lie with the referential capacity of the images—a possibility seemingly ren- dered impossible by the status of their raw materials—or with the status of their respective referents? Augustine did not explicitly cast this problem in metaphysical terms, so we can best approach it by asking three subsidiary questions. First, what was the recipient of pagan worship, the idol itself or something antecedent to it? Second, what eVect did this worship have on its practitioner? And, third, how was Christian practice diVerent? But let us  rst fashion a vocabulary with which to discuss this problem by ignoring precisely that distinction between Christian and pagan worship that Augustine wished so rigidly to maintain. We can do so by consulting in the  rst instance texts written between 399 and 404, the years between the destruction of the idols of Carthage and the great New Year’s sermon. We should, however, be aware that the vocabulary of worship, like the distinction between belief and ritual expressions of belief, remained a topic of interest to Augustine throughout his life.23 In his refutation of Faustus, Augustine had  rst argued that the vocabulary and forms of worship discussed by Faustus—namely, temple, altar, and sacri ce—had originally belonged to the worship of the true God and had merely been appropri- ated and corrupted by the false and lying gods.24 Augustine argued that the rituals observed in honoring martyrs were not an expression of belief in the divinity of martyrs and, therefore, not worship of them as such. Rather, altars had been estab- lished at the tombs of martyrs ‘‘to the God of the martyrs, in the memory of the mar- tyrs.’’ Augustine then lamented that Latin lacked a word for that worship that be- longs to God alone and oVered Greek latreia as its appropriate signi er.25 Although Augustine elsewhere continued to bemoan the poverty of Latin, in his sermons he described ritual as the simultaneous expression of honor toward one thing and worship toward another using the terms adoro and colo, which we may translate ‘‘to venerate’’ and ‘‘to worship.’’26 It is almost certain that Augustine learned this vocabulary from Varro’s Divine Antiquities or his essay on worship, texts that lay the foundation for allegorizing interpretations of statuary in the Latin tradition.27 To return, then, to the  rst question, regarding the recipient of pagan worship: Augustine occasionally accused pagans of worshiping the idols themselves. This, of 28 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="6"> course, was to worship a created thing rather than the Creator. In a rhetorical cre- scendo in a sermon delivered in Carthage in the winter of 403/404, Augustine asked his audience to listen to our God speaking through the prophet: ‘‘Since all the gods of the pagans are demons, God made the heavens,’’ where the demons are not worthy to live. In one place the prophet mocks the demons; elsewhere he insults their images. How does he insult their images? ‘‘The images of the pagans are of silver and gold.’’ He did not want to say stone and wood, but he put forth to be mocked that which they consider valuable, which they think precious: ‘‘Of silver and gold,’’ indeed, but nevertheless ‘‘the works of human hands.’’ What did the man do? Did he create the gold? Did he create the silver? God made these. What did the man do? ‘‘They have eyes and do not see.’’ Thus man has made into a god this thing which he made, because he would not have in that role the God by whom he was made.28 In making this accusation, Augustine read the pagan ritual literally, such that ven- eration and worship were necessarily directed toward the same object. But Augustine knew of more sophisticated pagans who distinguished between veneration of an idol as ritual and the worship that such ritual concretized. That this understandingof pagan ritual appeared as early as Plato has not stoppedChris- tians, ancient or modern, from viewing paganism as the sum of innumerable ritual actions.29 This super cial view surely lay behind the insistence that paganism had a material basis that could be destroyed. Augustine thus cautioned his congrega- tion against those pagans who say, ‘‘ ‘We know that the idols are lifeless, but we do not worship them.’ And when you ask, ‘What do you worship?’ They respond, ‘The numina of these images. We venerate what we see, but we worship what we do not see’ ’’ [Adoramus quidem quod uidemus, colimus autem quod non uidemus].30 Or, in another formulation, ‘‘We do not worship idols, but that which is signi ed by the idol.’’31 To this argument Augustine also had a ready response, that anything signi ed by an idol was also a created thing and no more deserving of worship than the idol itself. This was true regardless of whether the referent was a visible substance or physical body, like the sun, moon, or earth, or an invisible abstraction like life, ingenuity, or justice.32 In another passage from his sermon on 1 January 404, Au- gustine corrected another  ctive interlocutor: ‘‘When IworshipMercury,’’ he says, ‘‘I worship talent. Talent cannot be seen; it is something invisible.’’ We readily concede that talent is something invisible [aliquid inuisibile], and insofar as it is invisible it is something better than sky, or earth or sea or anything visible. Indeed, invisible substances [substantia inuisibilis], such as life, are better than every visible substance, since everything visible is a physical thing [quia omne uisibile corpus est], and talent is indeed a great thing. Nevertheless, if you were to consider that talent which they say they worship, what does it do? For do not many with great talent err? Perhaps they err greatly who think that talent is to be worshiped using an image of Mercury.33 But we should consider the form of this argument further, for in distinguishing veneration and worship the pagans have insisted on an allegorical reading of their Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 29 </page> <page sequence="7"> ritual actions: the veneration points beyond the literal meaning of their action even as the idol points beyond itself to another, more complex reality. Of course, these allegories did not free the pagans from their wretched error, because their own interpretations proved that they still worshiped created things. What is more, the language that I have deployed, that of reading rituals, of semiotics and allegory, is not my importation to an ancient debate but the language of Augustine himself. Thus Augustine described pagan allegories of both mythological stories and idols as ‘‘interpretations,’’ in which he once again followed Varro.34 Augustine’s diction suggests that we can reconstruct the theory of representation underlying his critique of idolatry by studying analogous problems in his philosophy of language, a course of action to which we shall return.35 ‘‘The work of human hands’’: Signs and Symbols in Christian Worship Augustine’s continued criticism of themetaphysical status of pagan idols and pagan gods urges us to question more deeply the indulgence he granted to Christian veneration ofmartyrs and tombs, pictures and columns.Why did he priv- ilege the one and condemn the other? We have seen that pagan allegories, by pointing to created things, exposed themselves to demolition. But Augustine’s criti- cism proceeded still further. It would have been bad enough to worship a rock. But looking within or beyond the rock for an invisible numen created an opportunity for demons to give the deluded pagans precisely what they wanted. ‘‘If they were only worshiping idols,’’ Augustine argued, ‘‘as the idols would not help them, so they would not hurt them. But if you venerate and serve demons, they themselves will be your masters.’’36 And what do the demons want? ‘‘Not to dominate others for eternity, but that they should be damned for eternity along with their victims, as a wicked bandit is accustomed to name an innocent man as his accomplice.’’37 Thus the allegories of more sophisticated pagans merely played into the hands of demons, who led them still further astray. So, for example, the anthropomor- phism common to pagan idols seduced the multitude because idols that resembled living bodies seemed capable of housing an invisible numen, thus creating ‘‘the vilest condition of error.’’38 ‘‘This state of mind among men invites the evil demons to take possession of the statues of the pagans, and the errors of those taking possession are sown and multiplied throughmultifaceted and deadly deceit.’’39 Augustine dis- cussed a speci c example of this phenomenon in his literal commentary onGenesis: Marsian snake charmers and their audiences alike think that the snakes respond to the commands of the Marsi, while in fact it is demons who move the snakes in response to human incantations.40 It is a remarkablemodel of the collusion between pagan and demon that brings pleasure and pride to both in the short term, and likewise damnation to both in the long term. 30 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="8"> We can now  nally ask what about the interaction of Christians with columns and pictures elevated their veneration above idolatry. Even if we concede Au- gustine’s metaphysical distinction between transcendent creator and created de- mon, we do not yet know why representational artwork in Christian contexts did not trap Christians in delusion as pagan statuary trapped the pagan viewer. We might expect to  nd an answer in the third book of On Christian Doctrine. Writing in the  nal years of the fourth century, Augustine there discussed three attitudes toward signs and symbols in religious worship: Christian, Jewish, and pa- gan. Turning  rst to the Jews, Augustine argued that they had fallen astray because they did not understand the metaphysical gap that separates the human and the divine. In particular they did not understand that this gap requires human lan- guage to represent the divine through allegory even as human ritual must use tem- poral and carnal signs to refer to spiritual realities. The Jews stand apart from the pagans not in their freedom from carnalis seruitus, but in their awareness of the need to worship the one eternal God.41 Denouncing pagan allegories in terms with which we are now familiar, Augustine felt compelled to confess that ‘‘they have nevertheless sunk lower, who think the works of men are gods, as opposed to those who so regard the works of God.’’42 We thus  nd ourselves at an impasse. There seems no way to shield Christian practice from the criticisms Augustine leveled against pagan worship without si- multaneously legitimizing allegorical ‘‘interpretations’’ of pagan idols. Augustine himself recognized this dilemma: even as religious rituals require temporalia et car- nalia uota et signa, so our human and  eshly weakness prevents us from distinguish- ing the objects of veneration and of worship.43 It was only natural, even if it was wrong, formisguided Christians to worship columnas in ecclesia. The Christian could avoid some of the seductive power of those anthropomorphic idols ‘‘whose form has such power over the aVections of the miserable,’’ but Augustine could not deny, as he could not cease, the use of instruments and vases of metal and other materials in the rituals that he himself supervised. ‘‘And what were those objects but the work of human hands?’’44 But why were temporal and carnal signs and symbols necessary in Christian worship?Writing of communication in liturgical settings, Augustine lamented that interpretations, lessons, blessings, and prayers all took the form of spoken utter- ances: the words of human language could all too easily be misconstrued, and yet they were necessary because of ‘‘the abyss of the world and the blindness of the  esh, because of which thoughts cannot be seen, so that it is necessary to make sounds in each other’s ears.’’45 Although Augustine located the origin of this blind- ness in the Fall, his argument bears at least a super cial resemblance to the argu- ments of Julian the Apostate in his important and impassioned defense of the use and allegorizing interpretation of statues in pagan worship. ‘‘Our fathers estab- lished statues and altars and the maintenance of eternal  res and, really, all such things as symbols of the presence of the gods, not so that we would believe the Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 31 </page> <page sequence="9"> statues, altars and  res to be gods, but so that through them we might worship the gods. For just as we are in the body, so we must perform our worship of the gods through bodily means.’’46 Toward a Hermeneutics of Religious Metaphor We have already seen that Augustine used the vocabulary of language, allegory, and interpretation to articulate his refutation of pagan apologies for idola- try. It may be, then, that we can dissolve the present impasse in our investigation by turning to a similar problem in Augustine’s philosophy of language, and in par- ticular to his thought on religious metaphor. For, according to Augustine, most words pointed to things other than themselves, even as artwork points beyond itself to the realities that the idols or statues or paintings represent. Religious metaphor, moreover, necessarily applied words to contexts to which such wordswere not liter- ally appropriate. How were readers to know that words in Christian texts often referred allegorically to a higher, more complex reality, while words in pagan texts necessarily referred to created things? To answer this question I turn  rst to the sermon that Augustine delivered on 16 March 413; the reading that day was the  rst  ve verses of the Gospel of John: ‘‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.’’ If there is any verse that must mean something other than what it literally says, it is this one. For even if Augustine simply asserted that the ‘‘Word’’ was Christ—and, on several occasions in other works, he did just that—he would still have to account for the use of ‘‘Word’’ itself. And if he wished to be candid with his congregation, he would have simultaneously to explain the relationship between these verses and the creation narratives in Genesis.47 Augustine, of course, did not avoid the complexities of Scripture. I highlight here three aspects of his sermon on that day. First, Augustine twice cautioned his audience that those whose souls were still ‘‘small’’ or ‘‘beast-like’’—that is, those who still thought ‘‘according to the  esh’’—would have diYculty ascending to a ‘‘spiritual understanding’’ ofGod’s transcendence; second, Augustine urged his au- dience not to interpret terms like ‘‘the Word’’ or descriptions of God speaking as though God were like a man, whose words sound in time and then pass away; and third, he ultimately explained the nature of those forms that exist in the Word by appealing to the diVerence between a box and the design of that box in the mind of a carpenter.48 Each of these feats actualizes rhetorical or pedagogical strategies well known from Augustine’s other works. Each also illustrates a more deep-seated problem within Augustinian theological discourse: namely, how could a human acquire secure knowledge about the divine and, having acquired that knowledge, subsequently represent it in words? 32 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="10"> We can clarify Augustine’s profound investment in that problem in general, and in its application to the Creation narrative in particular, by re ecting on the intersection between his metaphysics and his philosophy of language.49 The divine sits atop a metaphysical order at whose bottom lay objects accessible by sense- perception.So, for example, a true vision of the ‘‘eternal wisdom that abides beyond all things’’ can come only to those in whom ‘‘the tumult of the  esh falls silent, the images of earth and waters and air are silent . . . , for whom all language and every sign and, in sum, all transitory things are silent.’’50 Augustine elsewhere articulated the ontological priority of the divine in autobiographical terms: God had been dis- tant from the fantasies of Augustine’s pagan adolescence—‘‘fantasies of corporeal things that have no existence’’—because Augustine had been ‘‘unaware of another reality, that which truly is.’’51 In between the divine and the corporeal fall spiritual creatures—for example, the angels—and then the world of the intellect. The words of human language, that sound and pass away, were, for Augustine, the preeminent measure of human frailty and, in their essential ephemerality, the abiding sign of humanweakness.52And so, becauseAugustineprivileged the intelligibleworld over the sensible one, wordswithin intellectual or theological discoursemust be not only mere signs of ideas but also inadequate ones: they are not simply diVerent from their referents; they are inferior to them.53 In spite of his frequent protestations to the contrary, then, Augustine could not always read Scripture literally. As he acknowledged inThe City of God and elsewhere, there were passages that had to be read allegorically, just as the obscurity of some verses provided bene cial exercise for the earnest reader.54 The reading of Genesis in particular could yield multiple correct interpretations because it, above all other books, attempted to describe God.55 In the absence of a comprehensible, objective reality there can be no semantically autonomous statements: all language becomes metaphoric.Genesis fails in particular because it representsGod acting in time and space, and therefore as constrained by them. Its narrative, Augustinecomplained in the fourth book of his commentary on its literal interpretation, describes Creation as a series of actions arranged according to causal connection (‘‘quae singillatim per ordinem conexarum causarum sermo distinguit’’).56 And yet, he conceded in the next book of that same work, one human could not speak to another concerning God’s ineVable substance without the inappropriate usage of words of time and place.57 Humans must use discursive language, and discursive language simply can do no better. This dilemma permeated every aspect of Augustinian theology and hermeneu- tics, and it admitted of no easy solution. If the inspired writers of Scripture had to resort to catachresis, what choice did Augustine have? In the  rst instance, it might seem that the application of this metaphysical hierarchy to language condemned all theological discourse to failure.But Augustine used this failure in the representa- tional capacity of language to explain, rather than assert, the privileged status of Christian scripture. According to him, the language of this world could surely por- Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 33 </page> <page sequence="11"> tray the things of this world: pagan texts about pagan demons treat only created things, and thus can and should be read literally. On the other hand, since themeta- physical gap between divine matters and human speech is so great, any human utterance on so elevated a subject must be inscrutable: the more comprehensible the text, the greater its misrepresentation of divine reality must be. Texts about the true divinity alone have justi cation for their obscurity, and they alone warrant, and indeed require, the application of a scriptural hermeneutics.58 But Augustine had more than a philosophical argument in favor of religious metaphor. He believed that Scripture provided full justi cation for his approach. First, the Apostle Paul advised in his letter to the Romans that ‘‘the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood from the things that are made.’’59 Augustine appealed to this verse repeatedly, whether justi- fying the language of Scriptureor his own analogies, but that was, as he understood, a dangerous road to travel. If Augustine occasionally asked that ‘‘God grant to hu- mankind to see in small things truths common to both small and great matters,’’ he also understood the danger of constructing analogies that construed the divine on the basis of the terrestrial.60 Consequently, much later in life, he would use this verse and those that follow it in the fashion that Paul intended: to acknowledge and strictly control the super cial similarities between popularizing Christian and Platonic metaphysics.61 Augustine located a second Scriptural justi cation for religious metaphor in Genesis. That book describes God saying, ‘‘ ‘Let us make man after our image and likeness’ ’’ (Gen. 1:25). Augustine found in the jumbled singulars and plurals of this verse a clear reference to the unity in theTrinity ofGod, theHoly Spirit, and Christ. Since, moreover, it was obvious to him that our similarity to God lies in our posses- sion of a rational soul and not in any physical likeness, Augustine used this verse to provide Scriptural warrant for understanding the divine through the systematic analogical extension of his own conception of the trinity within mankind.62 Augustine thus foregrounded the source whence his metaphors derived their explanatory power. The method itself, regardless of its Scriptural paradigm, in- volved Augustine in a logical fallacy from which he could not emerge unscathed. In proceeding from ‘‘created things’’ to the divine, from the sensible world to the spiritual, Augustine sought to explain the complex on analogy with the simple. How could he de ne the superiority of the divine when all he knew for certain was the fact of its superiority? Ultimately he resorted to a long series of negative de nitions: God was not like man in his relationship with time and space. This procedure tended, among other things, to raise problems of predication.63 Con- sider, for example, Augustine’s attempt to describe the forms in theWord: ‘‘Knowl- edge cannot come about unless the objects to be known exist before; and these objects exist  rst in the Word, through which all things have been made, before they exist in all the things that have been made. In the same way, the human mind  rst perceives the things that have been made [haec, quae facta sunt] through the 34 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="12"> senses of the body and acquires knowledge of them in accordance with the limits of human in rmity, and then seeks to learn their origins.’’64 Augustine labels these processes as analogous (‘‘itaque’’), yet humans strive to proceed from the particular instantiation to an understanding of the form, while Augustine’s spiritual creatures contemplate the form in the Word before they themselves create the individual ob- jects.65 Could Augustine proceed with such metaphoric construal for long without arriving at a target domain that participated, in some fashion, in the qualities of its subordinate source? Although Augustine did not understand the dangers of his method in precisely these terms, there can be no question that he recognized the existence of those dangers.66 He tended to allude to them in either of two contexts:  rst, citing the precedent of Scripture, he often appealed to the pedagogical value of catachrestic language. In The City of God he allowed that Scripture spoke of God as angry not because God’s anger is actually a ‘‘perturbationof His soul,’’ but ‘‘in order to terrify the proud and arouse the derelict, to exercise the inquisitive and nourish the intelli- gent,’’ and Scripture ‘‘could not have done this without lowering itself and in some fashion descending to them where they lie.’’67 He had certainly formulated this position by 400, in his second letter to Ianuarius: there he argued that allegorical language has the power to in ame a soul still trapped in earthly matters (‘‘quam diu rebus adhuc terrenis implicatur’’) by directing its attention  rst to likenesses of physical objects (‘‘ad similitudines corporales’’) and thence to the spiritual things that the corporal likenesses  guratively represent (‘‘ad spiritualia, quae illis simili- tudinibus  gurantur’’).68 And yet Augustine also acknowledged that such meta- phoric language carried its own risks. First, as he infrequently admitted, even in- spired Scripture could and did fail through the use of such language: familiarity with the  esh would always lead some to despise the nourishment of Scripture’s simple language and in proud weakness fall.69 Second, Augustine alluded to the dangers of metaphoric language when he chastised those who failed to make the conceptual leap from the realm of physical bodies to that of the spirit and thence to that of the intellect. For example, he la- mented that some readers of Genesis misconstrue its language and so ‘‘think of God as if he were a man or some power immanent in a vast mass [quasi aliquam mole immensa praeditampotestatem]which, by somenew and sudden desire exter- nal to itself, created at some spatial remove both heaven and earth, two great bodies, one above and the other below, in which all things are contained.’’70 In his third book,On Christian Doctrine, he directed this charge against those who read Scripture too literally: ‘‘He who follows letters, interprets metaphorical terms as if they were literal and does not refer that which is literally signi ed to its target domain. . . . It is a wretched slavery of the soul, indeed, to prefer signs to realities, and not to be able to lift the eye of the mind above physical creation to drink in eternal light.’’71 I have already mentioned his concern for those who think ‘‘according to the  esh,’’ as expressed in his sermon on the Gospel of John. In his commentary on Genesis Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 35 </page> <page sequence="13"> Augustine repeatedly warned against drawing excessively rigid analogies between the physical and the divine. Commenting there on the representation of God’s speech in the narrative of creation, he asked, ‘‘Who existed at that time, who was supposed to hear and to understand, to whom was a word of this type addressed? But this is an absurd and  eshly way of thinking.’’72 Augustine never articulated a method for determining the limits of analogical extension and he tended to indict his doctrinal opponents for failing to perceive that such limits existed. He did not, however, spare himself. Toward the end of On the Trinity, for example, he sadly acknowledged that he had overextended his model. Portraying the intellect as an inner man, Augustine came to ask how amind thinks about itself. How can we speak of the mind’s eye when a mind can think about itself but an eye cannot see itself ? Augustine confessed that he had reached an impasse because he had ‘‘thought with the imagined images of physical objects.’’73 Augustine was ultimately unable to remain consistent in his restrictions on the use of metaphors. He thus occasionally employed a metaphorical expression that he himself had elsewhere criticized. For example, in the sixth book of his commen- tary on Genesis he labeled a ‘‘childish thought’’ the notion that God had formed man with the slime of the earth using bodily hands.74 In The City of God, however, he used precisely that example—speaking of the hands or feet ofGod—to illustrate those expressions that men understand in a metaphorical sense when used of God’s ineVable nature.75 Similarly, in the eighth book of that commentary he denied the relevance of words of place in discussions of the soul and yet, in his  rst sermon on the Gospel of John, he justi ed describing the entrance of Wisdom into John as an ‘‘ascent’’ by asserting that whatever is superior must be above.76 He contradicted himself again later in that sermon when he compared the role of Forms in creation with the design for a box that existed in the mind of a carpenter; he had,  fteen years earlier in the Confessions, scoVed at comparing God to a human artisan. In that text he had argued that God created rational souls and physical objects out of nothing, while an artisan shapes one physical object from another through an act of will, as if imposing a form that he sees within himself bymeans of his internal eye.77 Nowhere does Augustine seem closer to contradicting himself than in the  rst book of On the Trinity. There he castigated three groups as equally perverse:  rst, those who tried to understand the Trinity by applying to the incorporeal, spiritual world notions literally appropriate only to tangible objects, second, those who as- signed to God an emotional soul like that of humans, and, last, those who attempted to ascend to God’s unchangeable substance while still burdened by the exceedingly heavy weight of their mortality.78 In the very next paragraph, however, he argued that Scripture attempted to correct such people precisely through the use of meta- phorical language drawn from everyday experience. Writing as if for children, it employed words of every sort, drawn from the physical and spiritual worlds, ‘‘in order that our intellect, as though nourished, might rise, step by step, as it were, toward the divine.’’ Thus sacred scripture not only used words appropriate to cor- 36 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="14"> poreal things, but also those appropriate to spiritual creatures, ‘‘in order to signify that which is not so, but which must be said to be so.’’79 It makes no diVerence whether they ‘‘must be said to be so’’ because human language cannot represent divine realities or because human minds cannot understand those realities—Au- gustine believed both to be true. What is crucial is that religious metaphor, for all its scriptural basis, possesses a power at once to enlighten and to deceive. The paradoxicalassertions that humansmisunderstand the Trinity by thinking in a  eshly fashion, but that these same people must be taught using  eshly lan- guage, returns us to the central problem of this essay. For neither Paul nor Genesis had authorized Augustine merely to write about God using metaphoric language, although Augustine certainly understood both texts in those terms. Rather, he viewed Paul’s instruction simultaneously as an exhortation to look for re ections of God and the Trinity in created things. This seemed only natural: ‘‘For by the very order of our condition,whereby we aremademortal and carnal, we apply ourselves more easily and, so to speak, more familiarly to visible things.’’80 The justi cation for religiousmetaphor, for the catachrestic application to the divine of the terminol- ogy of this world, and for seeking the divine in the things of this world, was one and the same. It was on this basis that Augustine could lament in his literal com- mentary on Genesis that ‘‘if a man cannot yet grasp what takes place in himself, how much less will he comprehend what is above him!’’81 To put it bluntly, things, and words about things, possess the same metaphysical status. We can now return to Augustine’s defense of signs and symbols in Christian worship. But, it will be said, we have many instruments and vases made of materials of this kind or frommetal, for use in celebrating the sacraments, which, being consecrated by this function, are called holy, in honor of Him who is worshiped for our salvation. And what are these instruments or vases, except the works of human hands? But do they have mouths, and not speak? Do they have eyes, and not see? Do we pray to them, because through them we pray to God? This is the chief cause of that impious insanity: the form resembling a living crea- ture has such power over the aVections of the miserable that it arouses prayers to itself, even though it is clear that it is not alive, so that it ought to be despised by the living. The images have more power to distract an unhappy soul because they have mouths, eyes, ears, noses, hands, and feet, than they have power for correcting such a soul because they do not speak or see or hear or smell or argue or walk.82 The distinction between objects that distract and objects that correct parallels the paradox at the start of On the Trinity. Just as Augustine distinguished between correct and incorrect uses of allegorical language by judging the status of their refer- ents, so his ability to distinguish between pagan and Christian signs and symbols was predicated upon the metaphysical status of the respective recipients of pagan and Christian worship.No matter what the referent of their idols, pagans were wor- shiping created things and thus turning the truth of God into a lie.83 Augustine thus accused philosophers of erroneous analogical extension—‘‘calling themselves Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 37 </page> <page sequence="15"> wise, they attribute to themselves things that are God’s . . . and transform the glory of incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man.’’84 Yet he simultaneously depictedChristian worship of created things as amisguided attempt to understand God’s immanence in this world through created things. It was, after all, ‘‘from our clay in the inferior parts of God’s creation’’ that ‘‘God’s Word, His eternal Truth, built himself a humble house, though He resides eternally above the superior parts of that creation.’’85 What Has Christ to Do with Semiotics? A Reading of the Confessions We might be tempted to accuse Augustine of hypocrisy or inconsistency or error. Recognizing no metaphysical hierarchy of ritual objects or sacred and sec- ular texts, and ignoring ontological distinctions between the referents of those texts that were for Augustine fundamental, we seek from him a hermeneutics, a theory of signs, and a philosophyof representation that can inform our readings of his work and, more important, that will situate him within the very intellectual traditions in which we imagine ourselves participating. What has Christ to do with semiotics? Those who ask whether Augustine believed in natural or given signs or trace his debt to Stoic linguistics have responded, ‘‘Nothing.’’ In doing so, they ignore Au- gustine’s answer: ‘‘Everything.’’ It is ‘‘Christ, that is, the incommutable virtue and eternal wisdom of God’’ that ‘‘every rational soul’’ consults when it seeks with its mind’s eye light suYcient to distinguish truth and falsehood and to illuminate the relationship between signs and referents in human discourse.86 Augustine thus subordinated his varied intellectual projects to an overall theo- logical program that rendered his theory of signs and his concern for the metaphys- ics of representation in some irreducible way discontinuous with the earlier tradi- tions on which he drew, and which might properly foreclose or at least compromise attempts to posit Augustine as the forebear of any given academic discipline. To understand how he came to invoke the incarnation in such varied contexts, we must both recall and interrogate his account of the process by which he sought ‘‘the immortality of wisdom with an incredible burning of his heart.’’87 Modern readers conditioned by post-Augustinian pruriencemight well be sur- prised to learn that Augustine attributed his failure to convert not to any morbid attachment to sexual pleasure, but to an intellectual impasse conceived in meta- physical terms. ‘‘When I wanted to think of my God, I knew of no way of doing so except as a physical mass, nor did it seem to me that there was anything that was not material: this was the principle and almost sole cause of my inevitable error.’’88 Trapped by the order of his condition by which he was made mortal and carnal, Augustine was ‘‘so submerged and blinded that he could not think of the light of moral goodness and of a beauty to be embraced for its own sake—beauty not seen by the eye of the  esh but only by inward discernment.’’89 38 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="16"> Augustine the bishop thus summarized the theological errors of his uncon- verted former self by pointing to his inability to conceive of a metaphysical hier- archy in which his  esh, his language, and the objects of sense perception lay at the bottom,a handicap that had led him to picture the divine by extending ametaphor- ical model whose source lay in created things. The Confessions narrates the dissolu- tion of this impasse in stages. The year 386 marked a watershed. Augustine had arrived in Milan to take up a professorship of rhetoric. There he encountered the bishop Ambrose. Listening to the sermons of that ‘‘man of God,’’ Augustine began to imagine not, perhaps, decisive arguments for orthodox faith, but reasonable ar- guments defending that faith against the assaults of Manichaean dualist material- ism. ‘‘In that time of my hesitation, after the fashion of the Academics (as they were popularly understood), I doubted everything and  oated in a sea of possibilities.’’ Nevertheless, Augustine ‘‘blushed with joyful shame to learn that he had for so many years barked not at orthodox faith but at the  ctions of  eshly thoughts’’— an important breakthrough, even if ‘‘he did not yet suspect, neither faintly nor through an enigma, how there could be spiritual substance’’ [spiritalis substantia].90 This next obstacle Augustine removed through his reading of ‘‘certain books of the Platonists.’’ There he read, ‘‘not, of course, in these words, butwith altogether the same sense and supported by many and varied arguments [non quidem his uer- bis, sed hoc idem omnino multis et multiplicibus . . . rationibus], that ‘in the begin- ning was the Word and the Word was with God and God was the Word.’ ’’91Mod- ern readers are so surprised at his claim to have found John in quidam Platonicorum libri—and many so feverishly desire to identify those books—that they all but ig- nore Augustine’s subsidiary claim that the metaphysical assumptions underlying such Platonizing Christian theologies were actually susceptible to demonstration through ‘‘many and varied arguments.’’92 For reasons that I shall attempt presently to untangle, Augustine let this assertion stand here unexplained. Instead, what he learned from those books, or, rather, what he claimed in 397 to have learned from them more than a decade earlier, was the existence of ‘‘two substances.’’ God then ‘‘closed his eyes, lest they see vanity.’’ ‘‘Little by little, I came to rest apart from my- self, and my madness was put to sleep. I woke up in you and I saw that you are in-  nite in another sense, and this vision did not come from the  esh.’’93 Augustine’s appreciation of the transcendence of God’s spiritual substance re- quired that he cease ‘‘his absurd and  eshly way of thinking.’’ He had as a result to reconsider the theories of representation to which he had formerly adhered, and, concomitantly, to review his appreciation for religious metaphor and his under- standing of the representational capacities of human speech. ‘‘I entered myself and with the eye of my soul, such as it was, I saw above that same eye an immutable light higher than my mind: not the light of every day, which is visible to all  esh, nor a more grandiose version of the same kind. . . . It was not that light, but a diVer- ent thing, utterly diVerent from all our kinds of light. It was not above my mind in the way that oil  oats on water, nor as heaven is above earth, but it was superior, Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 39 </page> <page sequence="17"> because it made me, and I was inferior, because I was made by it.’’94 Augustine now ranked himself among those who drew an appropriatedistinction between Creator and created things: ‘‘Now my goods were not external, nor were they sought by  eshly eyes in the light of this sun. For those wishing to rejoice in external things easily become empty and are poured out into things that are visible and temporal, and with starving minds they lick at the images of these things.’’95 The success of this conversion to a new metaphysics and all that it entailed was predicated upon a less celebrated revolution in Augustine’s intellectual life. The Confessions place this event, too, in Milan in 386. Augustine knew that seven and three were ten; he had wanted to be similarly certain about physical things that were not present to his senses, and likewise about spiritual things about which he could then think only in a  eshly way. ‘‘If I had believed, I could have been healed’’ [et sanari credendo poteram], he wrote in 397, ‘‘as the more pure eye of my mind would then have been directed in some fashion toward your truth, which abides forever and is no way de cient.’’96 Looking back at 386, he lamented that he had not then accepted the medicamenta dei, ‘‘the medicaments of faith.’’ The path he took was more circuitous, and it followed the program outlined above: he elided the distinction between knowledge and belief in corporalia—he realized ‘‘how un- shakeably secure was his faith that he knew who his parents were, something he could not have known if he had not believed what he had heard’’—and then, ‘‘as- signing a privileged place to orthodoxdoctrine,’’ he judged it ‘‘moremodest and not in the least misleading to be ordered to believe what could not be demonstrated’’ [praeponens doctrinam catholicam modestius ibi minimeque fallaciter sentiebam iuberi, ut crederetur quod non demonstrabatur].97 Augustine debated the rami cations of this epistemological revolution formore than a decade, and he would always remain sensitive to the circularity of citing Scripture in defense of faith. Augustine must have realized that his parentage was, if not strictly speaking knowable by him, nevertheless knowable, in a way that the tenets of orthodoxdoctrinewere not. In his earliest extant work,written justmonths after this breakthrough, Augustine investigated the value of Academic skepticism and betrayed his new epistemology in the preface to the second book: ‘‘Beware lest you think that you know anything other than that which you truly know, as you know that the sum of one, two, three, and four is ten. But likewise beware lest you think that the truth cannot be understood through philosophy or that it cannot be understood in the same way. Trust me or, rather, trust him who said, ‘Seek and you shall  nd’: do not despair of understanding and it will be more clear than those numbers.’’98 He would soon discover a more apposite scriptural tag than Matthew 7:7, namely, Isaiah 7:9, ‘‘Nisi credideritis, non intellegetis,’’ (Unless you believe, you shall not understand).99 That verse is stunningly absent from the Confessions. It is likewise present only through allusion in an earlier essay, ‘‘On the True Religion,’’ which Augustine wrote in 390. It was dedicated to Romanianus, who had also received the book On 40 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="18"> the Academics, and it is to his critical appreciation for skepticism that this later essay responds. In a central, programmatic passage Augustine described the animae medi- cina supplied by Providence, namely, authority (auctoritas) and reason (ratio). Authority demands faith [ des] and prepares man for reason. Reason leads to understand- ing and knowledge [intellectum cognitionemque], although reason is not altogether lacking from authority, since reason must be consulted regarding whomwe should believe, and cer- tainly the highest authority is that of truth already and clearly known. But because we dwell among temporal things and are held back from eternal things by love of temporalia, we assign priority to a kind of temporal medicine, which summons to health not those who know but those who believe, although its priority is not due to the excellence of its nature but to its order in time.100 He returned to this problem twicemore over the next decade, once some two years after ‘‘On the True Religion’’ and again some three years after writing the Confes- sions. The  rst essay, ‘‘On the Usefulness of Believing,’’ exhorts aManichee to aban- don his faith in the  ve senses of his body and to conceive of spiritual substance; the second, ‘‘On Faith in Things Unseen,’’ likens religious faith to belief in corporalia that are not present to one’s senses. Neither cites Isaiah 7:9.101 What Augustine presumablywished to avoid was to be seen resolving an episte- mological crux by appeal to scriptural  at, an anxiety about the extrarational de- mands of faith that Augustine felt deeply and whose dissolution his native desire for logical rigor could not quite permit.102 Matthew’s exhortation to seek in order to  nd, which Augustine cited in his second book of On the Academics and which occupies a programmatic position at the opening of the Confessions, seemingly re- quires a very diVerent kind of commitment than does Isaiah’s exhortation to surrender.103 Augustine’s elision of the boundary between knowing things and knowing God—despite his insistence on the ontologicalpriority of the latter—paradoxically directs our attention back to the ‘‘many and varied arguments’’ of the Platonists. Augustine’s eclectic approval of Platonic metaphysics should not be allowed to ob- scure his certainty, expressed more violently elsewhere, that those authors who so understood John ultimately convicted themselves of polytheistic error through the worship of created things.104 That concern has no place in the Confessions, for there Augustine tells his own story and whatever the Platonists did or did not teach Au- gustine, they did not lead him to the worship of demons. But as we have already seen, Augustine does not permit himself to say in Platonic terms what they taught him, either. For Platonic ascensio of the sort that produced Augustine’s visions at Milan and Ostia begins with cuncta corporalia and the beauty of bodies, and if his own Platonic ascension were not to lead to Platonic gods, it would have to be be- cause Augustine ‘‘was wholly certain that [God’s] invisible nature ‘since the foun- dation of the world is understood from the things that are made, that is, [God’s] eternal power and divinity’ (Rom. 1:20).’’105 It was in Augustine’s reading of Romans 1:20 that we located his unarticulated Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 41 </page> <page sequence="19"> distinction between signs in pagan and Christian contexts, and so we return, once again, to the central problem of this essay, whose contours we can now more pre- cisely de ne and whose resolution should now be apparent. For despite Paul’s sanc- tion of his ascensio, Augustine famously judged his vision in Milan a failure: it left him with nothing but a loving memory and a desire for something whose aroma he could possess but whose substance he could not eat.106 Why? What, according to Augustine in 397, had the Platonists failed to understand and been unable to teach him? In sum, the metaphysical status of Christ, ‘‘the mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, who is above all things, God blessed forever.’’ As much as Augustine had learned in order to achieve his ecstatic vision, he still had not understood ‘‘the mystery of the Wordmade  esh.’’107 Readers of the Confessions are easily distracted by Augustine’s apparent need to demonstrate Christological orthodoxy in the twoparagraphs that followhis vision, a concern thatmight appear to take him rather far from the books of the Platonists. And yet, his insistence that Christ was not merely a human body or simply a body and soul without a mind, but rather a fully human person, encapsulated both a Christological position and a Christian metaphysics. For what a Platonist could not accept was that Christ pos- sessed divinity ‘‘by which he is equal to his father’’ and humanity ‘‘by which he was made similar to us.’’108 What is more, it was precisely the achievements of Platonic metaphysics that led its adherents to err. As Augustine assented to his  ctive interlocutor’s assertion that ‘‘invisible substances are better than every visible substance, since everything visible is a physical thing,’’ so he allowed that worshipers of demons were often misled by arrogant faith in their theological orthodoxy. Many have been lifted up by pride in their high culture. . . . Through an aYnity in heart they attracted to themselves as associates and allies of their pride ‘‘the powers of the air’’ (Eph. 2:2) who deluded them with magical powers. They sought a mediator to purify them, and it was not the true one. For it was ‘‘the devil transforming himself into an angel of light’’ (2 Cor. 11:14). It was a potent enticement for proud  esh that he had no carnal body [et multum inlexit superbam carnem, quod carneo corpore ipse non esset]. . . . But the media- tor between God and the human race ought to have something in common with God and something in common with humanity.109 It was the overly rigorous application of a Platonizing metaphysics that led such people to mistake the merely invisible for the truly divine, to disallow the incarna- tion, and tomisrecognize the diVerent referential functions served by signs in sacred and secular contexts. ‘‘For do not many with great talent err?’’ We might wish that Augustine had subjected the incarnation to the sort of searching inquiry he devoted to God’s transcendence in book 11 of the Confessions, and so devised for it, too, ‘‘many and varied arguments.’’ He did not do so. Instead, he asked why God had wanted him to encounter the books of the Platonists before he pondered God’s Scripture. The counterfactual rhetorical question, of purely biographical signi cance, leads nowhere.110 In fact, Augustine had raised the same 42 Re pr e s e ntati on s </page> <page sequence="20"> question in a very diVerent form exactly a decade earlier. At the close of his longest speech in the third book ofOn the Academics, Augustine denounced popular versions of Academic skepticism as a dead end. He no longer thought that humans could not  nd the truth (‘‘satis est iam non arbitrari non posse ab homine inueniri uerita- tem’’). Although Augustine knew that he had not yet attained humana sapientia, he no longer doubted that wisdomwas to be sought on two bases, authority and reason (auctoritas et ratio), and he vowed never again to depart from the authority of Christ.111 For it was only through Christ—into whose very human body the highest god had lowered and submitted the authority of the divine intellect—that man could legitimately seek not the philosophy of this world, but that of the other, intelli- gible one (‘‘ista huius mundi philosophia . . . sed alterius intellegibilis’’).112 The epiphanies of Christ within Augustine’s philosophical writings strike us as intrusions, the willful recourse to extrarational a priori assertions, and so they seem, they do, in fact, foreclose reasoned reconstructionof an internally consistent theory of signs or philosophy of representation from his corpus. Augustine would not have recognized the legitimacy of our frustration. The incarnation was, for him, a dis- ruption in the history and development of humankind, of course, but also in the discursive traditions whose assumptions and arguments underlay the varied theo- ries of signs and idols,God and knowledge, to whichAugustinewas heir. His closing assessment of the Academics therefore outlines an epistemological justi cation for the failure of rational human discourse in the pursuit of wisdom. Platonic theology had been correct in identifying an unbridgeablegap betweenGod andman; ‘‘faith’’ or ‘‘belief ’’ in appropriate authorities was Augustine’s solution to the inability of an internally consistent Platonic theology to conceive of Christ. Augustine’s concern to narrate his own intellectual development did not blind him to the existence of other, better paths to wisdom.His encounter with the Plato- nists had not damned him only because Augustine was later made docile (‘‘man- suefactus essem’’) and taught to distinguish between presumption and confession (‘‘quid interesset inter praesumptionem et confessionem’’).113 The Platonists might see, as froma wooded summit, the homeland of peace, but their pathwas, paradoxi- cally, pathless and beset with dangers.114 It was better to start with Christ, the one truemediator, andwith his help to ascend from the contemplationof created things, after the fashion of our carnal senses, to the contemplation of spiritual things with the gaze of the mind, and thence ‘‘to see the unchangeable God by whom and through whom and in whom all things were made.’’115 For it was not the wisdom of this world, Augustine concluded in his great homily from 1 January 404, but the nature of theMediator that alone could bridge themetaphysical gap that Augustine so often skirted but could neither grasp nor express: ‘‘In him we have a corporeal created thing; in him we have a spiritual created thing, and in him there is the Word itself through which all things are made.’’116 Signs, Idols, and the Incarnation in Augustinian Metaphysics 43 </page> <page sequence="21"> No t e s For comments on earlier drafts, my thanks to Ruth Abbey, Steven Justice, and Sa- bine MacCormack. 1.

Conf. 9.10.25. 51. Conf. 3.6.10 and 7.12 (trans. after H. Chadwick, Augustine: Confessions [Oxford, 1991]), culminating in the admission ‘‘nesciebam enim aliud, uere quod est.’’ 52. See, for example, Conf. 13.15.18,where Augustine describes the activities of angels in the heaven of heavens: ‘‘Uident enim faciem tuam semper et ibi legunt sine syllabis temporum, quid uelit aeterna uoluntas tua. Legunt, eligunt et diligunt; semper legunt et numquam praeterit quod legunt. Eligendo enim et diligendo legunt ipsam incom- mutabilitatem consilii tui. Non cauditur codex eorum nec plicatur liber eorum.’’ Ob- serve, too, Augustine’s call to understand God’s Word (Conf. 11.6.8–7.9): That word was not like the voice that said ‘‘This is my beloved Son,’’ ‘‘for that voice was spoken and completed, began and ended. The syllables sounded and passed away, the second following the  rst, and the third following the second, and so on, in order, until the past followed the others and silence followed the last.’’ Citing Isaiah 40:8, ‘‘The Word of my God is above me and abides for ever,’’ Augustine argued that God’s Word is spoken eternally and all things are spoken in it eternally. No element of that word ceases and passes away, but with it God says all that he says in simultaneity and eternity.

Origen Contra Celsum 7.46–47. G. Madec, ‘‘Connais- sance de Dieu et action de graˆces: essai sur les citations de l’E ́p aux.

Green, ed., Sancti Aure- lii Augustini Contra Academicos (Turnhout, 1970). 99. Augustine  rst cited Isaiah 7:9 between fall 387and fall 388atDe libero arbitrio 1.2.4.11 and soon thereafter at Mag. 11.37, notwithstanding Augustine’s insistence at Conf. 9.5.13 that he had tried to read Isaiah at the urging of Ambrose but had failed to understand it. In early 391 he wrote the second and third books of De libero arbitrio; at 2.2.6.16 he marshals scriptural support for glossing Isaiah’s intellegere with cognoscere from John 17:3. Isaiah 7:9 in the Vetus Latina translation occupied a prominent place in Augustine’s sermons: it concludes Serm. 118.2 and is discussed at length in Serm. 126.1–2 and Sermones ex collectione Guelferbytana 11.4.3, inG.Morin, ed., Sancti Augustini Sermones post Maurinos reperti (Rome, 1930). As early as 397, in his second book of Doct. Christ. (2.12.17.39),Augustine shows himself aware of the alternate version that Jerome sanctioned in the Vulgate (‘‘nisi credideritis, non permanebitis’’) and does not there dispute its legitimacy, but Augustine never adopts it. Jerome himself attributed that translation to Symmachus, who translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century. In his commentary on Isaiah (3.7.3/9), Jerome, like Augustine, relates the two translations and does nomore than discuss the signi cance to be drawn from each. For testimonia see R. Gryson, ed., Vetus Latina. Die Reste der altlateinischen Bibel, vol. 12, Esaias, pars 1: Introductio Generalis, Capita 1–39 (Freiburg, Germ., 1987– 1993), 228–33. 100.

Mandouze, Saint Augustin , remains unsurpassed in its treatment of this theme, al- though Mandouze pursues it toward very diVerent ends. 103. On Augustine’s use ofMatthew 7:7, particularly its place in his epistemological excur- sus, see O’Donnell, Augustine: Confessions, 2:15–17. 104. Ciu. 8.9–12. It is signi cant that although Augustine cites Rom. 1:20–22 at Ciu. 8.10, he does not use its language to assess or acknowledge or even to dismiss the positive accomplishments of Platonic philosophy. 105. Augustine cites Rom. 1:20 at the start of his ascensio inMilan (Conf. 7.17.23) and again at its climax: ‘‘Et peruenit ad id quod est, in ictu trepidantis aspectus. Tunc uero inui- sibilia tua per ea quae facta sunt intellecta conspexi.’’ Another passage of Paul, Rom. 8:23, encapsulates the transitory joy of the vision at Ostia (Conf. 9.10.24). On the use of Paul in these passages seeMadec, ‘‘Connaissance deDieu et action de graˆces,’’ 276– 84, Courcelle, Recherches, 157–67, and O’Donnell, Augustine: Confessions, 2:428–430. 106.

Augustine had repeat- edly warned his readers that the Incarnation had been missing from the libri Platon- icorum. See, for example, 7.9.14: ‘‘Item legi ibi, quia uerbum, deus, non ex carne, non ex sanguine non ex uoluntate uiri neque ex uoluntate carnis, sed ex deo natus est; sed quia uerbum caro factum est et habitauit in nobis, non ibi legi.’’ 108. Ciu. 9:17. 109. Conf. 10.42.67.Cf. Ciu. 9.15–16 and, more distantly 10.27–29, where Augustine dis- tinguishes between the nature of Christ’s mediation and that of ‘‘the god of Socrates,’’ as it was explained in Apuleius’s De deo Socratis. Augustine’s debts to that work deserve more careful exploration than they have hitherto received. 110. Conf. 7.20.26. 111. Acad. 3.20.43. 112. Acad. 3.19.42. 113. Conf. 7.20.26. 114.

See S. Dolbeau 25.10–12, and here esp. 10: ‘‘Forte enim et cum de tua mente cogitas, aliquid corporeum cogitas consuetudine sensuum carnalium, ut uideatur tibi mens tua aut aer esse aut ignis esse aut lux ista quam cernis.’’ S. Dolbeau 26.59: ‘‘Uos autem, fratres mei, qui forte non uidetis aciementis quod illi uiderunt, et nondum estis idonei transcendere cogitatione animi uniuersam creaturam, non solum corporealem, sed etiam spiritalem, et uidere incommutabilem deum a quo et per quem et in quo facta sunt omnia, ne trepidetis, ne desperetis, quia ille usque ad in mos et in rmos descen- dens se ipsum uobis fecit uiam.’’ 116.
