<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rosemarie Gläser THE APPLICATION OF TRANSFORMATIONAL GENERATIVE GRAMMAR TO THE ANALYSIS OF SIMILES AND METAPHORS IN MODERN ENGLISH THE OUTSET, THE TOPIC UNDER discussion may raise the general question as to what extent Chomsky's generative model is applicable to the field of stylistics. In the recent development of transformational generative grammar, Chomsky's so-called Standard Theory, as suggested in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax 1 has undergone a number of modifica- tions even touching such basic presuppositions as the nature of deep and surface structure. In the light of criticism levelled by such transformationalists as Ross, Lakoff, Fillmore and McCawley against the Standard Theory there might be some doubt whether it is still legitimate to deal with linguistic facts in terms of Chomsky's Aspects. And yet, only a few systematic attempts have been made so far to test Chomsky's concept of deep structure rules on the material of a living language. As I see it, sufficient evidence for what parts of Chomsky's model will be of lasting importance can only be provided by new data of practical linguistic analysis. Chomsky's generative grammar has been con- ceived as an explanation of the native speaker's competence which is defined as his ability to make infinite use of a finite number of elements, to form and understand sentences and to decide whether a sentence is well-formed or deviant. With these general theoretical aims, Chomsky's model is intended as a contribution to a universal grammar of meta-linguistic character and of high explanatory power. 265</page><page sequence="2">If we consider the generative model in this abstract lay-out, there seems to be little or no place for style. Stylistic phenomena can only be incorporated in Chomsky's model if we correlate linguistic competence with linguistic performance, the actual speech event. It is true that Chomsky only wants to deal with the notion of competence, but in fact there is no competence as an end in itself. When the native speaker forms and evaluates actual sentences, performance comes into play, since sentences are results of performance. Sentences, moreover, are isolated parts of discourse, and an immanent feature of discourse is style. In this way, style enters the description of performance as an ingredient of any speech act. Although Chomsky has emphasized that the terms competence and performance should not be identified with the Saussurean dichotomy of langue and parole, the wide range of competence is well suited to cover stylistic features that are traditionally attributed to parole. It is in current usage that deviant structures or particular arrangements of units of speech occur, having different stylistic functions. So far, Chomsky has regarded studies on performance as "by-products" of the description of competence. Such "by- products." as he puts it, are "deviations from rules, as a stylistic device."^ As regards stylistic features in performance, I think, we are justified in applying the set of rules provided by the speaker's linguistic competence. Undoubtedly, one of the lasting achievements of transforma- tional generative grammar is the idea of the gradation of gram- maticalness. As studies on both German3 and English4 texts have proved, this concept can be applied to the analysis of style, especially to poetic diction and tropes. In these explorations, the linguistic unit under research is, however, the sentence, and not the whole text. The micro-linguistic core of the widely accept- ed gradation of grammaticalness is Chomsky's sub-division of the base-component into context-free and context-sensitive sub-cate- gorization rules. These rules allow a more delicate description than the former binary distinction between right and wrong. The descriptive mechanism of grammaticalness, however, cannot contribute to the stylistic interpretation of deviant structures, nor can it account for their stylistic effect. Violations of the phonological norm (phonological rules of 266</page><page sequence="3">the surface structure respectively) will be easily discovered in such sentences as these from Arnold Wesker's Roots: Watcha Jimmy Beales, how you doin', bori (watcha = what you, expressing a greeting, "hallo"; doin' = doing; bor = neighbour). Context-free sub-categorization rules, e.g., morphological rules of well-formedness, are violated in the following case: His wife driv him up in the ole Armstrong (drive = drove) Mother reckon some people get indigestion so bad that go right through theii stomach to the back, (reckon = reckons; so bad = so badly; go = it goes) Such deviations from grammaticalness in terms of a received standard may have an artistic function. Sub-standard forms may be an indicator of a regional dialect (in the quoted example of Norfolk dialect) and at the same time of a sociolect (here working class background), a powerful method of character drawing, in stylistics known as the linguistic portrait. We should take into consideration that dialects proper form a sub-system of the national standard language and may be described as the linguistic competence of the dialect speaker. Hence, dialect forms should be distinguished from such morphological errors occurring in the usage of small children or foreigners, based on wrong analogy; e.g., the oxes drawed the cart. Other deviations from context-free sub-categorization rules are demonstrated by the following examples: John Heath-Stubbs, Selected Poems: I invoke the ambiguous veiled Venuses In their avatars (Venus has the syntactic marker [ - plural] as a proper noun). Dylan Thomas: Myselves The grievers Grieve (Myself shares the feature [ - plural] ). Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse: That was the view, she said, stooping, growing greyer-eyed, that 267</page><page sequence="4">her husband loved. (syntactic marker [ - comparable] ). Deviations from context-sensitive sub-categorization rules may concern strict sub-categorization rules and selectional rules. A strict sub-categorization rule is violated when verbs are used in new syntactic functions, as does Dylan Thomas: There could I marvel my birthday away ( Marvel has the syntactic marker [ - transitive] , marvel away may be understood as a nonce formation of a phrasal verb or rather a contamination between "marvel at" and "twaddle away.") Deviations from selectional rules are in fact the source of many figures of speech such as metaphors, synaesthesia, personi- fication, simile, metonymy and oxymoron. Dylan Thomas begins a poem: A grief ago She who was who I hold, the fats and flower. . . Figures like these are based on structural incompatibility or incongruence, since ago presupposes a noun with the semantic marker [ + temporal]. This particular figure not only occurs in elevated poetry but may also be found in advertising texts where surprise effects are intended. Leech quotes an advertising slogan used by an English firm:5 Only two Alka-Seltzers ago You were feeling down-hearted and low Who would ever know you were under the weather Only two Alka-Seltzers ago I More examples from literary texts: Virginia Woolf, The Waves: I let silence fall, drop by drop ( Silence has the semantic marker [ - liquid].) William Golding, Lord of the Flies : . . . the trees in the forest sighed. . . 0 Sighed is restricted to a human agent, since it is linked with emotions.) Naturally, not all deviant structures bring about a stylistic effect, but some of them can immediately be identified as stylistic devices. On the other hand, it would be absurd to reduce 268</page><page sequence="5">phenomena of style to linguistic deviations only. A macro- linguistic model of communication which according to Roman Jakobson implies addresser, addressee, context, message, contact and code6 calls for other than micro-linguistic categories. Func- tional varieties of speech and registers which are linked with various spheres of activity are determined by selectional rules of a special kind, e.g., settings for casual or non-casual speech, cf. Martin Joos, The Five Clocks ? A functional classification of discourse therefore cannot be based on deviations from gram- maticalness, but rather on an adequate description of speech situations. With these general restrictions, we can say that Chom- sky's gradation of grammaticalness can only form a micro- linguistic core for style analysis. Another aspect of Chomsky's theory which may be extended to the matter of style is the native speaker's linguistic competence. From this competence he derives the ability to understand and even produce poetic structures such as those found in imagery, poetic diction, tropes, and prose fiction. To some extent figures of speech are predictable in poetic discourse. They represent what is generally called "poetic license" or "individual creations." Tropes immediately come to mind when we speak of stylistic features or devices. The effect of such structures and their acceptability in a poetic context, however, cannot be the subject of the native speaker's linguistic competence in Chomsky's terms, but rather an additional faculty of it. It is the speaker's poetic competence that evaluates sentences for their poetic, emotional, or aesthetic value. The term "poetische Kompetenz" was coined by Manfred Bierwisch; the same phenomenon was described by Richard Ohmann as the speaker's "stylistic intuition." The poetic competence is defined as a special function of the linguistic competence which enables the native speaker to produce and understand poetic structures and to interpret their effect in literary texts. In this respect, the poetic competence is interrelated with an aesthetic competence that accounts for aesthetic values in other semiotic systems (music, art) as well. Such considerations lead us to the field of pragmatics, and far beyond Chomsky's micro-linguistic model. With regard to style analysis (as style is an ingredient part 269</page><page sequence="6">of every speech act), we may even introduce the term situational or pragmatic competence. In daily usage the speaker follows certain patterns of style imposed by functional varieties in various fields of activity. As a matter of experience, he knows how to choose the proper formulas of address for finishing a letter or where to choose a casual register. Deviations from situationally motivated linguistic norms are easily recognized and often the source of humour and mockery. The speaker's situational or sociolinguistic competence thus determines the acceptability of an utterance. (An illustrative example was quoted by Nils Erik Enkvist: Your Majesty, My Lords - It is my painful duty to impart to you the momentous and doleful tidings that this morning Lord X peacefully kicked the bucket).8 Finally, in connection with the native speaker's linguistic competence we could assume an empirical or cognitive competence on which the logical validity, or the "truth conditions" (Cf. Paul Ziff9) of an utterance are examined. Paradoxical statements are frequently found in poetry and may cause a strong effect of estrangement; e.g., Lawrence Durrell, Justine: Clouds of dried blood walk the streets like prophesies, the sand is settling into the sea like powder in the curls of a stale wig. In fact, this competence is closely connected with the semantic component of the speaker's linguistic competence (which accounts for the semantic compatibility of lexicon entries). With these extensions of Chomsky's model of competence we have obtained a broader basis for the application of the generative model to the complex phenomenon of style. The various competences discussed so far will serve as an evaluation procedure in style analysis-, in a model of stylistics, where style is generated they may even form a contextual blocking device or corrective in order to exclude sentences which are ill-suited to the given situation. Such extensions of the generative model actually presuppose an explicit description of patterns of style in various situations, such as registers or functional varieties. If we re-examine the micro-linguistic requirements for such a comprehensive model of stylistics, we may come to the conclu- sion that much spade-work is still to be done. The transformational 270</page><page sequence="7">description of modem English syntax undertaken by Paul Roberts1® and supported by individual contributions from Lees, Fillmore and other M.I.T. transformationalists is far from being satisfactory. For the purpose of style analysis of such structures as figures of speech in the sense of ancient rhetoric we need a fairly wide inventory of semantic markers in order to be able to describe semantic transfers. In other words, the deviations from selectional rules which are, for example, the source of metaphors, call for a developed semantic component of the transformational system. For the following practical analysis of figures of speech we need a subtle and suitable inventory of semantic markers of nouns, verbs and adjectives. Unfortunately, the segmentation ("atomizing") of meaning, which has been attempted by several people (e.g., Katz-Postal, Chomsky, Weinreich, Greimas, Pottier)11 has not yet led to a satisfactory number of ultimate semantic constituents with regard to the English language, let alone to semantic universais. In a similar way, the combinatory process of semantic markers has only been described in rough outlines so far. For the present stylistic analysis of tropes and small segments of discourse, we have modified and considerably extended the tree diagram of the semantic sub-classification of the noun which Chomsky has suggested as a binary scheme, thus dividing nouns into common and proper. With a view to actual speech, we have projected the two branches of his draft on one, due to the fact that proper nouns tend to take an article and a plural ending (there are three Bills in our team, Hoovers sell well, Malan was regarded as a South African Hitler). Besides, the necessary cross classification (animate, non-animate, individual, collective) would have led to a cumbersome repetition and redundancy. In contrast to Chomsky we have discarded the node "count" /"non-count," since there is a syntactic and a semantic notion of countability which can hardly be united in one tree diagram (e.g., semantic countability is absent in such collective nouns as herd, flock, staff, government; whereas syntactically seen, such nouns as snow, deer, trout are non-count). The tree diagram of the semantic markers of the noun has the following shape: 271</page><page sequence="8">Noun (common) proper J proper J concrete non-concrete /' /' animate non-animate static non-static . "humanoid" /N non- physical /' &gt; . "humanoid" non- physical &gt; non-physical ./I y' A human y' human object object ^ semi- human animal plant nature artefact organic non-organic human ^^^mass^ mass organic non- material non- organic material (As an auxiliary node, the marker "humanoid" had to be included because in poetic diction there occurs the vocabulary of mytho- logy, such as proper names of ancient gods; in everyday usage we find figures from fairytales and allusions to them quite often in advertising texts.) Comment on the tree diagram: [Non-human] comprises the markers [animal] and [plant] [Nature] covers [organic] and [non-organic] matter: organic: parts of body, parts of a plant, e.g., trunk, finger, root, organs, secretions, e.g., tear, non-organic: ores, topographic formations such as mountain, hill, river, island; elementary forces like rain, thunderstorm etc. [Artefact] is understood as the result of intentional production of man, the result of work: physical objects: table, bread, fibre, book; non-material: song, poem, word. [Organic mass] : substance not having contours: blood, sweat; organic substance and mixtures: flour, dough. [Non-organic mass] : metals, gravel, sand, lava, raw material like Orion. 272</page><page sequence="9">[Non-concrete] (=abstract) static: moods like happiness, frustration, system; non-static (=dynamic): revolution, war, upheaval, development. (The classificatory scheme touches a general problem: it is extremely difficult to classify the whole material and immaterial world on a logical basis and even more so on a linguistic principle. A number of dictionaries compiled as a thesaurus have demon- strated the problem of finding logical categories that cover linguistic homonymy and polysemy and do not disturb semantic relations.) The present tree diagram of semantic markers of the noun may provide the basis for a sub-classification of verbs and adjectives. These parts of speech have to a lesser degree inherent (context- free) semantic features; their syntactic and semantic compatibil- ity with other parts of the sentence greatly depends on the semantic markers of the noun (e.g. selectional restrictions of subject and object). Inherent features of the verb are, e.g., such markers as surface contact- hit, break, touch- (cf. Fillmore), ^ motion, and state. The inherent semantic features of the verb, on the other hand, dominate the selection of an adverbial. In the following part of my paper, which is to illustrate the application of transformational grammar to stylistic devices, I focus attention on some figures of speech which have in common the "violation" of selectional rules of the base. These figures are the simile, various sub-groups of metaphors such as personification (anthropomorphism), and animal metaphor. As a figure of speech the simile, or stylistic comparison, shares the structural pattern of the grammatical comparison: both are based on an embedding transformation and form a semantic and syntactic parallelism. The peculiarity of the stylistic comparison, however, is that it has a semantic tension between the noun comparing ( le comparant) and the noun compared (le comparé ). As a rule, in the grammatical comparison the missing link, traditionally called tertium comparationis (le trait commun ), which is the expression of equality or inequality, is represented in the surface structure, whereas in the simile it is not. The deletion of the tertium comparationis in the surface structure 273</page><page sequence="10">makes a simile more subtle: only from the context of the sentence in the surface structure can we reconstruct the missing link, by comparing the semantic markers of the correlated lexical items and by attributing to them associative features derived from the whole sentence. In terms of transformational syntax the compari- son may be understood as an intensifier. i. John works as hard as a miner vs. John works extremely hard. ii. John works like a horse. iii. John works like a machine. Sentence ii. compares John [ + human] to an animal. As both nouns belong to the category animate, their semantic tension is not so strong as in iii., where the semantic distance between human (John) and artefact (machine) is greater. The common element in ii. and iii. results from the semantics of the sentence, which is the interrelation of a bundle of semantic features which we empirically attribute to horse and machine: horse: animal, quadruped, mammal, . . . domestic animal, working hard, obediently, incessantly . . . machine: physical object, artefact material, labour device. . . labour- and time-saving, effective, powerful . . . For the purpose of stylistic interpretation, the categories human , animal, and artefact are obviously insufficient; the comparison proper is established on grounds of more delicate semantic fea- tures from which the tertium comparationis (= T.C.) is derived. Which semantic element is fitted in as the missing link is a matter of experience and of individual interpretation and associa- tion. At any rate, the relevant features are not so much the categorical markers as the non-hierarchical features (in terms of Fodor-Katz "distinguishers"). Therefore in the simile under discussion such categorical features as animal, mammal, artefact, labour device are of minor importance for the understanding and interpretation. The relevant features which account for the effect of a simile can be understood as a non-hierarchical list, being correlated in the way of a logical conjunction. As a very illustrative example I quote an advertising slogan from The Observer. 274</page><page sequence="11">An Exciting Advance in Skin Care MOISTURA by Cyclax Acts Like Magic on Tired Skin. This simile is rather complicated because of its different embedd- ings. The T.C. is not represented in the surface structure. It can only be inserted hypothetically in the deep structure, as a dummy symbol in the base phrase marker, functioning as an adverbial of manner which we derive from the associative features of the lexical item Magic (unbelievable, wonderful, irresistible. . .). The tree diagram illustrates the various levels of embedding and the transformation mechanism. The semantic tension is based on the distance of the two lexical items in the tree diagram (MOISTURA [artefact material] magic [non-concrete / static] ). 275</page><page sequence="12">-O . -O ž-f- I 1 - Ä ^ g to o« 2 .. gÇg-g-a ^ g to - g o« .3 tí g &lt;•-» «■* Ok Ou § 0 / /* I-I s á w § 0 / « s w 1 ff3-|TŽTīL ļļt ■ ā ir" ff3-|TŽTīL i-i î fi »2 Z o- ©■ L&gt;-~ * ^ 2 3 * I z * * /S-8 I 8 s ; : , I fê-jr^'î *i 888 .1« $ Jo /g/ rßä-&lt;:' zrz - f-j e ■** 888 •■• ■ Jo /g/ e zrz - e g á Jo 1 /(l-M /g/ e zrz e i g i j( V*.« i / / V 2- S- « - g- . a / §T ■§ 8 •§ 8 • / / &lt;3 2- -m S- g- - Q&lt; . a dt Ať / ■§ •§ Q&gt; • / &lt;3 -m Q&lt; dt Ať ■ o o «3 Q&gt; • / / &lt;3 -m Q&lt; dt /' Ať « ■ ï o Ï o -' ' /íí lij ' ^ O U U ON o ' c/3 ^ ^ ^'1 c&lt;!

The semantic tension depends on the proximity or remoteness of the prevailing semantic markers of the nouns concerned, according to our suggested tree diagram. G. Durrell, My Family and Other Animals'. Our rivers were wide, and blue as forget-me-nots, freckled with canoes and crocodiles. D. H. Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's Lover: My heart is numb as a potato. Journalism: Alan Warner, A Short Guide to English Style: In the long run I think that prose, like peace, is indivisible. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies: A tree exploded in the fire like a bomb. (In this example the T.C. can only be derived from the verb). L. Durrell, Justine: The house was perpetually alive to the fern-like pattern of a quartet, or to the foundering plunge of saxophones crying to the night like cuckolds. Newspaper text: The Listener: Economists study statistics, not human beings. For the sociologist, men in houses are like rats in mazes. A. Sillitoe, Key to the Door: Sweat, helped by the high up blistering sun, poured out of him like a refugee soul. The semantic proximity between the nouns compared is greater in the relation men-rats than in saxophones - cuckolds where there is in fact no natural similarity, unless we restore the missing link from the context of the verb; the T.C. thus serves as an adver- bial of manner (cry shrilly, hysterically, whiningly...). Intuitively, we feel that the similes comparing MOISTURA and magic, sweat and refugee soul, prose and peace are rather arbitrary, far-fetched and even incompatible. Our empirical competence tells us that there is no natural link between saxophones and cuckolds, sweat and refugee soul, but that there may be common features between men and rats, blue rivers and forget-me-nots, a numb heart and a potato. The principle of semantic proximity and remoteness which we tried to derive from the above-mentioned cases has not 277</page><page sequence="14">yet been formulated, although it was approached in previous studies. What R. A. Sayce has remarked about the semantic relations in a metaphor has also some bearing on the simile. In his book, Style in French Prose (1961, p. 45) he writes that the " 'angle' of the metaphor (angle of the image)" should be wide enough to attract the reader's attention. Too much similarity between two nouns forming a metaphor or a simile, would be trite and boring. In terms of generative transformational grammar, the opinion held by Sayce and backed by Stephen Ullmann means that the stylistic effect of a simile or a metaphor increases with the semantic remoteness of the nouns compared. The stemma of the semantic classification of nouns thus seems to provide an objective criterion for this relation and for the subsequent stylistic interpretation. The tree diagram, furthermore, helps us in the analysis of other figures of speech, especially various kinds of metaphors such as personification (anthropomorphism) and animal metaphor ("animalification"). In nominal metaphors the identity between two correlated nouns is expressed in the surface structure by such verbs as to be, become, turn, grow, remain, etc.; the T.C. is always absent. The semantic proximity or remoteness results from the categorical markers plus the additional associative, idiosyncratic features of the nouns. Metaphors are generated in the deep structure. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies: Ralph was a shock of hair and Piggy a bag of fat" " L. Durrell: His real life became a buried stream. Relations of remoteness like these may occur in transforms with post-nominal modifiers as for instance, He was a dead fish of a gentleman. Animal metaphors and anthropomorphisms are generally based on verbs. These are characterized by the selectional restrictions (human or animal agent). Apart from their context-sensitive semantic markers, these verbs may be classified in subgroups according to subordinate inherent semantic features. Anthropomorphisms or personifications are based on verbs with the categorical contextual feature [human]. Morton M. 278</page><page sequence="15">Bloomfíeld has emphasized13 that personifications are formed by verbs rather than nouns. In poetic texts and in prose writing we find recurrent patterns of semantic transfer which may be relevant in, and characteristic of, a future poetic glossary; i.e., selectional rules in a special register or functional variety. Verbs of human vocal utterance and communication (such as to whisper, murmur, shout) occur with human agents, even with such nouns which are characterized by the absence of sound production. cicada waters Whisper [+ human] is collocated with wind waltz heart The semantic remoteness between heart and whisper is much greater than between waters, wind + whisper. We are inclined to accept these examples as empirically correct, since in our empirical competence they fulfil a truth condition: the soft noise of the wind and waters may be identified as, or associated with, a whis- pering sound, which we cannot attribute to heart, and probably not to waltz. Sean O'Casey, Red Roses For Me: 1st Man:. ...Regal and proud She was, an' wondrous, so that me eyes failed; me knees thrembled an' bent low, an' me heart whispered a silent prayer to itself as th' vision passed me by.... John Heath-Stubbs, "The Don Juan Triptych," Selected Poems: And he can remember that night when he stood on the terrace Sunning himself in the black beams of vicarious sin, While the waltz whispered within.... The collocations of wind, waters and whisper is a violation of selectional rules in terms of generative grammar, they are, how- ever, acceptable on a deep structure underlying that of the base. We may describe this deeper layer as the empirical or cognitive deep structure, a model of the native speaker's empirical or cognitive competence. On this level, such metaphors which Ernst Leisi has aptly called "indirekte Metaphern" (e.g., die Steine schweigen )14 can be interpreted. 279</page><page sequence="16">A similar anthropomorphic transfer occurs in a group of verbs describing emotions (to cry, weep, rage, sigh etc.). Colloca- tions with sigh are manifold: waters trees ... fields + ... M8h trousers The first three examples show a semantic proximity in the sense of an indirect metaphor, whereas the selection of trousers + sigh strikes us as far-fetched. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies: Maurice's trousers gave way with a sigh and he abandoned them as a wreck... (Sigh is represented in a nominalization transformation; the semantic remoteness remains the same). Incompatible are such combinations as "Comets weep" (T.S. Eliot), "my blood cries" (J. Heath-Stubbs), and "the moon rages" (Dylan Thomas). Animal metaphors are also based on deviations from selec- tional rules in that way. Verbs and adjectives with the restriction to a noun with the semantic marker [ + animal] are transferred to lifeless objects. In handbooks on style, this figure of speech is hardly ever mentioned. Only Jerome Beaty and William H. Matchett ( Poetry - From Statement to Meaning, OUP, 1965) point out that there is a gap in terminology: "We have no word like 'animalification' to describe the comparable (if not identical) process by which a lifeless object is given the attributes of a beast" (p. 233). Verbs of animal movements are for instance combined with nouns not having the semantic marker [animal] (to crawl, gallop) V. Woolf, The Waves: . Words and words and words, how they gallop- haw they lash their long manes and tails.... John Wain, Hurry On Down: ...the phrases that insistently barked inside his brain. In the case of verbs of animal voices, when to roar is combined with tram, bus, wind, one can recognize a semantic proximity; whereas the sentences "the blood roared in Ralph's ears" (W. Golding, Lord of the Flies) and "Now hot towels envelop me, 280</page><page sequence="17">and their roughness, as I rub my back, makes my blood purr " (V. Woolf, The Waves), seem to be semantically incompatible. What strikes us most is the recurrence of a number of such figures in literary texts, as cliche's of poetic licence. "Waves" and "water", collocated with verbs such as "to hobble" and "to leap" are nearly predictable. Selectional rules of the micro- linguistic model of the base as presented in the Standard Theory could obviously be completed by sub-rules of poetic usage, operating on a different level of grammaticalness. Conclusion In conclusion we can state that the concept of deep and surface structure can help us, as a sort of discovery procedure, to find out regularities of semantic transfer which underlie various figures of speech. It is important to note that not all deviations from selectional rules create a metaphor or a simile. Random selections of lexical items are not yet a metaphorical string. Apart from the semantic proximity or remoteness of the categorical semantic markers, there must be a minimum of semantic corre- spondence between the idiosyncratic semantic features of the lexical items compared. Besides inherent (categorical) features we need associative, contextual features for stylistic interpretation. These are derived from our empirical competence. The poetic transfers discussed in this article give rise to the assumption that we can set up a lexicon of poetic collocations which occur either in similes or metaphors. The material for such a corpus could be drawn from an analysis of various kinds of texts, ranging from poetry and prose fiction to scientific prose. In literary texts semantic transfers may be predictable to a certain extent. By means of close reading a number of recurrent patterns of poetic transfers can be easily distinguished. When some basic types of poetic collocations are evident, they can be illustrated by new material. In certain poetic texts they may have a high degree of probability. A future lexicon of poetic collocations could be arranged either alphabetically or as a thesaurus. At any rate, the spadework needed for such a project would contribute to the endeavours of the lexicographer who has to list transferred 281</page><page sequence="18">usages. Undoubtedly the concept of transformational generative grammar has provided new methods for style analysis. Much basic work remains to be done to demonstrate the explanatory power of the Standard Theory in the field of text analysis, let alone text generation. The application of this theory to the description of tropes is one more evidence for its heuristic value. NOTES 1The M.I.T.
