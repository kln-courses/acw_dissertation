<plain_text><page sequence="1">218 Journal of Religion and Health The Research Ministry: A New Concept for a Hospital Chaplaincy EDMOND PHILLIPS Can a minister be a research scientist? Would he be able to do valid scientific research that is relevant both to his own field of religion and to the biological and behavioral sciences? Most research workers in the various branches of science are likely to respond to questions like these with wonderment, skepticism, or undisguised amusement. Those who have heard such an idea before may be moved to repeat the story about the clergyman who had four children but baptized only two, because the other two were his "controls." Or they may recall another apocryphal tale about the ecclesiastic whose agricultural experiment yielded better-growing plants in the plot over which he prayed regularly than in the control plot that did not have the benefit of his prayers. That is about as far as the average research scientist would probably care to pursue the question of ministerial research. The idea of scientific research in religion by a clergyman trained in scientific methods is still so new to most people that there is considerable need to explain and justify any proposal for such a program. The author thanks Chaplains Raymar E. Robber and Roy F. Reynolds for their interest and support during the development of this paper. Edmond Phillips, D.S.W., is Research Social Worker at Jefferson Barracks Veter ans Administration Hospital, St. Louis, Mo.</page><page sequence="2">The Research Ministry 219 This article presents the rationale offered in a recent successful attempt to justify religious research in a large medical organization that was considering the creation of a position for a research chaplain. It is a research prospectus outlining what a research chaplain might do, the problem areas he might in vestigate, and a rationale justifying the selection of a properly qualified clergy man to conduct the appropriate scientific investigations. While the religious mission of hospital chaplains transcends the secular treatment goals of the hospital program, there is an area of overlap between the broad mission of the religious ministry and the over-all treatment-care mission of medical institutions. It is in this area of overlap that an area of research can be carved out for a new role: that of research chaplain. We can see this area of overlap more clearly if we briefly examine the medical concept of "total patient care." Total care extends the concern for the health of patients to a concern for their general welfare, which includes their spiritual welfare. Concern for their welfare has required the provision of opportunities for meeting patients' nonmedical needs, including religious needs. Emphasis on total care derives from a concept of a man as an integrated system that can be viewed from various orientations?physical, chemical, bio logical, social, psychological. The interrelatedness of all aspects of the "whole man" assures that effects produced in one aspect are correlated with conse quences seen in other aspects of the functioning human being. Thus medical approaches are supplemented by other special approaches in order to in crease the probability of attaining desired and unified results in the care and treatment of a patient. But the broad area of patient welfare is not simply made up of the special concerns of each discipline. The special interests do not merely supplement each other. They also intersect, to the extent that they are concerned about the patient as a whole and insofar as they share the common "therapeutic" goals of strengthening the individual's ability to use his own resources and to cope with the world. While these objectives fit differently into the over-all purpose of each discipline, they furnish a common ground for communication</page><page sequence="3">220 Journal of Religion and Health among disciplines. The questions and resources that each discipline can bring to this area of mutual concern lay the groundwork for research activities through which each profession, including the ministry, can contribute new knowledge and new skills that are of benefit to all concerned. Therefore, each discipline should be interested in the contribution of the others to the common pool of knowledge. Scientifically oriented workers in the health field who view religion as a resource are interested in knowing how spiritual undertakings serve a thera peutic function in the treatment of patients. These other specialists usually have a pragmatic interest in the uses and values of religious faith and prac tices without concern about whether religion is an illusion. They recognize its status as a social institution with important value for society. Some of them believe that it has psychological survival value; they even think that religion itself has survived because it developed in response to man's unique personal ity needs. At least one theoretical model for personality studies (Angyal's) postulates that there is a basic trend in every human being to become part of something he conceives as greater than himself, with the clearest (though not only) manifestation of the tendency being found in the religious attitude and religious experience.1 Most hospital patients are to some extent religious, or at least identify themselves with some religious group. For many, religion is an important dimension of their lives. Some experience existential problems in explicitly religious terms. Perhaps all of them struggle with difficulties that implicitly fall within the scope of a broad thesis of religion (such as Edward Spranger's definition of religion as a sense of unity of all things.2 Federal and state hospital systems have long recognized the importance and value of a religious ministry in the total care and treatment of patients. The time has come to recognize the relevance of research into the "religious factor" in the lives of patients receiving hospital care. And that research can best be done by an appropriately trained research chaplain. Present medical and paramedical research efforts should be supplemented by special research inquiries conducted by "religionists," so as to increase the probability of at</page><page sequence="4">The Research Ministry 221 taining an integrated understanding of the total functioning human being? which is a prerequisite to knowing how best to serve him. The full utilization of the concept of total care will require the develop ment of a companion concept in the area of scientific research, namely, the concept of "total investigation." Not only should each hospital discipline be expected to make its special contribution to total patient care, but it should also be given the opportunity to make its own special contribution to the total study of problems that arise in the context of total patient care. A chaplain service is no exception to the principle that each discipline in the hospital setting, if it is to be a dynamic professional service, needs to keep its knowledge base constantly developing, by its own efforts and with whatever tools it can use. Outside of hospitals, research methods are current ly being applied by religionists themselves in scientific study of religious phenomena, behavior, and problems. Despite their large importance in life, religious behavior and phenomena comprise a peripheral and subordinate area in most conceptual schemes and investigations of the behavioral and social sciences. When the area of religion is studied, the research problems are usually formulated from the viewpoint of a discipline other than the ministry. In their encounter with science, reli gious concepts have often suffered the fate of being psychologized or so ciologized. For example, Samuel Klausner?even though he noted the de sirability of giving equal status to religious concepts?fell back upon the social system theory of his own discipline, sociology, to provide concepts that encompassed some aspects of both religion and psychiatry, when he studied the relations between clergymen and psychiatrists in a newly developed re ligio-psychiatric clinic.3 What is studied peripherally by other disciplines would be studied centrally by a research chaplain. The subject matter of religion deserves the full re search attention of some one discipline, because religion is so important in life. In study after study, the religious factor appears as one of the most im portant predictors of other forms of social behavior.4 There is a positive correlation between religion and adjustment.</page><page sequence="5">222 Jaumal of Religion and Health It is axiomatic that any phenomenon can be studied from many viewpoints. Certainly, clearly recognized religious phenomena could be better under stood by science with the help of those who are most familiar with the content and meaning of religion. Theology should help to give some conception of what a religious experience is.5 There is some point in trying "to understand real religious content and its meaning before we experiment on it," within the social sciences.6 The common "cause" of all the health professions could probably be served best by a broader definition of religious concepts (re ligion, religious welfare, needs, attitudes, experience), not one narrowly construed in institutional terms or limited to such notions as church affilia tion, attendance, or formal and conventional doctrinal beliefs, although these should not be left out in formulating the distinctive focus of a research chap lain. A conception of religion in nonformal terms is analogous to a conception of, say, political science that defines the field in terms of the power element in social relations wherever it may be found, not only in the formal political structure. Researchers into problems of religious behavior and beliefs will need to develop both conceptual frameworks and methods relevant to their subject, instead of merely borrowing what they consider appropriate from psychology and sociology or some other discipline.7 There is, of course, a place for social science notions and methods, but research innovation?conceptual and methodological (such as one researcher's construction of a "moral index" used to measure the "morality" of a community)?is desirable in the study of religion, insofar as religious experience is in a unique mode. In other words, as Seward Hiltner, among others, has pointed out, a research program in this area does not have to be limited to the exploration of only those problems for which the tools are already available in advance.8 The religious and theological background of a research chaplain would pro vide some unique resources for coping with practical, methodological prob lems as well as the unresolved conceptual problems that plague the more sophisticated studies of religious phenomena and behavior. From the practical side, a deep familiarity with the area gives the religionist a superior poten</page><page sequence="6">The Research Ministry 223 tiality for imaginative use of religiously oriented materials in his research pro cedures. He is likely to have an intimate acquaintance with religious activities, teachings, feelings, perhaps Bible passages, hymns, sermon topics, and religious symbols in general. For his study designs, he can draw on a larger range of information from his field, which is not as accessible to other specialists or "generalists." But more important than the familiarity with religious "tools" is the chap lain's superior grasp of religious concepts. Research workers are struggling for conceptual clarity concerning the domain of religion. Social scientists and psychiatrists are uncertain about their present conceptualizations of religion. They are wondering if religion should be treated as a single, quantifiable en tity, or as a number of different things to be measured separately, and whether religious behavior is differentiated sharply from other forms of behavior, perhaps by its special properties or by a special patterning of characteristics.9 One of the major issues is the problem of getting a researchable concept of religion that has significance for both social scientists and religionists. As Gordon Allport has pointed out, there is "real error in using church attendance as a criterion of religiousness"10; there has been a need for the development of more adequate, standardized indicators of religion and re ligious behavior. Allport has reported the difficulty that social scientists have in finding any kind of measure for "intrinsic," as opposed to "extrinsic," religion?a dis tinction between the "more" and "less" religious, based on the difference be tween the personal or "inward" meaning of religion and adherence to "out ward" religious forms.11 Research to discover some kind of reliable measure ment of the intrinsic and extrinsic qualities has been termed "most dif ficult and most necessary."12 It has been suggested that intrinsic religion might best be approached from the viewpoint of spiritual directors and counselors, and that they "would be much better able to provide a rating scale or objective index" of the religious behavior of people.13 They already make intuitive distinctions between more religious and less religious churchgoers who would measure equally religious</page><page sequence="7">224 Journal of Religion and Health on existing scales. It has been conjectured that "a religious sentiment is so private, personal, and intimate, a person resists as an intrusion any attempt to probe it," although "people are willing to declare themselves with ref erence to obvious behavior characteristics, and hence are likely to respond reasonably well to self-report inventories dealing with external religious be havior."14 It is easy to see how one who himself shares such a sentiment might gain better access to it in another person. For Allport, the central question in the psychology of religion is: "why are some people religious and others not, and are they intrinsically or ex trinsically religious?" (The next question that has been asked is: Why are they so?because of constitutional factors, early upbringing, or what?)15 The social psychologist's dichotomy of extrinsic and intrinsic religion need not restrain the research chaplain from exploring alternative classifications de riving from theological sources, such as the typology developed by theologian Richard Niebuhr in his book, Christ and Culture.1* Religion has its psychological and sociological dimensions, and for study of them the vocabularies of psychology and sociology may provide a fairly ade quate research language. But it also seems likely that there is a place for an other language that is neither psychological nor sociological (perhaps is not even the present religious one), and that will be used in studies conducted on the basis of important theological ideas?studies that will also have great relevance for medicine, psychiatry, psychology, sociology, and social work. This relevance seems guaranteed in advance when the chaplain seeks, through his research, to tell psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists what they want to know about religion. But the problems and questions to which re search projects are addressed should also be of central concern to the chap lain's own profession. His methodological concepts, on the other hand, may come largely from the language of social science. The strategy of a research chaplain seeking an adequate and unique definition of religion might be to proceed in the accepted fashion of first identifying a number of dimensions of religious behavior, setting up scales for measuring them, and then analyzing his results factorially</page><page sequence="8">The Research Ministry 225 to see which of the variables go together.17 The scales might prove very use ful in differentiating individuals according to their religious capacity or ability ?a point of great importance in the hospital chaplain's work. The scales might also serve as a basis for studying the conditions that lead people to be high or low on certain dimensions or the conditions that facilitate or hinder the development of individuals along particular dimensions.18 The area of "basic" research has already been opened up by the foregoing discussion of a major "measurement" problem, which is characteristic of a research approach. Research is usually broken down into "problem areas," both methodological and substantive. It is often possible to investigate much the same problem under a number of different program titles?in our case, such headings as religion and mental health (or just "health"), religion and aging, or religion and social attitudes. A more inclusive area of research might be called "pastorology"?the scientific study of the professional activities of pastors and chaplains.* There is no reason why a beginning prospectus like this one should be limited to a single area of research. It seems unlikely that the important questions in a new field of research will lie within any preconceived boun daries drawn for other kinds of research. It may, however, become desirable (and necessary) for a researcher to develop his first projects around questions that fall into an area of current public interest where work is already being done by other disciplines with which the research chaplain will be associated. One relatively new scientific area, the field of aging research, is now being developed intensively by specialists from a variety of disciplines. Gerontology offers an excellent opportunity for religious research. The following collection of research questions, suitable for a research chaplain to investigate, goes beyond the scope of a clinical research program on aging. However, the listing is not comprehensive; it is only representative of some of the leading thought in a broad field that is known as "the scientific study of religion." * A term suggested by Leonard F. Jakubczak, a V. A. research psychologist.</page><page sequence="9">226 Journal of Religion and Health The question of health and pathology in religious experience has been iden tified as the most fundamental and neglected problem in the domain of theology and the behavioral sciences. It is a persistent problem in psychiatric hospitals to determine if a psy chotic patient can communicate validly to any degree on the religious level with a priest, rabbi, or minister. Some clergymen doubt that anyone dis turbed enough to require psychiatric hospitalization is functioning normally on the religious level.19 We do not have the needed criteria to distinguish between healthy and un healthy forms of experiences that appear, or profess to be, religious in nature. Chaplains in psychiatric hospitals face the problem of differentiating normal from abnormal religious experience of seriously disturbed patients; it may be a question of separating an authentic religious experience from hallucina tory or delusional symptoms, or from the effect of drugs.20 Or it may be a far more subtle and complicated problem, if we can believe Anton Boisen, the "father of pastoral counseling," who experienced a mental illness him self and wrote about it. He is said to have maintained, "In many kinds of behavior now classified as psychopathological, there is a constructive force or drive that can be understood only in a religious context."21 The Rev. Noel Mailloux has suggested: "the content of religious delusions should be studied, not just from the psychological viewpoint, but also in the light of a thorough theological interpretation."22 Now theological analysis can supplement the psychological and logical study of schizophrenic ideation or thinking. The religious content, as well as the emotional motivation behind it, can be examined from a theological viewpoint. The distortions of religious concepts by psychotics (and neurotics) could be analyzed. These analyses would provide suggestions for further research into the question of how psychotic disturbances might be controlled by prac tices and symbols of a patient's religious upbringing.23 It would also be possible to investigate how religion may provide stability for some patients in deal ing with their mental problems after they leave the hospital. Another project might investigate the relation between a person's re</page><page sequence="10">The Research Ministry 227 ligious beliefs and the type of mental illness or symptoms he develops. For example, one might hypothesize that a punitive religion would be correlated with a depressive illness.24 Or the hypothesis might be that patients' views of the central message of religion are associated with their diagnoses or symp tomatology. Case studies could be made of patients for whom religion ap pears to have been a factor in the cause or resolution of their problems.25 The clinical professions would, of course, be interested in any studies that would show if and how religious belief as such may speed the recovery of those who are mentally ill. "The core of the problem of religious psychopathology" that has not been studied concerns the "perception of the self as independent from conduct."26 This distinction between "being" and "doing" is subsumed in such maxims as loving a person for his human dignity and worth, regardless of how badly he behaves. Father Mailloux has raised these relevant questions: To what extent are schizophrenics able to say, "I did the wrong thing," instead of always saying, "I am bad"? And to what extent can they begin to differentiate be tween degrees of wrongness or badness?"this was a serious offense" and "that was a minor one"?27 What kind of theology should be offered to patients functioning at an in fantile level? There is a need for studies to assess the "capacity" of mental patients to relate to religious phenomena. The development of some suitable index of religious capacity, or "ability," would make it possible to map out a religious program related to the capacities of patients. It would be a "dif ferential" religious approach to the patient. His religious capacity could then be used appropriately toward improved health and human realization. Pastoral counseling is an important area of the chaplain's ministry. There fore, a relevant area of research is the nature of the pastoral-patient rela tionship and the healing resources that are available through it. In pastoral counseling there is confusion about what ministers can do and uncertainty about how to use their theological concern effectively in an organized, dis ciplined way so as to be most helpful to people in trouble. God-centered ministers committed to religious values are often not equipped to help direct</page><page sequence="11">228 Journal of Religion and Health ly with existential problems. Studies of how the clergyman sees himself and of the patients' perception of the chaplain may clarify the nature of the chaplain's supportive role. The symbolic aspect of the relationship can be studied to determine if (and what) effects derive primarily from the clergy man as a symbol. This would be a study of "the kind of ethos the clergyman brings to his role," as priest ("father," symbolizing a parent-child relation ship), rabbi ("teacher," perhaps a teacher-pupil relationship), or reverend ("holy person," a lay-holy relationship) ,28 Pastoral counseling can be served by a study of how religion comes up and is handled in other forms of therapy. This would involve questions of the therapists' knowledge about religion and the range of attitudes of therapists toward religion (animism-anthropomorphism, "opiate of the people," "a neurosis," magical belief and practice of "superstition," epileptiform-ecstatic). Degrees of confidence in therapists and coincidence of religious backgrounds may be studied. One study of the cleric as an independent variable in psy chological testing suggests a difference in readiness to make self-revelations to a clergyman versus a lay psychologist. It would be interesting to have a study of "the atheistic (or agnostic) therapist and the religious patient." The "health" professions are probably less adequate with respect to the issues around religious faith than in other areas like sex or aggression. How religion is viewed and handled, or mishandled, by therapists may prove to be sig nificantly related to therapeutic outcome, and a correlation of this sort would suggest the need for the clergyman's greater involvement in some way, either educationally or in collaborative counseling. Even though involvement of the religious element seems to be a strong stabilizing influence, religious leaders have recommended further exploration of the positive correlation between religious activity and adjustment. They feel that studies of the relation between religion and adjustment do not press deeply enough into the problem. The great increase in the number of older people in the population provides the opportunity to study the meaning to older people of their own religious behavior. One could study the religious resources, needs, capacities, and experiences of public welfare, state hospital and Veterans Administration beneficiaries in nursing homes and foster homes,</page><page sequence="12">The Research Ministry 229 to learn if the religious factor has a differential effect on survival, self-care dependency, and "senility." Co-operative studies might be worked out among a number of chaplains who are operating in the different programs. Some ecclesiastics feel that there may be some unique expectations directed toward the counseling process when it is conducted by a clergyman. For example, they believe that, particularly in the noninstitutional circumstances, other professional people need an invitation, but the pastor may move into the lives of people without an invitation. This follows the model that tradition ally the pastor's visitation to parishioners' homes is always unannounced. Do patients tend to feel that everyone in the hospital except the chaplains is making demands on them? If so, does this differential create a special therapeutic opportunity for the chaplain, and how does he make use of it? The "life review" has been identified as an important phenomenon of ag ing, occurring in both middle and later years of life.29 This is recognized in the Veterans Administration Chaplain Service Manual, which states: "A pe riod of hospitalization is often a time of reappraisal of a person's whole life."30 The basis of life review in the aged is the sense of impending death. Death and dying are areas with respect to which clergymen are especially equipped to function. Their research contribution would not be crippled by the taboos that cause most social scientists to avoid the subject of death. One of the serious problems that ministers face as squarely within their function is what to do for persons who, either because of age, limited en dowment, or presence of other crippling defects, need continuing support, without hope of full recovery. Other professions are willing to leave the "hopeless" case and the "terminal" patient to the ministrations of the clergy. The others lack the resources, and perhaps, therefore, the interest, to do any thing more that they consider valuable. Thus the clergyman, primarily be cause of his particular values, becomes the best equipped person to give continual help in a "ministry of sustaining" to the person who cannot get better. Care replaces treatment. The ministry would welcome more knowledge to practice by in this area. Research that shows how patients die?with what awarenesses, under what conditions, and with what effects on survivors?may help policy makers</page><page sequence="13">230 Journal of Religion and Health understand the significance of transferring patients to nursing homes to die, and, in general, how the concept of "care" can be extended to "helping a pa tient die in dignity." Social and psychological "disengagement" of the older person may con serve his energies for the task of life reappraisal, an often private or semi conscious experience that provides a r?int?gration of personality in prepara tion for death. More information about this process, obtained through re search projects, can help spiritual advisors recognize what they can do to intervene in the process when it is following a destructive course. The prob lem, again, is to find indices by which to gauge the need of patients with varying degrees of religious orientation. Religious needs are probably not static, and so cross-sectional or longitud inal studies could be planned to investigate age changes in religious attitudes and experience. One such hypothesis is: As a person ages, his religious con cepts change. The Rev. Isidore Langheim and others have suggested studies of several related hypotheses (significant to aging and the chronic disease program both), which can be summarized in the proposition that patients with a re ligious concept of life after death, or with high religious values, face old age, confinement, and death with less emotional conflict, anxiety, guilt feelings, depression, and hostility than do patients who have no religious concept of after-life or who are low in religious values.31 The researchable nature of these issues is illustrated by the findings that Herman Feifel quotes, to the effect that "The religious person, when compared to the non-religious in dividual, is personally more afraid of death."32 Such studies need to be rep licated before their findings can be considered conclusive. Subjects in a "death-coping" study could be obtained at the time of hos pital admission from a high death-risk group, or those could be tested who are diagnosed as terminal, with tests or structured interviews being conducted when the patient is first diagnosed as terminal, then after he becomes aware of the prognosis, and, finally, before he dies. Such a study could be carried on in collaboration with social workers and psychologists, the latter group</page><page sequence="14">The Research Ministry 231 assisting in the administration of certain psychological tests (which might be serving their own independent investigative purposes at the same time). Predictor measures for religious values could be derived from instruments like the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values, Religious Pro j ?crive Pic tures (Godin of Brussels, Belgium), and a schedule for a structured inter view containing appropriately selected items. The criteria measures and test ing instruments could include (besides the structured interview) : anxiety? IP AT Self Analysis (or 16 Personality Factors), Taylor Manifest anxiety on MMPI; depression?O of IPAT; hostility?Cook-Medley Hostility scale of MMPI; guilt feelings?O of IPAT and Pharisaic Virtue Scale of MMPI by Cook-Medley. Statistical methods for analysis of data could include Bi-serial or Multiple Correlation.33 One of the most important professional goals of the research chaplain is to integrate knowledge from medical and behavioral sciences with theological understanding. Science is never closed to new concepts, new approaches, and new domains of phenomena to be studied. It does insist on tying the theoret ical to the empirical, to supply the evidential weights for its explanatory concepts and propositions. In principle, this process has never been foreign to religionists. They have often insisted on intersubjective evidence of man's interaction with a theoretically postulated divine realm. For example, in Western society the validity of a man's mystical experience is usually as sessed on the basis of observable changes in his daily behavior. He must display "heroic virtues" or manifest "highly moral conduct."34 A "research ministry" would help to release more of the potential for good that exists in the minister's perspective. It "can help him visualize the even tual goals of the whole healing procedure and its outcomes. He can also raise pertinent questions concerning the relationships between psychotherapy and value systems, concerning the basic nature of mental illness, and concerning the perspectives of psychiatry, philosophy, theology and religion."35 References 1.
