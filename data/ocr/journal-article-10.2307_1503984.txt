<plain_text><page sequence="1">Children's Books by Russian Emigre Artists: 1921-1940 By A.L. de Saint-Rat Born in 1918, A.L. de Saint-Rat is a specialist in Russian and Soviet history. A former professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, he has a particular interest in graphics and stage design and collects Russian illustrated books of the early twentieth century. r i ~ ..;ew art historians would deny that the two distinctive contributions of the World of Art society were stage design and book illustration. If Leon Bakst's scenery and costumes for the Ballets Russes dazzled Parisian audiences, the consummate graphic artistry of Ivan Bilibin, Alexandre Benois, Konstantin Somov, and Georgii Narbut delighted the cultural elite of St. Petersburg, Moscow, and other urban centers. Nowhere is this graphic excellence more striking than in the realm of fine chil- dren's books. Whoever has not leafed through the pages of Bilibin-illustrated Vasilisa the Beautiful (Vasilisa-Prekrasnaia) or The Frog Princess (Tsaret,na- Liagushka) published by the Department of Printing of State Papers has missed a fundamental ingredient of Russian fairy tales. Has anyone who has had the rare privilege of holding Benois' Alphabet in Pictures (Azbuka vt kartinakh) in his hands failed to notice a quickened heartbeat? Who could be immune to the charm of Narbut's The Toys (Igrushki)? The October Revolution, with its attendant destruction of private libraries and confiscation of private presses, stocks of paper, and printing equipment, rang the death knell for Golike and Vilborg, Knebel, and the Department of Printing of State Papers. One shudders at the thought that for years Russian families stoked their stoves (burzhuiki) with books in order to keep from freezing. Five long years of nightmare would slowly pass before Vladimir Lebedev's books opened up an entirely new chapter in the world of Russian juveniles. The large-scale exodus of Russia's cultured classes and their arrival in Western Europe created both new problems and new opportunities. Their first stop was Berlin, and the old German city was soon transformed into a Russian mini- capital. Russian Berlin became a haven for writers, artists, and political figures of every stripe. Officers and men of the various White Armies would rub shoul- ders, sometimes rather uneasily, with intellectuals. As the refugee population grew, publishing companies mushroomed. Works of literature, history, mem- oirs, and politics as well as periodicals, textbooks, and art books came out by the hundreds to satisfy the cultural hunger of thousands and thousands of refu- gees and the interest of German readers thrilled by all things Russian. Until 1924 Berlin was, indeed, the capital of Russian publishing in exile, producing some splendid editions, now highly prized and steeply priced both in the West and the Soviet Union. Four Berlin-based Russian-German publishers stand out for the splendid qual- ity of their illustrated editions: Neva, Petropolis, Gelikon, and the Grzhebin House. In Munich, Orchis ran a close second. Other smaller Berlin-based 92 DAPA Winter 1989 'i C</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1.

Various publishers produced some of Boris Grigoriev's best graphics. Orchis, among other things, treated us to The Lal, of Igor (Die Mdr von derHeerfahrt Igors), undoubtedly one of Natalia Goncharova's gems. Neva, however, must be ranked first for the sheer number of superlative graphic works done by the recently rediscovered Vasilii Masiutin. If time, the cultural horrors of national socialism, and the ravages of war have made such works great rarities, one can well imagine that artistic children's books, by their nature fragile and perishable, have vanished almost without a trace. While their number was, indeed, very small, their quality was unusually high. Few would have expected that Boris Grigoriev, the Russian Toulouse-Lautrec, would have shifted from his usual scenes of lust, brutality, and degeneracy to the innocence of the children's world. This, however, he did in his expressionist illustrations to Sasha Chernvi's spirited nonsense verses from Children s Island (Detskii ostrov). Whether it be toys, animals, or human beings, Grigoriev brings to this work-the first truly modernist Russian children's book in exile-his usual economy of line, unsurpassed draftsmanship, and the ability to combine art and literature into a meaningful introduction to the natural world. In doing so, he set the stage for the Paris group of Russian emigre illustrators such as Feodor Rojankovsky, Nathalie Parain, Helene Guertik, AlexandreJacovleff, and the incomparable Alexandra Exter. Both storks and crocodiles bear witness to Boris Grigoriev's talent in rendering the true appearance of animals with striking anatomical accuracy and grace (figs. 1 and 2). If Grigoriev's crocodiles tingled the spine of curious children afraid of being gobbled up whole, countless youngsters "devoured" Kornei DAPA Winter 1989 93</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3.

Chukovsky's The Crocodile (Krokodil), illustrated by Re-mi (pseudonym of Nikolai Remizov), with unmatched glee. After first appearing in the literary sup- plement to Niva in 1917 with Re-mi's illustrations, the work was published in book form by the Soviets in 1919. Epokha produced it in Berlin, 1922, in a mod- ified version. It popped up again in Kharbin in the early thirties, arrived in the United States in 1931, and landed in Great Britain in 1932. In both the United States and Britain it was reproduced without Re-mi's name. This hilarious denizen of the Nile, strutting down Nevskii Boulevard, wreaking havoc in the old Imperial capital, met more than his match in the person of Vania Vasilchikov, a most uncommon child-hero. Journeying back to the Nile, our Krokodil Krokodilovich raised an army of wild beasts to free all animals cooped up in the Petrograd zoo, thereby ending a rip-roaring tale told in rol- licking verse. Ultimately, reconciliation between men and beasts takes place when Krokodil Krokodilovich drinks tea with Vania Vasilchikov. 94 DAPA Winter 1989</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 5. Mstislav Dobujinsky, ""I, handcolored illustration in Hans Christian Andersen, Svinopas (The Swineherd) (Berlin: Z.I. Grzhebin, 1922), p. 4. The designs are dated 1917 but ' were not published until 1922. What was needed for this fast-paced tale was an illustrator who could capture the action, uproarious humor, and underlying gentle philosophy. No one was better suited to this task than Re-mi, a satirist and stage designer of great talent. Utilizing a large oblong format which enables the reader to shift swiftly from page to page with the rhythm of the furious action, Re-mi gave us some thirty- six pages of cartoonlike anthropomorphic figures in which one can easily recognize the foibles of mankind (figs. 3 and 4). Among the Berlin-based publishers who produced high-quality children's books, the palm should go to the Grzhebin House, which between 1922 and 1923 gave us five titles illustrated by Vladimir Konashevich and one by Mstislav Dobujinsky. While the first five are outside the scope of this article, since Konashevich did not emigrate, Dobujinskv's illustrations to Hans Christian Andersen's The Swineherd (Svinopas) deserve attention. This work, delightful in format, design, and spirit, is truly a children's book for adults. The slender, elegant volume embodies all the traditions of the World of Art: congeniality of author and illustrator, fondness for retrospective reverie, theatricality, humor, and decorativeness. What could be more theatrical than the presentation of the gifts to the Emperor (fig. 5) and more humorous than the perfectly synchronized tailpiece and end paper designs (figs. 6 and 7). If decorativeness was of the essence, few artists handled it as well as Sergei Chekhonin, the once-renowned master of the Soviet empire style. In M. Moravskaia's Orange Peels (Apelsinnlia korki), a collection of nonsense verse published circa 1923 by Efron, Chekhonin gives, as usual, a free rein to his bois- terous feel for sheer ornamentation. The illustration for "First Bath" reminds us of the decorated porcelain platters and plates for which he is famous (fig. 8). During their stay in Berlin, Kseniia Boguslavskaia and her husband Ivan Puni jointly illustrated a collection of verse and short stories entitled Pollen (Tsveten). In this venture, Puni displayed his talent as a writer and illustrator by producing an imaginative short story named "The Flying Dutchman." DAPA Winter 1989 95</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 6.

Few artists working in book illustration in the early twenties worked as fe- verishly as Vasilii Masiutin, the uncontested king of Russian illustrators in exile. Of the three children's books he produced between 1922 and 1924, the two by Lev Tolstoi, The Tale of John the Fool (Skazka ob Ivane-Durake) and Selected Tales for the Young (Ausgewdhlte Erzdblungenfiir dieJugend), showed prom- ise; but only in the third, Pushkin's well-known As on a Warm Spring Day (Kak vesennei teploiporoiu), did Masiutin reach his highest level as an illustrator of children's books. Pushkin's mastery of the language found its counterpart in the virtuosity of Masiutin's sharply expressionist talent. This simple and tender story of a bear who has lost his mate to a peasant's hunting spear is best expressed in two of the woodcuts. The child-reader can easily identify with the roughhousing of the three cubs in a clearing under the watchful but indulgent eye of their mother (fig. 10). This is nature at its most idyllic, gentle and smiling, inviting us to share in its beauty and simple joy The second picture is the embodiment of tragedy. The bereaved bear distraught and grief-stricken, sits quietly, surrounded by the indifferent beauty of nature (fig. 12). This charming work, unmentioned in the latest publications on Masiutin, was to be the last truly artistic Russian children's book published in Germany. The economic crisis of 1923 and subsequent political instability led to the de- mise of Russian and Russian-German publishers. The scene was now to shift to Paris, and France was to benefit greatly from the influx of Russian talent. The twenties in France were marked by an extraordinary blossoming of the graphic arts, and Russian artists, for lack of Russian outlets, competed with some of France's greatest talents (Dufy, Derain, Van Dongen, Galanis, Daragnes, and hosts of others) in producing deluxe editions for the French market.

Prince Alexandre Shervashidze produced some delightful handcolored illustrations for Butkovskaia's Russian Folk Tales, Songs, and Jokes (Narodnye russkie skazki, pesni, shutki) and Alice Sauerwein's Four Russian Tales (Quatre contes russes). In both works, Shervashidze used the technique of the popular print (lubok), simplified forms and vibrant colors fortified by the decorativeness of the World of Art (fig. 11). The one work which was to influence the development of French children's books in the thirties went practically unnoticed. Feodor Rojankovsky's illustrations to Sasha Chernyi's Living Alphabet (Zhivaia azbuka) (fig. 13), the fountainhead of many of the famed Plre Castor series of the 1930s, appeared in 1926 and was to be the precursor of the famed ABC Games of Father Beaver (ABCjeux du Pare Castor). While Rojankovsky never reached the superlative level of draftsmanship shown byJacovleff, B. Grigoriev, and V Lebedev, he is, nevertheless, a most impressive observer whose work displays a keen sense of appreciation of the animal world. If France in the twenties was a leader in the field of deluxe editions, her status in the realm of children's books was greatly inferior so inferior that a French observer in the December 1930 issue ofArt et Dcoration sounded the alarm. French children's books could not match British, American, or Soviet publications in text or illustrations.

The French, who had produced Maurice Boutet de Monvel'sJeanne d;Arc and Edy Legrand's Voyages and Glorious Discoveries of the Great French Navigators and Explorers (Voyages et glorieuses decouvertes des grands navigateurs et explorateursfranqais), needed an infusion of new ideas and fresh talent. The effort to rescue children's books from the doldrums was to be a highly cosmopolitan venture and involved three strands: The Domino Press, Flammarion's Pere Castor series, and Gallimard's Tales of the Perched Cat (Les contes du chatperche). The Domino Press, brainchild of two Paris-based American ladies, Miss Esther Averill and Miss Lila Stanley, published in October 1931 (a watershed date) its first book in simultaneous French and English language editions. This was the well-known, often discussed Daniel Boone (fig. 14), illustrated by Feodor Rojankovsky, text printed by Coulouma, and lithography printed by Mourlot- an exemplary collaboration of writer, artist, printer, and lithographer. Even though the book was not a commercial success due to its high price, its appear- ance was a revolutionary event which launched Rojankovskv into his new career and ushered in the renaissance of French children's books. The book itself, a tall, slender album of fourteen pages, introduces the young reader to the great American wilderness. Surrounded by an explosion of gaily colored pictures, a well-printed, highly legible text acquaints the child with Indians, pioneer life, wild animals, hardship, danger, and success. Although the illustrations are stylized, they convey a feeling of action, of life itself, harsh and challenging. This is indeed a book far removed from the now obsolete stories of Madame de Segur. A second work, following in the footsteps of Daniel Boone, was obviously inspired by Lebedev and his The Circus (Tsirk). Powder (Poudre), the story of a young colt that joins the circus to escape the machinations of a wicked old duchess, takes us into the midst of performing animals, clowns, and acrobats. Those of us who remember the last illustration of Tsirk will find a distant echo in Rojankovsky's illustration on the back cover of Poudre (fig. 15). Lebedev's influence had come to France to stayv. While Miss Averill, Miss Stanley, and Rojankovsky were launching their venture, another cosmopolitan team attached to the House of Flammarion was tackling the same problem. Paul Faucher, an editor deeply interested in child psychol- ogy, and his wife Lida Durdikova Faucher, inspired by the well-known Czech educator Frantisek Bakule, conceived a new series of works aimed at develop- ing systematically the imagination, skills, artistic taste, reading ability, and man- ual dexterity of children. The Pere Castor series was born in December 1931, and its team of artists included at one time or another Natan Altman, Bilibin, Exter, Guertik, Parain (formerly a student of VKhUTEMAS), and Rojankovsky. Between 1931 and 1940 the Pere Castor series issued ninety works, forty-nine of which were illustrated by Russian artists. While it would be impossible to discuss each of these individually, let us sample a few and examine their unique contribution. The first, I Make My Masks (Jefais mes masques), the product of Parain's talent, launched the series on its path to national and international rec- ognition (fig. 16). Designed as a magnificently lithographed folio for children aged ten or older, the album is a book of cutouts aimed at stimulating manual DAPA Winter 1989 101</page><page sequence="11">MES MASOUES Fig. 16. Nathalie Parain, lithographed illustration of the back cover for Je fais mes masques (I Make My Masks) (Paris: Flammarion, 1931). Albums du Pere Castor. dexterity, a sense of form and color; and an awareness of physical and cultural differences. Whether the mask be that of a Russian peasant woman or an American Indian, the child has been made aware of the world beyond his or her own borders. The fourth album of the series, also designed and illustrated by Parain, goes beyond mere paste and scissors. The Russian folk tale of Baba-Yaga transports the reader to another time and kingdom. This is the Russian counterpart of the French Puss-in-Boots. The child would obviously identify with the little peasant girl and the wise and clever cat. As can be seen from the cover of the Russian version published simultaneously by the YMCA Press, Parain emphasizes action by a skillful combination of simplified forms and well-selected colors (fig. 17). Throughout the book the stress is on movement, be it Baba-Yaga swishing through space in her mortar; brandishing her pestle and dragging her broom, or the young girl dashing through the woods. By 1933 Rojankovsky had joined the Pere Castor team, and both he and Guertik gave us a whole course in natural history, covering animals, birds, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Whether it be Rojankovsky's story of a hare (Froux le lievre) or a duck (Plouf, canard sauvage) or Guertik's coloring books of fruits and vege- tables (Desfruits; Des legumes), both are realists with a pronounced touch of poetry. Few artists did more to acquaint young readers with the natural world. If Rojankovsky and Guertik explore the natural world, Bilibin is wont to explore, once more, the realm of fairy tales and legends, Russian and foreign. His Tale of the Little Gold Fish (Conte du petitpoisson d'or) is a rendition of Pushkin's well-known Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish (Skazka o rybake i rybke) while his The Flying Carpet, the Ivory Tube, and the Magic Apple (Tapis volant, le tuyau d'ivoire, et lapomme magique) is an attractive rendition of a story from the Arabian Nights. The style remains that of the World of Art, a combination of gorgeous colors, sumptuous garments, and oriental locales. As can be seen from the covet; his style has not substantially evolved from that of earlier productions, as the stress remains on the exotic and decorative elements (fig. 18). If a break was to be made in format and style, Exter was to make it in the grand- est manner. Paul Fauchet; editor of the Pere Castor series, had the felicitous idea of inviting Extet; then living, like most Russian artists, in straitened circum- stances, to join his team of illustrators. Extet; whose multiple talents and wide culture allowed her to move with equal ease in stage design, easel painting, book illustration, and design of various art objects, produced in 1936 No. 56 of the series, My Garden (Monjardin), a book of cutouts. Her most striking contributions came in 1937 with No. 67, Panorama of the River (Panorama dufleuve) (fig. 19), followed in 1938 by Nos. 80 and 81, Panorama of the Coast (Panorama de la cote) and Panorama of the Mountain (Panorama de la montagne) (fig. 20), masterpieces of graphic design, unsur- passed to this day. Shortly before Extet; Alexandre Serebriakoff had given French children a poetic geography of France, Our France (Notre France), which showed on a number of folio-size pages the physical, commercial, and cultural development of the country. But Exter's approach was different. In 102 DAPA Winter 1989</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 17. Nathalie Parain, lithographed cover illustration for N.A.

This is stage design applied to geography. On the verso, the text by Marie Colmont, illustrated in black and white, comments on various activities connected with a given landscape. Because of the fragility of the format, and the care required to handle them properly, very few copies have survived. The American version, published by Harper in a standard book form, with execrable lithography, failed to command the success it deserves. If the Pere Castor series owes its initial brilliance to the talented team of Russian artists whom Faucher attracted to this enterprise, another series, smaller in number but of exceedingly high quality, forms the last link in the chain of Russian illustrators. In 1934, Gallimard published Marcel Ayme's Tales of the Perched Cat (Les contes du chatperche), illustrated by Natan Altman and lithographed by Mourlot. This was swiftly followed by two other contes, The Mean Goosey-Gander (Le mauvaisjars) and The Elephant (L'elephant), in 1935. This series of immensely witty tales, written in the best French tradition of taste and elegance, relates the hilarious adventures of two little farm girls and their animal friends. The cover of Les contes du chatperche (fig. 22), reminding us in a very subtle way of a May Day celebration, summarizes the adventures and personalities of the four sto- ries and captures their spirit. The grand prize should go to the illustrations for "Les boeufs," a merciless satire on pompous academic drones. Both Le mauvais jars and L'elphant continued the tradition in grand style. Parain, who took over the subsequent tales upon Altman's departure for the Soviet Union, did a most creditable job, but she never quite, as Altman had, captured the Gallic wit of the stories.

This falls right in line with his previous illustrations to Rene Maran's "colonial novel" Batouala and stresses local color; anatomical precision, and matchless draftsmanship. From Grigoriev's Children s Island (Detskii ostrov) toJacovleffs last work, Russian artists, each in his own way, gave European children some of the finest juveniles of the period, enriched their lives, and made a signal contribution to this art form. Their work remains an enduring testimony to unique originality, deserves recognition, and needs further study. o DAPA Winter 1989 105</page></plain_text>
