<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why Should I Mention Aiakos? Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 [Part I] Jeffrey S. Carnes Although much discussed , the relation between myth and politics in Nemean 8 has been largely misunderstood, owing both to an insuffi cient appreciation of the mythic background of the Aiginetan hero Aiakos and to flawed assumptions about the mechanics of political myth. In this paper I will examine in detail the Aiakos myths; propose a new model for the interpretation of these myths; and briefly suggest ways in which this new data and new model may affect our interpreta tion of Nemean 8 and the other Aiginetan odes. Aiakos and Aiginetan Autochthony It is hardly surprising that Aiakos, as the eponymous founder of the Aiakidai, figures prominently not only in Nem. 8 but in the Aiginetan odes as a whole, being referred to by name ten times in the eleven odes. Yet Aiakos remains "a rather shadowy figure at best"2: in contrast to the detailed accounts of the deeds of Achilles or the suffer ing of Aias, Aiakos is usually accorded only passing mention. Only in three odes (Isth. 8, 01. 8, and Nem. 8) does Pindar relate at any length myths concerning Aiakos3, and it is from these that we must garner an understanding of the associations which the name "Aiakos" conveyed 1 A. K?hnken, Die Funktion des Mythos bei Pindar, Berlin-New York 1971, 19-23 summarizes the major approaches to the question. 2 T.K. Hubbard, 'Two Notes on the Myth of Aeacus in Pindar', Gr. Rom. Byz. Stud. 28, 1987, 5-22 (here p. 7). 3 Hubbard provides the most thorough recent discussion of the myths in 01. 8 (Aiakos' assistance in the building of Troy's walls) and Isth. 8 (Aiakos' role in settling disputes among the gods). For the relevance of the latter to Nem. 8, see below, p. 24.</page><page sequence="2">8 J. S. Carnes to an Aiginetan audience. Nem. 8, in devoting most of its first triad to Aiakos, alludes to two of the most significant aspects of his mythology: his autochthony and his intercession with Zeus to end a Panhellenic drought. Aiakos emerges in Nem. 8 as an example of the results of the good sort of Eros guaranteed by Hora and kairos; it is his birth in v. 7 which provides the occasion for the praise of these entities in the opening lines. As a result of the union of Zeus and Aigina, eblasten d'huios Oinonas basileus cheiri kai boulais aristos. It is the word eblasten, with its strong vegetal metaphor, which introduces into the ode one of the most significant, and most neglected4, characteristics of Aiakos and the Aiginetans: their autochthony. The tradition of Aiginetan autochthony may be traced back as far as Hesiod (fr. 205 M.-W. ap. Schol. ad Nem. 3, 13), who reports the birth of Aiakos and his role in the creation of the Myrmidons from ants: f\ ?' vjTOXi)oauxvT| T8X8V Aiax?v Ljrmox?Quvryv... amag ejtei q' t$t|? jroXvrjQ?tov ?xeto fx?iQov, Hcr?vo? ? v fjoxaM.8* Jtatr|Q ?' ?v?fj v te dearv te, ?oooi ?oav iivqwke? ?m)Qaxov ?v?oik vrjoou, toij? ?v??a?

Aiakos and the Myrmidons are analogous to other spontaneously generated populations (Kadmos and the Spartoi; Deukalion and the stone-people; Kekrops and the Athenians)6: in each case the hero is 4 Most commentators on Nem. 8 (including Farnell, Bury, Fennell and Carey) fail to note the autochthony of Aiakos and the Aiginetans; although Wilamowitz (Home rische Untersuchungen, Berlin 1884, 245) recognizes the Myrmidons' autochthony, he fails to examine its possible significance in his comments on Nem. 8 in Pindaros, Berlin 1922, 406-411. 5 Nonnos (13,201 ff.) recounts the story in greater detail; Theogenes (FGrHist 300), Tzetzes (ad Lye. 176) and Strabo (8,375) all tell euhemerized versions; for the possible political motivation of these variants, see below p. 38 f. 6 For Kekrops see Philochoros (FGrHist 328 F 95); Deukalion: Apldr. 1,7,2; Pind. 01.9,41; Hyg. Fab. 153; Kadmos: Pherekydes, FGrHist 3 F 22a, b; Eur. Phoen. 939 ff.; Apldr. 3,4,1; Paus. 9,10,1; Schol. II. 2,494; Hyg. Fab. 178. The creation of humans from the earth, like many other aspects of autochthony (and of Greek myth in general) is paralleled in Near Eastern sources. In my discussion of the features of autochthony I will occasionally cite Biblical parallels to Greek myth;</page><page sequence="3">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 9 responsible for the creation of a people from the earth. Parts of the earth (mud, stones) or ground-dwelling creatures (ants, snakes) furnish the materials out of which the autochthonous race is created7. The authochthony of Aiakos himself is less immediately evident, since he is born from two parents, not from the earth itself, and since Pindar does not refer to him with the word autochthon or its near synonym gegenes. While it is true that Aiakos is in a certain, very literal sense not an autochthon, he exhibits many of the features of autochthony, serving as what we may call a "modified autochthon". A. Brelich (Gli eroi greci, Rome 1958, 138) classes Aiakos with other autochthonous city founders, whose autochthony "si esprime indiret tamente, per allusioni, per varianti equivalenti o sopravvive come trac cia di una concezione non pi? direttamente documentata"8. Brelich's assessment is not only true for the founders of cities: much of the auto chthony exhibited in Greek myth is modified in some form, for reasons having largely to do with autochthony's function and structure (see be low, p. 12 f.); this modification of "pure" autochthony has often kept scholars from recognizing its presence. Further, the absence of the word autochthon from Pindar is not in itself significant: its absence may be I do this on the assumption that such correspondences are not entirely fortuitous and are probably indicative of cross-cultural borrowing, and in the belief that these paral lels, being familiar to the reader, will make the overall pattern of Greek autochthony myth more readily comprehensible. The question of the relation between Greek and Near Eastern religion goes back at least as far as Herodotus, and I will not attempt a discussion of this complex and highly controversial issue. Extensive examinations of the problem may be found in R. Brown, Semitic Influence in Hellenic Myth, London 1898; and more recently J. Puhvel, Comparative Mythology, Baltimore 1987; M. Ber nai, Black Athena, New Brunswick 1988-91, vv. 1-2; and R. Mondi, 'Greek Mythic Thought in the Light of the Near East', in L. Edmunds, Approaches to Greek Myth, Baltimore 1990, 142-198. 7 The association of autochthons with snakes is common; this is the case for the Athenians Kekrops, Erichthonios and Erechtheus (for sources see K.R. Walters, 'Another Showdown at the Cleft Way', Class. World 77, 1984, 337-351 [here 340 n. 12; 344 n. 21]); for the Salaminian Kychreus see p. 13 below. The generation of auto chthons from stones is conditioned not only by their status as part of the earth, but by the resemblance between laos and laas (Pind. 01. 9,43-46; Philochoros, FGrHist 328 F 95; Apldr. 1,7,2). The autochthony of the Myrmidons was in some instances expli citly recognized: Harpocration (s.v. 'autochthones') includes the Aiginetans in his list (see n. 9 below), while Nonnos (13,201 ff.) refers to the Myrmidons as the aposporos hestnos aroures, possessing a chamaigenes eidos. 8 Brelich's examples of latent autochthons include Ogygos, Pelasgos, Aras, Eumelos and Erechtheus.</page><page sequence="4">10 J. S. Carnes explained in terms of historical development (autochthon and gegenes are first attested in Herodotus); stylistic considerations (the words may not have formed part of the epinician idiom); or the poet's relation to his audience (if the Aiginetans considered themselves autochthons, an ex plicit reference to the fact might have seemed otiose; we may note that the word Aiginetes also fails to appear in Pindar)9. Evidence for the autochthony of Aiakos may be found both within and without the text of Pindar. First, we may note Pindar's description of his birth in strongly vegetal terms at Nem. 8,7. The vegetal metaphor in blastano was very much a live one at the time: Pindar provides the first two examples of the verb applied metaphorically to something other than the growth of plants. His only other use of blastano is so strong a metaphor as to be almost literal: at 01. 7,69 the island of Rhodes (which is of course literally a rose, rhodos) blaste men ex halos hygras. Although the metaphorical sense of blastano later faded with use, turning the verb in some instances into a synonym for gignesthai, the verb and its compounds remained throughout antiquity a sort of technical term for the birth of autochthons (Erichthonios; the Spartoi; the children of Oedipus) and other earth-associated creatures (the giant Alkyoneus and various monsters) ?. Moreover, Pindar again uses veget 9 The problem of the autochthony of the Aiginetans in post-Pindaric sources is more vexing. The autochthony of the Aiginetans was recognized by Harpocration (s.v. 'autochthones') and his sources (possibly Hellanikos): autochthones de kai Arkades esan, hos Hellanikos phesi, kaiAiginetai kai Thebaioi. The sources here may be refer ring to the Myrmidons, not to Aiakos per se; post-Pindaric references to Aiakos down play his autochthony (indeed, his role becomes narrowed rather quickly to that of underworld judge; see n. 93 below). The loss of Aiginetan independence in 431 must have removed the impetus for the creation and preservation of native mythic traditions, and Aiginetan myth was particularly subject to Athenian co-optation (see below, p. 38 ff.). In particular, Aiginetan claims to autochthony may have run afoul of the Athe nians' tendentious claim to have been the only autochthons in Greece. Hellanikos, writing in the fifth century, would presumably have had access to mythic sources from independent Aigina; if he is in fact Harpocration's source, this may account for the latter's explicit recognition of Aiginetan autochthony. I will argue that Pindar's refer ence to Aiakos' autochthony is clear, and that the prominence of autochthony in Nem. 8 suggests that it may have played a part in the Aiginetans' self-representation before a Panhellenic audience. 10 Erichthonios: Eur. Ion. 267; the children of Oedipus: Soph. O.T. 1376; the Spartoi: Eur. Her. 4 and Lucian Philops. 3; Alkyoneus: PLG (4) III 713; various monsters: Plut. Mor. 991 A. Eur. Her. 178 refers to the Giants as blastemata ges. As noted above, Nonnos (13,201 ff.) uses the verb to refer to the birth of the Myrmidons.</page><page sequence="5">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 11 al terminology to describe the birth of Aiakos at Nem. 7,84: legonti gar Aiakon nin (sc. Zeus) hypo matrodokois gonais phyteusai. Like blastano (if to a lesser degree), phyteuo retains strong vegetal associations in Pindar (two of his four uses of the word for human birth refer to Aiakidai)11. Here Zeus plants Aiakos with mother-received seeds, col lapsing the distinction between the nymph Aigina and the soil of the island for which she is the eponym. Within this context, we must see Pindar's use of blastano in Nem. 8 as strongly marked and quite prob ably a reference to Aiakos' autochthony. In addition to these vegetal metaphors, there are a number of other ways in which Aiakos conforms to patterns typical of autochthons. First is the probable derivation of his name from aia, and the earth-related etymologies of the names of other members of his family (Endeis, Peleus, Aias)12. Second, Aiakos and his family exhibit many of the destructive traits (father-son conflict; fratricidal strife; failure of suc cession) characteristic of autochthony (see p. 13 and n. 18 below). Third, his mother Aigina, as noted above, is a personification of his native land; as a nymph, she belongs to the class of minor divinities (cf. Eris, Hypnos, Thanatos, Hora) who are not fully anthropomorphized, remaining closer in nature to pure abstractions13, facilitating the sort of de-anthropomorphizing practiced by Pindar in Nem. 7. Aiakos is in one 11 The metaphorical uses oiphyteuo develop as early as Homer (Od. 5,340); in Hesiod (Op. 812; Sc. 29) it is used to refer to non-autochthonous births. Of Pindar's twelve metaphorical uses of the verb, five are in Aiginetan odes, four in Pyth. 4; for the link between agriculture and sexuality in the latter ode, see C. Segal, Pindar s Myth making: the Fourth Pythian Ode, Princeton 1986, 69-71. 12 H. Frisk (Griechisches Etymologisches W?rterbuch, Heidelberg 1960-72) and P. Chantraine (Dictionnaire ?tymologique de la langue grecque, Paris 1968-80) both tentatively accept the connection between Aias and aia; the denominative suffix -ak(os) seems to be an example of the use E. Schwyzer calls "lediglich erweiternd" (Griechische Grammatik, Munich 1939, 496-497). Autochthons have a strong tenden cy to bear earth-related names: cf. Erechtheus, Erichthonios, Chthonios, Adam. 13 Although nymphs were, as Nilsson points out (Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, Munich 1967, 244-253) freely anthropomorphized as young women, they were also typically associated with a particular place; nymphs such as Salamis and Aigina, invented to personify their cities, could preserve the "Verbindung zwischen der Gottheit und dem Natursubstrat" which Nilsson observes for the river gods from whom they are descended (58-60). For the overall inconsistency of the anthropomorph ism of the Greek gods, see W. Burkert, Greek Religion, Cambridge Ma. 1985, 182 189.</page><page sequence="6">12 J. S. Carnes sense born from two parents, in another sense from the land itself; the myth, in its modification of autochthony, has it both ways. Aiakos is not unique in his status as modified autochthon. His situation is closely paralleled by that of the Salaminian autochthon Kychreus, who was born from the union of a god (Poseidon) and Sala mis, the island's eponymous nymph (and sister of Aigina)14. As Aiakos is associated with the ground-dwelling ants, Kychreus is closely associ ated with snakes, and is sometimes said to be half-human, half-snake (Lye. Alex. Ill; at Paus. 1,36,1 he is said to have appeared as a snake at the battle of Salamis). Perhaps the best-known example of modified autochthony is that of Erichthonios, whose birth is the result of Hephaistos' unsuccessful attempt to rape Athena15. Erichthonios liter ally grows out of the ground, yet is also in a certain sense the child of Hephaistos and Athena, embodying both the sexual and vegetal models of reproduction16. It is the very nature of autochthony which necessitates its mod ification. Autochthony is posited as a solution to the problem of the origin of the human race17: a way of explaining how the first humans 14 For the collocation of the Asopids from disparate local traditions, see M. L. West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, Oxford 1985, 162-164. 15 Apldr. 3,14,6. When Athene resisted Hephaistos' attempt to rape her, he ejaculated on her thigh; Athena wiped off the semen with a piece of wool, which she threw to the ground; from this Erichthonios was born. 16 See J. Peradotto, 'Oedipus and Erichthonius: Some Observations on Para digmatic and Syntagmatic Order', Arethusa 10, 1977, 85-101; here 92-95. Peradotto refers to the "false starts" of Attic autochthony - the series of kings unable to produce male heirs and ordered succession. As persuasive as I find Peradotto's analysis of the myth's structure, I think he overstates its success in mediating the contradictions of autochthony. The "progressive increase in reproductivity after Erichthonius" (italics in original) is illusory, the result of accepting the narrative's falsely imposed chronology. Peradotto claims that with Aigeus, "the problem of reproductivity re-asserts itself; rather, the problem is always there, and is only tentatively resolved in the birth of Erichthonios. 17 Greek creation myths are usually local, explaining the origin of a particular people, not humankind as a whole; this perhaps reflects the late development of "Greece" as a social and political concept. This does not substantially affect the mechanics of autochthony, since the myths uniformly depict a closed system in which there is (at first) no contact with the outside world. (The descendants of autochthons attempt to establish exchange, including marriage with other peoples, even in cases, such as the marriage of Cain, where the existence of other peoples is logically pre cluded).</page><page sequence="7">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 13 came into being without having parents to produce them sexually. Yet autochthony presents only a partial solution: although it accounts for the origin of a people, it founders on the problem of the transition from vegetal to sexual reproduction. Autochthons typically experience infer tility (Laios), inability to produce male heirs (Kychreus; the Athenians Aktaios and Kekrops), and difficulty in securing peaceful and ordered succession (Oedipus; Aiakos; the Athenians Kranaos, Amphiktyon and Erichthonios; Adam). Fratricidal strife (the Spartoi; Eteocles and Polyneikes; Peleus, Telam?n and Phokos; Abel and Cain) and father son conflict (Laios/Oedipus; Oedipus/Eteocles and Polyneices; Aiakos/ Peleus and Telam?n) are common. Autochthony essentially and fun damentally denies sexual reproduction, and produces a closed, anti social system in which intra-familial conflict is inevitable18. Modified autochthony attempts to find a way out of the dilemma, although the persistence of the myths' underlying contradictions cir cumscribes the success of the attempt. A demonstration of the persist ence of such contradictions may be found in the creation of large auto chthonous populations such as the Myrmidons and Spartoi. This looks like an adequate response to the incest problem (the children of auto 18 The problem may best be expressed in structural terms: autochthony seeks to resolve a contradiction (the need to posit an origin for the human race or a particular people vs. the impossibility of infinitely regressing sexual reproduction), but having achieved this mediation is itself opposed to a contradictory term (sexual reproduction). Here we must carefully distinguish between the surface and "deep" levels of the myths: on the surface autochthony per se appears an unmixed blessing, guaranteeing the legitimacy and the righteousness of the peoples who claim it. On the deep level, however, the inherently anti-sexual nature of autochthony engenders problems of fer tility and succession, which appear on the narrative level as its unwanted by-products. Attempts to ameliorate these problems on the narrative level, since they fail to resolve the underlying conflict between autochthony and sexual reproduction, achieve only tentative and partial successes. (Attempts to replace the sexual/vegetal contradiction with another, such as over/undervaluation of kinship, or blood relation/contiguity, may be more fruitful). Autochthons and their children typically inhabit closed societies which have ex treme difficulty establishing exchange (including marriage exchange) with the outside world. In such societies competition among males typically becomes deadly (Freud's theory of the primal horde and totemic father murder has some validity here, although it must be emphasized that autochthony does not represent any real stage in human evolution; rather, its imaginary phylogeny reflects the real ontogeny of human psycho logical development). For a discussion of the psycho-analytic implications of auto chthony, see my 'The Ends of the Earth: Fathers, Ephebes and Wild Women in Ne mean 4 and 5', Arethusa 29, 1996.</page><page sequence="8">14 J. S. Carnes chthons must mate with one another), yet is a singular failure. The tendency of autochthons toward fratricidal strife manifests itself (the newly-created autochthons may immediately set about killing one another); moreover, the anti-sexual (and anti-female) nature of auto chthony typically results in the production of all-male populations19. Even where a plausible solution is found (as in the case of the Spartoi of Cadmus, five of whom survive to become the ancestors of the Theban nobility), the myths of subsequent generations (Laios; Oedipus; Eteo cles and Polyneices) bear witness to the persistence of the conflict. The myths become a sort of aporetic dialogue, in which new solutions to the underlying problems are constantly proposed, provisionally accepted, and ultimately found wanting20. It is within this context that we must view the attempt to modify the autochthony of Aiakos. It is at least partially successful ? Pindar and others are able to suggest that he is born both sexually and vegetally, thus allowing the Aiginetans to claim the privileges of both autochthony and descent from Zeus. Yet the failure of Aiginetan autochthony in a larger context is represented by Aiakos' conflict with his sons (his per petual banishment of them from Aigina), their fratricidal strife (the kill ing of Phokos by Peleus and Telam?n), and the failure of Aiakos (de spite having three sons and a host of Myrmidons) to find a successor (cf. Paus. 2,29,2: basileusanta de en tei gei p?en Aiakon oudena eipein echousin, epei mede ton Aiakou paidon tina ismen katameinanta). The lack of succession in the Aiakid line raised problems for the Aiginetans' conception of themselves as Aiakidai, and required media tion with their Dorian heritage; there are only the barest hints as to the form this mediation may have taken21. 19 Although Hesiod (fr. 205 M.-W.) refers to the creation of bathyzonous gynaikas among the Myrmidons, this is atypical. 20 The appreciation of the dynamic nature of myth, which attempts to account for myth's numerous and contradictory variants, is perhaps Structuralism's most signifi cant contribution. An apparently meandering and pointless narrative, such as the long list of the autochthonous kings of Attica, is comprehensible when seen as an attempt to mediate an unresolvable contradiction in the Weltanschauung of its creators. 21 The exile of Peleus and Telam?n for the killing of their half-brother Phokos left Aiakos without an heir; on the evidence of Nem. 5 we may conclude that the Aiginetans did not view this as a source of shame, but rather as a chance to export their glory to other lands. It was, in reality, a chance to appropriate other peoples' myths; see n. 97 below.</page><page sequence="9">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 15 Pindar's depiction of Aiakos in Nem. 8 reflects his status as mod ified autochthon through the conflation of sexual and vegetal models for his birth. Far from glossing over the potential conflict between the two models, Pindar has set them in high relief. Sexuality dominates the first six-and-a-half lines of the ode: Hora, the karyx Aphroditas, introduces the theme of sexual love; Zeus and Aigina are examples of areionon eroton, and are attended by the poimenes... Kyprias down; as a result of all this sexuality Aiakos shoots forth like a plant. The final words of this dense erotic metaphor (Kyprias down) are followed immediately by eblasten: Pindar could hardly have made the contrast, and the apparent paradox, any stronger. Contributing to the conflation of the sexual and the vegetal is the syntactic ambiguity of what follows22. The words huios Oinonas basileus, serving as the postponed subject of eblasten, are like a mathe matical expression in want of parentheses: upon which nominative does Oinonas depend? Most modern commentators and translators either make no comment, or make Oinonas dependent on basileus23. Yet the scholia read "son of Oinona", which, with basileus in apposition, pre sents no syntactic difficulty. Semantics are another matter. If we fail to Pindar freely juxtaposes the Aiakid and Dorian aspects of the Aiginetans' herit age; of particular interest is 01. 8,30, where Aigina is referred to as a land Doriei laoi tamieuomenan ex Aiakou. The tamias metaphor (which, as L. Kurke points out [The Measures of Praise, Ithaca 1991, 37-83] is commonly used by Pindar with reference to the management of kleos) may give us a hint of the Aiginetans' ways of resolving the discrepancies in their lineage. The conflict between Aiakid and Dorian heritage parallels that between auto chthony and Ionian kinship in Athens. The intricate solution for the latter problem posed by Euripides' Ion is the most detailed surviving example of the modification of autochthony. See also n. 74 below. 22 In speaking of ambiguity, I mean to imply not that Pindar's meaning is merely unclear, but that there is a deliberate attempt by the poet to convey more than one message (and that his audience would be sensitive to such an attempt). The ambiguity found in v. 7 would be classified by Aristotle as one of diairesis or division (Poetics 1461a 23-25), and fits into Empson's classification as an example of the fourth type, in which "two or more meanings of a statement do not agree among themselves, but combine to make clear a more complicated state of mind in the author" (W. Empson, Seven Types of Ambiguity, London 1949, 133). 23 Bury in his commentary translates "king of Oinona"; similarly Nisetich, Con way and Bowra in their translations. Finley (154) is an exception in translating "Oino na's son grew up a king", while Lattimore ("And there grew a son and king of Oinona") perhaps takes it both ways.</page><page sequence="10">16 J. S. Carnes recognize the conflation of vegetal and sexual in the passage, the phrase "son of Oinona" becomes paradoxical if taken literally, yet diffi cult to take metaphorically24; it is not surprising that this reading has been rejected (or overlooked) by most commentators. Yet given the modified autochthony of Aiakos, huios Oinonas may have a literal force, with Aiakos arising literally out of the soil of the island (as at Nem. 7,84). Moreover, the ambiguity unfolds diachronically for the listener (and, to a lesser extent, for the reader): huios is followed by the apparently dependent genitive Oinonas; even if the listener/reader ulti mately decides in favor of "king of Oinona", the possibility "son of Oinona" presents itself first. Syntactic ambiguity mirrors the paradoxic al nature of modified autochthony: just as the myth seeks to suggest that contradictory possibilities may be simultaneously entertained, so too does the syntax suggest more than it can logically deliver. At the risk of adding further confusion to a passage which had heretofore seemed clear, I propose that the recognition of Aiakos' auto chthony suggests a new possibility for the interpretation of the entire phrase basileus cheiri kai boulais aristos. This is at first glance conven tional praise, casting Aiakos in the mold of the ideal Homeric hero, excelling in both strength and wisdom25. There is of course an apparent chronological inconsistency between the moment of his birth (empha sized by the aspect of the aorist eblasten) and his kingship and excell ence (which are grammatically predicated on the verb). Translators and commentators (to the extent that they have thought about it) have under stood basileus... aristos proleptically: Aiakos the (future) king. There is no syntactic or conceptual difficulty in this. Yet we must bear in mind that one of the traits commonly ascribed to autochthons is their lack of a childhood: they spring forth fully formed, often ready to do battle26. 24 Pindar speaks of someone as the metaphorical son of his native land only at 01. 9,14, where the victor is described as the son of the city of Opous. The metaphor is, as far as I can tell, not found in earlier Greek. 25 The Scholia ad loc. cite //. 3,179, in which Agamemnon is described as amphoteron basileus t'agathos krateros t'aichmetes. Expressing the same dichotomy is //. 18, 105-106 (Achilles describing himself): toios eon hoios ou tisAchaion chalkochi tonon I en polemoi: agorei de t'ameinones eisi kai alloi. 26 This is most obviously the case for the Spartoi and other large autochthonous populations. Hesiod's tous andras poiese bathyzonous te gynaikas suggests that this is true for the Myrmidons; more explicit is Nonnos 13,201: stratos eblasten enoplios. Among individual autochthons, there is a great deal of variation, and a pronounced tendency in narrative versions to assimilate autochthons to more normal patterns of</page><page sequence="11">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 17 Given the density of references to autochthony, the aspect of eblasten, and the emphatic position of basileus, it is possible that Pindar implies that Aiakos was himself a fully-formed basileus aristos at the moment of his birth. Such an allusion, if present, would increase the glory of Aiakos by bringing him into the company of those heroes, such as Achilles and Herakles, whose precocity is recounted elsewhere by Pin dar (Nem. 3,43 ff. and Nem. 1,37 ff. ; cf. also the precocity of Athena and Hermes). The possibility of such interpretation depends on the mythic traditions of the Aiginetans: if local legend held that Aiakos sprang forth fully formed, Pindar's words would naturally be taken to indicate this, while the modern reader (and perhaps even the non Aiginetan ancient reader), without knowledge of such traditions, will take basileus... aristos proleptically. The question is of course ultimate ly unresolvable; yet it may make us aware of the possibilities for ex tremely subtle coding on Pindar's part, and enable us to realize how much of the odes' mythic background is hidden from the modern reader27. The Embassy to Aiakos The ode continues directly from the autochthony and excellence of Aiakos to the following: noXXa viv jtoX, Xoi Xitaveuov l?e?v a?oati y?g f|Q?xov acotoi JteQivatexa?vxcov 10 f?fteXov xe?vou ye Jte?freo?r' ?va^iai? ?xoviE?, development. Thus Hesiod feels the need to motivate Aiakos' request for the creation of the Myrmidons: autar epei r hebes polyeratou hiketo metron, I mounos eon eschalle. Like most attributions of motivation to mythic characters, this is an ad hoc explanation of an apparent inconsistency for the sake of narrative coherence. Such explanations are extraneous to the myth: since characters in myth have no real motivations, to provide them is to engage in mimetic fallacy. These attempts at grafting rationality onto myth are often transparently weak and irrational; e.g., wasn't Aiakos lonely be . fore reaching manhood? 27 Hesiod, while providing limited evidence against the existence of such a tradi tion for Aiakos, should not be taken as definitive for fifth-century Aigina. For the possibility of now-lost Aiginetan traditions, see p. 24 f. below; for Pindar's inclusion of both exoteric and esoteric elements in the odes, and his capacity for extremely subtle allusion to his patrons' myths, see nn. 56 and 60 below.</page><page sequence="12">18 J.

The Scholiast (ad Nem. 8,19a, p. 142 Drachmann) is the first known critic to connect this passage with the Embassy to Aiakos, one of the most widespread Aiginetan myths28. The main details of the embas sy myth are the same in all sources: with a drought afflicting all of Greece, Aiakos is asked by the leaders of the other Greek cities to intercede with his father Zeus, who grants Aiakos' prayer for rain29. The embassy also provided an etiology for the founding of the cult of Zeus Hellenios, the most internationally renowned of Aiginetan shrines30, and was depicted by the Aiginetans on the Aiakeion (Paus. 2,29,6-8). It is by no means certain that this is the myth to which Pindar refers. It is of course in the Pindaric manner to allude rather than to 28 The major sources: Isoc. 9,14-15; Paus. 2,29,6-8; Apldr. 3,12,6; Diod. Sic. 4,60-61; Scholia ad Pind. Nem. 5,17a. Wilamowitz (Pindaros 406), L. Farnell (Critical Commentary to the Works of Pindar II, London 1932, 304-305) and C. Carey (Proc. Cambridge Philol. Soc. 202, 1976, 29) follow the Scholia in relating the passage to the embassy myth; most other commentators do not deal with the question. 29 Autochthony myths frequently involve crop failures, plagues and the like; cf. Oedipus, Laomedon, and Telam?n. Aiakos is unusual in that he is responsible for solving the problem, rather than creating it. This may be due to the idealized father son relations presented in these myths: rather than engaging in the sort of rebellion against the father which leads to infertility, Aiakos displays filial piety, which cures it. 30 The etiology is explicit in Isocrates and the Scholia, implicit in Pausanias; absent from Apollodorus and Diodorus. The Aiginetan cult is referred to at Nem. 5,17, where the prayer of Aiakos and his sons to Zeus Hellanios guarantees the island's future renown; at Pai. 6,125 Pindar calls Aigina the Dios Hellaniou phaennon astron. Hellenios as a cult title is found as well in Syracuse, Tenos and Sparta, but the Aiginetan shrine was the most important. The name may reflect an origin for the cult in Thessalian Hellas: in addition to the Myrmidons' well-known association with the region, Aiakos is also linked to Thessaly; see n. 93 below. The importance of the fifth-century cult may be seen from Hdt. 9,7, where the Athenians reject the Persian offer of peace Dia te Hellenion aidesthentes kai ten Hella da. In addition, Ar. Eq. 1253 hails the defeat of the Paphlagonian with the words Hellanie Zeu, son to niketerion; by the late fifth century the cult had become Panhelle nic in practice if not in name. That the cult was renamed Panellenios is attested by Pausanias (loc. cit.), as well as CIG 2138b, a first century BC dedicatory inscription from Aigina.</page><page sequence="13">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 19 state (we may note that Aiakos, the subject of discussion since v. 6, has not yet been mentioned by name), so the absence of a more direct statement of the myth is not a significant argument against its identi fication here. There are, however, a number of ways in which Pindar's narrative does not mesh with the embassy myth, making the identifica tion of the myths problematic. The potential points of disagreement are as follows: 1. The aspect of the imperfect litaneuon may imply that the heroes begged to see Aiakos on more that one occasion; this is certainly the case if we follow Slater in translating polla as "often". 2. The verb idein emphasizes the process of being admitted as suppliants of Aiakos; it is not the equivalent of "ask to intercede". Moreover, the emphasis on the process of gaining an audience with Aiakos could, in the context of the embassy myth, imply a reluctance on his part to help the other states, which would seem in conflict with his reputation for piety (p. 28 below). In a non-embassy context the words might be indicative of the extent of his power and the heroes' extraordinary willingness to obey him (a point strongly emphasized in the pleonastic ethelon... hekontes of v. 10). 3. The other Greeks are willing to obey the anaxiai of Aiakos; yet no version of the embassy myth refers to any injunction of Aiakos upon his suppliants. Further, the extreme willingness of the heroes may be seen as not entirely consonant with the sort of necessity imposed by drought and famine. If we understand aboati (hapax for extant Greek) as "unbidden", Pindar's story is in direct conflict with the embassy myth, which in most versions depicts the heroes supplicating Aiakos at the behest of an oracle. The first point is fairly easily dismissed, since it is not certain that litaneuon refers to repeated action, nor need polla necessarily mean "often". For the former, we may note that a number of verba dicendi are regularly found in the imperfect "wo modernes Sprachgef?hl den Aorist erwarten w?rde" (Schwyzer II 277)31. As for the adverb, polla may mean "much" rather than "often" in Pindar (01. 2,8); in addition, the former meaning is especially common in Homer, as LSJ points out, with "earnest commands or entreaties" expressed by verbs such as lissomai 31 The imperfect might also be viewed as conative (Schwyzer II 278), although it seems unlikely, embassy myth or no, that Pindar wishes to imply that the entreaties of the heroes were unsuccessful.</page><page sequence="14">20 J. S. Carnes and keleuo?2. The embassy myth cannot be excluded on the basis of polla litaneuon alone. Yet the reading of polla as "much", necessary to save the literal identification with the embassy myth, only exacerbates problem two in its emphasis on the urgency and perhaps difficulty of the request. While the reference to Sparta and Athens as the aotoi of the neighbor ing heroes may be read as a condensation and re-emphasis of the Panhellenic embassy, it is hard to see litaneuon idein and peithestK anaxiais in such terms. We cannot accept the literal identification of Nem. 8, 11-13 with the embassy myth as we have it. While Pindar may have based his account on an entirely distinct (and otherwise unknown) myth, the embassy myth is not easily dismis sed. The centrality of the embassy myth to Aiginetan religion and cul ture is evident from its connection with the shrine of Zeus Hellenios and from its portrayal on the Aiakeion, increasing the chances that an Aiginetan audience would identify it from even indirect and imprecise allusions. Moreover, it is at least possible, depending on how literally we take Pindar's description of himself as a hiketas Aiakou semnon gonaton, that the presence of chorus and audience in front of the Aiakeion placed the embassy myth before their very eyes33. Most im portant, we may note that Pindar's narrative, although not exactly con gruent with the embassy myth on a literal level, has important thematic correspondences with not only this myth but with most other extant Aiakos myths. Nem. 8 forms part of a unified picture of Aiakos, in which he is renowned for piety and morality, and in which he frequently acts as judge or arbiter. The piety of Aiakos is attested explicitly in Plutarch (at Thes. 10 32 The closest parallel in Pindar, polla... litaneuen at Nem. 5,31b-32 (Hippo lyte's attempt to seduce Peleus) should perhaps be translated "begged much" (contra Slater, s.v. 'polla'): Peleus' reply (euthys apananato) seems to refer to a one-time rejection of Hippolyte's offer. The tense of litaneuen here might reflect its status as a verbum dicendi, or could be conative, given Pindar's emphasis on the failure of the request. Polla with verbs of entreaty in Homer: //. 5,358; 5,528; 9,183; 11,782. 33 We must note, however, that the words hiketas Aiakou make perfect sense without any literal reference to Aiginetan topography. Pindar, as often, identifies with the subjects of his poetry: with the heroes of old, and also with the present-day Aiginetan citizens, in their honoring of Aiakos. (This need not, however, support literal identification with the embassy myth, since the heroes are in the position of suppliants to Aiakos regardless of the exact reason for their submission).</page><page sequence="15">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 21 he is called the hosiotaton Hellenon) and Isocrates (9,14; Aiakos' eusebeia is given as the reason for the embassy). His piety is also impli cit in the embassy myth: he is in a position of moral and religious superiority to those who come asking for his aid, and is able to free them from the ill effects of their crimes34. Although Pindar does not specifically refer to Aiakos' piety, he has emphasized his connection to the gods, and in line 13 he receives the epithet semnos. Moreover, the extraordinary emphasis on the heroes' willingness to obey Aiakos (aboati, ethelon and hekontes within the space of two lines) enhances his moral stature in showing that he has not obtained his position by force35. Second, Pindar's portrayal of Aiakos is in close agreement with the numerous myths in which Aiakos serves as a judge or arbiter. The best-known of these is his role as judge of the dead, first found in Aristophanes, later becoming far and away the most popular Aiakos myth36. He is said to have settled a dispute over Megara (Paus. 1,39,6), and to have acted as judge over his sons' attempt to return from exile, forcing them to plead their case from an offshore reef (Paus. 2,29,10). Pindar himself acknowledges the tradition of Aiakos as judge: at Isth. 8,26-27 he says of Aiakos that ho kai daimonessi dikas epeiraine. Although the referent is uncertain37, kai daimonessi, "even 34 The drought is said by Diodorus and Apollodorus to have resulted from murder (on the possible political implications of this, see n. 110 below). "Natural" disasters in myth are typically the result of pollution; note also that in two of our sources the decision to seek out Aiakos is the result of an oracle's command, the result of his reputation for eusebeia in a third. Aiakos in his reception of the embassy corresponds typologically to a king granting fugitives purification for their crimes. 35 The word stratos may add to the anti-military emphasis of the passage. Although it often means "people" in Pindar (and may here be an anachronistic refer ence to Athenian democracy; see n. 114 below), it may also mean "army" (13 exam ples in Slater). Either meaning is equally plausible with harmozo (used here for the first time in this metaphorical sense). 36 Main sources: Ar. Ran. 465 ff. (actually a parody in which Aiakos is a gate keeper and slave); Plato, Apol. 41A, Gorg. 523E; Apldr. 3,12,6; Isoc. 9,15; Demosth. De corona 127; CIG III 6298; Pap. Gr. Mag. IV 1467. Boardman's article in LIMC lists six surviving pictorial representations of Aiakos; five of these show him as an underworld judge. On the possible reasons for this narrowing of Aiakos' role, see n. 93 below. 37 See Hubbard 6-16. The phrase dikas epeiraine is unparalleled, but admits of no plausible interpretation other than "brought disputes to an end". I agree with Hub</page><page sequence="16">22 J. S. Carnes for the gods" implies a fortiori that Aiakos had acted as a judge for mortals as well. Although Pindar does not explicitly refer to Aiakos as a judge in Nem. 8, his portrayal of Aiakos as a king exercising command over those who have willingly submitted to him is typical of archaic views of kingship, where judgment is an essential, even the quintessential, function of a king38. The connection is particularly strong in Hesiod, where kingship is linked withothe administration of justice in each of the four passages in which it is discussed39. There are, in fact, a num ber of close correspondences between Hesiod's depiction of judgment and Pindar's. In particular, at Theogony 84-87 the catalog of the Muses is followed by a description of the benefits they confer upon the kings they favor: tou d'epe'ek stomatos rei meilicha; hoi de te laoi I pantes es auton horosi diakrinonta themistas I itheieisi dikeisin; ho d'asphaleos agoreuon I aipsa te kai mega neikos epistamenos katepausen. In both Pindar and Hesiod there is an emphasis on seeing or looking toward the king40; the wisdom of the king in Hesiod (asphaleos; epistamenos) cor bard's conclusion (although for reasons somewhat different than his) that this refers to Aiakos' procread ve role in settling the dispute of Zeus and Poseidon over Thetis. 38 For kings and the administration of justice in the Iliad, see H. Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus, Berkeley 1971, 6-7. 39 Omitting the numerous uses of basileus to refer to specific individual kings, the word is found at Theog. 80 ff. (four times; see below); 434 (Hekate sits next to kings en tei dikei); Op. 38-39 (Perses is accused of bribing the basileas dorophagous, hoi tende diken ethelousi dikasai); and 202 ff. (four times; the hawk and nightingale, with accompanying illustrations of the effects of justice). 40 Od. 7,71-74 also makes the connection between people looking toward a ruler (here with admiration; the ruler is Arete) and the ruler's role as arbiter: hoi (sc. laoi) min ra theon hos eisoroontes I deidechatai mythoisin, hote steicheis' ana asty. I ou men gar ti noou ge kai aute deuetai esthlou, I hoisin feu phroneeisi kai andrasi neikea lyei. The parallels in Hesiod and Homer suggest that we should be aware of the literal physical sense of idein in Nem. 8: the heroes are begging to behold Aiakos (with wonder), rather than (or as well as) begging to see (i.e., have an audience with) him. The urgency of the heroes, potentially troublesome if the passage is literally equated with the embassy myth, here presents no problem - it is not a matter of Aiakos' reluctance to accede to their request, but rather his skill and reliability as an arbiter placing him in high demand. There are a number of additional parallels between Nem. 8 and the Hesiodic passages concerning justice. Each illustrates the effects of both good and bad judg ment (Hes. Op. 212-273; Nem. 8,22-34 on the judgment against Aias); each connects justice and the proper use of poetry (Theog. 80-93; Pindar's implicit contrast between himself and the bad judges and poets responsible for Aias' death; cf. Nem. 7,20-24);</page><page sequence="17">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 23 responds to Pindar's boulais aristos. The anaxiai which the heroes obey may in this context be rulings or decisions concerning disputes41. Also contributing to our impression of Aiakos as judge is the cen tral role which judgment plays in the ode as a whole: Pindar moves from Aiakos to Aias and the effects of false judgment, observing along the way the need to find a b?sanos for his own song (v. 20). As a judge/king Aiakos fulfills his genealogical destiny, taking over the role universally ascribed to his father Zeus (in addition to the usual aristocratic belief in the importance of heredity, Pindar has emphasized in vv. 5-7 that the birth of Aiakos is the result of ton areionon eroton). This picture of Aiakos ? autochthonous scion of Zeus, morally superior king and judge over the rest of Greece - held great potential as political propaganda (see below, pp. 38 f. and 45 f.). I think it likely that there existed on Aigina during Pindar's time a myth (or group of myths) which, while bearing some relation to the embassy myth, differed in showing Aiakos in the position of judge over all of Greece, possibly expanding this from one to a series of occasions42. It is of course easy to posit lost sources for what must remain otherwise unexplained. Yet later references to Aiakos are in general agreement with Pindar without being derivative of him, sug gesting that both make use of common sources. Such sources must have included a large amount of native Aiginetan material43. each speaks of the healing power of song (Op. 96-103; Nem. 8,48-51). Finally, the connection between justice and fertility, explicit in Hesiod (Op. 225-247; see also the Golden Age at Op. 108-126) is implicit in Nem. 8 (see Part II of this article, forthcom ing in this review). Pindar may be borrowing from Hesiod directly, or each may be drawing upon typical archaic beliefs. 41 Anaxiais is Beck's emendation for the codices' an axiais. Anoxia is elsewhere attested only in Hesychius, who claims that Aeschylus uses the word to mean basileia. This meaning is possible here, although immigration of heroes from other states does not accord with Aiakid tradition as well as does the portrayal of Aiakos as a judge. 42 It is not of course necessary that the embassy myth be the original of which the other is a variant: there is no structural basis for deciding such questions, and clues to chronological development (which can be misleading anyway) are entirely lacking. It would not be surprising if the embassy myth, with its more circumscribed assertion of Aiginetan superiority and its connection to an important Panhellenic cult, better sur vived the Aiginetans' loss of autonomy. 43 Many of the surviving myths about the Aiakidai are transparently pro Aiginetan in political outlook, and thus likely to be ultimately derived from Aiginetan sources. This is particularly true of the Aiginetans' adoption of Telam?n. See my The</page><page sequence="18">24 J. S. Carnes Hubbard, ? propos o? 01. 8 and Isth. 8, argues strenuously against the existence of otherwise unknown Aiginetan myths. Yet 01. 8 itself provides an example of a myth (Aiakos' participation in the building of Troy) which has survived only in Pindar and sources directly derived from him44. If there were myths that survived in only one source, should we not expect some myths not to have survived at all? The cor pus of Aiginetan myth is small, increasing the chance for unique variants and non-survivals; unlike Athenian myth, Aiginetan myth re ceives little corroboration from historical sources such as Diodorus Siculus and the fragments of the Atthidographers. Moreover, Aigina's loss of independence in 431 would have reduced not only the impetus for the creation and retelling of myths, but also the opportunity to prom ulgate Aiakid myths in the face of Athenian opposition45. It is of course possible that the myth of Nem. 8 is a Pindaric invention or his own adaptation of the embassy myth. Carey notes that "Aeacus' only act of Panhellenic authority, the prayer to Zeus during the drought, is here magnified, with careful loss of focus, to a virtual elective monarchy over the whole of Hellas" (italics in original)46. A plausible formulation, especially in light of the complex ambiguities of Uses of Aiakos: Pindar and the Aiginetan Imaginary, Lanham 1996, chapter 2 (forth coming). 44 Hubbard accepts the assertion of Didymus (quoted in the Scholia ad loc.) that this myth is an invention of Pindar. Despite Didymus' general reliability, he lived some four hundred years after Pindar, and could not, as Hubbard claims, have "had available to him virtually the entire corpus of Greek literature written both before and after Pindar" (19). Considering the perishability of papyrus and the limited scale of the ancient book trade, many less popular works must have been lost before they could be collected by Alexandrian scholars. Compare the case of modern film preservation: despite the ability of films to be reproduced and distributed with relative ease, the vast majority, perhaps 90%, of American silent films have been lost over the course of the last 60-80 years. When we consider as well the probably limited scope of the fifth century book trade (see W. Harris, Ancient Literacy, Cambridge Ma. 1989, 84-87) and the extreme perishability of oral tradition in the face of the Aiginetans' dispersal in 431, it seems highly unlikely that all, or even most, Aiginetan tradition made its way into the safe harbor of Alexandria. Another unique survival within the small corpus on Aiakos is his role in settling a dispute over Megara (Paus. 1,39,6). (Isth. 8,26-27 may provide another such example; see n. 37 above). 45 For evidence of the Athenians' attempt to co-opt Aiginetan myth, see below, p. 39 and nn. 93 and 113. 46 Carey 26-41 (here p. 29).</page><page sequence="19">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 25 vv. 6-7, but any loss of focus is likely to be from our perspective, not the Aiginetans'47. Estimations of the likelihood of Pindaric innovation have traditionally been inflated by a number of erroneous assumptions about the nature of myth and epinician. First is the underestimation of the number and variety of myths in circulation, a problem arising from our ignorance of the local traditions of Pindar's patrons and compound ed by the tendency to privilege the most attractive literary versions of a myth and to ignore or denigrate others as deviations from the "true" myth. The fact that Pindar is the earliest extant source for a myth can not be taken as proof that he has invented it48. The second problem is a certain Romantic conception of the poet's role; since various modern poetics place great emphasis on originality and innovation in both form and content, there is a tendency to ascribe the same aesthetic to poets of earlier times49. Archaic poetry, written in a culture with massive oral residue, often values tradition at the expense of innovation; this is par ticularly true in its treatment of myth, which has normative and para digmatic value for its audience. In addition, the ritual nature of the epinician exerts a conservative force50. Third, pre-Bundian notions of the relations of poet and audience lead to overstatements of the poet's willingness to include what is purely personal. Extensive inventions of myth are of a piece with other types of Pindaric irrelevance and should be admitted only as a last resort, not assumed a priori^1. Pindar wrote to praise and to please his patrons, and won their approval and ensured their continued patronage by writing in a manner consistent with their 47 We must distinguish between the ambiguities of vv. 6-7, where Pindar is trying to mediate irreconcilable opposites, and the obscurity of 9-13, caused by our lack of understanding of the myth's background. Aiakos as king/judge/arbiter is not incompatible with his role as the savior of Greece from the drought; rather it is an extension of that role in degree and possibly in time. 48 The myth of Pelops in 01. 1, long cited as an example of Pindaric invention, has recently been shown by G. Nagy (Pindar s Homer, Baltimore 1990, 116-135) to be a combination of two previously existing versions of the tale. 49 Witness the resistance to theories of oral poetry, which require the subversion of the highly literate poetics of the modern world. 50 On the ritual nature of the games and of praise poetry, see Nagy 116-145. 51 The longstanding view that neara exeuronta (v. 20) refers to a new version of the death of Aias has been successfully attacked (although on differing grounds) by Bundy (Studia Pindarica I, Berkeley 1962, 40), K?hnken (Die Funktion 30-33) and A. Miller ('Phthonos and Parphasis: The Argument of Nemean 8,19-34', Gr. Rom. Byz. Stud. 23, 1982, 111-120; here 111-115).</page><page sequence="20">26 J. S. Carnes view of themselves. As is clear from our examination of the autochthony of Aiakos, Pindar exhibits great familiarity with Aiginetan traditions, and a willingness to allude to those traditions in complex and subtle ways (see n. 60 below). Finally, we may note that the obvious political utility of the modified embassy myth also argues for Aiginetan rather than Pindaric invention, since the Aiginetans had a greater interest in promoting their political ends than did Pindar. Political Implications of the Myths Scholars who have examined the possible political implications of Nemean 8 fall into two camps: those who assert that the ode is political, and refers to specific, known, historical events; and those who deny the text any political reference. Among the former are Wilamowitz, Far nell, Finley, Bowra and Brown52; K?hnken and Carey, the most impor tant of the recent commentators on this ode, lead the latter faction. K?hnken attacks the historicists' views on the grounds that "Bevor man Ereignisse, die ganz au?erhalb des Gedichtes liegen, zu seiner Erkl?r ung benutzt, m??te zun?chst untersucht werden ob nicht der Mythos im Gedicht selbst eine Funktion hat, die alle von au?en herangetragenen historisierenden Deutungsversuche ?berfl?ssig macht (22-3)". The bulk of his chapter on Nem. 8 is devoted to explicating the function of the myths within the ode; his conclusions are accepted wholeheartedly by Carey53. Yet while K?hnken's arguments are a salutary corrective to other scholars' facile historical speculations, there is no need to deny entirely the possibility of political allusion within the ode. K?hnken and Carey rightly follow Bundy in showing that the ode is internally consistent and that its mythoi may be understood within the epinician program of praise for the victor; but Bundy himself did not deny the 52 Wilamowitz, Pindaros 406-411; Farneil 303-309; N.O. Brown, 'Pindar, Sophocles and the Thirty Years' Peace', Trans. Am. Philol. Ass. 82, 1951, 1-28; J. Finley, Pindar and Aeschylus, Cambridge Ma. 1955, 150-156; CM. Bowra, Pindar, Oxford 1964, 298-299; W. Mullen, 'Pindar and Athens', Arion n.s. 1, 1973, 446-495. Most of their efforts are directed at interpreting the references to Aias; for their inter pretation of the embassy myth, see n. 116 below. The significance of autochthony in Nem. 8 goes unrecognized. 53 "(T)o read history into these verses is to sever the continuity of the passage and destroy the tenor of the ode as a whole" (39).</page><page sequence="21">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 27 possibility of topical allusion, nor is such a denial logically required by his method54. As noted above, the banishment of encomiastically irrelevant personal allusions does not mean that allusions to the politic al life of the victor's city will be irrelevant55. More directly to K?hn ken's point, the fact that a myth is integral to the thematic development of the ode does not preclude its having other functions and associations; indeed, given a Bundian understanding of the genre, we would expect any possible allusion to be integrated into the ode's epinician program . I maintain that Nemean 8 is in fact highly political, but not in the overly narrow sense proposed by Wilamowitz and other historicists. Generic considerations determine the political nature of Nemean 8: to praise the victor is to praise the city57, and to praise the city is in every 54 See H. Lee, 'The Historical Bundy and Encomiastic Relevance in Pindar'*, Class. World 72, 1978, 65-70. 55 E. Cingano ('Problemi di critica pindarica', Quad. Urb. n.s. 2 [31], 1979, 169-182) argues convincingly for the existence of political (and personal) allusions in Pindar, but unlike Lee, does so from an anti-Bundian perspective (based largely on his overly narrow interpretation of an ode's "funzione encomi?stica" as consisting only of statements which directly and obviously praise the victor). 56 Although K?hnken admirably illustrates the consistency of the ode and the integration of the myth of Aias into the whole, he is wrong to claim that this removes the possibility that the myth may have an external, political referent. It is the nature of poetry to be polysemous: since the odes of Pindar are not natural phenomena, we need not apply Occam's Razor to their interpretation. G. Most (The Measures of Praise, G?ttingen 1985) incisively attacks this "dogma of monofunctionalism" (38-40). Re garding the most notorious case of alleged external reference by Pindar, Most convin cingly argues that Nem. 7 makes sense in and of itself, but that this does not preclude allusions to Pai. 6 perceptible only to those acquainted with the earlier poem; the ode is in effect designed for two complementary sets of listeners or readers (133-214). 57 Kurke notes that Pindar downplays the potential conflict between oikos and polis. Praise of the city is associated with praise of the victor; to praise the island's heroes necessarily entails praising the city as a whole. In Nem. 8 Pindar claims to represent not only his aristocratic patrons but the entire city, coming as a suppliant to Aiakos polios th9 hyper philas aston th' hyper tond', implying his adherence to the "model of reciprocal advantage between the oikos and the polis which is the ideal of megaloprepeia^ (Kurke 192). For the Aiakidai as possibly representative of an aris tocratic subset of the population of Aigina, see below n. 98. Kurke also observes that the older view of Pindar as an archaic poet unable to adapt to the polis is the result of Athenocentric and teleological biases in the work of earlier scholars (163 ff.). Along the same lines S. Said and M. Tr?d?-Boulmer ('L'?loge de la cit? du vainqueur dans les ?pinicies du Pindare', Ktema 9, 1984, 161-170)</page><page sequence="22">28 J. S. Carnes sense of the word a political act. Athletic competition and the fame it engenders are part of a zero-sum system for the winning of honor, in which prestige may be gained only at the expense of other competitors; what is true on an individual level is also true for cities58. If Aigina is naturally hospitable to strangers, it follows that other cities are less so; if Aigina is just, it must be more just than its rivals. The praise of Aigina in Nem. 8 has both internal and external functions: internally, to ameliorate class conflict and to allow the citizens to bask in the glow of Pindar's praise; externally, to spread the fame of Aigina and to increase its prestige at the expense of other Greek states. The main pitfall of traditional historicist interpretations of the ode is the tendency to insist on relating the myth to specific political events. There are two problems in this approach. The first is that our know ledge of the ode's historical circumstances is sketchy at best: the events of the Pentekonteteia are much debated, and the only evidence for dating the ode is internal, leading to highly speculative conclusions based on readings of the mood of the poem. Thus Finley's interpretation (156) of the Nem. 8's political import refers to the odes "unrelieved darkness", while Bowra (298) asserts that Pindar is "both indignant and frightened for Aigina". This method also relies on the assumed close correspondence between the objective reality of Aigina's political situa tion and the myths which comment upon it; such an assumption, as we will see below (pp. 37, 45 f.) is completely unwarranted. A second flaw in this approach results from the fact that myths in demonstrate the close connection between city-praise and victor-praise, dismissing the opposition between "aristocratic" epinician and "political" tragedy in concluding that epinician "n'est pas moins 'politique', c'est ? dire li? ? la polis, que la trag?die" (170). E. Thummer (Pindar: Die Isthmische Gedichte, Heidelberg 1968, 54-64; 114-117) enumerates the instances of city-praise without substantial analysis of their function. 58 For the intense competitiveness of Greek life, see J. Burckhardt, Griechische Kulturgeschichte, Stuttgart 1908, 4,89-126; the zero-sum model was first formulated by A. Gouldner, Enter Plato, New York 1965, 49-51. Pindar's exultation in the shame of defeated athletes at 01. 8,67-69 and Pyth. 8,81-87 typifies this ethos. Kurke (15-34) argues that the zero-sum nature of kleos makes those who seek it journey away from home: strife within the oikos or polis is inappropriate, and an external locus for competition and aggression must be sought. Thus athletic competi tion is by nature a contest between citizens of different cities, and the journey of the hero and his return with kleos becomes a central theme of the epinician genre. Con versely, internal conflict within the polis is de-emphasized in favor of the externaliza tion of all potential rivals of the winner and his family (163-224). Within this framework praise of the city may be seen as an assertion of the unity of city and victor.</page><page sequence="23">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 29 the epinician tend to be conservative and resistant to change, thus re ducing the possibility of their adaptation to comment on specific events. The Pindaric use of myth as a timeless paradigm for the human condition applies to both individuals and cities. Indeed the city, like the family, may be seen as providing continuity between generations59, validating Pindar's view that human excellence is inherited. Pindar's treatment of cities emphasizes their unchanging, essential qualities: the Aiakidai are relevant because their glory guarantees the glory of Aigi na, and because their glory is the glory of Aigina. The presence of event-specific allusions is not impossible, but the difficulty of isolating such allusions from the paradigmatic background of the myth is formid able indeed60. I wish to propose a new model for the interpretation of the politics of Nemean 8. Rather than examining the myths in isolation, I will com 59 Kurke 15-19. 60 Contributing as well to the conservatism of Pindaric myth is the poet's desire to use local myths, which are limited in number and extremely familiar to his audience (Tragedy's greater range of subject matter contributes to the genre's differing treatment of myth; see n. 67 below). A reference to Aiakos or Aias would carry with it a whole chain of associations (the essential justice and excellence of Aigina; the spread of Aiginetan glory to other lands; etc.) which would have to be supplemented or displaced by any topical allusion. In some cases this might be accomplished by using an obvious "trigger" ? an innovation or inconcinnity in the myth which would point away from its customary interpretation and toward a topical one (for such a trigger in Nem. 8 see p. 46 below). In other cases Pindar may have tapped into currently popular political readings of a myth, which would reduce the need for an obvious trigger, making the allusion all but imperceptible to outsiders. As noted above (p. 20), we must not under estimate the degree to which Pindar was familiar with Aiginetan traditions; see Carnes, The Use of Aiakos. Similarly the epinician audience had, as Cingano points out ('Pro blemi' 175) "(una) competenza... pi? ampia, sotto ogni aspetto, di quella dello studioso odierno... Ne consegue che le oscurit? contenute nelle allusioni... sono tali soltanto per noi" (italics in original). Reinforcing this view is Most's observation (11-20) that Pindar's poetry was not noted for obscurity in the ancient literary tradition, as well as his assertion that an ode could be simultaneously directed toward audiences posses sing varying degrees of familiarity with its mythic background. Pindar himself fre quently sets up a dichotomy between the more and less knowledgeable members of his audience (Nem. 7,17 ff. ; 01. 2,86 ff. ; Pyth. 5,107 ff.). Thus there is a strong possibil ity that parts of Nemean 8 may be specifically coded for Aiginetan interpretation while at the same time bearing a different set of messages comprehensible to outsiders. It is sobering to realize the extent to which such allusions must always evade us: some such analogy as Aias: Odysseus:: Aigina: Athens could have thoroughly permeated the political discourse of Aigina, both internal and external, for a period of years leading up to the composition of Nem. 8, without our being any the wiser.</page><page sequence="24">30 J. S. Carnes pare them to the self-representational myths of the Athenians, particu larly those of the Attic Funeral Oration61. The comparison to the funer al oration arises out of necessity: there is simply not enough direct evidence for the social, religious and literary life of Aigina (or of any other Greek state) to permit an adequate assessment of its program of self-representation62. Thucydides' hypothesis concerning the future reputation of Athens (1,10) has proven true: we are unwillingly Athe nocentric, and to try to understand the sparse remains of Aigina we must look at Athens' copious monuments and argue from analogy. The funeral oration is clearly a different genre from the epinician, and the Athenians and the Aiginetans did not exactly share the same political outlook. Nevertheless both states traced their origins to auto chthons, and since the Athenians habitually used their claims to auto chthony for political ends, an examination of those claims may yield insight into the role of autochthony in Nemean 8. In addition, the attractiveness of the model is increased by the important similarities between the epinician and epitaphios in terms of their function, their treatment of myth, and their direction toward audiences comprised of both citizens and foreigners. First, both the epinician and the epitaphios, forming part of cere monies integral to the life of the community, exhibit a number of structural similarities. Athletic contests are ritualized combat, and the experiences of the epinician victor and the dead soldier conform equal ly to van Gennep's typology of rites de passage: each has journeyed away from home, faced danger, won kleos, and returned from the ex perience profoundly changed and enjoying a new status within the 61 For the sake of convenience I will refer to the myths in question as epitaphic or funeral oration topoi, regardless of source. Since the topoi found in the funeral oration turn up in other genres (speeches in Herodotus and Thucydides; Tragedy; non epitaphic orations), we cannot claim that they are exclusively epitaphic; nor may we claim that they were created specifically for the epitaphios. Versions of the major motifs had been circulating in some cases for many years (Athenian autochthony is mentioned at //. 2,547-548, which, while possibly a late interpolation into the Catalog of Ships, nevertheless predates the epitaphios). Their infiltration of other genres would indicate that these important, self-defining myths must have circulated throughout the city in a variety of forms, both official and unofficial. 62 Thus H. Strasburger ('Thukydides und die politische Selbstdarstellung der Athener', Hermes 86, 1958, 17-40) must confine his study to Athens; for other cities "versagen uns sowohl Thukydides wie andere Quellen eine Darstellung ihrer politis chen Individualit?t und Programmatik fast vollst?ndig" (18).</page><page sequence="25">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 31 community63. Kurke argues (15-34) that the epinician ceremony marks the r?int?gration of the victor into his society: his successful return from competition completes the "loop of nostos". Similarly, the funeral may be conceived of as a ceremony of r?int?gration: the dead give up their liminal condition as corpses and are accepted into their new status as ancestors64. As Kurke shows (62-82), the epinician marks the continui ty of the oikos and the city which it honors: while celebrating the glo rious deeds of the present, it rehearses those of the past and hopes to ensure those of future generations. She notes the prevalence of funeral libation imagery in Pindar; the libations are the gift of the community to the dead, the recompense for their labors and the gifts (life, kleos) which they have bestowed on their descendants. Similarly, the victors are praised for their ponos and dapane on behalf of the city; the epini cian is conceived of as their apoina (Kurke 108-116). The funeral ora tion similarly makes explicit the link between the past and present: the feasts of earlier Athenians are recounted at length, and the labor and sacrifice of the current dead are rewarded with praise65. The metaphor ic funeral of the epinician is literal for the epitaphios; and as the epini cian is directed away from the individual laudandus and toward the 63 As Nagy points out (Pindar's Homer 118-145), the major athletic festivals were replete with the symbolism of death and re-birth, serving both as initiatory rites for the participants and as compensation for the death of the heroes in whose honor they were founded. 64 See J. Redfield, Nature and Culture in the Iliad, Chicago 1975, 179-182 for the shared liminality of the dead and the bereaved. In the case of Athens there is a spatial r?int?gration as well, since Athens, unlike other cities, brought its fallen sol diers home for burial (Thuc. 2,34). 65 As in the epinician, the deeds of the laudandi are described in the language of commerce and gift-exchange: cf. Thuc. 2,43,2; Dem. 60,32; Hyper. 24 (the dead exchange their bodies for praise or fame); Lys. 2,62 (their lives are exchanged for the freedom of the survivors); Menex. 237A (they purchase the safety of the city with their deaths). Service to the city is not surprisingly a commonplace (Thuc. 2,42,3; Dem. 60,18, 19, 27, 29; Lys. 2,70); the glory of previous generations is depicted as an inheritance (Thuc. 2,36,1-2; Men. 247B, where Plato speaks of a thesauros of doxe); and the dead are said to deserve recompense from the living (Men. 236D, 248C; Lys. 2,75, with the latter two passages referring to the giving of charis to the dead [for this topos in Pindar see Kurke 67-70]). The most explicitly epinician image in the epi taphic corpus is Thuc. 2,46,1, where Pericles says that the city, in its performance of funeral rites and its care for the children of the dead, has established an ophelimon Stephanen... ton toionde agonon for the dead and their survivors, and speaks of the athla... aretes megista as a motivation for their courageous behavior.</page><page sequence="26">32 J. S. Carnes larger community (oikos or polis) of which he is a part (Kurke 19 ff.), so to an even greater degree is the epitaphios, whose primary laudandi are the dead. Indeed, the Athenian public funeral may be in origin an attempt to appropriate and democratize the celebrations of individual oikoi, serving as an egalitarian and polis-wide version of the 66 epinician . The second resemblance between the genres, their treatment of myth, follows from the first. Since the primary purpose of each genre is the celebration of the community and its continuity through time, myth is treated conservatively: the mythic past serves as a paradigm which reveals the essential, timeless truths about the community67. Third, both epinician and epitaphios, while intended primarily for the citizens of the polis for which they were composed, were disseminated to a wider audience and may have carried messages specifically for that wider audience. In the case of the epinician, the allusions to Pindar in Aristophanes and Plato (and indeed the very survival of the odes) attest that they were of more than purely local character68. In the case of the funeral oration, foreigners were allowed not only to attend the oration but to take part in the procession which preceded it (Thuc. 2,34,4); their presence is alluded to by both Pericles (Thuc. 2,36,4) and De 66 On the essentially democratic character of the Attic funeral oration, see N. Loraux, L9 invention d'Ath?nes, Paris 1981, 42-50. 67 The use of myth in these genres may be contrasted with Tragedy, which is often accused of deforming myths. D?tienne (Dionysos mis ? mort 34-35) claims that in Pindar "la r?interpr?tation du r?cit mythique est parfois si nette et si tranch?e qu'elle se pr?sente sous la forme d'une correction apport?e au r?cit"; while in the case of Tragedy "le mythologue... devra sans doute faire pr?c?der son analyse du mythe par celle de la trag?die correspondante, de mani?re ? y d?celer les modes de r?interpr?ta tion et les formes de distortion sp?cifiquement tragiques". I see the problem as lying primarily not, as D?tienne would have it, in the confrontation between civic and heroic values, nor, as Charles Segal (Tragedy and Civilization, Cambridge Ma. 1981, 1-43) maintains, in Tragedy's tendency to deny to myth its function of mediation. Rather, it is the problem of representation and its attendant mimetic fallacy: that tragic charac ters (and epic ones as well) must be treated as real people, exhibiting emotions, under going diachronic development, and being subject to sequences of cause and effect not found in the more simply paradigmatic and synchronie tellings of the myth. In Tragedy and Epic, distinguishing myth from the text which carries it is highly problematic. 68 For the circulation of the odes and their preservation within aristocratic and other traditions, see J. Irigoin, Histoire du Texte du Pindare 8-20; Kurke 5. The famous Rechtfertigungsproblem of Nem. 7 suggests that Pindar's work reached a geog raphically diverse audience; no matter what the ode's actual relation to Paian 6, the story's credibility in antiquity stands as evidence for the poems' wide dissemination.</page><page sequence="27">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 33 mosthenes (60,13), while Plato (Menex. 235B) hints that one of the principal aims of the epitaphios was to impress foreigners69. Moreover, funeral oration topoi were used not only within the city but also served to further Athenian claims in public discourse with other states70. The myths of the epitaphios were central to the Athenians' program of self representation; there is every possibility that the myths of Nem. 8 served the same function for Aigina. Although extensive evidence for other states is lacking, there are numerous suggestions that Athens' propaganda program was not uni que, either in the sort of claims that it made or in its ways of using myth. We find, for example, the Athenians' incessant claim to have been the saviors of Greece (from the Persians at Marathon and Salamis in historical times; from the Amazons in myth)71 paralleled in the de dicatory epigrams of various states (including Corinth, Megara, and Tegea) for victories in the Persian War and in the Spartans' correspond ing role as the self-styled liberators of Greece72. The Athenians attemp ted to justify territorial claims and to make political points by using the heroes of other cities: either by appropriating them (Aiakos, Aias, Theseus, Triptolemos; see n. 91 below) or by showing their subordina tion to Athenians (the various kings subjugated by Theseus). Similarly, Sparta used the bones of Orestes to press its claim on Tegea (Hdt. 69 Menex. 235B: kai hoia de ta polla aei met' emou xenoi tines hepontai kai synakroontai pros hous ego semnoteros en toi parachrema gignomai: kai gar ekeinoi ta uta tauta dokousi moi paschein kai pros eme kai pros ten allen pol?n, thaumasioteran auten hegeisthai einai e proteron, hypo tou legontos anapeithomenoi. 70 At Thuc. 1,72 ff., the unnamed Athenian envoys use epinician topoi in their attempt to dissuade the Spartans and their allies from declaring war; at Hdt. 7,161 the Athenians use these topoi to argue for their right to command the fleet at Salamis; at 9,27 they are similarly used to argue for the honor of commanding the right wing at Plateia. In the fourth century, Isocrates made frequent use of the topoi in his Panhelle nic speeches (e.g., 4,97; Arch. 42; Areop. 75; Panath. 193; Paneg. 55; 58; 68-70; Plat. 53). Cf. Strasburger, passim. 71 For the homology between these events and the lack of distinction between myth and history, see n. 108. 72 For the epigrams, see W. C. West, 'Saviors of Greece', Gr. Rom. Byz. Stud. 11, 1970, 271-282 (here 278-280). The Spartans' claim to have been the liberators of Greece (Thuc. 1,69,1, etc.) seems to have been based on their leadership against the Persians as well as on their suppression of tyranny. Pindar himself implicitly recog nizes Sparta and Athens as the joint saviors of Greece at Pyth. 1,71 ff., where their victories against the Persians are compared to those of Hieron over the Etruscans and Carthaginians.</page><page sequence="28">34 J. S. Carnes 1,66-69), and used genealogy to assert hegemony over Mycenae7 . The Athenian conflict between autochthony and Ionian kinship is paralleled by the Spartans' dual heritage as Dorians and Achaians74; and both Athens and Sparta used myth to claim leadership of the Ionian and Dorian ethne75. Although the specifics of the funeral oration's topoi and the conditions of its performance are unique to Athens, its use of myth is not and may be typical of fifth century political propaganda. Objection may be made to the model on chronological grounds: Nemean 8 cannot be later than 438, while the extant funeral orations date mostly from the fourth century, with the earliest of them (that of Pericles in 431/430)76 being somewhat atypical of the genre. Against this objection we must weigh the following. First, the funeral oration probably originated shortly after the Persian Wars77, while epitaphic topoi are found in Herodotus, indicating that the myths were circulating in some form at a relatively early date. Second, the topoi in the funeral oration are an extreme case of the conservatism of myth, remaining largely invariant over the century from Herodotus to Demosthenes78. 73 See C. Brillante, 'Myth, Ritual and History', 93-138 (here 98-99) in Approaches to Greek Myth, L. Edmunds ed., Baltimore 1990. 74 The conflict between autochthony and Ionian heritage in Athens parallels that between alliances based on contiguity and those based on consanguinity; cf. Cleis thenes' redistribution of the phylai (Hdt. 5,66) and Euripides' Ion. I am grateful to K. R. Walters for sharing with me a draft of his unpublished paper 'Attic Autochthony, Ionian Kinship, and the Basis of Athenian Citizenship'. For the dichotomy between Dorian and Achaian heritage, see Hdt. 5,72; for that between Dorian and Aiakid heritage on Aigina, see n. 21 above and n. 98 below. 75 For Athens and the Ionians, see J. P. Barron, 'Religious Propaganda of the Delian League', Journ. Hell. Stud. 84, 1964, 45-48; ibid. 82, 1962, 6 and n. 40. On the extent of "true" Dorian and Ionian feeling in the fifth century, J.

Walters ('Rhetoric as Ritual: The Semiotics of the Attic Funeral Ora tion', Florilegium 2, 1980, 1-27 [here 19 n. 3]) sees Paus. 1,29,4-5 as derived from an early epitaphios; there also exist fragments of Pericles' Samian funeral oration of 440. 77 Strasburger (21-22) takes the early development of the funeral oration as almost certain, citing the evidence of epitaphic topoi from Herodotus and tragedy. Walters ('Rhetoric' 22-23 n. 26) discusses the evidence in detail, reaching the same conclusion. Loraux (L'invention 56-60) argues for a more gradual development of the genre; yet she provides no evidence against the early development of the mythic topoi themselves. 78 So invariant are the speeches that the authenticity of those attributed to Lysias</page><page sequence="29">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 35 The probability that the topoi were being used for political ends in the middle decades of the fifth century is extremely high. The program of the Attic Funeral Oration makes use of five stan dard mythic exempla: the autochthony of the Athenians; their repulsion of the Amazon invasion; their repulsion of the invasion of the Thracians under Eumolpus; their insistence on the burial of the Seven Against Thebes; and their help for the Herakleidai. In addition, there is the historical topos of the Athenians' stand against the Persians at Marathon, as well as a number of assertions of the uniqueness of the city and its institutions79. In examining these motifs we may find the following correspondences to the mythic program of the Aiginetans: 1. Claims of autochthony The Athenians were obsessed with their autochthony. References to it are frequent throughout Attic literature, and autochthony was an important part of the way the Athenians portrayed themselves to other states80. The Athenians claimed that they were the only81 autochthons and Demosthenes has often been challenged. As Walters points out ('Rhetoric' 16-19), the ritual character of the funeral oration rendered it highly resistant to change. Plato's remarks on the effect of the epitaphios on its audience (Menex. 235A-C), although parodie, confirm that the purpose of the funeral oration was not to inform but to inspire in its audience an almost mystical sense of self-satisfaction. The epitaphios of Hyper ides, generally dated to 322, is anomalous among extant orations in its near-total omission of mythic exempla (only the autochthony motif is retained) and in its detailed praise of an individual. The apparent disintegration of the genre may reflect the de cline of the democratic ideology which fostered it. For a discussion of the chronological problems involved in the interpretation of non-Pindaric sources for Aiginetan myth, see n. 96 below. 79 The main sources for the individual topoi are as follows: Burial of the Seven: Menex. 239B; Dem. 60,8; Hdt. 9,27,3; Eur. Suppl. passim; Isoc. Paneg. 55, 58; Defeat of the Eumolpidai: Menex. 239B; Dem. 60,8; Defeat of the Amazons: Menex. 239B; Dem. 60,8; Lys. 2,4-6; Rescue of the Herakleidai: Lys. 2,11-16; Menex. 239B; Dem. 60,8. 80 The earliest reference to Athenian autochthony is found in Homer (//. 2,547 548). References to the Athenians as autochthones or gegeneis are found in all Attic genres, where they are also called the descendants of the autochthons Erechtheus, Kekrops and Kranaos. For a full catalog, see E. Ermatinger, Die attische Auto chthonensage bis auf Euripides, diss. Berlin-Z?rich 1897. We will be concerned here with the most specifically political uses of the myth, for which the sources are primari ly epitaphic. 81 The claim to exclusive autochthony is a commonplace of the funeral oration and related sources: cf. Hdt. 7,161; Thuc. 2,36,1; Lys. 2,17; Plato, Menex. 237B;</page><page sequence="30">36 J. S. Carnes in Greece; this not only ensured their legitimacy82, but also their primacy over other Greek states. The Athenians claimed to have in vented agriculture, among other things83, and thus to have been the benefactors of the rest of Greece. The Athenians' unique autochthonous status also made them the "first" of the Greeks84, and enabled them to claim privileges on that basis. Isocrates (4,63) rebukes the Spartans for claiming to be superior to the Athenians, saying that epelydes should not set themselves up over autochthons85. A surprisingly specific use of "autochthony privilege" may be found in Herodotus (7,161), where the Athenians assert that their autochthony (along with the status of Menes theus in the Iliad) gives them the right to command the Greek fleet at Salamis86. Hyperides 6,7; Demosth. 60,4; outside the epitaphic tradition, Isocr. 12,124; De mosth. 19,261; Ar. Vesp. 1076. (Given the existence of other autochthonous tradi tions, this claim must not have been universally accepted outside of Athens). The insistence on being monoi, on the uniqueness of Athenian institutions and character, was an id?e fixe in the genre; see nn. 83, 84 below. 82 Cf. Lys. 2,17: autochthones ontes ten auten (se. gen) ekektento kai meter? kai patrida. On questions of legitimacy and the role of women in autochthony myth, see A. Saxonhouse, 'Myths and the Origins of Cities: Reflections on the Autochthony Theme in Euripides' Ion, in Greek Tragedy and Political Theory, J.P. Euben ed., Berkeley 1986, 252-273. Descent from autochthons assured political legitimacy within the state: at Plut. Thes. 13,2 and 32,1 Theseus' rule is challenged on the grounds that he is a xenos kai epelys. 83 Cf. Demosthenes 60,5 and Plato, Menex. 237E-238A on the invention of agri culture; also Hdt. 5,89 on the Athenian monopoly on the olive. For other inventions cf. Pliny, Nat. hist. 7,197, where the discovery of silver is attributed to Erichthonius (Pliny's sources attribute similar discoveries to other autochthons, including Aiakos). The above-cited passage from Hesiod (fr. 205 M.-W.) also shows the Aiginetans as protoi heuretai: there the Myrmidons protoi zeuxan neas amphielissas I protoi d'histi ethen neos ptera pontoporoio. 84 The uniqueness of Athens and its institutions pervades the epitaphios and related sources (most egregiously at Lys. 2,17 ff.). For the insistence on uniqueness as an attempt to valorize Athenian isolation, see Walters, 'Rhetoric' 3-8; for protos and monos as part of the Athenians' complex process of self-definition, see Loraux, L'invention, passim. 85 The opposition of autochthon and epelys was common in Athenian political discourse: in addition to the above-cited passages from Plutarch, cf. Hdt. 1,78; 4,197; 5,65,3; Lys. 2,17; Isoc. 4,24; 12,124; Plato, Menex. 237B; Dem. 60,4. 86 Cf. also Hdt. 9,27, where the Athenians claim to command the right wing at the battle of Plateia is based in part (despite the speaker's praeteritio) on the deeds of</page><page sequence="31">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 37 Perhaps the most significant use of autochthony by the Athenians was their claim that their autochthony made them inherently just: they were the only Greeks not to have expelled the previous inhabitants of their land. Demosthenes could go so far as to claim that the Athenians had never wronged anyone (edikesan men oudena popot' outK Hellen oute barbaron, 60,5); Lysias also specifically connects the Athenians' justice with their arche... dikaia (2,17), where the arche dikaia in para digmatic fashion guarantees the justice of all their subsequent actions. The Attic funeral oration is an apologia for the Athenians' conduct, for their very way of life, and the insistence on innate justice is in large part a defense of Athens' imperial program87. This apologia includes assertions which would prove incredible to other Greek states, or which are demonstrably false88. Myth and history form a seamless web in the epitaphios (see p. 41 below), and myth, with its resistance to outright denial, removes from the realm of logical debate those propositions which could not withstand close scrutiny. As Paul Veyne points out, the Greeks acquired habits of mythic thought from earliest childhood; even the most skeptical thinker, such as Thucydides or Aristotle, does not deny the existence of heroes, but "croit d'abord et ne doute que sur les details o? il ne peut plus croire"89. Autochthony myth succeeds in their mythic ancestors. Although not specifically an autochthony-related claim, it de rives from the epitaphic tradition, in which autochthony figured prominently. 87 Specific justifications include: Pericles' claim at Thuc. 2,40,4-5 that the Ath enians are the only Greeks who do good to others without calculation of self-interest; Demosthenes' contrast (60,18) of the Athenians' foresight and willingness to act for the common good with the ignorance and spitefulness of other Greek states; Lysias' catalog (2,54-57) of the benefits brought to other states by the Athenian empire. For an overall view, see Strasburger 20 ff. ; Walters, 'Rhetoric'; Loraux, Uinvention, passim. For the epitaphically-influenced speech at Sparta (Thuc. 1,72 ff.) as typical of Athenian self-representation, see de Romilly 242-272; for its doubtful authenticity, ead. 242-243. 88 In addition to Demosthenes' claim that the Athenians never wronged anyone, we hear from Lysias (2,43) that the Athenians won the aristeia at Salamis (contra Hdt. 8,93, where the prize is awarded to Aigina). This disregard for external realities is replicated in the Menexenus, where Socrates claims that the Athenians not only fought alone against the rest of Greece in the Peloponnesian War (242C-D), but actually remained undefeated at war's end (243D). 89 Les Grecs ont-ils cru ? leurs mythes?, Paris 1983, 54 ff. ; 20. The epistemological problem is thus summarized by Veyne: "Les Grecs n'ont jamais admis que la fabulation pouvait mentir du tout au tout... car la connaissance n'est qu'un miroir; et le miroir se confond avec ce qu'il refl?te" (68). The notion that</page><page sequence="32">38 J. S.

Was Aiginetan autochthony politically charged? There is no reason to assume a priori that it wasn't, especially insofar as it coun tered Athenian claims to exclusive autochthony. There are, moreover, myths which seek to subvert or expropriate Aiginetan autochthony and which may have been politically motivated. Athenian and Spartan attempts to co-opt the heroes of other cities to support territorial claims are well-documented91, and the existence of two variant traditions concerning the Myrmidons may be part of this pattern. In the first variant, traceable to Theogenes' treatise on Aigina (FGrHist 300)92, the Myrmidons are not ants, but men with ant-like habits who are civilized by Aiakos, who is a native not of Aigina but of the P?loponn?se. The second, reported by Servius (ad Aen. 4,402), tells of Myrmix, a young woman of Attica who is changed into an ant after attempting to take credit for the invention of the plow, which had belief is more basic to the human psyche than doubt (and that even preposterously false statements must first be believed before being rejected) has recently received support from experimental psychology (a summary of current research is found in Science News 139, 1991, 14-15). See also H. Bergson, Creative Evolution, New York 1944, 310-313. This does not mean that mythic statements cannot be denied; mythic claims are regularly opposed by counter-claims. Yet the inelasticity of mythic thought sets the terms of the debate, and myth works in ways not fully perceptible to the conscious mind. Its mediating function works precisely because it is not rational; we may recall L?vi-Strauss' famous dictum that myths "think in men without their knowledge". 90 The longevity of the genre and the invariability of its motifs attest to their efficacy within Athens. For the effect on other cities, Socrates' assertion (Menex. 235B) that he is semnoteros, and Athens thaumasiotera, in the eyes of foreigners is parodie, but probably hyperbolic rather than ironic (just as his description of his own reaction to the speech [235A-C] is an exaggeration of the response of the Athenians). 91 Aiakos himself was a target of Athenian co-optation (Hdt. 5,89). The Athe nians also adopted the Salaminian autochthon Kychreus (Plut. Thes. 10; Solon 9) to bolster their claim on the island, in addition to their well-known attempts to claim Aias as ancestral xenos (Hdt. 5,66; Plut. Solon 9-10) and even as ancestor (Pherekydes ap. Apldr. 3,12,7 makes Telam?n the son of the Athenian Aktaios). Cf. also the burial of Oedipus and the Seven on Attic soil and the Spartans' recovery of the bones of Orestes to claim hegemony over Tegea (Hdt. 1,66-69). 92 Theogenes (FGrHist 300) ap. Schol. ad Pind. Nem. 3,13 is the basis for the accounts of Tzetzes (ad Lye. 176) and Strabo (8,375).</page><page sequence="33">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nem an 8 39 in fact been invented by Minerva. Myrmix becomes the eponym of the ant, and the account concludes with Jupiter's transformation of ants into Myrmidons93. In each case the myth, being at its core resistant to change, is not denied altogether94, but redirected to a particular end, with the Aiginetans owing their origin to another state: the former makes them in effect a Peloponnesian settlement, while the latter makes Attica the original site of the Myrmidons, co-opting their autochthony95. We cannot of course be certain of the motivation for the changes, particularly given the fact that these versions of the myth are preserved in sources centuries later than the period in question96; yet these variations conform to the pattern for politically tendentious treat ments of myths of origin, and the subversion of Aiginetan claims to autochthony by two of its most powerful rivals looks suspiciously poli 93 Other possible examples of Athenian attempts to subvert the Aiginetan myths of Aiakos and the Myrmidons include Pherekrates' comedy Myrmekanthropoi and the depiction of Aiakos in Ar. Ran. Yet in the former case we have no information con cerning the contents of the play, and in the latter Aiakos is mocked no more severely, and to no more obvious political intent, than are other heroes and divinities (in particu lar Dionysus). To the extent that the portrayal of Aiakos in the Ranae is political, it is in the change from Aiakos as Aiginetan autochthon to gate-keeper of Hades, a role which became his chief claim to fame throughout later antiquity, but for which we have no Aiginetan evidence (although the role of underworld judge is consistent with other aspects of his depiction by the Aiginetans). Aiakos has been transformed from a poten tially dangerous figure (a powerful hero of an autochthonous state) into a politically (if not eschatologically) harmless judge of the dead. The genesis of the Myrmidons from ants is also implicitly opposed in Homer and the Scholia; see West, Hesiodic Catalogue 163. 94 Euhemerization does not fundamentally alter the structure of a myth, but pro vides instead a different basis for understanding its "illogical" features. Surface-level transformation is another matter: while Theogenes' account is still about the equation Aiginetan "ants"=men, the Aiginetans have been deprived of their autochthony. The Myrmix story not only does not deny the literal transformation of ants into humans, but exhibits in addition many concerns (agriculture, sexuality, filial rebellion) typical of autochthony myths. See Carnes, The Use of Aiakos, chapter 2. 95 The creation of Myrmix may be seen as parallel to the invention of the epony mous Ion to claim primacy over the Ionians in the Delian League. 96 This does not, of course, mean that the myths themselves are as late as their sources; it is common to find early versions of myth fossilized in the works of scholars and mythographers; see Brelich 22; 44-45. Moreover, in regard to any possible altera tion we must ask cui bono? The impulse which made Aiakid myth a dynamic, local tradition ceased in 431, and the impulse to combat this tradition mythically must have faded as well, and ceased altogether with the destruction of the Athenian and Spartan empires.</page><page sequence="34">40 J. S. Carnes tical. If the Aiginetan autochthony myth was important enough to be co-opted by rival cities, its use in Nem. 8 is apt to be political as well. Autochthony's political potential may help explain its prominence in Nemean 8. The mere mention of autochthony assures the audience that the Aiginetans are not epelydes, but an indigenous people, worthy of privileged status among the Greek states (a status which Aiakos does in fact enjoy). Such assurance was perhaps particularly necessary in light of the foreign origins of various Aiakidai: both Peleus and Aiakos are connected with Thessaly, Telam?n with Salamis; in addition, the relation between Telam?n and Peleus is post-Homeric97. For the Aiginetans, claims of autochthony could serve as the ultimate weapon in a genealogical war: the birth of Aiakos from Aigina's soil makes Aigina, not Thessaly, the true source of the Aiakidai; in addition, auto chthony guards against the politically-motivated invention of epony mous ancestors such as Ion (a principle ingeniously evaded in the case of Myrmix). Given as well the problematic nature of the succession to Aiakos and the Aiginetans' mixed Aiakid/Dorian heritage, Pindar's assertion of their autochthony could hardly have been a casual one. As the Athenians used autochthony for both internal and external politics, so too may have the Aiginetans98. While Pindar does not make the explicit causal connection be 97 Over and above his connection with the Thessalian Zeus Hellenios, Aiakos is said to have founded a town in Thessaly (Steph. Byz. s.v. 'Dia'; Servius adAen. 4,402) and to have married Cheiron's daughter (Schol. Pind. Nem. 5,12; Schol. II. 16,14; Hyginus, Fab. 14). Homer of course connects Peleus with Phthia and makes no men tion of his exile (given the number of similar instances of exile in the Iliad, the omis sion would be striking if Homer accepted the story), nor of Aiakos' Aiginetan origin. Similarly, Homer acknowledges no relation between Achilles and Aias, implying that he did not view Peleus and Telam?n as brothers. Pherekydes' claim (ap. Apldr. 3,12,7) that Peleus and Telam?n were friends, not brothers, looks like an Athenian response to the Aiginetan genealogy. For an assessment of the Aiginetans' appropria tions of Thessalian myths see West 162-164. Cf. also the Athenians' appropriation of the Thessalian Xuthus. As noted above (n. 30), the cult of Zeus Hellenios in the fifth century was Panhel lenic in function, though not in name. The interpretation of the title Hellenios in its broader sense was advantageous to the Aiginetans, both in disguising the cult's Thessalian origin and in amplifying the importance of Aiakos' connection with the foundation of the cult. 98 For the Aiginetans' dual Aiakid/Dorian heritage, and the possible implications of this for our understanding of Aiginetan society, see T. J. Figueira, Aigina: Society and Politics, New York 1981, 299-306; and Nagy, Pindar's Homer 175-180.</page><page sequence="35">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 41 tween autochthony and justice found in the epitaphios, he follows the birth of Aiakos with a strong, almost exaggerated emphasis on the jus tice of his rule over other lands; and as we have seen, justice was a leitmotif throughout the myths of Aiakos. The Athenians' settlement of other states' disputes is paralleled by the judgment of Aiakos; and as the Athenians' rule is based on the willing submission of their allies, so is that of Aigina99. And like the Athenians, the Aiginetans are shown to be the benefactors of all Greece, both through the beneficent rule of Aiakos and through his resolution of the drought. Finally, the Athenian uses of autochthony show that this sort of self-representational myth need bear no relation to external reality. Confident assertions about the circumstances of the ode are worthless: the hegemony of Aiakos may reflect justified self-confidence in a time of prosperity, or may be an example of bravado or refusal to accept defeat. Within this framework even the gloom of the judgment against Aias becomes dislodged from any specific, identifiable historical con text. 2. The homology of myth and history The epitaphic version of the Amazonomachia seems at first glance an analog for the Persian invasion: in each case a horde of outlandish barbarians has come from the East, and in each case Athens has suc cessfully repulsed their attack. Yet the epitaphios does not explicitly link Amazons and Persians, and since the Amazons had occupied a prominent position in Attic cult and iconography from the early sixth 99 For Athens' insistence that its allies submitted willingly, and even asked it to build its empire, see Strasburger 24 ff.; Thuc. 1,75,2; 1,95,1; 1,130,2; 3,10,2. The language of eleutheria and douleia was at the heart of the Athenian and Spartan propaganda programs (Strasburger ibid.; de Romilly 80-97), and it is possible that Pindar's emphasis on the willing submission of the heroes is a deliberate counter to Athenian propaganda (the limitative force of ge implying that Aiakos, in contrast to Athens, did not employ force). Pindar's words may also place the actions of Aiakos in opposition to Athens' "justified" aggression against its rivals in securing the return of the Herakleidai and the burial of the Seven (as Walters points out ['Rhetoric' 12-14], the bellicose version of the burial of the Seven was probably current by the 450's, so such a response is chronologically possible). Such hypotheses are of course highly speculative: although we way demonstrate with some confidence similarities of form which suggest similar function, isolating responses to specific aspects of other states' propaganda will, as with finding allusions to specific events, remain largely beyond our reach.</page><page sequence="36">42 J. S. Carnes century1 , it might be argued that their presence in the epitaphios was determined by other factors and bore no specific relation to the historic al events of the fifth century. There is, however, a wealth of non epitaphic evidence for the assimilation of Amazons to Persians in the years following the Persian Wars, a process that did not supplant the myth's other functions, but which supplemented and even furthered them101. The historicizing Amazonomachia de-emphasizes or eliminates altogether the role of Theseus102, while assimilating the Amazons to other barbarian invaders103. They, like the Persians, attack Athens first in the hope of conquering all of Greece104; the Athenians alone were responsible for saving Greece, just as they were at Marathon105. Further confirmation of the association of the Amazons and the Persians may be found in the Attic festive calendar: the feasts commemorating the defeat of the Amazons and the Eumolpidai were held on the same 100 See D. von Bothmer, Amazons in Greek Art, Oxford 1957 and W. B. Tyrrell, Amazons: A Study in Athenian Mythmaking, Baltimore 1984. 101 The Amazon myth, like all myths, was capable of being read along several axes simultaneously, and the use of the Amazons to express Athenian pride in the defeat of the Persians co-existed with, and even furthered, their use as paradigms for Athenian conceptions of gender, marriage and hierarchy. See the excellent discus sions of P. duBois, Centaurs and Amazons, Ann Arbor 1982, 110-149; and Tyrrell 40-86. 102 In earlier versions of the legend the Amazons invaded to rescue their queen (Hippolyte or Antiope), who had been abducted by Theseus (sometimes with the aid of Herakles). The battle featured the Amazon queen fighting on the side of the Athe nians, with a truce ending the fighting. Epitaphic versions (of which Lysias 2,4-6 is the most detailed) maintain that the Amazons' motive for invasion was the conquest of Greece, and emphasize their utter defeat and the glory which accrued to Athens as a result. Similarly, the burial of the Seven Against Thebes becomes militarized in the mid-fifth century. A more complete list of sources on the homology of Amazons and Persians is found in Walters, 'Rhetoric' 25-26 n. 42. 103 They are associated with the Scyths at Diod. Sic. 4,28 and Isoc. 4,68-70; with the Thracian Eumolpidai at Isoc. Arch. 42; Areop. 75; Panath. 193; Paneg. 68-70; Plato, Menex. 239; Dem. 60,8; and Xen. Mem. 3,5,9. For the Amazons as the embodiment of cultural difference, see duBois 78-94. 104 jnjg strategy js attributed to the Persians at Lys. 2,21 and Isoc. 4,94; to the Amazons at Isoc. 4,68. ios rpne c}ajm to have fought alone at Marathon is both somewhat inaccurate (the contributions of the Plateans are deliberately ignored) and part of the Athenians' attempt to valorize isolation and abandonment as uniqueness (n. 84 above).</page><page sequence="37">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 43 day as the commemorative feast for the battle of Marathon106. Finally, the Amazons are said to have encamped at the base of the Areopagus, the site of the Persians' camp during their occupation of Athens107. The assimilation of the Amazons to the Persians, along with the parallel assimilation of the Eumolpidai, collapses the distinction be tween myth and history108. The historical topos, "We fought alone at Marathon", is not different in kind from the other five: at Hdt. 9,27 and Thuc. 1,73 Marathon, set in temporal opposition to the other topoi (ta palaia), is listed as the final and most significant of Athens' selfless accomplishments. The myths of the Amazons and the Eumolpidai are paradigms for the Athenians' bravery at Marathon; all three serve as paradigms for the Athenians' current and future actions. The "mythic" exemplar and the historical "fact" are united and largely indistinguish able. The epitaphic Amazonomachia aids our interpretation of Nem. 8 by showing both the political transformation of an already-existing myth and the ability of the politicized myth to retain a variety of functions. In the absence of festal calendars, Atthidographers and the like, the Ama zonomachia and the modified embassy myth present the same aspect: each myth has apparent relevance to an historical situation, yet since 106 According to Plutarch (Thes. 27,3) the battle with the Amazons was fought on the sixth of Boedromion, which was the date for the celebration of the victory at Marathon; not coincidentally, the victory over the Eumolpidai was also celebrated on this day. Walters ('Rhetoric' 25-26 n. 42) points out that the funeral oration may well have been delivered on the fifth of Boedromion, and that this month also marked the celebrations of the battles of Plateia, Mykale and Salamis. 107 For the Amazonian encampment, cf. Plut. Thes. 27,3; Diod. Sic. 4,28,2; Aesch. Eum. 685-690; for that of the Persians, Hdt. 8,52. 108 rpne funerai oration did distinguish between the myths (ta palaia) and history (ta nyn or ta hysteroi chronoi; see, for example Hdt. 7,161; Thuc. 1,73,2; 2,36,4; Lys. 2,26; Menex. 244D; Dem. 60,9), but on the basis of their antiquity, not their truth value. In distinguishing "myth" from "history" I am of course using the modern sense of those terms. For the Greeks' failure to make this distinction, and their failure to apply "scientific" methods to the study of the past, see Veyne, Les Grecs 52-68. As M. I. Finley observes: "The past can yield nothing more than paradigmatic support for the conclusions one has drawn from the present; the past, in other words, may still be treated in the timeless fashion of myth" ('Myth, Memory and History', Hist, and Theory 10, 1965, 281-302 [here 301]). Pindar himself explicitly links historical and mythic events at Isth. 5,43-50, where a list of the deeds of the Aiakidai culminates in an account of the battle of Salamis.</page><page sequence="38">44 J. S. Carnes the shared assumptions of author and audience obviate the need for explicit comparison, we may only infer that an actual relation exists. Although we cannot prove that the modified embassy myth commented upon fifth century politics, the very fact that it is formally similar to the Amazonomachia (even to the point of displaying what looks like specifi cally political alteration; see below) provides important evidence for its political motivation. We have earlier rejected monofunctionalism as applied to the in terpretation of a myth's function within an ode (n. 56); the Amazono machia shows that a political myth may have multiple functions within the community as well. Thus the use of the modified embassy as part of the epinician program (highlighted by Pindar's placing himself in the position of a hiketas Aiakou in v. 13) does not argue against its possible political significance. Similarly, neither the myth's obvious centrality to the religious life of Aigina, nor its possible relevance to the island's internal politics109 argue against its having an external political refer ence. The lack of distinction between myth and history broadens our perspective on the paradigmatic nature of the modified embassy myth: the depiction of Aigina's prominence in the Heroic Age is normative and should not be read as mere nostalgia. Yet myth as analog for pre sent-day events has as well descriptive and predictive value: Aigina is the greatest of Greek states, both morally and politically, and will con tinue to be so. As the Athenians' use of autochthony myths has shown us, such claims need not bear any relation whatsoever to external reali ties. 3. Myths directed against specific political rivals Of the funeral oration's five mythic topoi, three are directly con cerned with other Greek cities (the Eumolpidai with Eleusis, the Seven with Thebes, and the Herakleidai with Sparta); it is presumably not entirely coincidental that two of these myths concern precisely those cities which were Athens' most powerful rivals in the fifth and fourth centuries. Athens' beneficence toward other states and their resultant ingratitude is an epitaphic leitmotif (cf. Dem. 60,18: eis soterian hapantas parekalesan... kai tes para tois Hellesin agnoias memeigmenes 109 See n. 98 above, and Kurke's discussion of polis/oikos conflict (163-224), which may be defused here via Pindar's emphasis on his song as an agalma for Aiakos, the city, and its citizens.</page><page sequence="39">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 45 kakiai... [hoi Athenaioi] ouk emnesikakesan). The directing of this motif against Sparta and Thebes thus could allow the Athenians to claim moral and religious superiority over their enemies. Examination of non-epitaphic versions of the myths reveals both politically tendentious alterations of existing myth and explicit appeals to the authority of the myths to sanction Athenian actions. A more bellicose version of the burial of the Seven begins to occur in the mid fifth century: the Athenians now claim to have used military might rather than diplomacy to secure the burial110. The most prominent treatment of the Heraklids is Euripides' virulently anti-Spartan Herak leidai, in which Eurystheus prophesies (1030-1044) that the descen dants of the Herakleidai will not be properly grateful to Athens111. (A pro-Spartan reworking of the motif is found in Xenophon [Hell. 6,5,47], in which a Phliasian envoy urges the Athenians to follow up on their beneficence toward the Herakleidai with military aid for Sparta against Thebes)112. These myths narrow the Athenians' general claims of virtue 110 Even Athenian sources (Plut. Thes. 24, who quotes Philochoros and Aesch. Eleusinians) maintain that Theseus secured burial of the Seven with a treaty (Pliny, Nat. hist. 7,202 reports that this was the first treaty ever made). Walters ('Rhetoric' 12-14) sees the development of the bellicose version as connected with the Athenian Argive alliance and as a justification of Athenian aggression toward Thebes. See also Loraux's discussion (L'invention 67-69) of the epitaphios as reflective of Athenian policy toward Thebes, Sparta and Argos. 111 The assertion of Spartan ingratitude for the Herakleidai is also made explicit ly by Isocrates (Paneg. 62): hon echren ekeinous memnemenous medepot' eis ten choran tauten eisbalein, ex hes hormethentes tosauten eudaimonian katektesanto. For a discus sion of the political references in the Herakleidai, see G. Zuntz, The Political Plays of Euripides 81-87; 97-128. The burials of Eurystheus and Oedipus on Attic soil, like the building of a shrine to Aiakos, are typical of Athenian attempts to co-opt the heroes of dangerous rivals. 112 The Heraklid myths were also potent in non- and anti-Athenian propaganda. The Tegeans (Hdt. 9,27) could use their relations with the Herakleidai to make claims on Sparta, while a number of Attic communities were immune from Spartan attack during the Peloponnesian War owing to their Heraklid associations (cf. Ister, FGrHist 334 F 30; Diod. Sic. 12,45,1). K. R. Walters ('Political Codes and Cultural Contra dictions in Attic Mythology', Ancient World 2, 1979, 76-77) links these latter incidents to others showing a schism between Athens and the outlying Attic communities. In this context we may view the epitaphic topos of the Eumolpidai as another example of a specifically-targeted political myth, intended to justify Athens' hegemony over Attica. The Herakleidai formed only part of the Athenians' and Spartans' programs of mythic/religious self-justification; cf. Thuc. 1,126-135 on the mutual accusation of</page><page sequence="40">46 J. S. Carnes and direct them at specific targets; yet the composers of the epitaphioi do not feel the need to make explicit the myths' political subtext. The modified embassy myth seems similarly directed towards in dividual cities by Pindar's naming of Athens and Sparta as representa tive of the aotoi of the neighboring states which pay heed to Aiakos113. The reference is blatantly anachronistic since the Athenians, pace their claims to the contrary, were not especially prominent in the Heroic Age (witness the relative obscurity of Menestheus in the Iliad, the praise bestowed upon him in the Catalog notwithstanding). Even the reference to the Spartans is anachronistic: although they could legitimately be described as the aotoi of their time, the fact that Aiakos and Pelops were of the same generation makes the term Pelopeiadai glaringly inappropriate114. Pindar's familiarity with Heroic Age traditions is un questionable; his disregard of these traditions in favor of the political realities of the fifth century115 can only be deliberate, and cannot have impurity owing to the curses of the goddess and of Taenarus; also Ar. Lys. 1136-1156 and Xen. Hell. 6,5,33 for catalogs of favors the two cities owed one another. 113 For the embassy myth, as for the Aiginetan foundation myth, there exist variants of unknown date which may have been in origin politically tendentious. Apol lodorus (3,12,6) claims that the drought necessitating the embassy was brought about by Pelops' treacherous murder of Stymphalos, while Diodorus Siculus (4,60-61) assigns the blame to the Athenians for Aegeus' murder of Minos' son Androgeos. The account of Diodorus is particularly suspect: 4,59-63 is devoted to the deeds of Theseus, with Minos praying to Zeus for a drought which abates only when the Athe nians send their children to the Minotaur. Yet for no apparent reason the drought afflicts the rest of Greece as well, and the intercession of Aiakos rescues all but Attica. Given that Diodorus' account of Theseus ultimately derives from Attic sources, the inclusion of the embassy myth looks like an attempt to reduce its importance by cir cumscribing it within the Attic tradition. Such domestication would be consistent not only with Athenian co-optation of foreign heroes, but also with the narrowing of Aiakos from politically potent king and autochthon to non-political underworld judge (n. 93 above). The assigning of blame to particular cities may be an example of the sort of miasma-propaganda noted above for Athens and Sparta. 114 A further anachronism may be found in the phrase harmozon straton: if we interpret Stratos as "people" rather than "army" the emphasis on the people of Athens rather than on their ruling family may be a reflection of Athenian democracy. Bury (152) takes this for granted, citing as parallel the labros Stratos of Pyth. 2,87. Although in the latter context (a list of types of government) stratos refers to some form of democracy, it does not necessarily refer to Athens; Jebb (Journ. Hell. Stud. 3, 1882, 148-149) argues that it must indicate radical democratic groups in Sicily. Further, stratos is frequently used by Pindar for non-democratic states or peoples. 115 At Pyth. 1,71 ff. Pindar himself implicitly acknowledges the military pre eminence of Athens and Sparta in the fifth century.</page><page sequence="41">Myth and Politics in Pindar's Nemean 8 47 escaped the notice of his audience. As if the anachronism were not enough, Pindar foregrounds Athens and Sparta by placing hoi te kra naais ktl. at the start of the first epode, unexpectedly amplifying the subject (aotoi) of a sentence which is already syntactically complete. As is the case with the epitaphic Amazonomachia, the distance between tenor (Aigina in the Heroic Age) and vehicle (Aigina in the fifth cen tury) has all but collapsed. The modified embassy myth ceases to func tion as a paradigm or metaphor for the fifth century and instead becom es an almost literal statement about the fifth century. Given that the reference to Athens and Sparta is in some sense political, we are faced with the more delicate task of trying to determine precisely which political message it conveys. The usual interpretations of the ode's political import refer to specific historical incidents or situations which are reflected in the myth, with proposed contexts rang ing from Aigina's punishment for Medizing to the island's dismal situa tion after its submission to Athens116. The problem with these inter pretations is not that they are unverifiable (any attempt to relate a text to the world outside it will necessarily be so), but that they fail to take into account the dynamics of mythic propaganda. Not only does mythic propaganda tend to assert eternal truths rather than transitory ones, but the identification of event-specific allusions poses daunting theoretical difficulties for the modern critic (n. 60 above). Moreover, critics have based their conclusions on the politics o? Nem. 8 largely on their inter pretation of the mood of the ode: its connotation of despair, hope, pride, or defiance. Even if we can accurately assess the ode's emotional im pact on an Aiginetan audience, the extraordinarily flexible relation be tween myth and external reality removes any possibility of determining the ode's external circumstances on this basis117. The anachronism of the myth and its reflection of fifth century conditions is recognized even by those, such as K?hnken (21) and Carey (39 n. 18), who deny the passage any political reference. Neither Carey nor K?hnken, however, offers any ex planation of why Pindar might have chosen to tell the myth in this way. 116 Bury (145-146) concludes that the ode reflects Aigina's punishment by Athens and Sparta for submitting to the Persians. Bowra (412) argues for a somewhat later date, near the start of the war between Athens and Aigina, noting that the powers of Athens and Sparta must have been equally balanced at that time; Farnell (303) comes to a similar conclusion. Wilamowitz (407) dates the ode after 458, claiming that it reflects the Aiginetans' dismay when "Athen es niederdr?ckt, Sparta ihm nicht zu Hilfe kommt". Brown and Mullen argue that the ode is a response to the peace of 445. 117 Although the arguments of these scholars may be faulty and extremetly sub</page><page sequence="42">48 J. S. Carnes We are confronted with a paradox: in attaining greater understand ing of mythic propaganda we realize that there are probably more poli tical allusions in Pindar than we had previously imagined; yet we come to realize as well that we have no b?sanos to determine the precise meaning of any given allusion. What then can we say, with even a modicum of certainty, of the external political referent of Nem. 8? At the very least there is an opposition between Aigina and the other two states; an opposition whose motivation seems clear in the case of Athens, less so perhaps for Sparta, often conceived of as Aigina's Do rian ally. Yet in positing a long-standing, ethnically-based alliance be tween Aigina and Sparta we may be superimposing the conditions of the later fifth century upon the Pentekonteteia. Thomas J. Figueira makes a strong case for the Spartan-Aiginetan alliance arising relatively late, concluding that "Aigina, as late as the 460's, could continue an inde pendent policy course, hoping to stand aloof from both (Athenian and Spartan) alliances"118. The oppositional dynamic o? Nem. 8 seems to reflect this desire for independence, although the "creative reality" of political myth would allow such a wish to be expressed (or such a truth to be asserted) even after 458. The Aiginetans' claims to autonomy and strength are also in implicit opposition to the imperial propaganda of both Sparta and Athens, according to which both states acquire power with the consent of the ruled, and for the purpose of liberating those states from a feared oppressor. There is every chance that all three self-representational programs were in operation at the same time, and the theoretical opposition which we observe here may be a distant re flection of the real-life struggles of the three states. Syracuse University jective, we cannot dismiss their conclusions out of hand: in recognizing the flexible relation between myth and objective reality, and in acknowledging our near-total lack of corroborating evidence for the Aiginetans' program of self-representation, we are also forced to admit that we cannot definitively rule out a link between a given myth and an historical event or situation. Indeed, if the date of Nem. 8 is late enough, it is possible that it would have been read by an Aiginetan audience as commenting on more than one event; it is therefore possible that all the aforementioned interpretations are at least partially valid. 118 T.
