University of North Carolina Press. $ 3.00 Although certain phases of the life of the New World Negroes, especi- ally their folk-lore and religious practises, have been subjected to intensive study, the general outlines of their cultural behavior have rarely received any attention at all. Such beginnings in this direction as have been made have been submerged in the general assumption that practically all aboriginal African traits of culture have been stamped out by the repressions of slavery. So widespread is this assumption that today it is taken for granted by almost all students of the Negro, and it furnishes the basis for the subsidiary hypothesis that we must look to Europe of the late seventeenth century, rather than to Africa, for the sources from which the present-day behavior of the New World Negroes derives, - to Elizabethan England, for example, when the Negroes of the Unites States and the English-speaking colonies of the Caribbean Sea are being considered. To what extent is the assumption justified ? The answer to this question can only be vouchsafed us after long research, but I am con- vinced that the prevailing concept will be strikingly modified as further investigation is carried on. The value of Miss Beckwith's book lies in the fact that in giving us an ethnological account of the life of the Jamaican Negroes, it sets us upon a path of re-examination of this hypothesis that should lead to a new concept of the number of Africanisms which the New World Negroes have preserved. The African elements in the culture Miss Beckwith describes are many. A dance is a "play," as it is in Africa, trees have their tutelary spirits that make them good or bad; rum is used sacramentally as it is in the parent country; there are numerous ceremonies that are either actual elements in the West African fertility cult or imply strong survivals, water-spirits are reserved for pools and rivers, and not the sea, - such Africanisms meet the reader in the opening pages. As one gets farther into the material, they crowd more thickly. The whole spirit of family solidarity recalls African life, a solidarity, that, as in Africa, includes not only the living but the dead, who become the protecting ancestral spirits of those who survive. The Jamaican's individual food is charac- teristic of Africa; the etiquette which occurs when a visit takes place and the importance of not going hastily into the house of another, are none the less so. The term "duppy," for ghost, comes straight from Africa, and so do the beliefs concerning him, which are numerous. As</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. 3 3 3 in Africa, a child is lifted across a coffin of a dead parent; as in Africa, the body is raised and lowered three times before finally being rested in its coffin; as in Africa, it is dangerous, in washing a corpse, to bathe the back. Familiar to the Africanist is the indication given by the coffin of the deceased as to who has harmed him, equally familiar the in- junction that an odd, and not an even, number of men must dig the grave. The precautions to guard against the return of the ghost, and the means of wrapping the body so that the ghost may be recognised if he walks abroad, are just as familiar, as is almost all of the information which deals with evil magic, and the importance of a sorcerer's being able to control a spirit of some dead person to work his spells. I might thus follow Miss Beckwith's book through to the end, and fill pages with parallels that are to be gained from it, parallels that are sufficiently definite so that the Africanist would not merely conclude that many of the traits of behavior were African, but would be able to state "This is Ashanti," or "That is Yoruban." That this was not Miss Beckwith's purpose in presenting her data, does not in any manner make her book the less valuable. As a matter of fact, what she gives us here is the first ethnographic study of the life of any New World Negro people which, to my knowledge, has been attempted. She tries to see the culture of the Jamaicans as a whole, and she describes it as a unit as she would describe the culture of any distinct people. If there are defects in the treatment, they are the defects of a first study. One might wish for a better picture of the people them- selves as individuals and not so much generalisation as to what "they" do; one might desire more attention to the aberrations from the accepted patterns of conduct as well as descriptions of those patterns. Yet when one has finished the book, a fair comprehension of the manner of life of the Jamaican Negroes has been gained, and it is one that includes something of their material existence as well as their religious beliefs, of their techniques and economic life as well as their folk-lore and their relations with the world of the dead. Miss Beckwith's work, furthermore, stimulates questions that, in the search for their answers, force one to a consideration of the neighboring Negro peoples of the New World, and thus lead the way toward the examination of yet another major problem, the question of the unity of New World Negro culture. As an instance of this sort of query, one might consider the term Kromanti, a word that occurs again and again in the book. What is Kromanti ? In her account, she gives us a number of facts concerning it. We learn (p. 143) that "the Kromanti rebellion in 1760 was instigated by men who sold medicines to make men invulnerable." The Kromanti is associated most closely with the Maroons, a semi-independent people who in early times fought their way to freedom and forced the British to treat with them. These people, "probably" are composed "in large</page><page sequence="3">334 fournal of American Folk-Lore. part of the Kromanti stock to whom the Maroons today refer their tradition." The pact by which these Maroons were recognised in their freedom "was drunk in the old Kromanti fashion by the leaders' on both sides cutting their arms and letting their blood flow into a bowl whose contents was mixed with rum," (p. 185), although this was related to Miss Beckwith as tradition and is not corroborated by contemporary accounts. "The Maroons," one reads (p. 191), "know 'stronger obeah' than any other group; they are most cunning in herb magic; they command a secret tongue (the so-called Kromanti), and they know song in this speech 'strong enough to bewitch anybody'." On the same page, Miss Beckwith states that "I was told that the Accompong Maroons had a doll figure called 'Yumma' which ... represented old Nanny, 'Queen' of the Maroons, at the time of their first treaty with the whites. Rowe said that no bullets could touch their men during the conflict because old Nanny stood with her back toward the enemy, and, attracting all the balls to herself, caught them between her thighs just as boys sometimes catch a ball." Following this is a "Kromanti Death Song," and still farther on (p. 194) we read of the horn and the gombay drum, each with its secret name that her informant would not divulge to Miss Beckwith. Finally, (p. 211) we are given an early impression of the Kromanti music, characterised as "the most melancholy that I ever remember to have heard," the high notes "uncommonly wild, but yet sweet," and the lower "deep, majestic, impressive." Dr. Williams1 has derived the term Kromanti (or Coromantee, as the earlier records have it), from the African Ashanti people. Whether or not his reasoning is entirely tenable, the fact that there was an im- portant kingdom on the Gold Coast of West Africa named Coromantyne, and that many slaves were drawn from that region, is suggestive. But this does not answer the question of the significance of the Kromanti in present-day Jamaica, and to solve the puzzle we must turn, I believe, to the culture of another New World Negro group, to that of the Bush- Negroes of Dutch Guiana. Today these people, living isolated in the deep interior of the colony, possess a culture almost as purely African as was that of their forefathers who escaped from slavery as early as 1650. That they come from the same regions of Africa as the other New World Negroes is a proposition which I believe is capable of ample proof, although this is not the place for the presentation of the evidence. Suffice it to say that they have the tradition of deriving from the Ashanti, that Dahome is the name of one of their sacred cities, that the name of one of their clans, the Anago, is ample indication of their Yoruban derivation. They retain the same religious systems and names of deities as do their parental African groups and their language, at present a jargon, 1 Williams, J. J. "Hebrewisms of West Africa," New York, I930. Chap. I.</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews. 3 3 5 is full of words directly traceable to the languages of the people their traditions claim as ancestral. In the culture of these people we find that Kromanti is of major importance. To give the simplest outlines of the cult, Kromanti is spiritual force which protects a man in danger and assures him that no bullet can penet- rate his body, that no pointed or jagged thing can macerate his flesh. The Kromanti men are fighters, and their obia, when they are possessed by it, is "ugly," and "strong," to use native terms that would be inistantly understandable to any Jamaican Negro. The "Kromanti tongo" is the secret language of these warriors, and they shout their cries in it when they are possessed, and, without translating, will speak it into a phonograph horn. Thus, point for point, as Miss Beckwith describes the Jamaican Kro- manti, I recognise the Bush-Negro Kromanti. The "Kromanti stock" from which the Maroons have descended is Gold Coast, especially Ashanti stock, for the Ashanti, called Kromanti in the New World, were always the ring-leaders in slave insurrections and were noted for their bravery and fearlessness. The Maroon town "Accompong" derives its name from the name of the Ashanti god Nyankompong, who is the Great God of the present-day Bush-Negroes, if not from the Gold Coast town of Akropon which exists to the present. The Kromanti pact of drinking mingled blood and rum with a former enemy is known in Dutch Guiana, for it was this ceremony that sealed one of the treaties between the Bush- Negroes and the whites. "Kromanti obia is stronger than all other obia," says the Bush-Negro, and this, too corresponds to Miss Beckwith's account. The Kromanti songs which were recorded in the Suriname Bush are not very different in musical structure from the Jamaican one given us, nor is the general effect of the words essentially dissimilar from those reproduced in Miss Beckwith's book. As in Jamaica, the Bush-Negro Kromanti drum has a secret name, this name, significantly enough, being "Asante Kogbwa," the "Ashanti drum." Finally, there is, even in the culture of the Bush-Negroes, the parallel to the Nanny of the Jamaican Maroons. "Nanny," I imagine, is derived from the Ewe word "Nana" used to this day by the Bush-Negroes in its aboriginal signif- icance of "ancestress," and the same Ashanti term, which means "grandfather," and the figure mentioned in Miss Beckwith's account is to be understood in the light of the Bush-Negro "Kromanti Mama," one of the most sacred objects possessed by these people. It is a modelled human form, and its function is strangely like that of the Jamaican "Nanny," for it knows when danger is about and warns the Kromanti men of what threatens them. Before the men go out to fight, each places the Kromanti Mama on his head and sits on the stool on which she rests, and by doing so, each warrior places himself under her protection. If I have discussed the Kromanti at some length, it is because this term has long puzzled students of the New World Negro. Always used</page><page sequence="5">336 %ournal of American Folk-Lore. to refer to a type of slave, it seemed strange that it had no parallel among African tribal names. Yet we find that it has not only become a New World term for Ashanti Negroes, but has retained a spiritual significance which derives from Africa, and through a discussion of it we can see the more clearly how Miss Beckwith's data assume a starting- point for a tying together of New World Negro cultures. One might indicate correspondences on other traits as well, both between Jamaica and the remaining islands, between Jamaica and the Guianas, and between Jamaica and the United States. But enough has been said to show how Miss Beckwith's data provide a link in the chain of evidence that, considered point by point, must lead to an understanding of how the original cultural traits of the African slaves were retained in part, and in part changed, by contact with the various groups of European masters. One cannot, however, discuss Miss Beckwith's book and neglect to point out interpretations of various aspects of Jamaican Negro culture that differ from those given by her. In the main these arise from her lack of familiarity with the African literature, as well as from her failure to relate her data to known information from other New World Negro groups1. We may take, for instance, the matter of the "day-name." As is well known, day-names come to children at birth, for of these there are two sets of seven each, one for boys and one for girls. The names themselves, as Miss Beckwith tells us, are the same as those on the Gold Coast, and they seem to be very deep-rooted, for they are practically unchanged wherever they are found, persisting even in the United States, as witness such a well-known name as "Cuffee." Miss Beckwith says (p. 59) that "these names are generally known, but I could not discover that they were actually used today. Old Hannah French said the sorcerers employed them in 'setting obeah.' They are played with in literary composition or in teasing competitions, and it would seem as if the hesitation of some to have their 'day-names' known had no other motive than a dislike of nicknames." We can again turn to the practise of the Bush-Negroes, one for which there are numerous African parallels recorded, to see whether the Jamaican attitude toward having a day-name generally known cannot be otherwise accounted for. In Dutch Guiana, the day-name is sacred, and is never spoken by a person unless he is under possession by the spirits which communicate through him, or unless he is consulting a diviner. As in Jamaica, it is this day-name, known also in Suriname as the "Kra" or "soul-name," that the sorcerer calls when working black magic against its bearer. And it is this very definite reason, I suspect, ' An example which may be given is that of the absence of reference to Sir H. H. Johnston's "The Negro in the New World" where, in the chapter on Jamaica, both obiah and Kromanti are discussed not only as to African origins but New World affiliations as well.</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews. 337 rather than the generalised "dislike of nicknames" that accounts for the hesitancy of the Jamaican to tell his most important name, - his day- name. My feeling as to the truth of this interpretation becomes stronger when I read, a few lines farther, that in Jamaica, as in Suriname, the name by which one is generally known is not very important, and, as in Suriname, may be changed as fancy dictates, and this feeling becomes certainty when I read, still farther, that "so many Jamaican folk-tales turn ... on the discovery of a hidden name that I feel sure closer inves- tigation would reveal more traces of old African belief in sympathetic magic connected with the name." Still other interpretations call for question. Let us consider obeah. I cannot agree with Miss Beckwith that the derivation of the term is either the Egyptian word "ob" (the serpent) or the African "Obboney." "Obia," according to Professor Westermann, derives from the tutelary spirit of the river "Bia" which, in the Ashanti country, outgrew its local character and came to be the name for a power at once helpful to those it protects and terrifyingly harmful to those who offend it. In literature on the West Indies, "obeah" is synonymous with evil magic, and Miss Beckwith tacitly accepts this interpretation. On the basis of the Suriname data, to say nothing of some of Miss Beckwith's own statements, this interpretation does not stand. If we take the case among the Bush-Negroes first, we find that obia is a healing principle. First came the Great God; later, to help man cope with nature, he made obia. Obia is not in any sense anthropomorphic among the Bush-Negroes, and, according to Miss Beckwith, this is also the case in Jamaica. This is a significant correspondence, for among the Bush-Negroes obia is the only important spiritual principal that is not conceived as being a personality. These correspondences are reinforced when we find that in discussing another aspect of obia Miss Beckwith states that "I do not find ... any ruling character or spirit of evil in Edward's sense of the word in the modern idea of obeah," for such a conclusion is in com- plete agreement with Bush-Negro belief. It is rather to be doubted whether Miss Beckwith's explanation as to why snakes are feared is correct, as well as whether "the fact that the yellow snake in Jamaica eats eggs and sleeps in hollows of fig and cotton trees is perhaps one reason for the fear of eggs and of the duppy-haunted precincts of the cotton tree." The silk-cotton, in Jamaica as everywhere in the Antilles and West Africa, is the sacred seat of a powerful spirit, and eggs are fed it to propitiate it. The snake, as is well known, forms one of the most vital elements of the religious cults of West Africa, one that, in the form in which it has been carried over into Suriname and Haiti, makes it a matter serious enough for the Gods themselves to punish when certain kinds of snakes are killed. It is something of all of these beliefs, I imagine, that permeates the Jamaican fear and respect for snakes and cotton trees and eggs, and it is to this source we must 22</page><page sequence="7">338 7yournal of American Folk-Lore. turn for an explanation of their merging in a manner that has confused Miss Beckwith, as is apparent when we read, "The cult of the dead is strongly imposed upon the worship of the cottonwood, and the animistic idea of a tree spirit is less defined than that of a ghost of the dead har- boring in its branches." My principal objection to Miss Beckwith's explanations, however, comes at her derivation of the word "Pukkumerian," the name of a Jamaican sect that is distinguished for the ability of its members to work through the spirits of the dead. This term, Miss Beckwith tells us, has the etymology of "Pick-them-here," that is, "Dig here for the buried obeah," because "of the claim this cult makes to prophetic powers in detecting buried obeah." It is "in the wild back country given over to the real 'people of the bush' that the Pukkumerians have their homes," and these people understand the esoteric language which the spirits speak." I would suggest a different etymology for this word, one that is based on still another comparison with Bush-Negro culture. In the pantheon of these people, there is a group of spirits called "Apuku." They are little folk, who have a tongue of their own not known to the uninitiated, which those whom they possess speak when they are in a state of possession, and these little people are the guardian spirits of the bush. The similarity need not be labored, but it may be mentioned that the resemblance between the photograph of a Pukkumerian woman in a state of possession (opposite page 82) and the appearance of a woman under possession in the Suriname Bush or in the City of Parimaribo is most striking. That the Pukkumerians are the people whose belief constitutes a vestigial Apuku cult seems to me to be a conclusion that cannot help being drawn. However, these objections to Miss Beckwith's interpretations of her data and her explanations of them should not overshadow the value which this book holds for students of the problem of the New World Negro. Her book is a pioneer ethnological account of a New World Negro group, it shows clearly the great amount of African culture that has held over in Jamaica in spite of the oppressions of slavery, and it affords data to help connect the various New World Negro peoples. This is quite enough to ask from any work. It is to be hoped that later students will build on its facts, and be stimulated by its interpretations to further inquiry. MELVILLE J. HERSKOVITS.
