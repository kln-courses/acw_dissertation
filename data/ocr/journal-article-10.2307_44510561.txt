<plain_text><page sequence="1">/Elfric on the creation and fall of the angels MICHAEL FOX TElfric, in the Preface to Genesis , comments about what we do not find in the first book of the Old Testament: 'Seo boc ys gehaten Genesis, paet ys "Gecyndboc", for pam pe heo ys firmest boca and spricp be aelcum gecinde (ac heo ne spricÖ na be paera engla gesceapenisse).'1 Although he proceeds to explain what is contained in the opening verse, noting that creation 'on anngmne' refers at once to the literal act of creation and, 'aefter gastlicum andgite', to Christ through whom all creation was formed, he makes no further comment here upon the angels. In other works, however, where the topic could be more appropriately introduced, TElfric enthusiastically engages with the problem of angelic history. The sermon De initio creaturae , the Interrogationes Sigewulfi , the Exameron , the Letter to Sigeweard and the Letter to Wulfgeat2 all contain accounts of the angelic creation and fall. Because TElfric is a writer 1 That book is called Genesis, that is "the book of origins", because it is the first book and dis- cusses every created thing (although it does not discuss the creation of the angels)' Ģ Elfiic's Prefaces , ed.

Peter Clemoes has observed that, in general, Ailfric's treatments of the crea- tion and fall tend to conform to certain patterns, from the 'creation-fall- redemption-judgement ' pattern of De initio creaturae to the typological relationship between creation and fall and redemption in the Letter to Sigeiveard? Virginia Day has drawn a comparison between the catechetical 'nar ratio' pre- scribed by Augustine's De catecbiņandis rudibus - the 'narrado' should begin with 'an exposition of Christian cosmology and history' - and the 'outline of the whole Christian cycle' which iElfric provides in De initio creaturae .6 To these observations we might add Paul Szarmach's insight about iElfric's 'narrative impulse': 'In the broadest meaning, ALlfric's narrative impulse means his presen- tation of the Bible primarily as story, secondarily as text for analysis. As far as audience effect is concerned, the audience hears primarily narrative as narrative is heard, not, say, a sequence of embedded moral principles.'7 In treating angelic history, iElfric seems to have had each of these goals in mind. Fusing the broad outline of the fall from the Christian tradition with details he finds in various sources, he places his distinctive narrative account of angelic history at the appropriate point in his discussions of creation and then proceeds to establish its relevance to the material which follows. 3 iElfric desired, above all, that the doctrine transmitted in his lucid English prose should be absolutely orthodox and firmly based in the theological tradition' (M. Gatch, Preaching and Theology in Anglo-Saxon England: Mlfric and Wulf stan (Toronto, 1 977), p. 14). iElfric's concern with 'gedwylď has also been well documented. See, for example, M. Godden, 'iElfric and the Vernacular Prose Tradition,&gt; The Old English Homily and its Backgrounds , ed. P. Szarmach and B. Huppé (Albany, NY, 1978), pp. 99-1 17. 4 According to Bede, because the history of this world is intended to be a sermon for the instruc- tion of the human race, Moses makes only brief mention of the 'superior mundus', the history of which pertains more to spiritual and invisible creation. Specifically, when, in the first line of Genesis, God is reported to have made heaven and earth, Moses uses the word 'caelum' to signify all the 'condition and provision of spiritual and invisible creation'. Bede continues: 'Vnde etiam consulte de casu praeuaricatoris angeli et sociorum eius penitus reticuit, quia hoc nimirum ad statum inuisibilis illius ac spiritalis creaturae pertinebať (Übt i quatuor in prìncipium Genesis [hereafter cited in references as In Gen .], ed.

De initio creaturae , which provides iElfric's first and most detailed comment upon the angels, is an attempt to present the most important moments in Christian history, from crea- tion to the Last Judgement. Malcolm Godden calls it 'a preliminary to the more specific discussions in the subsequent sermons' and reiterates that iElfric's essential concern is fall and redemption.8 Beginning with a short explanation of God and the Trinity, iElfric's sermon discusses the creation and fall of the angels, the creation and fall of man, the growth of evil after the fall (which occa- sions a lengthy discussion of idolatry) and the beginning of the line of Eber, including a brief note about the crossing of the Red Sea. New Testament events are treated briefly: from the establishment of the covenant, iElfric moves imme- diately to the Annunciation, the life and betrayal of Christ, and the triumphant return from hell with all the offspring of Adam and Eve. There is reference to the Last Judgement, and the sermon ends with an exhortation to forgo unright- eousness. iElfric's Letter to Wulfgeat and Letter to Sigeweard contain less elaborate versions of the angelic fall. The Letter to Wulfgeat begins with what is best described as a condensed, personalized version of De initio creaturae-. ^Elfric includes a discus- sion of the angels, Adam and Eve, the birth of Christ, the Redemption and the Last Judgment as a preface to a more complicated discussion of Matt. V.25.9 The Letter to Sigeweard, , an introduction to the books of the Old and New Testaments, is mainly an account of the structure of scripture and how we should read it.10 iElfric explains that he offers this work to Sigeweard 'pact pu ealles ne beo minra boca bedaeled':11 with this introduction and scripture, Sigeweard has the fundamental tools of the faith. The work begins much as De initio creaturae , with an explanation of God and the Trinity, a discussion of the angels and a very cursory account of the creation and fall of man, after which Mlfńc launches into his systematic treatment of the books of scripture. Finally, the Interrogationes Sigewulfi and the Exameron are works specifically intended to explicate the book of Genesis. The Exameron is a late work, and it 8 M. Godden, ¿Elfric's Catholic Homilies: Introduction, Commentary and Glossary , EETS ss 18 (Oxford, 2000), pp. 7-8. 9 ťNu wast Öu eall pis, and we wyllaÖ pe secgan sum paera lara, pe se leofa haelend, her on Öysum life lybbende mid mannum, taehte his folgerum, pe him filigdon on life, swa swa he sylf saede on his halgum godspelle: "Esto consentiens aduersario tuo cito, dum es in uia cum ilio, et reliqua" fMatt.V.25r(LlF85-91). 10 For iElfric, this seems to come down to the basic observation that all signs point to Christ: 'And swa forÖ oÖ ende, aelc haiig faeder mid wordum oppe mid weorcum cyddon urne haelend and his faer witodlice' (LSig. 203-7). 11 ťp want you to have this litde book] . . . that you might not be deprived altogether of my books' (LSig. 17-18). 177</page><page sequence="4">Michael Fox has been suggested, on the basis of manuscript evidence, that it was intended to replace De initio creaturae in ZElfric's homily-collections.12 The account of the fall of the angels introduces some new material, but the bulk of the commen- tary is an elaborate explanation of the creation and fall of man. The Exameron , explicating Genesis I- III, is, as its name suggests, a true hexameral commen- tary. The Interrogationes Sigetvulfi, ,13 on the other hand, is an eclectic translation and adaptation of Alcuin's j Quaestiones in Genesím .14 As Clemoes remarks, there is no 'controlling idea' in the Interrogationes to match the patterns and typology of ZElfric's other hexameral works.15 Naturally, the subject matter of ZElfric's Interrogationes is dictated to a large degree by Alcuin's choice of subject matter, but ZElfric's translation is by no means a mechanical rendering into Old English of the Latin original.16 Where Alcuin wrote 281 questions on topics ranging from creation to the blessings of the patriarchs, iElfric includes only sixty-nine questions, the last of which is a discussion of the temptation of Abraham in Gen. XXII.17 12 See F.E.C. Dietrich, ťAbt iElfric, Zur Literatur- Geschichte der angelsächsischen Kirche', Zeitschńft fur die historische Theologie 25 (1855), 487-594; and 26 (1856), 163-256. References in the Exameron (1-3; 106) seem to refer to De initio creaturae and, in turn, much of the Exameron is repeated in De creatore et creatura (ed. Stoneman, 'A Critical Edition', pp. 292-329). 13 The Interrogationes Sigewulfi survives in five manuscripts, described in detail by Stoneman ('A Critical Edition', pp. 1-41), and usually circulated with various homilies and saints' lives. Indeed, the Interrogationes Sigewulfi was part of a three-item addition (including De falsis diis and De XII abusiuis) to the end of iElfric's Lives of Saints [hereafter cited in references as ZJ] in London, British Library, Cotton Julius E.vii. 14 PL 100, cols. 515-66 [hereafter cited in references as /»/.]. On Alcuin's Quaestiones , see M. Fox, Alcuin the Exegete: the Evidence of the Quaestiones in Genesini , in The Study of the Bible in the Carolingian Era , ed. C. Chazelle and B. Edwards (Turnhout, 2003), forthcoming. 15 Clemoes, 'Chronology', p. 225. 16 ALlfric's approach to translation has received a great deal of attention, especially with regard to his Preface to Genesis , which has been related to Jerome's statement on translation: 'Non uerbum e uerbo, sed sensum exprimere de sensu.' See R. Marsden, 'iElfric as Translator: the Old English Prose Genesis ' Anglia 109 (1991), 319-58 at 322-8; Wilcox, Āilftic's Prefaces, pp. 63-5; and H. Minkoff, 'Some Stylistic Consequences of iElfric's Theory of Translation', SP 7 3 (1976), 29-41 and 'An Example of Latin Influence on iElfric's Translation Style', Neophilologus 61 (1977), 127-42. For an interesting introductory discussion of his translation of Alcuin and ZElfric's other hexameral works and their place in the 'English' tradition, see K. O'Keeffe, Three English Writers on Genesis: Some Observations on ¿Elfric's Theological Legacy', Ball State Univ. Forum 19.3 (1978), 69-78. 17 iElfric's translations, on the whole, are faithful to the spirit of his original. The various addi- tions which he makes prove that he had Bede's De natura rerum and In Genesim to hand when translating; it would appear that iElfric also incorporates Augustine's De Genesi contra Manicheos and Isidore's Etymologiae (though evidence for the use of these four works is quite limited). Throughout, TElfric translates freely, adding or removing clauses at will and excising many questions, even before Alcuin's Int. 201. One thing ZElfric does not do, however, is add ques- tions: although he might augment or redirect a response, ALlfric selects his subject matter from Alcuin (excluding the passage on the Trinity with which ZElfric concludes). 178</page><page sequence="5">Aï If rie on the creation and fall of the angels In his conclusion to the Interrogationes, JElińc implies that his primary princi- ple of selection in translating Alcuin has been the utility of the material. After the question on the temptation of Abraham, Mlfńc states suddenly: "Nelle we na swiÕor embe pis spraecan, forpan pe we habbaÕ pa nydbehefestan axunga nu awritene';18 and then he appends a short passage on the Trinity. The question of why these particular queries on material from Gen. I- XXII should have been "most necessary' has several plausible answers. Clemoes draws attention to the fact that iElfric stops translating Alcuin very close to the point at which his translation of Genesis breaks off, and thus postulates that iElfric's vernacular version of the Interrogationes was an attempt to clothe the "bare narrative' of Genesis.19 It may also be significant that the point at which iElfric stops select- ing material from Alcuin's commentary (at Int. 201) coincides with Alcuin's increased dependence on Augustine and Jerome: the character of Alcuin's text changes markedly. Furthermore, iElfric was certainly familiar with Bede's In Genesim , a commentary which traces the Genesis narrative only to the birth of Isaac and the banishment of Ishmael, and he may well have had knowledge of the Old English poem Genesis A, which again treats Gen. I-XXII. Because the structure of the Interrogationes Sigewulfi follows Alcuin's logic and sense of the issues and because iElfric's translation decisions require a different kind of analysis, I consider the creation and fall of the angels in the Interrogationes Sigewulfi separately from iElfric's other works. INTERROGATIONES SIGEWVLFI In his Quaestiones in Genesim , Alcuin devotes three questions to the initial creation of heaven and earth. The first equates "in principio' with Christ; the second, based upon a variant reading of Gen. II.8,20 notes that the creation of paradise can also be located "in principio'; and the third addresses the meaning of "caelum et terram', postulating either that the phrase refers to that unformed matter, created from nothing, which will become heaven and earth, or that 18 We do not wish to speak about this further, because we have now written the most necessary questions' ĢEInt. 69). It is unlikely to be coincidence that iElfric's words evoke the preface to King Alfred's version of Gregory's Regula pastoralis. See King Alfred's West Saxon Version of Gregory's Pastoral Care , ed. H. Sweet, 2 vols., EETS os 45 and 50 (London, 1871-2), 6-8. 19 Clemoes, 'Chronology', p. 225. 20 See Int. 27, quoted below, n. 21 . Alcuin's source is Jerome's Hebraicae quaestiones in Genesim II.8 (ed. P. de Lagarde, CCSL 72 (Turnhout, 1959), 1-56), but Bede makes a similar suggestion {In Gen. 1.1432-5). Although iElfric omits Int. 21, the variant reading of Gen. II.8 - 'Plantauerat autem Dominus Deus paradisum uoluptatis a principio' -which occasions the quotations from Jerome in both Bede and Alcuin, does find its way into iElfric's translation of Genesis. However, instead of using the word ťangin', iElfric there translates 'a principio' as 'fram frymÖe', as if to establish a semantic difference between the uses of the word 'principium' in Gen. 1.1 and Gen. II.8. 179</page><page sequence="6">Michael Fox 'caelum' refers to spiritual creatures and 'terram' to earthly.21 ALlfric reduces these three questions to one: Mint. 22. Hu is to understandenne on anginne gesceop God heofonan and eorpan? J?aet angin is Crist, Godes sunu, swa [swa] he sylf cwaeÖ on his godspelle to pam Iudeiscum, pa pa hi axodon hwaet he waere.

J?urh pact angin, pact is purh pone sunu, gesceop se faeder aerest paet antimber of nahte, of pam pe he syppan heofonan and eorÖan geworhte.22 iElfric's comment on creation 'on anginne' combines material from two of Alcuin's three questions. Specifically, the first phrase of iElfric's answer - 'paet angin is Crist, Godes sunu' - translates the response in Alcuin's Int. 26. The ref- erence to John VIII.25 is iElfric's addition (almost certainly taken from Augustine's De Genesi contra Manicheo, s),23 and the last sentence, in which iElfric mentions [unformed] matter, translates and simplifies the first possibility which Alcuin considers for 'caelum et terram' in Int. 28. iElfric's explanation, then, of the meaning of 'caelum et terram', omits the one statement in the Quaestiones which fixes the moment of angelic creation in the scriptural narra- tive.24 Indeed, various other questions which touch upon the first moments of creation again fail explicitly to address the timing of angelic creation. ALlfric 21 Int. 26: 'Quid est: "In principio creauit Deus caelum et terram"? In filio perfecit [Ms., fecit] Deus caelum et terram'; Int. 27: 'Cur dictum est "plantauerat Deus paradisum a principio"? Hieronymus uult [quod] ante conditionem caeli et terrae paradisum plantatum esset [Edit., esse]'; Int. 28: 'Quid in caeli terraeque nomine significatur, quando dicitur: "In principio fecit Deus caelum et terram?" Informis ilia materia, quam de nihilo fecit Deus, appellata est primo caelum et terra, non quia iam hoc erat, sed quia iam hoc esse poterai. Nam secundo die caelum istud sidereum factum esse legitur, et tertio die terram apparuisse et uestiri floribus coepisse. Siue, in caeli et terrae nomine spirituales et terrenae creaturae intelligi possunt.' 22 Mint. 22: 'How is "In the beginning, God created heaven and earth" [Gen. 1.1] to be under- stood? The beginning is Christ, son of God, just as he himself said in his gospel to the Jews who asked him what he was. He said: "I, who speak to you, am the beginning" [John VIII.25]. Through that beginning, that is, through the son, the father first created matter from nothing, from which [matter] he later wrought heaven and earth.' Ailfric gives a similar explanation in Preface to Genesis 47-54 and EX 47-53. 23 De Genesi contra Maniebeos I.ii.3 (PL 34, cols. 173-220): 'His respondemus, Deum in principio fecisse caelum et terram, non in principio temporis, sed in Christo . . . Dominus enim noster Iesus Christus, cum eum Iudaei interrogassent quis esset, respondit: "Principium, quia et loquor uobis" [John VIII.25].' The passage is similiar in Bede, but Bede has 'interrogantibus se Iudeis quid eum credere deberent' (In Gen. 1.25-8) before the quotation from John. 24 iElfric appears to consider Alcuin's explanation (from Augustine's De Genesi contra Manicheos I.vii.l and I.v.9) for the representation of unformed matter by the words 'caelum et terram' a superfluous and unnecessarily complex detail in a work designed for an unlearned audience. The suggestion that spiritual and earthly creatures may have been indicated, a statement which is predicated upon Alcuin's explanation of how 'caelum et terram' can stand for unformed matter - 'non quia iam hoc erat, sed quia iam hoc esse poterat' (Int. 28) - must then also be excised. 180</page><page sequence="7">Mlfńc on the creation and fall of the angels notes that the following creations were made from nothing: 'Heofan and eorÖ[e], englas and leoht, lyft and waster and pxs mannes saw!',25 and repeats Alcuin's comment about the four modes of divine operation, the second of which consists of the creation of that unformed matter from which all things would be created.26 Though Aīlfric never makes a definitive statement, if the angels, like heaven and earth, are made from nothing, their creation is best located in Gen. 1.1. 27 The logically linked series of questions which Alcuin dedicates to the angelic fall and its relationship to the fall of man (Int. 2-4) are translated without major change. iElfric notes that God created two rational creatures, angels and men, but fails to include Alcuin's remark on their respective dwelling places in heaven and on earth.28 The issue of human and angelic sin is addressed in the following two questions: Mint. 3.

The angels, in the company of God, would have been illuminated by his eternal light, as Bede makes clear (In. Gen. 1.162-6). Temporal light, on the other hand, illuminates the earthly creations of God. See Mint. 24 (Int. 33). 28 Mint. 2: 'Hu fela gesceadwisa gesceafta gesceop God? Twa. Englas and men'; Int. 2: 'Quot crea- turas rationales [Ms., rationabiles] condidit Deus? Duas. Angelos et homines: et caelum angelis, et terram hominibus habitationem.' In the Exameron, iElfric makes a similar comparison: 'Ac he geswutelode his mihta Öurh Öa gesceafta, and wolde Öaet Öa gesceafta gesawon his maerÕa. And hine wurÕodon a on wuldre mid him Öa Öe andgyt habbaÖ, Öaet syndon englas and menn' (42-6). 29 Mint. 3: 'Why was the sin of the angels passed over in silence in the book of Genesis and [the sin] of man revealed?

Instead of retaining Alcuin's two Latin infinitives ('curare' for the angelic wound and 'sanare' for human sin) and repeating the term 'praedestinauit' in Mint 3, iElfric allows the phrase 'wolde . . . gehaelan' to stand for both objects, the order of which, perhaps to give prominent placement to the healing of human sin, he reverses. The most inter- esting change is TElfric's decision to translate both 'peccatum' and 'uulnus' as 'syn', and thus ignore Alcuin's distinction between the act of sinning and its effect. In Mint 4, TElfric translates Alcuin's 'angelus' as 'heahengel' and adds the relative clause epe nu is hetol deofol' in order to avoid potential misunderstand- ing. The final question which iElfric preserves concerning the angels is a combi- nation of Int. 93-4 in the Quaesüones?x Mint. 47. Hwaet is yfel?

Because the high angel, who is now the hostile devil, invented his sin himself, and the man was deceived. And also, as much as the nature of the angel was greater in glory, so was it greater in ruin; as much as the nature of man was weaker, so was it easier to pardon.' Int. 4: 'Cur summi angeli peccatum insanabile fuit et hominis sanabile? [Quia] angelus sui sceleris inuentor fuit; homo uero alterius fraude seductus [fuit]. Item , quanto sublimior angelus in gloria, tanto maior in ruina; homo uero quanto fragilior in natura, tanto facilior ad ueniam.' In 67/1.1 3, Ailfric uses different language to make a similar observation: 'Da peahhwaeÖere ofpuhte pam aelmihtigum Gode ealles manncynnes yrmÖa and smeade hu he mihte his handgeweorc of deofles anwealde alysan; for Öi him ofhreow paes mannes, for Öan pe he waes bepaeht mid paes deofles searocraef- tum; ac him ne ofhreow na paes deofles hryre, for Öan pe he naes purh nare tihtinge forlaered, ac he sylf asmeade pa upahefednysse pe he Õurh ahreas and he for pi a on ecnysse wunaÕ on for- wyrde waelraew deofuT (1 0-1 7) . 31 Int. 93: Wnde euenit diabolo prima [Ms., primo] mala uoluntas?

Having deleted Alcuin's Int. 93, iElfric supple- ments his translation of Int. 94 by explaining that evil has no existence outside of certain creatures and inserting a brief comment on the devil.33 While ALlfric clearly intends his sentence on the devil to replace Alcuin's extended comment on the first evil will, his comment resembles Alcuin's adaptation of Augustine's De ciuitate DePA only in its emphasis on pride as the cause of the angelic defection. The process, in which the devil and his followers avert themselves from God, turn to themselves and seek delight in their own power, is deemed dispensable. In translating the material which deals with the creation of the angels and their subsequent fall, iElfric is largely faithful to Alcuin's text. However, he avoids any reference to the temporal difficulties which inhere in angelic history and the hexameral portion of Genesis.35 ALlfric's omission of Int. 93 is the most significant change: in iElfric's translation of Alcuin, there is no indication - apart from an attribution to pride - of events leading up to the angelic fall. The omission of Alcuin's cursory explanation of the first evil will by no means indi- cates thatiElfric wishes, like Bede, to steer away from discussions of the angelic creation and fall. Rather, as his other accounts of creation demonstrate, iElfric seems to have felt that his audience required a more accessible explanation. DE INITIO CREATVRAE , THE LETTER TO S IGE WE A RD y THE LETTER TO WULFGEAT , AND THE EXAMERON iElfric's narrative accounts of the angelic creation and fall go much farther than the Interrogationes Sigewulfi to reconstruct the history of the angelic fall. Generally, these narrative works agree in the major details. The temporal location of the creation of the angels is either not specified, or is placed simply under the works of the first day. In his Letter to Sigemard, angelic creation is first mentioned to have taken place "on pam forman daege', and later ťon Õam frumsceafte', the latter of which may indicate that the creation of the angels was prior to all other creation.36 The number of angels originally created is Tela pusenda' or 'manega pusenda' and they are divided into ten legions, or orders. Only in his sermons 33 The devil, created good by God, is not evil in nature, but rather made evil by sinning. Hence the use of the word 'wununga' is very appropriate: evil, having been invited in through sin, dwells in a creation for as long as that creation remains unredeemed. 34 Alcuin's Int. 93 is an adaptation of De äuitate Dei XII.6 (ed. B. Dombart and A. Kalb, CCSL 47-8 (Turnhout, 1955)), which is constructed around Sir. X.15: 'Initium peccati omnis super- bia.' 35 That is, not only does iElfric avoid locating the creation of the angels in scriptural time, he also omits Alcuin's Int. 31 , 45 and 46, which treat various issues on the timing and speed of creation. 36 'Se aelmihtiga scippend, Öa Öa he englas gesceop, pa geworhte he purh his wisdom tyn engla werod on pam forman daege on micelre faegernisse, fela pusenda on Öam frumsceafte' (LSig. 51-5). 183</page><page sequence="10">Michael Fox does TElfric enumerate the various orders: 'He gesceop tyn engla werod; paet synt englas and heahenglas, throni, dominationes, principatus, potestates, uir- tutes, cherubim, seraphim.'37 In every account of the creation of the angels, TElfric describes their original condition before he mentions the fallen tenth host, Lucifer, or any rebellion in heaven. The characteristics of the angels vary slightly, but the elements which appear consistently are as follows: the angels are created 'on micelre [or 'wundor- licre' or 'aenlicreļ faegernysse'; they are 'ealle lichamlease', and, therefore, live in, or as, spirits ('on gaste' or 'hi sindon ealle gastas*); and they are very strong ('on miclere strengÕe' or 'swiÕe strange*) or just strong ('strange*). Of TElfric's main works on Genesis, only the Letter to Sigemard mentions light in connection with the original angels (ť[they were] ealle . . . leohte*),38 but both the Letterio Sigemard ('swa wütiges gecindes, swa we secgan ne magon*) and De initio creaturaé (they are simply 'wütige*) contain references to their great beauty. TElfric stresses that the angels were created good39 in order that 'hi mihton geseon Godes maerÕa mid him and mid him wunian on his ecum wuldre'.40 In the Exameron , TElfric adds that the function of angels mirrors the function of men: as a result of their crea- tion with understanding ('andgiť), both angels and men are intended to see the greatness of God and adore him.41 At the moment of their creation, because no evil could be created by God, there was no evil among the angels.42 The differentiating characteristics of Lucifer, when mentioned, always foUow the general description of the angehe host. In the Exameron , TElfric states only that Lucifer was 'wundorücne and faegerne'. In the Letter to Sigemard and De initio creaturae , however, he explains the origin of the name 'Leohtberend': 37 CH 1.1.22-3: ťHe created ten hosts of angels, those are angels and archangels, throni, domina- tiones, principatus, potestates, virtutes, cherubim [and] seraphim.' The tenth host, which fell from heaven, is unnamed. In 67/1.24, ALlfric not only names the nine hosts, but also describes the relative functions of each. There, the fallen tenth host is related to the parable of the lost drachma in Luke XV. 8-9. The material in 67/1.24 comes ultimately from Gregory's Homilia in Euangelia [hereafter cited in references as HEV' XXXIV (PL 76, cols. 1246-59), although Smetana notes that Gregory's homily also appears in the homiliary of Paul the Deacon (C. Smetana, '/Elfric and the Early Medieval Homiliary', Traditio 15 (1959), 163-204, at 190). 38 In the homily De falsis diis , TElfric explains: 'Öeos J? rynny s s gesceop pa scinaendan englas' (Pope XXI.28). 39 Though it is implied, the original beatitude of all the angels is not stated explicitly in the Letter to Wuljgeat. 40 L1F28- 9: ť[The angels were created in order that] they might see the greatness of God among them and dwell with him in his eternal glory.' 41 EX 42-6 (quoted above, n. 28). dElfric likely takes this point from Gregory, who repeatedly mentions the similar functions of angels and men (ťad uidendum Deum', ťad cognoscendum [Deum]', etc.). See TffiKXXXTV. 3 and 6; and Moralia in lob VIII.xviii.34 on Job VII.9-10 ( Moralia in lob , ed. M. Adriaen, 3 vols., CCSL 143- 143B (Turnhout, 1985)). 42 LSig. 61-6: 'Nan yfel Öing naes on Öam englum pa git, ne nan yfel ne com Öurh Godes gescea- pennisse, for Öan Öe he sylf ys eall god and aelc god cimÖ of him.' 184</page><page sequence="11">¿Elfńc on the creation and fall of the angels Gesceawode se an engel pe pxr aenlicost waes, hu faeger he silf waes and hu scinende on wuldre, and cunnode his mihte, paet he mihtig waes gesceapen, and him wel gelicode his wurÖfulniss pa: se hatte 'Lucifer', pxt ys, 'Leohtberenď, for Öaere mielan beorhtnisse his maeran hiwes.43 Somewhere within the six days* iElfric suggests in the Letter to Sigeweard , Lucifer recognized this excellence within himself and then, on the sixth day, the same day on which God created man, Lucifer was turned into an accursed devil and fell from heaven. iElfric describes the process of Lucifer's apostasy in great detail. The accounts in the Letter to Sigeweard , De initio creaturae and the Letter to Wulfgeat , though they vary in length, share similar content. Only the Hexameron differs significandy: it is the instance in which iElfric most explicidy grounds his explanation in the scriptural tradition. In the fuller versions of the angelic fall, contained in the Letter to Sigeweard, , Exameron and De initio creaturae , the fall of the angels, and specifically Lucifer, is preceded by a recognition of his motivation. In each of these accounts, Lucifer's creation as a beautiful and powerful angel (he is, for example, 'aenlicost', 'aenlic', 'faeger' and 'wlitig'), is the inspiration for a choice: having recognized this excel- lence within himself, Lucifer must either embrace his creator gratefully, or turn away and exalt himself against God. In De initio creaturae, iElfric stresses that this choice inheres in the angelic creation: 'God hi gesceop ealle gode, and let hi habban agenne eyre, swa hi heora scyppend lufedon and filidon, swa hi hine forleton.'44 The scriptural verse to which iElfric often alludes in this context is John VIII.44, which he quotes, in both Latin and Old English, in the Exameron' 'He ne wunode na on soÕfaestnysse forÕamÕe seo soÕfaestnyss nis nateshwon45 on 43 LSig. 70-9: ťOne angel, who was the most excellent there, considered himself, how beautiful he himself was and how shining in glory; he recognized his strength, that he was created mighty, and his magnificence pleased him very much: he was called "Lucifer", that is, "Light-bearing", on account of the great brightness of his glorious appearance.' This passage closely resembles Martin of Braga's description of Lucifer's recognition of his created excellence: ťEx quibus unus, qui primus omnium archangelus fiierat factus, uidens se in tanta gloria praefulgentem, non dedit honorem Deo creatori suo' ( Martin von Bracara's Schrift De correctìone rusticorum [hereafter cited in references as De corr. rust.], ed. C. Caspari (Oslo, 1883), c. 3). The account in De initio creaturae is much condensed: 'pa waes paes teoÖan weredes ealdor swiÖe faeger and wlitig gesceapen, swa paet he waes gehaten "Leohtberend" ' (CHU. 29-30). 44 CH 1.1.27-9: 'God created them all good, and let them have control of themselves, so they might love and follow their creator, or they might abandon him.' Interestingly, this choice echoes the process of angelic sin as Alcuin describes it in Int. 93, which ^Elfric chose not to translate. See above, pp. 1 82-3. 45 The adverb 'nateshwon' ('not at all', 'by no means') is Ailfric's addition to John VIII.44. In his Grammar ' 'nates hwon' translates 'hauď ( ¿Elfrics Grammatik und Glossar ' ed. J. Zupitza (Berlin, 1880; repr. Berlin, 1966), p. 226, line 5). 185</page><page sequence="12">Michael Fox him.'46 In TElfric's descriptions of Lucifer's choice, the 'ueritas' which Lucifer abandons becomes almost synonymous with lordship ('hlafordscipe'). In general, Lucifer decides that he does not wish to have God as his lord, and aban- dons God, or 'truth', accordingly. In the Letter to Sigemard , which goes furthest to examine the psychology of Lucifer's decision, TElfric states: Da J?uhte him to huxlic, J?aet he hiran sceolde aenigum hlaforde, pa he swa aenlic waes, and nolde wurÖian pone, pe hine geworhte, and him pancian aefre Öaes pe he him forgeaf and beon him underÖeodd paes Öe swipor geornlice for paere micclan maerÖe pe he hine gemaeÖegode. He nolde pa habban his scippend him to hlaforde, ne he nolde purhwu- nian on Öaere sopfaestnisse Öaes soÖfaestan Godes sunu, pe hine gesceop faegerne . . .47 Rather than motivate him to thank and follow his creator with all eagerness, Lucifer's created excellence causes him to grow proud. Pride (usually 'modig- ness') is associated in each of the three major versions with the elements of the words, attributed to the devil, found in Isaiah XIV. 12-1 5. In the Letter to Sigemard , the attempt to be like God is the one act specifically determined by pride; in the Exameron , which preserves much of the scriptural language, the speech itself is made 'mid dyrstire modignysse'; and, in De initio creaturae , Lucifer speaks only when he has begun 'to modigeanne'.48 Within the narrative explana- tion of the angelic fall, it would appear that the sin of pride is most often evinced by Lucifer's vaunt that he will be better than he was created, like, in fact, to God. However, in general, the angelic fall itself is attributed most often to 'modigness', though 'ofermetto' and 'upahefedness' appear as well. Having associated Lucifer's pride with his vaunts in Isaiah XTV.13- 14,iElfric uses the scriptural verses differently in his treatments of the angelic fall.49 Placing TElfric's uses of the verses into chronological order yields interesting results. By dividing Isaiah XIV. 1 3-1 4 into eight phrases,50 we may devise the fol- lowing table (fig. 6). 46 EX 304-5: 'He did not stand in the truth because truth is not at all in him.' See also the speech of St Vincent in ^Elfric's LIXXXVIL84- 5 (¿Elfric's Lives of Saints: Being a Set of Sermons on Saints' Days formerly observed by the English Churchy ed. W. Skeat, EETS 76, 82, 94 and 114 (London, 1881-1900; repr. as 2 vols., 1966)). 47 LSig. 79-91: Then it seemed to him, when he was so excellent, too shameful that he should obey any lord, and he did not want to honour the one who had created him and to thank him always for that which he had given him and to be subordinate to him, all the more eagerly, on account of the very great glory which he had bestowed upon him. He would not, then, have his creator as his Lord, nor would he remain in the truth of the true son of God, who created him beautiful . . .' 48 In the Letter to Sigemard^ Lucifer's pride becomes, for a time, his defining characteristic: as he searches desperately for a seat in heaven, he is described as 'se modiga'. 49 The following versions of Isaiah XIV.13-14 are £7/1.1.31-3; EX 310-12; LSig. 92-4; ZIF38; and De creatore et creatura 86-8. 50 My divisions are based solely upondïlfric's usage of the scriptural verses. 186</page><page sequence="13">¿Elfric on the creation and fall of the angels Isaiah De initio Exameron Letterio Letterio De creatore et XIV. 13-1 4 creaturae (c. 992-1002) Sigemard Wulfgeat creatura (c. 989) (c. 1005-6) (¿-.1005-6) (¿-.1006) 1.Qui l.cwaeÖon 1. cwaeÖ l.cwaeÖ dicebas in his heortan corde tuo: 2. ťIn caelum conscendam 3. super astra 3. bufan 3. bufan Dei Godes Godes tunglum tunglum 4. exaltabo 2. wolde 2. wolde solium meum wyrcan his wyrcean his cynesed cyneseld 5. sedebo in 3. and sittan monte testamenti 6. in lateribus 4. on Öam 5. on Öam 5. on Öam aquilonis norÖdaele norÖdaele norÖdaele heofonan rices 7. ascendam 4. ofer Öaera 4. ofer Öaera super wolcna wolcna altitudinem heannysse heahnyssae nubium 8. ero similis 2. wolde and 6. and [wolde] 1.

Specifically, JElíác removes 'on his heortan', 'and sittan', 'heofonan rices' and 'and eaÕe mihte' while adding 'bufan Godes tunglum', 'wolde wyrcan his cynesed' and 'ofer Öaera wolcna heannysse'. The desire to be like God - 'ero similis altìssimo' - is transferred from its unusual position as Lucifer's first boast in De initio crea- turae to the close of the boast in the Exameron (although the Exameron still does not adhere strictly to the order of Isaiah). iElfric's preference for the more 187</page><page sequence="14">Michael Fox scripturally grounded version in the Exameron is supported by his use of the later version in De creatore et creatura. Although iElfric incorporates most of the elements of Isaiah XIV. 13- 14 in at least one of his versions of the angelic fall, he omits 'in caelum conscendam' and 'sedebo in monte testamenti'.51 While it could be argued that these omis- sions are coincidental, it seems more likely that iElfric deliberately excised these somewhat obscure remarks. For an unlearned audience, Lucifer's original state- ment would have been puzzling: how would the brightest angel ascend into heaven? Even Jerome, whom Bede quotes in In Genesím with reference to these verses, found it an unresolvable question: Lucifer could have made this speech before, or after, his fall from heaven.52 iElfric, who would have been familiar with Jerome's conclusions through Bede, decides to pass over Lucifer's first boast in silence. SLlińc likely omitted 'sedebo in monte testamenti' for similar reasons. In De initio creaturae , it would seem that iElfric began to translate this portion of the verse, as this is the one occasion on which he uses the verb 'sittan', but then decided to omit the obscure phrase 'in monte testamenti' - a phrase which Jerome explains with reference to Ps. XLVII.3.53 'In corde tuo', as well, which iLlfric initially included, may have been dropped from later versions to avoid confusion concerning the interiority of Lucifer's speech. In De initio creaturae , where the events of Genesis are related with the least reliance on scripture, AElfric may have used the phrase to suggest the inner swelling of pride which is later associated with Eve's decision to heed the serpent.54 Overall, then, the apparent motivation behind iElfric's modifications is to make his account conform more closely to his source in scripture. While composing De initio crea- 51 Mlfńc mentions a throne, Lucifer's 'solium', or 'cynesetl', only in the Exameron and De creatore et creatura. However, as I demonstrate below, the culmination of Lucifer's proud silent boasts in actual conflict brings a curiously literal element into iElfric's conception of the throne as a place to sit. 52 See Bede, In Gen. 1.61-71; Jerome, In Esaiam VI.xiv.13-14 (ed. M. Adriaen, 2 vols., CCSL 73- 73A (Turnhout, 1963)). ALlfric was familiar with the 'heaven of heaven' from Ps. CXLVIII.4-5, which he quotes in the Exameron (157-61) in both Latin and Old English with reference to the firmament and the separation of the waters in Gen. 1.6. 53 Jerome, In Esaiam V.xiv.12-14: "'Sedebo in monte testamenti", id est, in tempio ubi Dei iura sunt condita; "et in lateribus aquilonis", id est, in Hierusalem. Scriptum est enim: "Montes Sion latera aquilonis" [Ps. XLVIII.3].' Alternatively, the mountain may be identified as Mount Zaphon, north of Ugarit, where, according to popular belief, the gods assembled (R. Bratcher, Marginal Notes for the Old Testament (New York, 1 980), p. 1 36). 54 See Alcuin, Int. 66 (not translated by iElfric): 'Quomodo potuit mulier credere serpentis ser- monibus, quod diuinitus a re bona fuisset prohibita? Quia forte ante inerat menti illius amor quidam propriae potestatis, et quaedam de [se] superba praesumptio, quae per illam tentatio- nem fuerat uincenda et humilianda.' Alcuin's source is Bede, In Gen. 1.1946-50, taken in turn from Augustine, De Genesi ad litteram XI.xxx.39 (ed. J. Zycha, CSEL 28.3 (Vienna, 1 894)). 188</page><page sequence="15">¿Elfric on the creation and fall of the angels turae , /Elfric seems to have been less concerned with such details and was perhaps, as I will discuss in more detail below, crafting his words more after an account such as that in Genesis A.55 The one element which occurs in all/Elfric's versions of the angelic fall is 'ero similis altìssimo'. In the Letterio Wulfgeat&amp;wà. the Letter to Sigemard. , in fact, it is the only element of the speech which /Elfric includes. Clearly, he considers Lucifer's claim to be like God, or to usurp God's role, most significant. Lucifer's pride causes him to desire to exchange the lordship of God for his own. In addition to the close translations cited above, /Elfric also transforms the words of Isaiah in other contexts according to his interpretation of the verses. The proud desire to be like God is manifested and summarized by the desire to have power and a kingdom against the will of God, which /Elfric expresses variously: Lucifer ťwolde mid riccetere him rice gewinnan'; ť[wolde] habban anweald and rice ongean Gode aelmihtigum'; and 'wolde beon him sylf on his sylfes anwealde'.56 After Lucifer articulates his intentions, he acts. Though JE lfric's descriptions of the conflict in heaven all emphasize the ease with which the scheming angels are despatched, their fall and their transformation into devils, each account also contains unique detail. In the Letter to Sigemard, , /Elfric explains that Lucifer's next move, after his proud boasts, is to gather companions - '[Lucifer] nam him gegadan ongean Godes willan to his unraede on eornost gefaestnod' - and events then unfold quickly. Through the use of the adverbial conjunction 'pa' (or 'Öa') and the conjunction 'for San Öe',/Elfric concatenates each new development in a manner which suggests both causality and speed: Da naefde he nan seti, hwaer he sittan mihte, for San Se nan heofon nolde hine aberan, ne nan rice naes, pe his mihte beon ongean Godes willan, pe geworhte ealle Sine. Da afunde se modiga, hwilce his mihta waeron, pa pa his fet ne mihton fiirSon ahwar standan, ac he feoll Sa adun to deofle awend, and ealle his gegadan of Sam Godes hirede in to helle wite be heora gewirhtum.57 55 Thus TElfric's 'heofonan rices' and 'and eaSe mihte' of De initio creaturae , also in Genesis A but absent from scripture, are removed for the Exameron. The complete paraphrases in Genesis A read: 'pa he worde cwaeS,/ nipes ofpyrsted, paet he on norSdaele/ ham and heahsed heofena rices/ agan wolde' (31b-34a); and 'Cwaedon paet heo rice, reSemode,/ agan woldan and swa eaSe meahtan' (48-9). All citations of Genesis A are from Genesis A' a New Edition, ed. A. Doane (Madison, WI, 1978) [hereafter cited in references as Gen. A]. 56 LSig. 92-3; £7/1.1.33-4; EX 316. This interpretative substitution may, in fact, be traced to the very words in Int. 93 (from Augustine's De äuitate Dei) which /Elfric omits in his translation of Alcuin. See above, p. 182. 57 LSig. 96-107: Then he had no seat upon which he might sit, because no heaven would bear him, nor was there any kingdom which might be his against the will of God, who created all things. Then the proud one discovered what his powers might be, when his feet could not even stand any longer anywhere, but he fell down, turned into a devil, and all his companions [with him], from the company of God in to the pains of hell on account of their deeds.' 189</page><page sequence="16">Michael Fox In his emphasis on action 'ongean Godes willan', iElfric stresses the efficacy of the will of God: Lucifer has neither seat ('seď) nor kingdom ('rice', which could perhaps also be translated as 'power') and, therefore, he cannot remain in heaven. Only God's will has the power to keep Lucifer aloft: none of the power which he has perceived in himself will avail. The fact that Lucifer's feet can find no purchase is extremely literal, almost comical, and a detail for which I have been able to find no parallel.58 I would suggest that it is intended to emphasize God's omnipotence: the rebel band had no chance from the beginning. Lucifer's first action in the Letter to Sigewearà , to bind ('gefaestnian') the rebel angels to his 'raed' (or 'unraeď), finds parallels in both the Exameron and De initio creaturae ,59 Because De initio creaturae uniquely mentions Lucifer's lordship over a tenth host of angels, iElfric confirms several times that their 'raed' is binding and unanimous before God acts: ļ?a gefaestnode he [Lucifer] pisne raed wiÖ Öam werode pe he bewiste, and hi ealle to Öam raede gebugon; pa Öa hi ealle haefdon pisne raed betwux him gefaestnod, pa becom Godes grama60 ofer him eallum, and hi ealle wurdon awende of Öam faegeran hiwe pe hi on gescapene waeron to laÕlicum deoflum.61 The Exameron mentions his accomplices and their agreement only at the moment at which they fall, but begins by observing that Lucifer 'naefde . . . nane faestnunge'.62 The placement of this remark and its structural similarities to the Letterio Sigemard (quoted above) equates the words 'seti' and 'faestnung', and the language of all three accounts suggests that iElfric is employing an interesting 58 The translation included in Crawford's edition (by William L'isle) pretends that the line does not exist: Then perceived this proud one what his power was: sith hee had no place to rest on; but fell downe, into devili turned with all his complices, from the court of God to the paines of hell, as they deserved [sic]' (20). 59 Day suggests that iElfric's source may be Martin of Braga's De correctione rusticorum , a work which iElfric certainly knew, as he quotes it in his homily De falsis dits (Pope XXI). Martin twice mentions the angels who were plotting with Satan - 'qui illi consenserunť and ťilli alii angeli, qui consentientes illi fuerunť {De corr. rust . c. 3). Day also notes that Pirmin's Scarapsus (Die Hiemat des hl. Pirmin des Apostels der Alamannen , ed. G. Jecker, Beiträge zur Geschichte des alten Mönchtums und des Benediktinerordens 13 (Münster, 1927)) preserves much of Martin's account of the angelic creation and fall (V. Day, The Fall of the Angels in Old English Literature' (unpubl. PhD dissertation, Cambridge Univ., 1974), p. 98). Ambrosius Autpertus's InApocalypsin (ed. R. Weber, 2 vols., CCCM 21- 21 A (Turnhout, 1975)) contains a similar detail - 'angelorum legiones sibi consentientes' {InApocalypsin II.ii.24a, lines 14-30). 60 This anthropomorphic description of God's reaction in this context is unusual: I have been able to find no source or parallel outside Old English biblical verse. Compare, for example, Gen. A 60b-63a. However, iElfric often uses the phrase 'Godes grama'. 61 CHIA .34- 8: Then he fixed that counsel with the host which he governed, and they all bent to that counsel. Then when they had all fixed that counsel between them, then God's wrath came over them all, and they all were changed from that fair appearance, in which they were created, to loathsome devils.' 62 EX 311. 190</page><page sequence="17">66 CHIA .42-5: And pa hwile pe he smeade hu he mihte daelan rice wi8 god, pa hwile gearcode se aelmihtiga scyppend him and his geferan hellewite, and hi ealle adraefde of heofonan rices myrihÖe, and let befeallan on Öaet ece fyr, pe him gegearcod waes for heora ofermettum [cf. Matt.XXV.411/ ¿E lfric on the creation and fall of the angels metaphor throughout: instead of binding himself to God, Lucifer chooses to seek a ťseať or 'security' in his own power. The angels of the tenth host make the same mistake, bending to Lucifer's plan (the 'raed' which would seem to repre- sent Lucifer's vaunts in Isaiah XIV. 13- 14) and then neither Lucifer nor his host have any power by which they might retain a kingdom in heaven. As TElfric puts it in his Letter to Wulfgeat 'Da ne mihte he wunian on paere micclan maerÖe, ne eac his gegadan, butan Godes mihte, ac wurdon pa asyndrode fram pam soÕum Gode, forpam Õe hi forleton his hlafordscipe.'63 That is, without the tie to God, and without any overt action by God, except perhaps a withdrawal of his power, the apostate angels simply plummet from heaven into the punishments of hell.64 TElfric's conception of the chronology of these events is inconsistent. The change of form, from angel to devil, can either precede or follow the fall from heaven.65 In De initio creaturae , JE lfric interposes a short interval between the transformation to devils and the consignment to hell: while Lucifer thinks des- perately how he might wrestle a kingdom from his creator, God calmly prepares hell.66 The speed and ineluctability of the fall, however, which are demonstrated by TElfric's unique use of language (as detailed above), are confirmed by the scriptural verse with which TElfric closes his account in the Exameron : 'Be Sam cwaeS se haciend her on Sysum life: "Ic geseah Sone sceoccan swa swa scinende liget feallende adun dreorig of heofonum"; forSamSe ahréas ungerydelice.' As if falling like lightning were not sufficient, TElfric adds the word 'dreorig' (or 'bloody*) to the biblical version and explains the verse: Lucifer fell violently.67 63 LW 39-42: Then he [Lucifer] might not dwell in that great glory, nor also his companions, without God's power, but they were then cut off from the true God because they all abandoned his lordship.' 64 In De initio creaturae , JE lfric states the God 'let befeallan' the rebel angels (67/1.1.44, quoted in full n. 66, below). 65 The devil, however, is not one of God's creations: ťNu pencÔ maenig man and smeaÔ hwanon deoful come; ponne wite he pact God gesceop to m aeran engle pone pe nu is deofiil, ac god ne sceop hiñe na to deofle, ac pa 8a he waes mid ealle fordon and forscyldgod purh 8a mielan upahefednysse and wiÖerweardnysse, pa wear8 he to deofle awend, se 8e aer waes maere engel geworhť (67/1.1.56-61). This rhetorical question on the origin of the devil echoes passages in Augustine: see De Genesi contra Manicheos II.xxviii.42 and Tractatus in Iohannis euangelium CXXIV XLII.x.33- 6 (ed. A. Mayer, CCSL 36 (Turnhout, 1954)). Godden Ģ Elfric's Catholic Homilies , p. 9) points out that the latter appears also in Haymo's Homilia XXXII (PL 118, col. 216). 67 EX 320-3: About that the Lord said here in this life: "I saw that devil just like shining lightning, falling down bloody from heaven" [Luke X.18]; because he fell violendy.' The Vulgate version of Luke X.18 reads: 'Videbam Satanan sicut fulgur de cáelo cadentem'; the Old English reads: 'Ic geseah Satanan swa swa ligraesc [variant in Cambridge, University Library Ii.2.11: 'liget raescť] of heofone feallende' ( The Old English Version of the Gospels , ed. R. Liuzza, EETS os 304 191</page><page sequence="18">Michael Fox The eternai state of the fallen angels is given only minimal consideration.68 Satan and his cohorts are in ťhell-punishmenť, suffering the torment of eternal fire.69 Interestingly, iElfric also points out that the rebel angels become worse than any other creation: 'J?a wearÕ he and ealle his geferan forcupran and wyrsan ponne aenig oÖer gesceaft.'70 In addition, the Letter to Wulfgeat , in a passage which dälfric adapts from Alcuin's QuaesHones , briefly examines the internal disposition of the fallen angels: '[Cut off from God, the fallen angels are] mid andan afyllede and mid orwennysse aelcere miltsunge, manfulle gastas.'71 Though every evil perpetrated in the world can be attributed to the apostate angels,72 TElfric stresses that they have very little power unless a man is willing to bend to their teaching: Nu cwaedon gedwolmen paet deofol gesceope sume gesceafta, ac hi leogaÖ; Ne maeg he nane gesceafta gescyppan, for Öan Öe he nis na scyppend, ac is atelic sceocca, ac mid lea- sunge he wile beswican and fordon pone unwaran; ac he ne maeg naenne man to nanum leahtre geneadian, buton se mon his agenes willes to his lare gebuge.73 (Oxford, 1994)). I choose to translate 'dreorig' as 'bloody' rather than 'sorrowful', based on the devil's recent defeat in heaven and /Elfric's qualification of Luke X.1 8, he 'ahreas ungerydelice'. For a parallel use, see the passage preceding the finding of ALschere's head in Beowulf. Waeter under stod/ dreorig ond gedrefed' Ç Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, ed. F. Klaeber, 3rd ed. (Boston, 1950), 1416b-1417a). For another attribution of corporeal characteristics to the devil, recall the devil's feet in the Letterio Sigeweard. 68 The remaining nine orders of angels are confirmed in heaven and can no longer sin: 'pa sona pa nigon werod pe Öaer to lafe wseron bugon to heora scyppende mid ealre eaÖmodnysse and betaehton heora raed to his willan; Da getrymde se aelmihtiga God pa nigon engla werod and gestaÖolfaeste swa paet hi naefre ne mihton ne noldon syÖÖan fram his willan gebugan ne hi ne magon nu ne hi nellaÖ nane synne gewyrcan; Ac hi aefre beoÖ ymbe paet an hu hi magon Gode gehyrsumian and him gecweman' (CH 1.1.45-51). See also De creatore et creatura 107-12. 69 The scriptural source for the nature of the suffering of the angels (though the change of form from angel to devil is not mentioned) is Matt. XXV.41: 'Discedite a me, maledicti, in ignem aeternum, qui paratus est diabolo et angelis eius.' 70 £7/1.1.41-2: Then he [Lucifer] and all his companions became more wicked and worse than any other creation.' 71 LWAA-5: '[Cut off from God, the fallen angels are] filled with envy and despair of any pardon, evil spirits.' See Int. 13; Mint. 10. 72 L1F46-9: 'And aelc paera yfela, 6e oÖ Öis becom, eall hit gewyrÕ aefre purh pa awyrgedan gastas and purh pa yfelan menn, pe hi magon forlaeran to Sam yfelan willan, pe hi on wuniaS.' ALlfric also associates the gods of heathen men with the fallen angels. See De falsis diis (Pope XXI.658- 63), a passage which appears to be taken from Martin's De corr. rust. c. 7. 73 CHI. 1.11 7-22: 'Now heretics say that the devil created some creatures, but they lie; he may not create any creatures, because he is no creator, but is a loathsome fiend, and with lying he will deceive and destroy the unwary; but he may not compel any man to any crime, unless the man, through his own will, bends to his teaching.' 192</page><page sequence="19">Mlfrìc on the creation and fall of the angels BACKGROUND AND SOURCES iElfric's treatments of the angelic creation and fall are remarkable for both their form and content. When authorities such as Augustine, Gregory, Bede and Alcuin probe the question of the angels, they avoid formulating a narrative. In other words, they are primarily concerned with exegesis and analysis. iElfric, on the other hand, beginning with De initio creaturae , constructs an elaborate narra- tive which, though grounded in various verses of scripture, is based only loosely upon hexameral exegesis. Both the Letter to Sigeweard and the Letter to Wulfgeat are also narrative accounts, but both seem to assume some knowledge of the scrip- tural background. Of the four main accounts which I have considered, the Exameron is the least inventive, as it presents the scriptural evidence with little embellishment. Although I have indicated possible sources throughout, iElfric's treatments seem to me to be without direct source. After an exhaustive study of the history of the fall of the angels, Virginia Day has concluded: 'No exact sources have been discovered for ALlfric's four main accounts of the fall of the angels, and it seems to me possible that none existed.'74 Still, iElfric's main source is clearly scripture. iElfric constructs his comments around several different scriptural verses which he quotes - John VIII.44, Luke X.l 8 and, most importantly, Isaiah XIV. 12-1 5. Other passages from scripture, though he does not quote them, appear also to have influenced iElfric. Luke XV.8- 9 and the parable of the lost drachma provide a backdrop against which to set an explanation of the function of each of the nine different angelic hosts;75 Apoc. XII.9 confirms the violent expulsion of Satan and his followers from heaven;76 and Ezekiel XXVIII. 12-1 7 appears to be the ultimate source for the notion that Lucifer was pre-eminent among the angels in heaven.77 74 Day, "The FalT, pp. 131-2. Day's thesis provides an excellent summary of the history of the fall of the angels. See also J. Evans, Paradise Lost and the Genesis Tradition (Oxford, 1968), and, for a summary particularly relevant to Old English, D.Johnson, The Fall of Lucifer in Genesis A and Two Anglo-Latin Royal Charters', JEGP 97 (1998), 500-21, esp. 500-12. 75 See also Col. 1.16 and Eph. 1.21 . 76 ťEt proiectus est draco ille magnus serpens antiquus qui uocatur diabolus et Satanas, qui seducit uniuersum orbem: proiectus est in terram et angeli eius cum ilio missi sunt' (Apoc. XII.9). The term 'diabolus' translates the Greek form meaning 'slanderer' or 'accuser'; the name 'Satan' translates the Hebrew form, meaning 'adversary' or 'opponent' (R. Bratcher, A Translator's Guide to the Revelation of John (New York, 1 984), p. 100). 77 The verses in Ezekiel are too lengthy to quote in full, but they include references to the devil's boast that he is a god, his perfect beauty fperfectus decore') and subsequent pride ('eleuatum est cor tuum in decore tuo') and his supremacy over the nine orders of angels (symbolized by the precious stones in Eden). 193</page><page sequence="20">Michael Fox The application of these verses to angelic history has a long tradition in exe- gesis.78 At least as early as the time of Origen's De pńncipiis (written ante 231), the verses in Isaiah and Ezekiel were being taken to apply figuratively to the devil.79 Augustine, too, cites many of these verses in his explication of Genesis. John VTII.44 is pivotal in Augustine's determination of Lucifer's original status in heaven and, by extension, in Augustine's arguments about the origin of evil.80 In addition, in consecutive chapters of De Genesi ad litteram, Augustine cites the pas- sages in Isaiah and Ezekiel with reference to the devil. Augustine, however, rather than applying them to the sequence of events in heaven, explains both as references to the body of the devil, those recruits from the human race who have thrown in their lot with evil.81 Neither passage is cited or alluded to within his explanation of the angelic fall. Although Augustine refers to the different angelic orders in many works, he does not compile a complete list of the nine orders, nor does he address the various functions of each order. In fact, the most important comment which Augustine makes on this issue reveals a fundamental unwillingness to speculate on this particular aspect of angelology: ťQuomodo autem se habeat beatissima illa et superna societas, quae ibi sint differentiae praepositurarum . . . dicant qui possunt, si tarnen possunt probare quod dicunt. Ego me ista ignorare confit- eor.'82 Gregory the Great, however, with reference mainly to the passages in 78 The precise influence of the earliest attempts to elucidate and supplement Gen. I- III in the Jewish and Jewish-Christian pseudepigrapha is difficult to establish. Works such as I Enoch (also known as the Book of Enoch or the Ethiopie Enoch) and II Enoch (also known as the Book of the Secrets of Enoch or the Slavonic Enoch), the Book of fubilees and the VitaAdae et Euae all attempt to redress the narrative shortcomings of the book of Genesis (see J. Charlesworth, The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, I (Garden City, NY, 1983)). In these accounts, however, no firm con- sensus emerges about the timing and circumstances of angelic and human sin. In fact, the fall of the angels is often located in Gen. VI. 1-4 (see I Enoch and the Book of fubilees ): angels, inspired by the beauty of earthly women, descend, take wives and breed horrible giants, all the while dispensing different types of arcane knowledge to men and women. Thus, the origin of evil in the world is traced not to the sin of Adam and Eve, but rather to the sins of the angels: the collocation of the acquisition of knowledge and the spread of lawlessness and evil prob- ably influences later interpretations of the temptation. II Enoch (about which Charlesworth says: ťIn every respect II Enoch remains an enigma' ( The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, p. 97)), in placing creation and fall of the angels on the second day, shows the clear influence of Isaiah XIV. 12-1 5 (II Enoch XXIX.3-5). Origen points out that it is impossible that the passage in Ezekiel, especially, could refer to a man. See On First Principles, trans. G. Butterworth (London, 1936), V.4- 5. 80 See, for example, De Genesi ad litteram XI.xvi.21 and De ciuitate DeiXl.ì 3. 81 Both passages, Augustine remarks, function 'in figura'. See De Genesi ad litteram XI.xxiv.31-XI.xxv.32. 82 Enchiridion ad Laurentium de fide et spe et caritate XV. 58 (ed. E. Evans, CCSL 46 (Turnhout, 1 969), pp. 21-114): 'How that high and most blessed society might keep itself, and what the differ- ences of the orders might be . . . let those say who are able, if, however, they are able to prove what they say. I confess myself to be ignorant of these things.' 194</page><page sequence="21">JElfńc on the creation and fall of the angels Isaiah and Ezekiel, explores the history of the angels in great depth. In fact, Gregory's homily for the third Sunday after Pentecost (HEVXXXIV) becomes the 'locus classicus' for later exegetes and homilists interested in angelology. Gregory also contrasts and compares the respective histories of angels and men, noting that both are created subject to God, either 'ad uidendum Deum' or 'ad cognoscendum [Deum]', and this remark seems to have inspired iElfric's comments on the function of the angels.83 Gregory relates the nine orders of angels both to the parable of the lost drachma in Luke XV. 8-9 and to the nine precious stones of Ezekiel XXVIII. 13, establishing Lucifer's pre-eminence on the basis of the latter: 'Quibus nimirum ordinibus ille primus angelus ideo ornatus et opertus exstitit, quia dum cunctis agminibus angelorum praelatus est, ex eorum comparatione clarior fuit.'84 After mentioning the strength of Michael in relation to Isaiah XIV. 13- 14 and Apoc. XII.7, Gregory enumerates the specific functions of each of the nine orders of angels, and it is this explanation which becomes the source of iElfric's account in CH 1.24. For Gregory, the creation of man is God's solution to the problem of the empty seats in heaven.85 In the Moralia , Gregory makes frequent reference to angelic events, usually within the context of Isaiah and Ezekiel. Gregory again applies the nine stones to the nine subordinate orders of angels, stating that Lucifer was 'reliquis angelis eminentior', 'magnus sine comparatione', and that 'quorum dum claritatem transcenderei, ex eorum comparatione clarior fuit'.86 The devil's boast in Isaiah then becomes the focus of Gregory's explanation of the angelic fall. After 83 See HEVXXX IV.3 and 6; and Moralia VHI.xviii.34 on Job VII.9- 10. Another interesting pos- sibility, and a work which certainly influenced Alcuin's Int. 3-4, is the Irish Augustine's De mira- bilibus sacrae scńpturae (PL 35, cols. 2149-200). The Irish Augustine seems to be the source of the idea that angelic sin is passed over in silence because it is not destined to be restored: Angelicum uero uulnus uerus medicus qualiter factum sit, indicare noluit, dum illud postea curare non destinauit. Et qualiter sit eiectus per sententiam uindictae, reticuit, quern per poeni- tentiam nullo modo reuocauit. Peccatum uero hominis, quomodo factum fuerit, profertur: ipsum namque quandoque promereri ueniam non desperatur. Et qualiter eiectus sit homo, indicare Deus maluit, quem ad statum pristinum in nouissimo iterum reuocauiť {De mirabilibus 1.2). See also Gregory, Moralia IV.iii.8 and XXXI.i.l and Augustine, Tractatus in Iohannis euange- liumCX.l. 84 HE V XXXIV. 7: 'Certainly, the first angel stood adorned and covered with the nine orders, since, when he was placed before the entire host of angels, in comparison to them, he was more distinguished.' 85 HEVXXXJM. 6. The idea was made popular by Augustine (see De ciuitate Dei XXII.l and Enchirìdion IX.29). For the development of the 'doctrine of replacement', see Dorothy Haines, Vacancies in Heaven: the Doctrine of Replacement and Genesis A' Notes and Queries n.s. 44 (1997), 150-4. 86 Moralia XXXII.xxiii.47- 8 on Job XL.14: '[Lucifer was] more eminent than the remaining angels'; 'great beyond comparison'; and 'while he transcended the brightness of the others, he was, in comparison to them, more distinguished'. 195</page><page sequence="22">Michael Fox quoting Isaiah XIV. 13 - 1 4, Gregory states: 'Solus quippe altissimus ita domina- tur super omnia, ut alteri subesse non possit. Quem diabolus imitari peruerse uoluit, cum suum dominium quaerens, ei subesse recusauit.'87 Furthermore, the fall of Lucifer, who wishes in his pride to be like God, is a model for the fall of man, who believes the serpent's claim that eating the fruit will confer divinity upon him.88 As Lucifer becomes a devil through his desire to be more than the other angels, so man becomes like an apostate angel when he disdains to be like his fellow men.89 Although Gregory's outline of angelic events, and especially his HEV XXXIV, were likely the strongest influences upon iElfric, it is possible that iElfric obtained some of his knowledge of Gregory through later sources. Isidore, for example, twice treats the issue at length. In the Etymologiae , he dis- cusses the naming of the various orders as well as their functions; and, in the Sententìae , Isidore offers a fairly full account of both the creation and fall of the angels.90 In addition, Gregory's HE V XXXIV was used by Paul the Deacon (720-P99) in compiling his eighth-century homiliary, and Smetana has shown that iElfric often consulted Paul's work.91 Ultimately, however, some elements of ^Elfric's account must be adopted directly from Gregory.92 Another early source with which ZElfric was familiar is the treatise De correc- tions rusńcorum by Martin of Braga (515-80), a work which Day has connected with the catechetical 'narratio' and has suggested, very plausibly, as a possible inspiration for iElfric's De initio creaturaeP Martin's work begins with the crea- tion of heaven and earth and explains the original condition and fall of the angels in some detail. Martin's account of angelic history, though it is not grounded in the vocabulary of scripture, is closer in style and content to iElfric 87 Moralia XXIX.vii.15 on Job XXXVIII. 15: The most high alone rules over all things in such a way that he is unable to be subject to another.

Gneuss includes seven manuscripts, three of which (though fragmentary) may date from the late eighth century, in his handlist. See H. Gneuss, Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts (Tempe, AZ, 2001), nos. 42, 242, 255, 566, 733, 767 and 804.5. For detailed information on the early English manuscript tradition, see T.

Interestingly, neither Bede nor Alcuin discuss the angelic orders, and their treatment of angelic history is limited. Bede claims that angelic history is a topic best omitted in a 'sermon for the instruction of the human race'.95 Though he adopts much of Gregory's /ffiKXXXIV in his commentary on Luke, his bor- rowing breaks off at precisely the point at which Gregory introduces the nine orders of angels.96 Alcuin, on the other hand, gives the angelic creation and fall passing treatment in his Quaestiones?1 In a letter to Gallicellulus on the numbers one to ten in scripture, Alcuin also makes a brief comment on the angelic orders: 'Nouem lapidibus opertus est archangelus, qui cecidit de cáelo. Nouem ordinēs angelorum remanserunt in caelo.'98 There are interesting Gregorian pas- sages in both Ambrosius Autpertus and Paschasius Radbertus, but there is no way of determining their possible influence on iElfric." Among the later Carolingians, Haymo's Homilia de tempore CXIV100 is closest to Gregory's angel- ology, but does not preserve many of the details which we find iniElfric. After scripture, then, the primary influence on iElfric's conception of angelic events is probably Gregory: iElfric would have seen the significant scriptural verses used by Gregory (except perhaps John VIII.44, which may have come via Augustine) and then, using those verses as his authority, he constructed a con- vincing narrative sequence of events. In the process, he may have been influ- enced by specific comments from other writers (most importandy, it would seem, by Gregory and Martin of Braga) and I believe we should not exclude the possibility thatiElfric's conception of the angelic fall, especially in De initio crea- turae , was modelled to some extent on that in the Old English poem Genesis A' it is surprising, indeed, and perhaps significant, that the work closest to iElfric should be the poetic paraphrase of Genesis contained in Junius 11. 94 See Martin, De corr. rust. c. 3, portions of which I have quoted above. 95 See above, p. 176, n. 4. 96 Bede quotes /ffiKXXXIV.1-6 frequently before In Lucam IV.2263 (ed. D. Hurst, CCSL 120 [1960], pp. 1-425), and Bede next quotes HEVXKXIV.i 5-1 6 (InLucamïV.2264-76). 97 See above, pp. 179- 83. 98 The archangel, who fell from heaven, was adorned with nine stones. Nine orders of angels remained in heaven' {Epistolae Karolini Aevi II, ed. E. Dümmler, MGH Epist. 4 (Berlin, 1895), no. 81). Perhaps significantly, this letter was one of four which circulated with an early Edition' of Alcuin's Quae shone s . 99 See, for example, Ambrosius Autpertus, In Apocalypsin II.ii.24a and III. v. lb, the latter of which, an adaptation of a passage in Augustine's Contra Faustum XXII.87 (ed.

Paulus, CCCM 56-56B (Turnhout, 1984)). 100 PL 118, cols. 609-15. 197</page><page sequence="24">Michael Fox Setting aside the fact that the very inclusion of material relating to the angelic creation and fall as a preface to a discussion (or metrical paraphrase) of Genesis is unusual enough to elicit comment, there are at least four correspondences in detail between TElfric's De initio creaturae and Genesis A which should be men- tioned: (1) the use of Isaiah XIV.12-15 (CHU 31-4; Gen . A 31b-34a); (2) the delay while God creates hell (67/ 1.1. 42- 4; Gen. A 34b-46b); (3) the use of the phrases ťea0e mihte' and 'eaÖe meahtan' in the context of the boast (67/1.1.32; Gen . A 47a-48b); and (4) the anthropomorphized, angry God (67/1.1.36-7; Gen. A 60b-63a).101 That both TElfric and the Genesis A poet should turn to the words of Isaiah is interesting, but, for reasons outlined above, hardly striking.102 The three other details, however, are intriguing. The delay while God creates hell is a highly unusual detail, and one for which I have been able to find no other source. Equally significant is the use of the adverb ťea0e' in the context of the boast, though, admittedly, in Genesis A, it does not occur within the main para- phrase of Isaiah. The presentation of God's anger contains no verbal parallels, but is again, in the context of the fall of the angels, a detail for which I have been able to find no other source. David Johnson has recently suggested, on the basis of similar presentations of the fall of the angels, that there may be some connection between two Winchester charters and Genesis A, and, ultimately, between Winchester itself and the manu- script Junius ll.103/Elfric, born c. 955, around the beginning of the reformation of the English monastic houses, was influenced most by /Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester (963-84), under whom he studied in the cathedral school.104 Between 987 and 990, /Elfheah, /Ethelwolďs successor, sent/Elfric to the minster church at Cerne, where /Elfric became 'munuc and maessepreosť.105 Thus, it was probably 101 A detailed comparison of ALlfric's De initio creaturae (and other sermons containing material from Genesis) and Genesis A is beyond the scope of this article: these similarities are simply the most suggestive in passages relating to the fall of the angels. For parallels in the 'doctrine of replacement', see Haines, 'Vacancies', pp. 152-4. 102 The focus of Genesis A is not, as in Ailfric, upon the desire to be like God, but rather upon the martial struggle: Lucifer attempts to establish an alternative kingdom in heaven. Thus, the Genesis A poet omits 'ero similis altissimo' in his paraphrase of the verses. However, both De initio creaturae and Genesis A point out that Lucifer intends to sit in the northern regions of the kingdom of heaven, adding lieofonan rices' and 'heofena rices', respectively, to their transla- tion of 'in lateribus aquilonis'. 103 Johnson, The Fall of Lucifer', p. 503, n. 10. 104 TElfric calls himself an 'alumnus Adelwoldi' (67/ 1, preface, line 3); 'Wintoniensis alumnus' ( Vita S. Mthelmldi , c. 1, in Wulf stan of Winchester: the Ufe of St ¿Ethehvold, ed. M. Lapidge and M. Winterbottom (Oxford, 1991), pp. 70-80); and notes that he learned 'in scola ALÕelwoldi' (Zupitza, Grammatik. , p. 1). Though we do not know when TElfric entered the school at Winchester, he reports that he lived in/Ethelwold's school 'multis annis' and/Ethelwold died in 984 ĢElfric's Letter to the Monks of Eynsham , ed. C. Jones, CS ASE 24 (Cambridge, 1998), c. 1). 105 iElfric himself reports the move: 'Ic ALlfric munuc and maessepreost, swa Öeah waccre ponne 198</page><page sequence="25">JElfiic on the creation and fall of the angels not long after his departure from Winchester that TElfric composed De initio crea- turae. Although Johnson's conclusions are tentative,106 the addition of these inter- esting parallels between iElfric and Genesis A would suggest that the possibility of a Winchester connection for Genesis A and, by extension, Junius 11, should be taken seriously. CONCLUSIONS Despite the fact that scripture says very litde about the angels, angelic history has an important place in medieval Christian cosmology. From the earliest inter- pretations of Genesis, which were often mainly attempts to supplement the terse account of creation in Gen. I- III, the history of the angels has been con- stantly written and rewritten. Why were these peripheral characters the subject of so much speculation? To put it briefly, angelic sin was the first sin and, there- fore, the model for all sin and the source of worldly evil. In fact, the fall of the angels was often seen as the event which precipitated the creation of man and the physical world. When coupled with the creation and fall of man, we essen- tially have an explanation of the 'human condition'.107 In the education and spiritual guidance of both clergy and laymen, therefore, the foundations of world history would obviously have been of paramount importance. 'In general', Day concludes, 'TElfric's production of several versions of the "narrado" - as well as his use of similar material in the Exameron - has the aim of providing a framework for the unlettered, of placing each particular point of Christian doctrine in the relation to the pattern of the whole.'108 Indeed, if this is the case, such an aim is consonant with iElfric's swilcum hadum gebyrige, wearÖ asend on ALpelredes daege cyninges fram Ailfeage biscope, AÖelwoldes aeftergengan, to sumum mynstre Öe is Cernei gehaten, purh AiÖelmseres bene Öaes pegenes, his gebyrd and goodnys sind gehwaer cupe' (67/ 1, preface, lines 44-8). 106 Johnson cautions that the evidence he offers does not, on its own, 'suffice to determine when and where the manuscript was written', but affirms that his findings are 'suggestive and worthy of further consideration' (The Fall of Lucifer', p. 503, n. 10). 107 Johnson comments: 'An account of creation is not simply an exercise in theological learning; it is also implicitly an account of the human condition' (The Fall of Lucifer', p. 516). Alcuin, for example, eloquently explains how the obscure events of creation define the struggle for life on earth, as signified by the seed of woman and the seed of the serpent in Gen. III. 15: 'Semen mulieris est totum genus humanuni; semen serpentis, originalis peccati primordium: quae duo semina ex praecepto diuino continuum inter se odium gerere debent, ut non faciamus quae diabolus uult, quia ¿lie numquam uult nobis profutura' {Int. 76). See also Augustine, De Genesi contra Manicheos II.xviii.28. 108 Day, 'Influence', p. 59. 0'Keeffe suggests that /Elfric's various exegetical methods with regard to Genesis may be explained by the different audiences for whom he was writing: 'TElfric's four works [67/1.1, De temporibus anni , Interrogaüones Sigewulfi and the j Exameron] of exposition treat- ing Genesis vary in content according to genre (sermon or treatise) and intended audience (clerical or lay)' (O'Keeffe, Three English Writers', p. 72). 199</page><page sequence="26">Michael Fox overall plan, to provide England with 'a summary of Carolingian - and English - religious learning'.109 As I have shown, however, TElfric's treatments of the fall of the angels differ significantly from those of the authorities with which he is known to have been familiar. These differences are perhaps best explained by TElfric's desire to emphasize the cyclical nature of Christian history,110 his tendency to present scripture primarily as narrative and the relatively unlearned audiences for whom he is writing. Seeing the fundamental importance of creation and finding no exacdy appropriate account of angelic history elsewhere, TElfric turned first to the authority of scripture. With such an unassailable foundation, he was able to compose accounts which could satisfy his various needs. As his career pro- gressed, TElfric seems to have felt the need for scriptural authority more strongly, and thus we see major differences between De initio creaturae and the Exameron. Whatever his sources, TElfric's accounts are unique, scripturally grounded and compelling explanations of the angelic creation and fall. In his fullest work, De initio creaturae , he demonstrates how the issue of obedi- ence and disobedience is central to Christianity,111 while at the same time neatly connecting the first sin with the fall of man and the redemption: Lucifer falls and Adam and Eve fall; Christ defeats Lucifer and Adam and Eve are released from hell. All of Christian history is effectively condensed into one simple observa- tion: And he ponne pa manfiillan deofle betaecÖ into Sam ecan fyre hellesusle; pa rihtwisan he laet mid him into heofonan rice, on Sam hi rixiaS a on ecnysse.'112 The basic tenet, then, which informs TElfric's treatments of the angels (and, by extension, much of his exegetical writing) may be summarized by his comment at the beginning of the Letter to Sigemará '. . . hit ys swiSe wolic paet Sa geworhtan gesceafta pam ne beon gehirsume pe hi gesceop and geworhte'.113 109 P. Clemoes, 'iElfric', Continuations and Beginnings: Studies in Old English Literature , ed. E. Stanley (London, 1966), pp. 176-209 at 183. 110 Aïlfric's view of the complementary nature of Christian history is further demonstrated in his juxtaposition of the replenishment of the angelic host with Paul's opinion of Christ's role: 'paes haciendes tocyme and his prowung waes halwendlic aegÖer ge mannum ge englum; for 6an pe we geeacniaÖ heora werod, pe se feallenda deoful gewanode; Be pam cwaeÖ se apoštol Paulus: "paet sceoldon ealle heofenlice ping and eorÖlice beon geetstaÖolode on Criste" [Eph. 1.101' (67/1.14.152-6). 111 /Elfric is no doubt influenced here by the writings of Paul, who was the first to state plainly the relationship between Adam and Christ: 'Sicut enim per inoboedientiam unius hominis pecca- tores constituti sunt multi, ita et per unius oboedientiam iusti constituentur multi' (Romans V.19V See also I Cor. XV.22. 112 67/1.1.291-3: And he will then deliver the wicked to the devil, into the eternal fire of hell torment; the righteous he will lead with him into the kingdom of heaven, in which they shall rule to all eternity.' 113 LSig. 27-9: ťit is very wicked that created beings should not be obedient to the one who created and shaped them'. 200</page></plain_text>
