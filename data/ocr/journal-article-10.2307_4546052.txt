<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Censorship of Literary Naturalism, 1890-1895: Bavaria PETERJELAVICH WHEREAS Gary Stark suggests that there has been a ten? dency to overrate the deleterious effect of censorship upon the naturalist movement in Prussia and Saxony, this essay will argue that the opposite holds true for Bavaria. Far from being a secure haven for cultural opposition to Wilhelmine Germany, as is sometimes contended, the Bavaria ofthe Prinzregentenzeit (1886-1912) saw an upsurge of political Catholicism which placed significant con? straints upon the development of modern tendencies in the arts. Al? though the increasingly conservative tone of Bavarian politics could not prevent modernism from flourishing in Munich after 1896, it did succeed in dividing and weakening the local naturalist movement in the early 1890s. The political constellation that surrounded the naturalist movement in Bavaria was significantly different from that in Prussia or Saxony. For most of the nineteenth century, Bavarian politics was marked by a struggle between a centralizing, secularizing, and often liberal state and the Catholic Church, which had lost its lands and most of its worldly influence during the Napoleonic era. This on-again, off-again struggle was intensified after 1867, when the royal cabinet, staffed by liberal (and often Protestant) ministers, sought to allow nondenominational educa? tion and marriage, equal rights for members of all faiths, and free trade in the economic sphere. To counter these developments, as well as to ward off Bavaria's acquiescence in the creation of a Kleindeutschland under Prussian hegemony, Bavarian Catholics founded the Patrioten- partei in 1868 (renamed the Bavarian Zentrum in 1887). The Patriots quickly mobilized the peasantry and lower middle classes in Bavaria's This article is based upon research that was sponsored by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD).

The results were stunning: in 1869, the Patriots gained an absolute majority of seats in the Bavarian parliament, which they controlled until 1893 (and again after 1899). Consequently, since the 1860s Bavaria witnessed a Kulturkampf which pitted a liberal cabi? net oligarchy against the Catholic majority of the Landtag. The prestige and influence of the liberal cabinet were significandy compromised by the events of 1886, when the increasingly schizophre- nic Ludwig II had drowned while trying to escape the house arrest im- posed on him by his ministers. Since Otto, his fully psychotic brother, could not succeed him, a regency was established under Luitpold, their uncle. The travails ofthe Wittelsbachs, as well as public hostility toward a cabinet that had arrested (and, some said, murdered) a popular king, seriously weakened the authority of the executive offices from which liberal power emanated. At the same time, the growth of Social Democ? racy was depriving the liberals of their electoral bases in their urban strongholds: already in 1890, both of Munich's Reichstag seats went to Social Democrats. Crises in the royal government and a shrinking voter base forced the liberal cabinet to make concessions to the Center in the late 1880s.1 Bavarian naturalism thus arose in a period of great political instabil? ity, and its practitioners tended to side outspokenly with liberal and anti? clerical policies. Catholicism?which had reenforced its dogma with the proclamation of Mary's immaculate conception (1854), the syllabus of errors (1864), and papal infallibility (1870)?was equated with intellec? tual obscurantism, restrictive attitudes toward education and family life, and hostility to German national interests. Anticlericalism was especially pronounced in the works of Michael Georg Conrad, the staunchly lib? eral and nationalistic leader of Munich's naturalist movement and the editor of Die Gesellschaft Founded in the fall of 1884, this publication im- l.

However, with the founding ofthe Freie Biihne in 1889, Berlin became the undisputed capital of German naturalism. In order to reas- sert the importance of Munich for the modern movement, Conrad established the "Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben" in December 1890. The society's purpose was "the cultivation and propagation of the modern creative spirit in all areas (literature, art, science, and public life) through exhibitions, the creation ofa freie Biihne, the organization and exhibition of visual arts, and the issuing ofa journal and other literary publications."2 From the outset, it was clear that the new organization sought to encourage the liberal cabinet's resistance to Centrist demands. However, the Catholic press succeeded in driving a wedge of suspicion between the government and the naturalists by accusing the modern movement of harboring atheistic and Social Democratic tendencies. After the first public meeting of the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, held on 29 January 1891 before hundreds of listeners, the Catholic Munchener Frem- denblatt accused the naturalists of seeking to "overthrow the entire Christian Weltanschauung and hence to ruin our whole legal, cultural and ethical system." Although less polemical in tone, the Augsburger Abendzeitung, a conservative-liberal newspaper that stood close to the Bavarian government, noted critically that the new society espoused an "atheistic Weltanschauung."3 Conrad responded to these charges by sending a letter to the police, wherein he protested the Fremdenblatt's attempts "to depict me as an Umsturzler, atheist, nihilist, etc, and to denounce me to the state's security apparatus as a public enemy." He also dispatched letters to the local newspapers, wherein he claimed that 2. Satzungen der Gesellschaft fur modernes Leben (Munich, 1891), 3.

Julius Schaumberger and Otto Julius Bierbaum, both members ofthe executive committee of the Gesellschaft fiir mo- dernes Leben, sent the local newspapers a letter stating that they "per- sonally do not share Dr. Conrad's standpoint 'on the ground of the Gospels,' but rather subscribe to all dimensions of modern thought, even in this matter."5 Faced with the possibility of a split in his ranks, Conrad told a closed meeting of the society that he was not dogmati- cally attached to the New Testament, but rather supported its message of love, reconciliation, and the search for truth, which could be found in the Talmud or the teachings of Buddha as well. This statement was reported in the Catholic press, which concluded: "Der personliche Gott ist ihm nichts!"6 Even more severe charges of blasphemy were leveled against Hanns von Gumppenberg, the author of a drama, Messias, which appeared in Munich's bookstores in February. Like other naturalist portrayals of Christ,7 the play depicted Jesus as a thoroughly human, nondivine apos- tle of peace and social justice, who advanced his ideals by concocting lies about his divine parentage, and by staging seemingly magical charades (e.g., "resurrecting" the putatively dead daughter of Jairus). The Mun? chener Fremdenblatt and other Catholic publications immediately decried the work as blasphemous. Gumppenberg replied to his critics on 27 February at the second public meeting ofthe Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, where he delivered a talk "On the Aesthetic Treatment of Reli? gious Subjects." The Munchener Fremdenblatt reported that in this lec? ture, Gumppenberg had spoken of Christ as a "lacherlicher Popanz" and a"widerliche Gestalt"?a report which virtually forced the public prose? cutor to initiate proceedings against Gumppenberg for blasphemy. The charges were dropped, however, when the reporter of the Fremdenblatt would not state under oath that Gumppenberg had used the reported 4- Conrad to the Polizeidirektion Munchen, 3 Feb. 1891, in Staatsarchiv Munchen (hereafter SAM), RA 57851; and the Augsburger Abendzeitung, 4 Feb. 1891. 5.

In reality, Gumppenberg had said merely that the Catholic image of Christ was that of an abstract and unreal "Popanz," in contrast to his own Messias, which had tried to humanize Jesus.8 Charges of atheism and blasphemy created some confusion and dis- sension in the ranks of the naturalists, but the greatest damage was caused by insinuations that they harbored Social Democratic sympa? thies. To be sure, it appeared initially that Munich's "modern" writers and the Social Democrats might indeed form an alliance. In the winter and spring of 1890-1891, Conrad, Julius Schaumberger, and Oskar Panizza held lectures before a dozen working-class associations, with audiences of up to a thousand people, on subjects ranging from tubercu? losis to modern theater. The Social Democratic Munchener Post wel- comed these overtures to workers and cautiously approved the forma? tion of the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben.9 Consequently, after the first public meeting of that society, the Munchener Fremdenblatt called the naturalists "socialists in tail coats" ("Sozialisten im Frack") who were even more dangerous than the proletarian Social Democrats: "this so? cialism of kid gloves... wants to carry out among the upper ten thou? sand the work that the Social Democrats are carrying out among the 'socially dispossessed.'"10 Constant repetition of this accusation in the Catholic press during the ensuing weeks raised the suspicions of the Munich police, who concluded by April: "As far as can be ascertained by now, the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben pursues a realistic course in the area of literature and art which opposes accepted views (dengel- tenden Anschauungen) where these do not conform to 'modern' opinions ... A complete picture ofthe society cannot yet be made, inasmuch as the public evenings are attended by people from the better classes of society as well as by members of the Social Democratic organization. There is no doubt that some members ofthe society are younger writers who unreservedly draw near to the Social Democrats."11 On the basis 8.

Since the state was obviously worried about the social radicalism of the naturalists, the Catholic press finally succeeded in having Gumppen- berg imprisoned for his presentation at the third public evening of the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, on 20 March, where he read verses by Karl Henckell, a Berlin poet with socialist sympathies. One of the poems?"An die deutsche Nation"?implied that the "Kaiserthron" was a seat of injustice and megalomania. While the naturalist writers and the workers in the audience applauded the poem, several officers voiced their disapproval and walked out. Thus it came as no surprise that the Fremdenblatt accused Gumppenberg of having attacked the Kai? ser personally as well as the institution of monarchy in general.12 Since German law required that all probable cases of Majestatsbeleidigung be brought to court, Gumppenberg was promptly indicted. In his defense, he argued that he did not share the political views of Henckell, but rather was attracted to the poem's artistic qualities. His attorney further noted that he had simply read a poem from a book that was sold openly. The prosecutor responded that German law applied more stringent cen? sorship standards to the spoken than to the written word, since people were more easily swayed by speeches and plays than by books. The judges ruled that Gumppenberg had not intended to insult the Kaiser or any other crowned head, but he must have known that the poem would be a public provocation: hence they sentenced him to two months of fortress arrest.13 The prosecution of Gumppenberg for Majestatsbeleidigung, though forced by a report in the Catholic press, also served the interests ofthe Bavarian state. On the one hand, it had a vested interest in maintaining monarchical authority intact. The position of Bavaria's liberal and Prot? estant elite was secured by the Wittelsbach's proclivity for appointing liberal cabinets, as well as by the country's allegiance to the Protestant Kaiser: attacks on monarchical authority at either the state or the impe? rial level threatened the pillars of liberal Protestant rule.

The successful prosecution of Gumppenberg, the author of a "blasphemous" play who had also recited a putatively socialist poem, was the logical outcome of a political constellation marked by resurgent Catholicism, weakened monarchical authority, and a Social Democratic movement that was gaining electoral strength at the expense of the liberals. While the liberal government was most concerned with the threats posed by Majestatsbeleidigung and social radicalism, blasphemy and ob? scenity were the offenses of Munich's naturalists that most provoked Bavarian Catholics. Since mid-century, the resurgence of Catholicism had been based upon a tightening of doctrinal authority and a strength? ening of familial values, both of which seemed to be threatened by the naturalists' questioning attitudes toward religion and sexual behavior. Given the state's sensitivity to Catholic concerns, it was not surprising that within a few days of Gumppenberg's conviction, the police con? fiscated the twenty-second issue ofthe Moderne Blatter, the weekly mag? azine of the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, as well as 545 copies of Modernes Leben, an anthology of works by Munich naturalists. The Moderne Blatter were seized for the alleged obscenity of Anna Croissant- Rust's story of a bride's fears on her wedding night, while the anthology was confiscated on multiple charges of obscenity and blasphemy in con? nection with works by Bierbaum, Conrad, Schaumberg, Panizza, and Julius Scharf.14 In contrast to the outcome of Gumppenberg's indictment for lese majesty, the confiscations ofthe Moderne Blatter and the Modernes Leben anthology were soon overturned by the courts. Much of the problem resided in the judicial imprecision ofthe terms "blasphemy" and espe? cially "obscenity." In the 1880s, the Imperial Supreme Court had ruled that works were to be deemed "unzuchtig" only if they offended the public in a grossly sexual manner. This relatively narrow definition of obscenity allowed much "offensive" material to pass unpunished. The swift release of the Moderne Blatter upon appeal induced the Munich police to send a letter to their superiors in the Interior Ministry of Upper 14.

Clerical circles and the Center could be appeased by handing "blasphemers" and "pornographers" over to the courts, but liberals would not be overly aggrieved, since convictions were highly unlikely. In 1900 this practice was made ex- plicit by Max von Feilitzsch, the Bavarian minister of the interior, in response to a police query concerning the advisability of prosecuting the chairman ofthe Munich Freethinkers' Society for attacking the Catholic practice of confession: "Since the Center had repeatedly claimed that the Catholic Church in Bavaria has not received adequate protection against insults?as guaranteed by article 14 of the Concordat?the Royal Ministry of the Interior cannot avoid the opinion that it would be advisable, simply for political reasons, to put the case before a court. Admittedly, the case might result in exoneration or dismissal, but this is of no concern to us, since after such a judicial exoneration or dismissal ofthe case, the charge can no longer be made that the state has not done everything it could in order to ensure the punishment of an insult."17 In fact, the naturalists did not suffer severely at the hands ofthe Bavar? ian courts in 1891. The only conviction was that of Gumppenberg, who had offended the Bavarian state by reciting a socially radical antimon- archical poem; all indictments and confiscations based upon the "anti- Catholic" offenses of blasphemy and pornography were overturned by the courts. Nevertheless, by maintaining pressure on the naturalists through the press and the prosecutor, Catholic circles succeeded in waging a war of nerves that eventually destroyed the Gesellschaft fiir 15- Polizeidirektion Miinchen to Kgl.

While the recitations and publications ofthe Munich naturalists left them vulnerable to prosecution, hostility to the move? ment was so great that it never had the opportunity to present its works on stage in the early 1890s. Three of Munich's four theaters?the Na- tionaltheater, the Residenztheater, and the Theater am Gartnerplatz? were owned by the state, and hence would not sponsor naturalist works. In fact, it appears that conditions at the court theaters became more stringent in 1891. Although the Residenztheater had demonstrated some liberality by mounting several major productions of Ibsen's plays in the 1880s, the world premiere of Hedda Gabler was terminated after three performances at the end of January 1891?less than two weeks after the first public meeting of the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, and at a time when the local Catholic press was replete with attacks on the modern movement. Indeed, later that year the Residenztheater staged two plays that parodied modern theater?Paul Lindau's Die Sonne and Paul Heyse's Wahrheit??and it did not mount another new production of a play by Ibsen until 1897. Likewise, Munich's only private theater, the Volkstheater, was not amenable to staging modern drama: it spe? cialized in folk plays and musicals, and would in any case have had to submit naturalist plays to prior censorship had it wanted to stage them. Consequently, one ofthe major goals ofthe Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben was the creation of a Freie Biihne like that in Berlin, which would evade censorship by sponsoring "closed" performances of modernist and controversial works. The project faced insuperable difficulties, how? ever, given the fact that Munich's limited theatrical resources were con? trolled by the state. Even though the royal theaters routinely allowed their stages and actors to be hired for (non-controversial) corporate performances, in February 1891 they refused to permit the naturalists to make use of their troupe or their facilities. Two months later, a restau- rant owner agreed to let the naturalists stage plays in his establishment, but he promptly withdrew his agreement under pressure from Catholic circles.18 The Munich naturalists thus failed to mount any dramatic produc? tions by the time that the Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben disinte- grated, for all practical purposes, in December 1891. By the end of September, Schaumberger could write: "With united effort we have brought it to the point where the police and the courts are actively con- i8.

In August Oskar Panizza wrote: "They call us pigs, wallowers in manure, fin-de-siecle men, literary social democrats, and who knows what else; but they read us, discuss us, attend our soi- rees, buy our books, our pamphlets, etc."20 This optimistic assessment was not shared by Michael Georg Conrad. Just as he had responded to the initial charges of blasphemy by trumpeting his standpoint "on the ground ofthe Gospels" to the police and reporters, he answered charges of socialism by pointedly attacking the Social Democrats in the pages of the Moderne Blatter in the summer and fall of 1891. This not only alien- ated the workers, who ceased attending the meetings ofthe Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben, but also led to tensions between Conrad and his younger, more radical colleagues. In December Conrad resigned the chairmanship ofthe society he had founded, and wrote to the police: "giving way to the radical undercurrents ofthe 'thorough-going' mod- ernists, I have resigned my position as chairman ofthe Gesellschaft fiir modernes Leben."21 The man who had protested the Fremdenblatt''s attempts "to denounce me to the state's security apparatus" was himself quite eager to alert the police to the "radical undercurrents" among his colleagues. The police, however, had little more to accomplish, inas- much as the society disintegrated soon after Conrad's resignation. Gary Stark notes that in Prussia and Saxony, "censorship inadvertently aided literary naturalism ... by helping to coalesce and consolidate the nascent movement." In contrast, harassment by courts and prosecutors contributed significantly to its dissolution in Munich. After 1891 a pro? cess of polarization occurred, best exemplified by the careers of Michael Georg Conrad and Oskar Panizza. As might be expected, Conrad inter- nalized the official norms established during the conflicts of that year. In December 1892 he drew up a contract for a new journal with Max Poessl, the publisher of many naturalist works in the Bavarian capital. The terms of the contract indicate that both Conrad and Poessl were anxious to avoid the issues that had been so troublesome a year earlier: Mutual declaration ofthe tendency ofthe weekly to be edited by Dr. Conrad for Mr. M.

In contrast, discern- ing commentaries on atheism, as a contemporary phenomenon, will be al? lowed freely. 2) The same holds true for Social Democracy. Everything that could arouse the opinion that the new journal has a Social Democratic tendency and is thus a Social Democratic party newspaper is absolutely impermissible. However, criticism and discussion of social-political questions, and at times even an open support of one or another Social Democratic demand, are fully permitted. 3) Poems and novellas of immoral character are impermissible, especially since the new journal does not intend to cultivate these two genres. However, occasionally room will be granted for a moderately erotic poem or a mod? erately erotic novella (fiir ein gemassigt-erotisches Gedicht oder fiir eine gemdssigt- erotische Novelle); and naturally it is permitted to address sexual questions, e.g., prostitution, in a scientific and respectable manner.22 This document clearly indicates that the state and the clerical circles had imparted their anti-atheist, anti-socialist and anti-pornographic norms to Munich's most famous naturalist writer and to an important local publisher. Oskar Panizza was well aware ofthe same norms, but his reaction to them was diametrically opposed to that of Conrad: he systematically sought to transgress the strictures that had been reinforced in 1891. Raised in a spirit of hostility to Catholicism by his ardently Protestant mother, Panizza was eager to challenge the Church and its supporters. As public prosecutors came to the defense of Catholic interests, Panizza turned against the Bavarian state as well. A reading ofthe works of Max Stirner and others led Panizza to develop an idiosyncratic anarchist ideology which made it morally imperative to challenge all secular and clerical authorities. He thus proceeded to write poems, essays, and short stories dealing with social radicalism, sexual deviance, and religious fanaticism. A major reason for the confiscation ofthe Modernes Leben anthology was the inclusion of a story by Panizza concerning masturba- tion. He proceeded to write two virulently anti-Catholic books that were also banned, and he parodied the censorship of sexual subjects in Der heilige Staatsanwalt, a short play published in 1894.

At a time when the Church was promoting mariolatry and the doctrine of papal infal- libility, Panizza composed a grotesque dramatization ofthe Holy Fam? ily and the papal court. The play is set in 1495, a year which saw Alex? ander VI (alias Rodrigo Borgia) on the throne of St. Peter as well as the first documented outbreak of syphilis in Europe. The drama explains the temporal coincidence of these two events by arguing that venereal disease was a form of divine retribution for papal iniquity. This plot line allowed Panizza to delve into the sexual perversions practiced in the Vatican at the time ofthe Borgia pope, the historical veracity of which he documented in extensive footnotes. More fanciful and more offen- sive was his depiction ofthe Holy Family in heaven: God is an old, dod- dering fool; Jesus is simple-minded and impotent; the Holy Ghost appears as a rocket streaking across the stage; and the Virgin Mary is vivacious, vain, and perpetually concerned with her sexual allure. As Conrad noted, Panizza presented the Catholic pantheon with "merciless naturalism";24 he reduced anthropomorphic religiosity to absurdity by turning the Holy Family into family farce. Das Liebeskonzil was obviously written as a provocation ofthe Cath? olic church, and the Bavarian authorities could not stand idly by. Ironi- cally, they learned of the play from a favorable review in the Social Democratic Munchener Post, which found the work "geistreich und sehr lesenswerth."25 On 8 January 1895, the prosecutor in Munich ordered all copies ofthe play confiscated, and he proceeded to indict Panizza for "crimes against religion, committed through the press." This indict- ment turned out to be rather complicated. On the one hand, it was arguable that Panizza could not be tried in Germany, since the play had been printed in Switzerland. The prosecutor thus had to prove that the author "consciously and willingly" desired its sale and circulation in the Reich. On the other hand, the case could not come to court until the police had received a formal complaint about the play. The police inter- 23.

When asked to give the names of buyers, the book- sellers initially refused; only after threats of legal action did one book- seller name Josef Ruederer and Ludwig Quidde, outspoken anti-clericals who would hardly have been offended by the work. The police suc? ceeded in identifying and questioning another purchaser, the writer Ludwig Steinitzer, who, though Catholic, was likewise uncomplying: he found the play's content "stark," but felt that "because of its manner and style of presentation, it cannot be taken seriously."26 Frustrated in their search for enraged readers in the Bavarian capital, the Munich police asked their colleagues in other German cities whether they could locate offended purchasers of the play. The Leipzig police department reported that upon receipt ofthe inquiry, two of its officers had read the book and taken offense at its contents ("an den Panizza'schen Druckschrift Aergernis genommen haben").27 The Munich prosecutor decided that the dutiful Leipzig gendarmes would suffice as offended citizens, and proceeded with the case. Despite the weakness ofthe prosecution's arguments?its substitution of investigative officers for outraged citizens, and its indictment of an author whose work had been published abroad?Panizza likewise was unwilling to allow legal irregularities to stand in the way of his trial: he very much wanted a public forum to attack the Church and the state that defended it. Das Liebeskonzil was a provocation that called for judicial retribution; it begged to be put on trial. Panizza's friends urged him to flee Germany, since they believed that he would receive the maximum (three year) sentence for blasphemy. Panizza thought that he would be acquitted, but in any case, he considered it his civic duty to stay in Munich and to confront the Catholic Church and the Bavarian state. Panizza thus assumed an aggressive stance at his trial, which was held on 30 April 1895. With regard to the appropriateness of being prosecuted for a work published abroad, he brazenly admitted that he desired its circulation in Germany: "I wanted my literary friends in Munich to read the book, I also wanted wider circles in Germany to take note of the work in order to make propaganda for the ideas it 26.

Thus it was my desire and intent to circulate the book, Das Liebeskonzil, in Germany."28 Panizza defended himself against charges of blasphemy by saying that the papacy itself had been blasphemous: "I denigrated the Christian gods [sic] and did so very intentionally, because I saw them in the mirror ofthe fifteenth century; I saw them through the papal spectacles of Alexander VI."29 More generally, Panizza hoped to hit the Catholic Church at its most vulnerable points, namely the relatively recent doctrines of Mary's im- maculate conception and retroactive papal infallibility. He implied that it would be hard to imagine the Borgia pope as a mouthpiece of God, even when speaking ex cathedra. With respect to the Holy Family, Panizza contended already during his initial interrogation (12 January 1895): "Through the portrayal of Christ as an impotent, consumptive person I wanted to depict the dispossession of Christ by the mariolatry ofthe Catholic Church. According to Catholic doctrine, the worship of Christ has fallen far behind the cult of Mary ..." Panizza noted further that he felt justified in treating Mary as an "erotic" person because that was precisely the way she had been depicted in numerous Jesuit pictures and pamphlets; he had provided documentation of this fact in his pre? vious book, Der deutsche Michel und der romische Papst, which had been banned on account of its virulently anti-Catholic content.30 In short, Panizza argued that it was the Catholic Church that had blasphemed against Christ and the Blessed Virgin. These ironical arguments had little impact on the jury, which heeded the prosecutor's injunction to make an example of Panizza that his col? leagues would not forget. The defendant was sentenced to a year injail, and one juror quipped after the trial: "If that dog had been tried in Lower Bavaria, he wouldn't have gotten away alive."31 Panizza thus received the harshest sentence meted out to a writer during the Wilhel? mine period, inasmuch as several weeks of fortress arrest was the norm for most "crimes committed in the press." Panizza's imprisonment symbolically marked the end of the first 28. See the protocol of Panizza's trial at the Landgericht Miinchen I, 30 Apr. 1895, SAM/St. Anw. 7119. 29.

To be sure, it is unlikely that Munich's naturalists could have matched the success of their Prus? sian and Saxon counterparts even under more favorable political condi? tions. However, it is also hard to deny that censorship?in the form of confiscations, indictments, trials, and two major convictions?seriously inhibited their activities. The Bavarian state and the Catholic press, though at odds on many issues, acted in concert to establish norms against Social Democracy, "blasphemy," and "pornography." Con? stant harassment by prosecutors and the press caused confusion, not solidarity, in the ranks ofthe naturalists. Censorship polarized Munich's modern writers in the early 1890s. Some, like Conrad, were cowed into accepting official norms, while others increased their vociferousness; but those who dared to be most outspoken were given the opportunity to reconsider their views in the enforced leisure of jail or fortress arrest. Of course, censorship did not stifle Munich's modernist movement. After all, in 1896, while Panizza was still sitting in jail, literary and artistic modernism saw the beginning of a new upsurge in Munich, heralded by the appearance of Jugend and Simplicissimus and consolidated by the founding ofthe Schauspielhaus (1898), Munich's first successful theater devoted to modern drama. At the same time, however, the political power of the Center increased continually, and the pattern of conflict established by the naturalists in 1891 was repeated continuously. Even though satirical journals like Simplicissimus may have benefitted from the increased publicity generated by repeated confiscations, other aspects of modernist culture were not as fortunate: controversial plays were regularly banned from stage (and such prohibitions could not be overturned by appealing to the courts, as in Prussia); more adventurous avant-garde theatrical groups like the Elf Scharfrichter cabaret and the Akademisch-Dramatischer Verein were forced to close under pressure from Centrist politicians; and writers like Frank Wedekind and Ludwig Thoma who carried on the fight against authoritarian monarchism and repressive morality earned themselves several weeks to several months of fortress arrest.32 Despite the brilliance ofthe Munich avant-garde at 32.

After all, the current (1983) cultural cause celebre in Germany centers around Das Gespenst, a film by the Bavarian play- wright, Herbert Achternbusch. The film's "updated" and caricatured depictions of Christ and Mary?in part inspired by Panizza's Liebeskon? zil?has provoked Friedrich Zimmermann, the CSU minister of the interior, to retract retroactively government funding for the movie and to consider prosecuting Achternbusch for blasphemy.34 Far from being the end-point of earlier struggles against censorship, the travails ofthe Munich naturalists marked the beginning of an intermittent conflict between modern artists and the conservative Catholic populism that has come to dominate Bavarian politics in the twentieth century.
