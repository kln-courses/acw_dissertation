<plain_text><page sequence="1">64 REVIEW OF BOOKS S. P. Brock- Ch. T. Fritsch-S. Jellicoe, Λ Classified Bibliography of the Septuagint (Arbeiten zur Literatur und Geschichte des hellenistischen Judentums VI), E. J. Brill, Leiden 1973, XVIII and 217 pp., cloth f 56,— (Though being selective for the literature prior to 1900, this bibliography covers the period 1860-1969 and aims throughout at providing by means of a fairly elaborate subject classification a practical guide to the literature under consideration. From areas marginal to the study of the LXX only items primarily concerned with the LXX are included. Due to the subject classification of the material in some cases the same item is entered fully in two or more sections, but mostly cross references are given (at the head of each section and in the left hand margins). Occasionally explanatory notes are given in square brackets and sometimes important reviews are included. "Septuagint" is taken to consist of the books featuring in Rahlfs's edition. The volume contains the following 41 sections: Introductions, Concor dances, Editions and Translations of the LXX, Survey articles, Personalia, Significance of LXX, General, Inspiration of LXX, Canon, LXX as a Translation (and Biblical Translation in general), Characteristics and Back ground, Particular Concepts, Anthropomorphism/-pathism, Hellenistic Exegesis, Language, Translation Technique, Divine Names, Proper Names and Onomastica, Translations, Wutz's theory, Pseudo-Aristeas, Proto LXX, Later History of LXX, LXX and MT, LXX and Qumran, LXX and Peshitta/Targum, LXX and NT, Philo, Josephus, Apostolic Fathers, Patristica, Origen, Jerome, Studies on Editions, Manuscripts, Textual Studies, Hexapla, Other Greek Translations, Individual Books (pp. 98-144), Versions (pp. 144-194), Illustration of LXX. The volume concludes with a very useful Index of authors. Needless to say, this bibliography will certainly be a great help to biblical and classical scholars. A cursory examination of a number of sections has brought the present reviewer to the conclusion that everything of importan ce has been included. The authors deserve warmest thanks for their pain staking and self-sacrificing work). vd\X׳ .</page></plain_text>
