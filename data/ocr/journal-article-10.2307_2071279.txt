<plain_text><page sequence="1">Five Bodies: The Human Shape of Modern Society, by JOHN O'NEILL. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985. 184 pp. $17.50 cloth. NORMAN K. DENZIN University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign The social sciences lack a coherent framework for making sense of the human body. There is no sociology of the body. The academic institutional- ization of sociology as a discipline placed the body in other realms of discourse, including medicine and biology (Bryan Turner, The Body and Society, 1984). O'Neill's Five Bodies takes the human body as a point of departure for theorizing about the modern relationship between individuals, human nature, politics, the family, society, economics, health, sanity, and the tyranny of technology and biomed- icine. He proposes a radical anthropomorphism that will hopefully restore a human dimension to the shape of contemporary social institutions. He explores the costs of dehumanizing the human body in modern times. This is a political economy of the human body that tends, in the main, to be less radical, less comprehensive, and more conser- vative than its author claims. He wants, that is, to restore the sanctity of the human family in the postmodern period, and he chastises radical feminists for going too far on sexuality, abortion, children's rights, divorce, communal living, and so on (114, 138). O'Neill offers an analysis, largely structural and ahistorical, of the modern therapeutic state that has taken control over our bodies and our families. His analysis does not have the bite of Turner's. He takes up in successive chapters the prosthetic god (after Freud), our two bodies, the world's body, social bodies, the body politic, consumer bodies, medical bodies, and the future shape of human beings. The first three chapters work outward from a structural anthropology that argues, after Durkheim and Levi-Strauss, that society and social structure are mapped upon social images of familied, gendered bodies. The rational categories of social classification that Durkheim and Mauss identified derive from the basic divisions between the sexes and those social groups connected to kinship and the family. This argument is familiar, although too often forgotten. Society is built upon an anthropo- morphic image of man, woman, and family. The phrase "body politic" of course reflects this conception.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 O'Neill builds a three-level model of the body politic (81): the bio-body connected to the family and to discourses concerning health; the productive body joined to work and discourses concerning self-control; and the libidinal body, joined to the personality and to discourses concerning desire, pleasure, and happiness. The center of the book lies in chapters 4 and 5. I will focus my remaining comments on chapter 4 ("Consumer Bodies"), for here O'Neill draws close to a cultural semiotics that will be of use in future theorizing about postmodern social structure and the sociology of the body. The central thesis of chapter 4 may be stated as follows: "The body and its needs have become commodified objects within the subsistence (wel- fare) and prestige (leisure, desire) economies of late capitalism." The body and its needs are manufactured, purchased, exchanged, exploited, and devalued in the contemporary consumption society, to employ Baudrillard's phrase (For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, 1981). This is not a new insight; the Critical School was arguing this thirty or more years ago. However, O'Neill offers a series of brilliantly tantalizing insights concerning how surplus value in the late capitalist system increases the fantasy work that contributes to the belief that the economic system is in the service of individuals. In fact, individuals are in the service of the system. He shows how this operates at the level of the American automobile (97), the household (104-105), leisure and exercise (109), and sexuality (112). Following Baudrillard (99), he shows how a logic of exchange has taken over the economy. In this exchange structure, commodity relations are bought and sold. Unfortunately O'Neill does not extend Baudril- lard, whose work has shown how the ideology of late capitalism has invaded the signs of the commodities that form the basis of the exchange relations in postmodern life. Baudrillard's merger of semiotics and Marxism makes it no longer possible to separate bodies and objects from the languages that represent them. The signs of capitalism (i.e., the language of advertising) have penetrated the human bodies that the economy requires for its reproduction. Not only are we now involved in commodity exchange relations; we have become commodities. Humans have become signs of themselves. By virtue of our entry into the realm of the social we have been given ideological meanings that transcend our elementary basic humanness. A representational theory of the body is thus required, and O'Neill does not offer it. (Nor does Turner, although he makes representation one of the categories of his theory.) Language, the most human of human inven- tions, has turned against us. The prison-house of language contains and constrains at the same time. Our glassy essence (Peirce) now eludes us. As we represent ourselves to ourselves we find that all we are and all we can be has already been given to us. This is the hollow legacy of late capitalism. The irony, of course, is that our lived bodies stand at the center of this self-awareness; yet we lack the words to put into place meanings that allow us to rise above the emptiness. Our bodies can't feel and give meanings to the commodities we shower upon them. A radical anthropomorphizing of the human disciplines is not sufficient. Such a move only involves moving words around. What we need is a radical theorizing of language itself. This O'Neill has not done. A sociology of the body must in these senses become existential, phenomenologi- cal, deconstructive, semiological, and much more deeply historical and cultural. As this sociology is written we will find a natural home for our theories of religion, politics, science, medicine, the econ- omy, language, education, and stratification. This home will be, as Heidegger reminded us, in language and in the being who dwells in language. A sociology of the body must, that is, position the human being at the center of the human disci- plines.</page></plain_text>
