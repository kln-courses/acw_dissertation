LODRICK Center for South Asia Studies, University of California, 10 Stephens Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-2310, USA (E-mail: derycklodrick@yahoo.com) Abstract. Domesticated Indian zebu cattle were present on the western margins of the South Asian subcontinent as early as 6000 B.C. Cattle were important in the agricultural economy of the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley, but archaeological evidence suggests the bull was also assuming a symbolic or religious role in this culture during the third millennium B.C. There is, however, little to suggest that the cow was viewed as sacred. Following the decline of the Harappan civilization, northwestern India was settled by Aryan-speaking peoples who laid the foundations of modern Indian society. The Aryans were pastoral by nature and the economic importance of cattle to this society is mirrored in the role of cattle in ritual, in the pastoral symbolism of the Vedic literature (the ancient religious literature of Hinduism), and also in the association of the cow with various Vedic deities. Yet, again there is nothing to suggest the cow was viewed as sacred at this time. It is not until the appearance of the ahimsa philosophy at the end of the Vedic period, and the acceptance of this belief in the major religious philosophies of the region (Jainism, Buddhism, and later Hinduism), that the concept of the sanctity and inviolability of the cow began to crystallize. The "sacred-cow concept" appears as established doctrine in Hindu literature by the end of the medieval period (ca. fourth century A.D.), although popular practice appears to be at variance with this doctrine. A variety of historical, political, religious and social factors appear to have contributed to the general acceptance of the sacred cow doctrine by the Hindu popu? lation at large. During the 1960s, the "sacred cow" was at the center of a controversy in the social sciences concerning whether the concept was essentially religious in nature or reflected the ecological realities of the cattle economy of the Indian subcontinent. This debate notwithstanding, cattle remain central to the Indian economy, but also play a significant role in the religion and rituals of modern Hinduism, particularly those related to the worship of Krishna. Cattle have also assumed a political role in contemporary India, with anti-cow-slaughter legislation and the protection of the cow being identified with the emerging Hindutva movement. No understanding of South Asian culture can be complete without an awareness of the economic, historical, political and religious dimensions of cattle in the Indian subcontinent. Keywords: sacred-cow concept, South Asia Introduction As part of the physical world, animals have formed an integral element of the environments in which humans evolved and in which we live</page><page sequence="2">62 DERYCK O. LODRICK today. The earliest relationship between humans and animals, one might reasonably assume, was the predator-prey relationship, with certain animal species - those that could be caught and killed using the tech? nology and techniques available at the time - hunted for food and used as a source of other material supplies. Although this relationship was not exclusively unidirectional (even today, in the Sundarbans of the Ganges Delta, tigers, whose habitat is under pressure, stalk and kill humans for food), the role of animals as a source of food is perhaps a fundamental one in human-animal interactions and arguably the one of greatest antiquity. However, as human consciousness evolved, so did efforts to understand the world, and the relationships between man and animals began to assume a more complex form, moving beyond simply the predator-prey relationship. Cave paintings from widely dispersed sites in the Old World (e.g. France, Spain, northern Africa, and Aus? tralia) suggest that by around 40,000 years ago, animals had assumed a much more important position in the human psyche than merely as food. Whether Paleolithic cave paintings involve mere representations of fauna, sympathetic hunting magic, or the development of some aesthetic or spiritual awareness relating to animals, they indicate that animals played an expanding role in the consciousness of humans. This role subsequently grew to encompass a range of animism, totemism and religious symbolism, and became even more complex following the domestication of food animals beginning around 10,000 years ago. The emergence of agriculture, based on specific groupings of domesticated plants and animals, provided the foundations for sedentary societies, made possible the emergence of urban civilizations, and ultimately al? lowed the evolution of contemporary society. Today, in addition to symbolic and economic functions, animals have acquired social func? tions, e.g. as pets and indicators of social status, and in some areas of the world have even assumed political roles. Clearly, animals play dif? ferent roles in different societies at different times in history.1 Nowhere have these roles been so complex as in South Asia; and perhaps nowhere have the attitudes, beliefs and practices associated with one species in particular, cattle, been so complex as in this region. Cattle in South Asian prehistory Recent studies reveal that the zebu (Bos indicus), the humped domes? ticated cattle of South Asia, is descended from a subspecies of the aurochs (Bos primigenius namadicus) that differentiated genetically from</page><page sequence="3">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 63 the wild ancestor (Bos primigenius primigenius) of the domesticated cattle of Europe (Bos taurus) at least 600,000 years ago.2'3 While the nature and processes of cattle domestication form the subject of intense scholarly debate, both zebu and taurine cattle appear to have been domesticated in southwest Asia around 10,000 years ago. Remains of domesticated cattle dated from around 6000 BC have been recovered from archeological sites in a belt from Greek Thessaly to Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and it is reasonable to assume that the first domesti? cation of cattle occurred in this region. The genetic distance between domesticated taurine and zebu cattle, however, is such as to suggest quite separate domestications, and one can speculate that zebu domestication occurred in the eastern areas of this range. The aurochs, the ancestor of both zebu and taurine cattle, none? theless, roamed extensive areas of Eurasia. The striking depictions of wild cattle at Paleolithic sites such as Lascaux in France's Dordogne region4'5 suggest the animal made a strong impression on the minds of early humans in Europe, and the same can be said of the aurochs in South Asia. The prehistoric cave-paintings, etchings and rock-bruisings found scattered across the Indian subcontinent provide a record of contemporary fauna and include the wild ancestor of zebu cattle. The earliest depictions show animals, often life-sized and on their own, and some authors speculate that these may reflect possible religious moti? vations for the paintings.6 Later Mesolithic art, as at Narsinghgarh, presents scenes of humans hunting wild cattle which Robert R. Brooks and Vishnu S. Wakankar see as possibly representing hunting magic or ceremonial magic.6 A painting dated to the Mesolithic at Bhimbetka shows a hunting scene, with hunters, along with a figure identified as a wizard or shaman, dancing around a zebu bull. Other Mesolithic paintings from Bhimbetka depicting the sport of bull-jumping, with humans somersaulting over the back of bulls, suggest some exposure to the Indus Valley and Cretan cultures, where this sport was common.7 However, this has also been interpreted as hill peoples recording scenes from more advanced valley cultures. Beyond this, while humped - presumably domesticated - cattle (both bulls and cows) become com? mon in Neolithic paintings, there are but few instances of cattle in a clearly religious or ceremonial context.8 A cave painting from Sujan pura, dated to the Neolithic or later, shows a bull being driven to an altar which has been encircled with the skulls of bulls, possibly previous sacrificial victims.6 The possible ritual or ceremonial purpose of burning dung that produced the Neolithic ash mounds of southern India remains a matter of controversy.9'10 Thus, it is to the archeological</page><page sequence="4">64 DERYCK O. LODRICK evidence of the Harappan civilization that one must turn for the first incontrovertible evidence of the ritual or ceremonial role of cattle in South Asia. Harappan civilization Indian cattle, i.e. zebu cattle, were most likely domesticated in the western margins of South Asia. Zooarcheological evidence from sites such as Mehrgarh, in what is now Baluchistan, suggests domesticated cattle were present by around 6000 B.C.11-13 Pottery representations of the zebu are found at Mehrgarh, but it is in the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley that one finds clear indications that cattle - or at least the bull - fulfilled a symbolic as well as an economic role in contemporary society. Numerous remains of young animals found at sites throughout the region indicate that cattle were a major source of food for the Indus Valley peoples14-16 and there are indications that milk was also an important item of food.17 Like the early urban civilizations to the west, the Harappan civilization was based on a thriving agriculture and supported by cereal cultivation and domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats, but of these animals it was only cattle - and specifically the bull - that appears to have been elevated to a position of prominence over and above that of merely a source of food. Numerous representations of the bull on seals and as figurines in Harappan civilization attest, at the very least, to the animal's popularity as an artistic motif and hints, perhaps, at a symbolic or ceremonial role, although the nature of this latter is still unclear. The purpose of the figurines in Indus Valley society is unknown, although some, such as the wheeled zebu figurines recovered from the site of Harappa, appear to have been crafted as toys. Other figurines, however, such as the terra cotta replicas of buffalo horns or the composite or anthropomorphic animal figures appear to have been worn as amulets, suggesting a possible ritual function. However, it is the seals of the Indus civilization that raise the most intriguing questions. These depict both zebu and taurine bulls, as well as a "unicorn"-like creature (perhaps a bull with only one horn portrayed as in archaic Sumerian convention) and other animals such as the tiger and the elephant. But the frequency of depictions of the bull on the seals makes it clear that male bovines were important symbols for the peoples of the Indus Valley civilization.18'19 The precise nature of this symbolic role, however, remains open to interpretation. Walter A. Fairservis20 notes that the depiction of cattle</page><page sequence="5">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 65 on Harappan seals seems to emphasize the power and strength of the bull rather than the economic role of cattle. A.L. Basham21 goes so far as to argue that the bull was sacred, while Douglas Hamilton Gordon comments that certain seals represent bull and buffalo-sacrifice, bull baiting and bull-leaping in a clearly religious or ritual context.22 Ernest MacKay proposes that the short-horned bull depicted on seals might be a vehicle or emblem of the god of war.15 It is of interest that in India today the bull is sacred to Shiva and that the cult of Shiva has been traced to the Harappan civilization.23 Sir John Marshall has identified, on an Indus Valley seal, a Proto-Shiva in the aspect of Pashupati, Lord of the Beasts, although there is a question if the three-faced fertility god depicted on the seal is specifically associated with the bull, as is the Shiva of later Hinduism.14'24~26 Whatever the precise nature of the bull's ceremonial, ritual or reli? gious role in the Indus Valley civilization, the cow is noticeable by its absence in terms of pictorial representations. One seal depicts a horned goddess in a pipal tree (Ficus religiosa) being worshipped by a horned figure. This deity resembles the horned Mother Goddess of Egypt and Mesopotamia and suggests that there was indeed a cult of the Mother Goddess in Harappan civilization. Marshall contends that the numer? ous terracotta female figurines recovered from Indus Valley sites probably represents a goddess with attributes similar to that of the "great Mother Goddess" of the cultural traditions further to the west. Thus, while there is no evidence for the sanctity of the cow in the Indus Valley civilization, E.O. James23 is of the opinion that the concept has its roots, in part, at least, in the Indo-Iranian Mother Goddess cult where the "Great Mother was herself the cow giving her milk as the life bestowing agent par excellence in the process of suckling." The Cow as Goddess emerges as a central thread in the later religious life of the South Asian subcontinent. Cattle in Vedic India The doctrine of the sanctity of the cow and related practices associated with the cow in South Asia are relatively late developments in Hindu religious thought. However, as W. Norman Brown27 has indicated, many ideas critical to the doctrine's formulation have their antecedents in Vedic India, where cattle played both an important economic role as well as a symbolic one.</page><page sequence="6">66 DERYCK O. LODRICK Unlike the early urban civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley, which show a degree of continuity with later cultural traditions in the area, in South Asia a hiatus follows the Harappan civilization. Earlier theories of Aryan invasions accounting for the decline of Harappan civilization have been discounted, and it is more likely that a combination of environmental factors such as climatic change, defor? estation, flooding, salinization of soils as a result of irrigation and, perhaps, seismic activity affecting the course of the Indus River, all contributed to the decline of urban civilization in the Indus Valley.28 Be that as it may, by the middle of the second millennium B.C., the sophisticated, technologically advanced, urban society of northwest South Asia that had rivaled Egypt and Mesopotamia in its achieve? ments, had virtually disappeared. The cities of the region were replaced by agricultural village communities that showed little of the sophisti? cation of their urban predecessors. These communities, however, were supplanted by Aryan-speaking peoples who penetrated the northwestern mountain passes and settled the plains of northwestern India in the early part of the second millennium B.C. Not only did the Aryans bring with them a new language, a new social structure and alien religious and literary tra? ditions, they were pastoral peoples whose livelihood depended on their cattle. In the centuries following ca. 1300 B.C., the poet-priests (Brahmans) of Aryan society composed, in northwestern India, a body of literature that came to be known as the Vedas, the sacred scriptures of Hinduism. Although primarily a body of hymns, poems and sacrificial formulas, the Vedas also reflect the nature of Aryan pastoral society. The cow, the bull and the ox are mentioned more frequently in the Vedic literature than any other species of animal. There is a complex vocabulary (numbering perhaps a couple of dozen words) to differentiate between types of cattle, specialized words indicating heifer, barren cow, cow that has ceased to bear after having one calf, and various types of oxen. In Sanskrit, the word "to fight" means literally "to search for cattle," a very rich man is described as gopati, "lord of cows",29 and cattle and their products are listed in the Vedas as measures of wealth.30 The economic importance of cattle in Aryan society is more than equaled by their ritual and symbolic significance. Sacrifice was the cornerstone of Vedic religion and cattle were the chief sacrificial victims.31 Both the cow and the ox were offered at sacrifices (Rig Veda 8.43.11) and, in contrast to the modern Hindu practice of beef avoidance by the higher castes, the flesh of offerings was consumed</page><page sequence="7">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 67 by the priests. Cow's milk and milk products were used in rituals and offered as oblations to the gods. There are also indications that, towards the end of the Vedic period, cow dung and ghi (clarified butter) were assuming the purificatory role that is important in modern Hinduism.32 The pastoral symbolism evident in the Vedas clearly reflects both the economic and ritual importance of cattle to the Aryan-speaking peoples, identifying the animal with various deities. Dyaus, the great Father of the Indo-Aryan pantheon, is described as "the bull with the thousand horns" who fertilizes Prithivi, the Earth-cow, with the gods and all creatures springing from this union. In the Vedic creation myth, Indra slays Vrata, thus releasing the cosmic waters which come forth like lowing cows (Rig Veda 1.32.2) and give birth to the Sun, bringing moisture, warmth and light into the universe. The Divine Bull, as Indra, impregnates the cows and, as the Sun, is sacrificed to nourish the earth and renew its fecundity.33 Parjanya, Sorna, Agni and Rudra are all Vedic deities who are represented as bull-gods, with aspects of Agni and Rudra merging in the late Vedic period and perhaps evolving into the god Shiva, the great Destroyer of modern Hinduism. The vehicle (vahana) of Shiva is the bull, and images of the bull Nandi are to be found facing the entrance to all Shiva temples in India today. One notable difference in the position of cattle in Vedic and the earlier Harappan society is the rise to preeminence of the cow in its own right during the Vedic period, or at least the presence of evidence of this preeminence. In addition to its obvious economic importance in Vedic India, the cow is presented in the Vedic literature as the supreme symbol of femininity, fecundity, and maternalism and of greater importance, perhaps, then even the bull. Prithivi, the earth and its personification as a goddess, is referred to as the divine cow, and is held to be the mother of the gods; Aditi, the Vedic goddess of space who is also identified with the earth and with Nature is referred to in one passage as the Cosmic Cow; the cosmic waters, released after Indra slays the demon Vrata, come forth lowing like cows; rain cloud are called cows. Surabhi, known also as Kamadhenu, is the wish-fulfilling Cow of Plenty, who symbolizes the abundance and proliferation of Nature, and thus rep? resents both motherhood and regeneration (even today, in India, saddhus [Hindu holy men] wander the country with cows representing Kamadhenu, which are worshipped and venerated by the local people). The frequent and persistent identification of the cow with various deities in the Vedas, especially in the context of sustenance and fertility in the</page><page sequence="8">68 DERYCK O. LODRICK universe, resulted, as W. Norman Brown argues, in the word or words for cow becoming . .a symbol of the holiest of those entities_The metaphor or symbol had run away from those who employed it. They ceased to distinguish it from the objects it had been meant to adorn or represent, and thus the cow had acquired their holiness as a quality of its own."27 Some authors34'35 have suggested the frequent description of the cow as "not to be slain" (aghnya) in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda as indicating a precursor of the concept of the sanctity of the cow. In addition, there is ample evidence in the Vedic literature that the Brah? man's cow was regarded as inviolable (the cow was the typical sacrificial fee for the Brahman's services). However, as Brown27 notes, during the Vedic period the Brahman's cow is sacred and inviolable (to others), not because it was a cow but because it belonged to a Brahman. We concur with Brown's conclusion that, despite the economic and symbolic importance of cattle, and specifically the cow, in Vedic society, there is no evidence from the Vedic period to indicate that the concept of the sanctity of the cow was established at this time. Emergence of the sacred-cow concept While the role of the bull and the cow in ancient eastern Mediterranean fertility cults, as apparent in the Harappan civilization, as well as the economic and symbolic importance of cattle in Vedic India clearly contributed to the subsequent crystallization of the concept of the sanctity of the cow, these are not, by themselves, sufficient to account for the emergence of the concept. This appears to be a later development that follows the appearance and acceptance of the concept of ahimsa in Indian society. The word ahimsa is derived from the Sanskrit verb that means "to kill or damage." Hims is the desiderative form of the verb and the a-prefix negates the meaning of the word that follows, so that ahimsa literally means "renunciation of the desire to kill or to injure." The philosophy of ahimsa, held by some as India's greatest contribution to ethics, has come to be central to the major religious philosophies of South Asia. It is embraced by Hinduism, Buddhism and, particularly, by Jainism.36 Some authors argue that traces of the ahimsa philosophy can be found in the early Vedas31 although the first textual reference to ahimsa does not occur until the end of the Vedic period, when the Chandogya Upanishad (3.17.4) includes ahimsa (harmlessness) in a rather obscure passage listing virtues deemed appropriate to be one's</page><page sequence="9">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 69 gift to the priest. The concept appears nowhere else in the Vedic liter? ature, and this, along with the widespread practice of animal sacrifice and meat-eating, suggests that the doctrine may have non-Vedic origins. Some authorities suggest that the Chinese doctrine of non-violence may have played a significant role in the evolution of ahimsa in India.38 However, in the Indian tradition, ahimsa appears to reflect little of the natural sympathy and compassion upon which the Chinese concept of non-violence was founded. It is primarily a passive philosophy, albeit one that fits well with Indian conceptions of the fundamental unity of life, espoused as a means of avoiding sin (pap) and acquiring merit (punya) rather than an active means of expressing compassion to living creatures. By espousing ahimsa, the individual avoids the accumulation of bad karma and thus hastens one's progress through the cycle of transmigration (samsara) and reincarnation towards ultimate release from the physical world (moksa). As Walker so succinctly writes, "Here is no crusading mission of mercy, no forthright adventure of loving kindness, but a neutral 'aseptic' evacuation from the spirit of the will to hurt."39 Although ahimsa is first mentioned in a Hindu text at the end of the Vedic period (the Chandogya Upanishad is variously dated to the eight to sixth centuries B.C.), it reached its full development in the Buddhist and Jain religions. Ahimsa became central to the teachings of Mahavira (599-527 B.C.), the generally accepted founder of Jainism (the Jains claim a much earlier origin for their religion), and many contemporary Jain customs and practices are rooted in this philosophy. These include vegetarianism, the wearing of masks by monks to prevent the accidental inhalation of insects, avoidance of even certain plants by monks in the name of non-injury, and shunning occupations such as agriculture that might involve the inadvertent destruction of insects. It is not uncommon in Gujarat and other parts of India where Jainism is well entrenched, to see Jaina monks and nuns, dressed in white, wielding brooms and sweeping the road before them as they walk so they do not tread on and destroy insects. The maintenance of animal homes (pinjrapols) where stray, sick and injured animals, and even insects, are given shelter in the name of ahimsa is an integral part of the Jain cultural tradition.40 In terms of numbers, Jains have always formed a relatively insig? nificant element in the population of the Indian subcontinent. However, the ahimsa philosophy was also embraced by Buddhism (in a slightly different manner than Jainism) and when Ashoka Maurya (ca. 269-232 B.C.) converted to Buddhism, he adopted it as the imperial state reli? gion. The tenets of Buddhism were proclaimed throughout the empire,</page><page sequence="10">70 DERYCK O. LODRICK and ahimsa became, in effect, the law of virtually all of India (except the few independent states in the extreme south). Many of Ashoka's proc? lamations were engraved on stone pillars throughout the empire, and two, Rock Edict I and Pillar Edict V, specifically prohibit the slaughter of animals.41 Significantly, perhaps, the long lists of protected animals identified in these edicts make no specific mention of the cow. Another edict, Rock Edict II, indicates that provision was made for the medical treatment of animals and one authority argues that animal hospitals (pinjrapols) date from this time.42 Despite the emergence of ahimsa in the Buddhist tradition and the adoption of Buddhism as the official religion of the Mauryan Empire during the third century B.C., there is little indication that the doctrine had made inroads in Hinduism or had come to be identified specifically with the cow at that time. The Upanishadic period was one of religious ferment and social upheaval, one that saw the rise of heterodoxies such as Jainism and Buddhism that challenged the established Vedic order. In fact, some argue that the principle of ahimsa originated in a rejection of Vedic society and its sacrificial ritual43 or that, by supporting ahimsa and thus negating the need for sacrifice, both ascetics and kshatriyas (the ruling, warrior caste of Vedic society) were undermining Brah manical social and religious domination. Whatever the reason for the acceptance of ahimsa among certain groups in Indian society, it took several centuries for the concept to be accepted within the mainstream of Hindu thinking. Textual references between the fifth century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. suggest that the ahimsa concept and the doctrine of the inviolability of the cow were slowly gaining acceptance in Brahmanical circles, but many references are equivocal and ambivalent, with popular practice apparently being at odds with scriptural teachings. In the Bhagavad Gita (ca. A.D. 300), for instance, ahimsa is mentioned four times (10.5; 13.7; 16.2; 17.14), usu? ally in lists of desirable virtues, but is never elaborated upon, and no mention is made of the inviolability of the cow. Similarly, in the Manu Smriti ("Laws of Manu") (approx. 600 B.C.-approx. A.D. 300) and Kautilya's Arthashastra (approx. 290 B.C.-A.D. 300), some passages espouse ahimsa and the doctrine of the sanctity of the cow, while others casually refer to the slaughter of cattle and the eating of meat. Even though the Brahmanical literature of medieval India (ca. fourth to seventh century) treats the ahimsa concept and the inviolability of the cow as established doctrine, such ideas face popular apathy and resis? tance (for the view that beef-eating was very much a part of early Indian dietary traditions, see Jha44).</page><page sequence="11">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 71 The sacred-cow concept as established doctrine It is not until medieval times that concepts of ahimsa and of the sanctity of the cow are presented as established doctrine in the scriptural texts of Hinduism. The Hindu epic, the Mahabharata (completed around the fourth century A.D.), extols ahimsa and promotes cow worship (Anushasana parvan 76-83). A story related in the Mahabharata (Anushasana parvan 116 42.44; 124 35-40) demonstrates how many elements contributing to the emergence of the sacred-cow concept (identification with deities, motherhood, sustenance, the ritual status of milk, and wealth) had coalesced by this time. After Daksha created living beings, so the story goes, he found them clamoring for food. He therefore drank a cup of nectar (amrii) and out of his mouth came the divine cow Surabhi. She gave birth to a number of tawny daughters (kapila) who, in turn, became mothers. The cows multiplied and their milk provided food for the humans being created by Daksha. Some of the milk fell on the head of Shiva, who grew red with anger and the reflection of his color produced different colors among the cows [an interesting explanation of the color differential between breeds of Bos indicus]. Daksha calmed Shiva by arguing that milk, being nectar, was pure and by the present of a bull to Shiva, who henceforth became Pashupati, the lord of cattle. Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, agreed to reside in the semi-divine cows and so those who tended them were considered blessed in every way.29 In the Puranas (composed between the sixth and sixteenth centuries A.D.), there are numerous references (too many to enumerate) to the cow's sanctity and the doctrine of the sanctity of the cow is presented as established fact. As W. Norman Brown puts it, "The epic, the Puranas, and a great mass of ancillary literature express the idea of the cow's sanctity in the form which modern Hinduism accepts as orthodox, and on their authority the doctrine is so firmly fixed in dogma, whatever the case may be with practice, that it is possible for the modern authority to say that caste, rebirth, and the sanctity of the cow are the principle tenets of modern Hinduism on the popular level."27 It is in the Puranas, too, that we find another instance of the cow as both symbol and sustenance, in association with a popular deity, that has contributed significantly to modern Hindu attitudes and practices associated with the animal. The Pur anas relate the legend of the Hindu god Krishna, whose cult has come to be inseparable from the cow in the Hindu mind. An avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, Krishna first appears as the god-hero of the Mahabharata, the divine charioteer and guide of</page><page sequence="12">72 DERYCK O. LODRICK Arjuna, who reminds his master of the importance of doing his duty (dharma), even though this means fighting against and killing his kins? men (Krishna's arguments are presented in the Bhagavad Gita, a part of the Mahabharata, which is revered by many Hindus as the actual utterance of the Supreme Deity). It is, however, the aspect of Krishna as the Lord of Herdsmen, Krishna Govinda, that is of significance here. The cult of Krishna, which first appears in the region of Mathura, south-east of Delhi, under the Kushans (A.D. 65-225),45 is a devotional (bhakti) movement in which Krishna is inextricably linked with the cow. The Harivamsha Purana and the Bhagavata Purana tell of Krishna's early life among the pastoral peoples of the region, and Krishna himself relates "We are cowherds, wandering in the forests, maintaining our? selves on cows, which are our wealth; cows are our deities..." (Harivamsha Purana 2.16.2). Krishna is revered not only by pastoral groups such as Goalas and Ahirs, but also by vaishyas (the third ["business"] category of the traditional caste or varna system of Hindu society), who are enjoined by the Bhagavad Gita (18.44) to protect cattle. Indeed, the cult of Krishna and reverence for the cow are well entrenched among the business castes of Gujarat and Rajasthan in India today. Certainly, the association of the pastoral Krishna with the cow is one of the most striking in Hindu art.46'47 Krishna playing the flute in front of the cow is a common theme in Indian painting, while friezes of cows are a common motif in pichhavais, the elaborate paintings that are often used as backdrops to religious ceremonies in Vaishnava temples. Pich havais often depict bucolic scenes from Krishna's life, for instance Krishna frolicking with the gopis (cowgirls) or herding cows in the forests of Brindaban, his ancestral home. The identification of Krishna with the cow is further reinforced by the ceremonies and rituals that accompany many Krishna-related festivals celebrated throughout India today.48'49 The question remains as to why and how, if popular practice regarding the sanctity of the cow was at variance with doctrine as presented in medieval Hindu texts, the concept has assumed such a central role in Hinduism. There is no single answer to this question, for it clearly an extremely complex, multi-faceted issue, and there is perhaps no satisfactory, complete answer to the question. Furthermore, one must acknowledge that despite the overarching nature of the concept as a tenet of the Hindu faith, considerable variety exists as to beliefs and practices regarding the cow. There is no monolithic adherence to belief in the sanctity of the cow in Indian society (which includes Muslims,</page><page sequence="13">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 73 Christians and other non-Hindus) or even within the Hindu community. For example, beef-eating is common among low caste Hindus, while adherence to the sacred-cow philosophy is associated primarily with the upper castes (vegetarian practices are often adopted by lower castes in an effort to raise their caste status). In addition, one must also question to what extent the devout Hindu who accepts the sacred-cow concept as a central fact of his faith is aware of, or even cares about, the origins of the concept. We can, however, identify some contributing factors and suggest others that have played a role in the emergence of the concept. As Brown27 has indicated, the concept originates in Indo-Aryan society, although undoubtedly notions with their roots in the cattle cults of the ancient Middle East as well as ancient concepts linking the Mother Goddess with both fertility and the cow have played a role. Suggestions of this are present in Harappan civilization and may also be seen in aspects of modern Hinduism as in the association between Shiva and his bull. Although the concept of the sanctity and inviolability of the cow is absent from Vedic society, there are elements in the Vedas that later coalesce to find expression in the concept: the economic importance of cattle to Vedic society, the significance of cattle in Vedic ritual sacrifice, figurative and literal references to the cow in the Vedas, and the iden? tification of the cow with specific deities and also fertility in Vedic mythology. The doctrine of ahimsa is mentioned in the Upanishads, although it appears to be of non Indo-Aryan origin. Although not initially identified with the cow, it is the specific application of ahimsa to the cow that defines the sacred-cow concept so that by around the fourth century, the doctrine of the sanctity and inviolability of the cow is established doctrine in the Hindu scriptures. B.R. Ambedkar50 provides one scenario by which popular practice is brought into line with scriptural doctrine in the early centuries of the Christian era. He suggests that, in the context of the struggle between Buddhism and Hinduism for the allegiance of the local population at this time, Brahmanical Hinduism co-opted the predominantly Buddhist concept of ahimsa and applied it specifically to the cow, an animal which was not only of considerable economic importance in the India of the time, but which also occupied an significant place in the traditions and mythology of Hinduism. That they succeeded is reflected, in part, in the decline of Buddhism and the resurgence of Hinduism during this period. Thus, there is a political dimension to the emergence of the sacred-cow concept. That the political aspect of the concept is not insignificant is seen in later centuries. The rise in popularity of the sacred-cow concept</page><page sequence="14">74 DERYCK O. LODRICK has been interpreted by some as a response to the Muslim invasions of the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. Identification with the sanctity of the cow was seen as a commitment to the Hindu faith in the face of Muslim dominance in India. Certainly, the Rajput clans of Rajasthan who re? sisted the Muslim invaders at this time are popularly seen as defending Hinduism and its tenets against the foreign invaders,51 while protection of the cow, of the Brahmans and observance of caste rules was a central issue for Shivaji (1627-1680), the Maratha chieftan who led the 17th century Hindu renaissance against Muslim rule in the Indian subcon? tinent.52 Almost three centuries later, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (the Mahatma ["Great Soul"]) utilized the cow as a political symbol in his nonviolent struggle for independence from British rule. But, for Gandhi, political freedom without spiritual freedom was meaningless, and the latter was to be sought in the teachings of the ancient Hindu sages. Gandhi wrote: "The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection. Cow protec? tion. . .takes the human being beyond his species. The cow to me means the entire subhuman world_Cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the entire world. Hindus will be judged by.. .their ability to protect the cow."53 Thus for Gandhi, even though the sanctity of the cow and cow protection served a political purpose, i.e. an identification with Hindu values and opposition to the occupying colonial power, the sanctity of the cow was primarily a philosophical and spiritual phenomenon (for a discussion of Gandhi's view of cow-protection in the context of animal husbandry, see Florence Burgat.54) However, the political significance of the cow was further exploited by the Congress Party in independent India by its adoption of the cow and suckling calf as the symbol of the party (extremely important for an electorate that was essentially illiterate and that often voted by identifying with symbols). There are clearly other factors that help explain, and reinforce, the emergence of the doctrine of the sacred-cow and that also throw light on the complex and multi-faceted nature of its place in Hindu society. For instance, the cult of the cow was central to the teachings of Vallabha (1479-1531), also known as Vallabacharya, who founded the Hindu sect known as the "Pushti Marg", a devotional (bhakti) movement wor? shipping Krishna that is popular in areas of western India.55 Many contemporary rituals involving Krishna and the cow are associated with the temples and devotees of this movement. Alternatively, some</page><page sequence="15">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 75 scholars argue that class conflicts over cattle and the use of cattle by village elites to expropriate surplus from the poor help explain the entrenchment of the sacred-cow concept in Indian culture, and thus that political considerations, both at the local and (historically) national levels, account for its role in Indian society. Others have invoked eco? nomic, psychoanalytical and even phenomenological approaches to explain the sacred-cow concept.57 The cow as symbol: A social science paradigm India's sacred cow became a symbol of another sort in the 1960s, a symbol of competing intellectual and methodological philosophies that came to be known as the "sacred-cow controversy." The controversy was initiated by anthropologist Marvin Harris who, in two articles published in 196558 and 1966,59 challenged the prevailing conventional wisdom that India's sacred-cow concept was essentially religious in nature. He wrote: "I have written this paper because I believe the irrational, non-eco? nomic, and exotic aspects of the Indian cattle complex are greatly overemphasized at the expense of rational, economic and mundane interpretations. My intent is ... to urge that the explanation of taboos, customs, and rituals associated with the management of Indian cattle be sought in "positive-functioned" and probably "adaptive" processes of the ecological system of which they are part, rather than in the influence of Hindu theology."59 To fully understand the significance of Harris's publications and their consequences, one must be aware not only of Harris's aims in writing his articles but also the broader intellectual and social context (particularly in the United States) of the time. Harris, one of the most prominent contributors to 20th-century anthropological theory, was the originator of cultural materialism, a theoretical paradigm and research strategy that sought to provide causal explanations for differences and similarities in cultural behavior. Cultural materialism essentially holds that a society is shaped by its material base, which in turn is determined by a complex of ecological, environmental, technological and demo? graphic variables (for an elaboration of cultural materialism, see Harris 197960). Thus Harris, who readily admitted to not being a South Asian</page><page sequence="16">76 DERYCK O. LODRICK specialist, was utilizing the sacred-cow concept as a paradigm to vali? date his theoretical ideas, something he continued to do later in his career with other cultural phenomena.61-63 Moreover, during the 1960s, ecology and environmental studies were becoming increasingly in vogue in both popular and academic circles. Although its roots lie much earlier, the environmental movement in the US received tremendous impetus from the publication of two works which seized the popular imagination, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring64 and the reissue of Aldo Leopold's The Sand County Almanac.65 American colleges and universities, in response to demands from stu? dents for relevance in the curriculum, began to offer courses in ecology and environmental studies. (This author can attest that during the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the department in which he taught, courses with "Ecology" in the title consistently garnered the highest student enrollments.) The study of ecology was also receiving serious attention by academics as more than just a life science phenomenon, but rather as a conceptual context in which to examine human cultures. Julian Steward had laid the foundations of cultural ecology in his Theory of Culture Change in 195566 and anthropologists such as Robert Netting, Roy Rapport and John Bennett were further defining the boundaries of the field in the 1960s.67-69 It was also during the 1960s that the Indian subcontinent experienced a number of failed monsoons, and severe droughts in 1966-1968 led to widespread famine and over 1.5 million deaths (further food scarcity was avoided only by massive imports of food grains [10,000,000 tonnes of wheat in 1966 alone] from the US under Public Law 480 during these years). It was thus quite under? standable that issues such as the putative inefficiency of the Indian agricultural economy, numbers of surplus and useless cattle, and com? petition between cattle and humans for scarce resources should assume a high profile at this time. Harris's publications elicited an immediate and vocal reaction from scholars from many disciplines. His ideas, or at least his interpretation of various aspects of India's cattle complex, received some support, mainly from economists and those working in the field of develop? ment.70-74 However, anthropologists and others criticized Harris' position on theoretical grounds.56'75-78 Some scholars, such as anthro? pologists Stanley and Ruth Freed, presented field data from India as evidence that Harris' technoenvironmental determinism was flawed, arguing that "emotion, belief and attitude profoundly influence human behavior."79 But perhaps the most effective rebuttal of Harris's position was presented by Frederick Simoons,80 a cultural geographer</page><page sequence="17">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 77 with wide-ranging interests in cattle and milking practices in the Old World and field experience in India. Simoons questioned not only the reductive Marxist underpinnings of Harris's interpretation of cultural ecology, but his historical accuracy and also his explanation of specific issues such as the existence of surplus cattle in India or whether attitudes towards cattle create inefficiencies in the Indian economy. As Simoons writes, "My position is that the proper framework in which to place the sacred-cow controversy is one which permits traits to be positive functioned, negative-functioned, or both and which allows for human choice among alternative cattle policies and systems."80 This writer's own research on cattle in India36,40'81 suggests that there are indeed "negative-functioned" traits originating in spiritual values that contra? dict Harris's cultural materialistic view of the sacred-cow concept of India. But, as Odend'hal has aptly pointed out, the outcome of the sacred-cow controversy no doubt means very little to the average Indian villager who derives his livelihood from agriculture in the subcontinent.82 The cow in modern India Despite tremendous growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors of the Indian economy in recent decades, agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy. Some 70% of the country's 1.2 billion population lives in villages; India maintains some 220 million cattle, approximately 15% of the world's total cattle population; and agriculture accounts for 33% of the country's GDP. Milk and milk products are a major element in the diet of the Indian population (for a discussion of the role of cow vs. buffalo milk in India see Hoffpauir83). Cattle are a major source of traction while cow dung provides perhaps 20% (in some localities as much as 50%) of the energy consumed in rural areas. It is difficult to overstate the importance of cattle to the Indian economy. However, beyond the economic value of cattle or the ecological issues raised by those involved in the sacred-cow debate, e.g. whether a surplus of useless cattle is detrimental to the Indian economy or whether cattle compete with humans for scarce resources in India today, there exists the very real role that the cow plays in the religious and spiritual life of Hindus in India today (for an interesting discussion of the sym? bolic role of the cow vis-?-vis the buffalo in India, see Gerard Toffin84). Cow worship, cattle-related rituals associated with festivals such as Gopashtami and Goverdhan Puja,4SA9 the ritual and purificatory role of</page><page sequence="18">78 DERYCK O. LODRICK dung and other products of the cow, beef avoidance, and institutions dedicated to the preservation of cattle and other animals 40all form part of the cultural landscape of modern India. Understanding the sacred cow concept and all its ramifications is integral to understanding the nature of contemporary Hindu society,86 especially in the light of recent social and political developments (see S.M. Batra87 and also a volume of Seminar** devoted to such issues). Following independence from British rule in 1947, India adopted a secular form of government. Though attempts by what Simoons has called "Hindu loyalists"89 to give a ban on cow-slaughter (based partly on economic and partly on religious grounds) legal status in the new Constitution were defeated, a compromise was reached whereby a ban on cow-slaughter was included in the "directive principles of state policy" section of the Constitution. The directives had no legal status, but set out fundamental principles that governments (including those of the Indian states) should follow in writing their laws, and many states in India have, in fact, passed legislation imposing some type of ban on cow-slaughter. In many instances, however, these have fallen short of the total ban favored by Hindu loyalists and periodically episodes of violence over cow slaughter erupt in India.90 One only has to peruse the press in India to read about numerous instances in which sentiment against cow-slaughter results in civil disturbances and even killings. In October 2002, for example, an incident occurred in Haryana in which some Jats (a traditional warrior caste of India), seeing their traditional role as kshatriyas as involving protection of the cow, lynched five Dalits ("untouchables") who were alleged to have skinned a cow alive (it should be noted that skinning carcasses of cattle is a traditional occu? pation of the untouchable castes in India). As recently as 2004, The Times of India (February 4, 2004) reported a riot in Madhya Pradesh over the slaughter of a bullock. The issue of cow protection as national policy re-emerged recently with changes in the national political scene. The Congress Party, with its commitment to a secular state, held the reins of the central government in India for virtually all of the first 50 years of the country's existence. However, recent decades have seen the rise of the Hindutva movement in India. Hindutva or "Hinduness" has been presented as a way of life or state of mind rooted in the central beliefs of the Hindu religion. Although the term dates back to the 1920s and was used to describe movements advocating Hindu nationalism, the philosophy began to gain widespread support in India after 1989, possibly as a consequence of events in Kashmir that saw nearly half a million Hindus driven from</page><page sequence="19">CATTLE IN SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE 79 their homes by the activities of Muslim fundamentalists. Hindutva was embraced by political parties opposed to the Congress, most notably the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was formed in 1980 as a successor to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS). Incidents such as that at Ayodhya in 1992 (the demol? ishing by Hindu fundamentalists of a disused mosque thought to be built on the site of the Hindu god Ram's birth) created increasing support for the BJP, which gradually expanded its presence in state and national assemblies. Following a brief (13-day) stint in power in 1996, the BJP returned to power in Delhi at the head of a leftist coalition in 1998. In the spring of 2004, the lower house of the Indian legislature (Lok Sabha), with the support of the BJP, adopted a non-binding res? olution seeking a national ban on cow-slaughter while the BJP gov? ernment itself considered proposing formal legislation on the issue. This was never done, and in May 2004 the BJP alliance suffered a shock electoral defeat and resigned from power. The outgoing Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani cited, rightly or wrongly, neglect of Hindutva as among the reasons for the government's defeat (for a study of the role of cow-protection in Hindu nationalism, see Therese O'Toole91). Conclusions Nowhere in the world are attitudes, beliefs and practices associated with cattle as complex as in South Asia. The Indian farmer who depends on his cattle for his livelihood, the village housewife who spreads purifying cow-dung (gobar) on her hearth at the time of Govardhan Puja, the businessman who performs the cow-worship ceremony (go-puja) at Gopashtami, the priests who feed milk to the idol of Krishna at certain times of day at Vaishnava temples, the devout Hindu who supports aged, non-productive cows out of respect for "Mother Cow" and as an alternative to slaughter, the politicians who promote cow-protection to demonstrate their "Hinduness" - all act in a cultural context that places great emphasis on and is circumscribed by the concept of the sanctity and inviolability of the cow. Cattle and the cow are of great economic importance to the Indian economy and people, but they also of considerable symbolic significance in the context of the Hindu religion and society. They thus assume the roles of both sustenance and symbol, though the duality of this heuristic device does not come close to doing justice to the complexity of the roles cattle and the cow play and have played in Indian society. From the</page><page sequence="20">80 DERYCK O. LODRICK Paleolithic artists who left evidence of the impression the wild aurochs made on the primitive human mind, to the scholars who debate the nature of the sacred-cow concept, the role of cattle as both symbol and sustenance intermingle in a manner yet to be fully described. This paper has outlined the various elements that have contributed to the development of modern attitudes and practices surrounding cattle in South Asia. While these are essentially Indian in origin and are deeply rooted in Indian culture and history, they also include contributing factors that are external in nature. Elements of the ancient cattle cults of the Middle East can be traced through the Harappan civilization and into modern India. The early farmers on the eastern margins of Southwest Asia who domesticated the zebu's ancestors laid the foun? dations for India's agricultural wealth and the economy of nearly one fifth of the world's population today. Aryans originating in central Asia introduced a social structure and developed a religious system which provided the basis for modern Hindu society. The ahimsa concept, which subsequently was absorbed and integrated in the philosophies and world view of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, appears to be of non-Indian origin. All these elements contribute to the emergence of a philosophy whose presence is further enhanced by religious, social, and even political conflict. The end result is a commitment by Hindu society to a doctrine that sets parameters for patterns of behavior in India today. Whether India continues as a secular state or whether Hindu nationalism prevails, "Mother Cow" and the attitudes and practices associated with cattle in India function in a cultural context that has roots deep in South Asia's past, and they will continue to remain a defining feature of Indian culture and society.
