<plain_text><page sequence="1">Insect Behavioral Ecology-'79 1 Introduction INSECT BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY: COMING OF AGE IN BIONOMICS OR COMPLEAT BIOLOGISTS HAVE REVOLUTIONS TOO' JAMES E. LLOYD Department of Entomology and Nematology University of Florida Gainesville, FL 32611 "You could feel the presence of nineteenth-century museum directors engaged, in their frock coats, in goniometrie and craniologie, busily collecting and measuring everything, in the pious hope that mere quantification would lead to understanding." (Sagan 1979) A little more than a year ago I had never heard of the expression be- havioral ecology. I had at that time concluded, after years of not fitting into any of the nominate subdisciplines of biology, that I had more in common with whooping cranes than cattle egrets. Upon discovering a symposium vol- ume entitled Behavioral Ecology (Krebs and Davies 1978) I knew that my combination of biological interests was not a sterile chimera, or at least I was not alone. Behavioral ecology is a hybrid. According to Wilbur (1979) it happened this way: Ecology and genetics began hybridizing almost a half century ago, and then ecological genetics backerossed with ecology. The result, population biology, began progressive introgression into ethology during the past decade, resulting in what some call sociobiology. What others have called the latter should not be printed here, but sociobiology and behavioral ecology are about the same. I find 2 noteworthy distinctions: In behavioral ecology one is not expected to have an academic or theoretical opinion on human sexual be- havior; and secondly, one need not admire or even profess interest in social Hymenoptera. Wilbur's geneology for behavioral ecology may be historically correct, but had Darwin been properly introduced to Mendel's replicators the path would have been direct. As a recognized subject area, behavioral ecology was born during an incredibly exuberant theoretical period spermed on by George Williams' (1966) critique of the then "current evolutionary thought." It is now enter- ing an intensive animal-watching, hypothesis-testing phase, in the true and best tradition of Darwin's hypothetico-deductive method (Ghiselin 1969). A revolution, ultimately of more import than those following dis- covery of background-microwave-radiation by astrophysicists and helical molecules by biochemists, and it is ours!

Their professional employ- ment in what often amounts to applied insect behavioral ecology, provides unique and enviable physical and technical advantages. This can be the decade of the insect, and it can continue our current compensation for past leadership and domination of theoretical biology by patrons of an ossified aristocracy. Behavioral ecology's most distinctive mark is the central position natural selection theory plays in the interpretation and analysis of animal (and plant) outdoor behavior, this theory having been correctly termed biology's cogent paradigm (Barash 1977). A critic may ask, "But is not selective thinking simply your current cogent paradigm? Won't it too pass and be replaced like Lamarckism and mutationism in their time?" When selective thinking is replaced it will be because of the ascendency of theory that it itself has birthed. The midwives will be behavioral ecologists. Biologists may have taken a long time to apply the same logic to their subjects that their cultural antecedents did when they manipulated the heredity of hunting hounds and fighting crickets, but selective thinking is the real Solomon's Ring, and it will endure in some form. In the insect bionomics business selective thinking makes predictions (induces hypotheses) as to what should and should not be expected to occur in biological systems. In agriculture it could even be called long-term-insect- management thinking, or insect-management-thinking for tomorrow. Selec- tive thinking would have predicted that resistance was likely in barn flies of the fifties, and that screwworms raised in warm factories might not be competitive on cool country mornings in Texas (Bush 1978), or that females will eventually discriminate against sterile males, turning on only to wild ones. For practical purposes we need not worry if selection theory is "real fact" any more than the chemist worries whether his Haworth molecular mnodel reflects a Universal truth. Pragmatism is as fundamental to behavioral ecology as it is to applied entomology. The latter is practical in its purpose and choice of goals and problems, the former in its methodology and termi- nology. Behavioral ecology takes natural selection for granted, leaving the fretting over old arguments, and the making of new ones from them, to taxonomic nomenclaturists and philosophers. We don't need to prove natural selection anymore (see Maynard Smith 1978). Consequently, we expect or- ganisms to be adapted. When an insect is seen doing something, apply a "unified-field-optimality-theory": More often than not wlhen you observe an insect in the field, what it is doing at the moment is the best thing it can possibly be doing at that moment for maximizing its long-run reproduction. I would not bet against adaptation with my own money. (However, I insist on evidence that a biologist really knows what the organism is actually doing -what the adaptation is. This, and not adaptation has been and continues to be the real question.) As a null hypothesis, and the adaptationist's equivalent of the geneticist's Hardy-Weinberg Law, an organism can even be presumed to be perfectly adapted. With knowledge of organisms, biological economics, and engineering, the approach can then be to prove otherwise, quantify, re- evaluate, and begin afresh.</page><page sequence="3">Insect Behavioral Ecology-'79 3 Two features of behavioral ecology may deter or distress, and they re- quire some explanation. Behavioral ecology employs models-word models, game models, mathematical models-it even seems to substitute them for reality in absurd oversimplifications. These are but conceptual tools intended to cope with an unreasonable, indescribable, natural world. A model may provide a point of view that is totally new, and permit escape from past prejudices that have become dead ends. Consider, for example, the sequence 2 3 6 7 1 9 4 5 8. What is the rule that orders these numbers? . . . The rule and its execution are elementary (first grade), but who would think of a numerical arrangement being alphabetical? Now when I present the numer- ical sequence 1 6 2 4 8 5 7 3 2 you have numerical and alphabetical solutions in mind, and are probably looking for some totally different perspective as well. A second criticism concerns terminology and mode of expression. Teleol- ogy and anthropomorphism appear rife. Bees not only have sisters, cousins and nieces, but crickets and digger wasps have strategies, a bug demands, like some errant macho Californian, proof of his fatherhood before paying out paternity benefits, and rapists and transvestites are described from Mecoptera. Insects sometime seem to have been endowed with human cogni- tive power, and scientific papers seem to read like awardees from "a worst from Reader's Digest" contest. This is but time- and space-saving shorthand, and fun. In the recent past, the avoidance of such mild (but technically ex- travagant) expression has been a fetish in biology. Perhaps because of earlier sins behaviorists have felt they needed purity of expression to main- tain scientific credibility and dignity. Perhaps they had little else they could be sure of in their investigation of behavior and they made the most of what they had. Or, perhaps because they focused on proximate problems, not evolutionary ones that were remote from wiring and machinery, such ac- curacy was imperative. It really makes no difference anymore. The alterna- tive to this verbal economy is coinage of new terms (=jargon and profes- sional isolation) with definitions specifying that each applies to organisms other than man, and frequent and drawn-out explanations in the passive voice of selective pressures and how ancestors succeeded and others failed resulting in allelic substitutions and p and q changes, etc., etc., etc ..... Mis- understanding resulting from present laxity is among the least of a student's worries. What harm is done if I speak of a firefly thinking, or blowing his little mind? If a reader can't translate, and tell from text what the long story is, then the problem is not one of diction, and it runs too deeply to be bridged in an extra sentence or word substitution. Catching an author in a conceptual error of substance is more productive and enjoyable, and has greater reward, than complaining that he speaks of his insects with terms appropriate to little people. Perhaps he has found that his flies are more agreeable than most people, and seem, more often, to know what they are about. The members of this Symposium are among the most energetic, interest- ing, and cooperative biologists that a moderator/editor could hope to work with, and I thank them for making my part so easy and enjoyable. Some travelled considerable distance at their own expense to present their invita- tional papers at the Society's annual meeting, and Entomology at large is the beneficiary. Their collective effort is a stimulating and significant con-</page><page sequence="4">4 Florida Entomologist 63(1) March 1980 tribution for the instruction of all entomologists from 4-H to Professor Emeritus rank, and will perhaps stimulate others to produce such mini-texts. These papers were written to be read with ease by any scientist or educated layman, and technical details and asides have, for the most part, been placed in appended notes. At the annual fall meeting of the Society in 1980 another symposium on insect behavioral ecology will be presented. Each participant has paper-bound copies of the entire Symposium for distribution, and persons wanting a copy of all papers need ask but one par- ticipant. Each has separates of his own paper. I thank the Executive Committee and the Program Committee of the Society for their enthusiastic cooperation, guidance, and financial support. I also thank various individuals for reviewing and making helpful suggestions on manuscripts. I especially wish to thank Norm Leppla, Carol Musgrave Sutherland, John Sivinski, Tom Walker, and Dan Wojcik. LITERATURE CITED BARASH, D. P. 1977. Sociobiology and behavior.
