<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art &amp; Technology by Robert E. Ehle Dr. Ehle is Assistant Director of the School of Music , University of Northern Colorado at Greeley, and a member of the AMT Editorial Committee. ONE shaped preoccupied of the much basic my of my thinking themes writing that and is that has has preoccupied my thinking and has shaped much of my writing is that of the relationship between art and technology. For those of us in the arts, we are usually aware that, although all of us use technology constantly in our work, there is a qualitative difference between it and our art. I used to try to explain the difference as being one of means versus ends. Technology is the means, art is the end; we use technol- ogy to deliver art. More recently, though, I have come to revise this evaluation of the distinc- tion and have come to see art, too, as a means, if of a different sort. The end, the only one, from a human point of view, is mankind. The arts exist to serve mankind and technology does, too. This is beginning to sound too anthropomorphic, now, and that is not what I intend. My latest concept of the situation is simply that everything Man does is an extension of human senses and facilities. This includes all of tech- nology and also includes art. Art, like technology, allows a human being to experience and control a wider range of experiences and activities and thus serves Man's need to know, to experi- ence and to control. First, some examples: radio permits us to hear at a great distance; television permits us to see at a great distance. Likewise, the phonograph allows us to hear at great time lapses; the motion pictures enable us to see after great time lapses. In a similar way, books enable us to know things over great stretches of time. They extend the reach of our brains into times long past. Less obvi- ous, perhaps, but just as clear are the use of the telescope to see over great ranges of space or the radiotélescope to hear or see likewise. The microscope allows us to see things beyond our nor- mal range of vision, but in the other direction. The electron microscope takes us even further in this direction. The jet plane allows us to experience a range of territory beyond that which was formerly available to us, thus mak- ing possible our objective of mapping the world in each of our brains. For some of us, the mapping of the uni- verse is a practical objective, made possible through satellites, spacecraft and astronomical instruments. One can go on cataloguing the devices of technology to show how each is an extension of our senses or our limbs. For example, the radar allows us to see a large territory, the X- ray allows us to see through solid objects, the sonar allows us to hear through the oceans, the telephone allows us to both talk and listen over distances. Similarly, the robot allows us to extend our tactile control in areas where human presence is not practical; missiles and weapons, for all their oner- ous qualities, allow us to extend the force of our arms well beyond the nor- mal human range. To put this discussion in a concise theoretical framework, we can say that the human brain is helpless and totally isolated without the interface with the world that occurs through the senses and the limbs and other appendages of the human body. They are our contact with reality and we come to know reality through this contact. All of which brings us to music and the other arts. These things, too, are extensions of our senses, our limbs, and our perceptions, only of a different type. In much the same way that radio allows us to hear things at a distance and the phonograph allows us to hear things through time, music allows us to feel and to perceive feelings expressed through distance and time. Likewise, painting and sculpture allow us to achieve the same in the visual sphere. Dance portrays feelings of movement through space and time, and even cooking can express aspects of a cul- tural feeling through space and time by means of recipes and traditional ingre- dients. In other words, we can view the arts as extensions of our sensations that allow us to perceive the qualities of cul- tures, civilizations and feelings of indi- viduals through space and time. In this way, the arts resemble technologies. Likewise, the arts may be allied with technologies to achieve even more remarkable range. The combination of the poet and the printing press is pow- erful, indeed. The combination of the composer and the orchestra is no less potent. Then add the recording and the radio broadcast and we see how the feelings of a seventeenth-century com- poser may be distributed to virtually the entire population of the twentieth-cen- tury world. Stages in the process include the pen, the manuscript, the printing press, the archive, the orches- tra, the recording and the broadcast. All of these are technological steps that make it possible for us to relive the experience, say, of Monteverdi's Orfeo. So much for the similarities between art and technology. They should be clear enough at this point; still, I am sure that the reader objects that there are major differences, as well. Of course there are, but what are they? It seems clear to me that the fundamental difference is that with technology the process takes place outside of the human perceptions; with the arts, the first step in the process of extension takes place within the human percep- tions. To take the same example cited ear- lier, Monteverdi's Orfeo; before the technology of the pen was brought into play, the process we call "composing" had to take place. This stage involves the metamorphosing of ideas, con- cepts, feelings and perceptions into the shape of a composition. Once encoded this way, the resulting document may be transmitted through all sorts of tech- 34 THE AMERICAN MUSIC TEACHER</page><page sequence="2">nological processes, such as the ones listed previously. The mysterious part of the process is the first part: the encod- ing that we call composition. In this stage of the process we understand that the composer is able to capture: 1) the dramatic argument of the particular situation embodied by the idea of the composition, 2) the style and feeling for sound characteristic of the composer and his particular time, 3) a feeling for the spirit of the culture of a particular time, and particularly, 4) personal expressions and feelings of a particular human individual at a particular time and place in history. All of this is remarkable, to say the least. The same type of metamorphosing takes place in all of the other arts, of course. Some of it happens con- sciously and deliberately, others of it happens unconsciously and automati- cally in a way that had to happen because the artist was a particular per- son who lived at a particular time and place. Still, the encoding takes place, and it is this encoding that permits us to experience the cultures of other times and places through the eyes, ears and brains of some of the most sensitive and perceptive individuals from those cultures, the artists. I hope to have shown that art is, like technology, a transmission medium, and that it is, also likewise, an exten- sion of our own senses. It is, like tech- nology, a channel through which we perceive and experience and from which we can know more about who we are and where we come from. In my own mind, this fact emphasizes the importance of understanding that art and technology form a partnership of exceedingly great importance in our world. In the communication from human to human, art and technology together forge the links that bind us together. Both are necessary. Art with- out technology is virtually impotent. Technology without art is coarse and vulgar and can destroy us. Only together is it possible for the human race to understand itself, essentially to understand the humanness of all mem- bers of the hu man race and to be able to identify all of the others as being like ourselves. When we experience the others' feelings through artistic expres- sions, perhaps we can identify with the others' hopes and fears and better know how much they are basically like us.
