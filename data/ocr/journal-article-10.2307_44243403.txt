<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIENTAL ORIGINS OF JANUS AND HERMES By Phyllis Ackerman Janus, the Roman god for whom Janu- ary was named, has remained something of a mystery. According to the Romans themselves, he was an indigenous divin- ity without Greek counterpart,1 the first king in Italy; similarly, modern scholars have been practically unanimous that he had no Greek parallel, and almost as con- certed in denying Oriental origins. Yet his most conspicuous feature, multiple 1.

Standard Roman practises were also 2. Macrobius, Saturnalia, L. I, cap. VIII.</page><page sequence="2">FOR IRANIAN ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 217 flouted in the character of his places of worship, for most of these, including the most important, in the Forum, were not temples according to the established plans, but merely archways. These might be either a simple arch with two faces, like the bifrons form of the god, or a cross-arch, hence with four faces, corre- sponding to the quadrifrons version of the deity. The one in the Forum, known as Janus geminus, was evidently first bi- frons , facing east and west; but it was reconstructed as quadrifrons , to accord with a quadrifrons statue of the god brought from Falerii after the Roman conquest of the city (241 B.C.). Janus' functions likewise show appar- ent contradictions. He appears chiefly as god of doorways- not the actual door but the passageway3- and of travellers, pre- sumably in relation especially to the mo- ment of departure from, and return to the house entrance. The pair of keys which is his most constant attribute is re- lated to these responsibilities, as is the short staff which he often carries, like that of the Roman porter or "janitor", a term identical in origin with the name Janus. As Janus Portumnus he appears as har- bor patron, and the reason for that con- nection has been much disputed by Clas- sicists, who have been equally active in advancing and rejecting the explanation which might seem obvious : that a harbor was an entrance to a sea-coast city like a door to a house ; or that harbors were the point of departure and return for trav- ellers. But whatever the reason for his mari- time interests, Janus would in all these functions be a relatively unimportant, more or less personal or domestic divin- 3. J. Toutain, Janus, in C. Daremberc- E. Saglio, Dictionnaire des antiquités grecques et romaines, III, Paris, 1896, p. 610; but B. R. Bur- chett, Janus in Roman life and cuit, Menasha, Wis. (for the University of Pennsylvania), 1918, passim, seems to regard Janus as primarily the numen of the dooitas such. ity. Yet in many, perhaps most invoca- tions in which the roll of the gods was called, he was named first, before even Jupiter himself. To explain this as a cor- ollary of his door guardianship, as a rec- ognition that he watched over the en- trance to the gods, seems a bit far fetched. Even granting, however, the pos- sibility that the Roman religion was shaped by such literary analogies, the theory would not explain the concomi- tant fact that he was accounted the source and origin of all things,4 and the power which controlled the succession of the seasons.0 When his head appears on coins there is often a crescent beside it, and he is sometimes crowned with a crescent.6 In one class of representations he is accompanied by a little boy, the great bearded man in striking contrast to the tiny child or baby. It is usually assumed that this expresses his relation to time and the cycle of the seasons, the baby being the New Year. The thread of coherence through these apparent inconsistencies has usually been sought by modern scholars in the notion that Janus was the god of begin- nings. As the first king in Italy, he repre- sented the beginning of that institution. The door is the beginning of the house, and his place of worship was an arch be- cause that was the ancient form of door. It was the beginning of journeys over which he first watched. The harbor is another entrance, hence beginning. He was the Creator only as the beginning, 4. Varro and Quintillian quote verses celebrat- ing Janus, the lanuli , which were already in their time unintelligible even to priests, so ancient was the form of the language; but part of them can be interpreted, and in one passage Janus is ad- dressed as "good creator": see Burchett, op. cit., p. 6.

An adjective occasionally applied to him, matutinus , shows that he also marked the beginning of the day.7 The scheme is neat, but by that very token suspect. Such tidy outlines are Fig. la, b BRONZE VOTIVE FIGURINES PRESUMABLY PHOENICIAN more often produced in the academic study than in the processes of history, and the idea of initiation which is here offered as the common factor in Janus' diverse activities is a highly abstract de- duction, subsequent logically, and almost certainly also in time, to the practical concerns which made up the concrete personality of the god. 7. For characteristic statements of this inter- pretation see W. F. Otto, Janus, in G. Wissowa - W. Kroll (Eds.), Paulys Real-Encyclopädie, Supplementband III, Stuttgart, 1918, pp. 117, 37-1177,48; or Smith- Marindin, op. cit., p. 456. Linguistic support, also, for this thesis has been sought in the theory that the name comes from a word for "going" (Old Indian, yana) ; for the most recent statement assuming this see: F. Alt- heim, A history of Roman religion, New York, 1937, pp. 134, 194. Macrobius (loc. cit.) also gives a derivation from a participial form of "to go" ( eundus , Eanus, Janus), attributing the opinion chiefly to Cicero, as reported by Cornificius, Ety- mologia, III; but the interpretation is entirely different, the assumption being that the verb refers to the constant movement of the earth in a circle, hence means that Janus was an Earth or Sky god. Moreover, philologists have already undermined the ingenious theory from the linguistic angle. For it was builded on the assumption that the proper name Janus came from the common noun janua , "a door" ; but it is now widely con- ceded that the sequence of derivation was in the opposite direction: the door was named for the god. The god's name, in turn, came ultimately from In do- Ary an linguistic sources, represented in the word dius from the root di, meaning "bright", "shining".8 This was the char- acteristic designation of the Sky god, and gave rise to the names of other Sky gods who retained this status, Zeus and Jove. Janus is a normal corruption of Dianus; Zeus an equally normal corruption in an- other line of descent paralleling 66 deus" (which persisted as the common noun for "god" in Latin ) ; and in an older form Zan, which coincides with Dian, older form of Janus; Jove was Diovis, another version; and all reflect a relation accord- ing to recognized linguistic laws to dius. Janus, then, was the god of the bright sky, and that explains much. But could his descent have been direct from In do- Aryan sources to the early cultures with- in Italy itself? As a matter of fact, Janus did have a Greek parallel, and this was one of the most ancient divinities in the Greek pan- theon - Hermes. This related divinity car- ries the genealogy much further back than is possible with Janus himself, and also fills out the picture of the original conception. Hermes was equated by the Romans themselves with Mercurius: both were messengers, were patrons of trade, and in- cidentally, by a suggestive association, of thieves and trickery in general. But this 8. Toutain, loc. cit., citing a half dozen prede- cessors; and J. G. Frazer, The Magic Art, The Golden Bough, II, London, 1911, pp. 384-5 (who points out that Varro speaks of Janus as a Sky god) ; or more briefly: idem, in his Appendix to Ovid's Fasti, London-New York (Loeb Classical Library), 1931, p. 388. *</page><page sequence="4">FOR IRANIAN ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 219 transfer does not exhaust the problem of Hermes, and the Romans' knowledge of the history of their own religion was by no means complete. The original Hermes was a great deal more than a messenger and patron of merchants and thieves. Nor was he the of the single encircled snake of Janus, he has a pair of symmetrically intertwined snakes, the caduceus, and the Oriental origin which Macrobius avers for Janus' snake emblem, is proven for Hermes, for the "caduceus"9 and related serpent em- blems had a long history in the East.

He was, like Janus, a bearded man, but that would not be significant since early ideas of celestial dignity required that the gods be bearded, as some of them, notably Zeus, remained throughout their history. What is significant, however, is that one class of representations in both Greece and Gaul shows Hermes as multi- ple visaged: less often with two, but com- monly with three or four faces. In place If the agreement in multiple heads and Oriental snake emblem were coincidence, that would be beyond the expectations of probability. But the parallel continues. For Hermes, too, was a door guardian. Before innumerable private houses in Athens stood his representation, and it appeared also before temple doors and 9. The famous example is the stone cup of Gudea from Lagash, many times illustrated: see, for example: 0.

Furthermore, again like Janus, he watched over travellers, and the roads that they traversed were marked with his effigies. Again, he shared Janus' patronage of harbors. In addition to his work as messenger, he also served at an early period as usher, and this is the work of a doorman, whether on Olympus or in Rome or Athens. When he did not have the caduceus, he usually carried a short staff, either plain, like Janus', or with a symbolic finial. This finial often takes the form of a crescent. Finally like Janus, Hermes is frequently accompanied by a little child, as he is in the familiar rendi- tion of Praxiteles, though that has in every other respect departed far from the God's origins. These nine major points of correspon- dence (multiple visages, snake emblem, door association, patronage of travellers, of harbors, doorkeeper-usher, staff, cres- cent, association with little boy or infant) prove beyond reasonable cavil an inti- mate connection between Janus and the original Hermes. But the one could not have been derived from the other, for each has one major element in his per- sonality not shared by the other. Janus was in the first instance a Sky god, but Hermes has not been credited with any sky associations. On the other hand, Hermes' original chief role was as fertil- ity and fecundity god, and this is lacking in the conception of Janus. This dual divergence would not coun- terbalance the multiple points of agree- ment even were it absolute; it would merely mean that Janus and Hermes were two branches from a common ori- gin, and had in these respects separated in growing away from the parent stem. And this last is to a certain extent true; but at the same time the differences are by no means absolute. For one of the commonest "effigies" of Hermes, very ancient in origin, was merely a heap of stones. These served to mark roads, and the grateful traveller was expected to add one to the mound. They were roughly conical, and it has been assumed that they were phallic, for a simple phallus also represented Hermes as a fecundity god. But from very early prehistoric times in the Orient (at least from the first half of the third millen- nium B.C.) a conical heap of stones was used to indicate the mountain which was the sky.10 On the other hand, it is surprising that Janus as a Sky god should not have had fertility functions, for the original Sky gods (third or fourth millennium B.C.) were primarily concerned with multipli- cation and increase. Thus we can posit a divinity as com- mon origin for Janus and Hermes who combined the major features of both. He will be multiple faced or headed; associ- ated with snakes ; with an entrance, quite probably (judging from Janus' place of worship) an archway; also with a body of water; he should serve as doorman, usher, messenger and carry a staff; he should be related to a small child or in- fant; and should be a god of the shining sky, associated with the idea of the sky as a mountain, which could be represented as a conical heap of stones. Additional features can be derived from Hermes' earliest personality. The fecundity Hermes was ithyphallic. He was closely associated with a goat: actu- ally represented as a goat, riding on a goat, or merged with the goat-man. He tended cattle, and was hunter as well as warrior. In early representations, he wears a conical cap. When his staff lias a fancy finial it sometimes seems to be in- tertwined branches, a residual tree form, suggesting that the predecessor (or pre- decessors, since the prior history would probably be long) had cosmological tree connections. 10.

For it is generally recognized that ancient gods went in couples. Early divinities were, at least often, bi-sexual, androgynous; then this all-inclusive individual was split into the sexual complements, much as Eve was separated out of Adam by a simple oper- ation. The counterparts then retained, for a time anyhow, the same essential charac- teristics and functions. Hermes has no recognized female equivalent, but Janus' is unmistakable. The feminine of his name Dianus is Diana, who as Moon goddess confirms the lunar implications of the crescent found in some of the Janus coin types, and the crescent coronet. For the rest, the familiar Latin Diana is of little use for the purposes of this analysis;11 but the lunar Diana (for Diana was a lady of many phases) had a Greek parallel so close that the two were often merged: the lunar Hekáte. The lunar Hekáte is, in turn, the female counterpart of the original Hermes, thus once more confirming the J anus- Hermes connection. Hekáte, like Janus and Hermes, is, in one type of representation, multiple faced or headed, usually three, rarely two. She also holds, not only the snake, but, like Janus, the key. She, too, watched over doors, and like Hermes, was repre- sented as a protector before many en- trances. She contributed to fertility (as such she holds flowers or fruit, or wears on her head some such ornament), and this is usually explained as a reference to the night dew.12 But it went further than this, for she presided over the birth and youth of wild animals, and also human marriage and birth. In some (admittedly 11. For this reason Smith- Marindin, loc. cit., denythe relation between Janus and Diana; but that is because the Hekáte - Hermes, Hermes - Janus relations have not been appreciated. 12. Thus P.

C. rare ) representations she retained a rem- nant of animalistic character: goat's ears.13 She, like Hermes, tended herds and also (here like Diana) shared his in- terest in hunting. Moreover she cooper- ated with Hermes in increasing the flocks and herds of goats, sheep and cows,14 an explicit recognition of their interrelation. The two are also quite often depicted to- gether on the early black-figured ware, but even were there not this overt associa- tion, it would be certain from the nine points of correspondence between the Janus-Hermes personality, on the one hand, and Hekáte, on the other (lunar., multiple visaged or headed, snake, key, door guardian, promotes fertility and fe- cundity, animal (goat) elements, patron of herds and flocks, huntress). Is there any trace of the multiple-faced god, goddess, or androgynous divinity who must have preceded, as common source, Janus, Hermes and Hekáte? Macrobius' assertion that Janus' snake emblem had come from Phoenicia finds objective support in bronze votive fig- urines from Sardinia, of a personage, in some renditions multiple headed, who is closely associated with serpents (Fig. la, b ) ,15 He is sometimes bearded, may be androgynous, and may wear a conical cap.

His em- blem is a bident, which immediately sug- gests a relation to the moon crescent, and in at least one case (Fig. 16) is not far from one form of Hermes' staff or wand. This personage might be in the direct descent of one or the other of the Classi- cal divinities, but seems closer to Hermes than to Janus. The Hermes worship was especially associated with Arcadia, and the cults of Fig. 4 GROUP FROM BLACK-FIGURED VASE. 7-6th CENTURY B. C. that region were of notable antiquity, and also notably faithful to their early forms, thanks to the district's freedom from wars and invasions. Herodotus believed that the ithyphallic version of Hermes had been adopted by the Athenians 400 years before his time,16 and there is no reason to doubt it. At about that same time (turn of the first to the second millennium B.C.) there appears in Luristan a personality of talismanic power, who shares the three most striking features of the Janus- Hermes complex : he is multiple visaged, 16. Historia, II. 51. with either two faces back-to-back (Fig. 2a, 6), or four (Fig. 2c), the two pairs of eyes serving, in shifting relations, for all four sets of features; he is connected with serpents, a symmetrical pair being merged into his body (Fig. 2c), or else he is throttling them (Fig. 26) ; and he is intimately associated with goats, standing on a pair of addorsed goats' heads (Fig. 26, c), and having himself, as legs, the hindquarters of a goat, dismembered and rearranged (Fig. 26, c), and sometimes goat's ears (Fig. 2a, 6). He is sometimes bearded (Fig. 2a), may be androgynous (Fig. 2a, 6), but even as such may have emphatic male genitals (Fig. 2a). In one case (Fig. 2c) he wears a high cap rather like a polos, and the polos was Hekate's most frequent head-gear. The accord is sufficiently complex and specific to establish a connection between Janus-Hermes and this Luristan person- ality, but there is no reason to posit a di- rect succession from the latter to either of the former. Rather, this would seem to be a third branch from a common stem. The Luristan art has been commonly connected with Mesopotamia, and some</page><page sequence="8">FOR IRANIAN ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 223 points of association are unmistakable. Is this one? Already in the preceding mil- lennium a multiple-faced god appears in the Sumerian pantheon, but he has only this one point of connection with the Luristan figure. He has, however, two other direct, and three indirect features that agree with elements in the Janus- Hermes complex. In the first place, he has been identified as Ara-Usmu, the messenger of E a. 17 What is more, we see him functioning as an usher , playing much the same role, on a cylinder seal (Fig. 3), 18 that Hermes does on a black-figured vase (Fig. 4), 19 though in this instance Hermes is not shown in his two-faced form. Ara-Usmu leads a woman (a goddess judging from her horned headdress, and a fertility god- dess judging from the plants sprouting from her conical cap) and a man, with no distinctive attributes, before Ea, who is seated enthroned, holding his attribute of the flowing vase. Hermes escorts the goddess Athena, followed by Herakles (the ancient Sun god who came from the same Arcadian pantheon as Hermes) be- fore Poseidon, holding his trident, who, like Ea, was "Lord of the Watery Deep".20 In the second place, the Sumerian divin- ity has a connection with Janus and Hermes (not important enough to stand alone but significant in the complex) in the short staff which he bears as mes- senger. The conical cap, frequent on Sumerian gods, recalls the conical cap that was Hermes' earliest headdress. The spears of grass or grain which grow on Ara-Usmu's cap strongly suggest that he, like Hermes, 17. E. D.

His connection with Ea who presided over the cosmic ocean (or atmosphere pool) re- calls that Hermes and Janus were both harbor patrons. Moreover, Ea had moon associations, among others direct connec- tion with a cosmological tree (kis~kanu) which looked like lapis-lazuli,21 the moon stone. There are too many points of associa- tion here to be dismissed, yet essential features like the serpent and the goat are lacking. The Sumerian pantheon, how- ever, represents clearly a derivative and evolved (or from another point of view degenerated) system. Original divinities of comprehensive function have been subdivided, often inconsistently; and that is what has evidently happened here, for another group of the attributes, in- cluding conspicuously the serpent and the goat, are attached to a second divine individual. This person, by the time we come to know him, has in turn been split into a variety of identities each indicated by an epithet, but it will suffice to call him Ningizzida.22 21. Ibid., p. 10. 22. H.

C. This Ningizzida23 is closely associated with serpents, including, among other forms, the caduceus. He is constantly accompanied by a goat or a ram. He per- formed the function common to Janus, Hermes, and Hekáte: he was the Warder of the Gate; but his "janitorship" was transcendental, for the gate at which he stood was that of the Palace of Anu,24 the supreme sky god who dwelt in the high- est heaven. Like Hermes he was warrior and hunter and furthered fertility and the multiplication of the flocks. Finally, on the seals there is often a crescent be- side him. The horned animal-man is still a third individual in this complicated mythol- ogy, but he, too, keeps the essential func- tion of usher or door guardian, and he continues as the last down to quite a late period in Mesopotamia. Here, then, are three divinities all re- taining the function of messenger, usher, door guardian, and each combining with this some of the other features of the Jason-Hermes complex so that the three together equal the total Jason-Hermes character, save for one important particu- 24.

Moreover, he also served as usher, replacing Ara-Usmu in an almost identical scene: Frothingham, op. cit., p. 183, Fig. 4 (after Ward, The seal cylinders of Western Asia, Wash- ington, 1910, No. 368 a). lar: no one of the Sumerian gods is, as far as we can tell, a Sky god. All this means that neither the Greek nor the Roman god was derived directly from Sumer, since the personality there is more dismembered and confused than in its later Classical appearance; nor is it sufficiently coherent in Sumer for that to be the source of the Luristan talis- manic demon (or god?). But Sumer does not exhaust the known possible predecessors. In Elam, also, early in the third millennium B.C., the two- headed male divinity appears (Fig. 5). 25 He is so closely associated with the ser- pent that the two are actually merged. The goat, also, is present; and on the other side is one of the cosmological trees. Here are the three major elements which occur together in the Luristan presenta- tion, but are dispersed in the Sumerian. The evidence of this Elamite seal can be supplemented from the Indus Valley (Fig. 6). 26 Here again is the three-faced god who is partly animalistic, with bo- vine horns. Between the horns he wears a polos-like cap, recalling the cap found in Luristan. Like the early Hermes, this trifrons is ithyphallic, and immediately connected with him (under his throne) are goats, while another horned animal, a bovine, stands beside him. This embod- iment of the idea is also connected with other animals, notably the great cats, as is the Luristan personality in many pres- entations. These interconnections between the archaic Elamite, the slightly later Indus Valley, and the much later Luristan in- dividuals suggests (indeed really indi- cates) a common center of diffusion, almost certainly on the Iranian plateau, where all the essential elements were 25.
