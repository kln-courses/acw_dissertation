<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG THE INDIANS OF NORTH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BY EDWIN M. LOEB T HE three Pomo creation myths contained in this paper are part of the material collected in the winter of 1924-25 while the writer was investigating the religion and mythology of the Pomo Indians. The trip was conducted under the auspices of the Department of Anthropology of the University of California through the generosity of the Guggenheim Brothers, of New York City. While these three myths were obtained from the same linguistic group, and deal in a general way with the same incidents and characters, yet they differ so essentially in spirit and philosophy that a summary of their cultural setting cannot well be avoided. In doing this, the author has drawn mainly from the published and manuscript works of Dr. A. L. Kroeber. The mythology of the California Indians is bound up in great part with their religious practices. Hence it will be well at the start to eliminate as far as possible two extraneous cultural regions. One of these divergent culture areas comprises the extreme north- western corner of the state, in the drainage of the lower Klamath and about Humboldt Bay. This region has been termed North- western California, and it constitutes a subdivision of the North Pacific Coast culture area. In this region the dances are not giver by a secret organization, nor does any organization of this nature possess mythology of an esoteric nature. The conception of a single supreme or original creator is totally wanting among the tribes of this area.' On the other hand, the story of the so-called "Culture Hero" or transformer is widely prevalent throughout the North- west. This hero is supposed to have given the world its present shape, to have killed monsters who infested the land, and to have given to men their arts and institutions. Among the Modoc, Kumush (Old Man) is the culture hero. Curtin believes that this hero has many of the attributes of Zeus, and that many of the 1A. L. Kroeber. Wishosk Myths. Journal American Folk Lore. Vol. xvi, p. 89. 467</page><page sequence="2">468 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 myths concerning this character are as sacred to Indians as Bible stories are to Christians,2 yet Kumush is far from an ideal char- acter in the very stories which Curtin has collected. Boas, with a far wider knowledge of a similar region, writes: In the Northwest, the being who gave the world its present shape, and man his arts, ivas not prompted by altruistic motives. He did so in the course of his personal adventures, often with the direct aim of harming his enemies ..... He combines in one person the benevolent being and the trickster.3 Another region to be eliminated from the discussion is that of Southern California. This area extends from the Tehachapi Pass and the mountains in the interior, and from Point Conception on the coast, southward to the Mexican boundary. While the tribes of this locality may be separated into two groups-those of the islands, coast and mountains, and those of the Colorado River, and into two religions, the Jimsonweed cult and the dream singing--yet the two religions have one factor in common, the lack of a true esoteric society. Religious experience in both cases is an individual matter. The Jimsonweed cult exists solely for the initiation, rather than the initiation for the cult, and membership is open to all of the tribe.4 The mythology of Southern California is not native to the state, but is evidently a borrowing from the Pueblo region, an area of high development of secret societies and priesthood organization. Under these circumstances it is not surprising to find creation stories here, with a well developed system of dualism.5 Better known is the universal story of develop- ment from Father Heaven and Mother Earth, and the coming of the culture hero, the "Dying God." Throughout, we encounter typically non-Californian migration stories.6 2 J. Curtin. Myths of the Modocs. Boston, 1912. p. 382. SIntroduction to James Teit. Thompson River Indian Traditions.

We may, for the sake of convenience, divide this region into two areas: that lying north of the latitude of San Francisco, and that lying south of the latitude of San Francisco. The first area is North Central California, and the second South Central Cali- fornia. North Central California has for its typical religion the Kuksu Cult.' This cult was probably in its original form merely an asso- ciation of shamans, with initiations for the purpose of instruction in the shamanistic arts, and god impersonations for the sole purpose of curing. Later, the society commenced giving four day cycles of esoteric dances with increasing complexity of god im- personations, and the original shamanistic ideas became almost extinguished in ceremonial display. In the meantime the original shamans developed into a hierarchy of priests, having a secret language, mythology, and system of crude astronomical knowl- edge. The head priest now had sole charge of the sacred dances. Curing was almost entirely delegated to non-initiated members of the tribe. In South Central California, with the exception of the Miwok, the Kuksu religion was absent. In its place there existed the Jimson weed cult, a probable importation from the island region of southern California. Here there was no true esoteric society, shamanism was individualistic, and no priesthood developed. It will be well now to turn to the mythology of the two regions in order to determine the influence that the different religions have played on the mythopoeic faculties of the tribes. Kroeber summarizes the resemblances of the two systems of mythology as follows: The possession of creation myths; the uniform antithesis, to a greater or less degree, of Coyote and the chief creator in these creation myths; the 'The Kuksu religion is named by anthropologists from its principal deity, Kuksu, "the first man," and a powerful shaman. In this paragraph I have summarized a portion of my unpublished material on Pomo religion. This substantiates, to a remarkable degree, the theories advanced on the Kuksu religion by Dr. Kroeber in his general book on anthropology.

In the south there are no developed or extensive creation myths. Also, there is scarcely a full creator. The eagle, who is most nearly such, is really only the chief among a number of equals. The mere fact that the creators are several, and that they are animals, must tend to minimize their distinctly creative qualities.8 I will add two more points of dissimilarity. In the south we find a lack of coherence in the creation stories, and a considerable admixture of obscenity. In the north these stories, when correctly told, are coherent and lack obscene incidents. Finally, the idea of actual creation, in the sense of a projection into objective existence of a world that preexisted in the mind of a creator, is found alone in the northern section.' In the south we find creation by a process of transformation, working on a pre-existing object, such as turn- ing sticks into men. The difference, then, between the mythology of the two regions lies chiefly in the character of the creation stories, and this difference is due not to a wide divergence in the material that goes to make up these stories, but rather to the philosophical and complex manner in which the creation stories of the north are compiled from common mythical material to be found in both sections. This compilation may be compared to the work of a modern master composer of music weaving together a symphony from the folk songs of his country. In the north, then, we have secret societies, a priesthood, and elaborate creation myths; in the south no secret societies, no priesthood, and only rudimentary creation myths. The connection between priesthood and elaboration of mythology is apparent, and, 8 A. L. Kroeber. Indian Myths of South Central California.

What is not so simple, and not so obvious, is the elaboration of the creation theme, giving to it a philosophical and even ethical tone, and cleansing from it all burlesque incident. When this has been done we have not the exoteric myth of a whole people, but the esoteric myth of a small group; and as this myth has been handed down from father to son, or uncle to maternal nephew, it has been brooded over and additions superimposed from generation to generation. The myth now becomes sacred, and as such is sharply distinguished from the profane myths of the common people. A cycle of these sacred myths accounts not only for the creation of the world and man, but may also give sanction to the ritual and social stratifica- tion of the tribe; they become, in fact, the backbone of the religion of the people. Taking now the individual tribes under consideration in which the Kuksu religion has been found, we find the greatest develop- ment of the cult to have centered in the southern Wintun, or Patwin. The cult has also been described among the surrounding Pomo, Miwok, Maidu, and Yuki peoples. So far as known, the correlation between the Kuksu cult and the elaboration of the mythology is perfect, excepting that the northern Wintun had a highly developed mythology, but have only in recent European times received the Kuksu religion, while the Miwok have the Kuksu religion, but no truly esoteric myth has been reported by field workers. Since esoteric myths are rather difficult to obtain 10 F. Boas. Mythology and Folktales of North American Indians. Jour. of American Folk Lore, 1914. p. 402. More recently, Paul Radin has attempted to show that the elaboration and puri- fication of myth is due, not to social causes, but to the efforts of individuals of pro- nounced "religious temperament." This is in part true, for the priesthood is mainly composed of the more devout tribal members. Yet, where there is no priesthood, as in South Central California, the religiously inclined individual appears to lack the opportunity of elaborating and handling down his special conception of the cosmos. See P. Radin. Monotheism among Primitive Peoples. London, 1924.</page><page sequence="6">472 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 from the California Indians, it does not follow that a true creation story among the Miwok is non-existent.o'" The conceptions regarding the character of the creator vary from group to group and even within the confines of a linguistic group." Thus, among the northern Wintun, Olelbis (Dwelling on High) is the creator, while Coyote brings death and trouble into the world, but among the southern Wintun, Coyote is the sole creator and benefactor of mankind. Among the Maidu, Earth Initiate, the creator, is again in opposition to Coyote. Among the Yuki, Taikomol (He who walks alone) is again in opposition to Coyote, although the latter also plays a supplementary part to the creator. .Although the actual Miwok creation story has not been obtained, it is apparent that among these people Coyote is the creator, Finally, among the coast central branch of the Pomo we find Coyote as the beneficent creator, while Marumda is the creator, and Coyote the evil spirit among the eastern division of this people.12 What has evidently happened is this: The common trans- former-trickster has been taken out of the folktales of the people and apotheosized.13 Coyote, in the sacred lore of the initiated, may be a beneficent creator, or he may be a scoffing Mephis- topheles; he never remains a Don Juan. The question as to whether or not the priesthood construct a system of dualism with an anthropomorphic deity in opposition to Coyote is purely a matter of chance and has nothing to do with the cultural status of the tribe.14 The northern Wintun were less advanced than the southern in the matter of the formation of a priesthood, and yet 10a Since this paper has gone to press, a creation story, with Coyote as creator, has been reported from the Coast Miwok. These people had the Kuksu religion. It has also been determined that the Sierra Miwok, among whom a true creation story was lacking, borrowed the Kuksu religion in recent times. 1x References to these creation stories are contained in Kroeber's Indian Myths of South Central California. University of California Publications. Vol. 4, No. 4. 12 See Creation Stories, Nos. 1 and 3. 13 The second story of this collection, an exoteric story of the coast central Pomo, is an account of Coyote in the role of trickster-transformer. 14 Boas believes that dualism indicates a high cultural development, while Radin's opinion is the exact qpposite. (Boas. Memoirs of American Folk Lore Society. 1898. p. 4; Radin. Religion of the North American Indians. Folk-lore, 1914, p. 362.)</page><page sequence="7">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 473 it is only among the northern that we find a system of dualism. The reverse conditions hold among the Pomo. The mere existence of a dualistic mythology argues nothing as to the development of religious thought. It is, in fact, found in South Central Cali- fornia as well as in North Central California. It may finally be stated that a high degree of regional variabil- ity is to be expected in the case of the esoteric stories, since they are the personal possessions of small groups of individuals. While the discussion has so far hinged on Central California, it is not to be thought that this correlation between the growth of the priesthood and the elaboration and systematization of mythol- ogy is one that is to be limited either in time or space. Boas has already pointed out this correlation among the Mexicans, the Pueblo tribes, and the Pawnee.'5 Turning our attention eastward we find among the Central Algonkin peoples of the Eastern Wood- land area a secret shamanistic society known as the Midewiwin, and an elaborate and methodical mythology. The same stories which are common among the non-initiated concerning Ma~na~bush, the "foolish fellow," have been taken over, altered, given a religious character, and utilized by the secret society of the Menomini to exalt Manabush, and, incidentally, the secret society.'" In Polynesia the same correlation holds true. The priesthoods of this region are of a composite nature. A portion of them have been termed "inspirational-priests" (taula-atua) and give evidence of having originated from shamans. Another portion gives evidence of having developed from skilled artisans, who have mastered the charms of their professions. These are the kahuna. In Niue, however, there are no kahuna, and the taula-atua are mere shamans." In this island, alone, we find the lack of a The arguments that Dixon has brought forward on the subject are not to the point, since he argues from the standpoint of "the general stage of culture of the people," while everyone else is concerned merely with religious developments evinced by the presence of a secret society and priesthood.

There is no reason why this same correlation should not hold true among civilized peoples whose mythopoeic stage occurred in great part before the utilization of writing. We do, in fact, find a great conflict of myth, together with the intrusion of decidedly irreligious incident in the accounts of the Greek divinities. Among these people a true priesthood was late in development, and throughout Greek history remained local in character. It is no doubt for this reason that Zeus has been described as "an eternal father, who swallowed his wife, lay with his mother and sister, made love as a swan, and died, nay, was buried, in Crete." In contrast to the Greeks are the Hebrews, whose accounts of their Creator have been more or less carefully pruned by a conscientious national priesthood.'8 Reverting now to the three creation stories here presented, it will be seen that they are widely divergent in type, although all obtained from Pomo informants. Stories number I and II were obtained from Boston, a native of the Coast Central Pomo, and a man who was initiated by his maternal grandfather into the secret society called Yomta, on the coast. Story I was taught to the informant by the grandfather in great secrecy, and it contains many of the esoteric doctoring songs of the cult. Story II was told by the same informant. This story is, however, exoteric, and I had previously heard the myth, although not in so complete a form. It should be mentioned here that the Coast people are marginal in their possession of the cult; that is, the initiated are still more in the nature of shamans than priests. It is, perhaps, for this reason that their creation story is not so advanced in thought as the East Pomo story III in which a creation of the world from a preconceived idea in the mind of the creator is a prominent feature. Story III was obtained from William Benson, p. 393 ff. See also: The Social and Political Systems of Central Polynesia. R. W. Williamson (Cambridge, 1924). Vol. II, p. 405 ff. 18 Andrew Lang.

This myth is presumably complete in the relation of incident, but not com- plete as a matter of detailed narration. Although I worked among the North Pomo, I was unable to find any informant capable of giving the esoteric mythology. However, from the information of Bowen, a prominent shaman of these people, I gathered that the North Pomo believed in Coyote as the sole creator who fashioned men from feathers. Bowen also recounted how the hands of man were made in imitation of the lizard, and not the coyote. This incident is common to all of California mythology, but was not related to me from the other Pomo regions. Marumda, the creator, is not known to the people of the north or central regions, and this belief, therefore, must be native solely to the Eastern Pomo.'9 The Coast Pomo had only four sacred directions, to which prayer was addressed before doctoring. These were south, west, north, and east. The addition of sky and earth occurs among the East Pomo. CREATION STORIES I In the beginning there was no ocean. It was Coyote who created the ocean. Coyote thirsted for water, and so he went out a-searching, and came upon a bunch of swamp tussock plants. Coyote pulled one of these plants up, and immediately the water started to flow. Coyote started to drink, but the flow raised him high into the air. Then Coyote started to paddle toward the shore, for the ocean had already started into being. Coyote faced the water, which was still rising, and said: Ka elebida hampke. Water right here stop. The water stopped at the place on which Coyote was standing. The water was calm and still at that time. Coyote said, "It will be low tide sometimes, and the people will be able to get food I feel quite certain that any conception of a creator, beyond Marumda and Coyote, was originally lacking among the Pomo. The Chakalle, or "Man Above" mentioned by Powers for the North Pomo, simply means "captain." (Tribes of Calif., Contrib. N.A. Ethn. III, p. 161).</page><page sequence="10">476 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 here." Coyote commenced gathering weeds, but the water was too high, and so Coyote commanded that it go down in order that the people might gather more food. Coyote was aloi)e at this time. When he came out from the ocean he started to built a sweat-house. When he came to the place of the sweat-house he found the center pole, and the other poles already there lying on the ground. Coyote wished for the sticks to stand up by themselves. As he wished it, the sticks sprang into position. When the sweat-house was finished, Coyote obtained black feathers and stuck these up around the sweat-house. That is the reason why Indians are black. Then Coyote faced the fire, and spoke to the feathers: "You all become people." After this Coyote stood up and told the people that there would be a dance. Coyote taught the people the dance songs, first instructing them in the whistle song: Yo ho ya ha ya ha, Ha ka pill ye, Hi hi ye. Coyote next called for a feast. The people never gave Coyote anything out of the feast. For a whole month they never gave him anything to eat. At the end of the month Coyote became angry. It was for this reason that Coyote started the world fire. Coyote went around the world eight days putting pitch under the world. The people did not know what Coyote was doing, for he traveled in secrecy. After this the fire started. As the fire was burning the people cried out, "Father, don't let me burn!" But Coyote replied, "I, too, shall get burned." A fog came along, however, and Coyote arose in it, until he was high up in the air like a bird. From there he called to the fire to con- tinue its burning: Yo mata ka co. This was spoken in Coyote language, and means: Yo ho mdico. South fire burning. After this Coyote wanted to put out the fire on the hill tops where it was still burning, so he made a flood. From the heavens</page><page sequence="11">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 477 where he was still staying he wished for rain. He allowed it to rain for five days, and he then allowed the flood to remain for four more days. Then he made the waters recede. After the waters had receded, Coyote made another race of people. He used black feathers again, but this time in an open field. The same day that he set the feathers out, they became people. This was all done by a wish. Coyote instructed the people to go down to the beach and gather mussels. He went with them; but the people made fun of Coyote, and this made him angry. He then wished for waves, and this is the way that waves started in the ocean. Coyote, however, had never asked that the waves should overflow their banks. But the waves were overflowing their banks and dashing into the woods. Coyote said that he had never asked for this and so he stopped it at once. Next Coyote posted four men to make the wind blow. He posted the men in the North, the South, the West, and the East. He said to West-wind man: "You are not to blow too hard." He said the same thing to South-wind man, but to North-wind man he said: "You are to blow a little harder than South-wind man." Coyote told the four wind men, "When you blow you will make it rain. When it rains it will rain more in the winter months, but do not have floods." At this time it was still night; there was as yet no daylight. Coyote told Bakeela (Thunder-man) to make his sound when it started to rain, and when it cleared off. He told Bakeela to go half way up to the sky, and over the heavens. He told him also not to break the rocks or trees too much. All these things Coyote commanded in front of the people, yet they did not believe in him. Then Coyote grew wroth, and he spoke: "You will be cottontails, you, gophers, and you, birds." He apportioned the various foods among the birds, telling some to live on meat and others on fish. He told the birds that they should live in the air, and the cottontails should live in the grass. Coyote next said that he would create night and day, and that he would place the sun in the sky. He turned to the bird people, some of whom were faster than the others. He told them to try</page><page sequence="12">478 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 to see who could put the sun into the sky. The buzzard lived only on the waters, and he was the fleetest of them all. It was he who put the sun into the sky. The sun was taken from the ground where the people were standing. The people watched the buzzard coming down, and they had a big basket full of beads to pay him with. So the people paid the buzzard. Coyote told the sun to appear in the morning and to hide at night. When Coyote made the sun, he had a mud basket. The water was clear as crystal in the basket. He told this water: "You will be daylight and night." After this Coyote wished for the stars to shine at night. "The stars will be more numerous than the sands of the earth," he said. Suddenly one of the stars fell, but Coyote saw it when it was half way down. "Tu, tu, tu, tu," he cried; "that is not the way I am telling you to act." Next Coyote made the moon. He placed this himself. He did this by wishing. "So many days you will divide yourself; you will not always be full," he told the moon, giving him clothing to cover himself with, so that he should not always be full. Then he told the moon about growing the food, especially the buckeye and the acorn. The moon was to grow all of the food. Coyote made the fog out of his own breath; he blew it out. This he created for the purpose of sprinkling grass and grain, so that things would grow. Coyote told the people that if the sun stayed in one place it would burn things up. He told the moon to go behind and in front of the sun in order to make things grow. Coyote turned toward the people. "You people do not believe in me now, but watch what I do." Next Coyote faced the south, and swayed back and forth toward the east and west in order to see whether the earth would sink. As he did this the west side of the earth sank. (There was water under the earth, and that was why Coyote was able to shake it.) Coyote next went to the East pole, and pounded to see whether the earth shook. Then he went to the south pole and clear round in order to see which side of the earth was shaking.</page><page sequence="13">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 479 When Coyote came to the South pole, he made one man to watch this pole. He named this man Kuksu.20 He also made Kuksu a wife, Kuksu-woman. Kuksu and his wife were ordered to wear always the "big head." He told the couple that when people doctored they would mention their names. He told Kuksu to cure some of the people, but not to cure every time. He told the woman that she would also be called Kuksu, and that she should do likewise. Then he taught the woman the Kuksu doctoring song for blindness: Matane a huyue Habe e a yo Masi lemi Kuksu a mata Ho ho ya.21 20o Kuksu is an important character in Pomo mythology and in certain cere- monials. He is a person of characteristic Pomo physique, but possesses great power as a medicine man or doctor. He always appears painted entirely black, wearing on his head a very large headdress, called "big head," and with a tuft of shredded tule fiber attached to the small of his back. He carries a black cane or wand, and, while doctoring, blows constantly a large whistle made of elderberry wood. (S. A. Barrett. Jour. Amer. Folk Lore. 19, p. 40 N. 1.) 21 The two songs here given are very sacred, and were sung in the secret language of the Yomta, or secret society of the Coast Central Pomo. Among these people the association of Yomta did practically all of the curing, sucking doctors were unknown, and there were no outfit doctors outside of the society. While I was unable to obtain a literal translation for these two songs, I was instructed as to their general meaning. In the first song Coyote names the eyes (huyue) of Kuksu woman (Kuksu a mata) and instructs the Kuksu woman to make the eyes of the sick woman (matane) as perfect as her own. Coyote also instructs Kuksu woman to remain on the end (lemi) of the earth. This song was an esoteric cure for blindness, and was perhaps sung by a woman Kuksu impersonator. The second song was sung in order to cure a scared person. If a person believes that he has seen Kuksu, Bagil (a mythical dragon), or Guya (a ghost), the head Yomta rigs up in the Kuksu outfit and runs in to the patient, who is placed lying in the open. The Kuksu makes four charges toward the patient, and then takes off his outfit and places it upon the patient's body. Then he blows his whistle four times from the head of the patient down to his feet. After he is through blowing the whistle, he takes the rigging off the sick man's body, and places it on the sick man's feet. He does this four times. Then Kuksu picks up his headgear, and smacks his lips four times at it, after which he throws the headgear on the ground. Then Kuksu blows his whistle four times at the patient's head, twice on each side, after which he shakes the patient's head four times, smacking his lips. He does this, likewise, to three other parts of the sick man's body, the arms, waist, and legs.</page><page sequence="14">480 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 After this Coyote taught the Kuksu man the song with which to cure scared people: Yo la lal a ha Habe yoho Kuksu Halaji Mi kejina. After Coyote had finished teaching Kuksu man and Kuksu woman all of their songs, he tested the pole which held up the south end of the earth by getting hold of it and shaking it, after which he went away. When he found the South pole solid, he called the south yoma. Next Coyote went east, then north, west, and south. He did not stop but went clear around the world. Finally, he went back to west, and then to north. Coyote placed a man at the North pole. This was Wind man (yadjaj).22 Coyote said to Wind-man, "You will make the winds blow, and sometimes in doctoring, the people will mention your name. Coyote gave Wind-man four sticks tied like a (modern) windmill; this was called yap tipta. At the end of each stick there was placed a basket. Coyote showed Wind-man how to turn the windmill over and thereby make the wind blow. Then Coyote told Wind-man to try his instrument. Wind-man turned the mill, but he did it so rapidly that the wind made a clean sweep of the earth, tearing off all of the dirt. "Sh-sh-sh," cried Coyote, "not that way." The earth was perfectly flat before, but when the first wind came it blew up the dirt, and made knolls. That is why there are hills today. Coyote made the ocean run south with the wind. Next Coyote went east, and called for the man there. When the man appeared After tihis comes the singing of some song, such as the above, and a prayer addressed to the four directions, South, West, North, and East. Finally, the relatives bring four baskets of acorn mush, and four baskets of pinole as payment. In the song given, mention is made of the Kuksu headdress, kejitna. In the continuation of the song, here omitted, mention is made of the Kuksu necklace, whistle, belt, stick, and black paint. All of these articles were given by Coyote to Kuksu at the time of creation, and from then on possessed magical qualities in effecting ctres. 22Wind Man is not impersonated in any of the dances or cures of the Pomo, nor are the gods of the east or west.</page><page sequence="15">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 481 Coyote named him Fire-man (hodjaj). Coyote told Fire-man that he would have charge of daylight and heat.23 Coyote also instructed Fire-man not to throw too much heat out during the winter months, and thus prevent things from growing. The sun was about half way up when Coyote was talking to Fire-man. But Coyote made the sun move back again. "You went too fast," said Coyote to the sun, "You go slowly now and please the people out in the world."24 All of the stars, the moon, and the fogs start from the east, because that is where the sun comes from. Coyote named three people in the east: Ka'a djaj, Daylight- man, Ka'a mata, Daylight-woman, and Ho djaj, Fire-man. Coyote then started the daylight song, in order to instruct Daylight-woman. He told the woman that she should only mention two names in the song, Bakuku (owl) and Cokalala (a large species of swallow). Kale ya le a, Kale ya le lo, Mana bakulu djaj, You Owl-man, Ka'a elbaloke, Daylight will call. Owl-man, you will stand facing east, and from there call for daylight.26 Coyote taught this song to Daylight-woman, and Daylight- man listened. Coyote told the Fire and Daylight people that when people on earth doctored they would be mentioned in the doctoring songs. Before he left he also instructed these people not make it dark too long, but to make daylight and night of equal length. "You do all this all the time, and don't forget," he said. 23 It will be noticed that in this myth the sun does not create daylight, but another personage is needed for the purpose. '4 The slowing up of the sun, ascribed in Polynesia to Maui, is a feat known elsewhere in California. Among the Yana it is Jupka who slows up the course of the sun. 2 The second verse is the same, only the name of the swallow is substituted for that of the owl.</page><page sequence="16">482 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 After this Coyote went back to the North pole, and then to the West pole. When he got to the West pole he called out: "Lul lul lul lul lul." Then Water-man (ka djaj) came. He was a person, but you could see that he was made entirely of water. "You, Water-man," said Coyote, "You watch the West pole, lest it break." Then Coyote instructed Water-man, "The sun," he said, "will come on your trail, and when he gets here you will tell him to go back. This will be your work." Just at this moment the sun came and climbed down the West pole, and stopped right there. There was water at the bottom of the pole. The sun stayed in the water and cooled off, so that he would not make the bottom of the earth hot. There was a basket of water that the sun was to sit in when he came from the east, and eight bouquets of different kinds of flowers around the basket. The flowers were red, white, blue, black, light brown, green, and purple. These flowers were placed there before the sun rose back. If the flowers remained fresh and did not wilt, the sun was let go, but if they wilted the sun was forced to remain a little longer. This was done so that the earth would not catch fire. While Coyote was still at the West pole with Water-man he called for Thunder-man. "Cadjata ya we e e e e e! Bakeela ya we e e e e e! Hikok ya we e e e e el Kaliba tautau ya we e e e e eV" These were the four names of Thunder-man. Then Thunder-man appeared. When he came in, a big hail storm came with him. The hail was as large as marbles. As Thunder-man entered he took something from under his left arm; it was lightning. It very nearly burned the pole.</page><page sequence="17">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 483 "Tu tu tu tu," said Coyote; "not that way." From under the same arm Thunder-man took out a deer skin. This made a thundering sound and shook the earth. Coyote again stopped him in the same way, for fear he would crack the earth. Then Coyote instructed Thunder-man, "You will not stay here. You will stay half-way east, half-way north, half-way south, and half-way west. You will stay in the center. Your house will be built of rock. The only door that you will have will be on top. The water will not get in from the top. From that place you will go east and show your light, by raising your arm. You must not keep your arm up too long, or you will set the earth on fire." From Thunder-man's house Coyote made a fish hole on the east side. He gave Thunder-man three things, the whistle (libu), the cocoon rattle (kaiyau), and the split rattle stick (haibat- aubatau). He told Thunder-man not to make the sound of thunder from his house, but to go far up in the sky and to travel east, north, south, and west. He should make the sound of the thunder by dragging his deerskin, but he should not make the sound too long, for fear of cracking the earth. Coyote said, "When you go up in the sky let no one see you. You will only make the sound when there is rain, hail, and clouds. You will hide behind the clouds. You will only make it thunder four times, or if you wish more noise, do it eight times, but no more. When you do this do not jump too hard upon the earth, for the wind you make by your jumping will break some of the trees. It will not break all of the trees, but it will break some of the trees." Then Coyote told Thunder-man that he would have long hair. The hair would flow all the way down to his feet. "When water comes into your house," said Coyote, "your long hair will float you out." "When rain makes the rivers rise up," added Coyote, "you will let the salmon out from the fish house into the rivers." The final instructions of Coyote were concerning doctoring. "When anybody is sick, doctoring will be done in your name, and from the trees you strike medicine sticks will be taken."'" Then Coyote went away. 26 These sticks are called kalicbau. There are four of them, each six inches long. I was unable to obtain any information concerning the use of these sticks in</page><page sequence="18">484 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 The sun was already on top of the water when Coyote stopped talking. He first went east, where Fire-man, Daylight-man, and Daylight-woman were, and he told these three people that he was going to make another race, but of a different kind. The first village he made he named Kamalaldapo, and then Tomkai, Ciulkea, Basultakea, and Yokaia. Then turning south he made Cokawa, Makahmo, and Nisaalke. After Coyote had named each village he stuck up four black feathers in each of the places where the people were to be. Then he wished. At once the people commenced to appear. As soon as all of the people were present he instructed each village to build a sweat-house. He told them to dance and feast. They should do this sometimes, but not every day. He told them not to poison or kill one another, and, if they obeyed, the wild oats would grow in abundance for them. But when he told them these things he also said that there would be fire again, and flood again, if the people did not do right. Coyote also told the people not to go over their village grounds and steal. If they wished to go over they should ask, permission. If they killed or poisoned one another, there would be another flood and another fire. Coyote then named all of the plants that the people should eat: the acorns, the nuts, and the fish. He told them when they had plenty, when the acorns were abundant, they should have feasts and dances, but that they should not do this all of the time. By doing this way, by having feasts and dances when the acorns grew, they would have plenty for the next year. From that place the people never saw where Coyote went. After he had departed they commenced dancing. No one has ever seen him since. II Coyote was the father of Thunder-man. Coyote had no wife, but Thunder-man was his son just the same. Coyote was living with Thunder-man. Coyote was quite old at this time. medicine, the bull-roarer (padok) alone being used. Among the North Pomo the bull- roareris also used in medicine; there it is called Kalimitautaupadok (the doll of Thunder- man) and is made from lightning-struck trees. Among all Pomo the bull-roarer is esoteric, its nature being concealed from women and uninitiated men.</page><page sequence="19">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 485 One day Thunder -man started out to fish from the South pole. He traveled north, and whenever he came to a river he started to wade down and lay baskets there. But each time he saw that there were no fish in the river, and he continued on. Thunder-man did this every day. Each day he was unsuccess- ful. Finally he came to Buldam (Big River). There he camped on the north side of the river. He had his wife and his father Coyote along with him. Thunder man built a dam in the river, and laid his fish basket alongside of the dam. This grew into an oak tree which is still there down to this very day. Then Thunder- man was finished and he went home. Thunder-man told his father Coyote to go down and look at the dam and see whether it was washed away. Coyote went down to inspect the dam. He stood alongside of it and saw that the sticks of the dam were tied with snakes. This sight made Coyote faint, and he fell down into the sand. When his father did not come home, Thunder-man himself went down to look at the dam. He saw the old man lying in the sand, and so he continued on to find out if there were any fish in the basket. It was a whale. Thunder-man dragged the whale to the shore, and cut off its tail. In the meanwhile Coyote had gone home. The wife of Thunder- man had gone out to get wood. When she had filled her basket full of wood, she put the strap of her basket over her shoulder, and tried to lift it up. She was unable and so she threw off some of the wood and tried again. She failed once more to lift the basket. Then she looked under the basket. There was Old Man Coyote clinging to the bottom of the basket! Coyote jumped up and seized the woman. Thunder-man came home from fishing. He found his wife crying, but she did not tell her husband what had happened. Thunder-man then made a hole in the ashes in order to cook the fish tail. He threw the fish tail into the hole, after which he picked up his father and threw him also into the hole with the fish tail. Then he trampled down the place, and covered it with hot ashes. Old Man Coyote cried out, "I feel warm." He managed finally to make a hole in the side of the oven and creep out, but his fur was all singed.</page><page sequence="20">486 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 Meanwhile, the wife of Thunder-man was pregnant and she kept on crying all the time. As soon as Thunder-man was finished attending to his father, he once more questioned his wife as to why she was crying. "Have you a headache, or is your baby about to come?" The woman did not answer, but kept on with her crying. Thunder-man whipped his wife and kicked her out of the door. The woman hung on to every object she could find-trees, bushes, and rocks. But the husband tore off her grasp each time, and continued kicking her along. He kept kicking her toward the ocean. Finally they came to the bluff at Buldam. Here the woman turned to her husband and pleaded, "Leave me alone now, stop now, my husband." But Thunder-man was angry, and he would not stop. There was a round hole over the bluff, and the man kicked his wife into this hole. The woman crept down from this hole, and swam out to the rocks. There she gave birth to her child. The child was a seal. This was the way that the seals started." When the husband saw that his wife had given birth to a child, he stood on the bank and called to the woman to come back, holding out baskets and beads in his hands. But the woman paid no attention as she was facing south. And so Thunder-man went to the side of the bluff and commenced throwing sticks into the water, cursing his wife, "You will turn into a seal, you will turn into a shark." For each stick he named a different fish. Then Thunder-man went home and took out the whale tail which he had buried under the ashes. He opened out the tail and started to eat it. Coyote was lying there, all singed, but he was given none of the fish. When Thunder-man had eaten his fill, he took out all of his best robes and baskets and laid them on the ground. Then he commenced singing love songs. 27 The rocks here referred to are rocks about a mile and a half from the coast at Big River. These, in former times, were crowded with seals at certain times of the year. The Pomo seal hunters were accustomed to swim out to these rocks, not possess- ing seaworthy rafts, and club the seals. They would then swim back with the booty. Only the btrongest swimmers could engage in this profession.</page><page sequence="21">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 487 The first animals that entered the house were two skunk girls. Then all other kinds of female birds and animals came in, for it was still in the bird age. Presently the house was full of animals. Finally two mallard duck sisters arrived. When these came in Thunder-man stopped his singing. Phew!" cried all of the animals, "there is something in here that stinks!" It was the skunk women, and so they were driven out of doors. Thunder-man told everyone to help himself to the whale tail. But they were all bashful. Finally Crow girl took a bite from it. She was very good looking, being all shiny and black. After Crow had tasted she said to the others, "This tastes fine; now you all come and eat." The women then ate half of the tail. Thunder-man tied both of the mallard ducks with hairs from his head; he wished them for his wives, and feared lest they escape. To his father, Coyote, he gave Toad-woman. She, indeed, was far from being a beauty! Thunder-man put beads around the necks, waists, wrists, and on the hair of the two mallard ducks. He married them in this way.28 And they, in truth, were the prettiest of all the animals. After this the remainder of the company departed. Only Frog- woman and mallard ducks remained. Thunder-man went to get wood. He had a big sling and four large rocks ready for use. He picked one out and departed. There was a dry tree standing near at hand. Thunder-man hit it with the rock and broke it into pieces. He took some of the wood home. Thunder-man was able to carry a huge load, enough to last for three or four days. Thunder-man stayed with his wives for four days. On the fifth day he went away alone. He took with him all of his good cos- tumes, bead hair nets, robes, bear skins, otter skins, panther skins, and brown bear skins. He wore all of these on his body, and departed, going west. 28 The Pomo never married after this fashion, i.e., by singing love songs and giving beads to the bride. They used this method to obtain mistresses. Marriage was an affair arranged between the two families.</page><page sequence="22">488 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 Thunder-man walked on the top of the water. You could see the water splash as he walked. He had four little sticks on his head, which were hair pins he used to fasten down his hair net."9 After he had progressed a fixed distance from the shore, he pulled out one of these hair pins and stuck it into the water. You could see the pin sticking right into the surface of the water. The same distance a little further along he stuck down another pin. He kept on doing this until he came to the further edge of the water, where he stuck in his fourth and last pin. Then Thunder-man went under the water. The last pin started to cry out, "Hu hu hu hu!" Old Man Coyote heard this pin cry out from the distance. He then began to imitate his son. He dressed in his finest clothing and went outside where he answered the four calls. Then he started off. With the first step that Coyote made from the shore, he stepped on one of the pins that his son had set up. He made four steps, each time stepping on a pin, and with the last step he landed on the further shore. When Coyote landed he looked around. Thunder-man was not in sight. So Coyote tried to build a boat out of tule; he tried for two days, and finally succeeded. He had pulled out the pins while walking across the water, and these pins he now stuck into the boat. When the boat was finished, Coyote turned the prow east, but as yet did not get into the craft. Suddenly four great peals of thunder came from under the water. Then Thunder-man appeared, amidst a storm of rain and hail. The hail storm was so heavy that it cut the boat into rib- bons. While it rained and thundered, Old Man Coyote talked to himself; "Why did you do that-thunder, lightning, and rain- without my knowledge?" Coyote then made another speech. "All right,"' he said, "you make it rain, but that is all you will do. You are no longer my son." 29 The hair pins of the Pomo Indians were called kan6, and were made of man- zanita wood.</page><page sequence="23">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 489 When Thunder-man heard this, he raised Coyote right up into the air with a flash of lightning. Coyote yelled, "Miede, mede, mede." (Son, son, son.) The old man continued, however, in his flight to the heavens. Finally he stopped on one of the clouds and rested. From the cloud he called out to the two wives of Thunder-man, "You will turn into birds and swim in the water." To his own frog wife he called, "You will remain under the water." Then he wished that they would have a hard time of it, and that the water would be rough all of the time. After this Coyote continued on his journey to the heavens. As he rose he stopped four times, and each time the heavens shook. Then the sky opened and he went right up into it. From that time on nothing further has been heard of Coyote. III Marumda was a man-like being who lived in a cloud house in the north. He had no one to talk to except himself. He called Kuksu a brother. He said that Kuksu knew his own ideas as well as he did himself. Marumda talked and talked and talked to himself. Then he started. He took one of his hairs from his head, and asked the air to direct him in the direction of his brother. A breeze came along and pointed south, and he followed this direction. Marumda came to the house of Kuksu. It was the same as his own, a cloud house. Marumda suggested to Kuksu that they make the world and Kuksu agreed. Kuksu then took a little piece of gum from under each of his arms and rolled it into a ball. He also rolled a little piece of feather with the gum. He handed it to Marumda. Marumda took some fur from under his arms and rolled it into a ball, and then he rolled the two balls together. Marumda had a pipe with designs on it. Everything on the pipe corresponded to things as they would appear on the earth. Marumda pointed out where everything should be. In one place the forests, in another the brush, in still another place the water. All this as marked on the pipe. Marumda filled his pipe with tobacco and blew the smoke on</page><page sequence="24">490 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 the ball. Then he wished, as he smoked, that this thing should be here, and that that thing should be there, all in accordance with the design. Marumda then attached a sinew cord to the ball and tied the other end of the sinew ball to his ear. He lay there holding the ball in his hand. Every once in a while as he went to sleep the ball jerked. Each time, however, there was as yet nothing there. This jerking and sleeping continued for eight days. Every day he turned over he called it a day."3 On the eighth day Marumda went to sleep. Suddenly the ball got so heavy and large that it slipped from his hand and pulled him along with it. It was the earth. Marumda went around the earth to see if the water and mountains were placed correctly, according to the designs he had upon his pipe. But as yet there were no people nor animals upon the earth. So Marumda said to Kuksu, "We must make some- thing that will occupy the mountains and forests." And so he made deer, and birds, and rabbits. He made these before people. Then Marumda and Kuksu went around the world together, but they saw no people, and so Marumda said, "We must have someone here to take care of all of this. There must be some people to enjoy the world." Kuksu gave Marumda four feathers with which to make people. Marumda took these feathers and made women. Then he took his own hair and made men. He put the people here and there, wherever it was a good place for a village. He showed them where there was basket material, trees, and all things which they would require. Marumda also showed the people how to handle the materials. The people baked the first acorns and Kuksu showed them how to soak the acorns. Marumda told the people that if they killed any of the animals at the times when their women folk were menstruating, great harm would fall upon them. He also told the animals where they should go and live. Then he told the people how they should kill and eat the animals. so As yet there was no sun, night, nor daylight.</page><page sequence="25">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 491 Marumda went to the ocean. "What is this water for?" he asked. He fetched one of the men whom he had made, but the man was unable to drink of the water. Marumda then said, "This water is not for you to drink, but to bring you food. Your water is clear and is on mountains." Marumda next made the shell fish, and other fishes of all kinds. After this the people went down to the ocean to gather these foods. After this Marumda desired that there should be light, so that the people might see. So Marumda lit his pipe, and while he smoked he prayed. Then he blew the fire out toward the heavens. A big ball of fire blew out, casting sparks in all directions. These sparks remained; they did not go out. The sparks turned into stars, and the ball of fire became the sun. Marumda said, "This sun will watch over you and cook your food. When this goes out, you will take your rest; but when it shines then you must hunt." But this first race of people presently became cruel, for they had too much power; they could fly and they could crawl. They began to commit incest with one another. Marumda said that the great waters would come over them, and destroy all of the people. It happened after that fashion. Only a few families survived the flood. The beaver family and the otter family were not destroyed. These families were named that way, because they could turn into these animals when they desired. They could not turn into any other kind of animals. They survived because they could live amidst the waters. From that time on the beavers could marry into the otter family, or the otter could marry into the falcon family, but one family could not intermarry with each other.3' That is the way in which the second people started. At the time of the flood Frog put fire away in his stomach, and 31 Field workers among the East Pomo have never been able to find traces of moieties, clans, or totemism among the people, nor are the natives given to the usage of inherited animal names. Marriage is prohibited within the family to the fifth cousin. Presumably this totemic tradition was borrowed. The Sierra Miwok have moieties and a system of totemism.</page><page sequence="26">492 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 28, 1926 kept the coal burning in this fashion. He did this down in the beaver cave. Beaver knew about this, and so he and Falcon prepared dry tinder on the raft on which they were sitting. Then they went down to get Frog. When they came up with Frog they brought him to the raft and made him spit up the coal onto the dry bush. This is the way that fire started. Presently the waters commenced to go down. Then they sent Falcon flying high up into the air in search of land. Falcon saw a black speck far off in the distance. He came down and told the others that he was going over to the place. When he came back he brought some black dirt with him; it was from the land that he had sighted. The people waited until more of the land appeared, and then Otter and Beaver moved the raft over to the dry spot, with Frog sitting on top of the logs. After this the people stayed on the dry land and kept moving down as the waters receded. Falcon family got hungry and thirsty, for they could not drink of the flood waters. They sent Beaver family down to their den to bring up some cooked food. But Beaver family could not bring up water, and so Frog went down and brought up some water. The waters receded further, and the mountains and valleys commenced to appear. Presently the people were able to find the places where they belonged. It was during these times32 that Coyote appeared. The weather was still mild, the sea was still smooth, and people were getting their food too easily. So Coyote went in and splashed up the ocean. "This is the way you were meant to act," said Coyote to the ocean. And so the water spirit began to make waves, and the wind began to blow. Marumda came to inspect the villages. He told the people to be better than the first race. "If you act the way that you did, you will also be destroyed," he said. The people still possessed the power of becoming either animals or human beings. Falcon, for example, could be either # The period of the second people is commonly referred to as the "Bird Age" in Pomo mythology.</page><page sequence="27">LOEB] CREATOR CONCEPT AMONG INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA 493 falcon or man. If a man rolled in the dust, he would turn into a falcon. After a long time the people again violated the marriage, hunting, and fishing laws. Marumda therefore sent a wild fire over the face of'the earth. When the fire came some of the people ran into the water to remain there until the fire was out. But the water commenced to boil, and it killed the people in that way. Some of the people climbed up high trees, but the trees also caught fire. As the fire commenced to destroy them, the people called upon Marumda to save them. But Marumda replied, "How can I save you when I also shall get burned?" However, Spider came along, and took Marumda up in his net. It was in this way that he was saved. Falcon once more was saved. He flew high up in the air, but all of his beautiful feathers were turned black by the smoke. They are still black down to this very day. Frog was also saved. He went away down under the ground and carried the water with him. After Marumda had destroyed as much as he desired, he took away from the people the power of changing their forms. From that time on the people were real people, and could no longer become animals; the animals were real animals, and could no longer become people.
