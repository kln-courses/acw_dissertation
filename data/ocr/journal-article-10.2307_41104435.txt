ISBN 0-946897-85-9 (paper) US $32.50 (paper). 1995 The Upper Palaeolithic mammoth hunters of the Russian plain left behind not only traces of their settlements, their tools, and their food remains, but also abundant testimony to their symbolic or (for want of a better word) cul- tural life, ranging from enigmatic markings and decoration on bone and stone objects to zoomorphic and anthropomorphic statuettes. Art of the Mammoth Hunters describes the large assemblage of such objects from the sites of Avdeevo. Detailed analysis of the artifacts, and especially of the kinds of deco- ration, has allowed the author to make some suggestions as to the meaning of the objects. This detailed analysis also gives the author firm ground for comparisons between Avdeevo and other sites of the Russian Plain (Kostenki, Khotylevo, Gagarino) and of Central Europe (Willendorf). The book serves therefore both as a description of the finds from Avdeevo, and as an analysis of these finds in the context of the European Upper Palaeolithic. There are actually two sites at Avdeevo: 'Old' Avdeevo, dug from 1946-1949 by Voevodskij and Rogachev, and New Avdeevo, dug by Gvozdover and Grigor'ev since 1972.

According to Gvozdover the temporal correlation between the two sites is not yet clear. The primary aim of this monograph is to describe and analyze worked bone and art objects from both sites: approximately 600 from Old Avdeevo and over 2000 from New Avdeevo. First, though, the author provides a description of the general characteristics of the sites and of their lithic industries, both of which serve to underline the similarity of the Avdeevo sites to the sites at Kostenki. These are considered as not only part of the Kostenki-Avdeevo archaeological culture on the Russian Plain, but as sites belonging to the same stage within that culture: "The absolute similarity of all their components - type of settlement, flint and worked-bone tools, art objects - argues more for total identity than simply for typological affinities... Naturally, we pay most of our attention to Avdeevo, though we would like to stress that it is the Kostenki-Avdeevo culture that we are exam- ining" (p. 1). The examination proceeds from the bone tools (the so-called shovels, adzes, spear points, needle-cases, etc.) through to the fig- urines, describing both the form and the dec- oration of the objects. Some of the artifacts are fascinating, such as those with feline heads and the shovels with two animal heads. An important theme involves the correla- tion between decorative elements and kinds of objects. "The decoration is always charac- terised by the rhythmic alternation and sym- metrical arrangement of its features, making up an ornamental pattern... Each element is confined to its particular place in the decora- tive field... We are sure... that on similar arti- facts there is similar decoration, with the fea- tures arranged according to one and the same scheme... It could be that all elements of the pattern of one implement are equal in mean- ing and mutually interchangeable; if one com- ponent is missing, this does not alter the gen- eral scheme " (pp. 16-17). By studying what decorative elements are found in what combinations and on which objects, Gvozdover is able to propose some underlying meaning for particular elements. Wedge-shaped notching with staggered inter- vals, for instance, "...is typical of female fig- urines" (p. 19). Other artifacts with the same decoration can therefore also be correlated with female images. "We see, therefore, that the shovels with a deviation from the standard at Avdeevo and Kostenki can be united with the female images either by their female dec- oration (Kostenki-I) or by the schematic con- tour of the female body in full face (Avdeevo). The presence of an animal head on some of the shovels, the similar style of both images (of woman and animal) and the similarity of decoration prove the interweav- ing of two central images, and probably their interchangeability or even identity in the Paleolithic human mind" (p. 38). Fourteen female figurines, whole or frag- mentary, are individually described and then analyzed and compared to others from the Russian Plain and from Willendorf. Gvozdover states that the figurines can be divided into different groups, based for instance on posture and on the type of accen- tuation of different body parts (breasts, abdomen, rump, etc.): "the figurines may have been made following different sets of rules (canons).. .the set (totality) of the fig- urines at the site comprises a collection of several types, manufactured according to dif- ferent canons. The range of postures embod- ied in the morphology of the figurines may also have reflected their different functions: thus, the sitting and the standing figurines may have been used in dissimilar rituals and interpreted differently. We believe that each type of figurine had its own semantic mean- ing, which dictated the accentuation and the posture, etc." (p. 34). Having gone this far, however, Gvozdover is unable to make any further suggestions. "The contexts in which the figurines were found... are insufficient for us to arrive at any 164 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 21, 1997</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS final conclusion about the direct usage of the figurines and people's attitude to them" (p. 35). She concludes that the figurines "...are not simply female images, but a set of various symbols used in the image of a woman" (p. 35) - but does not explain what this vague statement might actually mean. Similarly, her treatment of differences and similarities between the artifacts from Kostenki-Avdeevo and other Russian sites such as Gagarino, Molodova V, and Khotylevo-II, and sites in Central Europe (Pavlov, Willendorf, etc.), allows her to pos- tulate that the Kostenki-Avdeevo culture was one of several cultures making up the more amorphous Kostenki- Willendorf unity. This is important and useful information, but she is unable to take it any further. She is forced to conclude her discussion with a rather vague statement about unspecified "...connections and contacts between the Paleolithic popula- tions of Central and Eastern Europe in Gravettian times" (p.51). All in all, the book covers the subject mat- ter in a full and knowledgeable way. Unfortunately the presentation is marred by some annoying flaws, many of which could probably have been avoided through careful editing, which detract from the readability and usefulness of the book. For instance, there is no index. There are problems with the bibliography, such as a reference in the text (p. 38) to The Patterns of Symmetry 1980; 16-18; no author is named, and no such book appears in the bibliography. New sub- jects often start in the middle of paragraphs, which is confusing to the reader. Scale bars are not always shown on drawings and pho- tographs. Most of all, the descriptions of the objects are poorly correlated with the illustra- tions. Figure references often come after the description, so the reader has to skip ahead to the end of the description, find out what fig- ure is being described, find the illustration of that figure, and then go back and read the dis- cussion. Obviously this interrupts the flow of the book. Worse still, the figure numbers given are sometimes wrong: the description could not possibly fit the object shown. The reader has to hunt through the nearby figures, comparing them to the description given. Although most descriptions do refer to the proper figure number, misnumbering occurs frequently enough, all through the book, to be a serious source of frustration to the reader. A little more attention on someone's part when putting the book together could have avoided this problem. In general, this is a book for specialists, and only the most interested of laymen, despite the abundant illustrations. Most of the text consists of very detailed descriptions of individual objects or of decorative elements, which does not make it an easy read. This detailed analysis has however led the author to interesting, well-grounded observations and conclusions, and stimulating suggestions (sometimes more or less convincing) about the Avdeevo material, both on its own and in the context of other sites. Gvozdover's knowledge of the material is very impressive, and it is obvious that she has done a tremendous amount of work on it. Unfortunately, much of the drawing together of the subject is buried in the descriptions: it could stand to be better highlighted. The last few pages of the text specifically deal with the characteristics of Avdeevo art, an attempt to interpret the content of the art of Avdeevo, and the sites of the Kostenki- Willendorf unity on the Russian Plain. These brief sections present interesting correlations and conclu- sions, and prove to the reader that it was worthwhile getting through all the detailed descriptions - but they leave one hoping for more. On the other hand, perhaps the author is to be congratulated for not having gone further than her data can actually take her. The inter- pretations and conclusions are down-to-earth and well supported by the details of the objects. Gvozdover has avoided the far- fetched flights of fancy that sometimes get published as interpretations of Upper Palaeolithic artifacts.
