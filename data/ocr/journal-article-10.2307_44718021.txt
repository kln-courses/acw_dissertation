<plain_text><page sequence="1">750500 NASA General Aviation Research Overview- 1975 Roger L. Winblade and Judy A. Westfall NASA Headquarters THE GENERAL AVIATION technology development program within NASA is directed toward providing technology for the improvement of safety, efficiency, and the minimization of the environmental impact of general aviation. The 1971 Civil Aviation Research and Development Policy Study (CARD) identified general aviation safety as an area for Federal government involvement. While the study did identify noise and emission problems with respect to larger transports, it did not forecast the current levels of public concern over the environmental impact of the general aviation fleet. Since the publication of the CARD report, public concern over general aviation noise and emissions has resulted in the development of international emission levels beyond the capability of current reciprocating engines. Also, the emergence of the fuel sensitive criteria for efficient transportation that has occurred within the last year was not evident at the completion of the CARD Study. The current NASA efforts, in addition to safety, also address the current critical environmental issues and the need for greater cruise efficiency. As illustrated in Fig. 1, specific research and technology developments are under way in aerodynamics, avionics, propulsion, structures and materials, and operations. System study efforts continue as a means of defining future needs. In total, the individual program elements comprise an effort that will provide the technology necessary to meet the stated program objective. SAFETY Tne technical programs directed at improving safety both through aircraft design and through operational procedures are represented in Fig. 2. Improved structural crashworthiness and passenger survival is the objective of a joint NASA-FAA- Industry program that has been underway for two years. During this last year, five full scale crash simulations were conducted. Data from these tests are providing a description of the dynamic response of the aircraft structure under crash impact loads. As part of the full scale tests, the response of instrumented anthropomorphic dummies are providing information on restraint systems and seat structures. Also , emergency crash locator transmitters are carried on each test in an ancillary program to identify the optimum location and actuation thresholds for these devices. In the coming year, the program will continue these tests exploring a wide range of crash impact conditions. The full scale testing schedule provides for over 30 simulated crashes in all. Terminal area operations account for a significant percentage of aircraft accidents. Two separate efforts by NASA have generated the first quantitative data on pilot procedures and aircraft operations in uncontrolled traffic patterns and final approach and landings. Hie data acquisition was completed in 19 74, and reduction and analysis are currently under way. In the future, this data will provide the basis for examining the relationship between specific airplane characteristics and pilot procedures in normal operations . Survey and documentation of the operational loads environment is the subject of a long term NASA program. The data from recorders installed in a wide variety of aircraft throughout the user spectrum is providing both designers and the FAA with a more accurate description of the actual flight loads encountered in routine operations. Emphasis currently is on the reduction and analysis of the over 150,000 h of data collected to date. lhe stall/ spin program also noted on ABSTRACT - An overview of the 1975 NASA Research and Technology efforts directly focused on general aviation is presented. Current status and accomplishments during the past year are described. An updated bibliography of technical reports generated by the NASA program, including seven recently declassified reports on airplane noise reduction, is included as an Appendix to this report. 1312</page><page sequence="2">NASA RESEARCH PROGRAM IN GENERAL AVIATION Fig. 2 is expanded in Fig. 3. Over 2,000 model tests have been completed in the spin tunnel. These data provide the basis for redefining spin and spin recovery design criteria. An additional output of this effort are data for a handbook approach to the design of spin recovery parachutes. The radio controlled model test technique has been developed as a means for examining spin entries and recoveries in free flight. To provide validation of the model data, four different tail configurations are being fabricated for installation and flight testing on a lew wing airplane. The flight program will be implemented during the coming year as will modifications to a high wing airplane for additional testing. A related program started in 1974 is the demonstration of a hydrogen peroxide rocket powered spin recovery system for use in place of the coventional parachute system currently used in spin testing. The multiple use and inflight test capability of such a system should reduce the hazards in the development flight testing of spin characterisitcs . Flight demonstrations will be conducted this year. Aircraft behavior at high angle -of -attack prior to and during the stalí is a significant factor in inadvertent spin entries. A program to examine the range of possible aerodynamic modifications to improve pre- and post-stall behavior was initiated in 1974 and will continue for the next several years. Initial concentration is on modification of the wing lift versus angle-of -attack characteristics to provide more docile stall behavior. EFFICIENCY A modern aerodynamic data base that will permit significant improvements in overall aerodynamic efficiency is the goal of the efforts summarized on Fig. 4. During the past two years, rIASA has significantly increased its emphasis on basic airfoil development. The low speed studies have resulted in a new airfoil, the GAW-1, that shows significant 1313</page><page sequence="3">1314 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A.

Expansion of the point design airfoil into a complete series is under way and is planned to be increased tlirough the use of university wind tunnels. Providing parametric design data in this manner will support the near term needs of the industry, however, the emergence of computational airfoil design techniques holds promise for even greater advances. Significant effort is being directed toward providing realistically sized computer programs that will generate airfoils optimized to the specific requirements of each airplane design, lhe availability of this capability is forecast for the 1978-1979 time period. One step toward the development of an overall approach to aerodynamic drag reduction is the study of engine cooling drag reduction, hie drag resulting from air cooling the flat horizontally opposed engine can be a signifi- cant portion of the total cruise drag of a light airplane. Basic design data on the internal aerodynamics associated with cooling these engines do not exist. Previous work by MCA in the 1930s related to radial engines is not particularly relevant to today1 s engines. One university grant addressing this problem was initiated last year. A more comprehensive joint NASA-University- Indus trv program is currently under consideration. Improvement in the performance of individual aerodynamic components can increase efficiency, have ver, the proper integration into whole configurations can add significantly to total improvement. The Advanced Technology Light Twin (ATLIT) program illustrated in Fig. 5 has reached the flight demonstration phase. The objective of this specific effort is to explore the increases in performance and efficiency that can be achieved through modern aerodynamic wing design. The flight test program, begun in January 1975, will continue tlirough the coming year. In addition to providing flight validation of the wind tunnel predictions of the GAW-1 airfoil performance, the program will determine the practicality of the increased wing loading, spoiler lateral control, and full</page><page sequence="7">1318 R.

Subjective evaluations made during the initial shakedown flights indicate that the design predictions of a 12% increase in cruise speed and a 100% increase in single engine rate of climb will be met or exceeded. Following the trends set by the commercial transports and military aircraft, light aircraft are progressing toward higher levels of automation in flight control and are carrying more sophisticated navigation and communications equipment to keep pace with the air traffic control system. As illustrated by Fig. 6, NASA is exploring several areas that show promise for both reducing growing pilot workload and at the same time increasing the functional capability of the airplane. The efforts in flight control systems ana components include both ends of the spectrum of sophistication. A Beechcraft Model 99 commuter airliner has been modified for flight testing of an advanced attitude command flight control system. The system is implemented using separate and dedicated control surfaces for the automatic systems. Flight test results will be available late this year. At the other end of the spectrum, low cost and reliable sensors for both flight control and cockpit instrumentation are emerging from research in fluidics. Both a hybrid electro- fluidic and an all-fluidic wings leveler autopilot have been flight tested. Very Low Frequency (VLF) navigation is emerging as a promising candidate for general aviation area navigation. Both in -nous e and joint NASA-FAA studies are aimed at definiria the basic signal characteristics and the equipment requirements for this type navigation. As noted in Fig. 6, and expanded in Fig. 7, a major program element in avionics addresses the potential for integrating the large number of functions that must be incorporated into modern aircraft. This program, begun in 1974, will provide both the system design philosophy for efficient integration and identify those areas of component and subsystem technology that will require specific development efforts. Intended for use in tne 1980s timeframe, this approach is based on forecasts of both the future air traffic system requirements and</page><page sequence="8">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1319 ADVANCED AVIONICS SYSTEMS projections of the 1980s state-of-the-art in electronics. Several candidate system concepts will be explored in conjunction with the industry to identify the most desirable approach for mechanization and evaluation both on a ground based simulation and in flight. DWIROMCNTAL IMPACT The environmental impact of general aviation aircraft, in terms of noise and exhaust emissions, as illustrated in Fig. 8, must be reduced to meet existing and proposed environmental standards. The technology to achieve the necessary reductions in a safe and economically viable way does not currently exist . In a joint NAS A-F AA- indus try program, baseline emission characteristics are being determined. Phase II of this joint effort will determine the extent of emission reduction possible through minor modifications to existing engines. A separate joint NASA- Industry program addresses emission reduction potential and fuel efficiency of more significant changes to the basic engines. A related but separate program being planned jointly with an airframe and engine manufactuer is a demonstration of the application of hydrogen enriciiment to an aircraft engine. Current estimates are for at least a 20-50% reduction in fuel consumption over standard engines, in addition to providing significant potential for reduced exhaust emissions. A new program planned for 1975 will address both the noise and emission characteristics of the small turbofan engines. A state-of-the- art small turbofan engine will be used as the starting point in an effort to develop noise reduction technology and advanced combustion concepts. Results of this program will yield design data for an advanced class of engine that will meet all existing and proposed environmental standards. As represented in Fig. 9, progress is being made in NASA* s program to provide data for both reductions in propeller noise and increases in efficiency.

Detailed flight evaluations will be conducted in conjunction with the ATLIT flight program. A modified aircraft incorporating a siirouded propeller was tested in a full scale wind tunnel in 1974. Data were obtained on noise and thrust efficiency of 2, 3, and 5 bladed propellers. During 1975, similar tests will be conducted on the more complex variable pitch ducted fan. Ultimately this program will provide designers with information on tradeoffs over the entire spectrum from free propellers tłirough ducted fans. SUMMARY In summary, the specific technology needs of the general aviation industry are receiving greater emphasis within NASA. During the past several years progress has been made in technical programs that are addressing both current and future needs. The first flights of the ATLIT show the potential for significant increases in efficiency. The crashworthiness program is providing data of near term value as well as pointing toward future improvements in basic structural design procedures. The acceptance and use of the radio controlled model techniques for spin evaluations as well as the incorporation of both the super- critical airfoil and the GAW-l into new airplane developments indicates that the NASA programs are relevant.

An Evaluation of the Handling ^ Qualities of Seven General Aviation ^ Aircarft. Marvin R. Barber, Charles K. Jones, Thomas R. Sisk, and Fred if. Haise, Flight Research Center. A quantitative and qualitative flight- evaluation program has been conducted on seven late-model ganeral aviation aircraft. Tne quantitative portion of this program indicated tiiat the aircraft, as a class, have generally satisfactory stability and control ^ characteri sties . However, these criar act eris it ^ cs are degraded with decreasing airspeed, increasing aft center of gravity, increasing power, and extenstion of gear and flaps. The qualitative portion of the program showed that the handling qualities are generally satisfactory during visual flight and during instrument flight in smooth air. Atmospheric turbulence degrades these handling qualities, with the greatest degradation noted during instrument landing system approaches. Sudi factors as excessive control-system friction, low levels of static stability, high adverse yaw, poor Dutch roll diaracteristics , and control-surface float combine to make precise instrument tracking tasks, in the presence of turbulence, difficult even for experienced instrument pilots. TN D-3970. Effects of a Simple Stability Augmentation System on the Performance of Non-Instrumented-Qualified Light Aiircraft Pilots During Instrument Flight. Norman R. Driscoll, Langley Researdi Center. Many general aviation accidents are attributed to loss of control or disorientation of the non- instrument-rated pilot during an attempt to fly in instrument conditions. Simple low-cost wing-leveling systems are available which show promise of affording a measure of safety in this situation. A flight investigation has been conducted to evaluate the performance characteristics of one such system, and its effect on the capability of trie non- instrument-rated pilot to maintain flight during instrument conditions. Experienced researdi pilots evaluated a medianical-pneumatic rate-gyro-controlled lateral stability augmentation system installed in a retractable gear, low-wing , personal-owner aircraft. The effects of various tilt angles</page><page sequence="12">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1 323 of the gyro-spin-axis on system characteristics were investigated. Tne system was found to be capable of maintaining the aircraft in wings - level flight and on a relatively constant heading. Roll recovery after a disturbance was found to be acceptable; however, a slightly higher roll rate to match the pilot's normal rate during visual flying was desired. Results indicated that a simple pneumatic system will provide acceptable roll-recovery characteristics, with a proper gyro tilt angle. The system was adjudged to be a benefit to the pilot during either visual or instrument cross-country flying. TN D-4664. Wind-Tunnel Study to Explore the Use of Slot Spoilers to Modulate the Flap-Induced Lift of a Wing . Joseph U. Stickle and Robert C. Henry, Langley Research Center. This report presents the results of a preliminary study to explore a proposed new concept for achieving direct lift control on an airplane. Tne concept employs variable-width slot-type spoilers to modulate the increment produced by a deflected flap. Hie study utilized a NACA 2509 constant-chord airfoil model wing modified to provide various size slots on both the wing and flap sections. Each configuration was tested through an angle-of-attach range of- 2 deg to 16 deg in a low-speed Center. Tie tests were conducted at a Reynolds number of approximately 410,000. The results indicate that the use of a variable-width slot is effective in controlling the lift increment obtained from flap deflection and that there is relatively little change in drag coefficient associated with a slot-width change . TN D-4983. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Investigation of Static Longitudinal and Lateral Characteristics of a Light Twin-Engine Airplane. Marvin P. Fink and Delma C. Freeman, Jr. Langley Research Center. An investigation has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characterisitics of a full-scale light twin-engine airplane. Hinge moments were also measured for all control and flap surfaces during the investigation. Tne investigation was made over an angle-of-attack range of -4deg to+18deg at various angles of aids lip between -8 deg for various power and flap settings. The thrust coefficients were 0, 0.20, and 0.44, which correspond to either a low-power or a high-speed condition, to a climb condition, and to a take-off or a wave-off condition, respectively, for an airplane having installed 200 hp/engine. T'í D-5153. Tie Use of Pilot Rating in the Evaluation of Aircraft Handling Qualities. George E. Cooper, /mes Research Center; and Robert P. Harper, Jr. , Cornell Zero- nautical Laboratory. Pilot rating scales and their use in assessing aircraft inandling qualities are reviewed historically, and objections that have been raised to limitations of earlier scales are considered in the development of a revised scale. Terminology used in the evaluation of handling qualities is reviewed and new definitions are proposed to improve communication and international understanding. Of particular significance is the new definition of handling qualities, which emphasizes the importance of factors that influence the selection of a rating other than stability and control characteristics. Tie experimental use of pilot rating is discussed in detail, with special attention devoted to: 1. Clarifying the difference between mission and task, 2. Identifying what the rating applies t0&gt; 3. Considerine the pilot's assessment criteria, and 4. Defining the simulation situation. The important elements of the report are then summarized in a suggested 'Triefing Guide," designed for guidance in planning and executing handling qualities experiments. TN D-5174. Compilation of Data from Related Technologies in the Development of an Optical Pilot Warning Indicator System. Roy Paananen, Keith Gunn, Sej fi Protopapa, Robert Ryan, and Ann Story, Electronics Resecarci 1 Center. The primary goal of the optical PWI system descirbed in this report is to provide both a warning signal and position information to aid a pilot in visually acquiring an intruding aircraft in time to determine what, if any, avoidance procedure is required. A minimum cost of the cooperative element of the system (a xenon lamp) is clearlv a requirement. The desirability of having a visual flash for conspicuity enhancement makes the xenon lamp a very desirable choice as the cooperative element. Tie background radiation and transmission characteristics of the atmosphere, for conditions corresponding to visual flight rules, places the requirement of wide dynamic range on tire detection system. With appropriate temporal and spectral filtering, it appears to be very possible of assuring detection ranges in the order of 3 - 5 miles under all background conditions, except direct viewing into the sun. TN D-5445. A Navigation-Aids Identification Decoder and Display for General Aviation Aircraft. Charles W. Meissner, Jr. , Langley Research Center. A device has been designed to interpret and display the Morse code identifier for VOR</page><page sequence="13">1324 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL stations and other navigation aids. It is intended to reduce trie workload of the general aviation pilot and to aid in safe navigation. A prototype device has been fabricated which can be readily mounted in an aircraft instrument panel. The input signal is obtained from the aircraft audio bus. It in no way affects the operation of other avionic equipment on the aircraft. TN D-5700. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Investigation of the Static Longitudinal and Lateral Characteristics of a Light Single-Engine Airplane . Marvin P. Fink, Delma C. Freeman, Jr., and Douglas Greer, Langley Research Center. A force test investigation has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale, light, single-engine airplane. The investigation was made over an over an angle-of -attach of -4 deg to 20 deg at various angles of sideslip between +_ 8 deg for various power and flap settings. The power conditions were g thrust coefficient T¿1 of zero which represents either a lower- power or a high-speed condition (where the tłirust coefficient approaches zero), T¿1 = 0.20 which corresponds to a climb condition, and T¿ = 0.46 which corresponds to a take-off condition . The investigation showed that the airplane lias stick-fixed longitudinal stability for angles of attack up to and through the stall for all configurations tested with the center of gravity located at 0.10 mean aerodynamic chord. Paver generally has a small destabilizing effect but the airplane is statically stable even with the most rearward cent er-of -gravity location. The airplane is directionally stable and has positive effective dihedral through the stall for all conditions tested. Hie aileron and rudder effectiveness was maintained through the stall and was powerful enough to trim out all airplane moments tlirough the stall. TN D-5767. A Statistical Study of Normal Load Factor Just Prior to Ground Contact for Five Light Airplanes. Albert W. Kail, Langley Research Center. A statistical study of the values of normal load factor just prior to ground contact is presented for landings of five light airplanes . These data were obtained by measurements of normal acceleration from VGH records of a total of 980 landings of the five different types of light airplanes . Frequency-distribution curves and probability curves were fitted to the samples of data for each plane. Hie results indicate tliat the normal load factor just prior to ground contact varied from 0.70 to 1.20 for the total data sample of all five airplanes. The distributions of normal load factor for each airplane had mean values ranging from 0.962 to 1.013 with standard deviations ranging from 0.039 to 0.074. The probability that the normal load factor just prior to landing would be significantly less than 1.00 was greater for four of the five light airplanes tiian the piston-engine transport airplanes of a previous study. TN D-5857. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Investigation of the Static Longitudinal and Lateral Characterisitcs of a Light Single-Engine Low-Wing Airplane. James P. Shivers, Marvin P. Fink, and George M. Ware, Langley Research Center. A wind- tunnel investigation has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a light single-engine airplane. The investigation was made over an angle-of-attack range of -4 deg to 22 deg at various angles of sideslip between 15 deg and -15 deg for various power and flap settings. The power conditions were T' = 0.03 which represents a cruise condition oř about 70r¿ power and T!ä* 0.23 which corresponds to a full po&amp;er climb conditions (where T! is thrust coefficient). Thecinvestigation showed that the airplane lias stick-fixed longitudinal stability for angles of attack up to and through the stall for all configurations tested with the center of gravity at 0.25 mean aerodynamic chord. Power generally liad a small destabilizing effect. The airplane is directionally stable and has positive effective dihedral through the stall for all test conditions. The aileron and rudder effectiveness was maintained tlirough the stall and was powerful enough to trim out all airplane rolling and yawing moments through the stall. IN D-5890. Evaluation of the Effect of a Yaw-Rate Damper on the Flying Qualities of a Light TWin-Engine Airplane. Calvin R. Jarvis, Paul C. Loschke, and Einar K. Enevoldson, Flight Research Center. A simple, parallel yaw damper and aileron- to-rudder interconnect was tested in flight in a light twin-engine airplane to evaluate the improvement that might be achieved in the overall flying qualities of a general aviation airplane in turbulence. Fifteen pilots participated in the evaluation program. Both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained for evaluation of lateral-directional characteristics. The yaw damper significantly reduced the short-period lateral-directional motions of the test airplane in turbulent air. This resulted in an improvement in both the ride and the flying qualities. The improvement in the pilot* s overall performance of the ILS approach task was not significant. Tne aileron-to-rudder interconnect was found to be effective in compensating for</page><page sequence="14">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1325 adverse aileron yaw, and turns could be made easier and more accurately. An increase in the intensity of the lateral motions of the test airplane in turbulence was experienced when the autopilot system was used alone, lhe autopilot performance in turbulence was significantly improved when the system was used with the yaw damper. Maximum roll and yaw rates encountered during stall maneuvers were reduced when the yaw damper was operating. Also, the available time for corrective action following a simulated engine failure was effectively doubled when the yaw damper was engaged. TN D- 6 2 10. Flight Evaluation of Angle of Attadc as a Control Parameter in General Aviation Aircraft. Shu W. Gee, Harold G. Gaidsick, and Einar K. Enevoldson, Flight Research Center. Tne use of angle-of- -attack information for a pilot T s display in a general aviation airplane was investigated to determine whether this form of information would improve perfor- mance and flight safety. An angle -of -at tack system consisting of a wing-mounted vane, an electronic computer unit, and a display instrument was installed and flight tested in a typical twin-engine, general aviation airplane. Tne flight-test maneuvers were limited to the low-speed flight region where the benefits of angle-of -attadc presentation were likely to be greatest. Some of the expected advantages of this parameter, such as visual indication of stall margin and its independence of gross weight and flap position, were realized; however, certain aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane, such as the phugoid and directional-control capability, were found to limit and tended to negate some of the expected advantages. As a result, this use of angle-of-attack did not show a significant improvement in performance and flight safety. TN D-6238. A Wind-Tunnel Investigation of Static Longitudinal and Lateral Characterisitcs of a Full-Scale Mockup of a Light Twin-Engine Airplane. Marvin P. Fink, James P. Shivers, and Criarles C. Smith, Jr. , Langley Research Center. An investigation łias been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale mockup of a light twin-engine airplane. Hinge moments were measured on all control surfaces during the investigation, downwash surveys were made at the horizontal tail, and several tests were made to determine the effect of simulated ice or, the longitudinal characteristics. Tne investigation was made over an angle-of-attack range of -4 deg to 24 deg at various angles of sideslip between +8 deg for various power and flap settings. Tie thrust coefficients were 0, 0.19, and 0.28, which correspond to either a low-power or a high-speed condition (where the thrust coefficient approaches zero) , to a climb condition, and to a take-off or wave-off condition, respectively, for an airplane having an installed power of 260 hp (194 kW) per engine. The investigation showed that, in general, the model had stick-fixed longitudinal stability through the stall, but a stick- free instability7 could be encountered at some lift coefficients with an aft cent er-of -gravity location. Tie model was directionally stable and had positive effective dihedral for angles of attack up tlirough the stall, although the effective dihedral varied somewhat with angle of attack for different power and flap conditions. Aileron and rudder effectiveness was maintained through the stall and with asymmetric power, the controls were capable of trimming the mockup up to angles of attack through the stall. Tne model had a fairly symmetrical stall and displayed no tendency for large rolling or yawing moments at the stall. TJ D-6272. Compilation of Xenon Flash Tube Data for Pilot Warning Indicator Systems. Robert Gagnon and Antłiony R. Lewis, Electronics Research Center. To provide design data for Pilot Warning Indicator (PWI) systems, we measured the characteristics of six types of xenon strobe lamps (14 units) built to operate as aircraft beacons and one type of xenon strobe lamp (2 units) which was not designed for tiiat purpose. Flash lamp output was measured with a radiometer (EGSG model 580-23A), factory-calibrated against a secondary standard. Four filters (centrai wavelengths 0.825, 0.876, 0.927, and 0.974¿gn) were used to obtain more detailed spectral characteristics. Properties determined for each lamp were: pulse shape, pulse width, pulse rise time, lamp steradiancy, peak irradiance , peak radiant intensity , peale optical power, average optical power, optical energy output, and conversion efficiency. TI D-6345. Analytic Studies of Sound Pressure Inside the Duct of Ducted Propellers. Joseph A. Drischler, Langley Research Center. The sound-pressure field of a rotating ducted propeller in forward flight is analyzed by replacing the duct by an infinite coaxial circular cylinder and assuming that the blade- loading distribution associated with the thrust and the torque can be represented by a distribution of acoustic pressure doublets acting at the propeller disk. I'rend studies are made to ascertain the effect on the pressure distribution inside the duct of variations in propeller loading, tip clearance, free-stream Mach number, tip Mach number, and hub-tip ratio. The effect on the pressure distribution of concentrating the loading at various radial</page><page sequence="15">1326 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL positions on the propeller blade is also investigated . TN D-6389 . A Digitally Controlled Very High Frequency Synthesizer. Joan H. Middleton, Langley Research Center. A digitally controlled frequency snythesizer, which can replace the multicrystal local oscillator in a general aviation navigation receiver, is described. The development of this snythesizer resulted from an effort to find less expensive and more reliable methods for generating local oscillator frequencies than is currently available by using the multicrystal technique. The synthesizer employs a phase- locked loop in which the output of a VCO (voltage-controlled oscillator) is digitally divided and phase locked to a stable reference frequency. A new tedinique is used to accomplish, the dividing. Because it is digital, the synthesizer lends itself readily to computer control. A breadboard model of the synthesizer is described.

The braking performance of a nine-place, light, twin-engine airplane was evaluated on comparative grooved and ungrooved surfaces on the landing research runway at NASA Wallops Station. The test airplane was equipped with manual braking on the tricycle landing gear, and its wieght varied from 33.4 to 35.6 kN (7500 to 0000 lb). The test results indicate that pavement grooving significantly improves aircraft braking and directional control on wet runways. Measurements and observations of airplane tire treads made during this test program showed no indication of unusual wear and/or damage attributable to grooved surfaces. Comparative braking data obtained with a jet fignter and a civil and military jet transport are also presented. TN' D-6531. Comparison of Several Methods for Estimating Low-Speed Stability Derivatives for Two Airplane Configurations. Herman S. Fletcher, Langley Research Center. Methods presented in five different publications have been used to estimate the low-speed stability derivatives of two unpowered airplane configurations. One configuration had unswept lifting surfaces; the other configuration was the D-558-II swept -wing research airplane. The results of the computations were compared with each other, with existing wind-tunnel data, and with flight-test data from the D-558-II configuration to assess the relative merits of the methods for estimating derivatives. The results of the study indicated that, in general, for low subsonic speeds, no one text appeared consistent- ly better for estimating all derivatives. TN D-6573. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Tests of a Small Unpowered Jet Aircraft with a T-Tail. Paul T. Soderman and Thomas N. Aiken, Ames Research Center. The aerodynamic characteristics of a full scale executive type jet transport aircraft with a T-tail were investigated in the Ames 40 X 80 ft (12.2 X 24.4 m) Wind Tunnel (subsonic). Static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics were determined at angles of attack from -2 deg to +42 deg. The aircraft wing had 13 deg of sweep end an aspect ration of 5.02. Tne aircraft was tested power off with various wing leading-and trailing-edge high-lift devices. The basic configuration was tested with and without sudi components as engine nacelles, wing tip tanks and empannage. Hinge-moment data were obtained and downwash angles in the horizontal-tail plane location were calculated. The data were obtained at Reynolds numbers of 4.1 x 10° and 8.7 x 10 based on wing mean aerodynamic diord. The model had static longitudinal stability through initial stall. Severe tail buffet occurred near the angle of attack for maximum lift. Above initial stall the aircraft had pronounced pitch-up , characteristic of T-tail configurations. A stable trim point was possible at angles of attadc between 30 deg and 40 deg (depending on e.g. location and flap setting). Hinge-moment data showed no regions that would result in adverse effects on stick force. Comparisons of wind-tunnel data and flight-test data are presented. TN D-6575. Summary of Spin Technology as Related to Light General Aviation Ahrplanes. James S. Bowman, Jr. Langley Research Center. A summary has been made of all the NASA, (and NACA) research and experience related to the spin and recovery characteristics of light personal-owner type general aviation airplanes. Very little of the research deals with light general aviation airplanes, as such, but many of tire airplanes and models tested prior to, and during, World War II were similar to presént day light general aviation airplanes with regard to the factors tiiat are important in spinning. The present paper is based mainly on the results of spin-tunnel tests of free-spinning dynamically-scaled models of about 100 different airplane designs and includes correlation with full-scale spin tests wherever possible. Tne research results are discussed in terms of airplane design considerations and the proper use of controls for recovery. TN D-6643. Aerodynamic Parameters of the Navion Airplane Extracted from Flight Data. William T. Suit.</page><page sequence="16">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1327 An iterative method, which is characterized as a miximum-likelihood minimum-variance tech- nique, was used to extract the aerodynamic parameters of a Navion airplane from flight data, lhe purposes were to compare the results with parameters obtained by analog matching the same data, and to develop techniques for application of the parameter extraction program. Results from the study showed that the parameter-extraction program can produce aerodynamic parameters which will permit close estimation of the aircraft time histories used in the extraction process. Hie program determined an estimate of the standard deviations of the states and parameters. These estimates were used to indicate how well the calculated states fit the flight data and the confidence in the values of the estimated parameters. The study also showed that the values of the parameters were affected by the data and mathematical model used during the extraction process. ¡Because of the lack of confidence in the parameters extracted by use of some of the sets of data, several parameters were estimated by other methods. By using a combination of methods, a set of parameters which gave a fit to the data was obtained. TN D-6655. Exploratory Flight Investigation of Aircraft Response to the Wing Vortex Wake Generated by Jet Transport Aircraft. William H. Andrews , Glenn H. Robinson, and Richard R. Larson. Flight Research Center The effect of intercepting wing tip vortices generated by large jet transports, including jumbo jets, over separation distances from 1.85 km (1 n. mile) to 27.78 km (15 n. miles) is evaluated on the basis of the response of a vortex probe airplane in the roll mode. The vortex probe test aircraft included a representative general aviation airplane, an executive jet, a fighter, and light and medium weight jet transports. The test conditions and airplane configurations were comparable to those normally used during takeoff, landing or holding pattern operations. For flight safety the tests were performed at altitudes from 2896 m (9500 ft) to 3810 m (12,500 ft). In addition to an evaluation of the probe airplane response, a flight test technique is suggested for determining minimum separation distance, using as variables the ratio of vortex- induced roll acceleration to maximum lateral control acceleration and the gross weight of the generating aircraft.

TN D-6866 . Summary of Design Considerations for Airplane Spin- Recovery Parachute Systems. Sanger M. Burk, Jr. Langley Research Center. A compilation of design considerations applicable to spin-recovery parachute systems has been made so that the information will be readily available to those responsible for the design of such systems. The information was obtained from a study of available documents and from discussions with persons in both government and industry experienced in paraci iute design, full-scale and model spin testing, and related systems. This survey indicated that the technology was best defined for tactical and trainer military airplanes, and was not considered applicable to other classes of airplanes, especially light general aviation airplanes. Even for the military airplanes, however, there are gaps in the technology where one must rely on the judgment of experts based on their related experience. Hence, the present paper is not a handbook for the design of spin-recovery parachute systems, but is simply a summary of the status of the tedino logy and a discussion of approadies that liave proven successful or unsuccessful in the past. Cne main conclusion evolves from this summary, tiiat is, there are txiree distinct fields of technology involved: parad íutes, airplane spinning, and airplane systems. Specialists in all these fields should be consulted or participate in the design of the spin-recovery paradiute system from the very beginning. TN D-6896. The Effects of Configuration granges on the Aerodynamic Characteristics of a Full-Scale ¡lockup of a ^ Light Twin-Engine Adrplane. Marvin ^ P. Fink, James P. Shivers, and H. Douglas Greer. A force test investigation lias been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the aerodynamic diaract eristics of a full-scale mockup of a light twin-engine airplane for several engine nacelle shapes , modes of propeller rotation, orientation of the thrust axis, and of a change of airfoil section of the wing . The investigation was made over an angle-of -attack range of -4 deg to 20 deg at various angles of sideslip between +8 deg for various power and flap settings. Tie power conditions were a thrust coefficient of zero, whidi represents either a low power</page><page sequence="17">1328 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL or a iiigii speed condition (where the thrust coefficient approaches zero), Q.20 which corresponds to a climb condition, and 0.44 which corresponds to a take-off condition. Tne investigation showed that maior configuration changes sucri as nacelle shape and wing section, and lesser changes in the cowl and nacelle afterbody generally did not result in significant changes in either the longitudinal or lateral aerodynamic character- istics. It appears from this investigation that the aerodynamic characteristics of this particular configuration are mainly a function of mode of propeller rotation, slipstream energy, ¿and flap deflection. Certain combinations of these factors significantly affected the high-lift characteristics and longitudinal stability. These same factors are ¿also apparently very important in determining the following moment characteristics, particularly at and above the stall. TN D-6926. Analytical Prediction of Aircraft Equilibrium- Spin Characteristics . William IT. Adams, Jr. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved algebraically for conditions for which an aircraft is in an equilibrium spin. Constrained minimization techniques are employed in obtaining the solution. Linear characteristics of the aircraft about the equilibrium points are also presented and their significance in identifying the stability characteristics of the equilibrium points is discussed. Computer time requirements ¿ire small, making the method appear potentially applicable in aircraft design. Results are obtained for several configura- tions and are compared with other analytical/ numerical methods employed in spin prediction. Correlation with experimental results is discussed for the configuration for which a rather extensive data base was available. A need is indicated for higher Reynolds number data taken under conditions which more accurately simulate a spin. TN D-6946.

Design and Cold-Air Investigation of a Turbine for a Small Low-Cost Turbofan Engine. Milton G. Kofskey and William J. Nusbaum. Lewis Research Center. An experimental investigation of a two-stage, 2U.32 cm (8 in) mean-diameter turbine was made to determine the performance level over a range of speeds and pressure ratios. The turbine was designed to drive the compressor and fan of a low-cost turbo fan engine suitable for light aircraft application. Included in the report are design information and first-stage and two-stage performance results with cold air as the working fluid. Tests were made at speeds from 0 to 110% of equivalent design speed and pressure ratios from 1.79 to 5.14. The results of the investigation indicated that, for two-stage operation, static and total efficiencies were 0.82 and 0.93, respectively. Tne se values are significantly higher than 0.780 and 0.880 assumed in the design. It should be pointed out that these higher efficiencies would not necessarily be expected to be obtained in actual engine operation. Losses due to nonuniform turbine-inlet conditions, increased interstage leakage, and increased tip clearance could result in efficiencies closer to the design values. The equivalent mass flow is about 0.8% larger than design at equivalent design speed and pressure ratio with two-stage operation. At this design point operation, first-and second- stage total efficiencies were 0.93 and 0.91. TIT D-7109. Effect of Reynolds Number and Engine Nacelles on the Stalling Character- istics of a Model of a TWin-Engine Light Airplane. Vernard E. Lockwood. Langley Research Center. An investigation has been made in the Langley low-turbulence pressure tunnel to determine the effect of Reynolds number on the stall characteristics of a 1/18-scale model of a twin-engine light airplane. The investigation was made at Mach number from about 0.2Rover a Reynolds number range from 0.39 x 10 to 3.7 x KT', based on the reference chord. Static longitudinal, lateral, and directional characteristics were obtained with and without twin nacelles. Tie investigation showed that maximum lift coefficients increased with Reynolds number with the nacelles on or off. The presence of the nacelles on the model caused a reduction in lift at all Reynolds numbers. Tne maximum lift coefficients of the model without nacelles agreed favorably with results obtained on a version of the full-scale single-engine airplane, but the lift coefficients for the model with nacelles on were less than those obtained on the twin-engine airplane. Tie configuration with and without nacelles were longitudinally stable, the tail providing large pitch-down moments above maximum lift. The model with the nacelles off liad positive dihedral effect (negative values of ) throughout the angle-of -attack and Reynolds number range of the investigation; and the model with the nacelles on had a positive dihedral effect at low Reynolds numbers of</page><page sequence="18">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1 329 approximately 3 x 10 6 and at angles of attack greater than 8 deg, the model had a negative dihedral effect. These results are in qualitative agreement with those obtained in previous tests of the full-scale airplanes. The model possessed directional stability with nacelles on and off. TN D-7149. A Wind- Tunnel Investigation of the Static Longitudinal and Lateral Characterisitics of a Full-Scale Mockup of a Light Single -Engine High-Wing Airplane. H. Douglas Greer, James P. Shivers, and Marvin P. Fink. Langley Research Center; and C. Robert Carter. U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Laboratory. A force test investigation has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale mockup of a light single-engine high-wing airplane. Hinge moments were measured on all control surfaces during the investigation, and downwash surveys were made at the horizontal tail. Hie investigation was made over an angle-of~attack range of -4 deg to 24 deg at various angles of sideslip between +8 deg for various power and flap settings. Tne power conditions were a thrust coefficient T^ of zero which represents either a low-power or a high-speed condition (where the thrust coefficient approaches zero), Tł = 0.14 which corresponds to a climb cofidition, and Tf = 0.30 which corresponds to a takeoff cSndition. The investigation showed that the model has both stick-fixed and stick-free longitudinal stability through the stall for all configurations tested with the center of gravity located at 1.37% mean geometric chord. Power generally has a small destabilizing effect, but at worst the model could become no more than neutrally stable with the center of gravity as far aft as 40% of the mean geometric chord. The model has positive effective dihedral and directional stability for all test conditions. The aileron and rudder effectiveness was maintained up to the stall and was powerful enough to trim out all model moments up to the stall. TN D-7278. A Study of a Control System to Alleviate Aircraft Response to Horizontal and Vertical Gusts. William K. Phillips. Langley Research Center. A study is made of the longitudinal response of a STOL airplane equipped with a vane-controlled gust-alleviation system. Effects of various combinations of design parameters on the responses to horizontal and vertical gusts and to elevator inputs are presented. Almost complete gust alleviation may be obtained with this system at rearward center-of -gravity locations, but pitch stability augmentation is required for satisfactory control characteristics . TN D-73G9. An Improved Method for Design of Expansion- Chamber Mufflers with Application to an Operational Helicopter. Tony L. Parrott. Lnngley Research Center. An improved method for the design of expansion-chamber mufflers is described and applied to the task of reducing exhaust noise generated by a helicopter. The method is an improvement of standard transmission-line theory in that it accounts for the effect of the mean exhaust -gas flow on the acoustic- transmission properties of a muffler system, including the termination boundary condition. Tne method has been computerized, and the computer program includes an optimization procedure that adjusts muffler component lengths to achieve a minimum specified desired transmission loss over a specified frequency range. A printout of the program is included together with a user-oriented description. A field test of a muffler designed with the aid of this method was conducted on a helicopter with a known exhaust -noise problem. When the exhaust noises of the helicopter with a standard exhaust system and a similar helicopter with a muffler system installed were compared for hover flight conditions, the muffler system was found to reduce the exhaust noise by approximately 11 dB (A). No significant degradation in the engine performance was observed. TO D-7315. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Investigation of Effects of Slot Spoilers on the Aerodynamic Characteristics of a Light Twin-Engine Airplane. Harry A Verstynen, Jr. and Dominick Andrisani II. Langley Research Center . A wind-tunnel investigation has been conducted to determine the effects of slot spoilers on the longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic characteristics of a full-scale mockup of a light twin-engine airplane. Hie slots were 5.08 cm (2.0 in) wide , covered 82% of the flap of the model, and were located just aft of the leading edge of the flap. The slots were used to modulate flap-induced lift as a possible means of direct lift control. The data showed that opening the slots decreased the lift coefficient, decreased the drag coefficient, and increased the pitching-moment coefficient (nose up) . The maximum effectiveness of the slots, which was at angles of attack of 6 deg to 8 deg resulted in a decrease in lift coefficient of about 0.32, or approximately 82% of the flap-induced lift. Opening the slots had a slight stabilizing effect on the longitudinal stability of the model and no effect on the lateral stability. As might be expected for a reduction in lift, opening the slots</page><page sequence="19">1330 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL decreased the average downwash angle at the tail. The data also showed that the rolling moment created by a full asymmetric slot condition is about one-half the roll-control power available on the basic model. TO D-7428. Low-Speed Aerodynamic Characteristics of a 17 -Percent' -Thick Airfoil Section Designed for General Aviation Applications . Robert J. McGhee and William D. Beasley. Langley Research Center. An investigation was conducted in the Langley low-turbulence pressure tunnel to determine the low-speed two-dimensional aerodynamic characteristics of a 17% thick airfoil designed for general aviation applications. The results are compared with a typical older LACA 65 series airfoil section. Also, a comparison between experimental data and predictions, based on a theoretical method for calculating the viscous flow about the airfoil, is presented. The tests were conducted over a Mach number range from 0.1Q to 0.28 and an angle-of -attack range from -10 deg to 24 deg. Reynolds numbers, based on the airfoil chord, were varied from about 2.0 to 106 to 20.0 x 106. Tne results of the investigation indicate that maximum section lift coefficients increased rapidly at Reynolds numbers from about 2.0 x 10^ to 6.0 x 10 6 and attained values greater than 2.0 for the plain airfoils and greater than 3.0 with a 20% chord split flap deflected 60 deg% Stall characteristics were generally gradual and of the trailing-edge type either with or without the split flap. At a lift coefficient of 1.0 (climb condition) the section lift-drag ratio increased from about 65 to 85 as the Reynolds number increased from about 2.0 x 10^ to 6.0 x 10". Maximum section lift coefficients were about 30% greater than that of a typical older MACA 65 series airfoil section and the section lift-drag ratio at a lift coefficient of 0.90 was about 50% greater. Agreement of experimental results with predictions based on a theoretical method which included viscous effects was good for the pressure distributions as long as no boundary-layer flow separation was present, but the theoretical method predicted drąg values greatly in excess of the measured values. TO D-7431. Analytical Study of the Performance of a Gust Alleviation System with a Vane Sensor. Waldo I. Oehman. Langley Research Center. A 5670 kg airplane is assumed to be cruising with an airspeed of 109 m/sec at 3048 m altitude. It is also assumed that the airplane is flying in turbulent air characterized by a Von Karman power spectral density function. Analysis has shown that a vane-controlled gust alleviation system (system I) in the airplane can reduce the normal acceleration at the airplane center of gravity by 76%. The response to gusts of an angle-of -attack vane (the vane is located ahead of the wing) is fed simul- taneously to the flap and elevator servos to provide alleviation . The signal to the servos is filtered so that required flap deflection rates are not too large. Also, another system (system II) uses a filter at the elevator servo to compensate for the time lead between vane response and elevator movement. This alleviation system has been effective in increasing the alleviation by 2.5% and 5% at stations 1 and 2 mean aerodynamic chords behind the airplane center of gravity, respectively , as compared to system I. Tne vane-controlled alleviation systems of the present study give better alleviation than did the accelerometer-controlled system of a previous study. However, the comparison is valid only for the assumptions made in both studies. Other factors should be considered in future work so that better judgment of both types of system can be made.

Tne concept of a simplified head-up display referred to as a Landing-Site Indicator (LASI) for use in lightplanes iš discussed. Results of a fixed-base simulation study exploring the feasibility of the LASI concept are presented in terms of measurements of pilot performance, control-activity parameters, and subjective comments of four test subjects. These subjects, all of whom had various degrees of piloting experience in this type aircraft, performed a series of simulated landings both with and without the LASI starting from different initial conditions in the final approach leg of idre landing maneuver. Tre results indicated a general, although not unqualified, acceptance of the LASI concept by the test subjects and demonstrated some beneficial effects accruing fron its use. Tie results showed generally tJnat its use reduced the magnitude and the variations of the pilot performance and control-activity parameters tiiat were measured. TO D-7460. Development and Flight Tests of a Gyro-Less Wing Leveler and Directional Autopilot. H. Douglas Garner and Harold E. Poole. Langley Research Center. A gyro-less wing leveler and directional autopilot were developed and flight tested in a single-engine light airplane. The primary purpose of this project was to develop a simple, reliable, low-cost stability augmentation and autopilot system for light aircraft. The wing leveler used a fluidic inertial rate sensor, electronic signal processing circuitry and vacuum-operated servos. A strap-down magnetic heading reference of simple design was developed to provide the wing leveler with directional autopilot capability. Flight tests indicated tliat the performance of the gyro-less</page><page sequence="20">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1331 wing leveler was equal to that of a commercial wing leveler using a gyroscopic rate sensor. Drift-free, long-term heading-hold capability of the magnetic heading reference was demonstrated. TN D-7474. Wind-Tunnel Tests of a Full-Scale Model of a Light TWin-Engine Airplane with a Fixed Auxiliary Airfoil or a Leading-Edge Slot. Marvin P. Fink, James P. Shivers, and Lucy White. Langley Research Center. An investigation lias been conducted by means of wind-tunnel tests of a full-scale mockup of a light twin-engine airplane configuration to determine the effects of outboard partial-span slots and of auxiliary airfoils ¿ahead of the leading edge of the wing in improving aerodynamic cliaracteristics at high angles of attack. Small-scale tests of full-span models of such leading-edge stall-control devices many years ago had indicated an increase in the stall angle of the airfoil of about 8 deg with a very minimal increase in minimum drag, which would be of paramount interest for high-speed cruise. The object of the present investigation was to determine the extent of the improvements that could be obtained in the 3 -dimensional case of application of these devices only on the outboard part of the wing. Tests were made for a range of power settings for both flaps -up and flaps-down conditions. Both of the stall-control devices gave considerable improvement in high angle-of -attach characteristics with the auxiliary airfoil giving the more favorable results, but neither device performed as well as might have been expected. The slot delayed the stall of the outboard part of the wing about 5 deg or 6 deg, flattened or extended the top of the lift curve, and caused the ailerons to maintain full effectiveness to about 5 deg higher angle of attack. But the slot increased the minimum drag of the model about 10%, and did not diminish the large asymmetric rolling moments at the stall. The auxiliary airfoil also provided a flat-topped lift curve and improved aileron effectiveness at high angles of attack, it actually decreased the value of minimum drag slightly, and it reduced by about one-half the large asymmetric rolling moments at the stall. Tuft tests, however, indicated little delay in the stall of the outboard part of the wing, so that it might be questioned whether damping in roll would be maintained at the higher angles of attack.

Flight Research Center. A flight-test program was conducted with a light twin-engine airplane to determine the effect of advanced flight control systems and displays on the łiandling qualities of this class of aircraft. A flight -director display and an attitude -command control system used sep¿arately and in combination, transformed a vehicle with poor handling qualities during ILS approaches in turbulent air into a vehicle with extremely good handling qualities. The attitude-command control system also improved the ride qualities of the airplane. A rate-command control system provided only small benefit in improving ILS łiandling qualities in turbulence. Both rate and attitude -command control systems reduced stall warning of the test airplane which could increase the likelihood of an inadvertent stall. The final approach to flare point was improved with both rate and attitude-command systems. However, small control wheel deflections necessary to flare were unnatural and tended to cause over- control during flare. Airplane handling qualities are summarized for each control system and display configuration. TO D-7775. Lightning Damage to a General Aviation Aircraft - Description and Analysis. Paul T. Hacker. Lewis Research Center. The damage sustained by a Beechcraft King Air Model B90 aircraft by a single lightning discharge is presented and analyzed. The incident occurred during landing approach at Jackson, MI on Feb. 19, 1971. In addition to the usual melted-metal damage at the lightning attachment points, there was severe implosion-type damage over a large area on the lower right side of the aircraft and impact-and crushing-type damage on the upper and lower surfaces on the left wingtip near the trailing edge. Analyses indicate that the implosion-type dćamage was probably caused by lightning-generated shock waves, that the impact-and crushing-type damage was caused by magnetic forces, and that the lightning discharge was ¿ multiple strike with at least 11 strokes separated in time by about 4.5 ms. The evidence indicates that the lightning discharge was rather different from the average in character and severity. TO D-7928. Pilot Preference and Procedures at Uncontrolled Airports. Loyd C.

Effect of Forward Contour Modification on the Aerodynamic Characteristics of the NACA 64^-212 Airfoil Section. Raymond M. Hicks, Joel P. Mendoza, Angelo Bandettini. Ames Research Center. Itoo different forward contour modifications designed to increase the maximum lift coefficient of the IÍACA 64j-212 airfoil section were evaluated experimentally at low speeds. One modification consisted of a slight droop of the leading edge with an increased leading edge radius v;hile the other modification incorporated increased thickness over the forward 35% of the upper surface of the profile. Both modified airfoil sections were found to provide substantially higher maximum lift coefficients than the 64ļ-212 section. Hie drooped leading edge modification incurred a drag penalty of approximately 10% at low and moderate lift coefficients and exhibited a greater nosedown pitching moment than the 641-212 profile. The upper surface modification produced about the same drag level as the 64^-212 section at low and moderate lift coefficients and less nose-down pitching moment than the 64^-212 profile. Both modified airfoil sections had lower drag coefficients than the 64^-212 section at high lift coefficients.

Shu W. Gee and Robert C. McCracken, Flight Research Center. A diamond, sized to appear equidimensional when viewed from a 0.0628 rad (3.6 deg) glideslope , vias painted on the end of a small general aviation airport runway, and a series of flights were made to evaluate its usage as a piloting aid. Twenty Fedeml Aviation Administration (FAA) certified pilots were used as test subjects and each flew five approaches and landings with the diamond, and five without it. The pilots could detect and fly reasonably close to the glideslope projected by the diamond. Tne flight path oscillations that were recorded during approaches using the diamond were not significantly different from the oscillations that were recorded without the diamond, the difference that did exist could be attributed to converging on a known projected glideslope in one case, and flying an unknown, random glideslope in the other. The results indicated tliat the diamond would be effective as a means of intercepting and controlling a predetermined glideslope. Other advantages of the diamond were positive runway identification and greater aim point visibility. Tne major disadvantage was a tendency to overconcentrate on the diamond and consequently to neglect cockpit instruments and airport traffic. TMX 3008. Flight Investigation of the VFR and IFR Landing Approach Characteristics and Terminal Area Airspace Requirements for a Light STOL Airplane. Harold L. Crane, Kenneth R. Yenni, and Bruce D. Fisher.

Simulated (hooded) instrument landing approaches were made using steep single segment and two segment glideslopes. A brief investigation was also made of the visual flight terminal area capabilities of the aircraft. The results indicated that the airplane could be flown on a 7 deg ILS type approach in still air with an adequate 3 deg margin for downward correction. With modified guidance for the instrument approach, the light STOL aircraft could be flown on an approach pattern with a final leg less than one-third as long as on the current ILS, requiring only two-thirds the time of the current large jet transports.</page><page sequence="22">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1 333 HiX 3096. Landing Approach Evaluation of an Integrated CRT Display for General Aviation Aircraft. Peter D. Talbot, Ames Research Center; and Glen W. Stinnett, Jr., U.S. Army Air Mobility R&amp;D Laboratory. A flight director adaptable to general aviation aircraft was evaluated for the landing approach task in a twin turbojet business aircraft. The flight director combined aircraft heading, pitch and roll attitude, and ILS (Instrument Landing System) signals into a single picture on a small cathode ray tube (CRT) to give the pilot an integrated picture of the aircraft situation, lhe display is unique in that it presents the information on a CRT and gives quasi-command signals to the pilot. Tne particular display investigated was a preproduction version of the Kaiser Model FP-50 flight director. Approaches made with visual references only, with a conventional ILS displacement instrument, and with the CRT display were compared in terms of tracking performance and pilot workload. Tracking performance of three research pilots using the CRT display was superior to that using the conventional ILS instrument and comparable to that under VFR conditions. Pilot workload (based on pilot comments) was not clearly decreased. TMX 62368. Propeller Modulation Effects on a Scanning Beam Microwave Landing System. Jack M. Pope, Ames Research Center; and William II. Staehle, Raytheon Company. This report presents the results of an investigation to assess the modulation effects on microwave signals transmitted tlirough rotating propeller blades. Interruption of the antenna 'Tine-of -sight'' signal by the rotating propeller causes a variation of path loss, which produces essentially an amplitude modulation of the received signal. This interruption of blockage effect is generally only partial because of edge diffraction around the particular interfering propeller blade. Signals reflected from the rotating propeller will also cause Doppler frequency shifts to be present in the received signals. A scanning beam microwave landing system (MLS) known as MODI LS (modular instrument landing system) was used to process the received signals for display. The effects of propeller modulation were studied by varying the following parameters : 1. Spacing between propeller and receiving antenna 2 . Propeller dimensions 3. Propeller speed (rpm) 4. Number of propeller blades 5. System data rate 6. Receiver response time 7. Receiver antenna aperture TMX 69455. General Aviation Air Traffic Pattern Safety Analysis. Loyd C. Parker, Wallops Station.

The system consisted essentially of the outer portions of each wing being hinged in the chordwise direction ^ and connected directly to the wing flaps using ^ internal counter weights to provide neutral mass balance. Wnen the wing experienced a change in velocity of angle of attack, the movable wing panels, acting as sensors and flap actuators, deflected in response to the changes in lift on the wing. The corresponding move- ments of the interconnected flaps tended to reduce the changes in the wing lift. TM X-72638. Noise Characteristics of the 0-1 Airplane and Some Approaches to Noise Reduction. Andrew B. Connor, David A. Hilton, W. Latham Copeland, and Lorenzo R. Clark, Langley Research Center. NASA., at the request of the DOD, has under- taken a brief study of the 0-1A airplane to determine possible means for reducing the air- craft aural detection distance. This effort involved measuring the noise signature of the basic airplane, devising methods to attenuate the noise, and then estimating the effect of several selected modifications on the aural detection distance of the aircraft. A relatively simple modification utilizing a 6.5 ft diameter, six-blade propeller and including a muffler having a volume of 0.725 ft is indicated to reduce the aural detection distance of the 0-1 aircraft from about 6 miles at an altitude of 1,000 ft and 2 to 3 miles at an altitude of 300 ft to approximately half these values. Tie flyover noise data suggest that routing the exliaust stacks up ana over the wing would provide immediate noise reduction of about 5 dB with an attendant reduction in detection distance. Furthermore, all these studies con-</page><page sequence="23">1334 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL firm the work of other investigators tliat the 1/3 octave band (center frequency=125 cps) is the most critical in reducing aural detection distance . A further result of these studies is that the aural detection distance of the unmodified aircraft might be reduced significantly by artificially raising the lov; frequency ambient noise levels by some means such as the operation of an additional and diversionary airplane . TU X» 72 G 33. Noise Reduction Studies for the OV-l Aircraft . D. A. Hilton, A. B. Connor, V/. L. Cope land, and A. C. Dibble, Jr. Langley Research Center. A study has been conducted to define possible modifications to the OV-1 aircraft to reduce its aural detection distance. This effort involved documenting the noise characteristics of the airplane, devising modifications to reduce the noise, estimating the reduction in detection distance, and evaluating aircraft performance as a result of these modifications. It was found that the main noise source on this aircraft is the propeller and hence modifications only to the propeller and the propeller drive system are proposed. Modifications involving only the propeller are noted to involve no increase in weight but they result in only a modest decrease in aural detection distance. In order to obtain substantial decrease in aural detection distance, modifications involving changes both to the propeller and the engine -propeller gearing are required. Ill X-72640. Noise Reduction Studies for the U-1Q Airplane. David A. Hilton, Andrew B. Connor, Harvey H. Hubbard, and Richard C. Dingeldein. Langley Research Center. A study was undertaken by the NASA Langley Research Center to determine the noise reduction potential of the U-10 airplane in order to reduce its aural detection distance. Static and flyover noise measurements were made to document the basic airplane noise signature. TWo modifications to the airplane config- uration are suggested as having the best potential for substantially reducing aural detection distance with small penalty to airplane performance or stability ¿and control. These modifications include changing the present 3 -blade propeller to a 5 -blade propeller, changing the propeller diameter, and changing the propeller gear ratio, along with the use of an engine exhaust muffler. The aural detection distance corresponding to normal cruising flight at an altitude of 1,000 ft over grassy terrain is reduced from 28,000 ft (5.3 miles) to about 50% of that value for modification I and to about 25% for modification II. For the aircraft operating at an altitude of 300 ft., the analysis indicates that relatively straightforward modifications could reduce the aural detection distance to approximately 0.9 mile. Operation of the aircraft at greatly reduced engine speed (1650 rpm) with a 1.3 ft muffler designed by the manufacturer provides aural detection distances slightly lower than modification I. Til X-72641. Noise Reduction Studies for the Cessna Model 337 (0.2) Airplane. David A. Hilton, Andrew B. Connor, and Richard C. Dingeldein. Langley Research Center. A study was undertaken by the NASA Langley Research Center to determine the noise reduction potential of the 0-2 airplane in order to reduce its aural detection distance. Static and flyover noise measurements were made to document the noise signature of the unmodified airplane. The results show that significant reductions in aural detection distance can be achieved by the combination of propeller geometry clianges and the addition of engine exhaust mufflers. The best results were estimated for the aircraft equipped with a six-blade propeller operating at 3/4 engine speed in combination with a 3.49 ft exhaust muffler installed on each engine. Detection distance for the modified aircraft is estimated to be reduced from about 4 1/4 miles to ¿*bout 11/2 miles when the aircraft is operating at an altitude of 1,000 ft over grassy terrain. Reducing the ¿altitude to 300 ft over a leafy jungle ground cover should reduce the aural detection distance to 0.9 miles. Reduced aural detection distances were also indicated for a modification utilizing a direct-drive six-blade propeller of reduced radius along with smaller exhaust mufflers. Tne correpsonding aural detection distances are reduced to about 1 3/4 miles and 1 mile, respectively (1,000 ft altitude over grass and 300 ft altitude over leafy jungle ground cover. ) TM X-72642 .

This paper documents the field noise measurements, obtained at the request of the U.S. Air Force, of the Cessna 02-T turbine power- ed propeller airplane. Tne main objective of the study was to obtain the basic noise characteristics of this aircraft during static ground runs and flyover tests, to identify the sources of noise, and to correlate them with the airplane operating conditions. The results are presented in the form of overall noise levels, radiation patterns , ^ and frequency spectra.

Tří X-72643. A Noise Study of the A- G Airplane and Techniques for Reducing its Aural Detection Distance. David A. Hilton, Andrew B. Connor, and Harvey H. Hubbard. Langley Research Center. A study was undertaken by the NASA Langley Research Center to determine the noise reduction potential of the A.- 6 airplane in order to reduce its aural detection distance. Static and flyby noise measurements were taken to document the basic airplane signature. The low- frequency noise which is generally most critical for aural detection was found to be broad -band in nature from this airplane , and its source is the turbojet engine exhaust. High- frequency compressor noise, which is charact eristic of turbojet powerplants , and which is prominent at close range for this airplane, has no measurable effect on aural detection distance. The use of fluted-engine exhaust nozzles to change the far-field noise spectra is suggested as a possible means for reducing the aural detection distances. Detection distances associated witii eight-lobe and four- lobe nozzles are estimated for a 1,000 ft altitude and grassy terrain to decrease from 4 miles to about 3 miles, and from 3 miles to about 2 miles for a 300 ft altitude and grassy terrain. The above modifications are estimated to add 199 and 155 lb respectively, to the aircraft weight, and result in a 10- and 15-knot decrease in Vjnax (roughly 2%). Rate of climb and velocity for rate of climb are affected by about the same proportion as but the cruise performance and stability charact eris it cs are relatively unaffected by 'these changes.

A Design Summary of Stall Character- istics of Straight Wing Aircraft. M. A. NcVeigh and F. Kisielewski . Dynasciences Corp. Presented in this report is a comprehensive review of the existing technical literature and a design summary of stall characteristics applicable to light straight wing aircraft. These characteristics are obtained with the aid of a digital computer program which utilizes the most up-to-date analytical methods employing lifting line theory and the available experimental test data for wing section characteristics. Tne computer results are presented in the form of stall charts suitable for preliminary design purposes. Based on the extensive parametric study covering a total of 331 different aircraft configurations, it can be concluded that in modern airplane design satisfactory stalling characteristics can be readily built in with no appreciable loss in airplane performance or nandling qualities. A proper combination of wing taper, twist and type of airfoil sections with minor post-design fixes, if required, can in most cases provide satisfactory wing stall characteristics . CR 1718.

Full-scale wind-tunnel data for a low-wing single-engine light airplane, with up and down flap deflections and a range of negative through positive propeller thrust, are presented. Tne data are analyzed to determine the effects of flap deflection, propeller thrust and angle-of- attack on tne aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane.

Princeton University . This report presents the results of an experimental investigation into tire influence of atmospheric turbulence on longitudinal flying qualities. Inflight evaluations of various combinations of simulated turbulence distributions and open loop airplane dynamics were made for tire ILS approach task. Test configurations were chosen to permit an in- dependent study of the effects of turbulence to be made for a set of satisfactory longitudinal dynamics. Further testing was performed for a selective combination of turbulence and dynamics characteristics to assess their interacting influences on flying qualities for the ILS task. Tne turbulence disturbances were defined in terms of rms magnitudes of the piteli and heave components, the bandwidth or frequency contest of tne turbulence power spectrum, and the correlation between piteli and heave disturbances. Variations of long- itudinal dynamics were made in the short period natural frequency (or angle of attack stability)* short period damping, and lift curve slope. Data in the form of pilot opinion ratings and commentary , and time histories of airplane response, control inputs, and simulated turbulence disturbances were obtained. Tne time histories were digitally processed for rms measures of the precision of task performance and the pilot's control workload. CR 1975. Riding and Handling Qualities of Light Aircraft - A Review and Analysis. Frederick 0. Smetana, Delbert C. Summey, and VA Donald Johnson. North Carolina State University. Design procedures and supporting data necessary for configuring light aircraft to obtain desired responses to pilot commands and gusts are presented. The procedures employ specializations of modern military and jet transport practice where these provide an improvement over earlier practice. General criteria for riding and handling qualities are discussed in terms of the airframe dynamics. Methods available in the literature for calculating the coefficients required for a linearized analysis of the airframe dynamics are reviewed in detail. The review also treats the relation of spin and stall to airframe geometry. Root locus analysis is used to indicate the sensitivity of airframe dynamics to variations in individual stability derivatives and to variations in geometric parameters. Computer programs are given for finding the frequencies damping ratios, and time constants of all rigid body modes ana for generating time histories of aircraft motions in response to control inputs. Appendices are included presenting the derivation of the linearized equations of motion; the stability derivatives; the transfer functions; approximate solutions for tne frequency, damping ratio, and time constants; an indication of methods to be used when linear analysis is inadequate; sample calculations; and an explanation of the use of root locus diagrams and Bode plots. CR 2 GIG. Flight Testing Techniques for the Evaluation of Light Aircraft Stability Derivatives - A Review and Analysis. Frederick 0. Smetana, Delbert C. Summey, and W. Donald Johnson. North Carolina State University. Tne application of a modified Nevrton-Raphson technique to the problem of obtaining both lateral and longitudinal stability derivatives of a typical light airplane from flight test data is presented. For rapid convergence to reliable values, it is important to use initial estimates of tùie derivatives which will closely approximate those possessed by the aircraft. Computer programs wiiich will give acceptable initial estimates for both the longitudinal and lateral stability derivatives of a light aircraft are listed in the Appendix. Application of the Nevrton-Raphson tecimique was found to give good results when the initial estimates of the lateral stability derivative values were witiiin 25% of their actual value; however, even more accurate estimates are necessary to obtain good results fron the longitudinal mode. Tne program described makes it possible to favor the extraction procedure those measure- ments or maneuvers deemed to be more reliable. However , information from other sources-instru- ment calibrations, previous experience, etc. must be used to take advantage of this flexibility. For these studies all quantities were taken to be equally important. CR 2046. Investigation of tùie Applicability of the Free-Winp Principle to Light,</page><page sequence="26">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1337 General Aviation Aircraft. Richard F. Porter, Ross G. Luce, and Joe H. Brown, Jr. Battelle Memorial Inst. A. previous study indicated substantial gust-alleviation benefits for aircraft employing an unconventional wing, free to pivot about a spanwise axis forward of its aerodynamic center and subject only to aerodynamic pitching moments imposed by lift and drag forces and a trailing edge control surface. Although the primary benefit was found to be in the attenuation of normal load factor disturbances through symmetrical passive motion of the wing panels, rolling distrubances were also reduced by permitting differential freedom of the left and right wing sections. The investigation reported in this document is an extension of the previous study, with emphasis on the practical application of the free-wing concept to light, general aviation aircraft. Analytical work , supported by limited wind-tunnel experiments , was performed to evaluate the impact of selected design and certification constraints appropriate to the type of aircraft being considered.

Carden. North Carolina State University. This report describes a servo system devised to meet the requirements for an electrical actuator capable of moving a full-span, Fowler type wing flap very rapidly and very precisely over large excursions under all flight conditions which a typical light aircraft might encounter. A notable feature of the design is the use of an electrical motor with a power rating only twice the maximum power required. There is, in addition, a provision which removes electrical excitation from the motor when the flap position is stationary for periods in excess of Us , as well as a provision which serves to cover the effects of static friction and motor non-linearities at low excitation voltages.

A major outcome of the studies sponsored by the Advanced Concept and Mission Division, A.C.M.D. of NASA under Contract No. NAS2-5885 dated January 30, 1970 as reported in CR 114289 and under Contract Nò. NAS2-6477 dated May 6, 1971 as reported in CR 114399 has been the development of a computer program for evaluating propeller performance (static, flight, reverse), noise, weight, and cost for general aviation aircraft propellers as a function of the prime geometric and aerodynamic variables. Propellers have been divided into five classifications which distinguish the complexity of general aviation propellers, that is, fixed versus variable piteli, de icing capability, full feathering capability, and reverse thrust capability. Parameters that may be varied independently include number of blades, blade activity factor, blade integrated design lift coefficient* and blade tipspeed. A User's Manual for the computer program was written under Contract No. NAS2-6477 and is presented herein. A brief description of tùie technology development is presented, and a complete listing of the computer program as well as detailed instructions and samples of input and output are included. Examples of parametric studies which can be made with the computer program are shown. Hie performance of the design has been evaluated by considering the components as ideal, lumped-parameter elements, amenable to linear analysis. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of friction behavior, etc., a more elaborate analysis did not appear to be justified. CR 2121. A Simulator Evaluation of the Use of Spoilers on a Light Aircraft. Carl K. Brainerd and David L. Kohlman. University of Kansas. Tne fixed-base flight simulator at the University of Kansas Flight Research Laboratory was used to evaluate wing spoilers for longitudinal flight path control on a modified Cessna Cardinal aircraft. Spoilers which generated the proper pitching moment to maintain aircraft trim C^ constant could be used as an effective descent rate control. Spoilers which did not maintain constant aircraft trim C^ excited the aircraft phugoid mode to a greater degree, so that handling qualities were less satisfactory. More than 100 simulated ILS approaches were flown by evaluation pilots using both conventional methods and spoiler descent rate control. Three spoiler control schemes were evaluated during the ILS approaches . CR 2204. An Analytical Study of the Response of a Constant-Attitude Aircraft to Atmospheric Turbulence. Frederick 0.

Such a control system seems capable of very beneficial application to low wing loading ST0L machines for_gust alleviation. The vertical gust alleviation is limited by the aero- dynamic capability of the flaps to modulate the</page><page sequence="27">1338 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A.

A Design Study for a Simple-to-Fly , Constant Attitude Light Aircraft. Frederick 0. Smetana, Douglas E. Humphreys, Rafael J. Montoya , William W. Rickard, and Ivan E. Wilkinson. North Carolina State University. This report summarizes the results of a multiple year program sponsored by the NASA and conducted by North Carolina State University to investigate the feasibility of different control concepts being applied to general aviation airplanes. Emphasis was placed on the design and analysis of a simple-to-f ly , constant -attitude light aircraft. Tne concept employs fast -acting, full-span, Fowler- type wing flaps - operated together for lift modulation at all flight conditions and differentially for full control - a completely separate fuselage leveler driving the elevator, and a turn coordinator controlling the rudder and differential flap motions. A flap-power interconnect is also provided to permit ascent at constant f o ward speed and airspeed changes at constant rate -of -climb. The pilot has only two controls: a wheel and a throttle. Changes in a throttle position change speed only. Sustained rotation of the wheel produces a coordinated turn. Forward motion of the wheel causes descent at constant forward speed and rearward positioning of the wheel results in a rate-of -climb at constant forward speed. CR 2272. Point and Path Performance of Light Aircraft - A Review and Analysis. Frederick 0. Smetana, Delbert C. Summey, and W. Donald Johnson. North Carolina State University. Tne literature on methods for predicting the performance of light aircraft is reviewed. The methods discussed in the review extend from the classical instantaneous maximum or minimum technique to techniques for generating mathmetically optimum flight paths. Classical point performance techniques are shown to be adequate in many cases but their accuracies are compromised by the need to use simple lift, drag, and thrust relations in order to get closed form solutions. Also the investigation of the effect of changes in weight, altitude, configuration, etc. , involves many essentially repetitive calculations. Accordingly, computer programs are provided which can fit arbitrary drag polars and power curves with very high precision and which can then use the resulting fits to compute the performance under the assumption that the aircraft is not accelerating. Path performance programs are also provided which permit the user to specify the variations with time of any two of six quantities (V,h,P,^ ,W, f) and to receive as output the correct variations with time of the other four quantities. This program is desirable when optimum performance is not obtained under steady state conditions but rather during what may be termed maneuvers. Detailed program listings and instructions for use are provided as are several worked out example problems. Programs to compute mathematically optimal flight paths are not provided because those cases where solutions have been obtained lack generality and because considerable mathematical sophistication is required to determine which problems can be treated by existing techniques. Also the path performance program can be run repeatedly to identify quasi-optimal paths. CR 2315. lío tor les s Flight Research , 1972. Dr. James L.

The most important feature of the flare has turned out to be the airplane's deceleration in the flare, and it has been found to be possible to correlate various effects on this in terms of the average flare load factor.

The historical development of analytical methods for predicting the lift, drag, and pitching moment of complete light aircraft configurations in cruising flight is reviewed. Theoretical methods, based in part on techniques described in the literature and in part on original work, are then developed in detail. These methods form the basis for understanding the computer programs presented in the remainder of the work. Programs are given to: (1) compute the lift, drag, and moment of conventional airfoils, (2) extend these two-dimensional characteristics to three dimensions for moderate-to-high aspect ratio unswept wings, (3) plot complete configurations, (4) convert the fuselage geometric data to the correct input format, (5) compute the fuselage lift and drag, (6) compute the lift and moment of symmetrical airfoils to M = 1.0 by a simplified semi-empirical procedure, and (7) , compute, in closed form, the pressure distri- bution over a prolate spheroid at =0. Comparisons of the predictions with experiment indicate excellent lift and drag agreement for conventional airfoils and wings for Cl = 0.8. Limited comparisons of body-alone drag characteristics yield reasonable agreement. Also included are discussions for interference effects and techniques for summing the results of 1-5 above to obtain predictions for complete configurations . CR 73258.

Pliase II concentrated on establishing detailed structural design, cost, and fabrication analyses for those materials and concepts that show the most promise of reducing labor hours and facilitating mass production as applied to the "far term" light airplane conceptual design.

This report summarizes a seven-month program of work involving selection and design of a Time/ Frequency Collision Avoidance System for use in general aviation aircraft. Minor modifications to the ATA Collision Avoidance Specifications are required in order to reduce the design complexity and cost of the GA CAS equipment . The present simplified GA, CAS design utilized a 1.5 ms time slot structure (with accurately synchronized range transmissions) and altitude telemetry which conforms to the ATA CAS characteristics. Slight modifications to the ATA CAS frequency-switching logic are proposed to permit assignment of approximately 1000 of the 2000 available ATA CAS slots for use by low-flying aircraft. Simplification of the GA version of Time/Frequency CAS involves deletion of requirements for phase-coherent long-pulse transmissions, doppler processing, and multi- frequency reception. Use of synchronous reference pulse transmissions by ground VORTAC stations also permits reduction of transmitter power and receiver sensitivity requirements and deletion of the back-up mode. The transmission of auxiliary data (as biphase modulation of the transmitted pulse) is also eliminated. Deletion of doppler range rate extraction involves soné increase in the protection envelope about own aircraft. However, use of a shorter pulse to distinguish GA CAS</page><page sequence="29">1 340 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A.

Detailed system design and associated costing information is provided, which indicates that if there is sufficient user interest, the system target cost to the user will fall below $15 00 within a reasonable time after introduction of the simplified GA CAS equipment on the market.

Alsworth, Et Al. AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona. The report presents the results of a study concerning the applicability of small turbofan engines to general aviation airplanes. Because of its high overall propulsion-system efficiency, the turbofan engine is now being chosen for most military and commercial airplanes. It is therefore desirable to evaluate the further applicability of turbofan engines to smaller general aviation airplanes. This initial study by NASA Ames and AiResearch establishes interrelationships and evaluates the effects of specific engine noise constraints. Tne methods whereby these interrelationships and effects were determined and the results of synthesis and sensitivity analyses are described. In addition to engine price, engine performance quality was found to be a very important determinant of airplane size, the resultant price, and operating cost. CR 114665. Q-Fans® for General Aviation Aircraft. Rose Worobel and Millard G. Mayo. Hamilton Standards; and ilark Waters, NASA.. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the prop-fan as a low noise propulsor for advanced general aviation aircraft. Because of its low noise signature, Hamilton Standard has adopted the name '''Q-Fan®'1 for this promising new propulsor concept. Analytical criteria for predicting the performance, noise, weight , and cost of Q-Fans projected to the 1980 time period were established . Furthermore , noise , weight , and cost criteria were established for piston, rotary combustion, and gas turbine ensines and gearboxes. These criteria were programmed in FORTRAN IV and included in a NASA aircraft f synthesis program for computing the aerodynamics, structural weights and cost of general aviation aircraft. Furthermore , the Q-Fan generalizations were combined in a smaller computer program to permit the assessment of Q-Fan characteristics separately. With these computer programs established , parametric studies were conducted in Q-Fan propulsion packages for several representative aircraft size categories. It is generally shown that for the 1980 time period, the propulsion package consisting of a Q-Fan combined with a rotary combustion engine results in a quiet, compact airplane system, with essentially the same performance weight arid cost of present day propulsion systems. Detailed conceptual propulsion system integration studies were made to deal with the problems of integrating the Q-Fan and engine and of installing the Q-Fan/engine propulsion package onto both s ingle- and twin-engine aircraft. The company rotary combustion engine and the gas turbine engine appear to be more compatible with Q-Fans in terms of interference problems and engine weight than the piston engine. Furthermore, the Q-Fan offers the aircraft designer a new degree of flexibility in con- figuring light aircraft. Finally, a major contribution of this study is the new Q-Fan methodology which was derived to predict Q-Fan performance, noise, wieght and cost. This methodology was utilized in the parametric studies, and it is intended that the reader of this report will have sufficient data to permit similar Q-Fan studies for any general aviation aircraft. A, complete listing of the Q-Fan computer program with detailed instructions on its use are included. All the curves and equations for the analytical methods included in the computer program and presented with instruction of usage in lieu of the computer. CR 132333. Investigation of Acoustic Properties of a Rigid Foam with Application to Noise Reduction in Light Aircraft . Curtis I. Holmer. Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. NASA plans to incorporate a rigid, closed-cell foam into the walls of light aircraft cabins to increase their fire resistance. Tie research program described in this report was undertaken to evaluate the acoustic properties of a rigid, clossed-cell foam for use in improving the acoustic environment of light</page><page sequence="30">NASA GENERAL AVIATION RESEARCH OVERVIEW 1 34 1 aircraft. Tne program consisted of - three major phases including: 1. Development of a suitable analytic model of sound transmission into an aircraft cabin. 2. Identification of test procedures which appropriately rank order properties which affect sound transmission. 3. Measurement of pertinent properties of materials or constructions which incorporate the foam. Tne proposed analytic model agrees well with available data, and reveals that the pertinent properties of an aircraft cal) in for frequencies (as this reflects on impedance of the walls) and cabin wall transmission loss and interior absorption at mid and high frequencies. It was found experimentally that below 315 IIz the foam can contribute substantially to wall stiffness and sound transmission loss of typical light aircraft cabin construction, and could potential- ly reduce cabin noise levels by 3-5dB on this frequency range at a cost of about 2 lb/ft of treated cabin area. Data on current aircraft reveal that present sound levels in this frequency range produce hearing damage risk with long-term exposure. The foam was not to have significant sound absorbing properties, but this is not believed to detract significantly from total cabin absorption. CR 132568. Wind Tunnel Tests of a Symmetrical Airfoil with Scoop-Fed Slots. Charles A. Beisterling. Franklin Inst. Research Laboratories . Tie design and wind tunnel test of a model vertical tail fin is described in this report. The model is designed to provide the aero- dynamic forces necessary for lateral stabiliza- tion without moving parts or a separate source of power. It employs scoop-fed slots on both surfaces of the symmetrical airfoil. They are to be controlled differentially by means of a fluidic amplifier to implement an automatic full-time lateral stabilization system. The results of tests show that the control of forces is stable and quite linear in various modes of operation. Significant forces were produced that can be increased as necessary by increasing slot size and scoop size. Slots can be located ahead of the conventional rudder and the scoop can be at the base of the vertical tail fin to avoid the need for major changes in conventional aircraft design. CR 137628.

Obermayer and William T. Roe. Manned Systems Sciences, Inc. The purpose of this study was to perform a current assessment of the frequency and severity of carburetor/ induct ion icing in general-aviation accidents. Tre available literature and accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board were collected. A computer analysis of the accident data was performed. Between 65 and 90 accidents each year involve carburetor/ induction system icing as a probable cause/ factor. Under conditions conducive to carburetor/ induction icing, between 50 and 70% of engine malfunction/ failure accidents (exclusive of those due to fuel exhaustion) are due to carburetor/ induction system icing. Since the evidence of such icing may not remain long after an accident, it is probable that the frequency of occurrence of such accidents is underestimated; therefore, some extrapolation of the data was conducted in this study. CR - IH PUBLICATION Effectiveness of Spoilers on the GA(W)-1 with a High Performance Fowler Flap. W. H. Wentz, Jr. Wichita State University. Two-dimensional wind-tunnel tests have been conducted at a Reynold's number of 2 x 10 ^ to determine effectiveness of spoilers applied to the GA(W)-1 airfoil. Tnese of several spoiler configurations show adequate control effective- ness with flap nested. With 40 deg ^ flap , many spoiler configurations result in ^ negative control response for small deflections, followed</page><page sequence="31">1 342 R. L. WINBLADE AND J. A. WESTFALL by highly non-linear control response at higher deflections, including substantial aerodynamic hysteresis for several configurations. It was found that providing a vent path allowing lower surface air to escape to the upper surface as the spoiler opens alleviates control reversal and hysteresis tendencies. Spoiler cross sectional shape variations generally had modest influence on control characteristics. A series of comparative tests of vortex generators applied to the GA(W)-1 airfoil show that triangular planform vortex generators of the same span. CR - IN PUBLICATION Noise Characteristics of Several General Aviation Aircraft. Carole S. Tanner. Hydrospace-Challenger , Inc. The NASA, in cooperation with the FAA, obtained noise measurements on general aviation aircraft during FM- sponsored tests at the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC) during the month of July 1972. Noise measurements were obtained for takeoff-climbout and flyby operations of the aircraft under controlled operating conditions for nine general aviation airplanes. The report presents the results from eight ground noise measurement stations for the various flights, along with pertinent airplane operating conditons, tracking information, and surface weather data, lhe noise data are presented in units which reflect both physical and subjective measures and are representative of those anticipated for operation of these types of aircraft. CR - IN PUBLICATION Noise Characteristics of Several Executive Jet Aircraft. Ray E. Glass. Hydrospace-Challenger, Inc. This report examines five business jet aircraft and one twin engine jet transport as the first of a series of noise tests. This series was conducted during a one-week period of June 1972 at the FM's National Aviation Flight Evaluation Center (NAFEC) in New Jersey. Test data includes: noise recordings, meteorological measurements, aircraft tracking, aircraft performance, and aircraft operations. The data were analyzed to provide an acoustic data base in the form of tabulated acoustic measurements, EPNL versus slant range, and SENEL versus slant range curves as inputs to present prediction models. Included are tabulated meterological and aircraft performance data for the test. In addition, the data were examined to determine the measurement variability that may be expected using the noise certification procedures of the FAR Part 36.</page></plain_text>
