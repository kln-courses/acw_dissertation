<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry C. Wheeler's Native American Artifact Collection at the Thoreau Farm Shirley Blancke Associate Curator for Archaeology, The Concord Museum Introduction This is a kind of detective story about the highly unlikely discovery of lost information that seemed an impossible dream at the start. I undertook it because of its connection, however distant, to Henry David Thoreau and for those who care to know anything new that might have any bearing on his life or work. In 2002, the Concord Museum accepted a donation of the H.C. Wheeler collection of Native American artifacts from the Museum of Primitive Art and Culture (MPAC) in Peace Dale, Rhode Island. It was known from labels in the boxes that the artifacts had been surface collected from sites near the Concord River in Concord, Massachusetts, but the particular sites were unidentifiedâ€” or so it appeared. Although some details of how the collection came to MPAC had been recorded, the full name and background of the collector were unknown. Similarly, the full name of the man who MPAC thought had sold the collection to the museum in 1917, H.E. Wheeler, was also unknown. He signed himself "H.E. Wheeler" on a letter whose letterhead identified him as a Methodist pastor from Conway, Arkansas. MPAC decided to deaccession the collection for lack of information but offered it to the Concord Museum in the hope that eventually more could be found out by an institution situated in the town where the collection had apparently originated. The collection comprised 725 stone artifacts including axes, gouges, spear thrower weights, projectile points, pestles, drills, whetstones, hammerstones, plummets, scrapers, blades, pre-forms (unfinished artifacts), and chipping waste. In the spring of 2010, as archaeology curator at the Concord Museum, I looked at the collection in the course of an on-going computer-cataloging project of the museum's Native American artifacts. A first impression was that the lack of site information did not bode well for the collection's usefulness for research, since it looked like there was only generalized Concord provenance for the The Concord Saunterer: A. Journal of Thoreau Studies, N.S. Vol. 19/20, 2011-12</page><page sequence="2">54 The Concord Saunterer: A. journal of Thoreau Studies material. As I looked inside the boxes, I noticed several had notes saying, as expected, that the artifacts came from village sites along the Concord River, but one box was different. That box of about 90 artifacts contained a note in what appeared to be nineteenth-century handwriting that read, "92 unfinished blades, various stages of workmanship, from large village site, Concord River, near Thoreau's Farm, Concord, Mass. Collected by H.C. Wheeler" (emphasis mine). The Thoreau Farm referred to seemed to be the birthplace of Henry David in Concord, now known as the Birthplace site after the original house was moved further east down Virginia Road. I found that no archaeological site was recorded in the Massachusetts Historical Commission's site files from the Thoreau Birthplace, but there was a site on Pine Hill, a half mile to the east beyond Elm Brook. In the other direction, a mile away from the farm, on the south side of the Great Meadows Wildlife Refuge that is adjacent to the Concord River, were two more sites. Were any of these close enough to be "near Thoreau's Farm," or was the material in fact found on the Thoreau Farm itself, perhaps near the farmhouse? If the provenance of the collection could be established, I knew that many people, not least the Thoreau Society, would be interested in this new perspective on the Thoreau Farm. The first task was to try to identify the collector, H.C. Wheeler, and H.E. Wheeler, who was thought to have sold the collection. Over the summer and into the fall of 2010, with the help of many people knowledgeable about Concord history, archives, and genealogy, it became possible to establish that the collection was made by Henry C. Wheeler, who lived at the Thoreau Farm in Concord from 1883-1915, until he sold it to Ruth and Caleb Wheeler's family. Ruth Wheeler was the author of the well-known history of Concord, Climate For Freedom. Documentary evidence was found that established that Henry C. collected on his farm, and museum data showed that he collected not only in Concord but in other towns, too. He was one of several Concord men who followed a hobby started by Henry David Thoreau, as far as is known. Henry C.'s collection was eventually divided, the larger part of which went to the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, Massachusetts, which, like MPAC, had no information about the collector. R.S. Peabody did know that Wheeler collected from sites along the Concord River in Concord within 5 or 6 miles of his house and that the collection included material from other towns. A half-dozen artifacts from the H.C. Wheeler collection are at the Middlesex School in</page><page sequence="3">Shirley Blancke 55 Concord, given probably when their now-disbanded Thoreau Museum was started. What follows are descriptions of the museum history of MPAC's part of the Henry C. Wheeler collection before its coming to the Concord Museum, the Concord Museum's research on the genealogy ot the relevant Wheelers, the archaeological profile of the Thoreau Farm artifacts in the Concord Museum/MPAC collection, a description of the land comprised by the original Thoreau Birthplace with a view to finding an archaeological site, and a profile of the R.S. Peabody's part of the collection, as well as a description of the few artifacts at Middlesex School. Museum Background to the Collection Sarah Turnbaugh, director of MP AC in 2002, provided as much information to the Concord Museum as MPAC had. Her report included when and how it was thought the collection came to the museum and information on its cataloging at MP AC, as well as copies of pages from the early catalog that contained little information about provenance other than that the artifacts came from the town of Concord, Massachusetts. The only data MPAC had about the collection's accession that was thought to be relevant was a letter from an H.E. Wheeler, whose letterhead identified him as a Methodist pastor in Conway, Arkansas. It indicated that he offered a small collection of artifacts from Arkansas for a few dollars to the founder of MPAC, Rowland G. Hazard II, on or about Sept. 12, 1917 (the date of the letter). The letter also mentioned that H.E. Wheeler had recently traveled in the Northeast to look at important archaeological and mineral collections and visited Andover, New Haven, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. No mention was made of Concord, Massachusetts, or the H.C. Wheeler collection. Turnbaugh researched extensive Hazard archives at the local historical society but tound no further letters. She noted that the signature on the letter did not match the handwriting on paper slips found in boxes containing the artifacts and concluded that the slips were written by Mr AC s cataloger, Ronald L. Olson from the American Museum of Natural History, or his wife. She also opined that a mistake was made in transcribing the initials of the collector who was likely H.E. Wheeler, since nothing was known of an H.C. Wheeler. But did the letter in fact relate to the collection?</page><page sequence="4">56 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies Wheeler Genealogical Research and Proof of the Collector s Identity I wondered not only whether H.C. Wheeler and H.E. Wheeler were the same man, but if either were a woman. While nineteenth-century collectors are thought to have been predominantly male, a biographer of the late nineteenth-/early twentieth-century Concord collector, Adams Tolman, stated that Tolman's wife was an equally keen collector of arrowheads and regularly accompanied him to collect in the fields (French 176). Current members of the Wheeler family in Concord pointed the way to conducting genealogical research on the family. The Wheelers are a very large family of many branches within several genealogical lines that can be traced back to the seventeenth century. Richard W. Wheeler told me there was an extensive Wheeler genealogy on the Concord Free Public Library's website that had been updated by Joseph C. Wheeler, former Chair of the Concord Historical Commission. Multiple usages of the name "Henry," and its diminutive "Harry," made knowledge of at least a middle initial crucial and added to the complexity of the identifications. Rick Wheeler indicated there were no "H's" in his part of the family but kindly wrote to the Wheeler family in Rhode Island, who similarly had no information. Subsequently, Joe Wheeler was able to point to the possible identity of H.C. Wheeler as the Henry C. Wheeler who in 1915 sold the Thoreau Farm to Ruth Wheeler's father, who gave the property to loe's parents, Ruth and Caleb, upon their marriage in 1916. He indicated that these two Wheeler families belonged to different genealogical lines. I later learned that at least five families from three lines, the George and Obadiah and Sergeant Thomas Wheeler lines, were living in Concord during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Only Henry C.'s family belonged to the Obadiah line, while most of the other Wheelers mentioned in this text are descended from George Wheeler. Joe grew up on the Thoreau Farm and owns a projectile point he and a brother think their father found on the farm. Since he knew of no other artifacts, Joe doubted if Henry C. Wheeler could possibly have found a site with 90 artifacts on his property.</page><page sequence="5">Shirley Blancke 57 Figure 1. Genealogical charts for Henry C. Wheeler and Marry E. Wheeler.

Journal of Thoreau Studies Joe Wheeler had added a note about Henry C. to the Wheeler genealogy on the Concord Free Public Library website but had no information on his possible children. The next goal, then, was to trace the identity of H.E. Wheeler of Conway, Arkansas who, according to MPAC's records, seemed to have sold them the collection in 1917 and who might have been H.C. Wheeler's son or other relative. Judith Fichtenbaum of the Concord Museum took on the challenge of consulting U.S. and State Censuses and town vital statistics to find the genealogical links we needed that were not in the Concord Library's Wheeler genealogy. Figure 1 is derived from the wealth of information she provided about H.C. and H.E. Wheeler, their families and ancestors. Genealogical research established the presumed seller of the collection, H.E. Wheeler, as the Rev. Harry E. Wheeler of Conway, Arkansasâ€”a very distant cousin of Henry C. Wheeler. H.C. and H.E. Wheeler belonged to different Wheeler lines, but both families lived in Concord in the nineteenth century. We have not been able to find a documented connection between them, but the genealogical research suseests that Henrv C. and Harry E.'s father. Henry Lincoln, who was sixteen years older than Henry C., would have known each other in Concord. Henry C., whose family origins were in Acton and Carlisle, came to Concord in the 1870s after marrying in 1871 and lived with his wife's family, the Tibbetts, on the Thoreau Farm, acquiring ownership in 1883. Harry E.'s father, Henry Lincoln, was born in Concord and is recorded as living there in 1865, but fifteen years later he is found in Birmingham, Alabama, with a six year-old son, Harry E. Wheeler. Henry Lincoln survived only six more years, dying in 1886. Harry E. was the same age as Henry C.'s daughter, Laura, both being born in 1874, but no evidence was found of Henry C. having a son. Henry C.'s death was recorded in Lexington in 1925 by a Laura H. Litchfield, presumably his married daughter,1 and he is buried in Concord's Sleepy Hollow Cemetery with his wife who died in 1899 (Figure 2). A third individual in the grave, noted in the cemetery records but not on the headstone, is Harry W. Wheeler, a distant cousin who died in 1909.2 Additional historical details about these families are noted in Figure 1.</page><page sequence="7">Shirley Blancke 59 Figure 2. Henry C. and Sarah J. Wheeler headstone. Pine Ridge Avenue, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Massachusetts. Did Henry C., knowing of Harry E.'s interest in archaeology and mineralogy (indicated by the MPAC letter of 1917), ask him to inquire with museums whether they would be interested in that part of his collection still in his possession at the time he sold the Thoreau Farm in 1915? And did Harry E. thereafter facilitate the sale or gift? Or, did Henry C. sell the collection to MPAC in 1912 when he sold the larger part to the R.S. Peabody museum? If either, MPAC has no record. While the genealogical research provided circumstantial evidence that Henry C. Wheeler was the likely collector, this identification was further proved by documentary references provided by Thoreau scholar Thomas Blanding. Three quotations from Franklin Sanborn's weekly articles in The Springfield Republican mention Henry Wheeler s collection and collecting. Sanborn lived in Concord and was the same Franklin Benjamin Sanborn who was a friend of the abolitionist John Brown and who financed Brown as one of the group of supporters known as the "Secret Six." From Aug. 15, 1901, is the following: There is a collection of Indian arrowheads and utensils at the Minot homestead on the Virginia road, where Thoreau was born, exceeding in amount anything that Thoreau ever collected. Mr. Wheeler, the collector,</page><page sequence="8">60 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies finds arrowheads on his 80-acre farm as easily as Thoreau ever found them at "Clamshell" on the river bank. (Sanborn 127)3 A later quote from April 4, 1912, clarifies the identity of the collector and the farm property: There is a living person, on the farm of Capt. Jonas Minott [sic], where Thoreau was born in 1817, Henry Wheeler by name...who [has made] a collection of those substantial matters which Thoreau wrote about [In place of the old Thoreau house], long since removed further up the road toward Lexington...stands a newer farmhouse, in which the united households of Tibbitts [sic] and Wheeler have met and set up their household goods. (268) Henry C. Wheeler was married to Sarah Tibbetts. A quote from February 21, 1907, expands the description of Henry Wheeler's artifact collection and connects him with the Middlesex School. Sanborn opines: II.K. [sic] Wheeler of Concord has been for 10 years or so diligently collecting in Thoreau's earlier field of research some thousand or two specimens of Indian implements and relics, along with other curios of the white man's period. These are genuinely aboriginal, of his own finding, and free from that taint of modern manufacture which is sure to come when curios have a market value. I have suggested to him that the proper place for his collection is in the new Thoreau museum of the Middlesex School, by Bateman's pond in Concord. (209) In the oldest accessioned stone artifact collection at the Concord Museum (collector unknown), is a large, fine blade of black rhyolite, ten cm long, labeled "Virginia road, Concord." It is made in the Fox Creek Stemmed style that belongs to the Middle Woodland period (see Figure 10) and is either a large spear head or a knife (Figure 3). Did this come from the Thoreau Farm?</page><page sequence="9">Shirley Blancke 61 Figure 3. Fox Creek Stemmed biface from Virginia Road, Concord. Courtesy of the Concord Museum, Foss-Barrett-Brown collection. Artifacts from the Thoreau Farm Site in the H.C. Wheeler Collection at the Concord Museum Only one box of artifacts contains a label identifying the material as coming from a particular site: somewhere near the Thoreau Farm, Concord. The label specifies 92 artifacts, and an inventory made by the author shows there are vi, the additional artifact perhaps due to breakage. This close correspondence in number makes it likely that the label is in the right box. Sarah Turnbaugh of MPAC compared the writing with the signature on H.E. Wheeler's letter and, finding it dissimilar, concluded that the label was written by the cataloger, Ronald Olson. However, since H.E. Wheeler was not the collector, and the writing appears to be nineteenth-century in style, it seems likely that the label was written by Henry C. himself.4 All the artifacts in this box have the same MPAC catalog number (H366), and there are three other boxes of artifacts with the same number. At first it was hoped this number might represent one site, but it appears from Turnbaugh's analysis of the cataloging that the material tended to be cataloged by type of artifact, so that conclusion cannot be drawn. By today's standards of typology, not all the artifacts in these boxes are of the same type. The</page><page sequence="10">62 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies Thoreau Farm label characterized the artifacts in that box as finished and unfinished blades, which I have identified as projectile points and edge tools or various kinds (knives, scrapers [rigure 4J), and the other boxes have similar contents.

Artifact List for the Thoreau Farm Site When radiocarbon dating is not possible, as with this collection, archaeologists look at types of "projectile points" (dart heads, spear points, arrowheads) to provide a rough chronology and identify time periods represented at a site. 31 points, a third of the artifacts from the box containing Thoreau Farm material, cover the Middle and Late Archaic periods as well as the Early and Middle Woodland periods (ca. 6,000 BC â€” 1,000 AD). Relatively few projecuie points scattered over a long time span suggests multiple short-term camps of hunter-gatherer peoples (Figure 4, first column, Figure 5). Interestingly, there are no points from the Late Woodland</page><page sequence="11">Shirley Blancke 63 ind Contact periods, which are associated with horticulture and corn :ultivation. There is also no evidence of the earliest periods, the Paleoindian and Early Archaic. Many of the projectile points and Dther artifacts are broken, so Wheeler did not select for whole specimens as collectors often did. The shape and manufacture of aroiectile points, which are given type names, are what determine their identification and chronology, and bases without points are asually identifiable (Figures 4, 5). Apart from the projectile points, the great bulk ot the remaining artifacts (62) are edge tools, some of them large, half of which are unfinished (Figure 4, second column). They probably represent knives and a few scrapers, judging by the thickness of the cutting edges (Figures 6, 7). There are leaf-shaped knives and teardrop endscrapers as well as scrapers with graver points, but no typical perforators (Figure 7). In addition, there are five multifaceted cores from which flakes were struck to make edge tools, projectile points, and other tools. Some of the worn cores became hammerstones. There are no woodworking tools, spear thrower weights, plummets, pestles, whetstones, and there is no chipping waste. It is possible that these were collected but are now in the collection's generalized Concord material. The overall artifact profile gives the impression of being skewed when compared with material in collections at the Concord Museum from other Concord sites that have a similar number of artifacts but a greater variety of tool types. While the number of large edge tools and their apparent general uniformity suggest this site may have been a manufacturing area for them, it is not possible in fact to connect these tools with the projectile points to give them an approximate date, so it cannot be determined if they belong to one neriod or manv. Onlv a controlled excavation could do that. comparing the positions of artifacts to one other in the soil or their associations with organic material such as charcoal that could be radiocarbon dated. The lithics (stone types) used are typical of the Boston area's gray and black rhyolites of which Concord artifacts are largely made, with a tew artifacts ot quartzite, one ot argmite, and one of the usually common white quartz. One artifact may be of red felsite from Braintree and another may be of white and tan felsite from Sally Rock. The Early Woodland Meadowood point appears to be of a New York State gray chert.</page><page sequence="12">64 The Concord Saunterer: A. Journal of Thoreau Studies Figure 5.

Wheeler collection.</page><page sequence="15">Shirley Blancke 67 The Original Thoreau Farm Land One aspect of the research focused on what was known about the land at the original Thoreau Farm that surrounded what is now known as the Birthplace site and its current condition, with a view to identifying the possible location or an archaeological site, assuming the artifacts were indeed found on the farm as the Sanborn quotes would suggest. Criteria for such a site would include closeness to a good water source and well-drained land for habitation or horticulture and might include a southern exposure and protection from wind, such as the south side of a hill. The Thoreau Farm land provides many possible locations that fit some of these criteria. Additionally, an archaeological site uncovered in the nineteenth century was most likely found in a plowed field. However, the current condition of much of the former farmland, covered in dense scrub, would make an archaeological survey very difficult to conduct. On the other hand, it is not clear what "near Thoreau s Farm," found on the artifact box label, really means. The farm is about a mile from the Concord River, so it is possible that the site represented by these artifacts is not on the tarm s land and that Henry C. was collecting from two sites northwest of his property near the Great Meadows. The artifact profile in Figure 4 would fit the profile of one of the Great Meadows sites known from Concord Museum collections. Alternatively, Wheeler might have been collecting from a site on Pine Hill a half mile to the east of the Thoreau Farm. At the foot of the hill is the Wheeler-Merriam house, 477 Virginia Road, that at one time belonged to a Wheeler family of the Sgt. Thomas Wheeler line. In front of it rests a supposed Indian mortar for corn grinding that is a large boulder with a hollow "basin" on top. Hamilton Algeo, owner of the house in the early 1900s, used a team of oxen to haul it from high up on the west side of Pine Hill, fThe orio-inal nosition of the boulder is marked on a man of the collector, Benjamin L. Smith, at the Concord Museum.) It is possible, but in my view not likely, that Henry C.'s artifacts came from Pine Hill. On the plus side, the hill is adjacent to a good stream of running water, Elm Brook, but there are no other known artifacts from this location besides the "mortar," which may not in fact be a mortar. The boulder's hollow basin on top shows no signs of grinding and is likely the result of a natural spall. While the Great Meadows and Pine Hill sites are possible sources of the box of "near Thoreau's Farm" artifacts, Franklin</page><page sequence="16">68 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies Sanborn s quotes encourage a closer look at the Thoreau Farm land itself as their source. About 1878, during the Tibbetts' ownership (The Tibbetts were Henry C. Wheeler's in-laws), the Thoreau Birthplace house was moved east down Virginia Road and replaced with another house, the one acquired by Henry C. Wheeler in 1883. Joseph Wheeler, who was born in that replacement house and grew up on the 80-acre farm, wrote a paper on its history.3 In it he drew a map of what he remembered about land use on the farm (Figure 8). The farm lay to the north and south of Virginia Road, which is on the east side or Concord, ihe general area or the rarm is almost an island surrounded by swamp or streams: Mill Brook to the west and south and Elm Brook to the east and north. Mill Brook appears on maps to start in the area, but when I asked if there were any clear bubbling springs, Joe replied that there were not and that most of the land was so swampy it was not clear in which direction the water flowed or where Mill Brook started. The only clear stream is Elm Brook, further to the east along Virginia Road, which looks to have been at least partly canalized. Ditches, dug perhaps in the eighteenth century on the north side of the farm, drain water from or into a large cattail swamp on the northeast border that is marked "Algeo's swamp" on Wheeler's map. From taking two walking tours, one with J. Walter Brain, a director of the Thoreau Society, I found that currently much of the original farm land is reverting to scrub and not accessible even on foot. This is particularly the case on the west and south side where meadows and an orchard marked on the Wheeler map were subdivided for building; beyond the present houses and gardens, the land is not maintained. I his area may formerly have been plowed, and in my view it is the most likely location for a site. On the eastern side, a cursory look at a former asparagus field did not disclose evidence of chipping waste or other fragments. This field and the former Breen Farm (Figure 8) are cultivated by "Gaining Ground," a nonprofit farm that raises food for hunger relief with the help of community volunteers.6</page><page sequence="17">Shirley Blancke 69 Figure 8. Joseph C. Wheeler's map of the old Thoreau Farm (Birthplace). (In The Concord Sanntenr, N. S., Vol. 7 (1999): 29). The northern part of the farm has some intriguing characteristics and seemed to Joe to be a good location for a Native American site. There was originally a farm road from behind the farmhouse that went north across a ditch to an asparagus field at the top or a hill. As Joe described it, there was a wood ot pine trees on the hillside, and at one point two large boulders sat on each side of the path to the asparagus field. Joe said the area was known to</page><page sequence="18">70 The Concord Saunterer: A. Journal of Thoreau Studies Thoreau as "Two-Boulder Hill" (Figure 9).7 The farm road is no longer passable, but I gained access via the land cultivated by Gaining Ground. Many of the pines have been cut, and the former asparagus field is now a gently sloping mown hay field, but the boulders just below the edge of the field, while hidden in scrub, are over six feet high and still impressive. To the east is a flat table rock. The area suggests a hilltop "Dancing Field" like the one referred to by the late Wampanoag historian, Russell Gardner, which belonged to his ancestors on Martha's Vineyard (Gardner 57). rTTWSRÃ® Figure 9.

Wheeler Collection and the Middlesex School Artifacts The portion of the H.C. Wheeler Collection at the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, Massachusetts, was originally double the Concord Museum's portion, bought as their records show from H.C. Wheeler in 1912. When first received at R.S. Peabody it contained over 1,358 objects, but through deaccessioning, mainly in the 1920s, only 732 artifacts remain, making what is left comparable</page><page sequence="19">Shirley Blancke 71 to the Concord Museum's collection of 725. All except 15 of the 732 artifacts come from Concord, and an original note, while not specifying individual sites, stated that the artifacts came rrom village sites along the Concord River within five or six miles of H.C. Wheeler's house, i.e. the Thoreau Birthplace. The range of artifact types is also comparable to the Concord Museum's collection but more extensive, comprising woodworking tools such as axes, adzes, gouges, celts, and chisels and tools related to hunting and fishing such as spear thrower weights, projectile points, plummets, sinkers, and grooved stones. There were also food and skin preparation tools such as ceramic and stone bowls, drills, gravers, scrapers, edge tools (knives or scrapers), an ulu (semicircular knife), and bifaces (tools of uncertain use flaked on both sides) as well as horticultural and grinding tools such as a hoe, pestles, and a mano (circular grinding stone). Tools and materials related to the making of tools include hammerstones, cores, chipping waste, pre-forms, abrading and polishing stones, and whetstones. In addition there are gorgets (probable wrist protectors), a pendant, a strike-a-light, graphite, and there is a gaming piece. Apart from Concord, eight Massachusetts towns in the general vicinity of Concord as well as further afield were originally listed as site locations. No site identification was made (except for Arlington). In alphabetical order the towns or town districts were: Acton, Bedford, Lexington, Marblehead, Maynard, Mystic Pond in Arlington, North Billerica, North Sudbury, and Sudbury. Of the 15 remaining artifacts, 12 come from Sudbury: a spear thrower weight, eouee. stone pipe, a strike-a-lieht, four scrapers, two ulus, graphite, and a pebble. Two spear thrower weights come from Lexington and the "Wheeler Farm" respectively, and a bifaced implement is from Maynard. "Wheeler Farm" is a name used by old Concord collectors for a site near White Pond, Concord, generally known as Gardner or Anson Wheeler's Farm (his full name was Gardner Anson), and it is assumed this is the site referred to. The current number of H.C. Wheeler artifacts at the Middlesex School is five, with labels for two more. Most have labels of "H.C. Wheeler" attached to them and comprise: a pestle, a celt like axe, a mortar, a gouge, a label that says "Arrow Point Concord" that may belong with an unlabeled Late Woodland Levanna-style projectile point, and two labels that refer to a "Fish-line Sinker" and "Spear-head," which are missing. From Franklin Sanborn's February 21, 1907, newspaper columnâ€”in which he urged Henry Wheeler to</page><page sequence="20">72 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Tboreau Studies give his collection to the school's new Thoreau museum started in 1906â€”it appears that Wheeler gave this handful of artifacts. The school also has a quantity of numbered artifacts given by the Concord collector Adams Tolman out of his 6,000-artifact collection, the rest of which is in the Concord Museum. Tolman's catalog mentions that he gave one of those artifacts, a small circular slate pendant with drill hole from Puffer Field in Sudbury, to the school's Thoreau Museum in 1908. Tolman's father, George, was the original compiler of the Concord Free Public Library's Wheeler genealogy, and for many years, as Secretary of the Concord Antiquarian Society, he curated the collections that became the Concord Antiquarian Museum, now the Concord Museum. The Middlesex School's Thoreau Museum was disbanded, but a description of it may be found in an unpublished paper by the late Stephen F. Ells. Conclusion It was passible to discover the identity of H.C. Wheeler as Henry C. Wheeler of the Thoreau Birthplace in Concord through genealogical research from a starting point provided by a current Wheeler family member in Concord, Joseph C. Wheeler. Genealogical research into the identity of the man who may have sold the collection to the Museum of Primitive Art and Culture in Rhode Island in 1917, Harry E. Wheeler, although suggestive, did not conclusively prove a connection to Henry C. Wheeler. Quotes from Franklin Sanborn about Henry Wheeler collecting Native American artifacts on his farm clinched his identity as a collector who found artifacts on his own land. No conclusion was reached about the location of the archaeological site referred to in a box of artifacts labeled "from a large village site, Concord River, near Thoreau's Farm, Concord, Mass." There are several possible site locations within the old farm area, as well as three Massachusetts Historical Commission listed sites within a mile of the Thoreau farm where Henry C. Wheeler might have collected. While the detective work has successfully elucidated the identity of the artifact collector, pieces of the puzzle remain missing, as is usual in archaeological work. It is clear that an archaeological site existed on the Thoreau Farm, but without knowing its actual locationâ€”whose discovery would require an extensive archaeological surveyâ€”more of the missing pieces that further excavation would</page><page sequence="21">Shirley Blancke 73 provide cannot be added. In a broader context, the Thoreau Farm site is one of over a hundred archaeological sites in Concord, most of which are known only through the efforts of amateur collectors of the past. The earliest of these, it appears, was Henry David Thoreau, though whether he ever collected at his birthplace is not known to me. Subsequent collectors inspired by him, such as Adams Tolman (mentioned above), took collecting to a higher level by numbering all artifacts and recording find spots in notebooks. Identification of these artifacts and sites and the computerization of this data is my ongoing task. One of my aims is to demonstrate settlement patterns at different points in time. This still only represents a first step towards constructing Concord's history from the Ice Age to the Puritan foundersâ€”a step leading toward scientifically conducted excavation and exploration to further fill out a puzzle that can never be fully completed. In the meantime, sites on private land where they are not protected by law are increasingly at risk from building. Thoreau's "Clamshell" site mentioned by Sanborn was one of these, and all we archaeologists could do was examine what was left in collections after its destruction. Acknowledgements I owe a great debt of gratitude to all the people mentioned in this report, without whom this could not have been written. Joe Wheeler's knowledge of Wheeler eenealoev and history answered many questions, and he and Rick Wheeler set me on the right genealogical track. I am especially indebted to Judy Fichtenbaum of the Concord Museum, whose expertise in online genealogical research found the vital connections of the H.C. and H.E. Wheeler families that could be pegged to the Concord Free Public Library's Wheeler genealogy. Tom Blanding's erudition in all things Thoreauvian provided me with the crucial documentary evidence from Franklin Sanborn for the identity of the collector, and he also gave me a copy of Steve Ells' paper on the Middlesex School's Thoreau Museum. Sarah Turnbaugh of the Museum of Primitive Art and Culture in Peace Dale, Rhode Island provided an extensive report on that museum's limited information on the H.C. Wheeler Collection at the time of transfer to the Concord Museum. She also responded with a lengthy discussion to my query about MPAC's original cataloging philosophy, for all of which I am deeply grateful. David</page><page sequence="22">74 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies Wood, Curator at the Concord Museum, accepted this collection of Concord artifacts without knowing if anything further could be found out, so I am glad to have been able to build on his trust. Bonnie Sousa of the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, Massachusetts, responded generously to my questions about their H.C. Wheeler Collection with an outline of their collection. Zaiga Alksnitis of the Middlesex School was able to locate the Wheeler and Tolman artifacts and allowed me to list them. Figure 10. Archaeological periods in Concord, MA Paleoindian 10,000-8,000 B.C.

Figure 10. Archaeological periods in Concord, MA NOTES 1. Henry C. Wheeler, together with Laura Litchfield, sold the Thoreau Farm to G. Frederick Robinson, Ruth Wheeler's father, on December 13, 1915. The deed notes that neither had a spouse but does not state Laura's relationship to Henry (Middlesex Registry of Deeds, Book 4019, p. 436). Other records indicate Henry C. had a daughter, Laura (Figure 1). 2. Harry W. Wheeler, an engraver in Boston, was born in Concord to Benjamin and Mary (Morse) Wheeler and died on December 14, 1909, at the age of 42 (Massachusetts Vital Records). He appears to have had an older brother, Frank K. (US Census 1880). His birth certificate listed his father as Benjamin Franklin Wheeler, and the latter's death certificate named Jotham and Azubah Wheeler as Benjamin's parents (Concord Vital Statistics). Jotham and Azubah belonged to the Sgt. Thomas Wheeler line (Tolman).</page><page sequence="23">Shirley Blancke 75 3.
