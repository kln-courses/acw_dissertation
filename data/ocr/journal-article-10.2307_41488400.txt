In the early twentieth century, ornithology underwent significant changes. So far, these changes, basically, have been studied by focussing on the elite of professional biologists working at universities or state museums. However, important developments also occurred in what Lynn Nyhart has called "the civic realm" of science - the sphere given form by private naturalist associations, nature writers, taxidermists and school teachers. This article studies the changing dynamics of civic ornithology, by looking at one particular case: the influential orinthological observatory in Rossitten, East-Prussia. This observatory, the first of its kind, was founded in 1901 and led, for the first three decades of its existence, by the minister Johannes Thienemann. This article analyses the ornithological practices Thienemann developed in Rossitten and the rhetoric he used to defend these practices. In both, so it is argued, one finds a mixture of the traditional, locally anchored naturalist approach with the new ideals of the "modern" and "experimental" university laboratories. The innovations which Thienemann introduced in this hybrid form of ornithology called for specific spatial strategies which made optimal use of the natural chatacteristics of his workplace and which mobilized a large civic network of geograhically scattered amateurs. At the same time, his work also altered the space he shared with the birds - materially, conceptually and culturally. Thus, this article maintains Thienemann's ornithology can only be understood by acknowledging its continuous interaction with the geographical and civic context in which it arose. Keywords: geography of science, field biology, ornithology, bird-banding, Rossitten, Johannes Thienemann Reviewing the recent developments in his discipline, the German orni- thologist and pastor, Johannes Thienemann stated in 1901 that "espe- cially lately, the consideration of the biological side in the ornithological</page><page sequence="2">172 RAFDEBONT science has been widely recommended."1 The statement reflects a shift commonly acknowledged in the existing historiography of ornithology. Somewhere between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century, so this historiography argues, ornithology moved into the realm of "modern," professionalised biology - in this way, at least partially, leaving the "old" approaches of natural history behind. Before, orni- thology was to a great extent a science of inventory - faunistic and taxonomie in scope, mostly performed by naturalists who were isolated from academic zoology and general biology. Afterwards, the discipline found its way to the biology departments of the universities and leading ornithologists integrated new questions from the fields of ecology, genetics, physiology and evolution (in which they would also perform groundbreaking work themselves). Some have described this shift as a paradigmatic revolution, a quick and drastic change in the theoretical aims and the professional prestige of the discipline.2 Revisionist authors for their part have described it as the consequence of a long process, involving disciplinary negotiations and strategic redefinitions of research aims.3 Even these scholars agree, however, that in most European countries the ornithology of 1940 had become very different from that of the late nineteenth century. The history of the transformation(s) of ornithology in the early decades of the twentieth century is often told as a story of profession- alisation, discipline-building and conceptual renewal. Historians have therefore directed their attention primarily to academic mandarins and influential museum curators. The focus has largely been on ornitholo- gists such as the Harvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, the pioneer ethologist Niko Tinbergen or the leading discipline-builder Erwin Stresemann.4 Yet the multifaceted transformations of ornithology in the early twentieth century affected not only the elite working at the uni- versities and state museums. Important changes also occurred in what historian Lynn K. Nyhart has described as "the civic realm" of science - the "sphere dominated by neither state nor university."5 This was a scientific sphere given form by private naturalist associations and 1 Thienemann, 1901, p. 74.

Late- nineteenth and early-twentieth century ornithology heavily depended on this "civic realm," which provided most of its practitioners. Yet its dynamics largely remain unknown. This article will study these dynamics, by focussing on one practitioner in particular: the already quoted Johannes Thienemann.6 Thienemann was the first leader of the first ornithological observatory in the world, the Vogelwarte in Rossitten, in former East Prussia. The observatory was founded in 1901 as a private, indeed "civic" enterprise. Thienemann - not a professional zoologist, but a minister with a predi- lection for hunting and natural history - would lead the institution for the first 30 years of its existence. Despite its modest beginnings, the practices developed in Rossitten became a model for those of subsequent bird observatories around the world. Without being a great theoriser or a discipline-builder, Thienemann left his mark. He introduced some important changes in field ornithology, in a period that at least partly predates the era of theoretical and disciplinary renewal mentioned above. In this article the transformations of ornithological practices in Rossitten will be studied with special emphasis on the place where they occurred.7 The "civic" setting of Thienemann's enterprise, but also its concrete geographical space and the cultural representations of this space will be under scrutiny. Both, it will be argued, are crucial for understanding the functioning of the Vogelwarte. Rossitten and the local characteristics of its landscape appeared prominently in the work of Thienemann. Locality and folk knowledge, so it becomes clear, were of major importance to him - as they had been in much of traditional nineteenth-century natural history. Yet this localism did not exclude innovation. Thienemann would infuse his traditional, "civic" and local approach with new methods which were at least partially modelled after the "modern" and "experimental" culture developed at the university laboratories. This article will trace this process. It will focus on the question how Thienemann used the natural characteristics of the actual place in which he worked to develop new approaches to the study and protection of living birds. Furthermore it will analyse how, at the same time, he continuously redesigned the space he shared with the 6 Although no central figure in the historiography of science, some commemoration literature exists concerning Johannes Thienemann.

It will study this rede- signing activity on the concrete level in Thienemann's daily work in the station and on the conceptual and the cultural level in his representa- tions of Rossitten to a wider audience. In short, the question this article raises, is how Thienemann used the local characteristics of Rossitten to reshape the practices of early twentieth century "civic" ornithology and how these practices in turn reshaped Rossitten itself. Rossitten, Its Station and Its Nature Despite the strong association with its first director, the Vogelwarte Rossitten was more than an individual project. From its inception, it operated under the auspices of the German Ornithological Society and it was partly sponsored by local and national authorities. Later, in 1923, the Vogelwarte would be brought under the patronage of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. Its task - as published in the bylaws of 1901 - was ambitious. The Vogelwarte had to perform research in the areas of bird migration, behaviour, moult and colour change; it had to devise effec- tive means of protecting birds and investigating their agricultural value; it had to establish a collection of ornithological specimens and procure material for scientific state institutes and, finally, it had to serve as a centre for popularising ornithological knowledge.8 Initially, all this work was to be performed by one man: the director and sole staff member of the station, Johannes Thienemann (Figure 1). Although, it was largely a one-man operation, the idea of setting up a Vogelwarte did not simply materialise out of thin air. At the founding meeting of the German Ornithological Society in 1875, pleas were al- ready heard for research stations for the study of birds and their migrations. As early as 1884, at the First International Ornithological Congress in Vienna, an entire European network of temporary obser- vation posts was developed. In the following decade, this led to an almost endless collection of data with regard to bird migration. In the United Kingdom, for example, lighthouses and lightships were called in to gather as much information as possible.9 Yet, in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, it was hard to actually link the data and nobody was really engaged in processing the observations. The disappointing results eventually prompted European ornithologists to develop a new strategy. Instead of the loose network of temporary posts, the German 8 Thienemann, 1902, pp. 143-145. 9 Allen, 1994, pp. 198-200.</page><page sequence="5">POETRY AND PRECISION 1 7 5 Figure 1. Johannes Thienemann in 1912 (Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, Nachlass Hermann Schalow). Ornithological Society eventually chose to establish one permanently staffed station in a favourable area.10 By designating one particular centre of observation, coordination and accumulation rather than a loose network of temporary posts, the Society opted for a new type of spatial strategy. In this strategy, amongst other figures it was inspired by the work of the painter-ornithologist Heinrich Gätke, who, since the late 1 830s, had been observing migrating birds on the island of Helgoland. It was also Gätke's term of " Vogelwarte " which the German Ornithological Society would use for its first fixed ornithological station.11 10 Stresemann, 1951, pp. 338-341. It lasted for some time before Gätke's private initiative received official following. In 1892 the joint efforts of the Fisheries Union, the Imperial government, the Prussian state government and the German Zoological Society led to the foundation of the Helgoland Biological Research Station. This station bought Gätke's zoological collec- tions, but did not continue his ornithological work. Only in 1909 was an ornithological department founded at the station. Gätke, 1891; Hünemörder, 1995.</page><page sequence="6">176 RAF DE BONT To a certain extent, the idea of a permanent ornithological station echoed the concept of the marine laboratories that had been success- fully established along European coasts from the 1870s onwards.12 Although these stations often focussed on laboratory-oriented research in morphology and physiology, they sometimes also touched upon questions which were quite similar to those which interested the field ornithologist. Marine biologists would, for example, develop large- scale research programmes concerning the migration patterns of commercially exploitable fish such as herring.13 However, the major difference between marine biology and ornithology was that the for- mer was at the mercy of both university interests and the fishing industry, while the latter largely remained the domain of amateur naturalists. Therefore, whereas the former could raise money to set up well-staffed and well-equipped laboratories, the latter had to improvise using the limited financial means available.14 Despite its high aspira- tions, the German Society of Ornithology therefore could only establish a rather humble ornithological research station in the former studio of a landscape painter in Rossitten. The project was not one of the new-fashioned, "professionalising" biological disciplines at the universities. On the contrary, it grew from a Society that - apart from some museum curators - consisted predominantly of military men, schoolteachers, pastors and animal painters, who were not profes- sionally engaged in ornithological research at all.15 The Vogelwarte was, in short, a "civic" enterprise. This enterprise appeared in a cultural context characterised by a growing attraction for the romanticism of the outdoors and the thrill of bird-watching. Rather than collecting dead specimens, early twentieth- century outdoor enthusiasts (both in Europe and the United States) were more and more interested in living birds. 16 The study of these birds in the field - although still largely situated at the margins of elite science - would involve important scientific innovations. A good example is provided by the work on bird behaviour performed by British amateur bird-watchers 12 For a general overview of the history of the late nineteenth-century marine stations in Europe: Kofoid, 1910. 13 See, for example: Jansen, 2002. 14 Allen, 1994, pp. 186-201. 15 One can get a good idea of the composition of the Society by looking at the group images of its yearly gatherings: Haffer, 2003. 16 Particularly for the United States and Britain: Allen, 1994, pp. 201-207; Barrow, 1998, pp. 155-165; Kohler, 2006, pp. 47-90.</page><page sequence="7">POETRY AND PRECISION 177 such as the nature writer Edmund Selous and the factory director Eliot Howard.17 Another example of such innovative research was, indeed, the work that Thienemann would perform in his station in Rossitten. The choice of Rossitten as the place for the foundation of this re- search station seemed logical. Since the late 1880s, several ornithologists had singled out this remote village on the peninsula known as the Kurish Spit as an ideal spot to observe mass bird migrations in autumn and spring.18 In the late nineteenth century the first attempts would also be made to establish a bird observatory there. The first initiative in this direction was taken by Kurt Floericke, a merchant in both stuffed and living birds, who would subsequently have a career as a best-selling nature writer. He managed to set up a modest Verein vergnügter Vogelfreunde ("Society of happy bird lovers") in the 1890s, but his at- tempts to raise funds for a research station failed. Eventually, he decided to leave the peninsula.19 Yet Thienemann took over Floericke's project - even to the extent of marrying the latter's ex-wife. It is no coincidence then that, in the years to come, Floericke would be one of the harshest critics of Thienemann's scientific work.20 Floericke, Thienemann and others had come to Rossitten for various reasons. The most important of these was the abundance of birds. The village was after all located on the path of important migratory routes for which the peninsula, according to Thienemann, served as a "natural direction indicator." Furthermore, the spit was no broader than four kilometres at any point and the whole area could be surveyed from the high dune crests. In the words of Thienemann, the region was "sur- veyable and controllable. (Figure 2)"21 This (supposed) controllability of 17 Burkhardt, 2005, pp. 77-92. More generally on "amateur" science and its shifting borders with "professional" science in the late nineteenth century: Kohlstedt, 1976; Keeney, 1992; Alberti, 2001; Vanpaemel, 2006. Thienemann's study friend, the pastor and ornithologist Friedrich Lindner, seems to have been the first to have 'discovered' Rossitten as a place of bird migration. He visited the village for the first time in 1888 together with the animal painter Heinrich Krüger. The latter's studio would eventually serve as the first museum building at the Vogelwarte. Schiiz, 1938, pp. 470-471. 19 Floericke, 1894. 20 Floericke almost immediately published a Kritik der Tätigkeit der Vogelwarte Rossitten. In this pamphlet, he showed himself particularly angry that his early work had not been referenced by Thienemann, but was nonetheless heavily used. Furthermore Floericke stressed that Thienemann's ornithological publications did not surpass the level of those of the average schoolmaster and that, despite phrases about bird pro- tection, he killed birds 'en masse'. In his view the Vogelwarte was nothing but 'a sinecure for a theologian gone to the dogs'. Floericke, 1902. Thienemann, 1902, p. 149.</page><page sequence="8">178 RAFDEBONT Figure 2. The 'isolated' location of Rossitten was considered crucial for the scientific work performed there, (from: Thienemann, Rossitten , p.7). the spit was rooted in its spatial isolation, since it was almost entirely surrounded by large bodies of water. As such, its natural geography made it particularly interesting for field research. It was this same isolation that would make the Solomon Islands so appealing for Ernst Mayr's studies on evolution, or that triggered ecologist Stephen A. Forbes to conceptualise Lake Mendota in Wisconsin as an ecological microcosm.22 Yet the Kurish Spit was not only a well-circumscribed and survey- able area, it was also isolated in the more popular sense of the word. Around 1900, Rossitten was a small fishing community on the outskirts of the German Reich. In summer it was accessible by steamboat; in winter one had to endure a 12-hour cart-ride through roadless lands to 22 Schneider, 2000; Kohler, 2002, pp. 257-262.</page><page sequence="9">POETRY AND PRECISION 1 79 the nearest town.23 Pioneering scientists such as Floericke and Thiene- mann presented this as an advantage, however. Unlike other places of ornithological interest - such as the oft-visited seaside resort Helgoland - life was still cheap in turn-of-the-century-Rossitten and there was no beach tourism to disturb research.24 If one wanted to study living birds for a longer period of time, Thienemann argued in 1910, one had to settle in unspoiled, free nature, just as some meteorologists had to settle in the mountains.25 Thienemann thus echoed an age-old theme that associated knowledge with isolation. The seclusion in Rossitten was nothing if not a scientific necessity.26 At the same time, the loneliness of the scientist was also presented as being agreeable. In his later work in particular Thienemann would stress the romanticism of his isolated existence, stressing the originality of the area, the poetry of its wildness and the primitive living conditions (far away from big-city life). The Kurish Spit was scientifically interesting as well as spiritually inspiring. "We become so small and humble in this majestic wild nature," Thie- nemann wrote in 1930.27 All this does not mean, however, that Thienemann advocated pre- serving the nature of the Kurish Spit in its original state. Although he would invest a lot of energy in the study of bird protection, especially in the early days of the station, he actually aimed at drastically changing the existing wildlife population in the area. Thienemann's view of bird protection was, after all, essentially a utilitarian one. He wanted to improve the household of nature by artificially increasing the number of "useful" animals and exterminating the so-called "vermin."28 In this project, he was inspired by his friend, the officer, ornithologist and popular writer, Hans Freiherr von Berlepsch, who had been experi- menting with nesting boxes and winter feeding since the 1880s. In the German bird protection movement, Von Berlepsch's instrumental and managerial ideas were fairly prominent throughout the nineteenth century - as they were in other Western countries. In the early 1900s, these ideas would gradually be challenged by more ethically, aestheti- cally and holistically inspired arguments. Birds - whether useful or not - increasingly gained an emotional appeal and nature was more and more romanticised as a place of harmony in which every animal had its task. 23 Thienemann, 1930, pp. 65-73. 24 Floericke, 1894, pp. 233-235; Thienemann, 1910a, pp. 534-535. 25 Thienemann, 1910b, p. 6. 26 On this theme, see for instance Shapin, 1990; Gieryn, 2002. 27 Thienemann, 1930, p. 14. 28 Thienemann, 1902, p. 207; Idem, 1911, p. 623.</page><page sequence="10">180 RAFDEBONT Later, early animal ecologists would indirectly support these ideas by stating that predators played a key role in the balance of the ecosys- tem.29 Thienemann, however, stuck to the old managerial school of thought for a very long time. Only after his retirement did he adapt his viewpoint. In a posthumously published book, he stated that every organism had its role to play in the "household of nature."30 Yet his earlier protection projects seem to suppose quite the contrary. And throughout the years these projects definitely drastically changed Thienemann's actual workplace. One of the first managerial projects at the Vogelwarte was the at- tempt to artificially introduce hole-nesters to the Kurish Spit - a bird group that was, so far, largely absent from the region. Berlepschian nesting boxes were hung, "feeding trees" mounted and "warmth apparatuses" installed. By numbering and regularly checking the nest- ing boxes, Thienemann tried to monitor his introduction experiment scientifically. The goal of the "protection research" was strictly utili- tarian since hole-nesters, especially tits, were thought to be beneficial in the fight against the insect plagues that threatened Prussian forestry and agriculture. To help the tits survive the winter, Thienemann would even feed them the carcasses of sparrows (birds with a far less positive rep- utation). Later, he would also experiment with floating nesting boxes on the sea, in the hope of increasing the "production" of gull eggs in the region. Carnivores, on the other hand, were hunted down. Thienemann would for example encourage the killing of foxes in the Rossitten re- gion, in order to augment the hare population. In all these projects, he enjoyed the support of "civic" groups such as agricultural societies and hunting circles, whose utilitarian view of nature and economic agendas he shared. Through the contacts with these groups, the "experiment" in Rossitten could also be exported to the surrounding countryside. As early as 1902, Thienemann distributed 2000 Berlepschian nesting boxes throughout East Prussia as part of a project to contain the epidemics of processionary caterpillars.31 Soon, a nesting box factory would open a branch in the area.32 29 Schmoll, 2005.

As early as 1903, Thienemann started his so-called bird banding experiment, which he would continue until his retirement and which would earn his station an international reputation. The idea of banding birds was not new, but it was only taken up systematically by the Danish schoolteacher Hans Mortensen in 1899. When Thienemann heard about the new research tool, he was immediately enthused. "Before," he recollected in 1922, "the research ended when the bird had flown over. Now it continued."33 To use Bruno Latour's terminology, one might say the rings attached to the bird's feet served as "immutable mobiles," which could be used to reconstruct the bird's route and which allowed "the centre" (Rossitten) "to act at a distance."34 People who observed ringed birds (dead or occasionally alive) could report them to Thienemann and return the ring to him. Using a system of numbers printed on the ring, Thienemann was able to identify the individual bird in question and the route it had taken. The system obviously only included a relatively small sample of birds but, nonetheless, early experiments had an immediate effect. Within just a few weeks of the first birds being released, ringed speci- mens were already being reported. Thienemann himself was surprised by the success. "I really did not assume I would have results so quickly," he wrote to an ornithologist friend in November 1903. 35 Despite the successes with banding, Thienemann also tried out other techniques. Ringed birds could not be recognised from far away so experiments were devised using specimens marked with colourful paint. These alternative techniques were quickly abandoned, however. The painted birds made a "pathetic impression" according to Thienemann and the paint came off after just a few months. Yet Thienemann's most important objection was that painted birds were no longer "natural" research objects. While rings were believed not to take birds beyond the realm of nature, paint actually turned them into "objects of art."36 The system of banding was developed for different kinds of birds, but the bulk of the experiments in Rossitten nonetheless focussed on a limited number of species. The choice of species was a practical one and 33 Thienemann, 1922, p. 61. Latour, 1987, p. 228. Thienemann to Hermann Schalow, 21 November 1903, Nachl.

A Rossitten 'crow-catcher' (AMPIO, Radolfzell). intimately linked with the possibilities his concrete workplace offered (Figure 3). At first, Thienemann mostly worked with hooded crows. The Kurish Spit after all had a significant number of "crow-catchers," who caught thousands of crows annually for human consumption. It was easy and cheap to procure living specimens from them. In other words, Thienemann had an auxiliary workforce immediately to hand. Moreover, the chance of recovering the rings was fairly high since - in the words of Thienemann - "no hunter leaves a crow unshot when it flies over within shooting distance."37 Thienemann also discovered rather quickly that the Kurish Spit constituted a bottleneck in the migration of hooded crows. In his later work, he would write that the Spit is nothing less than, "the place where one can feel the pulse of this great migratory organism; it is the touchstone of what goes on in this vast hustle and bustle."38 Rossitten, so he claimed, was one of the only places where one could survey large populations, while working at one and the same spot. In his choice of his workplace (and his conceptualisation of it) Thiene- mann showed his aptitude in the development of what Robert Kohler has called "practices of place." Or, to continue with Kohler's terminology, Thienemann selected and manipulated his workplace in such a way that his observations and comparisons would reveal "how nature works."39 Gradually, Thienemann extended the number of reference species with which he worked. In 1905, he began large-scale experiments with black-headed gulls. These had similar advantages to those of crows. The gulls were very common in Rossitten; using nets it was easy to catch 37 Thienemann, 1904, p. 281. 38 Thienemann, 1930, p. 149. 39 For the term 'practices of place': Kohler, 2002, p. 212.</page><page sequence="13">POETRY AND PRECISION 1 83 their young when they swam on the water and adults could be obtained from local crow-catchers. Often hunted, the rings also came back in rather high percentages.40 In 1906, Thienemann also began to include white storks in his research. These were far less hunted - at least in Europe - but they were big and conspicuous, cherished by the local population, and they had the advantage of being able to carry rather heavy rings containing a lot of information. Finally, the stork was also the prototypical migratory bird flying south. This bird would soon become the unofficial emblem of the station.41 The successes with banding crows, gulls and storks did not quash all criticism of Thienemann's project. Critics argued that the aluminium harmed the birds' legs and that the already declining groups of migra- tory birds would be killed more often in order to recover the rings. It was painful for Thienemann that this criticism was heard particularly in a "civic" world he himself tried to master: the world of nature writing with its mixed interests in conservationism, hunting and the populari- sation of science. Kurt Floericke - by then editor of the influential popular science journal Kosmos - led the attempts to discredit Thiene- mann. Floericke described bird-banding as "vein scientific humbug" and predicted "mass murdering of storks." In his attacks, his supporters included the popular nature writer and "poet of the heath" Hermann Löns. In his best selling Mümmelman: Ein Tierbuch [Hare: An Animal Book], Löns took up a conversation between two crows highly critical of the Vogelwarte. Thienemann, so the crows were convinced, ordered "that crows everywhere be shot and their feet sent to him, in the name of science." Elsewhere, Löns criticised Thienemann for his presumed "collection mania," thus associating him with out-of-date natural his- tory practices rather than the state-of-the-art aura the director of the Vogelwarte was seeking for himself. As an "animal lover," Löns stressed that he believed "one single stork to be more beautiful and more useful than all ornithologists taken together."42 His criticism clearly reflected the growing role that an "emotional" attachment to animals started to play in the world of German, and indeed Western, nature protection.43 Yet, the bird-banding "experiment" outlived the criticism and Thie- nemann continued to increase its scale. This expansion went hand-in- hand with a change of strategy. Thienemann's idea to start banding storks 40 Thienemann, 1906, p. 462. 41 Thienemann, 1907, p. 531; Idem, 1930, pp. 218-219. 42 Floericke, 1908, pp. 40-41; Löns, 1909, p. 25; Idem, 1910, pp. 440-441.

Doughty, 1975; Schmoll, 2005.</page><page sequence="14">184 RAF DE BONT was indicative in this respect. After all, storks were rarely, if ever, seen in Rossitten.44 Thienemann could only study them by distributing rings to amateur bird-banders in neighbouring territories where the species was more common. He made sure everyone knew that Rossitten delivered its rings to all amateurs, "free of charge and postage paid."45 Thienemann's strategy echoed that of the large-scale surveys of turn-of-the-century plant ecology, which also basically relied on the recording work of large groups of amateurs.46 The success of the strategy was immediate and Thiene- mann extended the system to other species as well. Soon, the birds ringed outside Rossitten easily outnumbered those ringed at the station itself. Thienemann recruited state foresters, zoology professors and wealthy landlords throughout the country to be responsible for ringing. He prided himself on the fact that he took his time to develop this network because he believed only personal contacts guaranteed the trustworthiness of the information.47 Rossitten remained the centre where all the data were gathered, but only some of the birds represented by crosses on Thiene- mann's maps actually flew over his station. To be sure, Thienemann continued to observe individual specimens in the field, but he was only a virtual observer of the majority of the birds he monitored. In addition to a network of volunteers to ring birds, Thienemann obviously also needed people to report the finds and send him back the rings that were found. Therefore, he invested a great deal in publicising his project throughout the country. He lectured to all kinds of scientific and agricultural societies, showing slides and eventually films; he organised summer courses and published his work in hunting journals and natural history magazines. Those who reported finds were rewarded by the fact that Thienemann included their names in his lengthy annual reports. Thanks to these, we have a fairly good idea of the diversity of the people engaged in the project. Noblemen, soldiers and school- teachers often appeared in the lists, as well as foresters and hunters, state officials, students, physicians and pharmacists. Professional orni- thologists often acted as intermediaries between Thienemann and the field workers 48 They also proved of great value in sending him articles 44 Thienemann, 1908, p. 406. 45 Thienemann, 1913b, p. 2. 46 These have, again, particularly been described for Great Britain. See e.g. Lowe, 1976, pp. 517-535. 47 Thienemann, 1906, p. 431. 48 These included, among others, Johan Axel Palmén (Finland), Eduard van Oort (the Netherlands), Robert Poney (Switzerland), Jakob Schenk (Hungary) and Dimitri von Kaygodoroff (Russia).</page><page sequence="15">POETRY AND PRECISION 185 from local newspapers and hunting magazines, reporting on finds of ringed birds. Obviously, as Thienemann himself observed, his "winged research objects flew, without taking political borders into account."49 For finds outside Germany, German expatriates initially played a role, but very soon many volunteers of other nationalities also became in- volved in the project. For reports of finds in the Middle East and Africa Thienemann relied on colonial networks. Often, the natives made the original find (by shooting a stork for example), but it was only the colonials who reported it. Missionaries, embassy staff and colonial scientists played key roles as go-betweens. Monitoring the migration of storks from Scandinavia to South Africa - the most well-known project of the station - relied in large part on a cultural milieu shaped by western imperialism.50 The First World War disturbed international collaboration for a while, but Thienemann was quick to re-establish the old contacts. Un- like other German scientists, he openly distanced himself from aggres- sive nationalism in this context. "Tiny aluminium rings," so he wrote in 1919, "are able to further relations between nations." As a result of the extended networks involved, Thienemann argued that his study of bird migration was nothing if not internationalist. It was "the common la- bour of the races" and "a work of peace."51 At the same time, however, he also stressed the role that his work could play in the growing Heimatliebe in Germany itself. In Thienemann's own view, his lectures to local youth and his popular courses not only popularised science, but also strengthened the general sense of the Heimat by alerting people to the beauty of local nature. This mixture of science, conservationism and the promotion of Heimatliebe was by no means exceptional. It was widespread in the German environmental protection movement of the early twentieth century.52 More striking is that the theme of the Heimat also found its way into Thienemann's actual studies of bird migration. Was it not the sense of the Heimat or even straightforward Heimatliebe that guided migratory birds back to their original nests? These birds might have been international travellers, but they were also strongly locally rooted. Thienemann (and many others) perceived this rootedness 49 Thieneman, 1912, pp. 133-243. 50 See, for instance: Thienemann, 1910a, pp. 620-624; Idem, 1912, pp. 144-147. 51 Thienemann, 1921, p. 13; Idem, 1922, p. 62. 52 On the role of the Heimat concept among German conservationists: Williams, 2006, pp. 339-384.</page><page sequence="16">186 RAFDEBONT as both natural and ethically good - with regard to both birds and people.53 Experimental Field Culture When referring to his work of bird-banding, Thienemann systematically spoke of an "experiment." The term had a strong rhetorical power, suggesting a laboratory-like precision. Writing about the "banding experiment," Thienemann stated: "All hypotheses end there; facts are created. That is what makes experiments so attractive."54 Of course, Thienemann's bird-banding was not an "experiment" in the sense it received in nineteenth-century laboratory biology.55 It was performed in "real nature" and manipulation was kept to a minimum (not to interfere with the birds' natural behaviour). Thienemann, however, used the term to indicate that his work delivered precise, controllable facts, unlike the earlier, more hypothetical migration studies. It was largely a semantic trick to associate his research with the prestige of the cutting-edge work of the laboratory sciences. He was not the only scientist to use this trick, for that matter. Despite their rootedness in natural history, various aspiring field biologists of the period (ranging from American plant ecologists to French ethologists) would do exactly the same.56 After having worked out the banding system, Thienemann tried to expand his "experimental" approach to other aspects of ornithology as well. Amongst other things, he developed an "experiment" to study the speed of the bird's flight. For this, Thienemann would retreat to Ul- menhorst - an annex of the station, opened in 1908, in a "world-for- gotten place" some seven kilometres outside Rossitten. The Spit was at its most narrow here and migrating birds tended to fly over it in straight lines. Again, Thienemann demonstrated his skill in developing scientific "practices of place." He would set up two observation posts connected by field telephones (Figure 4). The task of the observer at the first post was to spot a bird flying over, to start a chronometer and to contact the second observer over the telephone. The latter would give a telephone signal when the bird flew over the second post. Using some rudimentary 53 Thienemann, 1913b, p. 8; Idem, 1922, pp. 65-66; Idem, 1923, pp. 145-146; Idem, 1933, p. 63.

Experimental fieldwork: Thienemann measuring the speed of the bird's flight (from: Thienemann, Rossitten , p.248). measuring instruments, it was also possible to take the speed and direction of the wind into account. The set-up was far from spectacular, but the results were generally seen as innovative. At least, they were thought to be more precise than any estimates so far.57 Other field "experiments" Thienemann developed in Ulmenhorst concerned the altitude of flight. This issue had been heavily debated ever since Gätke started to publish on the subject in the 1840s, developing the theory that birds generally flew at a height of several thousand metres.58 Thienemann tried to falsify these hypotheses experimentally. He did so particularly in interaction with his friend, the lieutenant, amateur ornithologist, hunter and popular writer Friedrich von Luc- anus. Thanks to his military background, Lucanus was able to carry out various observations using hot air balloons from the Prussian army. Among other things, he released birds at different altitudes, noticing that they would only leave the immediate vicinity of the balloon once land was in sight. Furthermore, he suspended stuffed specimens under the balloon to investigate up to what altitude they were actually perceivable from the ground.59 Thienemann was inspired by Lucanus, 57 Thienemann, 1930, pp. 246-250. 58 Gätke, 1891, pp. 46-64. See, for instance: Von Lucanus, 1902, pp. 1-9; Idem , 1922. On Lucanus' ornitho- logical activities, see Gebhart (2006, p. 224).</page><page sequence="18">188 RAF DE BONT but his station did not have a balloon at its disposal. The station's director therefore set up improvised "experiments" with stuffed birds suspended under kites or placed on high poles in order to estimate the altitude of passing birds in its environment. He admitted that such "experiments" were somewhat primitive, but valued them above earlier estimates with no reference points whatsoever.60 Thienemann hoped modern technology - especially airplanes - would eventually solve the question in a more precise manner, by enabling the scientists "to transcend time and space."61 Thanks to occasional collaboration with the gliding pioneer and popular hero Ferdinand Schulz, Thienemann was able to take a step in this direction. Rossitten, with its long dune strips and particular upward currents, proved exceptionally suitable not only for bird-watching but also for gliding. In the early 1920s Schulz set several world records in Rossitten and (from 1925 onwards) the village would also be home to the world's first gliding society.62 The "practices of place" of gliders and ornithologists thus partly overlapped at the Kurish Spit and Thiene- mann was very proud to incorporate some observations by the renowned Schulz in his later work.63 As indicated, Thienemann's "experiments" on the speed and altitude of flight scarcely entailed any manipulation of variables by the scientist. In the late 1920s, however, he developed "experiments" that also incorporated this element of prototypical laboratory culture. The ques- tion Thienemann concentrated on during this period was how migratory birds actually oriented themselves. He wanted to know whether young birds learn migration routes by accompanying their parents or whether they follow a genetically inherited instinct. To actually test this, Thie- nemann devised his so-called "release research." From 1926 onwards, young storks that had been reared in Rossitten were released, but only after the older birds had already left. To monitor this precious group as closely as possible, Thienemann again resorted to modern technology. He announced the release of the storks on local and national radio stations, thus triggering increased awareness among the population. The strategy worked and Thienemann received particularly detailed reports. Reports from outside Germany were fewer in number, but enough to gain a general picture. Overall, the birds largely seemed to follow the normal route, but eventually turned west, whereas most of the older 60 Thienemann, 1913a, pp. 51-52; Idem, 1930, pp. 259-262.

The results, in other words, were somewhat mixed and Thienemann - close to his retirement - was not able to settle the orientation question completely.64 It still preoccupies scientists today. The Hat of the Hunter In the 30 years he worked at Rossitten, Thienemann clearly incorpo- rated some conceptual and material elements of modern laboratory science in the field. He conceptualised the space in which he worked in such a way that he could isolate the phenomena he wanted to study. He introduced new measuring techniques and went on to manipulate the organisms with which he worked. Yet, in other aspects his attitude was far from the ideal of the lab. On several occasions, he would stress that zoology had become too laboratory-oriented and that it "urgently needed more field work, outside in free nature."65 Thienemann himself had no contact whatsoever with the new zoological laboratories, which had been erected at the universities in the late nineteenth century.66 He was an autodidact, who would not receive his degree in zoology until he reached the age of 45. Almost immediately he was appointed professor at the University of Königsberg, but he remained very much an outsider there.68 He would never become a typical academic (Figure 5). When appearing in public his clothing was not unlike that of the woodsman - wearing high boots and a hunter's hat, very unlike the more formal costume of the average metropolitan scientist. In the end, he belonged to the "amateur" natural history tradition, much more than that of professionalising experimental biology. Thienemann was a late representative of a non-academic, rural tra- dition of nature study, in which the parsonage rather than the university was the centre of knowledge. In nineteenth-century Germany, evan- gelical ministers (including Thienemann's direct ancestors) had played an important role in the development of this nature study, particularly in the field of ornithology. The work of these pastors had been practical, rather than theoretical, closely connected to hunting and agronomy, teaching and popularisation - as indeed was the work of Thienemann 64 Thienemann, 1930, pp. 285-300. 65 Thienemann, 1912, p. 620. 66 On the rise of laboratory culture in late nineteenth century biology: Benson and Keith 1991, pp. 49-83. 67 Schiiz, 1938, p. 479. 68 Berthold and Schlenker, 1995, p. 583.</page><page sequence="20">190 RAF DE BONT Figure 5.

Although he would break away from the overt natural theology and anthropomorphism of nineteenth century evangelical nature writ- ing, Thienemann could not hide his roots.69 Despite his occasional collaboration with laboratory-trained zoologists, he would never really become integrated into their world. Thienemann functioned in a network that differed significantly from that of the average academic laboratory scientist. Whereas the latter conducted his science primarily in his "intramural counterparts" 69 Both Thienemann's father, August Wilhelm, and his grandfather, Georg August Wilhelm, were evangelical ministers known for their ornithological work. The latter often collaborated with Christian Ludwig Brehm, one of the figureheads of the 'Golden Age' of German ornithology in the mid-nineteenth century and (again) a pastor.

The same is in fact true of his activities. In addition to his scientific work - and almost intrinsically connected to it - Thienemann hunted, reared fowl, lectured on agriculture and guided influential military men and politicians around the Kurish Spit. Thienemann certainly used his heterogeneous network and multiple identities to his advantage, but these also created their particular kinds of problem. From his early days at the Spit, Thienemann was at odds with the local dune inspector, who charged him with game theft and who even conducted a domiciliary visit to his house. In a letter to Berlin, Thienemann stressed how this undermined his prestige with the local population. Later, several conflicts ensued between Thienemann and Rossitten's chief state forester. The two continuously competed over the municipal hunting lease and their relationship quickly became sour. On several occasions the state forester openly turned against Thiene- mann, accusing him of unlawfully collecting eggs and entering certain forbidden areas. Eventually this led to Thienemann being summoned by his superiors to Berlin.71 The Kurish Spit may have been easily con- trollable in a geographical sense, but actual control of the region also implied power in the social domain. Here, Thienemann's mixed profile was sometimes more of a hindrance than an advantage. Nonetheless, Thienemann continued explicitly to cultivate his image of a hunter and an outdoorsman - rather than that of a scientist's scientist. This also left its mark on his published work. Unlike academic scientists, he only rarely referred to the state of the art in his research field, stressing that he had no interest in "armchair learning."72 His publications were to give a first-hand account of his personal work in the field. This was translated into long descriptive lists (of ring finds, for example), but also into all kinds of anecdotes in his annual reports. In the reports of 1923 and 1924, for example, he talks at length about a stork found in Spain with a "Negro arrow" in its back, which Thie- nemann - thanks to the intervention of an ethnographer - was able to 70 The quotation comes from Livingstone (2003, p. 42). 71 The hunting lease conflict also led to a direct conflict with Thienemann's prepar- ator, who was fired in 1916.

The same mechanism can be found in the small museum he set up at the Vogelwarte. Alongside rows of stuffed specimens, which inventoried the bird species of Rossitten, one could also admire a "rarity cabinet," displaying the objects relating to Thienemann's anecdotes: the "Negro arrow" in question, next to all kinds of ringed bird legs and the rubbish found in stork nests, from ladies' gloves to a potato. To Thienemann's mind, these elements made his research tangible to both the general public and the popular press - two groups he desper- ately needed to actually perform his work. Anecdotes, so he indicated elsewhere, showed that his work was not only about precision but also carried a strong sense of romanticism. In 1917, he stated: "There is so much poetry, so much mysteriousness in this research! [...] When such a little piece of metal, which has left my writing table, has been carried over countries and seas, has dived into the waters of the Nile, has dried in the Kalahari Desert, has been stared at or worshipped by wild black people, and then suddenly shows up again at my writing table, then this small ring always brings me a special kind of magic."76 It was this same kind of magic that Thienemann wanted to offer to the readers of his publications and the visitors to his museum. Authenticity and Manliness Much of Thienemann's anecdotes were written in a humorous, some- what masculine tone - not uncommon in the hunting literature of the time.77 This is especially true of his later best-selling books, in which he 73 Thienemann, 1926, p. 85. The phenomenon of this type of Pfeilstorch (or "arrow stork") was not new. In 1822, one had already been reported in the German village of Kliitz.

Yet, in other national contexts (such as Germany) rather similar identities seem to have existed. See inter alia MacKenzie, 1988; Mckenzie, 2005.</page><page sequence="23">POETRY AND PRECISION 193 portrayed the roughness of the Kurish Spit and the hardships of working there. Thienemann made clear that he disliked "sentimental" animal protectors and he wrote sympathetically about schnapps- drinking, wife-beating fishermen or crow-catchers who killed crows with a single bite.78 In his most popular book, Rossitten: Drei Jahrzehnte auf der kurischen Nehrung [Rossitten: Three Decades on the Kurish Spit], he described the so-called Kentucky Club in detail, which he formed at Rossitten and which was basically a group of gun-lovers. To become a member of the club, one had to shoot a pig using a single bullet; to become its president one needed to have received at least one shot wound and then healed without medical assistance. Members smoked pipes (not effeminate cigarettes) and paid with cartridges (not pernicious money). They aimed at moral and bodily discipline through a tough way of life: "The Boys - as the members are called - have to scrupulously avoid everything effeminate and prissy."79 Thienemann said all this in jest, but of course nothing is more serious than humour. The self-image he maintained was strongly associated with the impression he gave of his scientific work. Observing birds in Rossitten was nothing for spoiled city dwellers, but rather for fearless, manly and practically-oriented huntsmen like himself. Thienemann's publications spread the image of the unspoiled Ros- sitten throughout Germany. His books were reprinted various times, editions for children appeared and postcards of the region were dis- tributed.80 In 1928, Thienemann even issued a four-reel movie called Im Lande des Vogelzuges [In the Land of the Bird Migration], shot by the Berlin company Hubert Schubert and directed by Thienemann himself. The film closely followed the story of Thienemann's Rossitten, but translated it for an even broader audience. Just like the book, the film combined a portrait of the land and the customs of its inhabitants with an explanation of the scientific work at the station. The first part was particularly used to stress the originality and unspoiled character of the Kurish Spit. The opening text was clear in this regard: "Just as authentic and remarkable as the Spit itself are its inhabitants." Shots followed of traditional fishing boats and horse-drawn carriages, crow-catchers and weather-beaten fishermen casting their nets through a hole in the ice. The scientific story was told in a similar anecdotal fashion. Shots of 78 Thienemann, 1910a, p. 537; Idem, 1930, pp. 211-212; Idem, 1939, p. 68.

All this nationwide attention meant that the Vogelwarte attracted a growing number of amateur ornithologists and nature-loving tourists. By the year of Thienemann's death, the small village had seven hotels, as well as numerous bed and breakfasts. Tourist brochures praised the broad beaches and the quiet of the traditional, car-free village.82 Yet, the growing number of visitors, attracted by images of unspoiled nature, drastically changed the place itself. Thienemann's own attitude towards this invasion was ambiguous. It was good for the reputation of the Vogelwarte (and thus for the migration experiment) and it enabled him to present his station "as an outpost of culture in the middle of the 'desert'." At the same time, however, he openly lamented rising prices and the disappearing wildness of the area.83 In his books he therefore preferred to write about the good old days. Thienemann's reaction to the tourist development of Rossitten reflects the ambiguity typical of his nature image.

Historian Donald Worster has described these as "arcadianism" and "imperialism" - the first being nostalgic and striving for a life in close harmony with nature, the second aiming at a dominion of nature (amongst other means through science).84 Thienemann - and arguably many naturalists with him - strove for both. The old, authentic Rossitten untainted by tourism was to be both civilised and preserved. Together with many scientists of his time, Thienemann shared an "enlightened" civilising mission, a love of technology and a strong belief in progress, but he was also a cultural pessimist, criticising the artificiality of much of modern culture and longing for a refuge of authenticity. Rossitten in many ways offered such a refuge and Thie- nemann would romanticise its original state. As a 70-year-old, he de- scribed how the unspoiled landscape had touched him when he first visited the place: "On the Kurish Spit I felt the sense of the magnificent, the new and the undiscovered and I came to know life in a form un- touched by the outside world, so full of romance, so unspoiled, rough, rugged and primitive."85 In letters to Berlin friends, Thienemann paraded his self-chosen loneliness in backward East Prussia, describing how he was "living in the dunes, with my dog, far from all human culture."86 Then, during the First World War, he seemed to mind most that the military violence had altered the original state of the Kurish Spit: "maybe the only piece of land in Germany with unalloyed nature."87 Yet, at the same time, the self-proclaimed woodsman did not always cope well with the hardships of the place where he lived. In 1910 he requested the permission of the German Ornithological Society to spend his winters in the provincial town of Cranz instead of in the dark, isolated village of Rossitten. A few years later, he even made the metropolitan city of Königsberg his winter quarters.88 In the last article he was to publish, Thienemann wrote that anxiety often came over him when, after a visit to Berlin, he travelled back to the Kurish Spit. He would longingly think back to the "shining bars with clean people, beautiful women, tailcoats, top hats, cham- pagne, oysters - in short, big-city life." But eventually, so he suggested, his love of nature and authenticity would always prevail. He stated that swarms of migratory birds observed from a dune crest always erased his 84 Worster, 1977, pp. 378-379. 85 Thienemann, 1936, p. 172.

His name was Ernst Schüz. Although Schüz would clearly build on Thienemann's work, he also differed from his prede- cessor in many ways. Unlike Thienemann, Schüz was trained as a professional biologist and, as a former student of the omnipresent Er- win Stresemann, he was well-acquainted with the ins and outs of the profession. Schüz may well have liked many aspects of Thienemann's work, but he clearly wanted to set matters on a new footing once he joined the staff in 1929. He founded a new journal, redesigned the Vogelwarte museum and introduced a new vocabulary, more laden with jargon. For instance, the term "ecology" would appear for the first time in the station's publications.90 Schüz also strengthened the station's laboratory focus. In one of his annual reports he wrote that this was "simply a duty with regard to the scientific prestige of the station."91 He launched histological and physiological research projects, particularly focussing on the effects of hormones on bird migration. Microscopes and microtomes were bought, as well as extraction appliances, ther- mostats and a vacuum distillation machine.92 It was not only the material situation of the Vogelwarte that changed. The political milieu in which the station operated also changed drasti- cally. Once the National Socialists were in charge, the station depended directly on the politically dominated Notgemeinschaft der Deutsche Wissenschaft. In official documents, Schüz and his Berlin director Oskar Heinroth suddenly started to stress the strategic importance of orni- thological field work at the Kurish Spit for the Deutschtum - since the 89 Thienemann, 1936, p. 176. 90 Schüz, 1930, pp. 105-113, 1932.

In an article dated 1934, Schüz referred to this role when he rhetorically asked: "Will this duty ever find more approval than today, a time when Blut und Boden - with the words of the Führer as the building blocks of our Volk - are measured using another, better standard than ever before?"94 Yet, despite such rhetoric, the actual scientific work at the Vogelwarte seemed not to have been influenced too much by the change of regime. A project devised by Himmler in 1942 to use the storks from Rossitten to spread political propaganda was suc- cessfully countered by Schüz.95 Thienemann was not to live to witness Himmler's plans, nor the take- over of the station by the Soviets in 1945. During his lifetime, however, Rossitten had already changed drastically, as had the science that was performed there. The place where pioneers such as Floericke made a few isolated observations in the 1890s was a far cry from the place which hosted Schüz's well-equipped station in the 1930s. Roads had been constructed, bakeries had opened and the foxtrot had replaced the traditional dances. Nesting boxes had been put up, new species had been introduced, a museum had been built and redesigned several times and field annexes had been founded. In 1901, the station's equipment largely consisted of binoculars and a gun; 40 years later, all kinds of laboratory equipment had been introduced. In the scientific world, the name of the village had become internationally known. It spread all over the world - printed on metal rings. Ornithologists knew that Rossitten was a "bottleneck" on the routes of migratory birds, as well as a centre for the accumulation of ornithological knowledge. The station hosted only a small staff but eventually it welcomed many visiting scientists and mobilised amateurs on three continents. In Germany, Rossitten became an icon of unspoiled wilderness, attracting tens of thousands of tourists each year. Thienemann stood in the midst of these changes. He introduced a new kind of ornithology, not through novel theoretical concepts, but 93 In the same documents, the lighthouse keeper with whom the station collaborated was explicitly described as "a Memelland-Lithuanian, not a Great-Lithuanian" and it was stressed that his education had been "German through and through."

After Thienemann's appointment at the university of Konigsberg and Schüz's selection as director of the station, academic culture did make its way to Rossitten, but only partially so. The older non-academic traditions and networks lived on and remained crucial for the station's functioning well into the 1930s. Thienemann might have been inspired by the "experimentalist" tradition, but above all he was a hunter-naturalist, who sought poetry as much as precision. Thienemann turned the Kurish Spit into a "laboratory of nature" and initiated the construction of a scientific infrastructure on the peninsula, where he introduced, caught, ringed, chronometered, bred and shot birds. Additionally - as an integral part of his science - he put a great deal of effort into making his workplace known among fellow scientists, ama- teurs and the general public. While doing so, he subsequently presented Rossitten as an outpost of civilisation, a centre of modern science and a place of wilderness and masculinity. In all these ways, a small village in East Prussia was simultaneously transformed into a genuine scientific workplace, a conceptual tool and a cultural icon.
