<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Buddhism does produce a spirit of resignation is acknowledged by Rowley, who indeed expresses the judgment that Buddhist submission is deeper in its resignation than that of Hinduism, because of the feeling that life itself is evil. While wholly passive, Buddhist resignation to suffering may include a joyful exaltation. It is not unfair to say, however, that this is frequently true when one submits to anything that seems inevitable. Confucianism and Taoism are found to be characterized, with some differ- ences of course, by a fatalistic acceptance of innocent suffering as inevitable and incapable of rational explanation. Rowley is distinctly unimpressed by the famous Taoist version of the Golden Rule, referring in this connection to his own book, The Chinese Sages and the Golden Rule (1940). The Moslem idea of qismat is more sympathetically treated. It is not, Rowley shows, blind fate but divine sovereignty, though the former has been known in late Moslem thought. One is surprised that Rowley does not mention the basic meaning of the very word Islam. That Moslem submission is relig- ious - rather than philosophical - in nature and motive is however shown. Teleological explanations of suffering which involve no assumption of the sufferer's guilt are treated next. Passages from the Old and New Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the rabbinic literature are cited. The Servant of the Second Isaiah and the example of Jesus himself are of course the supreme instances, though something closely related to them is recognized in Mo-tzi. In these cases active devotion to the Will of God takes the place of passive submission. Rowley sees in Lk 2242 "not a cry of resignation to suffering, but a cry of consecration to service." The idea of the New Testament that Christ's suffering may be shared by his followers is noted, and related conceptions in Judaism are pointed out. The discussion ends with the observation that the causes of suffering are many and not always explicable, but it may always be met in a spirit of consecration, which "can turn all life into a high adventure in the service of God." MILLAR BURROWS In the Steps of Moses, by Louis Golding. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1943, pp. 556, 16 photographs, maps, $2.50. Louis Golding is best known as a distinguished English novelist and essay- ist. Here he has produced a work which combines travel and fiction, with more than a dash of scholarship and a high regard for tradition. It is a difficult 202</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS book to classify according to the usual rubrics, since it includes history, biblical criticism, legend, travel, adventure. The author made the journey from the Nile through the Sinai Peninsula to Transjordan, following the trail of the Exodus, "in the steps of Moses." He has obviously also read assiduously in preparation for this Odyssey. Into the story he has woven the account of his own pilgrimage and has drawn upon Philo, Josephus, and the Talmud, and upon his own superb imagination as well as upon his memory of much Jewish lore learned from his father, to produce a narrative fascinatingly interesting and eminently worth reading. In pursuing his investigation of the journey of Moses he determines at the outset not to attempt a "variorum journey" - "not, for instance, to go to any Mount Sinai on the further side of Akaba... seeing the traditional mountain has as much truth and poetry as we hoped for." Though the reader knows that the author is well acquainted with the find- ings of archaeology and modern biblical scholarship, he often finds these sources discounted as too sterile for the creation of a living tale; and it is re-creation, not mere research and discovery, that Golding undertakes and achieves. The Jewish Publication Society has done well to make available to American readers this author's own condensation of two earlier volumes on Moses, the Lawgiver and the Conqueror. JOHN W. FLIGHT. The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch, by Charles T. Fritsch. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1943, pp. VII+82, $2.00. Generally speaking, anthropomorphism is characteristic of a primitive age, while anti-anthropomorphism is peculiar to a late and sophisticated age. Hence the tendency to the latter is not confined to the Alexandrian version of the Pentateuch, but extends to all translations of the Bible, notably the Aramaic. One is inclined therefore to ascribe this tendency to anti-anthropo- morphism not alone to the influence of Greek philosophy or Philonic theos- ophy, as our author seems to think, but also, with Frankel and Freudenthal, to inner-Jewish influences. Anyone familiar with the post-biblical literature of the Tannaim and Amoraim is aware that not only Alexandrian, but also Palestinian and Babylonian Jewries were opposed to anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms in the Bible and endeavored to tone them down by various ways and means. The author, it is true, differentiates between the anti- 203</page></plain_text>
