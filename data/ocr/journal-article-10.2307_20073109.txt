<plain_text><page sequence="1">Courbet Paris, New York, Montpellier by CHRISTOPHER RIOPELLE National Gallery, London there has been a marked renewal of schol arly interest in Gustave Courbet in the last fifteen years or so. The revival was spurred by Petra ten-Doesschate Chu's edition of the Letters in 1992 which made available an important new body of primary documents, expertly assembled and annotated.1 Exhi bitions followed on diverse aspects of the artist's life and work, including explorations of his skills at self-promotion; his politics; his relationship to a major patron; and his achievements, unjusdy overlooked, as a painter of landscape.2 Book-length studies have also appeared, including Chu's analysis of Courbet's manipulation of the newly pow erful popular media in nineteenth-century France.3 Linda Nochlin has assembled forty or more years' worth of essays tracing her evolving engagement with the artist.4 S?g ol?ne le Men has now provided a detailed monograph grounded in the history of the period,5 while the long-time Courbet schol ar Sarah Faunce is preparing a new catalogue raisonn?. All this activity confirms the artist's status, more imposing than ever, as a central figure in French art of the nineteenth cent ury. The current, large-scale retrospective exhibition, already seen in Paris, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (to 18th May),6 and to be shown, in a reduced version, at the Mus?e Fabre, Montpellier, is a synthesis of this recent work and an update on our thinking about Courbet since the last major retrospective in Paris and London thirty years ago.7 It should be a spur to research in years to come as well; as with those artists we find most inscrutable and engaging, our questions about Courbet are far from exhausted.

In Courbet's case, his major works are on more-or-less perma nent view in the museums of Paris without evidence of exceptional popular interest. Nonetheless, the exhibition that opened at the Grand Palais in October, where the present reviewer saw it, almost at once caught the imagination of the French public and became one of the most notable successes of recent years at that venue. Perhaps it was the exhi bition poster that caught the eye; ubiquitous on Paris streets and in the M?tro, it showed a recent, dramatic rediscovery, the artist's Self portrait as a desperate man, with its mesmerising, staring eyes (cat. no.6; Fig.67). Perhaps it was word of the remarkable first room of the exhibition, filled with some eighteen no less-arresting self-portraits, each exploring a different aspect of a proud, passionate, hand some, supremely self-assured artist hard at work engineering his own cult of personality. In an age of thrusting art-world careerism such as our own, Courbet came across here as very much a contemporary. More than that, in the words of the literary critic Leon Weiseltier, Courbet offers us 'the sight, no, the spectacle, of a perfecdy free man',8 and in these uncertain times something of his fearlessness proved deeply appealing to modern sensibilities. That first room of self-portraits, in which the young Courbet reconfigures himself over and again in guises from medieval troubadour to Renaissance prince, from peasant and musician to painter and lover, could not have been more effective in estabfishing force of personality as the motor driving his art. To know the art is to engage with the man and with the exhibition that unfolds amplifies and rings a hundred variations on the theme. The next section, dedicated to portraits of family and friends, establishes Courbet as a man grounded in personal relationships in his native Franche Comt? and the town of his birth, Omans.

Portrait of HJ. van Wisselingh, by Gustave Courbet. 1846. Panel, 57.2 by 46 cm. (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth; exh. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). deeply felt connection with that land and its customs is hinted at in a tentative early work of about 1846-47 (Curtis Galleries, Minneapolis; no.23) where the artist's three sisters listen attentively to the local tales of la grand-m?re Sal van, an old lady of nearby Flagey; thus was lore passed and preserved from generation to gener ation. Courbet would enlist picture-making in the same age-old processes and, as his artistic ambitions grew, so too did the complexity of his response to local ways of Life, as in After dinner at Omans (Palais des Beaux-Arts, Lille; no.4.1) and the still enigmatic The preparation of the dead girl (Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton MA; no.43). That Courbet had observed such events in the lives of those with whom he was most familiar was reason enough, in a mind untrammelled by conven tion, to elevate it to high art. That he was so deeply du terroir ensured, from the beginning, the originality of his work. It guaranteed as well that the lure of success always found a counterweight in his imagination in the rich soil from which he sprang. Launched on his career in Paris, Courbet used portraiture as a means of scrutinising the new friendships he formed there among musicians, writers and critics of the vie de Boh?me. Here too, however, he often found it useful to situate his sitters on native ground in order to assess them. The art dealer HJ. van Wisselingh was an early champion, promising to open up the Dutch market to Courbet's work, and arranging for the artist to travel to Amsterdam where he painted Van Wis selingh's brooding portrait in 1846 (no.32; Fig.68). In Holland, not surprisingly, Courbet saw Van Wisselingh in the light of Rembrandt and the seventeenth-century masters of bour geois realism, for whom he felt an instinctive sympathy. This was whence Van Wisselingh came and what, in Courbet's mind, could begin to explain him. As the catalogue notes, not only does the chiaroscuro in the portrait resemble that of Rembrandt's self-portraits, but the dealer's head has the same quizzical twist to it that the Dutch master gave to his depictions of Christ. In further emulation of Dutch practice, Courbet painted the portrait on a wood panel but, always keen to explore novel pictorial effects, he turned the panel over, working on its roughly planed reverse and using the grainy surface to accentuate the flickering play of light. Similarly, the most compelling of his many portraits of his patron, Alfred Bruyas, was painted not on neutral ground in Paris, but in the flat, dry countryside around Montpellier where, in the famous Bonjour Monsieur Courbet (Mus?e Fabre, Mont pellier; no.71), he greets the artist who has come from Omans to seek him out at home. The great 'manifesto' paintings followed, works by which, around 1850, Courbet imposed his presence on the Paris art world. Neither Burial at Omans of 1849-50 nor The studio of 1855 (both Mus?e d'Orsay, Paris) have travelled to New York, so large and fragile are they and, in the case of the latter, in need of a conservation campaign now underway ? nor were they shown in the London exhibition of 1978 - but these monu mental canvases and the works related to them stood at the centre of the Paris showing. Here, still a young man, Courbet defined the Realist principles of his art in complex, multi-figure compositions on a monumental scale. He understood the importance of working on such a scale in order to lay claim to artistic greatness, however presumptuous so early in a budding career; by emulating this strategy, Georges Seurat proved to be Courbet's natural successor some thirty years later. At this point, the organisers of the show have introduced something of an innovation, the display in the exhibition of (beguilingly beautiful) contemporary photographs broadly related to the themes of the paintings. In the case of the Burial they consisted of images of labourers photographed by Adalbert Cuvilier in the 1850s; in the case of the Studio, of portrait photos of personalities such as Baude laire who figured in Courbet's Parisian milieu and appear in the painting. Photographs are particularly effective in the landscape section of the exhibition, showing a shared landscape vision in the mid-nineteenth century united by precision and atmospheric richness.9 The photographs do more, however, than validate Courbet's Realism ex post facto. Rather, in 1851 Louis de Geofroy had insisted that what we looked for in Courbet was 'uneparfaite exactitude9.10 At that moment in history, the photograph was the thrilling new standard by which such verisimilitude could be judged, and the photographs here gave us something by which to evaluate Courbet's success much as Courbet himself might have assessed it. Nearly two thirds of Courbet's production consisted of landscapes, and while the exhi bition does not adhere to anything like that proportion in its judicious selection of works, nonetheless the artist emerges here as an endlessly inventive master of the genre in both large and small formats. His astonishing seascapes - Manet called him 'the Raphael of water' - remain unparalleled as a catalogue of the endlessly shifting moods and conditions of the sea (Fig. 69). Palette knife flashing across canvas, detail sacrificed in the interests of broad general effects, landscapes could be produced relatively quickly in front of the motif or after wards in the studio.

Hesitant bourgeois collectors, anxious to have a piece of an artistic brand name but not quite up for intertwined lesbian lovers, could always start with a sous-bois forest scene, stag darting out of the frame with tail erect. But it is this aspect of Courbet's produc tion that is in some ways the most contested among scholars today. A case in point is the large-scale Gust of wind of 1856, recently acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Hous ton. It is not included here and dismissed as exhibiting residual traces of Th?odore Rousseau-like anthropomorphism and senti mentality. Linda Nochlin, for her part, could hardly bear to look at the 'meaningless [. . .] hodgepodge'.11 I find it one of the artist's most arresting and vibrant landscapes, a self consciously bravura performance in which Courbet threw at the canvas everything he knew about landscape effects. He was frankly out to impress and knew that a dash of vulgar ity was a sign of life. Beautifully preserved, it is, moreover, a more interesting physical object, by far, than the sadly flattened The oak ofFlagey of 1864 (Murauchi Art Museum, Tokyo; no.82) shown here, which, because as an image it is so richly implicated in ancient French history, has acquired a patina of intellectual respectability that the Houston painting cannot claim. And yet there is a sense that we are not taking Courbet at his worth as he himself saw it. The chance the exhibition gives to view once again the astonishing Death of the hunted stag of 1867 (Mus?e des Beaux-Arts, Besan?on; no.22), serves to remind us, on a monumental scale, of this no-holds-barred aspect of Courbet's production. In his recent monograph on Degas, Werner Hofmann argues that Courbet's Realism is the key to understanding the inscrutable aspects of the younger artist's work, his refusal of easy meaning.12 If Degas's life-long concern was the depiction of women, then Courbet's depictions of the female, the nude particularly, that come near the end of the exhibition show how various and passionate Courbet's response had been, and how ambiguous. (Nude photographs, some frankly erotic, show how pervasive such imagery was becoming.) Bodily display is matched by personal reti cence, a refusal to engage with the viewer as his models inhabit a private world of reverie and emotional detachment, their voluptuous ness matched by a kind of reticence. And yet that preservation of individual dignity stands in opposition to the artist's claim to the right of unsquinting exploration of female flesh as his eye moves without scruple or pudeur across its hills and valleys and into secret recesses. This anatomisation culminates in the famous Origin of the world of about 1866 (Mus?e d'Orsay, Paris), Laurence des Cars's analysis of which in the present catalogue is a model of scholarly tact. But it is with the world of the melancholy hunter trudging through snow in the pursuit of game that the exhibition ends. In his quest he is perhaps a projection of the artist himself, pitted against recalcitrant nature but pressing on. But then so too is he the hunter's target, the stag brought down by dogs, the trout dragged onto dry land and gasping for air. Courbet had it both ways; it is a mark of his contemporaneity. How satisfying to have him presented so fully and variously here in an excellent exhibition that reminds us what a commanding figure he is, at the heart of our most pressing aesthetic concerns. 1 P.D.
