<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism: Ibn al-Jawzi's Kitib Akhbar as-Sifdt: A Critical Edition of the Arabic Text. By MERLIN SWARTZ. Islamic Philosophy, Theology, and Science: Texts and Studies, no. 46. Leiden: BRILL, 2002. Pp. 297 + 107. Brill has over the years produced many handsome volumes in Islamic Studies, including some of the most important reference works, editions, and studies in the field. It is a shame, therefore, that the process of editing and review for Brill's many series is not more rigorous. In the reviewer's opinion, the editors (H. Daiber and D. Pingree) of this series do not deserve the title, for it appears that they have not done any actual editing. While a great deal of time and effort have obviously gone into the production of Swartz's edition of this text by Ibn al-Jawzi, the translation, representing the bulk of the work under review, is seriously flawed and should have been thoroughly corrected and revised before publication. This having been said, Swartz deserves credit for making this unpublished critique of the anthropomorphic interpretation of scriptural texts available and for bringing out its importance in Islamic intellectual history. Swartz's informative introduction to the work includes a biographical sketch of Ibn al-Jawzi, a discussion of the authorship of the work and its date of composition, a presentation of the argument of Kitab Akhbar al-Sifidt, and a description of the manuscript used to edit the text. In addition to the edition and translation of the text, each with its own indices, Swartz provides the translation of a trea- tise by the Hanbali jurist al-'Althi which sets out to refute Ibn al-Jawzi's attack on anthropomorphic interpretation. The edition of Ibn al-Jawzi's text is based on a unicum, MS 1561 in the ?ehid Ali Papa collection of the Sfileimaniye Library, Istanbul. While the title Kitab akhbar al-sifit is given on the title page of the manuscript, it does not appear in bibliographies of Ibn al-Jawzi, and attempts to iden- tify it with other titles are not conclusive. The work is closely related to the published work Daf' shubhat al-tashbih wa'l-radd 'ala al-mujassimah, published in Damascus in 1926, which would seem to be an abridged version of the Kitdb akhbar al-sifait. Swartz argues that Kitab akhbhr al-sifat was composed sometime in the 580s (between 1185 and 1192) and represented Ibn al-Jawzi's mature views, at a time when he had already begun to fall afoul of his opponents in the traditionalist wing of the Hanbali madhhab, but before his exile to Wasit in southern Iraq in 590/1193. The work shows him to be drawing on predecessors within the lHanbali madhhab, such as Ibn CAqil (d. 513/1119), in order to right what he considered a terrible failing on the part of fellow Hanbalis: the interpretation of scriptural references to God, in both the Qur'an and hadith, in a grossly anthropomorphic manner. Ibn al- Jawzi provides a catalogue of Qur'anic verses and hadith reports that have been interpreted in this way by earlier authorities, chief among whom are the figures Ibn HImid (d. 403/1013), AbNi Ya'la (d. 458/1066), and Ibn Zaghtini (d. 525/1132). He criticizes these interpretations and provides alternative interpretations that avoid anthropomorphism. In doing so, he proposes a theory of ta-wil or figurative interpretation that draws on AshCari and Mu'ta- zili theology, including the theories of such scholars as al-Baqillani (d. 403/1013), Ibn Flirak (d. 406/ 1015), and al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1038). It is this that makes his work appear unusual, particularly coming from a .Hanbali jurist. He has rather harsh assessments of his fellow Hanbalis, whom he char- acterizes in several passages as being beyond the pale of true Islam. One comes away from Swartz's</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 617 study with an understanding that the Hanbali madhhab was not ideologically monolithic; far from it, the debate over anthropomorphism was raging in Ibn al-Jawzi's day, with tempers heated on all sides. The translation is marred, in my view, first by excessive footnotes and transcribed Arabic text in parentheses. In most cases, the notes are much longer than necessary, and many points made there could be included in the introductory study or omitted altogether. The transcribed Arabic text seems almost entirely superfluous, because the language and constructions used are not overly obscure and above all because the inquisitive reader need merely consult the accompanying Arabic edition of the text. Much more importantly, the translation contains many serious errors and misunderstandings of the text. In the opening prayer, the Prophet is described as al-walid ash-shafiq, "the compassionate father," but the translation reads "giver of sincere counsel" (p. 78). The phrase bi-kawnifi'li 1-mukallafi ha- sanan wa-nadban wa-mujzi'an wa-ghayra mujzi' is translated "whether the actions of a responsible adult (mukallaf) are good or bad, allowed or prohibited" (p. 81), when it means, "whether the actions ... are good or recommended, fulfill an obligation or do not fulfill it." A sentence in the translation reads, "This conclusion... explains why it is that.. ." (p. 83), when the text it is meant to render states, "This conclusion ... is demonstrated by the fact that .. ." A hadith reportedly fabricated by Mu- hammad b. Shujad al-Balkhi in order to slander the traditionists states that God created a horse out of a certain liquid, then caused it to run so that it would perspire, then created His own substance from the perspiration. Swartz understands the phrase referring to this liquid as min mu'in min darrin "out of water that flows copiously" or, less likely, min mda'i man darra "out of the water of him who runs swiftly" (p. 88, n. 51). The correct form is probably min ma'in min durr "out of a liquid made of pearls." To correct all the translation errors in the book would be a formidable task. Many of these errors result from confusion of pronominal antecedents, admittedly difficult in a dialectic text such as this, or from misunderstanding of the logical connection between sentences. I present two paragraphs as examples, followed by my own translations. The Creator of the universe must be an existent (mawjiid), for existence and non-existence are polar opposites (mutaqabilan) between which there is no intermediate mode of being (wasita). Since it has been established that things must have a cause (fd'il), it is necessary that it be both existent (mawjud) and eternal (qadim), for a [first] cause must be antecedent to what is caused, necessary to its existence, and without beginning, for if it had a beginning in time it would itself require a cause (muhdith) and thus for a regressus ad infinitum (tasalsul). Since [God] is eter- nally existent, non-being may not be predicated of Him, for He whose eternal pre-existence (qidam) is established cannot be conceived as non-existent. If His non-existence were possible, He would be dependent on a cause. However, He is one whose existence is uncaused, hence there can be no cause for His non- existence. (pp. 84-85) This should read as follows: The Creator of the universe exists, for existence and non-existence are opposites between which there is no middle term. Since it has been established that He causes things, one must necessarily conclude that He exists. He-glory be to Him-is also pre-eternal, because the agent precedes that which is done. He is necessarily existent, without a beginning to his existence, because, had He been contingent, He would have required an originator, and this would lead to an infinite re- gression. He is also everlasting and cannot cease to exist, because it is impossible for something to become non-existent when its pre-eternal existence has been established. If His non-existence were possible, then it would be dependent on a cause, but there cannot be a cause for the non- existence of One whose existence is uncaused. Some of the changes I have made here, one might say, are cosmetic, but Swartz's translation has many issues of substance simply wrong. Swartz has misunderstood the antecedents of a number of pro- nouns to refer to things when they refer to God, and vice-versa. A number of sentences have been di- vided incorrectly, thereby confusing the logic and structure of the passage. The passage is structured to prove three points about God in an ordered manner: (1) that He exists; (2) that He is pre-eternal; and (3) that He is post-eternal. Swartz's translation obscures this structure, particularly in the sentence</page><page sequence="3">618 Journal of the American Oriental Society 124.3 (2004) "Since [God] is eternally existent, ... ." This is the beginning of the third section, meant to demonstrate that He is post-eternal, rather than assuming it. The following paragraph is similarly misconstrued: The divine attributes (sifat) we establish only on the basis of evidence of a peremptory nature (dalil maqtti' bihi), that is [the evidence of] the Book of God and those Prophetic Traditions that have come down to us through multiple chains of authority (hadith mutawatir) on the basis of whose transmission the Community (al-jamd'a)-one which cannot agree in regard to what is false (kidhb)-has established a consensus. Moreover, the consensus (ijma~) of the Commu- nity too is based on evidence of a peremptory nature, viz., the evidence of reason (dalil al-'aql), for [reason] is a safeguard against the possibility [of ascribing to] the Creator what is not pos- sible to [ascribe to] Him. (p. 91) This should read as follows: God-glory be to Him-has attributes which we have established through evidence known with assurance. This evidence derives from the Book of God the Exalted, widespread oral reports from the Messenger of God-may God bless him and grant him peace-which have been col- lectively transmitted by a group that cannot possibly collude in a lie, the consensus of the Com- munity based on evidence they know with assurance, and the evidence of reason; for reason precludes that something which cannot possibly apply to any causative agent could possibly apply to Him. In this paragraph, Ibn al-Jawzi lists four types of evidence he considers admissible for the proof of theological points-the list has obvious connections with the science of jurisprudence (usil al-fiqh) and should look familiar. Swartz has reduced these types of evidence to three, by mixing together widely-transmitted reports form the Prophet and consensus on the one hand, and consensus and reason on the other. The resulting translation changes the intended meaning of the original text quite a bit. The Arabic text is edited carefully, with full recording of variants, parallel texts in other works, and marks and ambiguities in the text, such as missing points on letters. Paragraphs have been set off and numbered for easy reference. I suggest here a number of corrections and emendations, some of which are merely incorrect vowelings and do not affect the meaning significantly, but others of which require that the translation be changed considerably. For example, Swartz translates part of the opening bless- ing as follows: "We give praise that His branch (far'uhu) endures [reading mustamirr] and that His root (asluhu) is possessed of rich foliage."(p. 78). This should read, "We praise [God] in a manner whose branch bears fruit [muthmir] and whose stem produces rich foliage." In a passage describing God's bounty by using the example of the growth and harvest of grain, Swartz translates, "Anyone who observes the coming of the rain at the time of planting and its cessation as the grain ripens, fol- lowed by the arrival of the autumn winds [reading al-riydhu 'l-badriyatu] and the sun's drawing near so as to dry the grain and prepare it for storage ..." (pp. 83-84). This should read ". .. then that the winds are loosed to winnow it [al-riyah li-tadhriyahu] and the sun is brought near so that the grain dries and can be stored." In another passage, Ibn al-Jawzi cites the hadith report, "He who comes to Me walking, I will come to him running," observing that some scholars consider it to be based on a comparison with the running (harwalah) of camels (an'dm). Swartz's translation calls it "a figure of speech referring to God's bestowal of blessings [reading in'am] on His creatures" (p. 128).

The translation, however, has more serious failings, and many of its paragraphs are simply unreliable. DEVIN J. STEWART EMORY UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
