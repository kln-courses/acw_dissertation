<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR: RAMONIAN AESTHETICS IN THE EARLY WORK OF LUIS BUNUEL LuIs Cernuda, author of several essays on G6mez de la Serna, once identified Ram6n as "el tiltimo gran escritor espafiol descendiente en rango e importan- cia de nuestros grandes clhisicos" (169), adding that his work "por si sola equi- vale a la de toda una generaci6n literaria, a toda una 6poca de nuestra literatu- ra" (177). Similar opinions have been expressed by many of the century's most respected intellectual voices, among them Octavio Paz who wrote that "Para mi es el gran escritor espafiol: el Escritor o, mejor, la Escritura. [...] Hubo un mo- mento en que la modernidad habl6 por la boca de G6mez de la Serna" (186- 87). Despite such prestigious votes of approval, however, Ram6n continues to be the recipient of notoriously scant critical attention. Among the many facets of his voluminous literary output which have yet to be satisfactorily explored is the consideration of possible ramonian influences on the work of his literary contemporaries. This lacuna is, in part, comprehensible: while few, for example, would deny the role of ramonian aesthetics in the poetic development of many members of the Generation of 1927, quantification of that influence has proven ex- tremely difficult. To echo Dimaso Alonso's appraisal of surrealism, one might say that Ram6n, quite simply, "estaba en el aire" in the Madrid of the 1910's and 1920's - utterly inescapable, arguably necessary, yet at the same time al- most impossible to track. There are, however, exceptions: for certain young artists Ram6n not only served as a source of apparently inextinguishable avant- garde enthusiasm, but also as a literary mentor whose aesthetic determinations profoundly and identifiably influenced the development of the disciple's avant-garde thought. In the following, I would like to consider one such rela- tionship: that which developed in the early 1920's between Ram6n and a young university student who was later to become one of Spain's most celebrat- ed avant-garde figures, Luis Bufiuel. 2 See, in general, Cernuda's "G6mez de la Serna y la generaci6n poitica del 1925." Regarding the possible presence of ramonian aesthetics in the work of Garcia Lorca, see R. L. Jackson, "La presencia de la gregueria en la obra de Garcia Lorca," Hispan6fila 25 (1965): 51-55. 2 I initially considered the ramonian influence on Bufiuel's early artistic production in a 1989 article entitled "Context as Instability: Aspects of Object Presentation in Luis Bufiuel's Avant-Garde Works." That study, which centers on the chaotic enumeration of objects in bufiuelian works, contains an abbreviated discussion of Bufuel's use of the Rastro aesthetic. In order to minimize repetition, I have, in the present article, chosen to limit my comments on the Rastro aesthetic, focusing instead on other aspects of Ram6n's relationship with Bufiuel. Those interested in more detailed discussion of Bufiuel's use of the Rastro model - clearly a key component of the bufiluelian avant-garde vision - may consult my earlier article in Selected Proceedings of the Tenth Louisiana Conference on Hispanic Languages and Literatures (New Orleans: Tulane University, 1989): 257-67.</page><page sequence="2">354 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) There is little argument about the existence of a strong ramonian influ- ence on Bufiuel's artistic production. As the director himself has noted in nu- merous interviews and autobiographical writings, he and Ram6n became close personal friends during the 1920's. 3 Throughout virtually his entire university career (1917-1925), Bufiluel was a regular member of the legendary tertulia in Pombo, and it was there that he became familiarized with Ram6n's aesthetic formulations and where an increasingly intimate friendship and artistic rela- tionship developed between the two. Favorable references to his mentor are included in several of Bufiuel's early works of film criticism, 4 and in fact, the two even collaborated on a film project in 1927-1928. Unfortunately, Ram6n's delays in mailing Bufiluel the final version of the script, coupled with an invi- tation from Salvador Dalf that Bufiluel spend Christmas at Dali's home in Cadaquds, put an end to this planned collaboration: during Bufiuel's stay in Cadaquds, he and Dalf developed the screenplay for the film which, five months later, would debut in Paris as Un chien andalou. The ramonian film project, at that point, was definitively abandoned, although Ram6n eventually published a series of vignettes from the screenplay under the title Chiffres in the French film journal, La Revue du Cinima. 6 See, e.g., his autobiography, Mon dernier soupir (91). 4 See "Del plano fotog6nico" and "Dama de las camelias," both originally published in La Gaceta Literaria in 1927 and reprinted in A. S&amp;inchez Vidal's edition of Bufiuel's Obra literaria. 5 Bufiuel spent two weeks at Dali's home in Cadaquis inJanuary 1929. Aranda cites two letters to Pepin Bello, one written immediately before, the other immediately after, his visit. In the first, Bufiuel wrote from Paris: "Mafiana o pasado me voy a pasar quince dias a casa de Dalf para trabajar en colaboraci6n en unas ideas comunes y muy cine- matogrnificas" (75). On Feb. 10, after excusing himself for writing to no one during his stay with Dalf, he declares exultantly: "Con Dali, mis unidos que nunca, hemos trabaja- do en intima colaboraci6n para fabricar un scinario estupendo, sin antecedentes en la historia del cine. Es algo gordo" (75). In Mon dernier soupir, Bufiuel recalls the decision to create Un chien andalou as follows: "En arrivant chez Dali, a Figueras, invite f passer quelquesjours,je lui racontai quej'avais rav6, peu de temps auparavant, d'un nuage ef- file coupant la lune et d'une lame de rasoir rendant un oeil. De son c6td il me raconta qu'il venait de voir en rave, la nuit prdc~dente, une main pleine de fourmis. II ajouta: 'Et si nous faisions un film, en partant de Ca?' " (125). 6 The course of the ultimately unsuccessful Bufiuel/G6mez de la Serna film collab- oration can be traced, with considerable detail, via Bufiluel's contemporary correspon- dence. In a July 1927 letter to Le6n Sfnchez Cuesta, for example, Buiiuel already ex- presses impatience at what he views as unnecessary delays in the completion of the screenplay: "Si ve a Ram6n ent~rese diplomiticamente si me esti haciendo el argumen- to. Acept6 cuando le propuse esto, en el mes de mayo; despuds le he escrito y, como siempre que espero algo interesante, no me ha contestado" (Obra literaria. 23). Little had changed as of March 21, 1928, when he wrote to Pepin Bello: "Ram6n jasin no me ha enviado su argumento! Ya recordarfs que trabajamos juntos en Madrid y que lo dimos por terminado" (Aranda 50). Bufiluel refers to his work on the gui6n in both Mon dernier soupir (124-25) and in Prohibido asomarse al interior where he adds that he actually met with Ram6n twice to work on the script (21). It is unknown whether the screenplay was ever completed, though Bufiuel's contemporary correspondence seems to suggest that it was. In fact, by August 1928 Bufiuel was speaking confidently of the film's immi- nent production: "Estoy haciendo el dicoupage de mi pr6ximo film Caprichos, sobre un escenario de Ram6n. El film se compone de seis cuentos. Comienza la realizaci6n en septiembre u octubre, en sociedad con una firma de Paris. Tengo en mi cuenta co- rriente 25.000 pesetas destinadas al film Caprichos. (Aug. 1, 1928 letter to Pepin Bello,</page><page sequence="3">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 355 Though their personal relationship lapsed following the civil war, Bufinuel throughout his life openly and repeatedly recognized the enormity of his debt to his youthful mentor, and the great admiration he felt for Ram6n never fal- tered. As if in answer to Cernuda's criticism that "se ha hablado mucho, acaso demasiado, acerca de la influencia de tal o cual poeta de la generaci6n del 98 sobre estos otros de la generaci6n de 1925, pero que yo sepa nada se dijo acer- ca de la influencia sobre ellos de G6mez de la Serna" (177), Bufiuel set the record clear about his personal opinion during the preparation of Max Aub's Conversaciones con Buiiuel: "Ram6n ha sido," he told Aub, "el hombre que mis ha influido en toda nuestra generaci6n" (109). With regard to Bufiuel's own artistic production, that influence is easily identified. Indeed, several of Bufiuel's early prose texts appear to have been drawn directly from earlier ramonian narratives. "Por que no uso un reloj" (1923), to cite but one example, seems to have been modeled on Ram6n's "El hombre que no podia dar cuerda al reloj" (Gollerias 151-52). In other early bufiuelian works, Ram6n's presence is no less evident. The following quota- tions, all taken from texts written during the early 1920's, may serve as examples of the numerous ramonian echoes which pepper Bufiuel's literary production: "Una traici6n incalificable" (1922) -"el viento es el gato de los papeles." "Instrumentaci6n" (1923) -"Flautin: Hormiguero del sonido." -"Platillos: Luz hecha afiicos." "Teorema" (1925) -"Todas las ventanas tienen pestafias como mujeres."8 The essential components of the gregueria (humor, metaphor, surprise, brevi- ty and, of course, Ram6n's ubiquitous cosas) are all clearly present in these pas- sages. As I have discussed elsewhere, the chaotic mixing of disparate objects characteristic of Ram6n's so-called "Rastro aesthetic" is also central to many of Bufiuel' texts, including "Una traici6n incalificable" (1922), "Suburbios: Mo- tivos" (1923), and "Diluvio" (1926), as well as numerous bufiuelian films in- cluding Un chien andalou and L'age d'or. Indeed, even some of Bufiuel's most memorable cinematic images arguably derive at least some of their inspiration from the writings of G6mez de la cited in Aranda 50-51). Although generally identified as Caprichos, Bufiuel at times gives the film's title as El mundo por diez cdntimos, indicating that the ramonian vignettes were to be presented as though each was a story from the front page of a Madrid newspaper (see, e.g., Prohibido asomarse al interior 21). The ten vignettes which Ram6n published in La Revue du Cinima in 1930 under the title Chiffres almost were almost certainly initially destined for the film project - although, as stated above, Bufiluel appears to have want- ed only six vignettes to appear in the final version of the film. 7 Similar manipulations of lineal time occur in other early ramonian texts includ- ing "El novelista" (see, e.g., page 11). 8 These literary works, many of which were published in literary journals during the 1920's, are all reprinted in Sainchez Vidal's edition of Bufiuel's Obra literaria. 9 See my aforementioned article, "Context as Instability: Aspects of Object Presenta- tion in Luis Bufiuel's Avant-Garde Works." Bibliographic information is given in note 1.</page><page sequence="4">356 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) Serna. The following passage from Ram6n's "Fragmentos de un diario aborta- do" (1922), for example, appears distinctly reminiscent of the epilogue of Un chien andalou: Lo mais triste de mi muerte es que se apagarni en mi la tierra por comple- to... iQud se encendeni entonces el cielo? No. Seria demasiado mon6tono estar siempre, sin poderse levantar nunca, en la arena de la playa mirando el cruel vacio de los cielos. (112-13) Elsewhere, one finds in Ram6n's early texts numerous disturbing references to other well-known bufiuelian topoi including graphic deoculation: one thinks, for example, of the gruesome image of the glass eye of Corpus's dying lover squirting from its socket and shattering a mirror in El novelista. In a similar vein, Ram6n includes in Gregueri'as selectas (1919) the following description of the incomparable efficacity of the razor blade as an image of terror: Pasando la navaja por el suavizador se siente el miedo inverosimil de que se nos escape el brazo y nos cercenemos por el pecho, biselindonos. El miedo a la navaja de afeitar y a sus facultades, de una eficacia inmensa, no tiene parecido. (34) In reading through G6mez de la Serna's early literary production, in short, one can hardly refrain from concluding that Luis Buiuel learned the lessons of Pombo extremely well. G6mez de la Serna's presence in Bufiuel's artistic production, however, goes far beyond mere textual echo. I would like to begin my discussion of the broader ramifications of the ramonian role in the development of Builuel's aesthetic vision with a brief consideration of Bufiuel's first published literary work, "Una traici6n incalificable," which appeared in the Ultraist journal Ultra in November 1922. Borrowing an image from "Fragmentos de un diario abor- tado" (published earlier the same year) in which Ram6n complains "Me ha apenado este viento de hoy, porque se ha llevado los frutos casi ingrividos de mi pensamiento" (Variaciones 111), Bufiluel in "Traici6n" recounts the misad- venture of an author who one day opens the window to his study, only to find that the wind promptly blows the "miles de cuartillas" which make up his self- proclaimed literary masterpiece out of the window, where they disappear dis- persed like gaviotas across the horizon. The text begins with the words: "Hacia ya un afio que trabajaba en mi obra, en mi gran obra." The double italicization of the word mi in this passage, clear- ly the sentence's most eye-catching characteristic, reappears at intervals throughout the body of the narrative which follows: 10 According to an attending nurse, during the final phases of the woman's agony, the eye "se escap6 a su 6rbita contraida con tal fuerza, que se rompi6 contra su propia imagen en el espejo del cuarto" (250). Images of eye mutilation appear in various other ramonian texts, including a vignette in his screenplay, Chiffres, entitled "Celui qui mangea un oeil de poisson." See also Variaciones 113, El Rastro 121, and Disparates 162.</page><page sequence="5">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 357 [...] me traeria toda clase de perfumes y de muisicas y arrullaria mi gran trabajo. Francamente: qued6 amoscado ante su informalidad y poco interns de- mostrado en ojear mi obra [...] Se habia llevado mi obra, mi definitiva obra, que volaba convertida en gaviotas por el horizonte. Agustin Sinchez Vidal, editor of the 1982 edition of Bufiuel's Obra literaria, has suggested that this use of italicization be understood as a "decidida ironizaci6n de la obra ostentosamente individual y el escarnio del t6pico romintico del genio incomprendido en su buhardilla solipsista" (247). There is little reason to doubt the validity of such an interpretation. The idea that the italicized mi's serve as a metaliterary allusion can be supported in several ways within the text itself: the narrator, for example, is a writer, and the possessives are used exclu- sively to modify words relating to his literary profession (obra, gran obra, definiti- va obra and gran trabajo). Sinchez Vidal's further suggestion that the parody's intended victim is the topos of the romantic genie, while not drawn from explicit textual evidence, also appears logical. By opening his first work with a ridi- culization of romanticism's excesses, Buriuel could be accused of nothing more than of adopting a posture which, by 1922, had already become some- thing of a tradition within the European avant-garde and which had been duly repeated in the pages of the numerous Ultraist journals published in Madrid in the early 1920's. Anti-romantic rhetoric is, moreover, frequent in many of Bufiluel's other early writings. I believe that the italicizations in "Una traici6n incalificable" may be relat- ed to another, even more obviously bizarre aspect of the narrative as well: that is, Bufiuel's handling of the distinctively ramonian theme of the relationship between human observer and inanimate matter. In "Traici6n," the text's first- person narrator, though seemingly alone, is, in fact, far from lonely: at work at his desk, he shares the stage with a lively assortment of furnishings with which, it appears, he enjoys an amiable and affective relationship: Los muebles, el parquet y los libros de mi cuarto se complacian al verme trabajar en esta obra genial. Apenas sentado, agrupabanse a mi alrededor la mesa, la libreria y la cama, que chirriaban satisfechas. La libreria sobre todo, se aproximaba mis, de puntillas, y arqueaba sus lomos de libros en actitud expectante. The unabashed anthropomorphization found in this quotation characterizes the presentation of the furniture and other accoutrements mentioned throughout the remainder of the text. It is presented without fanfare: there is no tone of exclamation, no gasp of surprise, no textual indication that there is anything at all unusual about an armchair "abriendo sus cordiales brazos" in anticipation of the weight of its master. Utilizing a straightforward style and tone more generally associated with the narration of "realistic" events, Buiuel weaves a curious and humorous tale in which fantastic, logically inconceivable elements are unceremoniously presented to the reader side by side with the trappings of objective discourse.</page><page sequence="6">358 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) This narrative posture is not limited to "Una traici6n incalificable." Objects with emotions, objects with attitudes, objects, in short, with life reappear re- peatedly throughout the seven texts written by Builuel during his years at the Residencia. "Instrumentaci6n" (1922), his most identifiably gregueristic text, has constant recourse to prosopopeia in its description of orchestral instru- ments ("Contrabajos: Ahora los vemos oscilar y grufiir satisfechos por las cosquillas que les hacen los contrabajistas en la barriga"), and, in an even more extreme example, "Por qu6 no uso reloj" (1925) has time itself appear personified in a strange combination of clock and man "con un desigual bi- gote en forma de saetas y dos minfisculos ojillos, como esos que tienen los relo- jes para darles cuerda." The similarity between the attitude adopted toward the objects described in these bufiuelian texts and that found in ramonian works is, I think, beyond question. Throughout his career, and particularly in works such as El Rastro and the greguerfas, the privileged position afforded to individ- ual - and often thoroughly unremarkable - objects is one of the unmistakable features of Ram6n's entire literary output. The two writers' level of intellectual compenetration on the issue of object anthropomorphization is made particularly apparent by a comparison of Ram6n's statements regarding the autonomy of objects with Bufiuel's 1923 text, "Tragedias inadvertidas como temas de un teatro novisimo." Perhaps the most important of Bufiuel's early literary efforts, "Tragedias" is the only Madrid-era work which contains a theoretical consideration of Bufiuel's view of the aesthetic implications of artistic modernization. Published in Alfar in February 1923, it is an unusual text in which traditional generic lines are blurred as expository writing combines with fictional narrative as a means of addressing the need for innovation in the theatrical arts. Such a premise might not seem to lend itself to experimentations with anthropomorphism; however, in Builuel's hands, this discussion of modern theatre becomes the vehicle by which a new definition of prosopopeia is introduced. In "Tragedias," Bufiluel discusses the need for renovation of the use of pro- sopopeia by emphasizing the insufficiency of attempts which fail to recognize the psychological dimension of inanimate matter. Bufiuel explains the differ- ence between traditional anthropomorphization and his own approach to ob- jects as follows: Es cierto, que muchas veces se hizo hablar algfin objeto desprovisto de vida, pero siempre lo hacen como un ser humano o superan en lirismos al mejor poeta. Existe la expresi6n lirica o filos6fica pero no la psicol6gica innata a ellos: esa tremenda y complicada psicologia ain tan sin estudiar. According to Bufiluel's argument, an author using traditional prosopopeia im- bues inanimate matter with human characteristics in order to achieve a certain poetic mood. The resulting anthropomorphism is, thus, not inherent; that is, the prosopopeia in no way implies that the objects actually possess the human qualities ascribed to them. It is a trope, an act of language, belonging less to the object it describes than to the whim of the author who created it. Bufiuel, on the other hand, will adopt the pose that prosopopeia - at least his pro- sopopeia - is not merely a form of literary creation, but rather an act of ob-</page><page sequence="7">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 359 jective observation. He does not propose to describe inanimate material as though it had human qualities, but rather to recognize and describe phenome- na which, though often passing totally unperceived (the "tragedias inadver- tidas" of the essay's title), actually exist. Bufiuel is firm on this point, stating early in the essay that "lo indudable es que en lo abi6tico existen las pasiones," and again in the text's final sentence: "el caso es que lo afectivo es cualidad de lo inanimado." Buiuel's definition of prosopopeia could, with few variations, easily pass as a page from one of G6mez de la Serna's own works. Ram6n's "Las cosas y 'el ello,' " for example, though published some years later, approaches the ques- tion of prosopopeia in highly similar terms: Es muy importante que hayamos comenzado a saber que hay vida ince- sante y sid6rea en ese extasis de los objetos. Hay que comenzarles a tratar de otra manera [...] Se puede decir que s61o ahora se va a encarar el hom- bre con las cosas, ya sin el fetichismo que las encubria o el desd6n que las dejaba sin sentido (190-91). The two writers coincide on a crucial point: traditional literary anthropomor- phization fails, in their view, precisely because it is always, at its core, a con- firmation of the power of the human will. By openly taking the position that their version of prosopopeia is not aimed at artificially ascribing human quali- ties to things in the name of art but rather at recognizing the existence of those qualities in the name of truth, both Bufiuel and G6mez de la Serna cre- ate literary universes which invalidate standard assumptions regarding the rela- tionship between human observer and the world. In "Las cosas y 'el ello,'" G6mez de la Serna identifies one of the principal reasons for his interest in the portrayal of inanimate life: "Lo que me caracteri- za es la ternura por las cosas que hay en lo mis rec6ndito de mi. Asi como hay el protector de animales, yo soy el protector de las cosas" (191). Likewise, Bufiluel's Obra literaria texts return again and again to the creation of an emo- tional bond between human and thing. In "Tragedias," the narrator recalls: Al entrar yo en mi habitaci6n [el trapo] movia alegre sus bracitos angu- lares y no cesaba de hacerme sefias hasta que le tomaba entre mis manos. Se adheria a ellas tiernamente y comunicaba su dulce calor, con cariflo so- lamente comparable al de una madre que acaricia a su hijo. [...] En fin, tanto 61 como yo, nos cobramos verdadero afecto. (171) Ternura, thus, presents itself as a central element of the new approach to prosopopeia proposed in both authors' texts. Its importance has not gone un- perceived, particularly in studies of G6mez de la Serna's works. Numerous commentarists, and especially those who seek to portray Ram6n as the "Aden sin serpiente" " of modern letters, devote ample space to this aspect of his artistic vision. "11 The characterization of Ram6n as practitioner of an "adamismo sin serpiente" appears inJ. Cam6n Aznar's Ram6n Gdmez de la Serna en sus obras (Madrid: Espasa Calpe, 1972) 39.</page><page sequence="8">360 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) Taken out of context, however, the larger implications of the formulation of an affective response toward inanimate objects may prove misleading: the true importance of affection in these texts does not derive as much from any particular characteristic of the emotional bond between human being and ob- ject as from the utility of that bond as a means of exemplifying the text's fun- damental reordering of the human subject's relationship with the world. In other words, what is fundamentally at issue is not sentiment per se, but the na- ture of the underlying suppositions that make possible the existence of that sentiment. At its heart, the ramonian (and bufiuelian) treatment of objects is not merely a question of ternura, but of albedrio. In both authors' texts, objects are no longer merely passive recipients of human volition: now, one might say, when a human gaze turns upon an object, that gaze is sure to be returned. The negative potential of this "returned gaze" is particularly evident in Bufiuel's work. In "Tragedias inadvertidas como temas de un teatro novisimo," for example, despite the text's humorous facade, the human narrator's contact with self-willed objects ultimately proves to be anything but an enjoyable expe- rience. As the title suggests, the human-object encounters described in the text lead only to tragedy. At times that tragedy befalls the autonomous object itself which, upon showing itself to be capable of thought, action, and emotion, also becomes susceptible to the more somber by-products of the state of self-aware- ness: suffering, loneliness, anguish and mortality. Several vignettes recount the "existential crises" - and, ultimately, death - of several of the various anthropo- morphic objects with which the human narrator comes into contact. In one vi- gnette, for example, the narrator's intimate friendship with a chamois cloth is abruptly cut short when the cloth disappears and is later found hanging dead from a telegraph cable. In another story, the narrator's own pair of pajamas is driven to suicide - "de pronto escuch~ breve gemido en la percha" - upon learning of a fire in the department store where it had been purchased and where many of its friends continued on display. More frequently, however, it is the human component of Bufiuel's narra- tion (whether present only as narrative observer or actual participant) who most visibly suffers as a result of the encounter with animate "inanimate life." One vignette, for example, recounts the tale of an irate pipe which attacks the man attempting to light it, producing severe burns. In another, the human narrator is placed in the humiliating position of having to cater to the whims of a petulant water jug in order to be able to satisfy his thirst. In yet another, a visitor to an attic full of old, broken objects is brought, with a growing sense of horror, face to face with his own mortality. In the text's closing paragraph, Bufiuel goes as far as to suggest that modern writers of tales of terror should realize that the feeling of horror that authors like Edgar Allan Poe once creat- ed through the narration of human encounters with phantoms, monsters, and eerie burial grounds, can, in the modern world, be equalled if not surpassed by the description of human encounters with every-day objects capable of au- tonomous will. The ominous portrayal of object autonomy found in the aforementioned buiiuelian works would seem to contrast with the general impression left by a reading of ramonian treatises on the place of the object in modern literature and in modern life. Ram6n, when writing about his own aesthetic philosophy,</page><page sequence="9">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 361 tended, in general, to stress the optimistic side of his aesthetic enterprise. 12 Nevertheless, it is possible to encounter in some of his works a notably darker vision of the consequences resulting from the recognition of object autonomy. It is these works which, I believe, must have most fascinated Bufiluel. They are certainly the ones which have the most direct bearing on Bufiluel's own artistic production. If one examines, for example, the text of the screenplay on which Bufiuel and Ram6n collaborated in the late 1920's, it is notable to find that each of the ten vignettes which were to make up the film deal, in some way, with questions of mortality. Indeed, despite its brevity, the screenplay describes a total of six deaths, as well as two acts of mutilation. Objects, and in particular the issue of object volition, play a key role. In one scene, for example, a scarecrow decides to abandon his life as an "object" (passive, lifeless) and begin existence as a free man. One of his first acts, upon descending from his post in the field, is to light a cigar, with which he immediately immolates himself. As occurs with the objects in Bufiluel's "Tragedias," the scarecrow's desire to become alive is the direct cause of his death. In other vignettes, in particular "Le souvenir," objects are seen as repositories of horror (thus echoing the conclusion of Bufiluel's "Tragedias"); in still others, including "Le chevalier" and "Le papier d'appel," they are agents of human destruction. "Le papier d'appel" is particularly interesting in this context, inasmuch as it deals with a topic closely related to that found in Bufiuel's "Una traici6n in- calificable." As mentioned above, "Traici6n" 's central image is that of the wind carrying away the pages of the narrator's life work. From the narrator's repeat- ed use of italicized possessives in identifying his lost text, readers may deduce that the destruction of this "definitiva obra" represents more than a profession- al setback: for the narrator, those "miles de cuartillas" have, in a sense, become synonymous with his life. A similar situation arises in "Le papier d'appel:" in this case, the role of the "cuartillas" is played by a letter which, thanks to the gusting of a fortuitous breeze, is able successfully to navigate the streets of Madrid in pursuit of an increasingly alarmed male pedestrian. Finally, the man reads the letter which, it turns out, is from a woman, held captive for twenty years in a Madrid apartment, who pleads for someone to save her life. Unfortu- nately, the woman does not include the address of the building, and bases her hope for rescue on the physical presence of the letter itself, lying on the ground beneath her window. As indicated above, however, the letter does not choose to remain stationary. In its frenzied attempt to be read, it travels far from its initial resting place, thereby not only defeating its own reason for exis- tence but also destroying the woman's sole chance for salvation. Like the nar- rator of "Una traici6n incalificable," the woman must suffer the consequences of having placed her life - literally, textually - onto a printed page which, once 12 In the prologue to his first collection of greguerias, for example, he identifies his characteristic trouvailles as "la flor de todo, lo que queda, lo que vive, lo que surge entre el descreimiento, la acidez y la corrosi6n, lo que resiste todo" [vii]). Elsewhere in the same text, he adds, "La Gregueria es lo finico que no nos pone tristes, cabezones, pe- sarosos y tumefactos al escribirla, pues su autor juega mientras la compone y tira su cabeza i lo alto y despuis la recoge" (xii).</page><page sequence="10">362 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) written, utterly escapes from her control. Though intended as a means of reaf- firming her right to freedom, the letter, by exercising its own freedom, ulti- mately serves as both cause of and testament to her perdition. Although, as the episode of "Le papier d'appel" indicates, it is true that some of the vignettes included in Chiffres resemble texts from the bufuelian literary production, it would be incorrect to assume that the film's more dis- quieting overtones are attributable solely to Bufiluel's contributions to the elab- oration of the screenplay. In fact, a number of the segments (including sever- al particularly grisly episodes) are taken from earlier ramonian narratives. Such is the case, for example, of the second segment, "Et la victime?," drawn directly from "Yo vi matar a aquella mujer" (Disparates 113-14), and "Le cheval vide," drawn from "Reverte I" (Caprichos 87-103). Similarly, the central image of the soldier buried under a fallen chimney, found in the screenplay vignette entitled "Le chevalier," seems to have been inspired by a similar passage in "Las dramiticas chimeneas" (Caprichos 9-41). In reviewing Ram6n's literary output during the 1910's and 1920's, moreover, it becomes clear that these dis- comforting episodes do not represent an anomaly within the ramonian pro- duction. The generally disquieting role played by the objects found in Buiiuel's liter- ary and filmic works finds ample precedent in Ram6n's early texts. One thinks, for example, of "El gancho del plaf6n," in which a sardonic, mocking "gan- cho," installed in the ceiling of the narrator's apartment, so humiliates the man for not being able to afford a suitable chandelier that it drives him to commit suicide by hanging himself from the fateful hook (Disparates 25-26). In "El banco del bien y el mal," a street bench calls out invitingly to passers-by, "Anda, si~ntate un ratito," but those who heed its Sirene-like call immediately slide into moral and/or physical perdition (Disparates 45-47). The same image appears in "La que da el filtimo paseo," a deeply unsettling text, which con- cludes with the following description of those who, unaware of the au- tonomous - and potentially hostile - nature of the inanimate world, unwitting- ly sit on one of those malevolent benches, thereby condemning themselves to death: "victimas d6ciles y candidas," Ram6n writes of these naive souls, "sen- tadas alegremente en el banquillo del torniquete, en plena ejecuci6n de ga- rrote vil"( Variaciones 108). Elsewhere, in "Los dos agujeros," the ramonian nar- rator lives in fear of his anthropomorphic house, which watches him day and night by means of two small holes in the wall (Disparates 162), while "Fragmen- tos de un diario abortado" describes the horror produced by the darkened windows of the building across the street, which threaten to draw all those who dare contemplate them into their yawning void (Variaciones 113). The ramonian "Rastro aesthetic" leads, at times, to similar, disturbing con- sequences. In an apartado of El Rastro with clear ties to Bufuel's description of 13 "Celui qui mangea un oeil de poisson," for example, offers clear parallels to Bufiuel's "Diluvio" (1926). 14 See note 6, above, regarding Ram6n's role in the elaboration of the screenplay. In Conversaciones con Buniuel, Bufluel reaffirmed Ram6n's primacy as screenwriter on the project, telling interviewer Max Aub that the film was "todo a base de textos, greguerfas y cuentos cortos de Ram6n G6mez de la Serna" (58).</page><page sequence="11">GO)MEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 363 the attic in "Tragedias inadvertidas," Ram6n describes his childhood discovery of a collection of items left him upon the death of a certain Sr. Andreu. It reads, in part, as follows: Estaba ya tranquilo, cuando un dia subi i la buhardilla i por cosas, esas cosas admirables 6 insospechables que se esperan encontrar en los desvanes [...] y vi aquellos baules, aquellos baiiles, aquellas cosas que no se me habia de olvidar nunca. Uno era chato y largo y parecia el atatid en que 61 estaba extendido y seco. El otro estaba entreabierto porque no le cabian las cosas dentro; le levant6 la tapa y vi dentro cosas crueles y an- tipiticas: un ros, una espada, y sobre todo vi una dentadura postiza y una manecita de marfil. (80) Horrified by his discovery, the child flees the attic, determined never again to confront the objects of Sr. Andreu lest he be contaminated with the aura of death they exude: Hui escalera abajo, me lav6 las manos y temi algfin tiempo tener el cincer [...] Pesaba sobre mi, con un nuevo aspecto grotesco mi herencia, una herencia que me hacia miserable, que me castigaba. (80) Having left the attic, the child attempts to distance himself from that horrible experience. For many years, he is able to live apparently beyond the reach of those "cruel," "grotesque," and "cancerous" objects of the buhardilla - until, one day, he discovers the Rastro: "cuando un dia descubri el Rastro, volvi a ver las cosas del sefior Andreu, y alin las sigo viendo, las veo siempre que voy" (80). The objects in the Rastro do, in fact, resemble the contents of Sr. Andreu's trunk in a number of significant ways. They are, for example, old; they exist in disorder; and they are found in a location that is, itself, disordered and sep- arated from the currents of every-day life ("El Rastro," said Ram6n, "es un lugar extranjero en medio de todo" [Rastro 201]). Given the existence of such simi- larities, it is important to recall that Sr. Andreu's belongings are also sources of horror which explicitly evoke the spectre of human mortality. In addition to the fact that their owner is, himself, deceased, the objects in the trunk conjure images of death and decay by virtue of their visual or functional association with such grisly topics as human mutilation ("la manecita de marfil") and vio- lent death ("la espada"). The trunk even features a "dentadura postiza" (sug- gesting mutilation, decrepitude, inauthenticity) which at one time belonged, presumably, to the corpse himself. If, upon entering the buhardilla, the ramon- ian narrator had hoped to discover "cosas admirables 6 insospechables," what he finds, instead, are "crueles y antipaiticas" icons to death. By establishing a di- rect parallel between that horrifying experience in the attic and the experi- ence of the Madrid flea market, Ram6n indicates that his contact with the dis- connected, disfunctional, and disaffected objects of the Rastro serves, at least 15 Later in the same apartado, Ram6n comments on his general fear of "manecitas de marfil," noting that a "trapero cinico" once used one to scratch at his eyes (81).</page><page sequence="12">364 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) at some level, as a disquieting reminder of the instability and impermanence of life. Other texts explicitly establish this connection between Ram6n's fascina- tion with objects and his awareness of death. In the prologue of Muestrario (1918), for example, he writes: Yo vivo un eterno ocaso de muerto [...] y asi me preocupo y me fijo en las cosas. Ese sentirme morir sin temores ni ideales de lucro inmortal, este sencillo sentirme morir es lo que da esa desvergiienza, esa corrupci6n y ese plante a mis cosas. (10-11) In the epilogue to El Rastro, he declares that the opportunity to write about the flea market has provided him with a temporary respite from the strangling ef- fects of this "fluida sensaci6n de ir muriendo" (257). Nevertheless, much like what happens in both "Una traici6n incalificable" and "Papier d'appel," there appears to be a stark difference between this affirmative act of writing and the reality of life experience which both pre-dates and post-dates the moment of creation. In the text of El Rastro itself, for example, there is little evidence that the actual experience of visiting the flea market ultimately produces in the ra- monian fldneur a sense of stability, tranquillity, or life-affirming certainty in any respect comparable to that which is evoked in the text's epilogue. Although some of the episodes are unquestionably upbeat, one can also find in numer- ous Rastro apartados highly disquieting descriptions of the flea market space. In a revealing passage - one which Bufiuel, significantly, will echo in the central vignette of his "Tragedias inadvertidas" -, Ram6n describes the guina- pos found swirling around the Rastro's environs as follows: Vilanos son esos guiiiapos que han estado colgados en los hilos del telI- fono y esos otros que han pendido de los irboles como restos del hombre ahorcado 6 del pijaro helado. [...] En ellos se revela lo trinsfuga, lo des- prendido que es todo. Hay en ellos una incuria trigica, un desgarramien- to, una inmoralidad intensa y manifiesta. (111). The same might be said for the flea market itself. For all the fascination it may hold, the Rastro is nonetheless an essentially problematic space in which con- cepts of stability, permanence, transcendence, order, and signification are all revealed as empty constructs. Like the guiiapos of the above quotation, the Rastro serves to underscore, by its very existence, "lo trninsfuga, lo desprendido que es todo." The disturbing consequences of human contact with the objects which, at once, create and incarnate the essence of the flea-market universe is further il- lustrated in Ram6n's short story, "La abandonada en el Rastro," which re- counts how a woman's fascination with flea-market objects ultimately leads to her own self-destruction. Increasingly dependent upon the Rastro universe for her physical and emotional satisfaction, she eventually succeeds in becoming a part of that universe, though only at the cost of losing her life: fragmenting herself into a chaotic heap of body parts - eyes, hair, corset, false teeth, etc. -, she is at last able to merit true inclusion in the Rastro space, her erstwhile hu-</page><page sequence="13">GOMEZ DE LA SERNA AS LITERARY MENTOR 365 manity indistinguishable now from the disassembled, non-functioning, non-sig- nifying "montones de cosas" found in the other flea market stalls.'16 The "cosas del sefior Andreu," in other words, have here returned, though this time Ram6n's use of mutilation and violent death is not figuratively ex- pressed through allusions to "espadas" and "manecitas de marfil," but rather literally and graphically perpetrated against a human character - one which, though female, in many ways resembles Ram6n's own self-described fldneur persona. By entering into the haphazard, chaotic, heterogeneous, and non-sig- nifying world of the Rastro, the female victim of Ram6n's short story - similar to Ram6n himself in "Las cosas del sefior Andreu" - is forced to come face to face with the similar non-transcendent and senseless qualities of her own life. As Ram6n writes in "Las cosas y 'el ello' ": Hay que comenzar a tratar [las cosas] de otra manera, y mis sabiendo que lo mis seguro es que seamos objeto, cosa final, estrato terrero, materia es- quirlada. [...] jQud no somos la cosa? Somos cosa, cosa blanda, con circu- laci6n asesinante [...] La heterogeneidad de nuestros fitomos hace in- estable nuestra vida, pues cuinto mis heterogeneidad, mis dispersi6n, mis flicil desmorono. (190-91, 203). "Inestabilidad," "dispersi6n," "desmorono," "circulaci6n asesinante:" similar terms might easily be applied to Bufiuel's vision of human existence as well. 18 In closing, I would like to return very briefly to "Una traici6n incalificable," and specifically to the question of the text's repeated italicization of the word mi. As indicated above, I believe that Bufiuel's peculiar choice of typography, in addition to underscoring the young avant-gardist's mocking attitude toward the aesthetic formulations of his nineteenth-century predecessors, is intimately related to the portrayal of object autonomy in this and other early bufiuelian texts. The narrative world described in "Traici6n," with its portrayal of anthro- pomorphic, self-willed, and "unspeakably treasonous" non-human characters, not only threatens the integrity of the romantic school's grandiloquent author- ial yo, it also threatens the integrity of the foundations on which the concept of individual identity is based. Bufiuel's mi is italicized, in short, because it is a word with no straightforward, literal meaning within "Una traici6n incalifica- ble"'s narrative world. In this, Bufiluel's first published text can be seen as but a particularly early example of the preoccupation with the fruitless search for integrity of self 16 The chapter of El Rastro containing "Las cosas del sefior Andreu" is entitled "Mont6n de cosas." For more information on "La abandonada en el Rastro," see Char- pentier Saitz's Las novelle de Ram6n G6mez de la Serna (esp. 128-35). A brief summary of the story appears in Gardiol (88). 17 In her analysis of Rende, the female protagonist of "La abandonada en el Rastro," Charpentier Saitz discusses the disquieting implications of the blurring of human and object as follows: "como cosa caduca propia del cementerio de cosas que es el Rastro, ella [Rende] representa un ejemplo vivo de c6mo el pasaje del tiempo afecta de igual manera tanto alas cosas como al ser humano, y recuerda la consecuente confusi6n en que se mezcla lo animado y lo inanimado en la muerte" (128). is In this context, it is interesting to note that Ram6n's text was published, perhaps not coincidentally, the same year that Bufiuel's Chien andalou, with its numerous se- quences of human mutilation and chaotic Rastro-like object displays, first premiered.</page><page sequence="14">366 GAYLE ROOF RHM, XLVII (1994) which lies behind many of the most celebrated, and most disquieting, images of his later artistic career. It is a preoccupation which will often be expressed, at least in part, via the destabilization of the standard hierarchical relationship between human observer and the surrounding inanimate world. As I hope to have shown in the preceding analysis, a similar message is articulated, albeit somewhat less menacingly, in the works of Bufiuel's friend and early literary mentor, Ram6n G6mez de la Serna. Though it would be inappropriate to as- cribe Bufiuel's artistic ideology, or even his treatment of objects, solely to his youthful fascination with Ram6n's aesthetic program, I believe it is undeniable that the ramonian model played a crucial role in the initial elaboration of Buiuel's avant-garde vision. The ramonian presence which hung so heavy in the air of early twentieth-century Madrid did, it seems, leave a trace after all. GAYLE ROOF UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT WORKS CITED Aranda,J. F.
