By Stewart Guthrie. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.290 pp. In a tone that is confident, maybe even a bit brash, in short sentences that rapid-fire across the pages, in prose that is clear about his likes and dislikes but never nasty, Stewart Guthrie proposes a new theory of religion. In contrast to those who see religion as emotion, irra- tional, or metaphorical, Guthrie, in the tradition of E. B. Tylor, sees religion as a cognitive explanation-- more precisely, as the systematic application of anthro- pomorphism (and animism) to the explanation of non- human (and nonliving)phenomena. Such arguments, which of course are not particularly new, usually claim that we humans conceive of God and gods as entities we dress up in human clothes. Guthrie's argument, however, is the more radical position that God and gods consist of anthropomorphic clothing. In his view, an- thropomorphism is not a question of dressing up the emperor in new clothes but one of constituting the clothes. The clothes make the emperor; behind the em- peror's garb, there is at best only more garb. Yet religion is a sensible strategy for explaining what we see. It is not irrational, it is not bound to ultimate concerns, it is not a voicing of the ineffable but a sensi- ble, logical explanation, which works, most of the time. Religion rests on the assumption that anthropomor- phism (and animism) is often more right than not or that if it is wrong no damage is done. If we see a dark figure at night and assume that it is a bear and it turns out not to be so, nothing is lost, but if we assume that it is not a bear and it is one, then we're in trouble. Guthrie cites as an example of this workable strategy Pascal's wager: In the face of uncertainty as to whether God exists or not, the French mathematician advised that the better bet is that He does, since with that bet</page><page sequence="2">Volume 37, Number i, February I9961 I7 we stand to gain more than we lose. Better to be safe than right. But why do we tend to see shadows as bears and gods as humans? Again Guthrie's answer, which itself is well thought-out, forms a cognitive chain. Perception, seeing, is never only pure seeing but always seeing-as. And seeing-as equals interpretation. Seeing is always seeing-as because boundaries are never clear. The way things go together is ambiguous. Living things create ambiguity by mimicking. A Costa Rican caterpillar looks like a local snake and so deceives its predators. Psychologists create ambiguity when they present be- fore us a drawing that could be either a rabbit or a duck. Primatologists create ambiguity by constantly blurring the distance between their favorite primates and hu- mans. In the face of this ambiguity, following Pascal, we bet that we see what is significant, and what is most significant to us has a human shape. In an impressive review of animism in animals and in humans and an equally exhaustive survey of anthropo- morphism in the arts, science, and religion, Guthrie is convincing that we today, no less than Tylor's primitive philosopher, are animistic and that we anthropomor- phize. These two fallacies are fundamental to human welfare. Why? Again, because, fallacious though they may be, they work, more often than not. For the most part, Guthrie's strategist, again like Ty- lor's primitive philosopher, is an individual thinker in- terpreting what is out there. Occasionally, and in the most intriguing manner, Guthrie suggests that anthro- pomorphizing allows us to create social bonds. Loneli- ness and unattachment are our greatest fears, and an- thropomorphizing permits us to address those fears and others socially. Here, Guthrie, quite correctly in my opinion, criticizes the oft-repeated notion that the an- thropomorphic sedative brings both comfort and relief. On the contrary, we often engineer situations to make ourselves unhappy. Unhappiness, no less than joy, is a social relationship. With a social bond, we fight the fear of unattachment. We would rather be hated than ig- nored. Furthermore, by creating a social bond, we bet that we will be able to influence the outcome. Anthropo- morphism is so pervasive that attempts to eliminate it in the arts and science eventually fail. In religion, which is ultimately anthropomorphic, theologians ultimately fail to create a language that allows us to address not only a gender-free God but a human-free being. Ad- dressing a God that is beyond addressing inevitably es- tablishes a social relation with a human persona. So we follow Faces in the Clouds to what conclusion? A new theory or not? This is impressive book, straightforward, confident, courageous. With his well-crafted presentation of reli- gion as anthropomorphism, Guthrie has rejected Pas- cal's advice; he would rather be right than safe. Despite this, it is open to two related criticisms, both, as Guth- rie is aware, ones that Tylor's work faced when Emile Durkheim took it under review. First, Where is the real- ity of religion? Durkheim argued that any human activ- ity as pervasive as religion must have a stronger base than cognitive error. As a latter-day Tylorian, Guthrie insists that he has met Durkheim's criticism by show- ing the pervasiveness of anthropomorphism in humans. The reality of religion is anthropomorphism. Yet error remains, and the error is a cognitive one. In following a cognitive path to explaining religion, Guthrie has all but ignored the performance, ritual aspect of religion. Robert Marett, in criticism of his teacher, Tylor, and of similar writings by James Frazer, suggested that both of these thinkers made religion too much a matter of thinking. Religion, he said, is not so much thought out as it is danced out. The reality of the dance is in the dance, in the positioning of my steps to yours, and not in the choreographer's head. Guthrie recognizes that no one worships an "ultimate concern," but worshiping is dif- ferent from thinking. Thinking up a social relation is one thing, but dancing it out in worship seems to me to be something else-something else that, despite his reference to social control, Guthrie misses. The second criticism is that any feature as common among humans as religion must have a general explana- tion. Guthrie has succeeded in establishing that anthro- pomorphism is a general human strategy for interpreting the world. It is found in the child, in the adult, in the scientist, and in the artist. What does such a pervasive strategy tell us about religion? Only that it is like the activities people engage in everywhere but simply more so. In other words, we find in Faces in the Clouds the familiar dilemma that the general is so general that it cannot help us cope with particularities. And it is in the particularities that we are. New theories open doors to insights as to what these particularities are up to. The idea of religion as anthropomorphism appears to lack that ability. In sum, Faces in the Clouds is a handsome, well- presented, well-argued work of a mature scholar, but it is a book that, as we come to its final word, we may well ask, "Now what?"</page></plain_text>
