<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOEKBESPREKING / BOOK REVIEW Patinir: Essays and Critical Catalogue . Edited by Alejandro Vergara. Madrid: Museo Nacional del Prado, 2007, 401 pp., ISBN 9788484801107. The exhibition of the paintings of Joachim Patinir (ca. 1480/1485- 1524) held at the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid in 2007 provided an unforgettable experience for those fortunate enough to see it.1 Moving through the several galleries devoted to the show, visitors encountered a succession of landscapes whose elevated foregrounds, almost always depicting a religious subject, give way to vast panoramas of mountains, coastal plains, and seas gradually fading into hazy distances. Five hundred years ago, long before bal- loons and airplanes, such expansive views of the earth s surface were virtually impossible in real life; not even Albrecht Dürer, when he climbed the belfry of Saint-Bavon in Ghent during his trip to the Netherlands in 1520-21, 1 could have commanded a prospect any- thing like those offered by his Flemish colleague. The art of Patinir, in fact, represents a supreme act of the visual imagination. The Prado exhibition has long since closed, but in compensation we have its magisterial catalogue, whose profuse and splendid illus- trations not only reassemble Patinir s paintings, but provide numer- ous details allowing us to peruse his vistas with a leisure that would have been difficult in the crowded exhibition galleries. Edited by Alejandro Vergara, the Prados curator of Flemish painting, this volume consists of a series of studies on various aspects of Patinir s art and career, followed by a Critical Catalogue of 29 pictures by the artist, his workshop, and several close followers and imitators, dis- played in the exhibition . This is supplemented by two appendices, one of the documents and literary sources for Patinir, compiled by Selina Blasco and Maximiliaan P.J. Martens, the other a chronologi- cal survey by Vergara of the paintings of Patinir and his workshop. An extensive bibliography and index conclude the volume. The essay section begins with "Who was Patinir? What is a Patinir?" in which Vergara reviews many of the topics developed at greater length by the other contributors, including the few documented details of Patinir s life and career, his artistic style, patrons, possible collaborators, and his place in the development of Netherlandish landscape painting. In an illuminating comparison of Patinir with his German contemporary Albrecht Altdorfer, Vergara suggests that unlike the latter s stylized landscapes, Patinir s more normative, realistic vision of nature rendered his art more easily imitated by other artists. Maximiliaan P.J. Martens* essay, "Joachim Patinir: The Good Landscape Painter* in Written Sources", contributes a valuable overview of Patinir s origins and career as gleaned from early written sources. Patinir was born probably 1480/1485; early writers disagree whether it was in Dinant or Bouvignes, but for various reasons, Martens favors Bouvignes, where the surname Patinir recurs in early sixteenth-century records. Admitted to the Antwerp artists* guild in 1515, Patinir died probably in 1524. He was admired by the famous Albrecht Dürer who in the diary of his trip to the Netherlands in 1520-1521 called Patinir athe good landscape painter". Martens reviews the archival sources for his life, supplementing them with further documentation, some of his own discovery, concerning the artist s two marriages, his children, and his purchase of a house in Antwerp in 1520. Also included is a section on Lucas Rem, Patinir s best documented patron (who acquired four paintings by the artist and his workshop), and a valuable analysis of the literary sources on the artist and his works in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In "The Devil is in the Detail: Ways of Seeing Joachim Patinir s 'World Landscapes*", Reindert L. Falkenburg pursues a reading of these works first developed in his Joachim Patinir. Landscape as an Image of the Pilgrimage of Life published in 1988.3 In the present es- say and beginning with an analysis of the Charon Crossing the River Styx, of which more later, Falkenburg questions the general assump- tion that Patinir *s landscapes did little more than mirror the beauty and diversity of the world. This may have been true for viewers who saw only with bodily eyes, but those endowed with "spiritual" vision, these panoramas offered religious and moral instruction. For one thing, Patinir often introduced small narrative scenes elaborating the main subject. Thus in the Madrid Rest of the Flighty the landscape harbors, among other episodes, the Massacre of the Innocents and the miracle of the wheatfield; in the Louvre St. Jeromey it is the theft of the ass by highwaymen and its recovery by Jerome*s faithful lion. Common in earlier devotional paintings, such subsidiary scenes were often drastically reduced in scale by Patinir so as to be visible only after prolonged scrutiny. It is thus only with the "inner eye", ex- ercised through a prolonged looking involving a change from bodily sight to spiritual insight, that the viewer discerns these augmenta- tions of sacred narrative, as well as the signs of the deceitful world in general, exemplified in the apparently innocent activities of the workaday world. Patinir may also have been inspired by the mon- strous anthropomorphic or animal forms favored by Bosch, such as the notorious "Tree-Man" in his Garden of Earthly Delights or the rock resembling an animal skull in his St. Jerome (Madrid, Museo Lazaro Galdiano). Falkenburg discovers comparable grotesque "geological" faces in Patinir *s landscapes, among them the Berlin Rest on the Flight to Egypt and perhaps the Triptych with the Penitence of S. Jerome in New York. "These geological marvels," Falkenburg con- cludes, "are designed to involve the viewer in a penetrating eye-travel, one that is geared to discover the smallest details in the darkest and visually most inaccessible cavities of the earth's crust. It engages the viewer in the same paradoxical hermeneutic of finding visual and spiritual enlightenment in precisely those motifs that are hard to see but (symbolically) signify blindness (the owl) or insightfulness, which runs like a silver lining through the perception of many early sixteenth-century Flemish landscape paintings." Falkenburg s observations usefully remind us that the religious aspects of Patinir s landscapes, and those of his successor and puta- 187 Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume izz - 1009 Nr. 2/3</page><page sequence="2">tive nephew Herri met de Bles, should be taken more seriously than perhaps we hitherto have. Nevertheless, it is not altogether evident that these paintings are images of the sinful world. As we shall see, the essays by Reynolds and Kren in this volume show that in the fif- teenth century, landscape depictions had been enjoyed for a variety of reasons, none of which were particularly "spiritual." Suggestive, too, are the inscriptions that Felipe de Guervara, around 1558, composed for two pictures by Patinir in his possession. One, for a landscape, subject unidentified, only praises its maker, invoking the old topos of the artist who challenges and even surpasses Nature in his imita- tion of her creation. The other inscription accompanied a painting of a shipwreck, a subject that would have offered De Guevara ample opportunity for musing on the "sea of this world", a venerable meta- phor for the vicissitudes of human life and divine retribution, in- cluding Job 31:23 (Douay-Rheims version): "For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me".4 In this case, however, De Guevara only describes how Patinir painted this scene to commemorate a violent sea storm that the artist had survived.5 While this instance is not conclusive, it does caution us against the assumption, without further proof, that Patinir s landscapes were painted, and perceived by sixteenth-century viewers, as "little sermons on sin".6 In "Multiple Advantages, Moderate Production: Thoughts on Patinir and Marketing", Dan Ewing examines Patinir s professional career. When Patinir entered the Antwerp artists' guild in 1515, the city had become a major center of art production, a significant pro- portion of it destined for the open market. In this milieu, Patinir s pictures, with their emphasis on landscape setting, represent a "product innovation", as Ewing calls it (citing J.M. Montias), or a "genuine mutation", as Ewing says elsewhere. But for all their novelty, Patinir s landscapes have their sources in the late fifteenth- and early sixteenth centuries, a subject that several writers explore at length elsewhere in this volume. Of the nineteen paintings attributed to Patinir in Robert Kochs 1968 ground-breaking monograph on the artist, a full sixteen were probably commissioned. Ewing dis- tinguishes three types of likely patrons and purchasers: those who employed his pictures as traditional devotional images (and perhaps most apt to have viewed them as Falkenburg suggests), humanists and others interested in cartography, and travelers, both actual and of the arm-chair variety. The map-like character of Patinir s land- scapes and their frequent inclusion of maritime scenes would have especially attracted much-traveled merchants like Lucas Rem, while such paintings as the Rotterdam Burning of Sodom and Gommorah , and the Charon would have appealed to the growing taste for Boschian diableries later culminating in the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Patinir s professional career is unique in early sixteenth-century Antwerp, a point that Ewing illustrates with several comparative tables. He never enrolled an assistant in the artists' guild or partici- pated in the usual guild activities, and his production hardly matches that of such contemporaries as Quentin Massys and Joos van Cleve. Nevertheless, his output is still impressive given his short working life and apparently small workshop (one assistant is mentioned by Dürer). He produced few replicas and no real "serial production" so typical of the leading Antwerp workshops. His earlier works were smaller and more often signed, as if he was seeking to establish his reputation; as for his later works, Ewing, like Vergara, suggests that Patinir "deliberately limited production in his pursuit of the high end of the market". Not a drunkard, as Van Mander thought, Patinir may have enjoyed financial independence through his second wife, who apparendy was wealthy, but why he did not strive for more than a modest output ultimately remains a question. Ewing s account of landscape before 1500 is elaborated by Catherine Reynolds in her essay, "Patinir and Depictions of Landscape in the Netherlands". Although landscape first emerged in Antwerp as an "independent" subject only after 1500, landscape specialists had collaborated with figure painters elsewhere in the Netherlands in the generation or so before Patinir, and even earlier, Flemish painters placed their sacred narratives in landscapes that developed from background regions to the foreground zones stag- ing the main figures or scenes. As Reynolds emphasizes, the natural environment had long been associated with pleasure and relaxa- tion, and among the earlier landscape depictions that she cites is a Gothic romance of ca. 1260 describing a room whose walls showed an extensive landscape, the landscape frescoes in the Papal Palace at Avignon, and the many fifteenth-century tapestries of hunting and agricultural scenes, as well as old records of painted cloths described as depicting often quite extensive stretches of actual topography. With all this interest in landscape, it is rather surprising that the term landscape to describe such subjects first appears only in the generation before Patinir. Earlier, Pliny and Alberti had described landscape depictions by itemizing their constituent elements, in- cluding "villas, harbors, landscape gardens", a formula still employed by Jean Molinet in his epitaph of 1489 for Simon Marmion, dis- cussed by Reynolds. The use of the word landscape as a shorthand term to describe the myriad components of natural scenery first ap- pears toward the very end of the fifteenth century, and I should add that landscape in various languages originally designated a district, a province, or more generally any extensive area of land, and it long re- tained this earlier meaning: in his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of 1570, Ortelius characterized regional maps as besondere Lantschappen ("particular landscapes").7 And it may have been these specific topographical associations that recommended the term landscape to describe fifteenth-century depictions of natural views with their often elevated perspectives and variety of scenic elements. In any case, as Reynolds notes, once adapted, landscape seems quickly to have become an indispensable term. Concluding that Patinir "combined possibilities already evident in Netherlandish painting", Reynolds cogendy suggests that the art- ist "and his compelling creations need to be considered within the history of landscape painting in all media, not just panels, and the history of landscape painting needs to be considered alongside that of other genres". This is a topic that Thomas Kren addresses in the following essay, "Landscape in Flemish Illuminated Manuscripts before Patinir." Due to the wider range of texts illustrated in manu- scripts (as opposed to panel paintings), not only sacred narratives, but also histories and other secular subjects, the Netherlandish 188 Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume izz - 2009 Nr. 1/3</page><page sequence="3">illuminators exhibited a great freedom in the depiction of natural scenery. Their landscapes anticipate Patinir in their continuous recession of space and deep horizons and in the often minor role they allot to the human figure. Moreover, in historical chronicles and encyclopedias, artists often represented specific territories, such as the province of Flanders in one manuscript or what is perhaps the "country of Great Britain" in another. While not topographically accurate, the resulting miniatures show broad vistas sweeping away into atmospheric distances; cities, towns and ships may be shown, but seldom human figures. Born when many manuscript illuminators were still active, Patinir probably knew their work, especially that of Lievin van Lathem (ca. 1438/ 1493), also active as a panel painter and a member of the Antwerp painters' guild from 1462 on. Although Van Lathem died before Patinir s earliest documented presence in Antwerp, Patinir could have known Van Lathems works in both media (per- haps through the latter s son Jacob, who, Kren suggests, continued Lievin s style). Particularly instructive in this case is the Hours of Charles the Bold, illuminated by Van Lathem in 1469 ( Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty Museum); its landscapes remarkably anticipate Patinir in their sequence of landscape and water, the "layering" of hues and color to create recession into space, and the steep rocks and cliffs rising abrupdy from ground and often crowned by monastic build- ings. While Van Latham never achieved the fully articulated "world landscape" characteristic of Patinir, Bles, and their followers, Kren persuasively argues that Latham could have contributed significandy to the development of Patinir s landscape style. In a final essay, "Patinir s Draughtsmanship Reconsidered," Stefaan Hautekeete reviews the various drawings attributed to Patinir over the years. Patinir s own draughtsmanship can be stud- ied in his underdrawings, many details of which, incidentally, are illustrated in the Critical Catalogue of this volume. He must have made preparatory drawings, and the detail and realism of his land- scapes suggest that he sketched after nature as well. But while Joris Hoefnagel in a letter of 1579 assured his Italian correspondent that it was possible to obtain excellent drawings by Patinir, no signed drawings him have survived, nor any drawing directly connected with his paintings. Indeed, in the sizeable number of Netherlandish landscape and topographical drawings that have come down to us from the first half of the sixteenth century, very few can be related to known artists, making it all the harder to isolate any examples possibly by Patinir himself. Thus Hautekeete understandably takes a skeptical view of the traditional attributions to Patinir, even the five drawings most consistendy connected with him. Among them is the Rocky Landscape in Rotterdam; accepting a suggestion of John Hand that it may copy a lost early painting by Patinir, Hautekeete assigns this sheet to one of the draughtsmen of the Errera Album (Brussels, Musées royaux des Beaux- Arts de Belgique). Another is the Landscape with St. Christopher (Berlin, Staadiche Museen, Kupferstichkabinett), inscribed patenter by a later hand; although more spontaneous in character than the Rotterdam sheet, its simi- larities to Patinir s own compositions and to his underdrawings con- stitute "too slender a basis for secure attribution". A third drawing, Landscape with St. Christopher (Paris, Musée du Louvre) Hautekeete connects with three sheets generally connected with Jan Wellens de Cock. As De Cock, recorded in Antwerp between 1502 and his death in 1 5 21, has left no known signed or documented works, Hautekeete wisely accepts John Hands attribution of the Louvre drawing to an anonymous artist "working in the style of Patinir". The final draw- ings are two studies of trees, one in the Albertina, Vienna; the other, inscribed "Joachim Patenier" in an old hand and formerly in the L. V. Randall Collection, Montreal. Their attributions to Patinir were made by Otto Benesch (who later rescinded his attribution of the Albertina sheet). Noting the presence of similar tree studies in the Errera Album, Hautekeete assigns them to an anonymous artist. In the Critical Catalogue, many entries written by curators of the collections owning the paintings, each of the 29 entries offers a suc- cinct dossier comprising the history of the picture, its description and iconography, and a technical study, the last often presenting in detail the results of a laboratory examination. Entries on the major works are also lavishly illustrated, frequendy including details of the reflectograms and x-ray photography that afford illuminating insights into Patinir s working methods. But even under the scrutiny of modern scientific methods, the attributions made by Koch in 1968 some forty years ago have held up remarkably well, albeit requiring some finer distinctions between master and workshop. Rather than review each entry in detail, I indicate some of their highlights with the catalogue numbers given in parentheses. In view of the evident collaborative nature of Patinir s work- shop, the main figures generally by other artists and the master s landscape formulas often replicated and varied by assistants, there is necessarily much discussion about the status of a given picture in Patinir s oeuvre, not only its placement in his chronology, but also whether figures and landscapes of a given work are autograph, by the immediate workshop, or by an artist working in the "circle of" Patinir. These and other issues are also comprehensively addressed in Vergaras appendix. A few examples may be given here. Vergara discerns twelve paintings whose landscapes and in some cases the figures are by Patinir. He would be inclined, however, to reject the attribution of the Karlsruhe St. Jerome (18) to Patinir himself, if it were not for the signature; if indeed an early work, as Koch thought, it dates some time before the Antwerp Rest on the Flight to Egypt (3) and related works that Koch placed immediately after the Karlsruhe panel. "The Meeting of Saints Paul and Anthony in the Wilderness (15, private collection), first published by Koch in 1996 as a Patinir, is here accepted by Vergara as a workshop piece: the background is in Patinir s style, but the figures (and, I might add, the picturesque hermitage which they inhabit) are distincdy alien, and probably are due to the intervention of another hand. In the past, the main figures in Patinir s landscapes were fre- quendy attributed to Joos van Cleve or Quentin Massys, but are now reassigned to their workshop assistants. This includes the pictures of the Rest on the Flight in Berlin and the Prado (4, 5), and the Prado St. Christopher (17). Exhibited for the first time is the splendid Triptych with St. Jerome , The Baptism of Christ, and Mary Magdalene (23), formerly owned by the Prince de Trabia and now in a Swiss private 189 Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume in - 1009 Nr. 1/3</page><page sequence="4">collection, which Vergara assigns to the workshop under the super- vision of Patinir, who may have painted the landscape himself. The group of St. Jerome and his lion has been over-painted in a more Italianate style, suggesting that the work found its way to southern Europe fairly early on. On its outer wings, not normally visible in the exhibition, but here reproduced in color, the triptych displays the dramatically-lit circular nocturnal landscape of Lot and his daughters fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah. One previously unknown painting has been added to the Patinir "group," a small Crucifixion (12, Madrid, private collection), which Vergara assigns to the "circle of Patinir". Moreover, the small landscape without subject in Rotterdam (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), together with another panel now in a private collection (both listed under no. 10) are fragments ofa larger painting that probably was an earlier version of the Thyssen Rest on the Flight to Egypt (9). The great St. Jerome in a Landscape in the Prado (20) shows the remains of a curved top, suggesting that it once formed the centerpiece of a triptych. The very first catalogue entry, on the Charon Crossing the River Styx, by Pilar Silva Maroto, returns us to the problem of meaning raised earlier in Falkenburg s essay. Inspired by a passage in Virgils Aeneid (6: 299-304), this work was likely commissioned by a patron with strong interest in classical literature. The boatman follows Virgils description closely, displaying Charon's "unkempt, hoary hair", "eyes staring orbs of flame", and "squalid garb [that] hangs by a knot from his shoulders"; however, he transports not a multitude of the dead, but a single figure between an Elysium inhabited by souls shepherded by angels, and a Tartarus guarded indeed by the triple- headed Cerberus of the classical Hades but also characterized by devils and fiery ruins more at home in a Bosch Last Judgment. And it is toward the latter shore that Charon steers and toward which his lone passenger gazes, seemingly without fear. For Silva Maroto, drawing on Falkenburg s earlier reading of this work in 1988, the two shores are the Earthly Paradise and Purgatory respectively, and the soul is at the moment of death, when he must opt for the path of salvation or that of damnation. For his part, Falkenburg refines his earlier interpretation, arguing that each of the two shores contains elements of the other and that the soul, thus deceived, chooses Hell in the belief that it is Heaven. If the soul thus fails to see through the devil s ploy, it is because he lacks that "judgment of man s inner eye", the lesson, as we have been told, of Patinir s landscapes in general. These two readings of the Charon raise questions that cannot be explored here, but this painting is undoubtedly Patinir s most enigmatic work. But even with its uneasy conjunction of classical myth and Christian doctrine, the Charon is also one of his most majestic. Its broadly flowing Styx draw us far beyond the realms of bliss and punishment to limpid distances, perfecdy embodying a text by John Banville with which Vergara prefaces his essay: "... I had a sensation of incipient weighdessness, as if at any moment I might float upward, wingless and yet wonderfully volant, and drift away free, into air, and light, the empty, cold and brilliant blue."8 But this is true of many of Patinir s landscapes, especially the other grand productions of his later career, such as the St. Christopher and the Temptation of St. Jerome. Even if "the devil is in the detail," as we have been told, the world harboring such details is viewed very much from the vantage-point of the angels. And our understanding of Patinir s achievement is incomplete until we have taken this more fully into account, a goal toward which the present catalogue, not least in its superb illustrations, has made a most substantial begin- ning.
