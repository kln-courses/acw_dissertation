Hamburg. 236 pp. A delightful little book on birds. There are brief chapters on structure and behavior, on "bird friends"-Aristotle, Pliny, Gesner, Bechstein, Naumann, Brehm and German ornithologists of the present century,-and a chronicle of the arrival and departure of birds in spring and autumn with mention of findings on migration routes and winter quarters through means of banding. Most of the book is devoted to accounts of species or families of birds, the majority of which are native to central Europe, while others are striking denizens of zoo or farm. Much of historical interest is given in regard to Jungle Fowl, Peacock, pheasants, Ostrich, and others. A good book for the beginner and layman, packed with sound information.-M. M. Nice. 66. Life Histories of North American Gulls and Terns. Arthur Cleveland Bent. Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, 1947. 333 pp. $5.00. A reprint of Builletin 113 of the U. S. National Museum, originally published in 1921. Ornithologists will welcome the appearance of this second reprint of Bent's "Life Histories." The Introduction has been rewritten and all illustrations are unfortunately omitted, presumably in the interests of economy. Otherwise the text appears to be unchanged. The absence of the "Explanation of Plates" changes the pagination of the "Index" and shortens the book by twelve pages. It is printed on good quality paper and attractively bound in cloth. - G. E. Hudson. 67. Flashing Wings. Richard M. Saunders. 1947. McClelland and Stewart. Toronto. 388 pp. $4.50. A compilation from the author's nature notebooks from 1938 through 1946, arranged by months, for instance-January 1, 1944, January 1, 1945, January 19, 1941, January 21, 1940. This scheme is rather confusing and at times disappointing when one reads on June 11, 1944 of the need of a nature reserve in the Holland Marsh Area and then hears no more of it until December 1946 when one gathers that the spruce-tamarack bog had been de- stroyed. The book concludes with a useful Bird Migration Chart for the Toronto region, a record of 21 Christmas Censuses of the 'Brodie Club and an index. Terence M. Shortt's numerous illustrations are very attractive. To the reviewer this book would seem to be chiefly of local interest.-M. M. Nice. 68. Man against Myth. Barrows Dunham. 1947. Little, Brown. Boston. 316 pp. $2.50. An eloquent protest against social myths that keep the privileged in power. Professor Dunham is rightly concerned over the problems of freedom and happiness in our world, and he presents many excellent arguments against current illusions, but his book is marred in places by prejudice and more seriously by ignorance of biology and ecology. Because of an unfortunate remark in 1938 by Stuart Chase about the Spanish Civil War, he attacks with wilful mis- understanding the whole subject of General Semantics (pp. 237-265), not realiz- ing that this movement is on his side, as its aim is to put thinking and doing on a scientific basis. It is extraordinary to read Professor Dunham's ridicule (pp. 61-67) of the modern view of the role of the predator, as ably propounded by Herbert Spencer as far back as 1888. More amazing still, he states: "No Malthus could now convince anybody that the population must necessarily outrun the food supply." (p. 20.) The truth of the matter is that the amount of arable land is inadequate to feed the present population of the world, yet this population is increasing at the rate of 50,000 people a day, while our arable land is steadily being washed out to sea. When will people who want to solx e social problems study the basic facts of biology and ecology?-M. M\. Nice. 69. One Day at Teton Marsh. Sally Carrighar. 1947. Illustrated by George and Patritia Mattson. Alfred A. Knopf. New York. 239 pp. $3.50. In "One )ay at Beetle Rock" Miss Carrighar related the experiences of a variety of animals in Sequtoia National Park; now she has done the same thing with</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XIX Recent Literature [99 1948 creatures that live in a marsh near Jackson Hole. The setting is a beaver pond, the day is the fall equinox, and the chief event that affects every one is the break- ing of the dam through the crashing down of the Osprey's dead cottonwood in the storm. The characters are a beaver, a mink, an otter, a Varying Hare, a moose; an Osprey, American Merganser and Trumpeter Swan; a trout, a frog, and even a leech, a snail, a mosquito and a scud. Miss Carrighar weaves her story skillfully; she enters into the life of each of these very different animals and without anthropomorphism depicts the interplay of instinct and learning. It is a fascinating narrative and one that adds to our knowledge and widens our sympathies. George and Patritia Mattson add much to the interest of the book with their spirited drawings.-M. M. Nice. 70. Canadian Spring. Florence Page Jacques. Illustrated by Frances Lee Jacques. 1947. Harpers. New York. 216 pp. $3.50. Another treasure of a book from the Jacques. In her vivid, inimitable style Mrs. Jacques tells of their great journey (largely by automobile, partly by railroad) to Canada in April 1946, first to watch waterfowl at Delta on Lake Manitoba, then west across the prairies to the National Parks in the Canadian Rockies, and finally north to Fort St. John and Hudson Hope in British Columbia, with the return journey to Delta in June. It is an enthralling narrative with wonderful descriptions-the Whistling Swans and Ruddy Ducks and WAestern Grebes, the antelope and Mule Deer, the mountains and pines and wild flowers. Mr. Jacques' sketches give the finishing touch of perfection. In her fine closing chapter the author writes: "I had loved this earth of ours as deeply as I was capable of loving it, and I felt content, holding close what I had received in return: a clear assurance of unquenchable life and joy." We, too, can have high adventure.-M. M. Nice. 71. Spring in Washington. Louis J. Halle, Jr. 1947. Wm. Sloane Asso- ciates. New York. 227 pp. $3.75. Our National Capital with its wild Rock Creek Park, the Potomac, Mount Vernon and the old canal at Georgetown is a wonderful place for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. The transfor- mation in the birds and plants traced from the first song of the Cardinal on January 22, 1945 to the sight of the last migrating Blackpoll Warbler on June 8. "Spring in Washington" is an inspiration with its keen, discriminating observa- tion of birds and trees, its fine style, and its philosophy based on fundamental values in life. It is a joy to look at with the distinguished sketches of Mr. Jacques that accurately portray the scenes described. The spectacular changes of the seasons in this favored spot are vividly and beautifully told by Mr. Halle; his book brings us awareness of the marvel of awakening life each spring.-M. M. Nice. NOTES AND NEWS Mr. Seth H. Low was transferred from his position as refuge manager of the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge on January 5, 1948, to take charge of the bird-banding program of the Division of Wildlife Research of the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. In his new position Mr. Low will direct the activities of the large group of cooperators who are scattered over the entire country as well as supervise the work of the central banding office at the Patux- ent Wildlife Research Refuge, Laurel, Maryland. He will be respons- ible for the interpretation of the immense file of data on banded birds, and will conduct investigations on special problems relating to North American birds which may be most effectively approached through analysis of the banding records.</page></plain_text>
