He defines Troy's "de- liberate system of sexual assault" in the sword-exercise, "researched" in Hardy's copy of Infantry Sword Exercises. Analysis includes comment on the rustic "chorus" and character contrasts. Troy is "effective as a foil to Boldwood; where the latter is slow, massive, profoundly obsessive, Troy is quick, light, and casual." Forces in The Native are pagan, classic, Christian, and Darwinian. In picturing Eustacia, Hardy, straining to create a rich personality, used too many cosmetic meta- phors, associating Eustacia with Sappho, Mrs. Siddons, Artemis, Athena, Hera, Bourbon roses, rubies, tropical midnights, lotos-eaters, and "the march in Athalie." He presented Egdon with such "anthropomorphic elabora- tion" that it is often called a character. (Mill- gate says little of Hardy's animism.) Egdon is a microcosm, the world of the characters, which Hardy sought to make his readers ex- perience as he had done for years. Millgate speaks of The Trumpet-Major's "dance-like pattern of courtship and rivalry and . . . its profusion of stock characters: a genteel widow and her marriageable daugh- ter; a jolly miller and his rival sons, one a soldier and the other a sailor; a comic miser and his miles gloriosus of a nephew." Two on a Tower might have anticipated twentieth- century science fiction, but Hardy left his stellar universe more a muted point of view than a factor in the action. Millgate comments that "Casterbridge" was the Dorchester Hardy had known as a child. Analyzing the Mayor's character, he concludes that "Self-made, Henchard is also self-destroyed; if he feels pursued, it is essen- tially himself that he cannot escape." In con- sidering Tess, Millgate rejects Alec as villain and asserts that Angel wrought the major disaster: "If Alec sacrifices Tess to his lust, Angel sacrifices her to his theory of womanly purity.... and Hardy has no hesitation in assigning to the latter the greater blame." Millgate points to items the casual reader might feel but not meditate: "The sight of Tess on the altar at Stonehenge looks back to Alec on the d'Urberville tomb and beyond that to Angel laying Tess in the abbot's tomb. . . . It is a marvellous touch of Hardy's to present the murder as if through the unin- volved, commonplace eyes of Mrs. Brooks, the Sandbourne landlady, and in terms which suggest a lurid newspaper report." Millgate finds Jude an inadequate expression of Hardy's views, saying, "If the intellectual concepts embodied in Jude do not cohere, that is perhaps because . . . Hardy conceived and composed his last novel as a comprehensive image of intellectual and social chaos." Millgate has chapters on "The Dorset- shire Labourer," "The Evolution of Wessex," "Candour in English Fiction," and "Hardy in the Theatre." Fourteen pages on the Dorsetshire laborer present the background for Hardy's portraits of rural life. The chap- ter on Wessex examines the facts in Hardy's notebooks from which he drew fictional scenes. Millgate's study is a perceptive, thoughtful analysis of Hardy's methods and meanings. Re-examining much that is found in previous scholarship, it is a book for any teacher presenting Hardy's novels to ponder and recommend to his students. J. 0.

SOMETHING WHICH CAN ONLY BE CALLED A Mayhew revival is evident in Victorian studies these days. Until about six years ago, Henry Mayhew's volumes on London labor and the Victorian poor, although well-known, had not received much scholarly attention. The resulting ignorance about the publish- ing history of his work led to errors in judg- ment not only about his intentions but also about the period he was concerned to de- scribe. (All the material was collected and most of it published in parts five to twelve years before the four volumes of London Labour and the London Poor appeared in 1861-62. This work dates from all three pe- riods of Mayhew's investigations: 1849-50, last half of volume III; 1851-52, volumes I and II and part of IV; I856, first half of volume III.) In 1965, however, John L. Bradley pub- lished his selections from London Labour with a long biographical introduction; in 1967-68 the four volumes were reprinted in DECEMBER 1971</page><page sequence="2">244 two separate editions, and a number of ar- ticles in both the popular press and the scholarly journals followed. With Gertrude Himmelfarb's essay in the March 1971 VS ("Mayhew's Poor: A Problem of Identity"), the counter-reaction has even set in, and we are told that Mayhew's editors and critics have claimed more for him than he deserves. The present volume is a representative selection from those articles appearing in the Morning Chronicle in 1849-50 which were not reprinted in London Labour, plus parts of Low Wages, Mayhew's apparently abortive attempt in 1851 to codify his economic the- ories. It covers most of his large categories, although one entire section on "Seamen Ashore" has been left out. With these selec- tions from his reports on Spitalfields weavers, tailors and seamstresses, boot and shoe makers, toy makers, merchant marines, and workers in wood available generally, the scope of Mayhew's investigations can be more fully appreciated than heretofore. In addition, the introductions by the editors give considerable information about Mayhew and his work. Professor Thompson fits the Chronicle series into its contemporary con- text and adds depth to Bradley's earlier biographical essay by citing other works by Mayhew and his contemporaries. (One error: the novel The Image of His Father by the Brothers Mayhew was published in 1848, not in 1851.) Thompson also recounts the various responses to Mayhew's articles and details the several feuds and disagreements which developed along the way. Mrs. Yeo rescues Mayhew's economic and social theories from the obscurity of the column "Answers to Correspondents" on the 1851-52 London Labour covers and puts them into a broad nineteenth-century perspective. Her discussion of Mayhew's sense of the connec- tion between economic conditions and cul- tural values is particularly interesting, as is her comparison of Mayhew's work with that of Charles Booth and Seebohm Rowntree. Despite the abundant information in these studies, Thompson comes to the con- clusion that Mayhew himself "remains a puzzling character and some final clue seems to be missing" (p. 19). Here lies the rub. As long as Mayhew remains a puzzle, London Labour and his other surveys will be some- thing of a mystery as well: any complete ex- planation of his work is ultimately bound up with our understanding of the man. Yeo does implicitly recognize the connection; although at one point apologetic for his lack of system, she shows subtler insight when she says the Chronicle articles "provide a unique and fascinating record of a mind in action" (p. 70). This record exists not only in this volume but continues throughout the whole of the sprawling, repetitious, sometimes incoherent, sometimes tedious, always incomplete work made up by the Chronicle articles, London Labour, "Answers to Correspondents," The Criminal Prisons of London, and some of the minor works. Our gradual sense of this "mind in action" plays a large role in our confidence in Mayhew as a social investigator and ad- miration for his surveys as literature. The reader who gives credence to Mayhew prob- ably does so not because he is always ac- curate (he is not), but because, seen through the very lack of system which we excuse, the nature of his struggle with his self-appointed task induces respect. If Mayhew's survey is not, as Eliot said of In Memoriam, a diary of which we must read every word, we must at least read beyond "gems" from London Labour to understand the achievement. In the first place, the sheer quantity of the evi- dence about working conditions in certain trades helps establish the validity of the over- all picture which emerges, while a random dipping and picking in his volumes empha- sizes only the quaint or the extreme. Sec- ondly, although Mayhew tried to efface him- self in his reports, we do gradually perceive behind the mask of disinterestedness a man obsessed by the problems of seeing clearly and writing objectively. The experimental nature of his work and its changing shape bring into focus his attempts to define his subject, his search for a proper form, his self- education about the lower classes, the lack of condescension in his curiosity, and his desire for a "scientific" method of social in- vestigation. Such knowledge of the man and his project grows slowly, and depends on the whole of what he wrote. For example, when one considers all of Mayhew's work, he ap- pears much more ambivalent about prevail- ing middle-class attitudes than Thompson seems to suggest. As a result Himmelfarb can claim that in London Labour Mayhew did "reflect, perpetuate, and reinforce an image [of the poor] that was fairly common at the VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">245 time" (p. 318), and Thompson can insist that Mayhew was completely free from any "mid- dle-class moral halitosis" in his Chronicle articles. The nature of Mayhew's work on the poor, however, is best explained by some combination of those two observations. It is the tension between Mayhew's acceptance and rejection of the attitudes of his contem- poraries which helps to explain the unique mixture of candor and objectivity in his inter- views and the balanced point of view which does emerge from his work as a whole. The more of Mayhew generally available, thus, the better will be the understanding of the individual parts. This volume with its knowledgeable introductions is a welcome contribution to the Mayhew revival. ANNE HUMPHERYS Herbert H. Lehman College, CUNY Styles in Fictional Structure: The Art of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronti, George Eliot, by Karl Kroeber; pp. 282. Princeton Univer- sity Press: Princeton, 1971, $11.00. FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT APPROACH ANY computer-study of literature with suspicion and distrust (and, perhaps, a nervous curi- osity and hope), this book cannot but be a surprise, even a shock. It is written by no literary hack attempting to cash in on the possibilities of the computer or to disguise, by means of statistics, his own incapacity to deal sensitively with literature, but by a gen- erous and original critic whose work here is surely a contribution to the study of the English novel. This book asks a lot of ques- tions and answers many it doesn't ask. But primarily, it allows a fine literary sensibility to do some careful and creative reading in response to his own large questions. Yet it has higher ambitions, and in Kroeber's own terms, the book is a failure, or at least only a crude beginning - it is but a step in the di- rection of a fully systematic comparative method by which an aesthetic history of the novel might be written. In regard to the larger goals of the study, I am full of doubts. But these doubts need to be seen within the framework of my own belief - contra Kroe- ber - that this is a successful, even an im- portant book. To begin with, it is necessary to lay out some of the central assumptions on which the study is built. When Kroeber asks whether it is possible to prove "without reference to evidence outside the novels themselves that George Eliot's fiction was written after Char- lotte Bronte's," he assumes, within a tradi- tion that has its latest manifestations in the criticism of Northrop Frye, that literature has its own language and its own history, a "system of continuity and innovation which is to some degree independent of, often resis- tive to, the influence of social transforma- tion." Kroeber also assumes (despite his more than grudging admiration for Leavis and other intuitive-evaluative critics) that the real job of the critic-scholar is to de- scribe objectively and precisely the instrinsic characteristics of literature, and their histori- cal development. He also assumes, in keep- ing with the tradition of the New Criticism out of which most of this generation of critics has grown, that literature lives in its details and that the larger categories, like the novel or romance, are meaningful only if seen in the context of the word, of style. Thus, Kroeber's book is a study of the stylistics of fiction, and the author assumes - or rather feels that the study has taught him - that "fictional prose style is quite different from nonfictional prose style." His book tries to prove that the larger structures of particular fictions are manifest in their smallest details. Finally, then, the true history of fiction must be built on comparative stylistics - careful analyses of the way different novelists use language in similar situations. Hence, eighty pages of tables, listing the numerical count of certain kinds of words, actions, settings, characters, in which Kroeber analyzes, among other things, the continuity of time, time spans, words referring to parts of the body, abstract nouns, the continuous presence of single characters, major and minor settings, sentence length, adjectives, subordinating conjunctions, and parts of speech in the works of his three authors and, occasionally, in other novelists. Without the text, these tables look like good fun. With it, they take on significance because they have clearly aided Kroeber in making some im- portant discriminations among the novelists. But this summary is far too crude. Kroeber understands from the start many or most of the difficulties of his assumptions as they are to be put into practice. Not only is it almost impossible to do a stylistic analysis DECENMBER 1971</page></plain_text>
