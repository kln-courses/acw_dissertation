      <p>Butterflies make up around 1% of the world's described species, but their contribution to popular culture is out of proportion to their diversity. Their wing patterns have evolved as signals, often aimed at either attracting or avoiding the attention of vertebrate predators, so it is perhaps unsurprising that we find them beguiling. Iconic images of butterflies have painted human culture, from the legends of ancient Greece through to the factory-produced art of Damien Hirst. This book attempts to “decode” this imagery, and ranges widely from a rambling trip through butterfly imagery in human culture in the first chapter, to a semi-scientific account of the role of wing patterns in signaling. Some of the ideas presented are wildly speculative—the death's-head hawkmoth is described as mimetic, not only with the Asian giant hornet, but also among other things, including a centipede, lizard, and spider; a swallowtail's tails supposedly resemble spines, conferring protection from predators. Such speculation can be fun—indeed an imaginative approach to these problems is crucial if science is to proceed—but, to my taste, the book veered far too abruptly from science to wild speculation, with little indication of where the boundaries lie. In a chapter on perception, the author admits the dangers of anthropomorphism, but then proceeds to use human autism as a means to decode insect signals, which seems to be a highly dubious enterprise. The volume focuses on signaling to vertebrate predators, with little acknowledgment that many butterfly patterns are likely to act as sexual signals to conspecifics, rather than complex mimetic patterns aimed at predators.</p>
      <p>In summary, this is a lavishly illustrated book that ranges widely across the topic of butterfly signaling. Well worth a look, but I recommend having a large pinch of salt on hand.</p>
