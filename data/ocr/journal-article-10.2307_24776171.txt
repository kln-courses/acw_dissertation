<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graeco-Roman Society and Literature By Barry Baldwin The thought of what America would be like if the Classics had a wide circulation troubles my sleep. Ezra Pound One might, by way of answer to the above, rephrase a well-known Roman proverb to read: Amor vincit insomnia. Pound's comment, written in the 1920s, is typical of the tendency to idealise the "classical" attitude towards sex and sexual freedom as being one of healthy toler ance and of acceptance of sex as a basic natural function, not to be contaminated by taboos and prejudices. This is an understandable reaction from the hypocritical and often oppressive attitudes of Anglo Saxon and North American societies. It is notable that a prime example of this idealising approach is Henry Miller (most explicitly, of course, in his Colossus of Maroussi, but the theme is implicit throughout his major works such as the Tropics and the Rosy Crucifixion), one of our most persecuted writers on sexual themes. Wayland Young, whose book Eros Denied I consider to be the best and most sensible account of sex Graeco-Roman Society and Literature By Barry Baldwin</page><page sequence="2">28 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature and Western Society, falls into the same error of assuming a uniform attitude on the part of Greeks and Romans.1 A natural consequence of this error is to assume that the Graeco-Roman world enjoyed an enviable tolerance until the advent of the Christian Church. Now, the Church has been one of the worst influences on sexual thinking. Its baneful tradition goes back to the aberrations of Paul of Tarsus, a perfect candidate for the psychiatric couch. His seed, unhappily, if the expression may be used in this context, fell upon very fertile ground. But regardless of the battle between the Christian Church and Eros in classical society, there still remains the paradox mentioned by Peter Green (in his Essays in Antiquity) that the Greeks have suffered from nothing so much as the deadening myth of perfection. This paper is devoted to puncturing the myth of perfection. There is no such thing as a "classical attitude" towards sex. Merci fully. Greek and Roman attitudes varied very much with the indivi dual; to some extent, also, with the various States. In Athens, indivi dual freedom of private behaviour was prized above all else, at least in theory. The State claimed certain obligations on the part of its indivi dual citizens, in political and military matters, but did not attempt very much in the way of social legislation. Here, a class distinction needs to be made. The rights of an adult male Athenian citizen were quite sharply distinguished from those allowed to women, resident foreigners, and slaves. This distinction obtained in sexual matters. For example, Solon, one of the earliest lawgivers, and venerated as the "founder" of the Athenian Democracy, is said to have forbidden slaves to engage in paederasty. In Sparta, the rights of the individual were subordinated to the demands of the State. The ideal of communal living for the citizen males, in military barracks, imposed severe restrictions on their domes tic life. A husband might visit his wife only on certain occasions, and then in a somewhat clandestine fashion. The chronic shortage of manpower in Sparta was allied to the Spartan belief in eugenics. To this end, sickly babies were exposed at birth, by order of the State, and Spartan women were encouraged to sleep with men other than their husbands in the hope of producing a perfect child from a perfect mate. A natural consequence of the communal living of the men was wide spread homosexuality and paederasty. Spartans were quite notorious for this, as Old Attic Comedy attests, with two important results. In Athens, admirers of the Spartan system tended to affect homosexual tastes, earning them a good deal of ridicule from Aristophanes, who is playing to a gallery of ordinary Athenian citizens and countrymen 1Eros Denied, New York: Grove Press, 1964, 70-76.

Cleugh, London, 1962.</page><page sequence="3">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 29 from Attica. This audience may well have despised male homo sexuality, not simply as "effeminate", but as something "foreign". The other consequence is that Athenian intellectuals such as Plato idealised the Spartan way of life to an absurd degree, providing the basis for Plato's suggested sexual regulations in his Republic. As to Rome, we may briefly distinguish the Republican and Imperial periods. Almost all Romans paid at least lip service to the importance of tradition. For them, tradition consisted in exalting the superior ways of their ancestors (mos maiorum), a practice typical of such Roman moralists as Horace, Juvenal and Tacitus. Down to the period of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Rome was governed largely by the Senatorial aristocracy, a body that made occasional attempts to regu late the private lives of citizens and subjects. One of the chief magis trates of the Roman Republic was the Censor ; two persons were appointed to the office annually. The office had little in common with the modern censors of books and films, but it did bear on the private lives of the Senators. The Censors could expel Senators from the Senate for "immorality", a charge not always well defined in practice; there was a celebrated case involving the archetypal Cato, who had a Senator expelled for kissing his wife in public. This was an extreme case, but shows to what depths the usually sensible Romans could sink. With the coming of the emperors, private morality was far more subject to legis lation. Augustus, the most notable ruler in this respect, passed a series of laws designed to encourage marriage and procreation, and to penalise celibates. These laws naturally failed. The policies of his successors varied widely, according to their individual dispositions. The early Christian emperors reverted to the attitude of Augustus, and there was an ever-increasing amount of social legislation in the fourth and fifth centuries. The attitude of a State is, after all, only a manifestation of a number of individuals' attitudes. The definition of Law as a crystallisation of the popular prejudice applies with particular force to sexual legislation. In the context of Greece and Rome, we shall see that this point obtains as much as it does in our own societies, especially in the sphere of homosexuality. It is logical, before examining the question of Eros in Greek and Roman literature, to survey the role of Eros in classical religion and mythology. In addition, a consideration of the legislation of classical societies concerning sex activities will be offered to help to illumine the question of freedom to deal with sexual matters in literature. It is well known that Love was personified as a goddess by both Greeks and Romans. The Greek language has more than one word for "Love", a fact which leads to the loss of shades of meaning in English translation. The three essential Greek words are: Eros (basically relat</page><page sequence="4">30 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature ing to physical love) ; Philia (basically relating to the concept of friend ship) ; Agape (the word usually employed in the New Testament to signify the concept of concern for fellow men). These words, and their cognates, are not used with absolute precision throughout extant Greek literature. The goddess is primarily associated with physical love. In Homer, she is discovered in flagrante delicto with the god of War by her cuckolded husband (also a god, albeit a crippled one). Her fellow Olympians, however, treat her adultery as a matter for laughter rather than censure. A system of divine eugenics ensures that her son assumes her role as an inspirer of passion in human beings; here, as before, precision of language clarifies the point: Cupid's name was derived from cupido, which indicates strong passion. This Homeric anecdote raises a point not always appreciated. It is conventional to describe Homer's gods as anthropomorphic. Indeed, the early Greek philosopher Xenophanes (fl. 550 B.C.) regarded them with disgust precisely because of their resemblance to men. He criti cised Homer and Hesiod, in his own verses, for imputing human vices to the gods. (Any standard account of pre-Socratic philosophy may be referred to for further details.) The charming picture of a family of gods with human foibles requires an important corrective. It is true that, as a rule, the Greeks and Romans did not look to their gods for moral precepts. However, divine misconduct did not sanction human emulation. The Greek society that smiled at Homer's adulterous Aphrodite was also capable of granting to husbands the legal power to kill an adulterous wife and her paramour. In contrast, the errant husband did not run the risk of suffering from the same penalty. The principle that a husband was allowed to wander outside the conjugal boudoir was sanctified by the Athenian orator Demosthenes. He is made to say : "We keep mistresses for pleasure, concubines for daily use, and wives to produce legitimate children and to look after our prop erty". Actually, it was disputed in Antiquity as to whether the speech containing this mot was really by Demosthenes. The question of author ship does not affect the point at issue. This state of affairs is natural in a society where the men monopolised the function of lawmaking. But it is important to draw a distinction between what was permitted to human beings and what was granted to the Olympians. In a lengthy episode in the Iliad, Zeus's many amours are catalogued, in detail. Included is a reference to intercourse with his sister Hera, later to serve (officially, that is) as his wife. The element of comedy dominates the entire passage. But this did not mitigate the abhorrence of the majority of Greeks for incest; otherwise the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles would not have been written. The sexual imagery in much classical myth and visual art is pro nounced. Representations of Hermes and Priapus in the form of statues frequently include an erection of the penis. In the Comedies of Aristophanes, performed at a festival in honour of Dionysus, there are</page><page sequence="5">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 31 references to the large and ornamental phallus worn by the comic actors to amuse the audience. The freedom of language in Aristophanes is celebrated. One need only recall the controversies in London, in 1958, when Lysistrata was presented in the West End, in an unabashed English version. The freedom of language far surpasses anything granted to our own stage, although we are approaching, at long last, a similar freedom for the printed word. It is ironic that our slow advances are being dubbed as "new" and "progressive", when we are merely attempting to regain something very old. Aristophanes' bawdy is usually explained by reference to the Athenian concern for parrhesia (freedom of speech), and defended (though one often has the feeling that he is more apolo gised for than defended) by appealing to the nature of the Dionysian rituals. There is a modicum of truth in this. The aforementioned imita tion phallus may represent a contemporaneously practised or obsolete ritual. Aristophanes does, occasionally, formally connect Dionysus with his "obscene" allusions, most notably in The Frogs, in which Dionysus appears as a leading character. There is one remarkable passage, which has the god allude to an incident when he was sexually excited, as a voyeur, and relieved himself by masturbation. But there is a danger of exaggeration. Not all Athenians approved of such freedom. There was more than one attempt to restrain the stage comedians by law. Pericles himself may have been instrumental in one such attempt.2 We are not obliged to impute these efforts to an Athenian Mrs. Grundyism. The political libels, aimed at leading men of the day, were more objected to, in all probability, than the bawdy jokes. Again, the very concentration of Aristophanes on "obscenity" makes one suspect some sort of desire to shock. In any case there certainly were Athenians who took strong exception to the traditional stories concerning the gods, Plato being the supreme example. Nor should it be forgotten that Dionysus was an unorthodox and controver sial god; The Bacchae of Euripides stands as eloquent testimony to this. It should always be remembered that attitudes varied widely in the Greek world. Modern writers constantly regard Athenian standards as synonymous with Greek ones as a whole. This is quite wrong. For instance, many Athenians professed to be shocked by the Spartan custom of allowing girls to take exercise in the nude, alongside boys. Plato, by contrast, approved of this practice and was for extending this equality to cover war and training for leadership. Corinth enjoyed a reputation for its amenable and venal women. A Graeco-Roman proverb said: "Not every man is lucky enough to be able to go to Corinth". Plato warned athletes in training to avoid Corinthian girls. 2There was one attempt in 440 B.C., another in 415. Horace refers to the suppression of the freedom of Old Comedy (with implicit approval) in his didactic poem De Arte Poetica.</page><page sequence="6">32 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and. Literature The fulminations of Paul of Tarsus are witness to the revival of Corinth's basic industry, after the town's destruction and re-creation by the Romans. We may now turn to the question of legal and social attitudes towards Eros on the part of the Greeks and Romans; then we shall be in a better position to understand their treatment of sex in literature. One point is immediately obvious. The scale was balanced in favour of the male, as we have seen already. Adultery might be hazardous because of the right accorded by tradition and law to the wronged husband. Of course, our picture is unbalanced, for almost all surviving Greek and Roman literature is written by men. Sappho is virtually the only example of the female voice (there are some love poems in Latin written by a certain Sulpicia, of whom we know little or nothing). Women could and did participate in literary activities. However, male reaction was less than kind. Witness, for example, Aristophanes' treat ment of Pericles' bas bleu mistress, Aspasia; the Roman satirist Juvenal regards the woman who recites poetry as one of the most odious types in his gallery of Roman women. Thus the status of women varied widely in ancient societies. A woman became Pharaoh in Egypt (the celebrated Hatshepsut). Cretan art seems to depict women on more or less equal social terms with their menfolk. But it is unsafe to base much on this sort of evidence, although it would give point to the Greek claim that paederasty was introduced into Greece from Crete! In the Athenian democracy, the woman was supposed, though the idea has been absurdly exaggerated by modern writers,8 to stay out of public life and away from the public eye. Pericles' comment in his Funeral Speech, as recorded (or fabricated) by Thucydides, is instructive: "The greatest glory of a woman is to be least talked about by men, whether they are speaking in praise or criticism." If Pericles really did say this, he is inconsistent, if not hypocritical. Aspasia hardly lives up to his prescription ! The status of Roman women changed in the later Republic and early Empire. Divorce became easier. Women began to demand a more official role in the affairs of state, though unofficial pillow talk had always obtained, of course, and they also began to take an interest in literature. We should notice, in this context, that women always played an important part in religious life. The opportunities varied tremen dously. She might be Vestal Virgin or Temple Prostitute, Priestess of Apollo or, like the sister to the eccentric Roman Emperor Caligula, sister-wife to her self-deified husband and then deified herself. This change in attitude towards woman and her status met with 3The best corrective to the usual nonsense is C. Seltzman, Women in Antiquity, London, 1956.</page><page sequence="7">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 33 bitter opposition from Roman writers such as Juvenal, who is respon sible for creating our stereotype of the Roman woman of the early Empire as a cruel, lustful, unfaithful creature. Since we have no Greek or Roman equivalent to Simone de Beauvoir or Edna O'Brien, the picture is hopelessly unbalanced.4 The triumph of the Christian Church, with its own prejudices against women playing any real role in secular affairs (a regression from the pre-Christian status of women as religious officials), has not helped. Fornication seems never to have been illegal in Greek and Roman society. We might infer this from the legal tolerance accorded to the female prostitute, and from the acceptance of concubinage as sug gested in the statement (quoted earlier) attributed to Demosthenes. The very word "fornication" derives from one of several Latin words for brothel (fornix). The Latin Dictionary shows that the word forni cari was introduced and applied to sexual intercourse outside of marriage by the early Christian writers; it is employed by the ascetic Tertullian and also in the Vulgate. Evidence for the legal and social acceptance of fornication by the male is widespread. Kiefer, in Sexual Life in Ancient Rome, quotes a passage from Cicero's speech Pro Caelio : If there is any man who thinks that young men should not be allowed to make love, even to prostitutes, he is indeed a man of strong moral righteousness, but he is out of touch with our contemporary attitudes, and even with the standards of our ancestors. For when was this sort of wenching not customary? When was it censured? When was it not allowed? When was it unlawful to do what was lawfully allowed? (p. 55) It is fair to say that we should always take Cicero with a pinch of salt, especially when (as here) he is defending a client whose private life was extravagant; but his reference to Roman tradition in this con text is decisive. Moreover, the censor Cato is said by Plutarch (Life of Cato, 21 ) to have established brothels on his estates for the benefit of his slaves. This same Cato is also made to defend the legal and social toler ance of brothels in Rome, in one of Horace's most pungent satires, on the grounds that their existence helps to reduce the inci dence of adultery, since they afford an outlet for young men. Indeed, in this passage (Satires 1, 2, 31-34), Horace applauds Cato's dictum as "divine". It may also be noted that the reforming Emperor Augustus made no effort to outlaw simple fornication as part of his crusade. There is no need to multiply evidences. Acceptance of male fornication 4It is a pity that so many writers persist in accepting the exaggerations of Juvenal as formal history. A reasonably balanced view is given by J. P. V. D. Balsdon, Roman Women, London, 1962.</page><page sequence="8">34 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature is implicit in almost all extant Greek and Roman literature.5 Adultery, attended by physical and legal hazards, began to be punished only by the early Christian emperors. The greatest contrast between ancient and modern sexual legislation is in the field of so-called perversions. By and large, a Greek or Roman had the freedom of his own genitals. There is no parallel to the American attempts to regulate the details of what happens in beds, even between man and wife. There was, indeed, one attempt by a Roman politician of the Republican period to introduce some sort of law concerning sexual behaviour. The terms of the bill specified ne fanda Venere (wicked love), but we do not know how this ambiguous phrase was defined. Perhaps it had to do with male prostitutes, who were certainly legislated against by a Roman emperor in the third century A.D., and by some of the early Christian emperors. We know, too, that Roman law provided for penalties against rape and seduction of pupils by teachers.6 Apart from regulations governing female prosti tutes, the above appears to be the sum total of sexual legislation. In general, apart from the restrictions already mentioned, it is safe to say that homosexuality was legal in both Greek and Roman society. There was little or none of the modern concern with diagnosing and "explaining" the homosexual, much less any attempt to "cure" him. Particular types of homosexual behaviour were specified. Paederasty, for example, was recognised to be a distinct type of homosexual prefer ence. It was imputed to such people as the dramatist Sophocles, and to Zeus ! Attitudes to male homosexuals varied. But many people disap proved altogether; at least they missed no chance to ridicule and criticise the male homosexual. Aristophanes caricatures the mincing fairy as cruelly as does our society in burlesque. Such victims are named quite openly. The pathic or passive type was singled out for particular mockery. The satiric poet Martial is very precise in his clinical accounts of various forms of sexual behaviour, and takes as much delight in ridiculing the pathic as does Aristophanes. The much more violent Juvenal attacks male homosexuals unsparingly; in his Second and 5See Licht (op. cit., 399) who concludes: "No-one found fault with illegitimate sexual intercourse, but looked upon it as a matter of course and spoke with the utmost frankness about it." Kiefer (op. cit., 60) observes: "It is a fact that originally the Romans had no statutory prohibition of sexual relationships outside marriage." ®The bill concerning nefanda Venere was introduced by a certain politician named Scantinius. If passed, it appears to have become a dead letter. It is pleasant to observe that this bill was brought in in an age later idealised by Roman moralists as the golden age of virtue! For examples of early Christian laws against certain sexual practices, see C. Pharr, The Theodosian Code, Prince ton, 1952, 232. These deal with regulations against male homosexuals, legislated in 342 and 390 A.D.</page><page sequence="9">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 35 Ninth Satires, he includes physical details as explicit as anything paraded by John Rechy, James Baldwin, or Jean Genet.7 This attitude has to be balanced against the more familiar "Platonic" picture of a noble love between men (which, as we have indicated, is an idealised picture of the attachments between men in the Spartan and Theban armies). We may hope, at this point, that the hoary old concept of Platonic love may someday be obliterated. To set the record straight, apart from the relationship between men, Plato also advocates {Republic, 5:457B - 466D) the following sexual regulations: physical sex between men and women is to be strictly controlled by his Guardian class; wives are to be held in common; a system of eugenics is to be followed for breeding perfect children; men and women are to cohabit at state-organised festivals; young men of special martial distinction are to be given more than usual opportunities for intercourse with selected women; within prescribed age limits, the chief purpose of intercourse shall be procreation. Outside of these limits, promiscuity is countenanced; any chance progeny is to be "disposed of" by the authorities. In one respect the Greeks and Romans were as guilty of absurdity as are modern legislators regarding lesbianism. Greek and Roman Law likewise permitted this practice by the device of not noticing it. The attitude of Greek and Roman literature is curious, although we must recall the fact that almost all of this is by men. Lesbianism is only infrequently alluded to. Aristophanes uses it as a source of laughter; so also does Martial, despite the fact that some of their references have been misconstrued. For instance, in his Lysistrata, Aristophanes has the women refer to the Milesian dildo, which is said to be currently unavailable. However, his women are very definitely heterosexual (this, after all, is the whole point of his play), and it is medically established nowadays that the dildo is not a basic form of gratification for lesbians, but for heterosexual women deprived of normal intercourse (for a Greek discussion of the dildo, readers are referred to the Sixth Mime of Herondas, a writer of the third century B.C.). Juvenal, in his attack on homosexual philosophers, makes a point of asserting his belief that women athletes do not perform cunnilinctus on each other; and he does not attack women on the grounds of lesbianism in his long poem against the sex. A word on Sappho. Her association with Lesbos, coupled with stories about the nature of personal relationships there, inspired Aristophanes to make play with the invented word Lesbiazein. This is 7The opening lines of his Ninth Satire are the best example; an act of oral genital intercourse, with a touch of anilinctio, is described. The whole poem con cerns the career of a male prostitute. Juvenal's attitude to physiological functions is often described as Swiftian, though some would accuse him of taking a prurient delight in the vices he professes to attack. His Second Satire is aimed at homo sexual philosophers, and has some graphic physical details.</page><page sequence="10">36 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature the source of our own word, and the use of "Sapphic" as synonymous with lesbian. In point of fact, it is quite unclear whether Sappho's sexual tastes ran to women. Her poems provide no very clear evidence ; she expresses passion for both sexes, and the mutilated state of her literary fragments defies any final analysis. Most of the ancient evidence derives from the aforementioned joke of Aristophanes. Whether Sappho had sex with girls or not, it is as well to indicate the tenuous nature of the evidence for the tradition. Finally, in this general context of sexual legislation, the question of female prostitution must be considered. On this well documented subject, I confine myself to a few salient points.8 Prostitution was legal in Greek and Roman society. Temple prostitution was only one facet, clearly distinguishable from the ubiquitous secular type. The status of the prostitute varied, according to age, looks and other attainments. Call-girls (whom the Athenians designated by the euphemism of "companions"), streetwalkers and brothel girls all co-existed. Our best evidence concerns the Roman period. The lupanars of Pompeii afford visual impressions of the trade; literary allusions (again, we stress, all from the male viewpoint) abound. The Roman authorities exercised a good deal of control over the activities of the girls. Street walkers had to register their names with the relevant authorities, and were obliged to wear distinctive garments. There was some attempt to regulate the opening hours of the brothels. The state, not excluding the early Christian emperors, was not above taking a share of the girls' earnings through taxation. The question of venereal disease is a matter of dispute. The establish ment of the Christian Church brought no great change, apart from the sensational efforts of the Empress Theodora, herself a great luminary of the profession (as readers of Gibbon will recall), to coerce the girls of Constantinople into reform. The girls were herded into a House of Repentance, on the Black Sea coast. Many were said to have com mitted suicide in preference to remaining there. The evidence, how ever, is from the hostile historian of the period, Procopius. In fine, the legal position of the female prostitute is in marked contrast to her counterpart in North America, and this needs to be remembered in the context of our topic. The literature of Greece and Rome reflects the above religious and 8The most useful book is Fernando Henriques, The Pretence of Love, London, 1962. This has chapters on Greek and Roman prostitution. Licht and Kiefer also deal with the subject and supply the primary source references. Perhaps the most interesting primary sources are the Dialogues of the Courtesans, by the Greek satirist Lucian (second century A.D.). It may be noted that this same Lucian was stigmatised as the Anti-Christ by the Byzantine scholiasts, although his actual references to Christianity are few and not specially malicious.</page><page sequence="11">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 37 social attitudes. It would be hard to discover a single example of censor ship of literature on the grounds of sexual content; political censorship is another matter and is not relevant here. The case of Ovid is a doubtful exception. It is frequently maintained by textbook writers that Ovid was exiled by Augustus because of the latter's objections to the poem Ars Amatoria. However, this is but one of the many specu lations which tend to be passed off as fact.9 It is difficult to classify types of literature dealing, in respect of theme or vocabulary, or both, with sexual subjects. There was a concept of erotic literature, despite the statement by Wayland Young: "The very existence of such things as erotic books or pornography in the Graeco-Roman culture is uncertain" {Eros Denied, 71). Plutarch, in his Biography of Crassus, mentions that the obscene Milesian Tales of Aristides were found in the Roman military baggage looted by the Parthians after their defeat of a Roman army in 53 B.C. For the Romans, Miletus tends to occupy the place that Paris does in the general European erotic mythology, and Plutarch is straitlaced on such matters. We need not question the general description of Milesian Tales. (The nearest extant guide to the nature of Milesian Tales is the Satyricon of Petronius.) The fact that no example is extant is as inevitable as it is regrettable. Aside from these tales, there is other evidence for the existence of erotic volumes. The emperor Tiberius, for example, kept a book, probably an illustrated manual of sexual posi tions, from Elephantis. Pornography is in the eye of the beholder. It is safe to assert that Greek and Roman laws attempted no legal definition of pornography. Simply speaking, it was never an issue, before the advent of the Christian Church. Though once the word "pornography" meant "writings concerning prostitutes", it has lost much of its original mean ing in current usage. The Greek word pornographos occurs only once in extant literature; there, it should be noted, it is applied to painters, not writers.10 The Oxford English Dictionary gives no example of the use of the English word before the nineteenth century: this we might have expected, though there had been cases involving the law and obscenity before this period. The first cited example shows the word used in its original and technical sense. Unhappily, the Dictionary shows that one of the first persons to apply the word in the current loose sense was the classical scholar Mackail I11 9For the countless theories see J. C. Thibault, The Mystery of Ovid's Exile, University of California, 1964. 10The word occurs in the third-century A.D. Greek writer, Athenaeus, in his Deipnosophistae (Learned Men at Dinner), xiii, 567b. This particular volume is devoted to the subject of women; it is translated in the Loeb Classical Library Series, Volume VI. nWebster uses the word, in 1864, with reference to the Pompeian frescoes. Mackail misuses it in his comments on certain plays of Plautus.</page><page sequence="12">38 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and. Literature Erotic themes abound in Greek and Roman writers. Most of these are too familiar to require detailing. The sensitive question of obscene language is more instructive, and is probably less familiar, in detail, in the Graeco-Roman context. Language rather than theme is frequently the chief issue in modern courts; notably, of course, in the epochal Lady Chatterley trial at London in 1959. Latin offers clearer examples than Greek. Not that it is richer in these: indeed, like English, the Latin language has few swear words fairly classifiable as obscene. We cannot always be sure of the precise level of diction at which each term was used, but most of the examples speak for themselves: Cunnus (cunt) ; futuo (fuck) ; cacare (to shit) ; mingere (to piss) ; paedicare (to bugger) ; fellare (to suck off). Lexi cographers have been reluctant to offer precise equivalents in English to these terms, and it must also be borne in mind that the Latin words may have undergone certain changes in their level of social accepta bility. However, the contexts in which these words are used, and their avoidance by the majority of extant classical authors, seem to establish that these words were generally regarded as "obscene". These are basic examples; many variations naturally occur.12 As in English, the words deemed most offensive are anatomical and physio logical in basic meaning. Another common phenomenon, exhibited by Latin, is the importation of foreign (Greek in this case) words of obscene meaning.13 This is part of the process of the development of colloquial Latin which felt the influence of Greek in many towns in Southern Italy, and over the Eastern Empire and parts of the West. The Satyricon of Petronius, and the graffiti of Pompeii are the prime sources for spoken Latin. Obscene terms are naturally frequent here.14 However, the above words are not widely encountered in extant Latin literature, despite the absence of legal compulsion against their 12A glossary of terms is appended to Friedrich Karl Forberg's Manual of Classical Erotology, New York, 1966. This tome contains a useful, though un critical, collection of erotic passages from Greek and Latin literature (and from later European traditions). Greek and Roman writers quite often used respectable words in sexual contexts, with comic effect. Aristophanes, for example, uses the word choiros (pig) to mean the female pudendum. The late lexicographer Suidas explains this as a piece of slang current in the brothels of Corinth. We may compare Aristophanes' usage to the frequent use of terms such as "little lamb pit" and "fabulous honey-pot" in Terry Southern's Candy. 13E.g. Petronius imports the Greek verb laikazein (to fuck) into the Latin of his Satyricon. This is not gratuitous, but serves the purpose of dramatic realism; the action occurs in a Greek town of Southern Italy. 14They are not so widespread in Petronius as one would imagine from the reluctance of translators to give a complete English version. It must be remem bered, however, that we are uncertain as to the precise meaning of some of his rarer words. There is a good English version by W. Arrowsmith, New York: Mentor Books, 1960. Petronius' themes are more to the point than his obscene diction. The Pompeian graffiti are much pithier, as is natural. It is amusing to note that many of the scribbled expressions of sexual satisfaction and yearning are by women; the inflectional precision of the Latin language makes this clear.</page><page sequence="13">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and. Literature 39 use—perhaps it is because of the absence of such restraints. They occur most frequently in the poet Martial; and occasionally in Horace and Catullus; hardly, if ever, in Ovid's erotic poetry; and are avoided in the speeches of Cicero. Why? The answer is not easy. A convention, or unwritten tradition, may be part of the answer. The importance of the Roman concept of urbanitas (which may be roughly translated as "gentlemanly sophistication") and gravitas (which carries the connota tion of an accepted standard of decorum in public behaviour) should not be forgotten here. Cicero is not reluctant to use strong colloqui alisms in his private letters (for instance, he once describes the Roman people as faex or "shit"). Sometimes he will take refuge in a Greek expression. This may be compared to the Gibbonian practice of utilising the obscurity of a learned tongue to cover his use of obscenity. Not that this saved Gibbon from attack;18 and some of our modern translators have had recourse to strange expedients. The Loeb translator of Martial, to take the best example, in 1919 translated all the scabrous poems into Italian. I can only assume that he regards the Italians as either incorruptible or corrupt beyond redemption. In general, Roman writers preferred colourful periphrasis and double entendre to downright obscenity of expression. Juvenal, who had no qualms about treating sexual subjects in his satirical poems, is an excellent example of this. Catullus, the most fiery of Roman love poets, employs both techniques.16 The whole matter seems to be largely one of individual preference on the Roman writer's part, and it is idle to lay down rules. Greek writers follow the same individual paths. Aristophanes employs obscene words, whereas the poets of, say, the Greek Anthology prefer circumlocutions, often very funny ones,17 and double entendre. The oratory of Demosthenes is unrestrained in matters of personal abuse (neither Greek nor Roman courts had anything in the way of modern libel restrictions), but he seems to eschew obscenity of diction. It should also be obvious from my discus sion that the classical stage, unlike the modern, did not suffer from the censoring imbecilities of a Lord Chamberlain. In the preceding pages, I have used the term "obscene", and its cognates, in purely a technical sense. The general picture I have 15Gibbon discusses this attack on his later volumes in his Autobiography. As precedent for the use of the "obscurity" of the Latin language, he cites Boileau's dictum: "Le Latin dans ses mots brave l'honnêteté." 18Two examples suffice. He describes some wretched rival's writings as cacata charta (shit-smeared paper). When assailing his former mistress, Clodia-Lesbia, for her insatiable lust, he says that she exhausts her lovers' penises by "stripping their bark off' (his verb is glubire). 17A favourite of mine is the description of a girl's pudendum as having the dimensions of the river Eurotas.</page><page sequence="14">40 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature painted looks very enviable, from the point of view of those of us who are opposed to censorship of the arts. However, would-be censors existed in both Greek and Roman societies. I have already suggested that the very nature of Aristophanes' bawdy presupposes the existence of people who could be shocked. Plato is the best example, from the history of Athens, of a would-be censor. He sets down his concept of necessary censorship in his Republic. But he differs from most of our latter-day self-styled moralists and vigilantes, for Plato is most con cerned with the Homeric portrait of the Olympians as exaggerated reflections of human beings with human weaknesses. Though their erotic escapades are obviously to be included in his censure, Plato is not a hunter of obscene words and books in the modern sense. In Rome, by contrast, there were people who claimed to find obscen ity in specific words. There was a clash of opinion between the Stoics who believed in absolute frankness of expression, and others who thought that there should be some restraint in language. Cicero discuss es this issue in a private letter written in 45 B.C. : he takes a middle course, agreeing with the opponents of Stoic bluntness, but ridiculing the excesses of some of them who detected elements of indecency in the most innocent of words.18 It should be noted that, in choosing restraint, he says that he is following the "restraint of Plato". Finally, the case of Martial is instructive, and offers another contrast to modern conditions. Martial, as we have seen, is the Roman writer most given to using unrestrained language. In the preface to one of his volumes, however, he takes time out to claim that, although his subject matter is scabrous, his personal life is not (lasciva est nostri pagina, vita prob a est). In other words, literature may be granted freedom of language, provided the author disassociates himself. This is quite different from our prevailing procedure, whereby an author has to be defended on the ground that his own experiences and background justify a particular theme or vocabulary. There is no need to append a long summing-up. The early Christian thinkers, notably Tertullian, attacked Graeco-Roman literature for its alleged indecency, as well as for its basic devotion to the pre-Christian gods. Details are obscure, but the Church is certainly guilty of de stroying many classical writings and works of art on moral grounds. The disappearance of the Milesian Tales and the like, and the loss of most of Petronius, can hardly be simple coincidence. Yet Martial's poems have been spared (by accident or design), as have many other exam ples of classical erotica. It would not be fair to claim that all early Christian thinking was of a piece. We recall the sympathetic picture of Jerome, struggling with his Ciceronian tastes in the belief that these 18Most of his examples lose their point in translation. I offer one of the more ridiculous. The Latin word intercapedo (interval) was allegedly objected to, because the last four letters contain the word pedo (to fart).</page><page sequence="15">Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature 41 were conflicting with his Christian duties. It may also be conceded that there was some common ethical ground between Christian principles and such a pre-Christian philosophy as Stoicism. However, on the subject of Eros, the most influential Christian propagandists introduce a quite alien attitude. Paul's celebrated views on marriage and vir ginity, and the elaborations on these ideas by Augustine, provide the basis for our own suppression-morality. Paul, Corinthians 1, and the treatises De Bono Conjugali and De Sancta Virginitate by Augustine are the most important references. Both Paul and Augustine admit marriage to be a necessary institution, but make it clear that the unmarried person is in some way superior. Augustine regards sexual intercourse within marriage as having the essential purpose of procrea tion, but he does allow that marital sex for pure pleasure cannot be altogether condemned. Nevertheless, he is explicit in claiming that chastity is superior to even marital intercourse for procreation. Such ideas were quite novel. Physical chastity was not regarded as in any way important by pre-Christian Greeks and Romans, save in the case of such professionally pure figures as the Vestal Virgins. It is clear, for example, that the Greek word parthenos (virgin) and the Latin word virgo (virgin) could be applied to a married woman who was faithful to her husband. Physical abstention was not involved in this compli ment. Greek and Roman writers enjoyed more legal freedom than we do to treat of erotic themes. At times, they suffered much more than present-day writers, but only in terms of political censorship. Their artistic freedom derives from their religious ideas and mythologies, and from the existing general attitude that the State should not regulate the private lives of its citizens. It is notable that Plato, the advocate of strict State control over the individual, is one of the earliest advocates of literary censorship. We may subjoin to this the fact that the Greek State of Sparta, notorious for its subordination of the individual to the State, and idealised by Plato for that reason, produced virtually no literature or art in the period after the creation of the full-blooded Spartan system. These observations cannot, however, be extended into a general principle. The idealising and sentimental approach to classical anti quity needs to be got rid of; the Greeks and Romans were tough minded people, for the most part, and we do them no honour or credit by pretending otherwise. Nor do we achieve much by appealing to such slogans as "freedom". In our own day, many of our worst "moral" censors are precisely those people who yap the loudest about "free dom". One thing can be said as a positive conclusion. The position of Eros in pre-Christian Greece and Rome was incontestably more respectable than in Christian Europe and North America. Augustine is perhaps more classical than Christian when in his celebrated prayer (in his</page><page sequence="16">42 Eros in Graeco-Roman Society and Literature Confessions) he says: "Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not just yet."
