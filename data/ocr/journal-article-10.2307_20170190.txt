<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 Form, Content, and Function: Theory and Method in North American Rock Art Studies POLLY SCHAAFSMA INTRODUCTION The rapidly accumulating body of literature on rock art, not only in North America but throughout the world, is indicative of the importance of rock art in current anthropological research. The greater part of the rock art record, due to its longevity, is archaeological in nature. It can provide the student of the past not only with information pertaining to culture history by means of style analysis, but also with complex graphic imagery that reflects nonmaterial concepts and ideologies not necessarily represented in other aspects of the archaeological record. Nevertheless, in North American rock art frequently has been regarded as an enigma by archaeologists, and its potential for understanding the past until recently was tapped only occasionally. Rock art, as defined in this essay, includes petroglyphs (designs pecked, scratched, abraded or otherwise cut into cliffs, boulders, bedrock, or any natural rock surface) and rock paintings (designs painted in similar locations). It does not include geoglyphs, or petroforms?designs formed by rock alignments on the ground. I find rock painting preferable to pictograph, even though the latter term is widely used and generally understood to signify a design painted or drawn on a rock. It is, nevertheless, an ambiguous term, etymologically having ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY, VOL. 8 237 Copyright ? 1985 by Academic Press, Inc.

Although picto has roots in Latin pictus, the past participle of pingere (to paint), the word could by modern definition (i.e., a picture standing for an idea) apply equally as well to a petro glyph. Indeed, picto graph was used as a general term for imagery in a variety of media in some early North American Indian art studies (Mallery 1886; 1893:205-227). Picture also has Latin roots in pingere, and certainly not all pictures in today's usage are painted. Research Trends Rock art research in North America, which dates back to the last century, has been variously summarized recently by a number of authors who cite the major works in this field (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:1?2; Heizer and Clewlow 1973:48-54; Grant 1967:4; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:33-36; Wellmann 1979a: 14-15). In an overall review of the literature up to 1979, Wellmann (1980:537:Table 6) found that the Southwest, the Great Plains, and the Eastern Woodlands are regions that have received the greatest emphasis, accounting for over 50% of the total literature output. In recent years (1970-1979) the literature on California and Baja California rock art has seen a significant increase. Gener al volumes on the rock art of North America, which organize subject matter by geographic regions, are those by Grant (1967) and Wellmann (1979a). The latter is a very detailed compilation dealing with styles and interpretive aspects; it is comprehensive in scope and will serve as a major and unrivaled basic reference for years to come. According to Wellmann in his analysis of research trends (1980:535: Works dealing with general topics (such as terminology; design classification; techniques and materials involved in producing, recording or reproducing rock art, style, and cultural affilia tions; conservation of rock drawings; and reports on rock art activities or the history of rock art research), all virtually nonexistent before 1950 and still rare between 1950 and 1970, enjoyed much greater relative popularity among writers after 1970. The subjects of chronology and interpretation (the latter being a term used by Wellmann without qualifications) have been treated more consistently over the years. Basically rock art research is still in a descriptive phase. There are a number of factors that account for this, not least of which is that art in the field of an thropology in general has tended to be regarded as peripheral or "trivial" as compared with "hard-core problems [such] as kinship and social structure" (Munn 1973:2). In spite of an early interest in rock art (Fewkes 1890, 1892; Gould 1900; Mallery 1886, 1893; Schoolcraft 1857; Vostrovsky 1895; Wall 1884; Whittlesey 1877, 1878; to mention a few references), it too has been</page><page sequence="3">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 239 traditionally neglected in the course of archaeological studies. However, as an immediately accessible but enigmatic artifact from the past, rock art has lent itself over the years to documentation, although attempts to take its significance seriously or to relate it to the regional archaeological record were few in the beginning. During the course of this century, as noted above, there has been a steady increase in the amount of research conducted with an expanded topical interest and a concomitant increase in the published literature (Wellmann 1980:534-535: Figure 2). In the last 20 years the emergence of and pressures associated with contract archaeology have not necessarily been conducive to the development of a prob lem-oriented approach and a theoretical structure with accompanying methods for analysis and interpretation. To "get it recorded before it is gone" is the all too familiar goal inspired by the destructive aspects of development as well as by an increasing infringement upon this cultural resource by vandals, as access to remote areas steadily increases. In response to accelerating need, efforts have focused on technical advances in field procedures and the development of standards for recording in order to establish guidelines for adequate documentation of rock art sites (Bain 1975; Clewlow and Wheeling 1978; Jones 1970, 1981; Lee 1982; Stuart 1978; Swartz 1980). Among technical advances of note, in addition to special photographic effects, photogrammetric documentation may eventually prove to be the most significant. By photogrammetry, all rock art present at a site can be mapped in its physical context, and an entire site may be reconstructed in three dimensions. Thus it is not only particularly important for conservation purposes (Rivett 1979) but also photogrammetry raises the potential for more complete site analysis and interpretation with regard to contextural considerations, an aspect of this field method that is just being explored (Bruder 1983). Consistent with these trends, there has been a major increase in the number of published works concerned primarily with recording and preservation between 1950 and 1979 (Wellmann 1980:535 and Table 5). Hand in hand with the need for increased site documentation and preservation is a need for public policy to deal with the problems posed by increasing threats to rock art sites. Specifically these issues gave rise to the 1980 conference at UCLA, "California Rock Art: Issues and Concerns" (Van Tilburg and Meighan 1981). Both the American Rock Art Research Association (ARARA) and the Canadian Rock Art Research Associates (CRARA), organizations composed of amateurs and professionals dedicated to conservation and preservation of rock art, are influencial in promoting public interest. By way of their respective publications, La Pintura and Newsletter (since May 1982 The Canadian Journal of Rock Art), they serve as a means of communication on a variety of rock art concerns. Within ARARA, a Conservation and Preservation Committee exists</page><page sequence="4">240 POLLY SCHAAFSMA specifically to address these issues through lobbying efforts and educational endeavors (Ritter 1981). Current Considerations Documentation and preservation efforts, as important as they are, should not eclipse scholarly research which, in turn, serves to justify these activities. It is the latter with which the remainder of this essay is concerned. Along with continued interest in field work, description, and preservation, are other prob lems that students of rock art have treated with varying degrees of success. Methods of dating rock art are of major importance, as are ways of relating it to specific cultural manifestations. At this time there is an increased interest in rock art as a graphic expression of the ideologies of prehistory and all that this implies. Among the questions raised are those concerning the various purposes art serves within the context of preliterate societies and the nature and function of symbolism, for which theoretical perspectives have been offered by anthropolo gists. This essay seeks to review from an archaeological perspective various research strategies and methods of analysis used in rock art studies today. Following a consideration of various methods of dating rock art, this discussion focuses on the interrelated aspects of rock art's formal qualities, its content, and function, with an attempt to show how these factors contribute to our understanding of past cultures. Although rock art research in the United States and Canada is the subject of this paper, works from elsewhere are occasionally referenced when they are particularly pertinent. APPROACHES TO ROCK ART Rock art research goals have varied in the past and still do. The focus here is on the methods of analysis and not on how data are retrieved in the field. Since, however, the theoretical foundations of a discipline, or the lack thereof, deter mine how research is conducted from the start, brief comment is merited on data gathering procedures before discussing dating methods or embarking on the substantial topics of style, symbol and meaning, and site function. Data Gathering Theory governs the questions we address and the methods and techniques that are useful in finding the answers. Theory and the problems to be solved, in turn, influence the kinds of data collected and the manner in which they are reported (Hill 1970:52). Kuhn (1974:15) observes that</page><page sequence="5">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 241 In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. This statement is particularly apt in regard to many cases of rock art field recording in which an attempt is made to record everything in hopes that all possible information will later be available to the future researcher. This ap proach is arbitrarily systematic, guided by field forms that call repeatedly for given information; but at the same time, the data collected lack specific focus and are not relevant to anything in particular. A specific case in point are the numer ous intrapanel measurements dictated by the "Minimum Recording Standards Proposed by the American Committee to Advance the Study of Petroglyphs and Pictographs" recently compiled by Swartz (1980:11-12). These measurements are without apparent theoretical justification and may never have any relevance to rock art problems. Nevertheless, partly because of the lack of awareness of specific problems with which rock art data can deal, the recording of too little, rather than too much, has more often been a difficulty, especially in the past. Increased awareness of the types of problems that can be approached through the study of rock art can certainly guide the course of field work, and today many recording guidelines are designed to at least anticipate problem-oriented research. In partic ular, in addition to complete documentation of the imagery itself, contextual relationships?relationships between figures, panels, rock art and other cultural remains, and a site's topographic situation are now regularly noted site features that in the past were commonly overlooked (Lee 1982; Swartz 1980). Such relationships are often crucial for understanding meaning and function of rock art as well as patterns of ritual, social, and political behavior. However, without specific problems to be considered or hypotheses to be tested (e.g., the archaeoastronomical implications of a site), certain potential information a site has to offer is bound to be overlooked. This problem is related to, but is not quite the same as, the epistemological debate in archaeology between inductive and problem-oriented deductive approaches. In contrast with most types of archaeological sites, rock art is not destroyed in the course of being studied, and as long as a site exists, it can be studied from more than a single perspective. Dating Rock Art There is as yet no means of dating rock art directly, and this fact is one of the major and most basic problems confronting rock art research. If rock art imagery is to be successfully integrated with its cultural matrix, a necessary step for its</page><page sequence="6">242 POLLY SCHAAFSMA use as an archaeological resource, there has to be some means of locating it in time. In order to do this, archaeologists dealing with rock art have been forced to devise a variety of approaches that may be used in concert as well as indepen dently. These methods have been summarized by various authors (Dewdney 1979; Meighan 1981; Schaafsma 1980:13-17; Wellmann 1979a:20-24). The dating of rock art is usually only approximate at best, and a number of strategies yield relative rather than absolute dates. Weathering and the accumula tion of patina or desert varnish, a natural formation of a brown or black stain of iron and manganese oxides may provide some clues. Relative age differences are indicated by comparative differences in weathering or by the amount of patina accumulated on petroglyphs with equal exposure on the same rock face. The more darkly patinated figures will necessarily be older than the others. Such comparisons are particularly valuable if more than one style is involved or if elements are superimposed (Figure 6.1). Consistent occurrences of superimposi tions as well as differences in degree of patination will establish a relative chronology between the rock art styles in question. (For a discussion o? style see following section.) Further, differences in the vertical placement of rock art on a cliff face can be a useful indication of relative age, as local changes in specific topographic features can influence the location of rock art through time. In some Figure 6.1. Petroglyphs from Petroglyph Canyon, Coso Range, California. A "late period" stylized bighorn sheep (Grant 1965) is superimposed on anthropomorphic figures. (Pho tograph by Sally Cole.)</page><page sequence="7">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 243 Southwest sites, for example, decorated areas high on cliff faces were formerly accessible via dunes or ledges, since removed by erosion. Elements lower on the same cliff, situated within scars left by former ledges or dunes, are necessarily later in age. Attempts at dating rock art directly by technological means such as lichenome try, which measures lichen growth (Beschel 1961; Dewdney 1979); neutron activation, which explores possible relative dating of petroglyphs by nuclear measurements of desert varnish (Bard 1979; Bard, Asaro, Heizer 1978); or by X ray fluorescence (Bard 1979) have had little success or are commonly in conclusive. Nevertheless, Bard (1979) using both neutron activation and X-ray fluorescence corroborated style sequences in the Great Basin suggested by Heizer and Baumhoff (Nissen 1982:256). The measurement of overburden ac cumulation on bedrock petroglyphs on the Northwest Coast or white deposits accumulated over rock paintings on the Canadian Shield have proved unreliable (Dewdney 1970; Lundy 1974). Irregular erosion, changing or discontinuous growth rates, and microenvironmental variables are complicating factors in all instances that involve on-going physical and chemical processes (Lundy 1974). The subject matter of the rock art itself, if it has temporal constraints, may bracket or place limitations on absolute dates. Horses, guns, ships, churches, houses, human figures in Western attire, or any other historic object present in rock art imagery defines its historic origin (Keyser 1977b; Wellmann 1979a:22 23). Even more refined dating within this framework is possible if the distribu tion of the pictured object can be plotted through time and space (see Wellmann 1979a:23, Map 3 for dating the northward spread of the horse in North America). Likewise, the depiction of the bow in prehistoric rock art establishes a bottom date for its appearance. This weapon spread slowly from the Great Basin where it occurred as early as 500 b.c., through the Southwest, reaching west Texas between a.d. 600 and 1000 (Grant 1968:51), and its presence in petroglyphs and rock paintings has been useful in establishing oldest possible dates in these areas. Thomas and Thomas (1972) and Sutherland and Steed (1974:6) use projectile point types depicted in rock art to hypothesize dates for sites in the Great Basin and in west Texas respectively. Similarly, labrets have been used to date North west Coast rock art (Hill 1975:19-21). Stylistic similarities between motifs on datable artifacts and those occurring in rock art are an important means of establishing the latter in time. Such cross media comparisons have been used extensively in the Southwest (Olsen 1980; Schaafsma 1980:197, 252; Turner 1963), on the Columbia River (Gjessing 1958), the Northwest Coast (Lundy 1974:264-265, 327-329), and in the East ern Woodlands (Wellmann 1979a: 156). Geographic correspondence between a given rock art style and a presumably related cultural configuration of known age is occasionally a useful means of dating rock art. Likewise, the association of rock art with specific datable habita</page><page sequence="8">244 POLLY SCHAAFSMA tion or other types of sites may be of chronological importance. In southeastern Colorado, Campbell (1969) assigned rock art styles to definite cultural horizons by using a frequency correlation between the art and associated archaeological sites for which age and culture were known. Consistent associations of given styles with sites of given dates have been particularly useful in establishing Pueblo rock art chronologies in the Southwest. In Glen Canyon, for example, Turner (1963:10-12) found a close correspondence between petroglyph styles and the distribution of sites with specific pottery types. In other instances, designs made from the rooftops of Pueblo III cliff dwellings may be dated from the age of the structure. It is implicit in the foregoing discussion that given styles have temporal as well as cultural definition. This temporal and cultural correspondence is one of the aspects of the style concept that makes it valuable as an archaeological tool. Because of the importance of this concept to rock art studies, further discussion is merited on this topic. Analysis of Form and the Concept of Style In 1958 Mark Papworth made the statement in reference to the Sanilac petro glyphs that, "the lack of a developed artistic tradition left the primitive artist free to render his designs as he saw fit" (Hatt, Richards, and Papworth 1958:43). In other words, rock art was regarded as being exempt from the patterning and structure observable in other remains of cultural behavior and therefore exempt from the theoretical tenets of archaeolgy generally. This naive position, which was not atypical for the time, has been superseded by more sophisticated percep tions on the part of archaeologists in the ensuing years. Scholars have subse quently recognized the patterning and structure present in the formal qualities of rock art, which in turn have led to the identification of specific styles and traditions with specific cultural relationships and chronological definitions. Because rock art frequently consists of what is seemingly inexplicable graphic imagery often spatially separated from other cultural material, the formal aspects of this resource have been a primary target for study. The history of so-called "formalism," an approach in which the physical form of the art is considered independently of other archaeological remains as a product in its own right and the prime component of the research, has been reviewed by Molyneaux (1977). In a historiography of rock art research in the New World, he divides the field into the two basic theoretical camps of "formalism" (that which deals only with the formal qualities of imagery) and "contextualism" (that which views rock art in its total cultural and physical contexts, taking into account its nonmaterial cultural implications). Further he shows how the basic theoretical approach influences the methods used in dealing with the data. In his words: The history of rock art research can be seen largely as a history of formal interpretation, with a progressive tendency toward the consideration of cultural and physical environments. Con</page><page sequence="9">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 245 textualism . . . does not achieve a cohesive form until the onset of conceptual changes after the mid-point of this century. (Molyneaux 1977:13) He further contends that the theoretical and methodological constraints provided by archaeology (science) have led to the neglect of the humanistic aspect of rock art. Molyneaux laments the emphasis on formalism in rock art research in North America in the past as well as what he regards as an imbalance of formalism in current research in which, he claims, the form of the art still bears the burden of interpretation. Nevertheless, the study of formal attributes in order to identify rock art styles has proven to be a useful means of ordering rock art. As discussed above, styles have specific cultural and temporal associations, and a spatial definition is also implicit. Areas of stylistic uniformity constitute interaction spheres (S true ver 1972) or panregional information exchange networks. Further, knowledge of what constitutes any given style facilitates the identification of visual systems, which relate to aspects of meaning and function. Thus the preliminary organiza tional and descriptive procedure of isolating and defining styles is not viewed as an end in itself, but as a step with further research implications. Nonstylistic Classification Schemes Before discussing the concept of style as such, it should be noted that there are various methods of dealing with the formal characteristics of rock art that do not conform to and that crosscut the style concept. Most of these are classificatory schemes by means of which elements are described and grouped on the basis of subject matter out of context. Steward (1929) dealt with the rock art of California and elsewhere in this manner. He was followed in this approach by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) and Heizer and Clewlow (1973), although the latter two studies attempt to reintegrate elements within broader stylistic frameworks (see below). Castleton and Madsen (1981) recently subjected Utah rock art to similar treat ment. Other general classification systems based on subject categories for computer analysis have been devised for California rock art (Pori and Heizer 1974) and for rock paintings of the Canadian shield (Maurer and Whelan 1977). Currently the nomenclature committee of ARARA (Robertson 1981a,b; Weidler 1981) is at tempting to establish a motif index, or universal classification system for rock art elements, a kind of typological key that can be adapted to a computer program with the intent of facilitating communication by making rock art information generally available. The desirability and potential usefulness, however, of an unavoidably over simplified universal scheme divorced from the nature of the material that is being classified is highly questionable. Meighan (1981:10) concludes that "It would be nice to have a standard terminology and method of classification, but that is no more feasible or desirable with rock art than it is with artifact collections."</page><page sequence="10">246 POLLY SCHAAFSMA The several classification systems discussed above have little to do with style as traditionally defined. Furthermore, these schemes lack relevance to the vari ous research strategies with which rock art can be fruitfully approached. A more meaningful approach to the formal dimension of art is a stylistic one with all of its theoretical implications. Style The concept of style has had long usage in anthropological research generally as well as in archaeology specifically. Style and its use in archaeological contexts has recently been discussed at length by Sackett (1977). Anthropologists con cerned with art in preliterate societies have also provided useful theoretical material and methods of dealing with art and style in other cultural contexts (Anderson 1979; Forge 1977; Kroeber 1957; Levine 1959; Lorblanchet 1977; Rands 1971; Schapiro 1953; Ucko 1977a,b; Wingert 1962). Basically, style theory rests upon the observation that a) "style concerns a highly specific manner of doing something and b) that this manner is always peculiar to a specific time and place" (Sackett 1977:370). Style consists of "a consistent set of preferences for certain forms and modes with a range of per missible variation. This range is determined by the society, and the artists ofthat society at any time operate within those limits" (Forge 1977:30). Similarly, as noted by Lorblanchet (1977:56), systems of schematization and systems of real ism are conventional processes that always correlate with a fashion, period, or region and thus have chronological value. Schapiro, in his comprehensive and often quoted discussion of the concept of style, notes that style is studied by the archaeologist more often for diagnostic purposes than for its own sake (Schapiro 1953:287). According to Schapiro, style refers to the form elements or motive, form relationships, and the qualities present including an overall quality that we may call expression. Further, technique, subject matter, and material may be included in style definitions, but these are not as peculiar to the art of a period as are its formal qualitative attributes (Schapiro 1953:287-289). These aspects of style directly pertain to the use of this concept in rock art studies in which it is recognized that only a limited number of formal possibilities of graphic expression are exploited by any given culture at any given time. The possibility that the same group of formal characteristics out of an infinite range of possible ones would ever be duplicated in time or space is extremely unlikely. (Within these general limitations it is possible, however, that a culture might be responsible for two or more styles contemporaneously, especially if these styles had different specific functions or occur in different media. This does not negate, however, the validity of the above discussed theory of limitations.) In spite of the cautionary note that elements, motifs, and subject matter may outlast their origi nal style setting (Rands 1971:137), it has proven useful to include the element inventory as an aspect of style in rock art research. More important, however,</page><page sequence="11">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES Figure 6.2. Examples of different anthropomorphic types. are the specific figure types making up this inventory. A figure type is the specific form and characteristic mode of expression of any given element (Figure 6.2). Overall, the forms used and the relationships between elements create a general aesthetic quality that is an important aspect of style (Schaafsma 1980:7). It should be noted that style is not synonymous with type. Type is a term restricted to elements alone, while style is all-encompassing (Figures 6.3-5). This usage is frequently confused in rock art literature. The usefulness of the identification of styles, which in turn constitute visual systems, needs to be stressed. The nature of rock art is such that one is com monly presented with a bewildering array of imagery that may have been ex ecuted over several hundred years by several cultural groups. The sorting of this imagery into style categories is a basic step in the organization and description of the data. If one is unable to identify discrete styles, that is, what consistently goes together, then one's efforts from that point are curtailed or made difficult. Resulting problems include relating rock art to particular cultural manifestations or time periods, understanding the evolution of styles or traditions that may indicate culture-historical relationships, or identifying the visual information or symbol systems that are the product of given ideologies. Understanding function based on such things as superimpositions and locational information may also be confused. Traditionally, the identification of style in rock art has proceeded on the basis of visual inspection of the material. Statistical methods have been used when element inventories and attributes are prime considerations, but as Hedges 247 ?</page><page sequence="12">B^Tm ^iifir?BlBflB^^^^ri^M^MfeftjB^ *: ^BBilTaS^lBgWlPWIBBBBlft^^PIK ^ ntmr^flK/ Met!?

Free-flowing curvilinear forms and the large sun wheels are characteristic of this style. (Photograph by Sally Cole.) (1982:208) cautions in a critique of Great Basin rock art styles as currently defined on the basis of element categories, although statistical techniques can provide valuable insights, they cannot substitute for a more holistic evaluation based on visual inspection and pattern recognition. The use of the style concept as an organizational device by means of which rock art can be ordered and placed in its temporal and spatial contexts might be compared with the use of architectural or ceramic styles that similarly can be used to order archaeological remains in time and space. Yet, the concept of style and its use in rock art studies is often misunderstood. The success with which the use of this concept in rock art research has been met has varied greatly, and this variation has depended in large part upon the expectations and theoretical ap plication of the style concept by the researcher. For preliminary descriptive purposes, rock art imagery has sometimes been organized on the basis of formal attributes along lines that are superficially stylelike or that partake of some of the aspects of style, but do not meet the rigorous definition of style necessary for its use as an archaeological tool. For example, Grant (1967:18-27) divides North American rock art into three catego ries on the basis of technique (painted, pecked, incised or scratched). These divisions he further breaks down by the application of the appropriate descriptive</page><page sequence="14">250 POLLY SCHAAFSMA Figure 6.5. Jornada style petroglyphs, Three Rivers, New Mexico. The style is charac terized by large static figures, usually pecked in outline. Heads and facial features are given special emphasis. Figures here include a bighorn sheep and two anthropomorphic figures. Contrast these figure types with sheep and anthropomorphs in Figure 6.1. terms, for example, painted stylized polychrome; pecked abstract curvilinear, and so forth. The result is the naming of 12 rock art "styles" for all of North America. For certain purposes of art history?for example, as a descriptive inventory of the kinds of visual imagery produced on rocks on this continent? these categories might conceivably be useful. While lumping into large classes imagery related only on a superficial formalistic basis, however, Grant fails to</page><page sequence="15">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 251 identify true styles that may be identified as the product of a particular cultural group during a particular time period. In this way Grant's method short-circuits the usefulness of rock art for archaeological research. This broad scheme has been specifically criticized by Lundy (1974:259-260), for example, who found it incapable of dealing with stylistic distinctions within Northwest Coast rock art. She also points out that style differentiation on the basis of techniques is not valid. As discussed earlier, in their analysis of Great Basin rock art, Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) and Heizer and Clewlow (1973) followed the lead of Steward (1929) who classified the content of the art into element categories for which he then charted the distribution. Taking this process one step further, Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) and Heizer and Clewlow (1973) divided Great Basin rock art into styles on the basis of techniques and element categories. The result is the naming of a handful of styles (Heizer and Baumhoff list seven and Heizer and Clewlow, who admit to relying on subjective evaluation as well, list nine). Gebhard (1963:563), however, in a review of Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) expresses the opinion that one of the most serious problems with the volume is their criterion for style. He states that: "a typological [i.e., element category] approach may more often than not omit the most salient characteristics of the art under discussion." Further, in a recent paper that expresses the need to sharpen the definition of style as an analytical tool, Hedges (1982) also points out that Heizer and Baumhoff s methods for style definition are faulty and that their style definitions are inconsistent, as element lists per se tell us very little about style and its component figure types. Problems with Heizer and Baumhoff s approach become immediately obvious in dealing with the so-called Great Basin Represen tational Style in which typologically divergent elements from culturally distinct regions are all lumped into the same subject categories (Dewdney 1979:330; Schaafsma 1971:84, 117). The problem is heightened by the following comparison: if one uses only the defining characteristics provided by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:200) it is possible to identify both the Three Rivers, New Mexico petroglyphs [Figure 6.5] (Schaafsma 1980:199-241) and the Coso Range, California petroglyphs [Figure 6.1] (Grant, Baird, and Pringle 1968) as examples of Great Basin Representational?both have mountain sheep, quadrupeds, hands, feet, horned humans, and figures which could be called 'Katchinas' as characteristic elements. (Hedges 1982:207) Hedges concludes that the Great Basin Representational Style is without factual basis. Certainly it does not constitute a visual system. Hedges further points out that the Great Basin Abstract Styles, although constituting an ancient and wide spread tradition, actually consist of a variety of styles and not simply the Cur vilinear and Rectilinear Style groupings defined by these authors (see also Baumhoff, Heizer, and Elsasser 1958). Difficulties in using Great Basin styles as</page><page sequence="16">252 POLLY SCHAAFSMA defined by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) have also been noted by Rector (1976), Thomas (1976), and Crotty (1979). As a final example of a problematical treatment of the style concept, one is referred to Turner's (1963:30-38) geographic extension of Glen Canyon rock art styles to include rock art in much of the western United States. Turner's five well thought out and valid Glen Canyon styles, which are located within specific cultural-temporal frameworks within the Glen Canyon region, lose their identity as well as meaningful cultural and temporal associations once they are projected much beyond the canyon system, and especially outside of the Anasazi area. The stylistic breakdown one observes is consistent with the observation that if style as a diagnostic tool is to have any usefulness, it could not possibly have such general applicability. In spite of the kinds of problems cited above, style, as a method for mean ingfully ordering rock art is "openly embraced" or at least tacitly accepted by modern researchers (Wellmann 1979a: 16). As discussed above, methods for identifying styles vary, and classification of rock art into styles on the basis of element categories has predominated in the Great Basin and in certain California studies. Methods based on pattern recognition, however, taking into account figure types, design components, and spatial relationships as they contribute to the general aesthetic mode, in addition to content, result in more sensitive cate gorizations. These in turn articulate more successfully with temporal, spatial, and cultural considerations. (See especially Gebhard 1960; Hedges 1979; Hud son and Lee 1981; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Schaafsma 1971, 1980; and Turner 1963 for California and Southwest studies.) Elsewhere Lundy's (1974) style sequences can be cited for the Northwest, and in the northern Great Plains styles have been identified and described by Gebhard (1951, 1969, 1974), Dewdney (1964), Malouf (1961), Keyser (1979) and Key ser and Knight (1976). Stylistic classification in the Northern and Eastern Wood lands is at best minimal either because detailed research has not been carried out, or because stylistic diversity is lacking. Swauger (1974:107), for example, claimed that style analysis was of no help in his work on the upper Ohio Valley petroglyphs. This, however, seems to suggest that Swauger failed to recognize this rock art as a part of a widespread style that manifests a basic homogeneity over a large region (Wellmann 1979a: 16-17). The Vastokases (1973:130) point out that style, if properly handled, can be used to establish culture-historical ties, a method widely used in Mesoamerica and in the Andes. They note that North American rock art is basically an untapped source of this kind of information. Their own work, on the Peter borough site, explores the relationship between the prehistoric petroglyph imag ery and that of the historical Ojibwa Mide scrolls. The similarities between them implies a culture-historical tie within an Algonkian framework. Styles that are similar in content and expression, and for which a temporal and</page><page sequence="17">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 253 cultural continuity can be demonstrated, constitute a tradition. In the Southwest and in Texas, several rock art traditions with culture-historical implications have been identified. Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:41-60), for example, deals with an evolutionary sequence within the Pecos River Style (the Pecos River Style as defined by Newcomb should be called the Pecos River tradition). These paintings have been associated with the long, slowly changing Archaic continuum represented in the midden deposits within the shelters where the paintings occur. The consistency of the paintings reflecting changes through time within the constraints of the basic tradition support the assumption of cultural continuity. Schaafsma (1980:242, 256-257, 306, Figure 199) discusses another major rock art tradition in New Mexico consisting of the Jornada, Rio Grande, and Gobernador Representational styles. This art tradition supports culture historical relationships based on other archaeological, ethnological, and histor ical evidence. Style and its Social Significance In addition to the culture-historical implications of style emphasized in the preceding discussion, a rock art style may be viewed by the archaeologist as a shared visual system?a shared repertoire of elements, figure types, figure com plexes, and aesthetic modes signifying participation in a given ideographic sys tem, interaction sphere, or panregional information exchange network (Schaafsma 1980:8). This view of style is one avenue for understanding how it functioned within its own cultural context. It is a well-established observation that the artist in a preliterate culture seeks to conform to social and traditional expectations in his work, which is created to serve religious, social, and political ends. The result is that style reinforces cultural identity and, in so doing, it functions as a means of social integration. As Schapiro (1953:287) has expressed it: style reflects or projects the inner form of collective feeling and thinking. As such, the expression of style is seen to function in maintaining cultural stability. Or, as stated by Sackett (1977:372), style is a form of standardization providing "a coherence and consistency to the fabric of everyday existence that promotes social living." On the basis of these observations, it could be suggested that the maintenance and definition of the geographic space occupied by a given cultural group was a specific function attributable to rock art styles as they are distributed over the landscape. It is thus clear that in addition to being a tool for the archaeologist, style as such has an independent significance as an integrative force within its own cultural matrix. As discussed at length earlier, since many rock art scholars have not come to grips with the meaning of style with its various implications, it is hardly surprising that exploration of this functional dimension of style in rock art has barely begun. A recent paper on function and symbolism in Chumash rock art (Hudson and Lee 1981) broaches this subject and may provoke new avenues</page><page sequence="18">254 POLLY SCHAAFSMA of investigation. The closely related topic of the covert relationships between art and cultural values involving symbols and meaning is discussed in the next section. Symbol and Meaning in Rock Art Content It has recently been pointed out by Hudson and Lee (1981) that although rock art is an obvious record of past ideologies, the lack of a developed method and theory for "gathering, analyzing, and interpreting rock art data in terms of ideology" has left this aspect of the prehistoric record poorly understood. They state: If this neglected segment of the archaeological record is ever to contribute to a much larger aspect of anthropological inquiry into past human behavior, it will require the development of a method and theory for coping with the cognitive content of rock art, one which focuses upon the linkages between art and culture, style and social group, context and function, and ulti mately symbol and meaning. They note that although further study is necessary for the development of method and theory for understanding function and symbol that two variables are evident: (1) the identification of the social group responsible for the art and (2) the function of that group within their society, which in turn, determines the purpose for which the art was made. They name the 'antap, a powerful priestly shamanic Chumash cult, as being responsible for the paintings of the Santa Barbara Painted Style (Figure 6.4). They define the 'antap primary functions as maintaining the Sacred in the Chumash world, maintaining cosmic equilibrium, and individual acquisition or manipulation of power. Their interpretations of symbol, meaning, and site function is structured within this framework. In this case interpretation of the art is facilitated by the availability of ethnographic information. Nev ertheless, the strategy that they employ is demonstrated to be a useful one, establishing guidelines for research elsewhere. The Nature of Symbolism Anthropologists have discussed at length the nature and use of visual symbols in the art of preliterate people, and a thorough understanding of what a symbol is and how it functions would seem to be necessary for even a preliminary grasp of the nature of rock art imagery. A symbol suggests a constellation of things having multiple cognate meanings, and it may vary in meaning depending upon the iconographie context in which it occurs (Forge 1977; Turner 1966, 1967). A symbol represents an effort to give tangible substance to subjective concepts (Wingert 1962:376-377), and it stands in contrast to the sign, or icon that is simply a reproduction of the object it represents. Lewis-Williams, who made an in-depth study of the eland as a symbolic figure in southern San rock paintings,</page><page sequence="19">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 255 states that there is no way to reach a ''bedrock" meaning, for "Symbol stands, in fact, behind symbol in an infinite regress." The implicational meaning is a totality of all available intentional meanings (1981:127-129). The ambiguity in the meaning of a symbol may have a corresponding visual ambiguity. Such ambiguity or abstraction functions to increase the power of an element by contributing to its esoteric nature. Greater abstraction occurs for the most sacred and enigmatic, which is a crosscultural principle of artistic ex pression almost universal in its regularity (Vastokas and Vastokas 1973:116, 134). At the same time, as Hudson and Lee (1981) point out, "for a symbol to have meaning, it must be shared, and to be shared, it must be conventional." The principles of ambiguity and conventionality are well illustrated in Apache symbolism described by Fairer: A circle bisected both horizontally and vertically forms a mnemonic that organizes much of Mescalero Apache life and ritual. The quadrant design produced can be, and is, explained on several levels: it is a 'blueprint' for a four day/four night ritual; it is how people should behave; it is the four stages of life; and it is how the world was made as well as how it functions. The design is said to be "the same thing" as a crescent moon and a four-pointed star painted on a dancer's body. And both design and moon-star are said to be "the same thing" as a narrative concerning natural elements and the goodness of life (Farrer 1979). This example illustrates also that visual symbols, important in ceremonial performances, have a key role to play in the transmission of cultural meanings and values. The expression of such values is the peculiar function of art in preliterate societies (Anderson 1979; Otten 1971). Together with style as dis cussed earlier, symbol and meaning can be viewed as having a homeostatic function in that they serve to strengthen cultural ties and values and thus help maintain stability and validate the human experience (Munn 1973). (For an excellent ethnographic study that probes the dynamics and significance of graph ic imagery in a preliterate society see Munn 1973.) There remains the question of universal symbols in ethnographic art. Fischer (1971) argues that the key to social conditions may be found in art styles and suggests that aspects of style are predictable on the basis of socialization data. If this were true, rock art styles should thus encode social conditions and provide a means of better understanding prehistoric societies. Anderson (1979) and Forge (1977) however, warn against art style as "cultural cognitive maps" (Fischer 1971), pointing out that although covert relationships between art and cultural values do exist, such relationships are very complex. Universal symbols and meanings in art have not been found, and meaning should be sought within specific cultural contexts at given points in time. Lewis-Williams (1981) notes that literal interpretations, as opposed to in terpretations based on the knowledge of symbols, have characterized an thropological commentary on the southern San rock paintings of South Africa.</page><page sequence="20">256 POLLY SCHAAFSMA Likewise, this is true for much of North American rock art. One type of literal explanation in common use both here and in South Africa is derived primarily from the economically oriented biases of the archaeological discipline, and this has to do with "hunting magic" when game or other animals are among the figures depicted. To quote: ' The insect motif at the site may reflect the portrayal of a subsistence practice. The depiction of snakes is also probable in view of their use as food" (King 1978:163). At a minimum, hypotheses regarding a hunting magic function for rock art should be strongly correlated with independent evi dence such as hunting blinds, trail networks, possible ambush locations, and so forth as described for Great Basin sites by Thomas (1976), Heizer and Baumhoff (1962), Von Werlof (1965:123-124), and Grant et al. (1968). Judging from site interpretations elsewhere for which ethnographic data are available, however, caution should be exercised against accepting a simplistic interpretation of even the Great Basin sites, viewing the sheep depictions as natural signs, signifying an economic resource merely. The sheep may well have had a complex symbolic significance implying a variety of interrelated beliefs and values to the Great Basin hunters, beyond that which a simple hunting magic interpretation would allow (compare the eland, Lewis-Williams 1981; also Reichel-Dolmotoff 1967, 1971 and elsewhere in this essay). Nissen (1982:634 636) suggests that the all big-game animals may have been symbolized by the sheep depictions. Ethnographic data verify that charming an animal before the hunt can be accomplished by painting and carving its image, as well as by poetry, song, dance, sacrifice, music, etc. (F?rst 1977:11). F?rst, however, stresses that an anecdotal interpretation of art, "deriving solely from the immedi ate needs of the stomach" is highly inadequate, pointing out that man is not focused on mere biological survival, but has a highly complex mythological structure and rich oral literature with which he relates to the world. Further, "Physical survival depends on a multi-dimensional equilibrium of which the shaman is guardian and for whose maintenance he marshals all his gifts" (F?rst 1977:13). The early artist-shaman depicted a mystical reality and experience that was far from mundane concerns. An exemplary study in which interpretation fully exploits the meaning and function of the symbolic concept is the Vastokases' research on the Peterborough petroglyphs (1973). Their aim was to determine the function and meaning of the site and its imagery within an Algonkian cultural framework. They explore Algonkian mythology, ideology, and world view, and specifically make com parisons between the petroglyph elements and elements of the Ojibwa Mid ewiwin scrolls in order to find meaning in the rock art. Further, the cognitive content of the art is enhanced through an exploration of the iconography of space by means of which the authors are able to suggest why that particular spot had been chosen for the making of the glyphs. They conclude that the site with its specific physical characteristics, including fertility symbolism, fullfilled the re</page><page sequence="21">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 257 quirements for a holy spot?a junction point on a vertical cosmic axis where sky and earth meet, a center in the Algonkian universe where communication be tween man and the spiritual realm could take place. These factors lead the authors to conclude that the petroglyphs are the record of the visionary experi ence of individual shamans. Methods of Interpretation Indeed, probing the ethnographic record, either for general guidelines that suggest ways of interpreting rock art or for the purpose of making specific indentifications when living descendents carry on artistic and ideological tradi tions from prehistory, illuminates the complexity of preliterate ideologies and warns against the error of literal or simplistic interpretations of prehistoric mate rial. Although suggestions from the ethnographic record have not been subject to rigid testing or "scientific proof," they often do offer reasonable explanations for what is present in the art (Meighan 1978:12-13). In the Northern Woodland area (Wellmann 1979a: 164), in addition to the Vastokases' research on the Peterborough site, Snow (1976, 1977) derives infor mation from Abnaki sources and Algonkian shamanic concept. Ethnographic comparisons have been particularly useful in the Southwest in the identification of elements and ideological complexes and in suggesting symbolic significance in Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache rock art (Ellis and Hammack 1968; Grant 1978:228-231; Michaelis 1981; Olin 1979; Schaafsma 1963:60-63; 1975: 55 58; 1980: 148, 294-299, 320-324, 335-336; 1984; Young 1982). In a recent study, Young (1982) explores extensively the significance and meaning in local ancestral Zuni rock art to contemporary Zunis. Their interpretations evoked myths and folktakes as well as direct interpretations. Ethnographic interpretation of content and function of rock art on the Northwest Coast is summarized by Wellmann (1979a:37-39) and is also discussed somewhat by Lundy (1974). For the Columbia-Fraser Plateau see Teit (1930), McClure (1981) and also Well mann (1979a:44-45). Southern cult elements with ethnographic continuities are present in the rock art of the Eastern Woodlands (Wellmann 1979a: 157). In California ethnographic sources on the iconography of Kumeyaay paintings have been explored by Hedges (1975:116). Ethnographic information bearing upon the specific interpretations of the content of Chumash rock art is also suggestive (Hoskinson 1982; Hudson and Lee 1981; Hudson and Underhay 1978; Lee 1977). As Young (1982) notes, however, even when there is close cultural continuity, one must be cautious in accepting all contemporary interpretations. There may be differences between modern responses and original meanings especially in re gard to older imagery or figures lacking distinguishing characteristics. The extent to which ethnographic analogies, with or without informants, can be relied upon must be evaluated in each case. Temporal factors, the degree of cultural con</page><page sequence="22">258 POLLY SCHAAFSMA tinuity, and the degree of similarity between symbols are all points that need to be considered. While Olsen (1977:288-290) uses Hopi symbolism to interpret Anasazi imagery in the Hovenweep vicinity in southwestern Colorado-south eastern Utah, her conclusions are significantly weakened by her disregard for style and its temporal and cultural implications, as well as a major change in Pueblo art after a.d. 1300 (Schaafsma and Schaafsma 1974). Lacking ethnographic information, or even with the use of it, one may seek other methods for the analysis or evaluation of the meaning within an archae ological context. Following Pager (1976a,b),Wellmann (1979b) in a quantitative analysis of superimpositions in Coso Range petroglyphs in California used this positional dimension as a test (Turner 1966, 1967) in order to determine whether or not significant linking?hence meaning?existed between elements. In this case, as elsewhere, superimpositioning is viewed as part of ritual practice and therefore intentional. In demonstrating that bighorn sheep are superimposed over patterned-body human figures in statistically significant numbers (Figure 6.1), Wellmann suggests that this nonrandom linkage had iconographie significance. A similar consideration was advanced by Meighan (1966) for superimpositions occurring in the Baja California cave paintings. In addition to superimpositions, other types of linkages between elements merit investigation as meaningful symbolic relationships. These include a specif ic element's relationship to activity groups depicted in the rock art, juxtaposition ing (where the scene is not a natural one) (Olsen 1980; Schaafsma 1984; Well mann 1976b), distortion, and "conflation"?the unnatural fusing or combining of elements (Lewis-Williams 1981:10-11; Young 1982:190-193) (Figure 6.6). One might add color, repetition, and the relative size of an element as factors to be considered along with the above in the evaluation of meaning and symbol (Hudson and Lee 1981). These potentially useful methods for recognizing pat terned associations in rock art content have yet to be used to any great extent in North American rock art studies, and have major implications for future re search. Finally, one of the methods used by Olsen (1980) to test the hypothesis that a cognitive system is present in the Anasazi rock art at Hovenweep was to analyze the distribution of rock art subject matter. A survey determined that not only was rock art associated with architectural and agricultural features but also that cer tain elements or symbols were found consistently associated with specific types of sites and not with others. She concludes that the nonrandom distribution of elements as well as their "degree of similarity and frequency of repetition" suggests that a cognitive network was in operation (Olsen 1980:130). Her data base, however, is limited, and her conclusions based on the association of specific elements with specific types of sites needs to be tested elsewhere in the Anasazi region.</page><page sequence="23">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 259 Figure 6.6. Rio Grande style snake and star motif, central Rio Grande drainage, New Mexico. The juxtaposition of snakes and stars is common in Pueblo rock art after a.d. 1325 and is believed to express the interrelated aspects of war and sky symbolism and serpents embodied in the Hopi katchina Sotuquang-u. Further, in the star is an unnatural combination of elements, an example of "conflation." Not only is there a central face, but also eagle feet on each side. Other star faces in the Rio Grande style have eagle feathers as well. Understanding Function As is evident from the foregoing discussion, it is not always possible or necessarily desirable to discuss meaning without giving some consideration to the question of function. Yet the content of the art may not necessarily reveal the function of a site and vice versa. It should be clear by now that the art of preliterate peoples, including rock art, is rarely Vart pour l'art, but that it was created for various purposes, and served a number of specific functions as it articulated with social, religious, political, and economic activities, or a com bination thereof. Two major routes to understanding site function are the identifi cation of the social group responsible for the art as discussed previously (Hudson and Lee 1981; Munn 1973), and a consideration of the various types of locational data a site presents, both of which may suggest a variety of purposes for which rock art was made. The Artist and His Social Context The importance of correlating rock art styles with particular cultural groups was discussed at length earlier in this paper. The rock art of hunter-gatherers might have, for example, a different range of purposes than that of village-based horticulturalists. Also, as we have seen, the social status of the artist within a</page><page sequence="24">260 POLLY SCHAAFSMA broader cultural configuration was noted to be of utmost importance in determin ing the meaning and function that art may have had. The specific role of the artist may be difficult to determine when ethnographic information is unavailable, and explicit methods for determining this have not been devised. Thus this means to understanding site function has been used only tangentially by most rock art scholars. Ethnographic accounts do, however, shed some light on the ritual and secular contexts in which rock art is made as well as by whom. These accounts, along with other types of data such as site situation and the content of the imagery, may sometimes provide models for understanding the function of pre historic examples as well. Adolescent girls, for example, participating in Luis?no and Cupe?o puberty ceremonies in southern California, made rock paintings at the conclusion of their races (Kroeber 1908:175-176; Steward 1929:227; Strong 1929:299). Rock paintings were also done by boys, specifically the winner of the race during the ant ordeal ceremony, which was part of their toloache initiation (DuBois 1908:92; for an overview see Minor 1973). Designs at prehistoric sites in the area that resemble those made in historic contexts may have had the same function. In the Southwest, Hopis on the salt pilgrimage recorded their clan symbols as petroglyphs at the shrine at Willow Springs to signify their participation (Colton 1946; Michaelis 1981; Talyesva 1942:235). Fertility or increase sites at which sexual symbolism is the dominant rock art motif are common in many areas of North America. At Zuni two stone pillars symbolizing a boy and a girl sacrificed to Kolowisi, the water serpent, mark such a site at which hundreds of female fertility symbols have been carved. The site is said to be visited by couples to ensure the desired gender of a future child, and it also functions in a general way as a fertility shrine for women who have been childless (Young 1982). It is not clear who actually carved the figures, but the number present suggests that carving them is part of the ritual requirement for a visit. As previously noted, rock art in the Santa Barbara Painted Style is believed to have its origins in the ritual functions of the Chumash 'antap cult which is generally shamanic in character (Hudson and Lee 1981). Likewise, the shamanic origins of the Peterborough petroglyphs (Vastokas and Vastokas 1973) has al ready been noted. Acknowledgment of the shaman's role as artist (art being one of a shaman's special talents and methods of communication) has in a number of cases contributed to an understanding of the function, as well as content and meaning, of both prehistoric and ethnographic art (Hedges 1983). Shamans are responsible for the production of art in connection with their roles of healing and keeping in touch with the sacred, and much North American rock art is believed to have shamanic origins (Garvin 1978; Hedges 1970, 1975, 1976; Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Keyser 1977a, 1979; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Schaafsma 1980; Snow 1976; Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). A great deal of the evidence for the shamanic origins of rock art, however, derives from the internal or pictorial</page><page sequence="25">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 261 evidence within the imagery itself, as opposed to outside criteria (Hedges 1976:127; Wellmann 1975, 1976b). This includes a tendency toward abstraction, and the presence of birds, snakes, skeletal and X-ray motifs, solar imagery, horned and other elaborate headgear, boats, fertility symbolism, and so forth. All of these elements commonly have shamanic associations in many parts of the world (Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). Both the Barrier Canyon Style in Utah (Schaafsma 1980:61-72) and the Pecos River Style in west Texas (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:37-80) are replete with shamanic imagery, a factor consistent with their presumed hunter-gatherer origins (F?rst 1977:2-3). Hedges (1976, 1983) presents an overview of shamanic imagery throughout North American rock art and in southern California specifically. From Montana, Keyser (1977a: 186; 1979:171-172) and Keyser and Knight (1976:9-10) present locational evidence that isolated sites containing abstract rock paintings functioned as retreats for persons on vision quests. This type of private site is also noted by Hudson and Lee (1981) in their study of the Santa Barbara Painted Style. Similarly, specific isolated rock art sites on the Northwest Coast are postulated as having functioned as private shamanic retreats (Meade 1971; Wellmann 1978). In decided contrast to all of the examples cited above, sheepherders passing the time of day seem to have been responsible for much of the rock art in the vicinity of modern Pueblo villages (Young 1982) and on the Navajo Reservation. This rock art, often occurring directly in association with corrals, includes both secular and religious subject matter (e.g., kachina figures), and it probably comes closer to being "art for art's sake," made for the sheer purpose of wiling away the time, than any other rock art in the Southwest. Site Location as a Means of Identifying Rock Art Function The spatial context in which rock art occurs has definite functional implica tions. It is a basic assumption that rock art will be located in a patterned way in relationship to both the landscape and other cultural remains, as it is integrated with a variety of specific activities that are in themselves presumed to be nonran dom. Also it is evident from the above discussion that locational data are often closely related to the problem of identifying the social context of the artist(s). Shrines. The physical setting was considered at length in order to under stand the shamanic function and symbolic significance of the Peterborough pet roglyphs (Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). Similarly, Reichel-Dolmotoff (1967) in his study of the rock paintings of the Desana of the Vaup?s region of the Amazon, deals with the symbolic aspects of place. The hills where the paintings occur, rising out of the jungle, are again a point of communication between man and the spiritual world. These hills symbolize large houses, or wombs where the Master of Animals lives and where prototypes of game animals exist and multi ply, and the hills stand for fertility, death, and access to the underworld. The</page><page sequence="26">262 POLLY SCHAAFSMA shamans come here to paint images of animals and designs signifying fertility, to pray, and thereby to communicate with the supernatural in requests for game, which, in turn, involves an agreement for payment with human souls. By this complex means, the shaman maintains a balance of cosmic energy. Hudson and Lee (1981) discuss landscape in relationship to Chumash myth, world view, and sacred places and the relationship of this interrelated whole to rock art. They point out that rock art occurs at sites connected with mythic events, where the art functions to connect the Chumash with their sacred past. By painting at these locations, the 'antap maintain the sacred in their surroundings. In the Southwest, a number of locations where rock art is present were or still are part of the spiritual geography of the Pueblo and Navajo people. In New Mexico, Arrow Grotto, an innersanctum of Feather Cave containing paintings and offerings, has been interpreted as a prehistoric Earth and Sun shrine on the basis of Pueblo and Mesoamerican ethnographic comparisons (Ellis and Ham mack 1968). In this case, as with the Peterborough petroglyphs and the Vaup?s paintings, spatial iconography provides some clue as to function and interpreta tion of the rock art. Other examples of sacred spots where rock art occurs include the junction of the Pine and San Juan Rivers in northwestern New Mexico and several locations in the vicinity of Zuni Pueblo. At the Junction site, the 18th century Navajo painted large images of the Twin War Gods whose retirement there after slaying the Monsters is related in several mythic accounts (Schaafsma 1963:63-64; 1980:310-312). Near Zuni, the fertility shrine mentioned above, and Hantlipinkia near the head of Hardscrabble Wash are places where signifi cant events took place in the mythic Zuni past (Young 1982). The paintings and petroglyphs in all cases serve both to identify and maintain important locations, honor the supernaturals, and in this way, as with the Chumash, tie the Navajo and Zuni to their mythic beginnings. Locational models provide clues as to whether rock art sites were intended for public or private use. Private sites, such as the shamanic retreats mentioned in the preceding section, stand in contrast to sites close to or within easy access of habitation spots that may be considered public sites to be viewed by everyone. The latter are usually less sacred, "dangerous," or powerful, than those with restricted access. Another aspect of location in regard to site function has been explored by Wellmann (1979d) who, taking the lead of urban geographers and other com mentators on graffiti (Goldstein 1973; Ley and Cybriwsky 1974; Mailer 1974), makes a number of instructive comparisons between graffiti and Indian rock art, and among his considerations is a comparison of the use of "exotic space". In both cases the inaccessible is often found attractive, but the reasons seem to differ. Among graffiti artists the use of such space, which must always be within public view, is self promotional, and it is done with a desire to impress the public. Wellmann suggests that the primary function of rock art in remote loca</page><page sequence="27">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 263 tions was propitiatory and that: "It is thus reasonable to assume that the value of the site as a spot consecrated to other worldly concerns grew with its remoteness and inaccessibility." Appropriately, Young (1982) has addressed the question of whether the sacredness of the location determines the meaningfulness of making rock art in a given spot or whether rock art imagery is sacred in itself. She concludes: It is, perhaps, impossible to separate place and image in this manner with respect to power, distinguishing one or the other as being prior or prime, since rock art characteristically brings together both the power of place and the power of imagery, juxtaposing the natural world with the human creative world. (Young 1982:179) Relating Rock Art to Economic and Social Functions. The locational situa tions discussed above have to do with shrines apart from other types of activity. In contrast, studies of rock art locations in the Great Basin have led to the development of the widely accepted and seemingly more pragmatic hypothesis that most of the petroglyphs there were made by hunters or hunt shamans directly in association with hunting ritual, or "magic," and the hunt itself (Heizer and Baumhoff 1959, 1962; Heizer and Clewlow 1973; Heizer and Hester 1978; Grant, Baird, and Pringle 1968; Thomas 1976; Von Werlof 1965;). (For alter native opinions see Rector 1977; Steward 1967). Supporters of this argument state that Great Basin petroglyphs have been found to occur consistently apart from habitation, or camp sites and along game trails, near prehistoric hunting blinds, at springs, or in topographic situations particularly suitable for game taking and ambush. Further, Thomas (1976), on the basis of attention to micro topographical features, with specific attention to the orientation of petroglyph faces, found that only those faces meeting on-coming or passing animals were carved. Similarly, carvings occurred only on boulders in positions to function as attack stations. This type of positioning is also claimed for Owens Valley petro glyphs on deer trails (Von Werlof 1965:123-124). Although abstract styles comprise most of the rock art in question, bighorn sheep and sheep horns are representational themes. A distinctive representational petroglyph style complex in the Coso Range, mentioned previously in connection with the superimposition study (Wellmann 1979b), consists of large numbers of bighorn sheep as well as atlatls, highly decorative human figures probably representing shamans, medi cine bags with anthropomorphic characteristics and so forth (Figure 6.1), all of which suggest a shamanic hunting ritual interpretation supported by the situa tional evidence (Grant, Baird, and Pringle 1968). Further comments on the interpretation of these sites that suggested a possible symbolic dimension to the art were offered previously. In the Southwest, Olsen (1977, 1980) relates rock art at Hovenweep to agri cultural adaptive functions. Problems in her research, however, have been cited</page><page sequence="28">264 POLLY SCHAAFSMA above. Another economic locational model has been used to predict the location of rock art as well as other types of sites in the Sierra Estrella in southern Arizona (Weaver and Rosenberg 1978). These authors found that petroglyphs were asso ciated with gathering camps and processing stations, although they concede that there is no way to tell if the rock art was associated with these activities or with activities of a noneconomic nature during the seasons in which hunting and gathering was going on. This type of predictive locational model thus suggests little about specific function. On the Northwest Coast, on the basis of ethnographic and locational data, the purpose of Tlingit petroglyph sites facing the ocean at the mouths of salmon rivers is believed to have been for enlisting supernatural aid in luring the salmon up the rivers (Keithahn 1940). Keithahn rejects the idea, however, that rock art in Tlingit territory was specifically associated with fishing sites. According to Lundy (1974), however, elsewhere it may have marked fishing spots. Locational information can be an indication of the social function of rock art. In the Northwest and the Southwest specifically, there is evidence to suggest that rock art was used as a means of identification and to denote boundaries and territorial rights. On the Northwest Coast it was used in historic times not only to signify fishing rights, but also to mark boundaries of family hunting territories and to proclaim trade monopolies (De Laguna 1960:71-73; Gjessing 1958; Hill and Hill 1974:34, 280, 286; Lundy 1974:295-299, 329, 334; Smith 1946). In the Southwest, boulders were marked with petroglyphs to define boundaries of land owned by various Hopi clans (Forde 1931). Also social functions for rock art have been proposed on the basis of the specific manner in which rock paintings and petroglyphs are associated with Anasazi Tsegi phase cliff dwell ings in Arizona. The distribution of elements, including hand prints, behind the rooms of Inscription House on the back wall of the rock shelter is suggestive that the figures, made by household occupants, either intentionally or secondarily, functioned to define household territories (Schaafsma 1980: 146-148). House hold clusters for Inscription House and other Tsegi phase cliff ruins have been defined by Dean (1970). Further, the distinctive large white paintings commonly occurring in limited numbers on the right-hand side of the village alcove, may have signified group socio-religious affiliations. These paintings, usually cir cular and visible from a distance, may have been statements about group identity and social relationships enhancing the feeling of solidarity among the residents (Anderson 1971; Schaafsma 1980:148). Archaeoastronomy. A distinctive aspect of locational evidence pertaining to site function has to do with archaeoastronomy. The connection between rock art and the field of archaeoastronomy generally has historical origins in a concern with rock paintings and petroglyphs that are postulated to be documentations of the Crab Nebula supernova of a.d. 1054. First proposed as an explanation for circle and crescent representations associated with Anasazi sites in northern</page><page sequence="29">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 265 Arizona (Miller 1955a,b), it has subsequently been suggested as a potential interpretation for a number of other sites in Utah (Wellmann 1976a), California, and New Mexico (Brandt and Williamson 1977; Brandt et al. 1975). Ellis (1975), however, marshals evidence against this view from the perspective of Pueblo ethnology. She notes that specific or unique events are not documented in Pueblo art, but that it is repeated or cyclical phenomena that have ritual impor importance. In light of the importance of keeping track of the solstices and lunar periods, she proposes instead that Southwest sites with sky symbolism are sun and moon watching stations (1975:6-61). It has subsequently come to the attention of rock art scholars that certain types of sites or even specific images had the primary function of dealing with celestial phenomena for calendric purposes. In this capacity there is evidence to suggest that prehistoric rock art was used in at least two and possibly three different ways. One of the first observations to indicate a possible calendric function for rock art was made by Hedges in Baja California. In this instance, a painting in a remote corner of a rock shelter is illuminated by sunlight at sunrise on the winter solstice (Hedges 1977:2; Hudson et al. 1979:51). Since then, detailed observa tions on La Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, have demonstrated that the petroglyph spirals there, situated behind three rock slabs, are bisected by shafts of light at the summer solstice and on the equinoxes (Frazier 1979; Sofaer, Zinser, and Sinclair 1979). Claims for a significant interaction between the spirals and light and shadow on the winter solstice and the lunar interactions, however, are unconvincing on the basis of the published material. The research at La Fajada has since prompted further investigations elsewhere in the Southwest (Preston and Preston 1982). In their research on Arizona sites (14 out of 18 of which are Anasazi sites located in Petrified Forest), the Prestons have found two types of calendrical sites involving petroglyphs: (1) the La Fajada type in which rock art images interact in meaningful ways with light and shadow at significant times and (2) sites at which specific petroglyphs function as sighting devices. At the latter type of site, the eye or head is placed next to or on the petroglyph in order to make a direct sighting of the sun, usually by sighting from the glyph along the rock face. The number of sites documented by the Prestons, some of which have rock art elements with multiple functions, and the patterning in their findings (ie., that the glyphs mark at least four solar declina tions), plus the La Fajada example build a substantial case for the validity of the hypothesis that an important function of some Anasazi petroglyphs in the period between roughly a.d. 800 and 1300 was for calendrical purposes. In all instances in which petroglyphs are found to interact significantly with light and shadow, the settings are probably natural, and the carved image simply marks a naturally and previously occurring light phenomenon. The claim that the La Fajada site was purposefully constructed is highly questionable (Newman et al. 1982).</page><page sequence="30">266 POLLY SCHAAFSMA Some researchers have proposed that rock art was also used to mark locations or "stations" for observing significant astronomical events such as solstice or equinox sunrises and sunsets (Benson 1980; Ellis 1975:86-87; Williamson et al. 1977). Such sites are often a point from which the rising or setting sun aligns with a significant horizon feature. Benson (1980:6) claims to have documented approximately 40 probable sun-watching sites in the Four Corners region, al though no supporting data are presented. Of the three types of sites discussed, this is the least precise and the most difficult to prove, and many of the proposed solar observation stations still remain in the speculative realm. Further, some of the best "Anasazi" sun symbols cited as marking sun watching stations in Chaco Canyon (Benson 1980; Ellis 1975), on the basis of style and associated elements, appear to be of Navajo origin. Clearly the archaeoastronomical function of rock art is a provocative field of investigation, and this area of study is still in its preliminary phases. The popu larity of archaeoastronomy at the current time may stem both from the fact that substantial evidence for prehistoric solar observations now exists, and also that it is an aspect of rock art that the Western world with its pragmatic orientation finds understandable. Yet even when prehistoric observations of celestial phenomena are documentable, one should not overlook that these observations articulated in a less obvious but complex way with ongoing cultural events that we would probably find less familiar. CONCLUDING REMARKS In the foregoing pages, the major problems facing rock art research today have been discussed. Brief attention was given to field procedures as they pertain to research problems. Methods of dating rock art, a factor critical to the use of rock art as an archaeological tool, were reviewed. The formal dimension of visual imagery, or style, as an organizing concept was discussed at length, and its temporal, spatial, and cultural implications were considered. The content of rock art and its symbolic significance, as well as questions of function, are aspects just beginning to receive real attention from students of the subject, and some meth ods of dealing with these areas have been examined. Perhaps, however, a few summary comments on rock art and its general relevance to anthropological studies are in order. From ethnological accounts we know that the ideational dimension of prelite rate peoples from all over the world is extremely rich and complex. We also know that this dimension is often expressed through visual imagery and is usu ally concerned with highly involved conceptual systems that reflect a peoples' relationship to their world. It is thus assumed that rock art, a common prehistoric art form surviving into the present, is one of, if not the most direct means of access to this nonmaterial realm.</page><page sequence="31">NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART STUDIES 267 Many North American archaeologists, however, have chosen to ignore rock art as an archaeological manifestation of an important aspect of prehistory. Perhaps as a reflection of our own ideological baggage and biases, the study of archaeology has exerted what is almost a materialistic imperialism over our view of the past by emphasizing the economic sphere, which is viewed as the funda mental determinant of cultural behavior and which is more susceptible to mea surement and quantification than is, say, art. When social, political, and re ligious factors are taken into consideration, they are frequently cast into an economic framework. Once the hypothesis was made and tested at a few Great Basin sites that the rock art there was related to hunting ritual and the procure ment of game, only then did Heizer and Hester (1978) feel that its study could be archaeologically justified. To quote: "Thus, petroglyphs are part of the fabric of the ecological relationship syndrome, and so their study is one which is now respectable in professional terms" (Heizer and Hester 1978:18). In another case, in a recent exchange of views regarding the definition of the Fremont culture in a collection of papers by Madsen (1979), Adovasio (1979), Aikens (1979), and Marwitt (1979), the potential of rock art is not explored as being a significant aspect of Fremont culture. Rather, whatever implications are present in rock art and the conceptually related figurines are regarded as the manifestations of a cult responsible for the spread of a "thin veneer" of traits (Madsen 1979:719). At the same time, even basketry techniques by themselves are considered sufficient evidence for cultural commonality (Adovasio 1979). That rock art has been traditionally disregarded by archaeologists is probably a manifestation of the general neglect of art within the recent history of an thropological studies as a whole. This problem is dealt with at length by Merriam (1971:93-95) who points out that there have been major misunderstandings about the nature of art and how it should be handled in investigations of patterns of human behavior. He goes on to say that often anthropologists have failed to grasp the essential nature of the relationships between social science and the humanities as well as art, which can be, and usually is, studied as a product apart from the behavior that produced it. Here again we have the familiar dichotomy of formalism and contextualism spelled out by Molyneaux (1977), as rock art studies have traditionally concentrated on the product as opposed to exploring its raison d'?tre. As Munn (1973:2) notes, the framework of symbolic theory can integrate the study of social, religio-cosmological, and aesthetic systems; art and symbol are major means by which basic cultural values and perceptions are expressed and thereby communicated and affirmed. The complexity that exists between the ideational and physical realms is where the uniqueness of each culture lies. Rock art is an important expression of this ideational dimension, where cultural behav ior finds its origins. As such, rock art cannot be ignored if archaeology is truly the anthropology of prehistory, albeit with its own methodologies especially suited for dealing with the fragmented remains of the past. Dewdney (1979)</page><page sequence="32">268 POLLY SCHAAFSMA stressed that the study of rock art is a multidisciplinary field. Meighan (1981:20) has recently advised that rock art scholars need to communicate with folklorists, and students of symbolism and aesthetics, as well as with ethnographers. Cer tainly the field has now matured to the point where future research will employ the principles for understanding ethnographic art developed by other anthropolo gists. Systematic means need to be developed for reaching beind the outer forms of prehistoric imagery in order to discern some of the aspects of symbolism and meaning and to discover various purposes rock art may have served. Studies attempting to accomplish this have been discussed at length in this essay (Hudson and Lee 1981; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1967; Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). The results of problem-oriented research can contribute substantially to an under standing of the ideational realm of prehistory as well as to more traditional concerns such as culture history. Such studies will serve to strengthen and justify the urgent need to record and preserve this vulnerable archaeological resource. REFERENCES Adovasio, J.
