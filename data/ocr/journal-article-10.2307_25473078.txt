<plain_text><page sequence="1">316 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 12 (APRIL 2007) J. DONALD HUGHES women warriors: the environment of myth HERE ARE TWO films that present variations on the themes of people and environment, tradition vs. modernity, myth and reality, and gender conflict. The Land Has Eyes and Whale Rider were made on Pacific islands by island people. In each, the lead is a young woman who connects with the founding myth of her own community and with the environment of land or sea, and draws strength from them for a contemporary battle on personal and social levels. Rotuma, a Polynesian island now part of Fiji, is the locale of The Land Has Eyes. Director Vilsoni Hereniko and the cast with two exceptions are Rotumans. The title comes from a Rotuman proverb expressing traditional justice: The land has eyes; The land has teeth And knows the truth. That is, in a conflict over land, the land itself can be trusted to decide and execute judgment. Viki, the 16-year-old protagonist, is acted by Sapeta Taito, a woman whose eyes make her worthy of the proverb. Her father, Hapati (Voi Fesaitu), keeps the old ways and tells her the story of the first person to come to the island, a woman raped and abandoned by her brothers, but who survived, gave birth, and became Warrior Woman (Rena Owen). Viki identifies with Warrior Woman. When Hapati is falsely accused by a neighbor of stealing coconuts from his land (coconuts yield copra, almost the only source of money income), he is taken before District Officer Clarke (James Davenport), representing colonial justice. Since Hapati cannot speak English and Clarke does not know Rotuman, the court translator Poto (John Fatiaki), in the neighbor's pay, frames Hapati, who is fined ten pounds, an amount beyond his means. Viki, who listened under the courtroom window, tells her father about the deception, but he refuses to appeal because, knowing the proverb, he trusts the land. His churchgoing wife asks him if he believes in the land more than Jesus. He says only, "I am Rotuman." Hapati encourages Viki to succeed in school. The teacher, who keeps a line, "Only the hard workers deserve success," on the blackboard, is quick to find fault, but is fair, and Viki is a hard worker, spending hours on homework. Before her father can pay his fine (he is generous to his relatives), he dies from fever. Viki runs to the sea and, diving under the waves, has a vision of Warrior Woman. Viki has nurtured a flower garden: another piece of land symbolism. She cuts it down and places the blossoms on her father's grave. Then she makes red feather fans after Warrior Woman's pattern, sells them, and pays Hapati's fine. She feels no joy, because, she tells her brother, "This proves our father was a thief." Viki places first in the school exam, which qualifies her for a high school scholarship in Fiji. J.

The committee, chaired by Clarke, includes island elders. During the hearing, Viki quotes the proverb, "The land has eyes." Poto mistranslates, inadvertently in a way that reveals Viki's father's innocence and predicts the manner of Poto's death. The elders, who know the proverb, are not misled, and the land uses its teeth in a spectacular way that opens Clarke's eyes to the truth. The Land Has Eyes was Fiji's official entry for the 2005 Academy Awards in the Foreign Language Film category. It was screened at film festivals, and the 2004 Festival of Pacific Arts in Palau. But it did not receive the run in U.S. art theaters that it deserved. Whale Riderwas widely distributed, and received notice when its lead, Maori actress Keisha Castle-Hughes, was nominated for the 2004 Academy Award for Actress in a Leading Role. At thirteen, she was the youngest actress ever to be so nominated. In Whale Rider, the environmental connection that dominates is with the sea. The setting and location is Whangara, a Maori village on the coast of New Zealand's North Island where the sound of the surf is ever-present. The traditions of the people, the Ngati Konohi, describe their descent from an ancestor, Paikea, who came ashore on a whale. Continuity of tradition is threatened, however, as the aging chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), must search for a worthy successor. His artist son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), refuses to stay in the village. Porourangi's wife died giving birth to twins, a boy and a girl. The boy also died, and Porourangi gives the girl the sacred name, "Pai" (Paikea), over the objections of Koro, who cannot entertain the thought of a woman being chief. Porourangi leaves Pai to be raised by Koro and his wife, Nanny</page><page sequence="3">318 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 12 (APRIL 2007) (Vicky Haughton). He returns after twelve years and meets Pai (Keisha Castle Hughes), an attractive and energetic girl. After arguing with Koro, who still hoped his son would become chief, Porourangi leaves with Pai. But as Pai looks out the car window at the sea of her home place (and hears the whales beneath the waves), she knows she must stay, and tells her father that her grandfather needs her. Koro decides to teach village boys in traditional skills and knowledge. He expects to find one who can pass difficult tests and prove worthy of becoming chief. As the boys assemble, Pai sits in the front row with them. Koro sends her away, but she secretly watches and listens to the instruction. The boys learn legends, chants, the haka challenge dance, and how to use the taiaha fighting stick. One boy, and Pai's uncle (once a taiaha champion), help her learn. But the boys all fail the final test: to dive and bring up the chief's whale tooth pendant, which Koro throws into the sea. Pai later retrieves it, but Nanny warns her not to tell Koro. Grieving her grandfather's failure to appreciate who she is, Pai sits by the shore and calls to the whales. This, it proves, is a power she has. Pai wins the leading role in her school pageant of Maori arts, dance, and song, and in a bid for Koro's approval, invites him to the event. The stubborn Koro decides late to go to the pageant, but on the way sees that a pod of sperm whales (the ones Pai has called) have beached themselves by the village. He stays with the whales, and Pai, heartbroken, finishes her part without her grandfather's presence. The village people do everything they can to pull the whales back into the sea, using a tractor, but the rope breaks and they give up. Alone, Pai climbs onto the leader whale and urges him back into the sea as the tide rises. The whale dives, and Pai comes close to drowning. When the people realize Pai is gone, Nanny gives Koro the whale's tooth pendant. Koro asks "Who?" Nanny will not tell him, but he knows. Almost too late, he recognizes how foolishly he has hidden the truth from himself. The film is based on a book of the same title by Witi Ihimaera published in New Zealand in 1987. This is a rare case where the film is better than the book (whose author puts anthropomorphic conversations into the mouths of whales). The Land Has Eyes and Whale Rider could be used together in an environmental history class, offering opportunities for comparison and discussion. Both will engage student interest, the dramatic and direct Whale Rider perhaps more so. The Land Has Eyes presents social and economic matters in a more complex way. Neither perpetuates the expected "South Pacific" stereotypes. But taken together they offer views by island people themselves of their relationship to the land and sea that comprise their environment. /.
