<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Art of the Solomon Islands", from the collection of the Barbier-Mul1er Museum by Deborah Waite. Geneva, 1983. 145pp., 35 colour plates, 131 black and white photographs; 2 maps, bibliogr., illustrated catalogue of the collection. Reviewed by Dorota Starzecka, reproduced from Tribus by kind permission of Ingrid Heermann, the editor. As stated in the introductory paragraphs, this book was intended as a catalogue accompanying an exhibition of objects from the Solomon Islands, including Santa Cruz, held in the Barbier-Muller Museum in Geneva in January 1983. At the same time its major purpose was to "reveal something or the cultural context tor wnicn tne artifacts were originally created". Consequently, it is divided into two main parts: the first provides a general cultural and historical background, the second is the catalogue sensu stricto. The first part consists of a General Introduction, containing mrormation aDout the history of the collection which was made almost entirely by Josef Muller, father of Mme Jean Paul Barbier, and by Jean Faul Barbier and wnicn is largely undocumented, and a very brief sketch of the history and culture of the Solomon Islands in which the mam emphasis is on religious beliers. inis is roilowed oy tnree secnons, eacn devoted to one major cultural and artistic region: the Northern Islands (Nissan, Buka, Bougainville), the Western Islands (Santa Isabel, Lhoiseui, New Georgia groupj, and the Eastern Islands and the Santa Cruz group. At the end is a section called Conclusions summing up the unifying characteristic features of, and diversity within, the Solomons art style. In each of the three sections a brief introductory text is followed by colour plates of selected objects from the collection, and black-and-wmte photographs providing a wider visual background for the objects shown in the plates. [η the catalogue part, which consists ot seventy entries, eacn object, illustrated and accompanied by basic information as to provenance, material, nistory, etc., is described in detail and discussed extensively, using relevant material from primary sources and comparisons with similar pieces in other collections. It is a lavishly produced book, which must be expensive and one cannot neip wondering at what type of reader it is aimed. For a layman, as a coffee-table introduction to the art of the Solomons, it provides easily accessioie geuemi background information, but its visual scope is limited, in fact the author herself warns on p.8 "... that in no sense should this be thought of as representative of all that was produced in the islands"; or sucn a reaaer rauiuguc ^ too detailed, for example, in providing numerous references to specimens in other</page><page sequence="2">. 50, collections, probably quite unfamiliar to the reader, and of marginal interest. For a specialist, the lavishness of the publication is slightly out of proportion to the importance of the collection, which, although good, is not outstanding, except for a few pieces, the most notable being the shell-inlaid wicker shield, No.16, the only one known with a complete human figure below the characteristic elongated central anthropomorphic image. The book's value is limited by poor documentation and the introductory text is too brief and superficial, although the main characteristics of the style are put succinctly. The main strength of the book lies partly in publication of a relatively little known collection, which is always welcome, but mainly in Dr Waite's annotations of the catalogue entries. These are extensive and well-researched, and in some cases they transform a simple catalogue entry into a small-scale compact essay, informative and illuminating; for example, the entry for the over-modelled human skull from New Georgia, No.12, or the clam shell plaque from the same area, No.23. Dr Waite's wide knowledge of the art, literature and archival material of the Solomons, as well as her familiarity with museum collections all over the world, are perfectly obvious here. This firm grasp of the sources is evident also in the very careful and valuable selection of black-and-white field photographs which show the objects illustrated in the colour plates in their cultural context, or elaborate on them in some way, introducing additional visual information; for example, a nice juxtaposition of the plate showing a wood staff decorated with a human head with shell-inlay pattern, and a photograph of a Simbo woman with a similar pattern painted on her face; or the plate of a spear next to a photograph of a warrior holding such a weapon and sheltering behind a large wood shield. In the text however, there are some For example, a seemingly interchangeable shell" (p.123, 138): reference to " ... things with which an ethnographer could quibble, use of "tortoise shell" (p.10, 46) and "turtle plaited fibres dyed red and yellow ..." (p.19), when the yellow is not dyed but is the natural colour of the orchid stem used in decorative plaiting: lack of a definition of the term kap-kap, when other non-English terms are explained; on p.54 and 124 a pump-drill - the only form known in Melanesia - is described as a bow-drill. There is also evidence of somewhat careless editing or proof-reading, which results in puzzling statements, as on p.10, about "... traders in tortoise shell and b£che-de-mer (pressed coconut) the Introduction mentions " over fifty artifacts" in the collection, Santa Cruz " ... represented only by three artifacts ...", when there are seventy objects listed in the catalogue, five of them (No.66 - 70) from Santa Cruz, although, admittedly, only three Santa Cruz objects are illustrated with colour plates. These, however, are minor matters. It is a book worth buying, for the catalogue annotations will be of lasting value to any museum curator or anybody dealing with Solomon Islands art and material culture.</page></plain_text>
