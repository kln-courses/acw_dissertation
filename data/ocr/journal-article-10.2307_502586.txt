EXCAVATIONS AT PITANE: Ekrem Akurgal, Univer- sity of Ankara. No abstract submitted. PICTURA COMPENDIARIA: G. Bagnani, University College, Toronto. It has been usual to combine a passage of Pliny H.N. 35 i io and one of Petronius Sat. 2. 9 and attrib- ute to Philoxenos of Eretria the discovery of a style of painting often called "Alexandrian Impressionism." We have no reason for supposing that by the word "compendiaria" the two authors refer to the same thing. Pliny is clearly alluding to innovations of tech- nique, Petronius is condemning a school of painting that, like Asianic rhetoric, treated an unreal and un- reasonable subject matter in a meretricious and flam- boyant style. This would seem applicable to the "Fourth Pompeian style" and Petronius would thus echo the condemnation of this style found in Vitruvius. Both authors derive from some Alexandrian critic writing not later than the end of the third century B.c. The same source was certainly used by Philo in the De Plantatione and probably by Horace in the Ars Poetica in which case it is possibly Neoptolemus of Parium. A BYZANTINE SHIPWRECK: UNDERWATER EXCAVA- TIONS AT YASSIADA, TURKEY: George F. Bass, The University Museum, Philadelphia. The University Museum began the excavation of a Byzantine ship which lay off Yassiada, near Bodrum (Halicarnassos), Turkey. One of the primary purposes of the work was to continue the development of scien- tific underwater excavating techniques. For this reason, most of the staff were specialists (archaeology students, draftsmen, photographers, an architect, and a medical doctor) who had learned to dive, rather than divers with no special talents for archaeology. Mechanical aids were devised which speeded drawn and photographic planning, and at the same time insured accuracy. An overall plan was made of the wreck, which lay on a slope running from 32 to 38 meters below sea level. This gives the position of the six iron anchors, the arrangement of the cargo of amphoras, and the position of the cabin, which was roofed with tiles. The cabin and adjacent areas were excavated to the level of the deck where planks and beams are well preserved. From here came a complete set of table ware, plain and glazed, cooking pots of terracotta and copper, a bronze chalice and a cross which was probably attached to its lid, a glass medallion, a set of inscribed weights, and eight lamps. Two scales, with chains and hooks attached, were uncovered; the larger was decorated with a lion's head and a boar's head at either end of the bar, and had as a counterweight a lead-filled bronze bust of Athena. Four gold coins from the time of Heraclius date the wreck to the first half of the seventh century. NETOS ON THE NESsos AMPHORA: Alan L. Boegehold, Brown University. A full report will appear in a later issue.</page><page sequence="2">1962] SIXTY-THIRD GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 195 THE CORRUPTIBLE CROWN: Oscar Broneer, Ameri- can School of Classical Studies, Athens. A full report will appear in a later issue. THE MORGANTINA EXCAVATIONS AND THE DATE OF THE ROMAN DENARIUS: T. V. Buttrey, Jr., Yale University. One of the salient features of the Morgantina excava- tions has been the discovery of a large number of coins in sealed deposits. Under the fallen roof-tiles of several buildings, destroyed in 214 or 211 B.c., has been found a complete group of the earliest Roman coinage of the denarius system: anonymous denarius, fractional silver (quinarii and sestertii), a twenty as gold piece of the Mars/Eagle series, and sextantal bronze. The material has been revealed consistently in several independent deposits. This archaeological evidence refutes both the conservative and the British chronologies for the intro- duction of the denarius (268 and i87 B.c. respectively), confirming the investigations of Thomsen whose forth- coming volume attributes the innovation to the Second Punic War. EXCAVATIONS AT KEA, I96I: John L. Caskey, Uni- versity of Cincinnati. On the promontory of Agia Irini, where soundings were made in i96o (AJA 65 [i96I] 187), three large areas and a further series of pits and trenches were opened this summer. The principal remains at this site belong to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. A much earlier site, at Kephala on the north coast of the island, was also examined. Walls of buildings were found immediately below the surface of the ground nearly everywhere at Agia Irini. Several complexes are of special interest. One is a large rectangular room, evidently a basement, with a square pier of masonry that may have supported the floor above. At either end of the room are doorways, one leading to a carefully constructed stairway, the other to a small compartment with a second flight of steps. The stonework throughout is of excellent quality. In a second area, not far away, there is a block of rooms forming an insula, surrounded by narrow streets. In this are two stone-paved lustral chambers with sluices leading out through the walls to covered drains. The rest of the ground floor is missing, but the basement rooms are well preserved in spite of the masses of debris that fell in when the upper storeys were thrown down by earthquakes. A flight of steps leads to the cel- lar level, part of which was used for storage. This stair- way had a landing at the ground floor, thence returning and going up to at least one higher floor. Pottery found in the ruins, including many imported pieces of L.M.- IA., L.M.IB, and L.H.II styles, indicates that the de- struction occurred before the end of the i5th century. The settlement was rebuilt thereafter. A few bits of walls and fragments of pottery and figurines of L.H.III types have been noted, but most remains of the later oc- cupation in the central areas have been lost by erosion. On lower ground to the southeast, near the present shoreline, a building of another kind was discovered. It is long and relatively narrow, divided at one place by a cross wall that contains a doorway. One room has benches along the side walls and a large stone podium in the main axis. The other, as yet only partly excavated, seems to be bordered by a corridor. Fragments of large terracotta statues were found in both rooms: two heads, an undraped right breast, parts of four arms, and other unidentified pieces. These are figures of female divini- ties or their attendants, and the building must be taken as a temple. Votive offerings recovered include a small bronze lion, a terracotta dolphin, a sealstone, and con- siderable quantities of pottery in late Mycenaean styles (IIIC). After the temple collapsed a much smaller shrine was installed within the ruins. A stone Blossom-bowl lay on its floor. Over this in turn were still later debris and parts of small structures, with scattered pottery in styles ranging from Protogeometric to late Classical. A re- markable terracotta button bears a representation of the head of Athena Parthenos in relief. Along the northern side of the settlement, enclosing the peninsula, are remains of a fortification wall in cyclopean masonry. Only a part of its length has been traced, and the evidence for its date has not yet been studied. Deep soundings in some places revealed walls and pottery assignable to the Middle Bronze Age. Frag- ments of two marble figurines of Early Cycladic types were found at Agia Irini. At Kephala there were traces of house walls and a few poor graves, all belonging ap- parently to an early phase of the Early Bronze Age. THE PURPORTED DECREE OF THEMISTOKLES AND SOME NEW CRITERIA FOR DATING: Sterling Dow, Har- vard University. A full report will appear in a later issue. EXCAVATIONS AT APHRODISIAS IN CARIA, 1961: Kenan T. Erim, New York University. The first campaign of excavations at Aphrodisias in Caria was undertaken by the Department of Classics of New York University under its Anatolian Research Project between July 8th and September 9th, i96i. The preliminary and most essential task of surveying and mapping the site was initiated. Lack of adequate ante- cedents in this respect will require a certain amount of time for the accurate and satisfactory completion of this work. During the present campaign, the precise topographic relationship of the chief visible monuments of the site was re-established and a contour map of the acropolis was completed. Excavations were undertaken at four points. At one of these, immediately outside the northern city walls, several fragments of handsome, life-size reliefs were</page><page sequence="3">196 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 66 discovered. They complement similar pieces found accidentally earlier and honor a certain Zoilos. Work was concentrated on the temple of Aphrodite, transformed into a Byzantine basilica. Interesting data concerning the temple as well as its conversion into a church were garnered. Frescoes were discovered along the central apse built at the eastern end of the ex- temple. Three trenches opened on the acropolis produced evidence, as yet not quite clear, about the pre-Hellen- istic past of Aphrodisias. A basilica of Roman date (probably 2nd-3rd cen- tury) was uncovered in the southeastern sector of the site. This also proved to have been transformed into a church at an undetermined time. The good condi- tion of some of its columns warranted the beginning of restoration and six of these were re-erected. Surface remains and indications point to the presence of a large complex of buildings of which the basilica is only one unit. ROMAN AND BYZANTINE COINS FOUND IN SCANDI- NAVIA: Joan Fagerlie, American Numismatic Society. More than eight hundred late Roman and Byzantine solidi which present several historical problems have been found thus far in Denmark and Sweden. The solidi, which most probably originated in Italy, are evidence of contact between Scandinavia and the South and it is extremely important to ascertain the nature of this contact, as well as the route by which the coins reached the North, and the reasons for the closing of the stream. A study of the duplicate dies present among the solidi has yielded information which has a direct bear- ing on some of these problems. Two ROMAN DOMES NEAR VITERBO: Alfred Frazer, American Academy in Rome. Two domed, octagonal halls from a complex of Roman baths of the imperial period found along the ancient via Cassia near modern Viterbo are of unusual interest both structurally and artistically. The "Michel- angelo Baths," published only in a watercolor view, probably date from the early third century A.D. The preserved octagon was covered by a two-staged dome; a lower zone in the form of a domical section trans- formed the octagonal ground plan into a circular ring from which rose the second stage, a less than semi- circular (?) crowning dome. This composite domical form over an octagon appears to be unique in the corpus of Roman domes. The monumental Bacucco Baths, published by a local antiquarian in I835, were perhaps a fourth century work. The octagonal hall was covered by a dome sup- ported visually by columns set in each corner. This dome may have been of the melon type, and if so, the monument provides a tangible parallel to the destroyed "Tempio di Siepe" in Campus Martius. However, the preserved fabric at least permits the consideration that it, too, was a two-staged dome. Both vaults illustrate the richness and diversity of solutions achieved by builders in the Roman domical tradition. Further inter- est is provided by the use of mosaic decoration to cover both the domical and the wall surfaces of both build- ings. In the Bacucco Baths mosaic covered certain architectural members as well. THE THEATER AT ISTHMIA: Elizabeth R. Gebhard, University of Chicago. Characteristic features of the Isthmian festival were music and poetry contests which were probably held in the theater. The site of a Roman theater was always visible but, during the 1954 campaign of the University of Chicago Isthmian excavation, remains of a Greek theater were revealed beneath. In the fall of 1959 and the spring of i96o the whole theater complex was laid bare: the lower part of the cavea, the orchestra, paro- doi, the scene-building with proskenion sill in situ, and a large irregular court behind the skene flanked by two entrance roads. The original Greek scene-building is of special inter- est because it was one of the first theaters to have a proskenion which was designed as an integral part of the building. Probably made of wood with rectangular piers, it furnished an elevated platform from which the performers could have sung and recited poetry. An underground drainage channel to carry off water from the orchestra yielded pottery by which the first period of the theater can be placed in the middle or latter part of the fourth century B.c. The proskenion was rebuilt in Hellenistic times and the whole theater underwent remodeling at least twice during the Roman period. In the most extensive rebuilding the court and entrance roads, terraces and storerooms, were added, the skene was enlarged, and a large addition was begun for the cavea. The anticipated participation of the Emperor Nero in the festival may have prompted this activity which was never completed. Hastily erected wooden seats may have accommodated the crowds who would have gathered in the theater to hear the emperor perform. EXCAVATION OF THE ROMAN THEATER, PETRA: 1961: Philip C. Hammond, Princeton Theological Seminary. The excavation of the main theater at Petra repre- sents one of the first applications of modern strati- graphic method to a provincial Roman theater in the Near East. Trenches were opened crossing the orches- tra and stage at right angles and along the orchestra diameter. The stage was also cleared following the completion of the main stratigraphic trenching. As a result of the 1961 season the stratigraphic history of the site has been established, the plan of the stage area and related substructure is known, as well as specific</page><page sequence="4">1962] SIXTY-THIRD GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 197 details of building technique and usage. The fall level of the scaena was isolated which will furnish chrono- logical data. Facing materials were uncovered which give indications of the important role of this particular theater. Inscribed fragments included pieces from the monumental inscription of the scaena, as well as col- umnar markings, which will be of interest in regard to Nabataean epigraphy at this period. A full-size Hera- kles statue was also brought to light. Another season is planned for 1962 in order to complete stratigraphic and restoration activities. EXCAVATIONS AT SARDIS, 1961: George M. A. Hanf- mann, Harvard University. The fourth campaign at Sardis brought interesting results for the Byzantine, Roman, Persian, and Lydian periods. A stretch of the main east-west thoroughfare of Sardis was uncovered. This wide, marble-paved avenue was flanked by colonnades with adjoining shops; its layout seems to go back to ca. A.D. 400. In the gymnasium complex adjoining the road to the north, progress was made in freeing most of the "Marble Court" with fagades dating to A.D. 211-212. New fragments of the Roman dedicatory inscription were found as well as of the Byzantine inscription deal- ing with a reconstruction of the 5th or 6th century A.D. At the sector "Pactolus North" remains of a bath of the 5th century A.D. have come to light, with well-pre- served hypocausts and mosaic floors. Remains of Achae- menid apsidal structures were freed in part of the sector. They include a remarkably preserved well. Lydian walls and again a well lie underneath. In the "Lydian Trench" of the "House of Bronzes" area more small shops and part of a larger building have been freed. Most of the structures were apparently destroyed in 499 B.c. but there is evidence that a bronze-casting establishment was active as late as the Hellenistic period. The first Lydian walls were found on the acropolis; otherwise, the remains of a large terraced building constitute the only architectural units pre- served on the central platform. These are Byzantine, and probably lasted, with modifications, from the Early through the Middle Byzantine eras. A painted vault of the 5th or 6th century A.D. as well as several sepul- chers of the Hellenistic and Lydian periods were in- vestigated. Among the abundant finds are the first pieces of Lydian jewelry, fragments of archaic terra- cotta reliefs, three graffiti in Carian language, and a splendid portrait of the 5th century A.D. The joint Harvard-Cornell expedition was again sponsored by the American Schools of Oriental Research. RECENT EXCAVATIONS IN THE TEMPLE OF INANNA AT NIPPUR: Donald P. Hansen, The Oriental Insti- tute. During 1960-i96i The Joint Expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the American Schools of Oriental Research undertook the seventh campaign of excavations at ancient Nippur, the Sumerian holy city, in southern Iraq. The cam- paign under the leadership of Mr. Richard C. Haines was again centered on the Temple of Inanna. In past seasons Levels I-VII (Parthian-Early Dynastic III/II) were completed, and in the present season Levels VII- XXI (Early Dynastic II-Early Protoliterate) were ex- cavated. Levels XII-XXI are Protoliterate and antedate the earliest temple of Inanna in the excavated area. For the most part the remains are walls of private houses. Levels VII-XI represent the Early Dynastic temples. The temple of Level VII is perhaps the most interesting and important. Architecturally it was complex, with a series of courtyards and dependent rooms leading to a double sanctuary. Large numbers of stone bowls, ritual objects, statues, and cuneiform texts were found in the temple. Some of these were found strewn about the floors of several rooms, but for the most part they came from hoards which were buried beneath the floors or else were buried beneath the mud plasterings of an altar or bench in one of the sanctuaries. A NEW ORPHEUS MOSAIC AT PTOLEMAIS IN CYRE- NAICA: R. Martin Harrison, Bryn Mawr College. A circular panel (1.50 m. diameter) in a square (sides 3-50 m.) is the central feature of a Roman mo- saic pavement recently uncovered in Ptolemais by the Cyrenaican Department of Antiquities. Within the circle Orpheus is shown facing, seated on a rock and holding the lyre on his left knee, his right hand poised to play; he wears the Phrygian cap and a long, dark red chlamys falling to the ankles, and he has a blue nimbus; his feet in yellow slippers are close together. Grouped above each other on the plain white back- ground are a lion, wolf and gazelle on the left, a leop- ard, bear, snake and mouse on the right. Surrounding the circle are four large and four small birds. The panel dates from the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century and is in many respects more advanced than the later wide range of Christian mosaics in Cyrenaica. The posture of Orpheus, the long chlamys and the nimbus suggest imperial imagery, and a comparison may be made with the silver missorium of Theodosius in Madrid. 53 Orpheus mosaics are known, but the nimbus in this context is unique. A DEITYLEss SACRIFICE IN THE ATHENIAN STATE CALENDAR: Robert Fisher Healey, S.J., Boston College. This paper deals with a curious and interesting feature in the revised Solonian Law Code of 4Io-399 B.c. The large Agora fragment (first published by J. H. Oliver in Hesperia 4 [I9351 5-23) preserves a portion of the official Athenian State Calendar of Sacri- fices, which formed a prominent part of the Code. Its third column contains a double series of sacrifices for an Eleusinian festival. Here, as throughout the Calen- dar, the sacrifices are regularly listed according to a</page><page sequence="5">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AIA 66 definite scheme: deity (with, or without, epithet) in the dative, victim in the nominative, price in the margin. In line 19 of the column, however, an entry of a pigling costing 3 drakhmai is made without any indi- cation as to the recipient deity. Attempts have been made to restore a deity either in the previous line or after the victim itself, in either case out of order. The explanation proposed in this paper is extremely simple, although not hitherto proposed. The pigling is not an offering to any particular deity, but is rather a preliminary purification offering for the temple and worshippers before the second series of sacrifices. Abundant parallels of such preliminary purification rites before important religious ceremonies can be cited. In almost every case the victim specified is a pigling. GREEK IMPERIAL MINTS AND ISSUES UNDER THE SEVERI: Tom B. Jones, University of Minnesota. The number of Greek imperial mints in operation during the reign of Septimius Severus was larger than at any other period during the principate. An analysis of the coins shows that, even in Greece, there were several distinct emissions between A.D. 193-211. Imperial military activities, travels, and anniversaries were com- memorated in the coins and afforded the principal occasions for their emission. IVoRY HORSE-TRAPPINGS FROM GonoRD N-196I: Ellen Kohler, University Museum, Philadelphia. During the 1961 campaign at Gordion a group of ivories came to light in the burnt fill of the Kimmerian destruction layer (early seventh century B.c.). These were found in an easterly room of the Terrace Build- ing in unmistakable association with two complete iron horse-bits. The cheek-pieces from the bits consist of racquet-shaped pieces containing single striding chimaerae (with winged female heads springing en face from their shoulder-blades). Other fragments from the same context have been assembled into parts of frontlets, and fragmentary plaques whose use is not yet known. The frontlets are triangular, decorated with a winged Hittite sun-disc across the top under which a winged nude woman in a polos holds up sphinxes by their hind feet. All the pieces are in high relief, delicately cut in the same style, and are equipped with fine holes for attachment to a background perhaps of leather. It seems to be significant that so many pieces of ivory and metal horse-trappings and chariot decoration from Anatolia and the Near East have representations of nude females, especially potniai ther6n, and that so many cheek-pieces have striding mythological animals. The closest comparative material appears to be from Nimrud, in the Fort Shalmaneser and Northwest Pal- ace collections, so that Nimrud's sources are probably Gordion's. Sincirli or Carchemish seem likely origins, where craftsmen were working for Late Hittite masters in the eighth century. These are the earliest imported ivories that Gordion has yielded to date and they form a firm link between Gordion and Syria for the pre- Kimmerian period. MEDIEVAL WALLS AT THERMOPYLAE: Pierre A. Mac- Kay, University of California. The more extensive accounts of the region around Thermopylae mention a number of traces of late fortifi- cation in the mountains above the pass. Study of these walls indicates that, in the panegyric "On the Buildings of Justinian," Procopius writes with a considerable sense of the topography of the region, and perhaps even some personal knowledge of it. The general picture he gives of the pass, and more particularly of the surrounding mountains, is not only valid for his own time but may serve as an aid to the understanding of the strategy of earlier campaigns fought around Thermopylae. THE DATING OF THE ITALIC "MEGARIAN" BOWLS IN THE LIGHT OF THE FINDINGS FROM COSA: Maria Teresa Moevs Marabini, American Academy in Rome. In 1951, in the northwest area of the Cosa Basilica, from the filling underlying the lowest floor, a half dozen fragments came to light, all belonging to that class of vases usually indicated as the "Popilius bowls," but for which the denomination of Italic "Megarian" seems preferable. The construction of the Basilica can be located with very close approximation in the years immediately following the middle of the 2nd century B.C. The most recent of the coins found in the same filling, a "denarius," can be dated ca. 160 B.c., the oldest, an "as," ca. 215 B.c. The stylistic discrepancy among the decorative systems exhibited by these frag- ments seems to be basically in agreement with this interval of time. Two fragments belonging to the same bowl claim, in fact, their source of inspiration in the type of "Megarian" leaf bowls of Attic manufacture dating probably from the third quarter of the 3rd cen- tury B.C. A fragment entirely covered with acanthus leaves in very strong relief closely recalls the "Me- garian" bowls from Pergamon; another, on the con- trary, anticipates the preference for the very superficial, almost linear way of decoration of the "Pergamene" relief bowls, whose beginning does not seem to be earlier than the middle of the 2nd century B.C. MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN HIGHWAYS: William A. McDonald, University of Minnesota. The paper will review the remains of built roads in Crete and the Peloponnese, particularly those reported by Evans between Knossos and the south coast and by Steffen in the Mycenae vicinity. New evidence will be presented for a major line of communication (dis- covered by the writer and Richard Hope Simpson)</page><page sequence="6">1962] SIXTY-THIRD GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 199 between the Bay of Navarino in western Messenia and the head of the Messenian gulf. Principal emphasis will be put on engineering techniques such as bridg- ing, draining, cutting, terracing, reducing grades, sur- mounting steep slopes. Attention will be paid to the meager evidence which the roads themselves provide for dating this monumental feature of late Bronze Age civilization. The relevant content of the Linear B tab- lets and representations of chariots and horses in fres- coes and glyptic art will be included. The question as to whether the horse-drawn chariot was first intro- duced into Crete or the mainland is important, since the innovation seems to have forced major improve- ments in trunk highways. On the evidence of the roads themselves the conventional view that chariots were first used on the mainland will be challenged. THE KNOTTED COLUMN IN BYZANTINE GREECE: George C. Miles, American Numismatic Society. The knotted column makes its appearance in Greece probably in the IIth century and continues into the I3th. Approximately 60 examples of this curious motif used both as architectural elements and in sculptured representations of niches framed by colonnettes have been recorded in some 25 different localities in Greece. Similar representations are to be found in many Byzan- tine manuscripts and in metal work mostly of the IIth and 12th centuries. The same phenomenon occurs in at least a dozen monuments in Italy and in a few localities in Anatolia. In this paper an illustrated sum- mary of the evidence is presented along with some observations with regard to the probable origin and symbolic meaning of the motif. EXCAVATIONS AT MYCENAE 1959-1961: George E. Mylonas, Washington University. The excavations in the Citadel of Mycenae, under the auspices of the Greek Archaeological Society, were concentrated on the north slope of the hill where in 1959 was located a stairway leading to the palace. In 1961 the ramp from its top to the NW propylon of the palace was revealed and two roads converging to its base were uncovered. One of these roads, the earliest in date, led from the direction of the Lion Gate; the other, the later in date, led from the Postern Gate. A number of platforms supported the stairway, its ramp and its roads, and these gave a monumental approach to the main entrance of the palace. In the section of the Lion Gate we were able to obtain from below the lowest course of the West Cyclopean Wall a sufficient quantity of sherds that place its construction, and consequently that of the Lion Gate, around the middle of the LH III B period. The exploration of the retain- ing wall of Circle A revealed again the earlier wall that was taken to be a mere footing. It is now proved to have belonged to the original circular wall that enclosed the area of the shaft graves; furthermore it is proved to belong to the closing years of the MH period, con- temporary with the oldest shaft grave. In 1959 our investigations of the ramp proved the existence of three earlier ramps below the present one. Then we were able to prove that the existing ramp is later than the rearrangement of Circle A and not contemporary, as believed heretofore. THE DATE OF THE SO-CALLED JASON: Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, Bryn Mawr College. Among the works attributed to Lysippos or to his pupils there is a statue of a youth tying his sandal, the so-called Jason, of which several copies are extant. The figure, with his right foot raised on a rock and his left arm resting on the right knee, has the typical three-dimensional stance usually connected with Ly- sippean sculptures, yet the pose is intelligible only when the statue is viewed from the front, because the depth of the composition is so reduced as to impart to the piece a relief-like quality. This eclectic use of Lysippean and pre-Lysippean principles can be found in other works, such as for instance the so-called Esquiline Polyhymnia, of the 2nd century B.c. The strong and detailed musculature of the Jason, as especially visible in the unfinished copy in Athens recalls the "flayed" anatomy of the Borghese Warrior, with which the Sandal-binder shares also the abrupt turn of the head. Both statues, moreover, imply an invisible second per- sonage and must therefore be classed as "genre" works. It is suggested that the Jason dates from the end of the 2nd century B.c., thus being a product of the Lysippean revival rather than of Lysippos himself or his school. THE ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT OF THE THEATER AT MORGANTINA: Lucy T. Shoe, Institute for Ad- vanced Study. The unique architectural moldings found in the theater at Morgantina have an interesting bearing on the forms which become the regular Sicilian koinon in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.c. They shed some light on the decorative forms in use in the Ionic colonies of Sicily and attest the strength of those Ionic traditions in the formation of the Sicilian Hellenistic style. Fur- ther, the archaism and originality of the Morgantina pieces are something more than these recognized Sicilian Greek characteristics; the unparalleled com- binations of profile and ornament coupled with the absence of normal elements of Greek orders suggest that the native Sikel tradition in Morgantina made itself felt even in so Greek a building as the theater. THE CAMPAIGN OF 1961 IN MORGANTINA, SICILY: Erik Sjoqvist, Princeton University. A full report appears elsewhere in this issue.</page><page sequence="7">200 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 66 THE COLUMN OF THE COSMOS: Elmer G. Suhr, University of Rochester. The cosmic column is one of the oldest and most fundamental concepts of the primitive mind. Perhaps inspired by the column or spout of water on the open sea, described by Pliny, it extends from the sun above to the earth below, comprising all the meteorological change of man's experience; the changes include that of the seasons and of the weather. Beginning with the sun and moon above, it functions as the meeting place for the emanations descending from on high and those rising from the earth, in fact the fertility of soil and organism as well as man's prosperity depended on the harmony established between these two forces. Above all, it was a symbol in motion, a whirling column which took on the form of a python or dragon, a churning stick, a cone, a structural doorpost and eventually a human figure crowned with a polos. The sun was represented by a disc, a wheel or a sun bird, the earth by the patient tortoise. Examples in the course of the column's evolution can be found in primitive Africa and Australia, in China, India, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete and Greece. In China it is the dragon reaching upward from the waters of the earth, in India the great stake used by Vishnu for the churning of the ocean. In Crete the column is whirled by the lion, the sphinx or griffon, two identical figures presented on each side of the column at times attached to it. Some of the older Greek divinities can be associated, in their aniconic form, with the functions of the column-Hermes, de- scending from the Olympian heights, Aphrodite, rising up from the foam of the sea, Poseidon and Eros who seem to have migrated from Crete to the older cult centers of the Greek mainland. Once they assumed anthropomorphic guise, they apparently carried along attributes which serve as clues to their earlier history and functions. ITINERANT TEMPLES OF ATTICA: Homer A. Thomp- son, Institute for Advanced Study. The excavation of the Athenian Agora has brought to light elements of a number of buildings of the classi- cal period which could not in their original state have stood in the Agora. The three examples discussed in this paper were all temples first erected in the 5th century B.c. in distant parts of Attica; all three were transplanted in whole or in part in the early Roman period to prominent positions in the Agora. The Temple of Ares mentioned by Pausanias (1.8.4) has long been known from its foundations and certain parts of its superstructure which came to light in the northwest part of the Agora. Mason's marks and pot- tery from beneath the foundations indicate that the building reached its present position in the time of Augustus. From epigraphic evidence there is good reason to believe that the temple and its altar originally stood at Acharnai, some 13 km. to the north of the Agora. A set of Doric columns which had been re-used in the porch of a temple of the Ist century after Christ at the southeast corner of the Agora is now known to derive from a temple of Demeter and Kore at Thori- kos, 40 km. by air to the southeast of the Agora. Several Ionic columns and a cornice block from the Temple of Athena at Sounion, 44 km. to the southeast, have been found in the Agora. These members appear to have been brought in to adorn the porch of another temple of the Ist century after Christ at the southwest corner of the Agora. Parts of all three temples were re-used once again in the late 3rd century after Christ in the so-called "Valerian Wall" along the east side of the Agora. The checkered careers of these buildings will illu- minate the history of Attica at more than one point. THE NAOPHOROI OF GREEK IMPERIAL COINS: Bluma L. Trell, New York University. In the much-debated question as to which of the ancient civilizations exercised the most influence on the art of the mediaeval west, Greek imperial coins offer a highly significant contribution. The types under study in this paper-issued in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire-provide the prototype of an ar- tistic convention well-known in mediaeval art, that is, the figure of a ruler, bishop, pope, or saint holding the model of a cathedral in his hand. But these coin types are also significant in the history of religion. Here too there is a problem of heritage. Unique in that they show a motif otherwise unknown in Graeco-Roman art, they clarify the meaning of a ritual for which we have scant or inconsistent literary evidence. A study of the history of the coin type-for the Graeco-Romans did not invent it--discloses a continuum of religio- social practices started in much earlier times-Hittite, Phoenician, Egyptian-and echoed in the later mediae- val west. Thus they serve as missing links, throwing light not only on the ritual of the Graeco-Romans but of the pre-Greek and mediaeval peoples as well. THE GREAT ANTONINE ALTAR AT EPHESUS: Cornelius C. Vermeule, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The foremost monument of Roman art in the Greek world still offers problems of purpose, arrangement, iconographic interpretation and possibly even date. The reliefs, with scenes glorifying the house of Trajan in the presence of gods and personifications of the Ephesian coast, were found by the Austrian excavators in three separate places, indicating dispersal in late antiquity or the Middle Ages. Most of the slabs had been set in the Library of Celsus, some as fronts for</page><page sequence="8">1962] SIXTY-THIRD GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 201 the water-fountain inserted in the Trajanic building. The original monument was an altar podium, modeled fairly closely on prototypes in the Hellenistic cities of western Asia Minor: Priene, Magnesia on the Maeander and especially the altar of Zeus Soter at Pergamon. The monument was conceived as a memorial to Hadrian's dynastic settlement early in A.D. 138, and it was executed just before or after his death later that year. As F. Eichler recognized, a key to the arrangement of scenes lies in the Greek guide letters on each slab; they ran from A to X. Another set, double letters, was on the orthostate frieze of bulls' heads and garlands, below the figured panels. Stylistic considerations join to indicate slabs A and X, an imperator (Hadrian or Celsus?) and Dea Roma Aeterna, were flanking the steps to the altar itself. The right side (B to H) is the "Side of Combat"; the rear follows (E to O, "Side of the Imperial Family"); and, finally, the left side (Tr to &lt;q) runs rear to front completing the counter-clock- wise circuit as the "Side of the Goddesses and Sac- rificants." How WAS THE PANAGYURISHTE GOLD PHIALE MADE ? Saul S. Weinberg, University of Missouri. While much has already been written about the hoard of nine gold vessels found at Panagyurishte in Bulgaria in December, 1949, relatively little attention has been given to the technique of their manufacture. They have been lumped together and said all to have been made by hammering gold sheets onto a mold. A recent opportunity to examine the vessels in the Plovdiv Museum has convinced me that while this was so for the seven rhyta and the amphora, all small- mouthed vases, a different method must have been used to make the open phiale. Since the interiors of all the other vessels were not meant to be seen, the hammering technique sufficed to work the gold into the mold, producing rich detail on the exterior but not on the interior. In the phiale, on the other hand, the interior is the exact reverse of the exterior in the most minute detail; this effect could not be produced by hammering. It would seem, rather, that a clay mold was made originally, using stamps for the three rows of negro heads and for the acorns in the innermost row. From this mold and an impression of it, metal molds must then have been made for both the interior and exterior. These must then have been arranged as a locked mold, similar to those used in making the coins of many cities of Magna Graecia. The sheet of gold from which the phiale was made may have been worked to some extent by hammering into one of the molds, preliminary to the use of both molds, but only by the final use of the two molds, locked into a fixed position and forced together, could the delicate detail of the interior as well as the exterior have been produced. MILLSTONES FROM MORGANTINA: Donald White, Princeton University. During its seven seasons of excavation at Morgantina, the Princeton University Expedition to Sicily has un- earthed a large number of ancient millstones. The various examples have been classified under four gen- eral headings, and represent a continuum of techno- logical development, beginning with the prehistoric phase of existence at Morgantina and ending with the close of civic life late in the first century B.C. A possible derivation for the rotary type of mill is suggested, but the examples from Morgantina, already beyond the prototypal stage, remain the earliest dated mills of this kind known. THE WooD TOMB CHAMBER OF THE LARGE GRAVE MOUND AT GORDION: Charles K. Williams, Uni- versity Museum, Philadelphia. The largest grave mound of Gordion was opened in the 1957 campaign, and by the 1961 season the wood tomb structure itself stood ready for examination. The area between the wood chamber and its encircling limestone wall had been sufficiently cleared of stone fill to reveal the details of construction of this Phrygian monument. The rectangular chamber is built of double wood walls, and with gabled roof supported by three trans- verse beams. This roof is protected by a second roof, made of logs. A limestone wall encloses this wood structure, and the space between wall and chamber had been packed with river stones. These river stones also covered the roof of the tomb chamber, over which the mound of earth was piled. In details the builders also indicated their knowledge of the problems of erecting a wood structure that would have to withstand the considerable weight of earth to be placed thereafter over the chamber. COMMAGENIAN TIARAs, ROYAL AND DIVINE: J. H. Young, The Johns Hopkins University. This paper describes and discusses four kinds of tiara represented on Commagenian sculpture and coin- age. These are: (a) the Persian tiara or kidaris, (b) the conical, pointed tiara, (c) the satrapal tiara, and (d) the Armenian tiara, familiar from the portraits of Tigranes of Armenia. The first type appears in three varieties, one worn by the Achaemenid kings shown at Nemrud Dagh, the second by Zeus Ahuramazda, the third by Apollo Mithra. The conical tiara is worn by the direct Persian ancestors of Antiochus I of Commagene, and appar- ently also by Heracles Artagnes. The satrapal tiara is probably worn by some of the Iranian ancestors. The Armenian tiara, in Commagene, is worn by Antio- chus I and by him alone.</page><page sequence="9">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 66 Once these types of headdress are clearly understood and their wearers determined, some important re- identifications become mandatory. Most important is the exchange of identities between two of the colossal statues at Nemrud Dagh. Puchstein identified the one as Antiochus I, the other as Apollo Mithra, and this identification has never been questioned, yet because of the tiaras worn by these two figures, the identifica- tions must now be reversed. By using this same method, other sculptures from Commagene can be correctly identified for the first time. NEw DISCOVERIES AT GORDION, 1961: Rodney S. Young, University Museum, Philadelphia.
