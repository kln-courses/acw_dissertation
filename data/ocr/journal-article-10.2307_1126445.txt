<plain_text><page sequence="1">SECONDARY SEX DEVELOPMENT IN MENTALLY DEFICIENT INDIVIDUALS 1,2 H. D. MOSIER and H. J. GROSSMAN University of California Medical School and H. F. DINGMAN* Pacific State Hospital Flory (8) reported that mentally deficient boys classified as idiots began secondary sex development significantly later than those classified as morons. It had earlier been shown by Terman et al. (23) that gifted boys reach puberty earlier than average boys. In order to define further the relation between IQ and the time of onset of secondary sex development, an institutionalized population of male and female Caucasians with mental deficiency has been examined. This report presents the results in the form of age-specific rates for the development of individual secondary sex characteristics in each of several diagnostic and IQ categories. These rates are compared with rates of development for normals when such data are available in the literature. Differences in rates of development of the sex characteristics among the diagnostic and IQ categories have been examined statistically for significance. METHOD During the summer of 1960, a series of measurements and other anthro- pometric data were recorded for 2472 mentally defective resident patients at Pacific State Hospital, a California state institution for the mentally deficient. The total resident population was 2808 at the time. Those not measured were unavailable due to illness or absence from their wards. Table I lists the items that were determined for each patient in the survey. * Population Movement Study, Pacific State Hospital, Box 100oo, Pomona, California. 1 Supported in part by California Department of Mental Hygiene Grant No. 59-14-13; in part by National Institute of Mental Health Grant No. OM-469, Data Processing in Mental Deficiency, Pacific State Hospital, Pomona, California; and in part by NIH Grant A-I71o.

Assuming that the percentage of each specific age group that possessed the secondary sex characteristic in question, as given by either Kinsey or Pryor, was the population value, the specific hypothesis under investigation was that the observed rate of onset of secondary sex character- istics of mental defectives was similar to the rate of onset of secondary sex characteristics in a normal population. Given the percentage of each age group in the normal population, the probability that the individuals in each age group would have the development rate observed was estimated using the National Bureau of Standards tables of the binomial distribution ('5). Then the probabilities for all age groups within each IQ and diagnostic category were summated using Fisher's formula (7, 9): X2 - -2 In P.

For the purposes of computation, when the proportion of the charac- teristic was either .oo or r.oo, the proportion .or or .99 was substituted. Otherwise, the computations would have produced unreasonable values. The effect of substituting .or and .99, as well as using the Fisher relationship for combining probabilities, tends to give an underestimate of the true statistical significance that could be expected in these data. Utilizing more 280</page><page sequence="9">MOSIER, GROSSMAN, and DINGMAN powerful tests, it is possible that somewhat more statistical significance could be achieved. Considering the small number of cases as presented in Table 2, it would be wiser, however, to repeat the study using a larger number of subjects or combine the data from another institution with the data from this institution and repeat the statistical comparisons. Table 3 shows that the delay in sex development in the lowest IQ group was always statistically significantly different from the normative data. In the middle IQ group, statistical significance at the i per cent level could not be shown for pubic hair in males. The same lack of significance in male pubic hair was seen in the highest IQ range. Here, also, the age of the menarche was less significantly different than in the lower IQ ranges. Con- sidering the diagnostic categories, pubic hair development tended to show the least significant differences when compared to normals although there were dissimilarities among the diagnostic categories. For example, female pubic hair development was significantly different in the familial-undiffer- entiated and mongoloid patients, whereas male pubic hair development was least significant in those categories. In general, however, the data indicate that the mentally retarded are significantly delayed in respect to the devel- opment of secondary sex characteristics. In Figure 5, the patients are divided into three age categories and the percentages possessing secondary sex characteristics are plotted according to IQ ranges and diagnostic categories. These charts show a fairly consistent delay in sex development in the lower IQ ranges. The fact that males tend to mature later than females probably accounts for the persistence of this trend through all three age ranges studied, whereas it is not apparent in the females i8 years and over. Females with mongolism showed the most strik- ing pattern of the diagnostic groups in that they were more delayed in the onset of sex features. This was most clearly evident in the 14 to 17 age range. When statistical methods are applied to these differences, statistical significance is obtained only in the diagnostic categories for the 14 to 17 year age range. The statistical test consisted of a calculation of the homo- geneity of a set of proportions having the secondary sex characteristics in common. The base proportion (or the base rate) was considered to be that rate exhibited by the total patient population, and variations within each age category were examined to see whether or not there would be over-all statistical significance. Again, the binomial distribution was utilized to evaluate the significance for each category and the probabilities were com- bined using Fisher's formula (7, 9, ri5) In this way, no attempt was made to single out a finding that looked as if it might be disproportionately large. The fact that only one of these items proved to be statistically significant is primarily due to the small number of cases that were available for exam- ination at each age level. As can be seen from Table 2, there were only i i patients in the io to 13 year age category for the group with IQs over 50. In order to have statistical significance based on the variations in a sample size of ii, there must be extremely large differences. Larger samples must 281</page><page sequence="10">CHILD DEVELOPMENT KI K lba 400 'tot &gt;004 1K 3 0' -k 24 c t o-I ow)~ 04 U, IL 0 4A. 04 444 z z S a aU ro: 4i %%' 0 0 64~ 7; a,- 0 0 on cv 0-'; 'X -j -i- * ,,, 64 o 9n 4-3 CTS Lbj 4L40~ O k*- L ?o Ol 0 0 0 0 0 N 3 1 1 282</page><page sequence="11">MOSIER, GROSSMAN, and DINGMAN be utilized to determine the statistical significance of the trends shown in Figure 5. It would probably be necessary to combine studies from many institutions and gather data from various sources to study effectively differ- ences in development rates in relation to these characteristics. DiscussIoN The age and pattern of secondary sex development in normal American children have been recorded by a number of workers:3 (i, 3, 4, 6, 0o, 12-14, 16-22, 24, 25). Shuttleworth presents perhaps the most complete graphic and pictorial summary of data on the development of secondary sex features (20, 21). Comparisons between those studies and the present study have limited value because no single report lists data on all the sex characteristics considered in this report. Furthermore, the various earlier studies have been done over a range of greater than a century, during which there have been progressive changes in norms in the population in the direction of greater somatic development and earlier appearance of secondary sex characteristics. In order to provide a normal curve for comparison with our data, we sought data which represented a fairly recent cross-section of the American population. It is our supposition that the data from Kinsey satisfy this requirement better than the other surveys cited in which the populations studied were often in higher social economic strata. Unfortunately, the Kinsey data did not include axillary hair and the results from Pryor were shown for this sex feature only in girls. The Kinsey and Pryor data differ more fundamentally in respect to the methods used to obtain them. The data from Pryor were obtained in a longitudinal study which consisted of examinations of a group of girls at six-month intervals through the onset of puberty. On the other hand, the Kinsey data were derived from interro- gation of adults about the time of onset of the specific secondary sex char- acteristics. Thus, the Kinsey data may have a bias which is due to the fact that in our society it is considered desirable to have an early sexual develop- ment and thus memory may not represent the exact date of onset. Similar data were not available for axillary hair or beard in boys. The findings in this study confirm those of Flory, showing that, the greater the degree of mental deficiency, the greater the retardation of sex development. Where his data concerned only boys, our data encompass both sexes and show essentially similar findings in males and females. This is shown in terms of percentages of individuals with sex development at each age range and thus do not show differences among individuals.

Statistical analysis of the rates of development of individual sex charac- teristics showed statistically significant differences between the normal sub- jects and the mentally retarded subjects on almost every characteristic in almost every category of the mentally retarded population. When compari- sons were made between the mentally retarded individuals, statistically sig- nificant differences were found only between the rates of development of axillary hair for girls between the ages of 14 and 17. The difference is obvi- ously due to the fact that mongoloid girls do not develop axillary hair at the same rate as the rest of the mentally retarded population. Other differ- ences between diagnostic categories and IQ categories, while promising, wait upon the collection of larger samples or the combining of sets of data from many sources. There is no explanation at present for the delay in sex development in groups with low IQ. Results of other aspects of this same survey have estab- lished that the mentally deficient population is shorter in stature than the normal population and that the lowest IQ range has the lowest average height. This is not correlated with length of institutionalization or other known factors such as illness or nutrition.4 It is possible that the same factors accounting for less linear growth are responsible for delayed sex development. There is no specific common denominator known at present save the mental deficiency itself. Linear growth and sex development are only two of many known somatic factors which are different in the mentally defective population as contrasted with the normal (5). At present, the various types of deficiency, except perhaps mongolism, do not seem to ac- count for dissimilar patterns of growth. It is conceivable that brain mal- functioning produces a disturbance in the hypothalamic-pituitary relation- ship which interferes with normal hormonal (e.g., somatotrophic) secre- tion. There are studies in progress into biochemical and hormonal charac- teristics of a group of exceptionally short patients at Pacific State Hospital in order to explore further organic aspects of stunted growth in mental deficiency. When one looks at the data in terms of diagnostic groups, it can be seen that there is a tendency toward delayed development in mongols of either sex, except breasts in females over the age of 18 years and sexual hair in males in the io to 13 and i8 to 21 age ranges. This pattern of sex development in the mongoloid group appears to be more scattered (see Figures 3 and 4) than that of other diagnostic categories. The most marked delay in mongoloid development occurs in axillary hair. Further examina- tion of this group shows a high proportion with what appears to be follicu- litis in the axillae. Unusual somatic hair distribution is also seen in some mature mongoloid individuals. Thus, factors other than sex hormone func- 4 Unpublished data (H. D. Mosier, H. J. Grossman, and H. F. Dingman). 284</page><page sequence="13">MOSIER, GROSSMAN, and DINGMAN tion may influence the hair pattern seen in this group. Other characteristics in the mongoloid patients, such as breast development and menses, may be influenced by factors other than simple delay in gonadal maturation. Since our data are machine-punched on IBM cards, it is possible to sort individuals with unusual combinations of sex features from the population. Data processing operations of this type have been carried out, and individ- uals with unusual combinations of sex features have been selected for further study. The results of one such study will appear in a subsequent report. SUMMARY A survey of the age incidence of secondary sex development in an insti- tutionalized population of mentally deficient males and females has shown that there is a tendency for a delay in the appearance of secondary sex features in the mentally retarded, when compared with a cross-section of the population as presented by Kinsey and Pryor. Differences within four diagnostic groups and three IQ groups of the mentally deficient patients were compared and found not to be statistically significant with the excep- tion of axillary hair for the mongoloid girls between 14 and 17 years of age.
