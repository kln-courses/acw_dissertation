<plain_text><page sequence="1">WIND AND WAVES, SACRIFICE AND TREACHERY: DIODOROS, APPIAN AND THE DEATH OF PALINURUS IN VERGIL In the time Vergil wrote the Aeneid and Diodoros was writing his Biblioteke, the memory of the civil war between Sextus and Octavian was still very fresh. The representations of death at sea in the Fifth and Sixth books of the Aeneid with the associations of Sicily, Palinurus, and the Naples area must in a suggestive and symbolic way be intended by Vergil to recall Roman naval tragedies in the past history of his people. In the case of Vergil there are very clear suggestions. For Diodoros, something of an inverse process should have been going on. While des cribing the Punic Wars, especially the First Punic War, a very vivid recollection of the civil war between Sextus and Octavian would have been present to him. In the case of Vergil, the tragic death of Palinurus off the promontory by the same name particularly symbolizes the wreck of the Roman fleet off this promontory during the First Punic War and the bitter naval struggle against Sextus Pompeius1. As the hostile anti-Pompeian propaganda put it, winds and waves and fortuna won his battles for him. But besides the losses to Octavius' fleet and the other tragedies of the Civil War, the memory of the disastrous aftermath in Sicily may be darkly hinted at in Vergil and Diodoros. 1 A shorter and less developed version of this article was given at the Convegno Interna zionale di Studi su Diodoro Siculo e la Storiografia Classica (Catania, Agira, 7-8 dicembre 1984). For the Palinurus scene with full bibliography, see my Unum pro multis caput: Myth. History, and Symbolic Imagery in Vergil's Palinurus Incident, ? Latomus ?, 43 (1984), pp. 776-801. The article draws particular attention to the similarity of descriptions in Appian of the wreck of Octavius' fleet (especially BC 5.90-91) to Palinurus' struggle, and to Sextus' assimilation of him self to Neptunus (Appian, BC 5. 100; see L. Cerfatjx-J. Tondriau, Le Culte des Souverains dans la Civilisation Greco-Romaine, Tournai 1957, p. 285). To the bibliography there one should add T. E. V. Pearce, The Tomb by the Sea: the History of a Motif, ? Latomus ?, 42 (1983), pp. 110-115. Pearce (pp. 111-112) cites important references in Apollonios of Rhodes: the tomb of Dolops (1.582-589), the hieron of Dipsakos (2.651-660), and the tomb of Sthenelos (2.911-929). The passages contain hints of inspiration for Vergil: 1.585, akte and tumbos are closely associated (in the plural, aktai probletes means projecting headlands and at 588 aktai is used); 586 the Argonauts must beach the ships because of ? back-blowing gusts of the wind ? (aV?[i.oio tza'.\i\itj:votr\aiv); the hieron of Dipsakos is just past the ? Black Promontory ? (Akie Melaine) (2.651). In terror, they observe the injunction of the seer Mopsos to pacify the psuche of Sthenelos with libations (and a holocaust on their own) (2.925-929). Per sephone sends up the shade, but unlike Palinurus, Sthenelos stands on his tomb, and explicitly the ? man of many tears ? (poludakros) only wanted to see his countrymen (2.915-917). Vergil's sense of guilt and expiation in the Palinurus scene contrasts with the Homeric and Apollonian models; and strangers or murderers, not friends and companions offer sacrifice and pour libations.

BRENK In the 23rd Book of his Bibliotheke, Diodoros, describing events of the First Punic War, relates the shipwreck of the Roman fleet returning from Panormos, a passage undoubtedly drawn from Polybios but slightly more vivid: ... crossing on the open sea to Rome, they again were shipwrecked as they were caught by a storm, so that they lost 150 warships and all the cavalry transports and booty (23.19). Hardly a passage to get excited about, and apparently nothing to do with Vergil or Palinurus. But now let us probe deeper. All devoted Roman readers of history would know that this disaster at sea occured in 253 BC off the promontory of Palinurus, huge jagged cliffs running perpendicular to the sea for a mile. More over, at the moment of the Palinurus tragedy in the Aeneid, Aeneas and his men are on their way from Sicily to Italy. But most important, in 36 BC the fleet of Octavius was devastated by the cliffs and rocks off the promontory of Palinurus leaving the fate of Sextus Pompeius in the balance for many months and causing despair in the camp of the future emperor. Unlike Polybios' account (1.39.1-6), that of Diodoros is immediately followed by a scene of avarice and treachery. The gatekeeper at Thermae betrays the city to the Roman officers; they in turn enter, but desiring all the booty for themselves order the doors to be closed behind them; through their greed they are slaughtered by the inhabitants. This may be an accidental juxtaposition, but the tone of it is exactly the same as that of Palinurus' narration of his encounter with the storm and then his death through the avarice and treachery of the natives. The difference in Vergil, however, is that Palinurus is innocent, while the natives are cruel, inhumane, and avaricious. In Vergil's unusual diction, which is so typical of him, the gens crudelis ?in their ignorance thought (me) (their) plunder ? (? ... praedamque ignara pu tasset?) (6.359, 361). The ambiguous phrase probably means ?in their ignorance thought I had something worth plundering ?, but is open to the suggestions ? swoop ing down on me as if I were some prey ?, or ?taking me to be a great prize ?. Sextus himself was denigrated to the status of a treacherous pirate chief. When the forces of Octavius won ? not because of his own efforts, which mostly ended in disaster, but through the military brilliance of Agrippa, it was through the army, not the navy. The aftermath of this war, the complete reduction of Sicily to an agricultural appendage of Rome, has now been amply documented in a recent archeological study. What is revealed is that Sicily was properous under Sextus and there is no evidence for dissatisfaction with his government, but that after Octavian conquered the island in 36 BC, the Sicilian cities were punished. This desolation appears both in literary sources and in the archeological evidence. The result was that between 36 and 32 BC the urban life of Republican Sicily had been destroyed, and that when the Augustan settlement of the island began in the years after Actium (31 BC) the result was a redefinition of its economy. No mention of revolt in Sicily appears even in authors hostile to Pompeius. Though the punishment is barely mentioned in the literary sources, archeology shows it was overwhelming and cruel. For example there is no evidence that the cemetery at Lipara was used for many years after the fateful dates. Leontinoi was ravaged. Large parts of Katane became part of an estate of Agrippa, and the city was later turned into a Roman colony. Morgantina was partially destroyed and vandalized. Thus the general tenor of life in Sicily was miserable after 36 BC. Sicily was desolate, and even Syracuse seems to have been punished. In Stone's view, Octavius was particularly savage since he probably</page><page sequence="3">DIODOROS, APPIAN AND THE DEATH OF PALINURUS IN VERGIL 71 feared a potential fifth column behind his back in the coming war against Antony. Only after the battle of Actium, did he proceed to the partial rebuilding of Sicily, but then a Sicily in a new, dependent role as the breadbasket (tameion) of Italy ? something Romans had striven for years to achieve. Under Sextus Pompeius the world had witnessed the final and tragic show of independence by the old Sicilian cities2. Very much the same conclusion was reached by G. Bejor, who, however, ac centuates the contrast between the repopulation of the rural centers after the war with Pompeius, and the decline of the cities3. The war itself, in his view, had directly negative effects on Sicily, since, with the markets in Italy closed, the Sicilian grain producers necessarily suffered. Though some cities after the war experienced re lative economic growth, virtually the only older centers to survive were ports on the coast. Finally, Bejor notes that under the empire the rural centers were no longer part of the orbit of local cities, but were under the domination of more flourishing urban centers. Sicily as a whole, in practice, was demoted to the status of a sub province in respect to nearby Africa with its emerging economic and cultural im portance4. In the view of many modern historians the primary source for this period was Asinius Pollio ? to whom Vergil dedicated the Fourth Eclogue, bitter and hostile to Sextus. Thus Sextus appears as a treacherous figure, aided by the blind natural forces of the sea, and by an equally blind and treacherous fortuna. At the end of the 5th Book of the Aeneid, Neptunus coolly demands from Venus a sacrifical life in return for the promise of a calm passage to Italy: unus erit tantum amissum quern gurgite quaeres; unum pro multis dabitur caput.' (5.814-815)5 In this account, Palinurus is then lulled by Somnus and falls headlong into the water, in vain calling upon his comrades. The second version, that in the Sixth Book ? combined with the first ? creates a strangely existential or structuralist approach to the event ? coincidentia oppositorum beloved by the human mind to express a thing's totality. For example, the rose, symbol of life and youth, through its association with funerals becomes identified with death and the underworld. The contradictory aspects of the rose, exploited by Vergil at the end of the Sixth Book, parallel the conflicting accounts of Palinurus' demise. In the second version he falls into the sea and is borne over it ? violently ? for three days and nights. Finally he comes to shore ? grasping with bent hand the harsh heads of a mountain ? (? presantemque uncis manibus capita aspera montis ?, 6.360). There a barbarous people run him through ? with a sword, in ignorance thinking him some great prize ?. There were Homeric precedents for the Palinurus incident, especially that of Odysseus' swim to the island of the Phaiakians. Vergil's scene in contrast is bitterly 2 S. C.

BRENK pessimistic, stressing night and darkness, the savage irrationality of the blind and impersonal natural elements which offer no aid, and the avaricious inhumanity of men, who murder the victim nature had spared. His language is harsh and gripping: tris Notus hibernas immensa per aequora noctes uexit me uiolentus aqua; ... (6.355-356) prensantemque uncis manibus capita aspera montis ferro inuasisset praedamque ignara putasset. (6.360-361) The whole scene is demythologized and detheologized in a type of Lucretian Epi cureanism. There are no longer any helpful anthropomorphic gods ? in contrast to the Ino-Leukothea who in gull form appears to save Odysseus in the Homeric model for the scene. Nor is there a basic feeling of divine providence and ?the part ordained for the whole ?that we might expect from a Stoic. Rather Palinurus is thrown out on a sea of blind, swirling, irrational elements in furious movement ? the type of ideological seascape that Lucretius loved. The themes of guilt and expiation assume more importance if the Sixth Book were composed or put into its present state before the Fifth6. Though not all the arguments offered recently are convincing, notable is the half line at 5.815 (? unum pro multis dabitur caput ?) lacking the final dactyl and spondee. Perhaps Vergil was struggling to complete the line without losing its ritualistic tone or the artistic significance of the truncated line. There is also the figure of the torn-off steering oar. In this recent reconstruction, the violent figure had first been composed for the storm of the Sixth book: ... gubernaculum multa ui forte reuulsum, (6.349)7 In contrast, that in 5.858-859 seems to be a later elaboration with more complicated diction, hysteron-proteron, and the ritualistic sounding repetition of cum heigh tening the figure: ... cum puppis parte reuulsa cumque gubernaclo ... The first would be realistic ? intended to portray the violence of the storm, the second unexpected, unrealistic, highly symbolic ? a gripping depiction of the helms man's devotion. However, one can add another note. In a sacrificial context two acts of violence occur, the ritual killing of the victim and the casting of the entrails into the sea. The selection of Palinurus by Neptunus reenacts in a non-violent way the first element. Hence, the added note of force in the casting of Palinurus into the sea ? by of all persons, Somnus ? reintroduces the violence missing in Neptunus' selection, while the two actions together constitute the essential aspects of the pro pitiatory sacrifice. 6 See T. Berres, Die Entstelmng der Aeneis. Hermes Einzeischriften, 45, Wiesbaden 1982, ? Palinurus ?, pp. 250-281, esp. 266-268. 7 349 ui forte] uix arte (A. v 270) P. One might argue that the type of formulaic variation which occurs in Homer happened here: ? ui forte reuulsum ? (6.349) became the more unusual ? (multa) uix arte reuulsus ? (5.270) (reuolsam R).</page><page sequence="5">DIODOROS, APPIAN AND THE DEATH OF PALINURUS IN VERGIL 73 Before sailing from Drepanum, Aeneas actually performs a lustration, ab breviated in its poetic form, but certainly meant to recall the famous lustrations of the Roman fleet: tris Eryci uitulos et Tempestatibus agnam caedere deinde iubet soluique ex ordine funem. ipse caput tonsae foliis euinctus oliuae stans procul in prora pateram tenet, extaque salsos proicit in fluctus ac uina liquentia fundit. (5.772-776) (772 agnos M; 776 porricit N. Heinsius). Here we have a double sacrifice, one to the Venus of Eryx, and the other to the ? Storms ? before the departure. In this abbreviated version, both the libations are poured and the sacrificial ? exta ? thrown into the sea from the prow of the ship. Judging by the ritual which speaks of several victims and on the basis of internal rhyme, ? agnos ? seems preferable to ? agnam ?. However, if ? agnam ? is correct, and Vergil intends the scene as a symbolic prelude to the death of Palinurus, the feminine form and the singular serve to heighten the individual aspect (? unum pro multis ?) and the innocence of the victim (Palinurus is ?insons?). Surely the ritual form ? proicit?, or even the ? proiecit? supplied by a corrector is to be pre ferred to ? porricit? given by some editors. This sacrificial scene stands only forty lines away from Neptunus' demand for ? unum pro multis caput?, and only eighty seven lines from the ?proiecit? of Somnus hurling Palinurus into the water. The importance of ? agnam ? (or possibly ? agnos ?) as indicating an innocent sacrificial victim is also suggested by a parallel to both the Aeneas propitiation and the death of Palinurus. At 5.235-238, Coanthus ? in Aeneas' regatta, part of the funeral games ? prays to ? di, quibus imperium est pelagi, quorum aequora curro ?. He promises to sacrifice a gleaming white bull (? candentem ... taurum) ? on the shore if the gods hear his prayer for victory in the race. Thus we find the important sacrificial killing on the shore (? in litore ?), the victim as a ? uoti reus ? ? language reflecting guilt or pollution in other contexts, ? extra ? thrown into the water, and the libation of wine (? uina liquentia fundam ?). The three passages make a nice parallel: ... extaque salsos proiciam in fluctus ac uina liquentia fundam. (5.237-238)8 ... extaque salsos proicit in fluctus ac uina liquentia fundit. (5.775-776) ... liquidas proiecit in undas praecipitem ... (5.859-860) To maintain parallelism, ? agnam ? rather than ? agnos ? seems preferable. We then move from bull (taurus), to lamb (agna), to Palinurus.

That line 5.238 should retain its repetitive, ritualistic quality, ac rather than et seems preferable. The ?liquidas ... undas ? is a variation on the two previous ? salsos . .. fluctus ? but cleverly picking up from the ? uina liquentia ?. Thus Vergil hints in the final passage, the sacrifice of Pa linurus, at both the ? exta ? thrown into the water and the missing libation. As so often in the Aeneid, his imagination and concentration on literary composition, contribute so much to the brilliance of the poetic technique. The fate of Palinurus as described by Vergil seems to echo the geography, events, and ideology of the war against Sextus Pompeius, which deserves review here. While the outcome of the war was desperately critical for Octavian, it was equally so for Sicily. Though economic changes inevitably might have led to the condition Sicily reached in the early Empire, still its favoritism toward Pompeius and his swift and crushing defeat led to reprisals and exploitation, which made a gradual transition toward Sicily's incorporation into the Roman Empire impos sible. The descriptions of the naval battles of the Civil War in Appian seem to be reflected in Vergil's portrayal of the death of Palinurus in the Sixth Book of the Aeneid. In particular for the defeat of Octavian in the straits of Messina (38 BC) one notes the emphasis on the violence of the wind (Notos, 5.88) and waves, the depth of darkness creating the horrible confusion of shipwrecks by night, sheer mountains near the sea, and survivors dashed against rocks and cliffs (Bellum Civile 5.84-90, esp. 89-90). The event had such a serious effect on Octavian, that according to Appian he fell into a state of depression and was afraid of a plot against his life (BC 5.91). An incident more closely related to the Palinurus scene in Vergil occurred in 36 BC off the promontory of Palinurus. Here the religious and ideological aspects of the struggle once more came into high relief. For the parting of the expedition Octavian chose the first of July, supposedly to honor and win the favor of Julius Caesar, after whom the month had recently been named. Perhaps, too, Romans were expected to be reminded of Caesar's devastating victories over Sextus' father. A grand ritual ceremony was enacted in which sacrifices were performed, including a prayer that the bad omens be turned against the victims (katharsia) instead of the fleet (BC 5.96). In Appian's description the priests, standing on the water's edge, have the animals killed for sacrifice. The altars themselves have been erected on the shore so that they touch the water. But then entering skiffs (skaphai) with the commanding officers, the priests carry the victims three times round the fleet gathered in front of the altars and pray that the bad omens (apaisia) be turned against the purificatory offerings (katharsia) instead of the fleet, while the host (leds) keep a religious silence (?7c?097][XS,l)9. Then the victims are divided and part is thrown away (&amp;tzop 9 See H. S. Versnel, Self-Sacrifice, Compensation and the Anonymous Gods, in O. Reverdin B. Grange (eds.), he Sacrifice dans VAntiquite, ?Entretiens sur l'Antiquite Classique ?, 27, Vandoeuvres-Geneve 1981, pp. 135-185. Versnel (Self-Sacrifice, pp. 159-160) gives examples of the unus pro omnibus motif, citing among other examples ? unum pro multis caput? (Aeneid, 5.815). However, none of his citations exactly parallels Vergil's line (e.g. Sophokles, Oidipous at Kolonos, 498-499; Euripides, Elektra, 1024-1026, Erechtheus, fr. 360 N2, 16-18). The closest Latin parallels are ? ut is patriae fata capite suo lueret ? (Valerius Maximus, 1.7.3) and ?... ut optimus quisque unum pro multis datum est caput ...? (Ps. Seneca, Epistola ad Paulum, 11</page><page sequence="7">DIODOROS, APPIAN AND THE DEATH OF PALINURUS IN VERGIL 75 piTCTOUtfi) into the sea and the another part is burned on the altars. Thus the ritual was analogous to that of the quinquennial lustration of the plebs in the Campus Martius, in which part of the victims was burned on the altar and another part was buried in the ground10. Appian's vocabulary (plethos, leds) actually suggests plebs. His word for the sacrifical victims (katharsia) does not exactly correspond to Greek technical vocabulary (katharmos, katharma)11. Appian uses kathaird (for lustro) ? not the normal word for religious purposes in earlier Greek, though the noun katharmos is frequent (e.g. Sophokles, Oidipous at Kolonos, 466)12. Thus Appian's katharsia may be the Greek equivalent of the Latin illuvies. Appian's description up to this point, however, seems totally in the nature of Greek purification and pharmakos practice. Vergil probably was not unaware of the Greek practice of throwing purificatory (pharmakos or scapegoat) victims into the sea. First, there is something of a model in Iliad 19.266-268. Here, apparently to remove the pollution (miasma ? though that word is not used) caused by the death-bringing strife between Agamemnon and Achilleus, a wild boar (already slain, however) is thrown into the sea13. More over, Strabon speaks of the Leukas ritual. During the festival of Apollo ? for apotropaic reasons ? a criminal was hurled from a rock into the sea. According to [12], ed. Barlow). But these may be Vergilian imitations. In any case Palinurus' sacrifice is not voluntary. However, the parallels underline the expiatory quality of Palinurus' death. For the sacrifice theme see R. Coleman, The Gods in the Aeneid, G&amp;R, 29 (1982), pp. 143-168, esp. 144 and 156; C. Bandera, Sacrificial Levels in Virgil's Aeneid, ? Arethusa ?, 14 (1981), pp. 217-239, esp. 224; A. M. Eckstein, Human Sacrifice and Fear of Military Disaster in Republican Rome, AJAH, 7 (1982), pp. 69-95, esp. 81-82; S. Farron, Aeneas' Human Sacrifice, ? Act. Class ?, 28 (1985), pp. 21-33, who notes accusations of human sacrifice against Augustus at Perusia (pp. 26-27) ? all pointing out the horror of human sacrifice in Roman thought. For Plutarch's condemnation of human sacrifice before the battle of Salamis (Themistokles, 13.2-5 == Phainias fr. 25 Wehrli) see A. Henrichs, Human Sacrifice in Greek Religion: Three Case Studies, ? En tretiens ?, 27, pp. 195-235, 208-212. See also P. R. Hardie, The Sacrifice of Iphigeneia: An Ex ample of 'Distribution' of a Lucretian Theme in Virgil, CQ, 34 (1984), pp. 406-412, esp. 412. There are some verbal parallels between Lucretius, 1. 84-101 and the Palinurus scenes (not discussed by Hardie), e.g. aras?aras, lacrimas?lacrimans, effundere?fundit, and the situations are rather similar (? exitus ut classi felix faustusque daretur?prosequitur surgens a puppi uentus euntis ?), but they do not seem conscious. For the importance in Augustan ideology of Aeneas-Augustus sacrificing see J.-L. Pomathios, Le Pouvoir Politique et sa Representation dans I'Eneide de Virgile, Brussels 1987, pp. 187-189. In 17 BC apparently for the first time non-bloody sacrifice was introduced for the Ludi Saeculares, following the practice at Delos. See J. Gage, Apollon Romain.

Latte, Romische Religionsgeschichte, Munich 1960, p. 119. Actually our evidence is slim. Appian, BC 5.401, is the major source for the lustration of the fleet. Latte cites Livy, 36.42.2 and 37.14.4, with reference to 29.27.5; but these texts offer little help. 11 On kathairo, katharma, katharmos, see the index in R. Parker, Miasma.

Bremmer, Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece, HSCP, 87 (1983), pp. 229-320, esp. 301, 316. Bremmer shows, however, that there is no real evidence for the human scapegoat being killed in historical Greece. 12 Parker, Miasma, p. 4. 13 On this see my review of Parker, ?

Vergil's choice of Phorbas, whose form Somnus assumes to approach Palinurus (a gratuitous choice since it did not appear in the Homeric model), can perhaps be clarified from a recent article15. At Ialysos and elsewhere on Rhodes, Phorbas was most likely honored with propitiatory sacrifice at the opening of the sailing season. In the Rhodian-Knidian saga he himself had been shipwrecked (with his sister Parthenia, near the Araiai, a group of islands between Knidos and Syme) but had landed safely and been treated hospitably by the local ruler, Thamneus. The island Levanzo on the west tip of Sicily, only about 10 kilometers from Drepanum (modern Trapani), Aeneas' point of departure to Italy, was known in classical times as Phor bantia16. It has been conjectured that Rhodian seafarers had established a Pkor banteion there, such as that at Athens. The rites for Phorbas at Rhodes might have included throwing the victim or part of it into the sea ? judging by the Roman analogy. If similar rites were performed on Phorbantia to assure good sailing, his introduction into the voyage from Sicily to Italy would be particularly apt. Phorbas would then be associated with Sicilian landscape and mythology, with propitiatory 14 Strabon, 10.2.9; Ampelius, 8; offscouring: Photios and Souda, s.v. peripsema (Bremmer, Scapegoat Rituals, p. 301, notes 15, 16). Ampelius, a 2nd-3rd Cent. AD writer, drew on Alexandrian sources, Nigidius Figulus, Varro, Nepos, and Trogus. Bremmer (p. 302) cites the ? romance ? of Iamboulos for scapegoats being set off to sea in boats (Diodoros, 2.55.3); but this writer, of whom nothing is known (but cited by Diodoros, 2.55-60) ? the author of a Reisefabulistik ? is to be used with caution. See A. H. McDonald, OCD, 1970, p. 53; G. Giangrande, 538. For Greek sources dealing with immortalization by leaping into the sea, see G. Nagy, Phaethon, Sappho's Phaon, and the White Rock of Leukas, HSCP, 77 (1973), pp. 137-177, and The Best of the Achaeans. Concepts of the Hero in Archaic Greek Poetry, Baltimore 1979, p. 203. Augustus built a temple at Dendur near Aswan to commemorate two brothers named Pahor, chosen by the Nile god Hapy for deification by drowning. Hadrian's deification of Antinoos follows this religious concept. See R. S. Bianchi, Augustus in Egypt, ? Archaeology ?, 31.5 (1978), pp. 4-11, esp. 6. Vergil's gloomy picture of Palinurus' fate is quite removed from this ideology. However, SHA, Hadrianus, 14.5-7 treats Antinoos' death by drowning as a form of devotio, see Versnel, Self-Sacrifice, p. 155, note 1 and p. 156, note 2. Versnel claims that virtually all the famous mythical persons who died through katapontismos received a hero cult, citing J.-P. Gttepin, The Tragic Paradox. Myth and Ritual in Greek Tragedy, Amsterdam 1968, pp. 92-99. But in Guepin's references hero-cult is not that clear. Confusion between a god and a mortal is present, and the most likely case, Ino. lives on as an immortal sea creature, not with the gods on Olympos. 15 On Phorbas see N. Robertson, The Ritual Background of the Erysichthon Story, AJP, 105 (1984), pp. 369-408, esp. 378-382. He cites (p. 378, note 22) W. Roscher, ML, 3.2 (1902-1909), pp. 2424-2430 and J. Schmidt, RE, 20 (1941), coll. 527-532, Phorbas, 1-13. To this can be added H. Von Geisau, Der Kleine Pauly, 4, Munich 1972, p. 808. The basic saga is Thessalian, hence wide distribution of legends. Robertson's argument (The Ritual Background, p. 379) for sacrifices at Rhodes to Phorbas at the beginning of the sailing season is somewhat round-about: an aition for ritual begging in the legend, evidence for ritual begging at the time of the sailing season on Rhodes (Diodoros, 5.58.4-5, etc.; Robertson, The Ritual Background, p. 379). The Phorbanteion at Athens was to an Athenianized version of Phorbas incorporated into the Theseus saga (The Ritual Background, p. 378). 16 A view of Levanzo (Phorbantia) from Mount Eryx shows its enormous geographical importance at Drepanum. See G. Monaco, La Sicilia di Virgilio, in E. Paratore (ed.), Itinerari Virgiliani, Milano 1981, p. 167, fig. 116; 172, fig. 117. The views of Palinuro, however, (p. 134, fig. 98; 135, fig. 99) are deceptive, since they show the harbor side. For epic purposes Vergil certainly imagined the horrendous stretch of cliffs dropping perpendicularly into the sea and extending a great distance on the south side. See also Castagnoli, Commentaires, pp. 203-204. In fact, though, Octavian's ships in 36 BC managed to round the promontory, only to be demolished on the harbor side when the wind changed. This mood is reflected somewhat in Vergil's Palinuran death by water.</page><page sequence="9">DIODOROS, APPIAN AND THE DEATH OF PALINURUS IN VERGIL 77 sacrifice before sailing, with falling into or swimming in the sea, and with propitiatory offerings after death. As with the Odyssean parallels, the Phorbas ones from the Rhodian saga are tinged with pessimistic irony. Unlike Phorbas, Palinurus will not be saved or re ceived hospitably by some kind host. Though Palinurus will obtain some sort of funeral honors, there is no suggestion of the permanent honor of a cult. His propi tiatory sacrifices like those of Phorbas will be apotropaic. However, his spirit must be placated in the face of present meteorological catastrophes, not as in the case of Phorbas, for the yearly assurance of fair weather before the season of smooth sailing. If Phorbas were indeed associated in local legend with Phorbantia ? and even more so if actual rites were performed there for fair sailing, this figure would become part of the blurring between mythological figures and marine landmarks. Such ambi valence characterizes the treatment of Palinurus, Caieta, and Misenus, who form part of an aetiological mythology so splendidly developed in the Sixth Book. The more subtle treatment of Phorbas might be a prelude to coming developments. Typically in Vergil not only Greek and Roman myth and ritual but also distant and contemporary levels of Roman history permeate each other in a context which is both past and present, real and symbolic. Undoubtedly Octavian's sacrifices ? if they can properly be called that ? were meant to recall those of Scipio Africanus at Lilybaeum in Sicily before the triumphal invasion of Africa in 204 BC. The event is depicted in Livy, 29.27.1-6. In a speech to the fleet Scipio prays to ? diui diuaeque qui maria terrasque colitis ?; then raw entrails are thrown into the sea (? Secundum has preces cruda exta caesa uictima, uti mos est, in mare proiecit tubaque signum dedit proficiscendi ?)17. They set off with a propitious wind, and though bothered by fog during two nights, when the morning of the third day disperses the fog, they see the whole African coast lying before them. The burning of the victims here may have been suppressed, but in any case the most spectacular part of the ritual seems to have been the throwing (? proiecit ?) of the entrails into the sea. This word, apparently prominent in the ritual, is repeated in the Palinurus incident of the Fifth Book. Palinurus does not fall into the sea. Rather Somnus hurls him (? ... cum puppis parte reuulsa/cumque gubemaclo liquidas proiecit in undas/praecipitem ?, 5.858-860). Since the ritual apparently prescribed throwing or hurling, not just dropping the sacrifical parts into the water, Vergil's usage is made clear, if ? as seems evident ? he was reproducing the sacrificial character of the scene. Every thing in the context before these lines suggests that Palinurus simply would fall silently into the waters, dropping off to first a momentary and then an eternal sleep in a watery tomb. Instead, the resistance of his unconscious body and the violence which is required for his passage into the waters is jarring and somewhat inexplicable without knowledge of the ritual background, even if the resistance of Palinurus' unconscious body conveys a strong impression of unswerving devotion to duty. In Appian's version (5.98), Octavian pours lustrations (not in 5.96, however) to Neptune and the ?Waveless Sea ?. Influenced by the Neptunus propaganda of Sextus, Appian may have incorrectly reproduced the ritual words used by Scipio and presumably used again by Octavian. The important element in all of this is Vergil's intimations of guilt, pollution, and the necessity of expiation. Thus in the death of Palinurus as represented in the 17 Livy, 29.27.5: ?exta cesarn uictimam A8iV4H ? (text of K. S. Conway-S. K. Johnson [OCT], Oxford 1934).</page><page sequence="10">78 F.E. BRENK Fifth Book, the dark and pessimistic side of Vergil appears again, as it did in the perilous situation of the shepherds, cowherds, and goatherds of the Eclogues and in the death of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Georgics, where in the guise of progress powerful forces or persons seem to triumph over the weak and innocent. Such de pictions suggest the tendency toward evil and weakness in all or certain human souls, with the consequent result of suffering and tragedy for the ingenuous persons who by destiny stand in the way. In the death of Palinurus Vergil hints with his technique of multilayered composition at violations in the divine and human spheres. Though the topos suggests a peaceful death ? the exhausted steersman falling into the sea on a quiet night ? we find new and disturbing elements in Vergil. Palinurus is wrenched away by Somnus and hurled into the sea ? a radical and contradictory element in the god's nature. One could think of the death of Sarpedon as depicted in the Iliad (16.684) where the hero is gently carried off to honorable burial by Hypnos and Thanatos (Somnus and Mors)18. The wrenching of Palinurus from the steering oar suggests the plucking of the Golden Bough in the Sixth Book, where resistance hints at partial violation of nature and the divine: corripit Aeneas extemplo auidusque refingit cunctantem ... (6.210-211) Similarly, in the Palinurus incident ? cum puppis parte reuulsa/cumque guber naclo ? suggests all is not perfect with the sacrifice. In sacrifice the victim should go freely without resistance. But unlike the Sixth Book with the plucking of the Golden Bough, which looks toward the future, Vergil here appears to be hinting at some thing dark and difficult to expiate in the past. When we ask what this guilt is ? dark and difficult to expiate ? we must turn again to mythical, historical, and contemporary references. On the mythical and symbolic level Vergil hints at Aeneas' guilt in the suicide of Dido, which caused the enmity between Carthaginians and Romans. For the past, one might think of the tragedy of Carthage in the Third Punic war with the massacre of the innocent there, a black page in Roman history for which the only justification Cicero could find was the irrational fear of his ancestors. But in the close vicinity of the Palinurus scene, with the departure from Sicily Vergil may be hinting as well at the tragedy of this island. It had treated Aeneas well, becoming his father's resting place. Here his father had been honorably buried and celebrated with games. But ? Octavian ? annihilated a popular ruler and his followers, many of them Sicilian, and ? Augus tus ? reduced it to humble subjugation. There are some hints that the civil struggle contributed to Diodoros' descrip tion of the First Punic War. Among them is his assertion (23.1) that Sicily is the noblest (Jcalliste) of islands, since it can contribute greatly to the expansion of empire (hegemonia), a statement which does not appear in Polybios. Throughout his des criptions of the war, Diodoros puts more emphasis on naval battles and naval di sasters for the Romans. For example, at 23.2 he relates in indirect discourse a discus sion between Carthaginians and Romans ? the Carthaginians contemptuously al 18 On this theme see C. Mainoldi, Sonno e morte in Grecia antica, in R. Raffaelli (ed.), Bappresentazioni delta morte, Urbino 1987, pp. 9-46, esp. 22-30.</page><page sequence="11">diodoros, appian and the death of palinurus in vergil 79 luding to their naval superiority which will prevent the Romans from crossing into Sicily, the Romans replying that they were pupils who always outstripped their masters. Throughout there is more emphasis on storms destroying the Roman fleet, than in Polybios, with more attention given to the details of the shipwreck (e.g. 23.11). The war is described as one which ? resolved itself in a series of naval battles in which the Romans and their allies lost a multitude of ships and no fewer than 100,000 men including those who perished by shipwreck ?. The aftermath of the Roman fleet's disaster off Camarina is very graphic: ? Bodies of men and beasts and wreckage lay strewn from Camarina as far as Pachynos ? (23.18.1). Diodoros at 24.3 notes how the sea before Lilybaeum again dashed the hopes of the Roman effort, and at 24.1.9, relates how the Romans lost all their ships ? off rocky shores and shallows ?. To Polybios' account of the shipwreck off Palinurus, Diodoros adds the loss of the transport ships and booty (Polybios 1.39; Diodoros 23.19). For the disastrous shipwreck of 255 BC off Camarina while M. Aemilius and Servius Fulvius were sailing from Aspis in Africa to Sicily, Polybios speaks of ?the greatest sea disaster in history ?. Only 80 out of 364 ships were saved, the rest des troyed at sea or dashed against the rocks. Later the commanders were blamed for sailing along the outer coast of Sicily, ?toward the Libyan sea? (%pbc; to Ai(Jux6v izzkoiyoq^ 1.37.4). Vergil's ? Libyco curso ? (6.338) in the Palinurus incident might be meant to recall this. Part of Livy is missing, but there is no reason why Livy would not have incorporated the event, possibly with speeches; and his account might have influenced Vergil. Recently it has been suggested again that the pessimistic endings of the Geor gics and Aeneid reflect Vergil's disillusionment with the new regime, primarily in the treatment of his friend and fellow poet, Cornelius Gallus19. But perhaps, too, the poet who so sensitively described the Sicilian landscape in the Eclogues was touched by the Augustan treatment which left it desolate. In any case, throughout his works Vergil's primary impulse, influenced as it wag by much of the greatest of classical literature, was the sympathy realized for human pathos and tragedy. One wonders what Diodoros must have thought if he had read or reread Vergil's Eclogues, written before the demise of Sicily. They were prophetically set in a never never Sicily, expressing the fate of contadini sfrattati (? ... Chaonias ... aquila ueniente columbas ?, IX. 13), who were in fact himself and his friends driven from their lands in northern Italy. But now the message could be applied literally to real Sicilian cowherds, goatherds, and shepherds, and to the townsmen who served them. Perhaps hidden deep in the verses of the Aeneid lie thoughts more humane than the official propaganda allowed toward Sicilia uicta20. And among the dark 19 H. Jacobson, Aristaeus, Orpheus, and the ?

Thought ?, 55 (1980), pp. 81-97. The golden age itself in Vergil has recently been treated by M. Pavan, s.v. aurea (AETAS, GENS; AUBEA SAECULA), in F. Della Corte (ed.), Enciclopedia Virgiliana, I, Rome 1984, pp. 412-418. 20 Though Vergil ignored Sicily in his Georgics, the island is very important to the Eclogues and the Aeneid. In Eclogues 4 the call for the return of the age of Saturn and the golden age (aetas aurea) begins: ? Sicelides Musae, paulo maiora canamus! ?. The melancholic 10th Eclogue in honor of Gallus (later forced to commit suicide by Augustus) shifts its tone with ?... carmina pastoris Siculi modulabor auena ?(51). Contentment with Sicily is suggested, too, by the abrupt ness of mood change in Aeneid, 1.34 as Iuno incites the storm before Carthage: ? uix e cons pectu Siculae telluri in altum ...? (1.34).
