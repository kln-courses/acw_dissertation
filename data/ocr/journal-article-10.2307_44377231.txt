<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elsie F. Mayer Title as Signature in Terry Tempest Williams's Refuge Elsie F. Mayer RESEMBLING A SIGNATURE THAT SETS THE KEY AND TEMPO of a musical work, Terry Tempest Williams's title of her memoir, Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place , provides a clue to its thematic import. Her attention to place, in this case the Great Salt Lake Basin in Utah, positions Refuge alongside other works of environmental nonfic- tion - Henry David Thoreau's Waiden , Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac, and Mary Austin's The Land of Little Rain - in which the writer's familiarity with the region is central to the work. The focus for Williams, however, encompasses both the natural habitat and its history, especially the dominant influence of the Mormons since they settled there in the nineteenth century. Hence, in defining place in Refuge, we must include not only its geographical features but also its deeply rooted social and religious traditions. The text of Refuge follows the stages of Williams's personal journey in the region she knows well. Two parallel narratives, both occurring in the 1980s, form its overarching structure: the abnormal rise and fall of the water level of Great Salt Lake and the death of Williams's mother, Diane Dixon Tempest, after a long struggle with cancer. Interrupting the narratives is Williams's attempt to come to terms with the effects of the rising lake on the environment and with the emotional pain caused by her mother's illness and death. The word in the title that piques our interest as readers is "unnatural." Imperative at the outset of any analysis of Refuge is that it be recognized as a memoir. Hence, Williams's choice of "unnatu- ral" is written in retrospect. As Williams reflects on past events and their impact on individuals and the environment, she judges the history of family and place to be unnatural - that is, out of character, a deviation from normal. In short, the word is judgmental. What prompts this judgment, I submit, is critical to understanding Williams's ecological view. We are also concerned with the title proper, Refuge. What is its significance in rela- tion to the circumstances Williams narrates, to the unnatural history of family and place? These are the questions this article attempts to answer. 46</page><page sequence="2">Critic 60.2 At the outset, it should be noted that Williams's view of nature is neither romantic nor idealized. Seeking explanations for the disruptive phenom- ena surrounding her, the flooding of the Bird Refuge and the rising elevation of the Great Salt Lake, Williams acknowledges the chaotic aspects of nature. Her memory of Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, which she has visited since childhood, reflects a benign and harmonious nature. Migratory birds come and go predictably, each species having its place in the environment. The river cleanses itself. In contrast, the flood at the Refuge and the rising water level of the Great Salt Lake demonstrate that nature is dangerous and unpredictable. This behavior of nature, antago- nistic to human needs and desire, is a humbling experience for Williams as an environmentalist. Reflecting on the unrelenting rise of the lake, she notes: "There is no one to blame, nothing to fight. No developer with a dream of condominiums. No toxic waste dump that would threaten the birds. . . . Only a simple natural phenomenon: the rise of Great Salt Lake" (140). Adjustment to a changing environment is the only option available to her. In his study of nature and technology, The Machine in the Garden , Leo Marx calls the presence of "images of machine technology" a counterforce to the idealized American pastoral (26). Tension between industrialization, or technology, and nature abounds throughout the country's literature of the nineteenth century, he maintains, but industrialization was then only a remote threat to a society in which agriculture was secure as an economic base. The imbalance between technology and nature was tilted in nature's favor. That the twentieth century has witnessed a shift in technology's favor, a shift so unrelenting that in the name of anthropomorphism it justifies the exploitation of nature, distresses Williams. What she perceives as unnatural and especially troublesome is the human response to nonhu- man creatures and their habitat. Examples of such a response abound throughout Refuge. There is steady human encroachment on the land. Burrowing owls, prairie dogs, and ferrets are threatened with extinction by the loss of the desert, their natural habitat. Marshes are declining because of the diversion of water from Bear River for irrigation and the backup of brine from Great Salt Lake during high- water periods . Excessive hunting and the rise in botulism also affect the health of the natural environment. Such conditions result from human behavior grown habitu- ally insensitive to the need for ecological balance. Evident here is a culture asserting mindless control over nature. The view that the p√Øanet exists for humans lies beyond questioning in the public mind. It is an absolute that admits no alternative. Although the interven- tion into nature's workings is instinctive even in primitive cultures, as Sherry Ortner has noted ("Is Female to Male As Nature Is to Culture?"), Williams finds the intervention by technology into modern society far too 47</page><page sequence="3">Elsie F. Mayer aggressive. Williams believes that technology has become a threat to human well-being because it has appropriated for itself superiority over nature. Insofar as a culture driven by technology perceives itself as superior to nature, it claims an exclusive right that precludes any reciprocity between culture and nature. Nature becomes objectified and is thus robbed of its potency to better the human condition. By favoring technology over nature, the former has become not a partner in environmental develop- ment but a threat to it. Thus, the ecological balance between human and nonhuman creatures is further disrupted. What accentuates the unnatural is the collective notion that technology has no limits in its capacity to satisfy human needs and desires. Humans, moreover, have relinquished their responsibility for parenting the earth by expecting technology to resolve their problems. Marx reminds us that Americans have harbored a "public passion for new technology" since they began to experience its benefits (208). It is generally held among contem- porary nature writers that science, which spawns technology, is valorized to the exclusion of alternatives, whether they emanate from intuition or environmental ethics. Advancing this position, Williams demonstrates that it is blind trust in public policy that promotes technology. In Refuge , when the Great Salt Lake rises to alarming heights, Utah approves the West Desert Pumping Project, which will divert its water through a three- hundred-foot opening, thereby releasing the overflow into the desert. Williams confronts her father, a construction engineer eager to be involved in the project, with the option of doing nothing, taking the position that the rise is cyclic. His reply: Political and economic realities forbid inaction. Politicians, industrialists, and technocrats win the day despite the fact that their solution is temporary. The corrosive effect of salt on the pumps will necessitate replacement in fifty years, thus increasing the already exorbi- tant cost. In the end, the project proves to be unnecessary. On the day of the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the lake recedes on its own. Despite the waste of human resources, the violence to the desert, and the cost to citizens, technology is praised for providing a hedge against a possible future disaster. More reprehensible for Williams is the U.S. government's policies on nuclear testing. Defending a nation at war in Korea and threatened by Communism, the government justified nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s, even though the consequences were a despoiled environment and human illness. After years, Williams eventually learns from her father that her recurring dream of a flashing light resulted from the detonation of an atomic bomb. He and her mother, then pregnant with Williams, witnessed the detonation on September 7, 1957, when they were driving north of Las Vegas. This and subsequent above-ground tests from January 27, 1951, through July 11, 1962, Williams knows, caused irrevocable damage to the 48</page><page sequence="4">Critic 60.2 environment: polluted soil and air that killed sheep and covered segments of population, children growing up drinking contaminated milk, and a large number of mastectomies. Nor have the effects of nuclear testing spared her family. Besides her mother, who is presently dying from cancer, there are the other women in the family who have had mastectomies. Considering them victims of a technological war, Williams refers to them as "the Clan of One-Breasted Women" (Refuge 283). After long reflection, Williams realizes that technology threatens the ecological bond between humans and nonhuman creatures. The birds' eggs she holds in her hand at the Utah Museum of Natural History, enough to repopulate a marsh, are intended for biological experimentation before it is discovered they are hollow. When she later asks Mimi the significance of hollow eggs, Mimi in her wisdom replies, "Earth is not well and neither are we." The response provides Williams with an insight: "I saw the health of the planet as our own" (263). Other insights emerge throughout this memoir. One, in particular, underscores Williams's theory that the human mistreatment of nonhuman creatures demonstrates deep-seated human perversion. In an early pas- sage, she narrates a visit to the municipal dump for the annual Christmas Bird Count. Sitting on piles of Hefties, she observes thousands of starlings at the dump. They are unpopular birds because of their aggressiveness toward other birds. Reflecting on their habits of feeding and flight, she realizes that the starlings drive other birds from the dump because their numbers have increased disproportionately. Furthermore, their monopoly of the dump has resulted in a loss of diversity. This loss is in itself unnatural, since nature is intrinsically diverse. Upon further reflection, the irony of human behavior strikes Williams. By generating piles of waste and destroy- ing the habitats of various birds, humans have created the habitat for the starlings they despise. She then draws a connection between the starlings and humans: "Perhaps we project on to starlings that which we deplore in ourselves: our numbers, our aggression, our greed, and our cruelty. Like starlings, humans are taking over the world" (56). Suggested here is the view that a misdirected collective psyche has allowed technology to drive society. Throughout Refuge , readers familiar with Thoreau will hear echoes of his fear that technology, if left unrestrained, will drive American society. The railroad, symbol of nineteenth-century technological progress, he observed, "rides upon us." For Williams, the threat of technology has intensified. A society that trusts technology to be the universal antidote to human ills endangers its own survival. In effect, her criticism of technology is leveled against the domination and mastery of nature, which, together with mechanization, as Carolyn Merchant notes, have become "core concepts of the modern world" (2). Humans, in their rush to control the 49</page><page sequence="5">Elsie F. Mayer environment, Williams reminds us, have forgotten their interrelatedness to other creatures. Her worldview, profoundly ethical, moves beyond the prevailing mechanistic view of nature, which allows humans to manipulate nonhuman creatures. In its place, she would have humans and nonhumans nurturing one another for the betterment of the ecological whole. Discussion of the Great Salt Lake Basin is incomplete without attention to the Mormons, who settled the area. A descendant of a family who traces its ancestry to the handcart companies that traversed the 1 ,200 miles from Illinois to Missouri, Williams finds much to praise in Mormonismi the courage and tenacity of the Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young to the area in 1847; the work of Lorenzo Snow, who in 1864 founded Bingham City on an ecological model; faith as the cornerstone of a community; and a technology that values the family, personal revelation, the presence of spirits in nature, and mysticism. Despite this high regard for traditional Mormonism, the religion does not escape Williams's critical eye. Through the insights wrought by modern feminism and her personal search for self- identity, Williams recognizes that its theology is androcentric and its organizational structure hierarchical and exclusive. As such, Mormonism participates in the unnatural and needs reform. Williams's reflections on Mormonism raise the issue of positionality. Humans are rooted in nature, but they also belong to a cultural construct. As cultural historians such as Lewis Mumford have documented, a crucial function of a culture is to develop symbols and systems, which in turn provide humans with meaning for their lives (Art and Technics). When a culture no longer fills this need, we conclude, it abandons a primary function, and its usefulness is diminished. Writing within the context of ecofeminism, Ortner notes that cultures distinguish between their opera- tion and nature's. They claim superiority over nature because they can transcend nature and transform it for their purposes. In effect, cultures "socialize" and "culturalize" nature (41). It is necessary to see Williams's questioning of Mormonism not merely as personal justification for distanc- ing herself from it but also as a query into its legitimacy as a cultural construct that claims the capacity to explain reality and justify its superior- ity over nature. As she re-examines the Mormon teachings and practices into which she was born, their inadequacies and the need for change become apparent to her. A concern for Williams in Refuge is that women are denied full participation in the Mormon church. Priesthood and positions of authority are open only to men. As a Mormon elder, for example, Williams's father is empowered to bless his dying wife. In contrast, women's blessing of one another is done privately and secretly because it is not legitimized by the Church. The Mormon teaching about marriage is especially troublesome 50</page><page sequence="6">Critic 60.2 for Williams. A woman's stature is enhanced through marriage to another Mormon. When Diane asks Williams, her daughter, about Williams's plans to raise a family, she has in mind more than the desire to have grandchil- dren. Mormonism teaches that a woman gains salvation through her husband, and her primary duty to her husband and the Church is to bear and rear children. Indeed, her respect in the community grows in propor- tion to the size of her family. Williams's ambivalent response to her mother challenges a fundamental Mormon teaching in the light of women's experience, for Williams's personal inclinations conflict with Mormon expectations.1 A survey of the Mormon Church reveals that is has sought and continues to provide opportunities for women to participate communally within the church.2 But Williams ignores these efforts in Refuge. Instead, she stresses that women's roles, defined by an exclusively male hierarchy, fall short of granting women full freedom and equality. She acknowledges that women have been complicit in creating rigid gender roles: By agreeing to the limited opportunities for self-development imposed on them, they have contributed to women's subjugation. In a conversation with her mother Diane and her grandmother Mimi, Williams realizes the price women have paid for the acceptance of their cultural role. They have traded the pursuit of greater self-knowledge for security. Change is necessary. But change demands relinquishing the security they have taken for granted, as her quotation from Auden makes clear: "Our dreams of safety must disappear" (273). Williams recognizes that Mormonism, a cultural construct, like nature possesses the right to human allegiance. Moreover, she attests to the complexity and interconnection of culture and nature. When circum- stances drive one to choose between the two, it is sometimes difficult to discern the course of action to follow or the intellectual position to espouse. Nevertheless, Williams is circumspect in her reflections on Mormonism and courageous in her decisions when her convictions conflict with its teachings. Thinking about Mormon teaching on the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, she asks, "Where is the Motherbody?" (240). That her question is radical is evident when understood in the context of Mormon theology, which teaches that the Father and the Son are "separate personages with separate bodies of flesh and bones." The Holy Ghost, in contrast, is "a personage of spirit without a body" (Whalen 93). Williams would enflesh that which has traditionally been perceived as a spirit. She challenges the Mormon theological view of the Divine, which valorizes the male gender over the female in explaining Its nature. She advocates revising this dogma, noting the need for a representation of the female in the "sacred triangle." She also calls us to rediscover the presence of an immanent God, a presence that seems undervalued in the contemporary 51</page><page sequence="7">Elsie F. Mayer Mormon Church. Divine transcendence has been stressed to the neglect of divine immanence. The concept of God's existing in close relationship with creatures, if not forgotten, has been neglected in Mormon teaching. Evidence of God's creative power exists in all creation - the nonhuman as well as the human. The loss of this awareness, so keenly experienced by Williams, leads to the human exploitation of the nonhuman in the name of progress. Implied in Williams's opinion is the charge that the Mormon Church, by neglecting this truth, contributes to the environmental crisis. Williams's quarrel with Mormon theology is twofold: The collective memory affirming the sacredness of nonhuman creation in Mormon teaching is fading. Like the culture at large, Mormonism has fallen under the spell of technological progress. Moreover, where change is needed, Mormonism remains inflexible. It favors a set of absolutes instead of a revision of its teachings, a revision necessitated by historical change. Yet Williams falls short of recommending that Mormon theology be revised or replaced. Having discovered the earth as a source of spiritual motherhood, she is content to be "a woman rewriting my genealogy" (241). Mormon ritual is also the object of Williams's criticism. Witnessing her mother's death after a long illness has dramatized death's inevitability. The acceptance of death into life, she learns, enriches life. As a daughter and caregiver, she needs to mourn her mother's death, but the Mormon funeral, by masking death, denies her the opportunity. The Mormon Church has gradually appropriated popular conventions into its tradi- tional ritual. In doing so, it has distracted its members from the real meaning of death. At her mother's funeral, Williams is forced to accept the cosmetic changes the mortician has made to her mother's ashen face despite Williams's earlier objections, and she attempts to wipe away the orange makeup with a rag soaked in turpentine. Her view of death as the end of the natural cycle is co-opted by a practice that disguises the reality of death. The makeup is reapplied to Diane's face because, as the mortician confesses, without it the standards for appearance would not be met. Although Williams experiences a measure of satisfaction as she and Mimi prepare Diane's body for burial as prescribed by the Mormon tradition, she weeps over "the hollowness of our rituals" (235). She laments that her family must hide its personal grief in order to assume the role of "public greeters." A ritual so sterile has lost its capacity to comfort the living. Williams sees the falsity of the modern funeral; what should be death- affirming has become death-denying. It is not surprising that after Mimi's death seven years later, Williams travels to Tepatzlan, Mexico, to partici- pate in the ritual D√≠a de los Muertos. By participating in prayer, carnival, and song with other mourners, she finally grieves the loss of her mother and experiences the meaning of death in a way the Mormon ritual had not 52</page><page sequence="8">Critic 60.2 provided. It can be said that the conflict between individual conscience and traditional teaching and practice, which stands as a challenge to modern Mormonism (Arrington and Bitton 288-89), drives Williams to distance herself from it. When that conscience has embraced the concept of ecological wholeness, the need to distance herself becomes a moral impera- tive. Throughout the memoir, Williams interweaves the details of place and human events. She keeps environmental perceptiveness alive by moving between the Great Salt Lake Basin and events both personal and public. In doing so, she deepens our sense of place, a quality Laurence Buell claims is essential to effective environmental nonfiction (266). But Refuge is also a cri de coeur recounted by a woman suffering from loss. Her mother dead, the ecological balance of nature threatened, and her spiritual center challenged, Williams depicts a world spinning off its axis. In such a world, identified in the title and supported in the text as unnatural, what is the significance of the word "refuge"? Where is the natural to be sought in a dysfunctional culture? To begin with, there is the natural habitat, the Bird Refuge, which eventually returns to normal after the water recedes. Here, as an ornitholo- gist, Williams observes the flock of avocets and stilts as pintails, mallards, and teals fly overhead. "Oh, blessed wings," she says with elation (275). But the Bird Refuge offers other opportunities. Here, as a daughter grieving her mother's death, she experiences nature's capacity to assuage human loss. Moreover, nature provides her with solitude for reflection. Her affirmation during this solitude: Life, like the migration of birds, is a "collective journey" (264). Not only does this perceptive analogy demon- strate a parallel between human and nonhuman creatures, but it also reaffirms life as an interconnected process in which all creatures participate and influence one another. It is worthy to note that Williams's text demonstrates Buell's observation about the role of the nonhuman in history. The nonhuman, he observes, functions "not merely as a framing device but as a presence that begins to suggest that human history is implicated in natural history" (7). In other words, humans and nonhumans are subsumed by a common ontology and participate in the ecological process of change from birth to death. As an environmental critic, Williams holds no illusions about the challenge before us. The world cannot be fled, for it is the arena of human action. Nor can ecological goals be met by returning to the preindustrialized view of nature. The tension between nature and its counterforce, technol- ogy, is a modern reality that must be faced. Like Thoreau, who eventually accepted the contribution of the railroad to the country's history, Williams accepts the inevitability of change that includes the effects of technology, 53</page><page sequence="9">Elsie F. Mayer but she emphasizes that humans must act responsibly in shaping the role technology will play in the future. In her later work Unspoken Hunger , she identifies "compassionate intelligence" as the underpinning for human responsibility. But refuge must be sought internally as well. Meditating on a lone heron on the shore of the receding Great Salt Lake, Williams comments, "Refuge is not a place outside myself' (Refuge 267). The discovery of internal refuge is imperative to healing oneself and the earth, as her experience demonstrates. Where is it to be found? Her answer is "memory": "Memory is the only way home," she writes at the beginning of the memoir (4). Presumably, here she has the act of writing the memoir in mind. The memoir, with few formal restraints, allows her to map freely the events, ideas, and impressions that will heal her personal pain. Its effect is regenerative. It also enables her to portray the past events that she treasures as reminders of her connection to the earth. The memory of standing with the dead rattler wrapped around her is a symbolic affirma- tion of their eternal kinship. They spring from the same initial energy, proof that the fates of the human and nonhuman are inextricably con- nected. The memory of the relationships among women holds special significance. As Williams listens to Diane's heartbeat, she experiences intimacy with another human, intimacy that leads to further reflection of breath itself as the common source of life. From her mentor, Mimi, she learns in her youth that "the world is one's own creation" (177), an existential view as well as an affirmation of trust in one's intuitions. Later, as Mimi lies dying of cancer, she advises Williams to claim her rightful freedom: "I am rid of the orthodoxy," Mimi says to her granddaughter. "My advice to you, dear, is do it consciously" (246). The memory of this moment erases self-doubt and reinforces the Tightness of Williams's actions. Finally, I submit that the word "refuge" has unique significance for Williams. An optimist, she continues to envision a world where opportu- nities for self-development abound and humans respect their connection to nonhuman creation. Behind the narrative voice is hope that her story can contribute to a change in attitudes, an essential step in establishing ecological balance. That change is possible she witnesses in the behavior of her father and brothers after Diane's death. Once avid hunters of deer, they no longer hunt, for they see Diane's face in the faces of the deer they meet in the wilderness. Change also appears in acts of resistance to exploitation. This realiza- tion drives Williams and nine other women from Utah to protest at the Nevada Test Site, a protest that leads to their arrest. Moreover, acts of resistance are complemented by expressions of advocacy. At a recent gathering of nature writers, the 1 996 Key West Literary Seminar, Williams 54</page><page sequence="10">Critic 60.2 agreed with those who argue that a book is a deed. In other words, a book is as much a legitimate means of advocacy as was the protest at the Nevada Test Site. In Williams's view, a book can raise human consciousness of the damage to the environment caused by uncontrolled technological forces and can lead us to a deeper understanding of ecological balance. To the question "Should nature writers champion their cause actively in society or on the printed page?" Williams responds that they should do both. To her credit, Williams does not advocate a set of uniform solutions to environmental problems. She recognizes that problems so complex will evoke a plurality of solutions. Hers is one woman's account of a personal journey. Other journeys will undoubtedly differ from hers. Also to her credit is that she chose the memoir as her literary form, for the memoir, akin to the story, invites us as readers to set aside theory and abstractions long enough to witness the truth of the experience. Refuge is Williams's story about relationships, and relationships cannot be theorized. They must be experienced. Storytelling, Williams believes, can change attitudes and move hearts, thus impelling human action. Notes 'For a discussion of Mormon teaching on marriage and the family, see William J. Whalen. Leonard J. Arrington and Davis Bitton discuss the family as the basic unit in the Mormon Church (294) and marriage as a lifetime commitment (303). The Relief Society, for example, offers women opportunities to participate in the Mormon Church through diversified programs. There is, in addition, the Salt Lake City General Retrenchment Society, a successor of the original Retrenchment Society, whose members met between 1870 and 1914 to study topics in psychology, politics, and theology. The current Retrenchment Society continues this tradition. See Arrington and Bitton (326). Works Cited Arrington, Leonard J., and Davis Bitton.
