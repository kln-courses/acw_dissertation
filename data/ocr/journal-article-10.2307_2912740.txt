<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modern Language Notes Volume XLIX FEBRUARY, 1934 Number 2 THE FRAMING-TALE1 When Chaucer decided to write a series of tales boxed in the frame of a Canterbury pilgrimage he essayed a form of literature already very ancient, though no previous writer had looked so far as he into the artistic possibilities of the type. The earliest series of boxed stories that we have is that of the Westear Papyrus, an ancient Egyptian document, which survives in a mutilated condi- tion but is sufficiently complete to make clear that it presents us with the literary form in question. The sons of King Khufu or Cheops tell each a tale of magic until one of them cries out that there lives a magician who surpasses those of whom the stories have been told. Accordingly the magician referred to is summoned by royal command and exhibits his powers in the royal presence. The papyrus belongs possibly to an age when the delineation of char- acter was unknown to literary art. Certainly, if we omit a few passages of primitive humor which describe the great age of the magician and his enormous voracity, a humor which is not for the modern adult reader, the entire interest of the document lies in its great antiquity, in the feats of magic described, and in the fact 1 This essay was originally intended as a chapter of a treatise on the Canterbury Tales. A draft of this treatise was completed about 1917, but I decided to lay the manuscript aside for five or ten years in order to revise it to better purpose. Unfortunately, I have since become in- tensely interested in other subjects, and my recollections of some matters are not so clear as I could wish. The essay is therefore presented with very little revision in the hope that, whatever may be its defects, it may justify itself in the eyes of the class of readers for whom it is intended. No attempt is made at a history of the framing tale, or at an inventory of such collections. I have merely tried to discuss a few examples of out- standing interest, and these from the point of view of literary art rather than of genetic connection. 69</page><page sequence="2">70 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBRUARY, 1934 that the author is using a literary device later used by Boccaccio and Chaucer. One would be glad indeed to recover the formula for laying bare the bottom of a lake in order to recover a lost jewel; or for making a crocodile of wax which will become a live one when thrown into the water but when picked up by the tail will again be a thing of wax. The reader recalls how Moses' rod became a serpent, and how he laid bare the bottom of the sea. And here the interest of most modern readers will probably end.2 But in India the collections of boxed tales were far more finished in their execution. They belong largely to the type of moral tale. The Panchatantra and the Hitopadesha tell fables about animals resembling the fables of Aesop; and are thickly sown with shrewd, and not infrequently with noble proverbs, for the coinage of which the highly reflective mind of the Hindu had a striking aptitude. As often as a jackal or a tortoise wishes to enforce his point he tells a fable to illustrate it, and in the secondary fable some animal will point a remark with yet another fable. The iitopadesha is a series of stories told by a renowned sage who has undertaken to enlighten the simple-minded sons of a prince. With amazing optimism he promises to do this in the space of six moons. Including this outer frame-work of the sage and the princes as the first story, we find that the Hitopadesha occasionally presents a story within a story within a story within a story; which may be conveniently expressed by saying that the story is sometimes involved to the fourth degree. The esteem in which we shall hold the literary art of the Hito- padesha will depend on whether our attention is directed to the boxing-process or to the fables which are thus boxed. The boxing evinces a perverse ingenuity. A fable clogs the action of the fable in which it is inserted to such a degree that perhaps only one who has learned the lHitopadesha by heart, as the Hindus and the Chi- nese habitually do learn books, will have a clear idea which story is resumed when another is finished. Somadeva, the author of the most extensive and involved of all collections of boxed stories in Sanskrit, declared that in weaving story into story he had not 2 On the Westcar Papyrus consult: Die Mdrchen des Papyrus Westcar.

But it is difficult for an occidental mind to conceive how the process could have even a mnemonic value. Regarded in themselves the animal-fables possess very consider- able interest. Real art is shown in the presentation of character, and along with much shrewd and pointed wisdom in the proverbs there is a truly interesting humor alike in the speeches and in the conduct of the animal-personages. It has often been remarked that in the Indian fables the animals speak not in character for the animals that they really are but like human beings. The imme- morial respect and indeed veneration of the Hindus for the lower animals rendered this for them a natural method. And no doubt the idea of a cat or a jackal professing pious practices, such as fast- ing and ablutions, is to the Hindu less amusing than to us. Never- theless the situations of the Hindu fable have their inevitable humor for all readers, and it is the professed purpose of the author to amuse while he instructs. The remark that the animals talk like human beings and not like animals should not be too rigidly construed. The fable-makers are not destitute of powers of obser- vation, and show a limited measure of fancy in fitting observed facts of animal life with anthropomorphic interpretations. I have already remarked that the sanguine philosopher of the Hitopadesha offers to educate the foolish princes in the short space of six moons. The tone of the book clearly implies that he is suc- cessful. This is a ludicrous exaggeration of the power of education to educate. If a man is really a fool a life-time will do little to edu- cate him. But further than this it is difficult to conceive how the recital of the brief fables of the Hitopadesha, thirty-four in number, could possibly have been spread over a period so long as even six moons. This period would more than suffice for a diligent stu- dent to learn the Sanskrit language and read the entire Hito- padesha in the original; whereas the princes and their teacher have their Sanskrit to start with. And the fables are recited at only four sittings, and anybody can read the whole book easily in an afternoon-in a translation. It is not that the fable-makers and collectors had that disregard of time which to our eyes seems spe- cifically oriental. Rather is it that in literary narrative time is, after all, a matter of very limited importance. The less we are re- minded of its passage the more vivid the illusion of the narrative.</page><page sequence="4">72 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBRUARY, 1934 An astonishing amount of labor and ingenuity has been wasted in the discussion how many days it took Chaucer's Pilgrims to go from Southwark to Canterbury-a discussion as futile as that of the so-called unity of time in the drama. Sometimes the frame of a series of tales is a real story; some- times it is merely a situation to which the author reverts as often as he finishes a tale. In the latter case all the stories are told by the same person and with the same purpose, and not infrequently this purpose is to delay action on the part of the listener. Thus the Sanskrit Seventy Tales by a Parrot are intended to delay a woman who is bent on a love-affair; and, in Arabian literature, Scheherazade tells the Arabian Nights in such an entertaining manner that her husband repeatedly defers his intention of putting her to death, and finally decides to let her live. In the Sankrit Twenty-Five Tales by a Vampire the stories are all told by the Vampire in; order to make the King speak and thereby undo a task which for reasons of magic must be accomplished in perfect silence. In collections of this description, greatly as the stories may vary in subject and character, there can, of course, be abso- lutely no thought of differentiating the tales according to the character of their respective narrators, or to the situation under which each story is told. For there is but one narrator, and a single situation, the situation which is repeated as often as the story is told. Furthermore, even in those collections where the stories are told by different persons, the adaptation of the tale to the character of the teller is scarcely attempted. Chaucer intro- duced a nearly new principle into the art of framing tales when he assigned romances to his Knight and his Squire, tales of low life to his Miller and his Reeve, and religious stories to his Prioress and his Second Nun. The boxed tales of the Hindus were translated into various lan- guages of India, and occur in Arabic, in Persian and in Syriac. Even in the far-off language of Mongolia there are extant three series of the type, with indications that yet a fourth, the so-called Seventy Tales by a Parrot once existed in this language.3 And so congenial did Hindu authors find the process of boxing or framing that we find it extensively practised in their epic poetry, as in the I See Julg, Monwgolische Mdrchensammlungen, Einleitung.</page><page sequence="5">THE FRAMING-TALE 73 Mahabharata. That the process was practised in epic poetry a thousand years earlier and more, in the Odyssey of the Greeks, seems never to have been correlated with the history of the framing- tale, and I may be pardoned therefore for dwelling at some length upon a matter so important. As a tale-framer Homer is the most interesting, and for Europe and America the most widely known of all the predecessors of Chaucer. There will undoubtedly be some who prefer the stories of the Decameron to the fairytales which Odysseus recites to Alcinous, but unquestionably the Odyssey presents the more artistic setting of one tale within another. Wilhelm Grimm collected some nine wonder-stories bearing each its striking resemblance to the story of Polyphemus. In all of these the hero saves his life by blinding a powerful enemy-a giant, an ogre or the devil. In five the enemy is a cannibal; in five he has but a single eye; in four the hero escapes by covering himself with the skin of a ram or of a sheep; in one he escapes the conse- quences of his deed by giving himself a pun-name, calling himself " Self " just as Odysseus said his name was OViT3t which means " Nobody." In another analog the hero hangs all night long from a hen perch, as Odysseus from the belly of the ram; in another the enemy throws stones at the hero's raft; and there are other re- semblances.4 Furthermore in Grimm's fairy-tales and in Somadeva's Hindu collection entitled " The Ocean of the Streams of Story" we have striking analogs to the story of Circe, the Hindu version knitting together features of the stories of Charybdis, of Nausicaa and Phaeacia, of Calypso and of Circe. " The hero of the tale, a Brah- man named Saktideva, is saved from a great whirlpool, like Ulysses, by climbing into the branches of a fig-tree which overhangs it. He is then carried through the air to the Golden City and is there entertained by the Vidyadhari (or fairy) queen who is destined to have a mortal for her husband. 'Many as are the noble Vidyad- haris that my father has proposed to me, I have refused them all, and am still a maiden' (like Nausicaa). But before a marriage 4 Since this was written Sir James Frazer has published as an appendix to his edition of Apollodorus in the Loeb Library, a collection of thirty- six variants of the story of Polyphemus. M1y attention has been called to this collection by my friend Professor A. M. Harmon.</page><page sequence="6">74 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBR-UARY, 1934 can be arranged Saktideva is suddenly conveyed back to his father's house, and marries his original love the princess Kanarekha." These illustrations make perfectly clear how closely the tales to Alcinous resemble the fairy-stories that circulate in the folk-lore of nations, but to conclude as has frequently been done, that they originally existed independently one of another; that they were originally told of nameless heroes and laid in nameless countries; and that they gradually gathered about the commanding person- ality of the resourceful Odysseus very much as in the Middle Ages all manner of tales gathered about the figures of Charlemagne or Alexander; and that Homer, by whom we mean the poet to whom the Odyssey owes its essential greatness, found them already in their places; this is unwarrantable. The stories collected by Soma- deva are not unlikely to contain matter directly descended from the Odyssey, and modified as it passed for centuries from mouth to mouth or from manuscript to manuscript. And the adventures of the Arabic sailor Sindbad contain one which so closely resembles the story of Polyphemus as to suggest that the Arabs did not so utterly disregard the imaginative literature of Greece as has fre- quently been represented. In fact we cannot be absolutely sure that the tales to Alcinous were not of the poet's own invention. And indeed the hypothesis that the tales in question, however they may have originated, were first associated with Odysseus by Homer himself, gains plausibility from the fact that the epic is elsewhere occupied with tale-boxing. Besides the stories of Odys- seus to Alcinous there are those of Nestor and Menelaus to Tele- machus, there is the song of Demodocus concerning Ares and Aphrodite, and there are the autobiographies exchanged by Odys- seus and the swineherd Eumaeus. Odysseus, while in disguise, tells yet other stories to explain his arrival in Ithaca. And when the ghosts tell Odysseus their histories, or the Old Man of the Sea tells Menelaus of the murder of Agamemnon, we actually reach involution to the third degree: a tale within a tale within a tale. The fact that the poet nowhere practices tale-framing merely for tale-framing, has generally obscured to students, whether of Greek or of other literatures, the fact that he is a remarkable tale-framer. He also exhibits an extraordinary skill. The result is no matter 5 Munro, Odyssey XIII-XXIV, p. 293.</page><page sequence="7">THE FRAMING-TALE 75 of mere ingenuity nor of mnemonic value, but of artistic beauty. The Odyssey does not wholly escape a charge of longueurs and tedious passages, but these are never due to the boxing of tale within tale. Indeed to readers not a few it is precisely in the stories to Alcinous that the poem reaches its supreme interest. And nowhere does one story, containing or contained, blur or impede another. Whatever the degree of involution, whether we have tale within tale, or tale within tale within tale, the narrative, framed or framing, is interesting and often intensely so. The perfunctory repetition of a mere situation, which we have seen to be a charac- teristic defect of Sanskrit method, is discreetly avoided. Only once is the long discourse of Odysseus to Alcinous interrupted, and then in the most natural and graceful way,-as if to make us aware that the Phaeacians are rapt in wonder as they listen,- without really breaking the thread of Odysseus' narrative. Nestor and Menelaus both receive Telemachus in their homes and tell him their adventures, but no third hero repeats the situation. And the accounts of Telemachus at Pylus and at Sparta are true pic- tures of travel, as varied as they are interesting and beautiful. To the question how far are the framed tales of the Odyssey adapted to the characters of the tellers, I fancy there will be no unanimous answer. The inserted stories are for the most part portions of the personal history of the tellers. The exceptions are the songs of Demodocus and a few mendacious stories told by Odysseus to fortify his disguise. The songs are suited to the pro- fession of the minstrel, the lies are suited to the wise man of an age when cunning was a large part of wisdom. On the other hand the long series of adventures in fairy-land occasionally seems to show that Odysseus was not originally their hero. In particular, it is not quite obviously like the prudent Odysseus to enter the cave of Polyphemus, and yet more fool-hardy for him thrice to taunt a giant who can throw so far. For the rest it is precisely in the Cyclops' den that Odysseus displays his greatest self-command, resourcefulness and cunning. Again Odysseus is a proverb for conjugal fidelity. What then of his relations with Circe and Calypso? Do these merely reflect an age when the highest fidelity was rude and imperfect or are they adventures originally belonging to another hero ? It is in the story told to Odysseus by the ghost of Agamemnon</page><page sequence="8">76 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBRUARY, 1934 that characterization of the kind we are seeking especially occurs. A brave warrior, an affectionate brother and a mighty paladin, Agamemnon is nevertheless too small a man for his high position. He becomes morose and vengeful when Calchas and Achilles oppose him; he is subject to panic and despair; the wounding of Menelaus calls forth a stream of mournful eloquence for which it is imme- diately shown that there is no cause. On the celebrated night of the supplications to Achilles, the night which Diomed and Odysseus spend in action, it is Agamemnon who most loses his self-command, who plucks his hair and wallows in discouragement. On several occasions he incurs a reprimand from one of his subordinates. That the treachery of Clytemnestra should inspire his ghost with bitterness toward all women is eminently like him. In fact no characters of the Odyssey speak and act more in character than the ghosts in the Eleventh Book. Antikleia, the mother of Odysseus, is an especially fine example. It is remarkable with how much womanly, maternal interest she is surrounded in a very few lines. The situation amid which Odysseus tells of his hair-breadth escapes is one of profound serenity and peace. After his last ship- wreck the wanderer is cast among a fairy-folk, the Phaeacians, gracious and hospitable. Perceiving that the stranger has suffered sorrows they make a united effort to infuse into his soul a portion of their contagious joy. Nausicaa, a thing of sweetest dignity and discretion, yet with eyes sparkling with the expectation of love, gives him his first welcome; and except for one little discord, with- out which the situation might seem unreal-it is a quarrel from which Odysseus emerges easily triumphant-all Phaeacia joins in an effort to charm every ache out of his soul. Then, exactly when it becomes appropriate that Odysseus should contribute to the entertainment of his host, he is made to tell his story. Boccaccio did not make the acquaintance of Homer till after he had finished the Decameron. It is therefore a striking coincidence that he made the frame to his tales, which is also their background, one of deep serenity. He assures us that his stories were in- tended for women. Bentley-heaven knows why-declared that the Odyssey was intended for women. The agony and desolation of the plague at Florence, from which Pampinea and the rest re- tire to the hills north and east of the city, intensifies the sense of comfort and repose which the story-tellers find in their secluded</page><page sequence="9">THE FRAMING-TALE 77 retreat, which is described with such particularity that scholars have been eager to identify it. Perhaps, too, the plague tends to explain, as a natural effect of the demoralizing sorrows from which they have fled, the excessive and unreal frequency with which Boc- caccio introduces tales of a licentious nature, some of them told even by the ladies. But whereas Nausicaa is no mere vision of lovely womanhood as it never existed but truly human, sweet, digni- fied and normal, and certain other Phaeacians are only less real and human, Boccaccio's seven ladies and three gentlemen belong very nearly to still life. They live, move and have their being only as do figures in a tapestry. Even the incident where the ladies, in a cool secluded spot, disrobe and bathe has less of animation and joy than many a picture. There is but one place where the setting of the Decameron be- tween tale and tale assumes the full character of narrative, and this is of course the quarrel between the servants Licisca and Tindaro, which is as if the spirit of Boccaccio's stories had overflowed into their setting, and besides relieving the monotony of the plan gives to the whole Decameron an air of unity which perfect separation of the tales from the setting could not have achieved. The effect of the setting as a whole, however, remains that of a background, dim, and unobstrusive. Dioneo alone of the ten narra- tors makes a distinct-by no means is it a striking-impression of individuality. M. Hauvette, indeed, discovers traces of the quality in a few others, but he does so by conscientious exploration, and I doubt whether his is not one of those illusions to which over-minute examinations are subject. The introductions and conclusions, the links between tale and tale of the Decameron are like the letters of a friend who has nothing to relate, but has confidence that be- tween friend and friend the mere lack of news is good news and welcome. Everybody is happy therefore there is no history to be told. There is a charm about these ten figures, scarcely any of whom can be called a character. We watch them as we might watch the costumes and decorous motions of a lawn party, without knowing who is who, or what he or she is like. The nature of this setting gives Boccaccio the widest possible freedom in the selection and assignment of the tales. Traces of an effort to fit the tale to the teller are at best faint and sporadic. Even the ladies tell tales that are licentious; even Dioneo tells two</page><page sequence="10">78 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBRUARY, 1934 that are not, one of them being the story of Griselda to which, indeed, he imparts a neo-pagan tone and an occasional comment of blunt common sense which Petrarch, for pietistic reasons, sup- pressed when he re-told the story after Boccaccio. Boccaccio is pre- occupied with other considerations than the character of his story- tellers, with considerations that may be classed as mathematical and structural; with mass, variety, proportion, symmetry and rhythm. No other collection of anything like the same number of framed tales gives such an effect of harmonious unity and whole- ness "Boccaccio," says M. Hauvette, "desired that his hundred tales should appear in a fixed order, capable of giving them a cer- tain cohesion, of introducing into them an element of variety, and of so contriving the pauses that their periodic return brings out the symmetry of the plan." 6 One thinks almost of the subtle and elusive irregularities which point and emphasize the unity of the Parthenon. Everywhere is the feeling for design that characterizes the races of the Mediterranean. It is worth observing that certain types of story included in the Canterbury Tales are absent from the Decameron. There is in the Italian collection no animal fable, like the Nun's Priest's Tale; neither is there any story that treats religion seriously and with respect, or that employs the supernatural except where the super- natural is due to magic. Neither does Boccaccio anywhere give us a homily in place of a story. The romantic, the tragic, the comic and the picaresque-these are the great notes to which the author confines himself. Friars and priests frequently occur, but they are almost invariably rascals. Says Mr. Hutton: " The only son of Saint Francis illumined with light and piety is the confessor of Ser Ciappelletto, and he has no name and is, I fear, quickly for- gotten." He is indeed a mere foil to set forth the amazing clever- ness and hypocrisy of the sinner whom he confesses and absolves." The omission of religious stories may be accounted for by the fact that it was not until long after writing the Decameron that Boc- caccio became a pietist; or it may be due to an artistic perception that stories of medieval saints would have sorted ill with a pleasure " Henri Hauvette, Boccace, ?Ptude Biographique et Litteraire, 1914, p. 212. 7 Edward Hutton, Giovanni Boccaccio, A Biographical Study, 1910, p. 309. 8 Decameron, First Day, First Story.</page><page sequence="11">THE FRAMING-TALE 79 excursion where the mirth was frequently broad, and where the romantic tales centered generally about that passion of love toward which ecclesiastical tradition showed the profoundest aversion. It cannot be shown that the omission of any fable concerning beasts or birds was deliberately artistic, though I cannot but think the inclusion of such matter would have discarded with the tone of the Decameron. Furthermore the Roman de Renard owes much of its color to its burlesque of the Chansons de Gestes. With these the Italy of Boccaccio was losing acquaintance. Neither does the Decameron anywhere exhibit the spirit of burlesque. "In Chaucer," says Mr. Hutton, the tales often weary us, but the tellers never do; in Boccaccio the tales never weary us, but the tellers always do." That the tellers in Boccaccio do not exactly weary us is solely due to the fact that they are used as a foil for the tales which are the real purport of the book. But even in the stories themselves action and situation are of vastly more account than the character of the personages. To describe a character of the Decameron you almost have to tell the story in which he ap- pears. There is rarely a portrait, or a description of costume or manner of life. Personages are rarely visualized. It is only in the dialogues that we are at all apt to see individuality delicately rendered, and dialogue is not at all prominent as an instrument of narration. The style of the Decameron is a remarkable achievement. The first commentator on Dante, and the first occidental man of letters since the dark ages to read either Homer or Tacitus, Boccaccio's personal history was of a nature to foster his natural instinct for style, and indeed in the Teseide style is almost the only merit. It is the weakness of Cicero, as he himself admitted, to be somewhat turgid and wordy, a defect which has frequently characterized modern Italian prose. It would therefore be unreasonable to ex- pect of Boccaccio, a diligent student of Cicero, the Attic simplicity of another school. The style of the Decameron is somewhat com- plicated, but fortunately the author had now learned to mingle the directness and point of good conversation with his more artificial graces. And the Decameron gives us a style such as is rarely found in European prose from the dark ages until the sixteenth century or later.9 It is immeasurably superior to the floridity of his early 9 There is a large body of excellent prose in Old Icelandic. The Welsh</page><page sequence="12">80 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES, FEBRUARY, 1934 work which fairly wallows in fine writing, and it is equally superior to the awkwardness of Chaucer's prose treatises. Indeed, this last circumstance is a powerful argument that Chaucer never read the Decameron, or at least never made himself intimate with it. That he knew none of the other collections of framed tales which I have discussed I take for granted. HENRY BARRETT IIINCKLEY New Haven, Conn. Mabinogion not infrequently has passages of peculiar beauty. But the merits of these monuments do not especially invite comparison with the prose of Boccaccio.
