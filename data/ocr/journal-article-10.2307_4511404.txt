<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature 1967 [253 included in Taverner's list, convincingly repudiated (p. 34) by means of careful examination of a single puzzling specimen, thus eliminating the continuation for great lengths of time of an easily made mistake, the bane of compilations of this kind. Crosby's colored illustrations are eminently successful. His birds are posed freely in n-atural and pleasing surroundings, showing in flight or in repose often two or three plumage phases of usually, very good coloring. Particularly helpful is the placing of the autumn warblers together with birds in spring plumage and in groups of very similar species, thus giving the reader excellent opportunities of intra- as well as interspecific comparisons. Plate 60, for instance, shows remark- ably well detailed plumages of the Connecticut (Oporornis agilis) and the Mourn- ing warblers (0. phitladelphia). The work is astonishingly clear of typographical errors. An inadvertent anthropomorphism appears oln page 230, where it is stated that the male Ruby- throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) does not take part in the "drudgery" of incubation and raising of the young. In the descriptionis of colors the habit of adding the qualifying ending "ish" (yellowish, whitish) is perhaps unnecessarily prevalent, and the presence and absence of hyphens (mixedwoods, mid-day, under parts) have me slightly puzzled. But the excellence of the work would scarcely be duly appreciated without negligible irregularities. Significantly, the book was consistently on the Canadian non-fiction best-seller list for at least three weeks after publication and still appears on it intermittently, testimonial enough not onily of its popular appeal but of its value as an attractive and scholarly work on the avifauna of Canada.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 44. A Life Time with the Birds. An Ornithological Logbook. Earle R. Greene. 1966. Edwards Bros., Inc., 2500 S. State St., Ann Arbor, Mich. 404 pp. $6. Earle Greene is a cordial, very friendly man who greatly enjoys birds and bird people. He has written a chatty, informal record of a life time largely concerned with these two subjects. Professionally he was Refuge Manager for the U. S. Biological Survey at Lake Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia, and at the Great White Heron and Key West Refuges in Florida. His bibliography, mainly concerned with birds of the southeastern states, runs to eight pages. His "Life List" of over 600 species seen in North America north of the Mexican border fills 28 pages; with each species are listed the states or provinces in which the birds were seen. There are 110 photographs in the book, some excellent, others rather indistinct. The volume closes with an index of the names of birds and persons. It is interesting to read of the nesting of exotics, originally escapees from aviaries, two species in California, six in Florida. In "Parakeet Village" on Treas- ure Island, not far from St. Petersburg, hundreds of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) have nested in freedom during the last five years. In a rookery of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) Mr. Carter Bundy of Miami introduced a number of eggs of the Scarlet Ibis (E. ruber) from Venezuela with the consequence that some of these gorgeous birds are now nesting in the rookery. After "retirement" in 1956 Mr. Greene is an enthusiastic as ever, driving over the couLntry, avid to visit his many friends and to see new birds for his life list. Let me quote: "When the average person reaches three score and ten years of age, he decides to take it easy, enjoy the rocking chair on the front porch or sit in his patio, read or look at television, or perhaps sleep the time away. Not so with the student of birds or one who has a serious passion on some subject vital to him. This person keeps on until he is called to the Happy Hunting Ground." May this good fate be the author's!-Margaret M. Nice. 45. The Birds of Tikal. Frank B. Smithe. 1966. The Natural History Press, Garden City, N. Y. 350 pp. $7.50. I have bee'n asked to review this ex- cellent new field book chiefly because my husband and I spent six months in 1965- 66 exploring and observing birds through central British Honduras and Peten, Guatemala. We made no collections but did some mistnetting. Later we joined C. Russell Mason, Mrs. Margeret Hundley and Sr. Jorge Ibarra (an outstanding naturalist in the country) for four days of intensive birding at Tikal, followed by four days of observations mostly by dugout canoe along the Rio de la Pasion in southwest Peten. Still later, in 1967, at Santa Elena on the shore of Lake Peten,</page></plain_text>
