<plain_text><page sequence="1">POPULAR SCIENCE THE CUCKOO By the Rev. E. A. ARMSTRONG, B.A. The cuckoo, in his mantle grey, Cries on all day through lush tree-tops, And verily - God shield me still I Well speeds my quill beneath the copse. (From the early Irish.) In the month of May it is a jolly thing to imitate the cuckoo's call and attract the bird to an adjacent tree where you may admire him and his call at your leisure. It is easily done. Clasp both hands together, making as large a space as possible between them, and blow between the thumb knuckles. There issues a mellow, rounded, deep-toned whistle which may be modified in pitch by lifting the palm of the right hand slightly and letting some of the air contained in the hollow of your hands escape. The result, if well done, is such a realistic imitation that even the wiliest cuckoo or field naturalist may be deceived. The notes may be modified to imitate the wood- pigeon and the brown owl. Wordsworth knew how it was done : There was a Boy ; ye knew him well, ye cliffs And islands of Winander ! - many a time, At evening, when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone, Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake ; And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, That they might answer him. - And they would shout Across the watery vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call, - with quivering peals, And long halloos, and screams and echoes loud Redoubled and redoubled ; concourse wild Of jocund din I I have often called a cuckoo in this way. Indeed, when out in the country of a May morning I can hardly resist having a 6 81</page><page sequence="2">82 SCIENCE PROGRESS little fun with the bird which loves to make a dupe of others. The remarkable thing is the precision with which a cuckoo can locate the call. He will come from a great distance and alight quite close to your place of concealment. And sometimes he will proceed to reiterate his call so endlessly that you cry, " Hold 1 Enough ! " and frighten the noisy creature away. If you are in a wood the bird will come dashing between the tree-trunks like a sparrow-hawk at an amazing speed. I remember particularly one calm, bright morning in May when I went early to bathe in a little tributary of the Cam. Those were great days when we would pull on running kit and, seizing a towel, dash out into the song-laden air, sharp and fragrant, run along the stream side to the consternation of the water-voles, and plunge into the still pool. Bliss it was those morns to be alive. But to be young was very heaven. After the dip one's senses were at their alertest and tuned to the highest appreciation of the fresh, fair world around. And while drying there was leisure to listen and enjoy. Sitting on the bank, I imitated a cuckoo, and, although I was quite in the open, he came flying in a wide circle overhead and perched, calling, on the nearest tree. Soon another joined up, and, continuing to mimic the birds, I made them accompany me back to college, and for as long as I had time to spare I had two frantic cuckoos flying swiftly back and forth before my study window. One of these birds which I heard calling at very close quarters made a clicking noise between the calls and erected its tail almost over its back in its excitement. The female is now known not to call " cuckoo " ; she has a reeling call not altogether unlike the ripple notes of the dabchick. The cuckoo is a strange bird and one never knows what strange things he - or more often she - may be found doing. I have seen the egg - a pale blue specimen of what would be called the " hedge-sparrow type " - in a linnet's nest on a turf bank on Texel Island, and I once knew a cuckoo lay twice in the same hedge-sparrow's nest. The second egg was laid in the ramshackle remains of the nest, which had been crushed out of all semblance by the sprawling young cuckoo which had fledged some days previously. I have no doubt, as the eggs resembled each other, that they were laid by the same cuckoo. Probably she was hard put to it and deposited the egg in the derelict nest faute de mieux. This observation raises interesting problems. Did the cuckoo remember the nest or had she kept it under observation and so knew it to be a nest ? Otherwise she might have laid the egg in any other bunch of grass and twigs. I have never noticed a record of this before,</page><page sequence="3">THE CUCKOO 83 but somewhat similar happenings have been recorded. J. H. Owen has known a cuckoo's egg to be laid in a linnet's nest which "had been robbed, and another in a whitethroat's nest only half-built,1 and R. Ware found a cuckoo's egg in a greenfinch's nest from which the eggs had been removed a week before." J. F. Green reports a cuckoo's egg laid in a hedge-sparrow's nest containing one egg which had been deserted three weeks,1 and E. G. B. Meade-Waldo records finding a cuckoo's egg in a nest from which the young wood-warblers had flown four days previously.4 In addition, there are many records of cuckoos laying in unsuitable nests such as those of the kestrel, green woodpecker, dabchick, and red grouse.' All this goes to show that the cuckoo is a bird whose vagaries may not be anticipated. It is dangerous, as some have done, to generalise about such a peculiar creature. There are some who maintain that the cuckoo always deposits her egg directly into the nest. On the other hand, there are convinced upholders of the doctrine that the bird sometimes carries the egg in her bill or throat and so places it in the nest. There can be no doubt that the bird sometimes lays directly in the nest, as the process has been closely observed and even recorded by the kinematograph.' Perhaps the most remarkable observation on record in this connection is that of Father Home, in a letter to Mr. B. W. Tucker, published in British Birds. He found a cuckoo laying in a nest on the sill of a staircase window. " I had a perfect view of the bird's body, which appeared to elongate and become pointed. This point was bent downwards, the bird standing above the nest and clear of it, and it almost seemed as though it felt about for the edge of the nest, for it moved from side to side. As soon as it touched the side of the nest, the egg began to be extruded, and when it finally left the bird it rolled to its place by the side of the other two eggs." ' The cuckoo settled on the nest for about a minute, and then flew away without looking at the nest. But does the cuckoo sometimes lay the egg and carry it in her throat and regurgitate it into the nest ? This belief has tradition behind it, though it may be that the sight of the cuckoo, as she may often be seen, with an egg in her bill, pursued by a pipit or some other bird, has given rise to the belief that the egg 1 British Birds Magazine, vol. 15, p. 210 ; also Kirkman's British Birds , vol. 2, p. 469 ; also Zoologist (1915), p. 355.

Chance. 7 Vol. 17, p. 215.</page><page sequence="4">84 SCIENCE PROGRESS was the cuckoo's and not, as it is now known to be, an egg which the cuckoo had stolen.1 Cuckoo's eggs have been found in covered nests into which they could only have been intro- duced, it is maintained, by means of the bird's beak.s To quote only one recent record : Miss E. L. Turner found a young cuckoo in a wagtail's nest in a flower-pot containing a plant of Hoya carnosa, the tendrils of which were very strong and close together. " It was obvious," she writes, " that the adult cuckoo must have clung to the pot, and inserted the egg into the nest with her bill." ' This testimony is particularly valuable as Miss Turner has photographed the cuckoo laying directly - sitting on the nest. My friend Mr. J. Beetham, of Doncaster, made an interesting observation which has not hitherto been published. In a letter to me he writes : " As far as I can remember it was the spring of 1906. I was out before breakfast and had found a wheatear's nest with eggs in an old rabbit burrow on the side of the sandy bank facing the railway at Rossington. I had passed the nest and had been examining what I thought might be a jay's nest in some small, bushy trees, and, when coming back, suddenly spotted a cuckoo flying low over the ground with something whiteish in its beak. It evidently did not see me, for it flew straight up to the wheatear's nest, settled a moment, and flew away in the opposite direction. I went straight to the nest and there was the cuckoo's egg - which I have now in my collection. I always remember this because it was the first cuckoo's egg I got and I know for certain the egg was not there when I examined the nest just previously." Perhaps the best evidence in this matter is that of Messrs. P. F. Bunyard and G. J. Scholey, who placed their records before the British Ornithologists' Club not long ago.4 Mr. Bunyard had waited nearly an hour on June 28th, 1927, in a hiding tent eight feet away from a reed-warbler's nest, when, at 5*50 p.m., he saw the cuckoo arrive at the nest with no egg in her bill. She disappeared, but Mr. Bunyard heard her " wh-ar " and " caught sight of her on my right, gently and slowly threading her way through the reeds towards the warb- ler's nest. Having safely reached it, she clung to the side, with her shoulders level with the top of the nest. Again there was no egg in her beak. She then thrust her head and neck into the nest, slightly withdrew, repeated the operation, and on 1 Aristotle, Hist . A nim., vol. 7. " The cuckoo lays in a nest which she has not herself built, but of some smaller bird, eating the eggs she finds there and leaving her own." 2 Dr. Jenner found a cuckoo's egg in a pied wagtail's nest in a hole under the eaves of a cottage. # Broadland Birds , p. 146. 4 Bunyard, P. F., Bull. Brit. Orn . Club, vol. 48, pp. 31-2, 1928.</page><page sequence="5">THE CUCKOO 8$ her withdrawing a second time I saw she had something in her beak. I gave her time to get away . . . then left the ť hide ' and made an immediate inspection of the nest, which I found, to my great satisfaction, now contained the cuckoo's egg and one warbler's (there had previously been two). The actual time she spent at the nest was not more than eight seconds. . . . She neither went on to or over the nest. Obviously the only possible way her egg could have reached its destination was by regurgitation." 1 The problem of how the cuckoo lays her egg is no new one ; it is discussed in an interesting little book called The Archi- tecture of Birds , published in 1831. The author quotes a passage from Vaillant 's Oiseaux ď Afrique which is sufficiently to the point to reproduce : "I always entertained the hope that I should one day surprise a female didric (Gilded Cuckoo, Cuculus amatus, Gmelin.) in the act of depositing its egg in the nest of another bird, but, having been disappointed in this respect, I began to imagine that my ignorance on this point would never be removed, when one day, having killed a female of this species and wishing to introduce into its throat a hempen stopper, according to my custom after bringing down a bird, in order to prevent the blood from staining the plumage, I was not a little surprised, on opening its bill for this purpose, to find in its throat an entire egg, which I knew immediately, from its form, size, and beautiful whiteness, to belong to the didric. Delighted at length, after so many useless efforts, at having obtained a confirmation of my suspicions, I loudly called my faithful Klaas, who was only a few paces distant from me, to whom I imparted my discovery with much pleasure, as he had used his best exertions to second my views. Klaas, on seeing the egg in the bird's gullet, told me that, after killing female cuckoos, he had frequently observed a newly-broken egg lying upon the ground near where they had fallen, which, he supposed, they had dropped in their fall, from being at that moment ready to lay. I recollect very well that when this good Hottentot brought me the fruits of his sports, he frequently remarked, as he pointed to the cuckoo, 1 This one laid her egg as she fell from the tree.' Although I was convinced, from this circumstance, that the female cuckoo deposits her egg in the nests of other birds by conveying it in her beak, I was very desirous to collect what facts I could upon the subject. Klaas and I therefore began to shoot as many cuckoos as we could meet with, which accounts for the great numbers of this species we procured. (130 females). However, among all the specimens 1 Cf. also British Birds Magazine , vol. 15, pp. 130-86. G. J. Scholey, in this article, writes of the cuckoo " that she carried it (the egg) to the nest in her bill I have no doubt."</page><page sequence="6">86 SCIENCE PROGRESS there occurred only one instance similar to that which I have just mentioned - that, namely, of a second female who was transporting her egg in her mouth, like the former.' ' 1 Perhaps those are wisest who withhold judgment until irresistible evidence is forthcoming. As old Sir Thomas Ware wrote, after discussing whether or not the Barnacle goose is generated from shell-fish : " In a matter that may deserve further search, I determin nothing. " In spite of the appa- rently purposive actions of birds we are learning that their behaviour is less due to intelligence and emotion than we would at first imagine.8 Instinct and reflex action account for a great deal in animal (and, indeed, also human) behaviour. Are we to believe that a female cuckoo can come so close to reasonable behaviour as would be required of her in depositing her egg in a covered nest with her bill ? Think what it involves : inspec- tion of the nest and realisation that the egg cannot be directly deposited ; extrusion of the egg on the ground and recognition of it as what it is ; inhibition of the impulse to crush it ; retention until a suitable opportunity occurs, and the feat of regurgitating it while clinging in an awkward position. A formidable process, and one which is so seldom called for that it cannot be called instinctive. Here, indeed, is the crux of the matter. There are birds and insects which go through as wonderful or even more complicated series of actions ; but intel- ligence is not involved, for the doing of one action brings into play the impulse to perform the next, and so on to the end of the series. But, break the series ever so slightly, and the creature is helpless.5 It is easy - the easiest thing in the world - for an organism to follow the path that has been beaten smooth by countless generations ; but to blaze a new trail, be it over ever so short a section of the route, is to triumph over immense diffi- culties. It has been done, or we would not have the variety of 1 The cowbird Molothrus ater lays in hole-nests, and is therefore believed, at least occasionally, to lay the egg outside the nest and carry it in its bill, Cf. British Bird Book , vol. 2, p. 472, and C. Bendine, Life Histories of N. American Birds, p. 436. 2 The French psychologist Giart has proved that the apparent maternal affection of the hen is dependent upon, if, indeed, it is not identical with, the occurrence of local inflammation. The hen sits on the eggs to obtain relief and the most unbroody hen may be converted into a perfect sitter by the simple expedient of irritating the appropriate places with pepper I 8 A bird victimised by a cuckoo will allow its own eggs and even wriggling young to perish outside the nest without taking the least interest. Photo- graphs have been taken of the egg and young bird being ejected from under- neath the sitting bird. Once outside the nest the egg had no meaning for the bird. Whitman, however, found that if the eggs of the dovecot pigeon were moved two inches away from the edge of the nest she would usually try to retrieve one or both ; in similar circumstances the ring-dove would be satisfied with one, while the passenger pigeon (now extinct) soon knew there was something wrong - and flew away.</page><page sequence="7">THE CUCKOO 87 behaviour which the world exhibits in its many organisms to-day. But for one slight divergence in behaviour to become instinctive through the behaviour of many generations is one thing ; for a whole string of purposive responses to a new situation to come into being and be retained in the inheritance of the species for the rare occasions on which it may be required is quite another. Prof. Kohler has recently shown us the limitations in the intelligence of apes ; the greatest height of intelligence they reached - and it is a great height - was when a chimpanzee whittled a stick with its teeth to make it fit into another stick and so enable it to reach a banana. Is it likely that where a longer chain of inference is involved a cuckoo would be able to deal with the situation ? On the other hand, if it is maintained that the laying of the egg in the nest by means of the bill when occasion requires is due to instinct, what sort of mysterious instinct is it which may be called into play so seldom ? To sum up the discussion : if a cuckoo can modify her behaviour to deposit an egg with her bill when occasion demands, no present-day theories of the nature of instinct or intelligence are adequate to meet the case. The problem, it may be seen, is not without considerable importance for modern psychology. Although the cuckoo still offers many interesting problems not a few errors in regard to its life-history have recently been dispelled. So lately as the middle of the last century there were some who held that the cuckoo sometimes laid in a nest of her own building on the ground. This error apparently arose through confusion of the young cuckoo with the young of the nightjar, although the nightjar usually lays its eggs on the bare ground.1 It was also believed until recently that some- times the young cuckoo devoured its own foster parents - a mistake repeated from the time of Pliny. Instances have indeed been put on record of the young monster killing a foster parent by swallowing the poor dupe's head.' The relevant passage as translated in Holland's Plinie is so quaint that the reader may like to have it by him : " The titling therefore, that sitteth, being thus deceived, hatcheth the egge and bringeth up the chick of another bird. And this young cuckoo being greedy by kind, beguiling the other young birds and inter- cepting the nest from them, groweth hereby fat and fair-liking, whereby it comes into special grace and favour with the dam of the rest and nurse to it. She joyeth to see so goodly a bird toward, and wonders at herselfe that she hath hatched and reared so trim a chick. The rest, which are her owne, indeed, 1 Mr. O. G. Pike, in Adventures Among Birds, has published a photograph of a nightjar's nest. ł Klein, Ordo Avium, p. 29.</page><page sequence="8">88 SCIENCE PROGRESS she sets no store by, as if they were changelings, but in regard of that one counteth them all misbegotten, yea, and suffereth them to be eaten and devoured of the other even before her face ; and this she doth so long, until the young cuckoo, being once fledged and readie to flie abroad, is so bold as to seize on the old titling and to eat her up that hatched her." In order to resolve some of the mysteries of the young cuckoo's existence I made a series of notes on the development of a bird in a nest not too far away to prevent my keeping it under daily observation. I looked up what had been already written on the subject and made my observations specially to obtain information on certain points which seemed to me to be in need of further investigation. The excerpts from my notes which follow are recorded as the answers I received to questions which I put to myself, such as : At what age can a young cuckoo throw an egg or young bird out of the nest ? Is it possible for it, when only a few hours old, to perform the prodigious feat of carrying an egg weighing almost as much as itself up the side of a nest and throwing it overboard ? What stimulates the young cuckoo to such a strange and difficult endeavour ? How long does the " tendency to eject " continue ? and when is it at its maximum intensity ? When does the hollow in the young bird's back, so well adapted for the purpose of evicting nest-mates, appear and disappear ? How exactly does the eviction take place ? Has the young cuckoo sufficient energy to eject several eggs or young birds in quick succession ? At what stage does the gape assume its bright red colour and when does the skin become black ? My observations are as follows : Monday, 4 th July, 1927. - At 9 a.m. I visited the hedge- sparrow's nest. The previous evening, about 8-30 p.m., a child saw the egg, described as being" mottled brown," lying in the nest. Now the young cuckoo has hatched. It is moving restlessly and continually opening its mouth, the inside of which is yellow, but not nearly so deep in colour as it will be. Its wings are prominent, and are more like arms than wings. The garden boy says he saw a large bird on the nest several days ago and found two hedge-sparrow's eggs thrown out, one resting among the twigs near the nest. A quarter of an hour later I again visit the nest. One of the two hedge-sparrow's eggs has chipped in a circle round the middle and the young bird is wriggling inside. The young cuckoo is naked and blind.</page><page sequence="9">Cuckoo's egg in linnet's nest. - it gets the egg on its back - and heaves it overboard. The egg irritates the young cuckoo - pushes it up the side of the nest Another view of the egg being ejected. Copyright photos , E . A . Armstrong. 88]</page><page sequence="10">THE CUCKOO 89 The skin over the eyes is dark. Visited the nest again in the evening at 6 o'clock. In the meantime, i.e. between 1 1 a.m. and 6 p.m., the egg has been thrown out. There is scarcely any hollow in the cuckoo's back. Skin pale flesh colour. Tuesday, 5 th July. - About 9 a.m. visited the nest. The other egg has been thrown out. The young hedge-sparrow is getting badly mauled by the arms of the wriggling cuckoo. Put the egg on the cuckoo's back, but even then it made no definite effort to throw it out. I kept the nest under obser- vation until midday. The cuckoo is uttering a very faint squeak. Replaced the egg. Wednesday, 6th July. - Visited the nest at 8-30 p.m. Young hedge-sparrow has completely disappeared. If pushed over- board it may have fallen into the hedge, where it would be impossible to see it. The egg has been pushed out and is resting on the side of the nest. Placed egg on the cuckoo's back, which is much hollower than it was. Immediately it set to work to push it out. It heaved the egg against the side of the nest, pressing with its beak on the nest bottom and gripping the sides with its feet, which are well developed. It worked haphazard round the nest with its wings flapping until it came where the side was not so steep, where it pushed the egg right out - bill still held against the floor of the nest, neck rigid, legs wide apart and stumps of wings waving. I thought it remarkable that even when the egg had been lodged on the side of the nest, and was no longer touching the cuckoo, it would make efforts to push it still farther - holding itself right out of the nest on what might be called the sill and giving, or trying to give, accord- ing as the egg had or had not rolled away, a further push or pushes. (Neither on this nor any other occasion did I get the impression that the cuckoo was feeling about with its wings ; rather that it used them automatically to help it to keep its balance.) The bird remains clinging for as long as about 20-30 seconds on the nest-sill in this final effort. Gradually its efforts subside and it drops back into the nest and lies as if exhausted. The whole process is over in about one minute. (I think no egg was left in the nest.) Thursday, yth July. - 10-30 a.m. The cuckoo is not very lively. It made no effort to throw out the egg, even when I put it on its back. (At first I was afraid that a heavy thunder- storm in the night had caused the hedge-sparrow to desert.) The skin is now black and quills are beginning to sprout on the wings, which have a scaly appearance reminiscent of wood- lice. The inside of the bill is much deeper in colour and might be called orange. The young bird already shows the cringing wriggle or shuddering movement so noticeable later when it is crying for food.</page><page sequence="11">9o SCIENCE PROGRESS I returned about 3 p.m. Put the egg on cuckoo's back and immediately it pushed it against the side of the nest where before it had not been able to get it out, and in a few seconds it was ejected. The cuckoo balanced itself on the sill of the nest and gave a final push which knocked the egg from where it had lodged on the rim of the nest off it into the twigs. I had not expected the bird to be so lively and expeditious, and had not set up the camera. Set up camera and tried again. The cuckoo promptly wedged the egg, which I had returned to the nest, against the side and heaved it out as before. I took two photographs - the first as the bird rested a moment with the egg up the side of the nest, the second when the egg was on the nest-sill and the chick was struggling with head down and flapping wings to give the final shove. I had to work quickly in order to change to the other side of the slide in time for the second photograph. I left the nest in order to change plates and returned about 4-20 p.m., when I took another picture of the egg being ejected, but this time from another angle. I was just too slow in changing plates to get a second photo. After this the cuckoo would not make a serious effort to throw out the egg again. It was perhaps exhausted. Later it moved about in a curious, uneasy way, sometimes throwing itself backwards, but not quite so as to fall on its back. The bird's querulous squeak is much more pronounced now. The strenuous jerking movements when the egg is right out on the nest's rim are remarkable, as one would expect a collapse after the egg has ceased to touch the young cuckoo. Such is not the case. After these final efforts the ugly black chick droops and falls back into the nest. Friday, 8 th July. - 3-30 p.m. " Cringing " is more notice- able. The quills have grown considerably. The garden boy has been experimenting with the bird and says that it has thrown out the egg three times already. As soon as I put it in it was ejected. The egg fell into the undergrowth and got lost. I looked about and found an apple nearly an inch in diameter. The young cuckoo reacted in exactly the same way. I have no doubt it would have thrown out this huge burden, but I thought it might become too exhausted and took it off its back. But it seems to recover very quickly. In the ejection process the creature usually pushes sideways against the object and then, with wings stretched back and flapping vigorously and beak bent down against the bottom of the nest, pushes backwards. Saturday, gth July. - 2-30 p.m. Quills grown and wings looking more like wings. The hedge-sparrow was brooding and sheltering cuckoo from the hot sun. I put in the small</page><page sequence="12">THE CUCKOO 91 apple and the chick hoisted it up as before. It did not get it out, but perhaps I did not let it try long enough. The garden boy told me that he had placed the apple in the nest earlier that day and that the cuckoo had thrown it out, getting up on the rim of the nest and finally pushing it right off. The creature is a black, ugly thing, always opening its bill, which is orange inside, and now cringing when it does so - quivering its attempt at wings. Its back is now rather a platform than a hollow. Sunday, 10 th July. - 10-30 a.m. Put in small apple and the cuckoo set to work at once to push it out. Monday, nth July. - 12-15 P-m- Put pebble on the cuckoo's back, but it made no effort to eject it then nor when it was put at its side. Its eyes are open to-day for the first time. Cheeping and cringing. Hardly any hollow in back. Wings well quilled and rounded. The inside of mouth is now definitely orange in colour. Tuesday, 12 th July. - 3-15 p.m. Put small apple on the cuckoo's back. It made no effort to eject, but rather tried to bite it. It allowed it to lie by its side. The creature occupies most of the nest now. Quills in wings and tail well sprouted. Back bare and black. Eyes not yet fully open. Wednesday, iļth July. - Gape reddish. Quills along back sprouting. Thursday, 1 Ąłh July. - Did not visit the nest. Friday, 1 5 th July. - The cuckoo is dead, badly bitten about the head by some small animal. How far have our queries been answered ? As regards the first question the evidence shows that an egg had been removed from the nest within twenty-four hours of the hatching of the cuckoo's egg. It could not be proved that the young cuckoo and not the old bird was responsible, but the circumstances leave no doubt in my mind that the deed was done by the newly hatched cuckoo. This observation is only confirmation of a discovery made as long ago as 1787 by no less a person than Dr. Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination, and recorded by him in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. lxxviii, 219-37. " On the 18th of June, 1787," he says, " I examined the nest of a hedge-sparrow, which then contained a cuckoo and three hedge-sparrow's eggs. On inspecting it the day following, the bird had hatched ; but the nest then contained only a young cuckoo and one hedge-sparrow. The nest was placed so near the extremity of a hedge that I could distinctly see what was going forward in it ; and, to my great astonishment, I saw the young cuckoo, though so lately hatched, in the act of turning out the young hedge-sparrow." To any-</page><page sequence="13">92 SCIENCE PROGRESS one who has not actually witnessed the paroxysm of energy which seizes the newly-hatched cuckoo it must seem incredible that a thing so small and flabby could hoist overboard the relatively gigantic burden of a hedge-sparrow's egg from the deep cup of the nest. " That, at the age of two days, it (the young cuckoo) should be able to throw out what to it must be a very heavy weight, is astonishing enough," writes Mr. F. B. Kirkman; " that it should do so a few hours after birth would border on the miraculous." 1 The miracle, if we like to call it so, does happen, and a most uncanny thing it is to see the soft, limp, sprawling squab suddenly suffused with this mysterious access of power. But as one watches the hideous creature, apparently so full of fiendish purpose and endowed with supernatural strength, it is to feel rather that the very powers of darkness are at work, incarnate in that wretched, murderous morsel of life. The behaviour of the young cuckoo reminded me of a story by a well-known war correspondent in which the hero manages to escape from the dungeon into which his Tibetan captors have flung him by chewing some hashish-like drug which gives him momentarily abnormal strength and enables him to raise a heavy flag-stone in the floor. As if it had its purpose clearly in view the creature braces its muscles, straddles its legs, balances the egg or young bird horizontally on its hollow back and grimly and methodically hoists it to the rim of the nest and actually climbs right out to give the final push which sends its victim to destruction - I had almost written perdition ! But, of course, to attribute purpose or malicious intent to the young cuckoo is sheer nonsense. We must not project our modes of thought into the behaviour of a chick a few hours old as if it could " Look before and after, and sigh for what is not." The cuckoo has no notion as to the consequences of its behaviour; it has no idea what it is doing. It goes through a series of reactions to its environment which are as natural to it, as automatic and conditioned, as to sit on its own eggs is natural to the hedge-sparrow. Virtue and vice are terms applicable only to the behaviour of mankind, and it is as unreasonable to praise a broody hen as to blame a wriggling cuckoo squab. The best explanation of the cuckoo's behaviour is that given by W. H. Hudson in his Hampshire Days, on page 1 6. He attributes the creature's efforts to the irritation caused by the contact of any foreign object with the sensitive sides and back. Let us have his own words. " The process in each case was as follows : The pressure of the egg against the cuckoo's side, as I have said, was a constant irritation ; but the irritability varied in degree in 1 The British Bird Book, vol. ii, p. 483.</page><page sequence="14">THE CUCKOO 93 different parts of the body. On the under parts it scarcely existed ; its seat was chiefly on the upper surface, beginning at the sides and increasing towards the centre, and was greatest in the hollow of the back. When, in moving, the egg got pushed up to the upper edge of his side he would begin to fidget more and more and this would cause it to move round, and so to increase the irritation by touching and pressing against other parts. When all the bird's efforts to get away from the object had only made matters worse, he would cease wriggling, and squat down lower and lower in the bottom of the nest, and the egg, forced up, would finally roll right into the cavity in his back, the most irritable part of all. Whenever this occurred a sudden change that was like a fit would seize the bird ; he would stiffen, rise in the nest, his flabby muscles made rigid, and stand erect, his back in a horizontal position, the head hanging down, the little naked wings held up over the back," and so the work of eviction would proceed. In connection with the ejection of a young robin it was only when its beak came in contact with the cuckoo's back that the latter shrank down into the nest, " as if hot needles had pricked him, as far as possible from the side where the cuckoo was lying against him, and this movement, of course, brought the robin more and more over him, until he was thrown right upon the cuckoo's back. Instantly the rigid fit came on, and up rose the cuckoo, as if the robin weighed no more than a feather on him ; and away backward he went, right up the nest, without a pause, and stand- ing actually on the rim, jerked his body, causing the robin to fall off clean away from the nest." There are several matters in this account which require further elucidation. The degree of sensitiveness of the cuckoo's back seems to vary considerably at different times. How is it that the bird I kept under observation did not show any signs of irritation on Tuesday and on Thursday morning ? Also, I found that pricking its back lightly did not annoy the cuckoo as I expected it to do. Direct pressure by some relatively heavy object was much more effective. Another point which would be worth inquiring into is whether the irritability disappears earlier when there is no egg or bird in the nest to keep up the irritation. In the case of the cuckoo of which the early life-history is given in the preceding pages, and which was supplied with objects to eject each day, the irritability persisted until the seventh day after hatching, whereas a bird observed by Mr. J. H. Gurney lost the desire to evict when it was three days and ten hours old.1 My notes show that although evictions may take place before the cavity in the young bird's back is pronounced and after it has almost disappeared, 1 Zoologist, 1905, p. 164.</page><page sequence="15">94 SCIENCE PROGRESS there is rough correspondence between the impulse to eject and the persistence of this adaptation for that purpose. Mr. Gurney reports that the depression in the back of the cuckoo mentioned was no longer perceptible when the bird was four days and four hours old. Dr. Jenner records that the depres- sion disappears about the twelfth day and the impulse to eject " begins to decline from the time the bird is two or three till it is about twelve days old, when, as far as I have hitherto seen, it ceases. Indeed the disposition for throwing out the eggs appears to cease a few days sooner ; for I have frequently seen the young cuckoo, after it had been hatched nine or ten days, remove a nestling that had been placed in the nest with it, when it suffered an egg put there at the same time to remain unmolested/ ' That the desire to evict should persist until the tenth or eleventh day seems to me, in view of my own obser- vations, very remarkable. In the case of my bird it is inter- esting to note that the impulse disappeared the day on which its eyes opened. Although Jenner 's account still remains as one of the best descriptions of these strange proceedings, he speaks of the purposeful employment of the wings in a way which I do not think is justified. He describes how the bird he was watching climbed to the rim of the nest and threw the young hedge- sparrow over, and proceeds: " It remained in this situation for a short time, feeling about with the extremities of its wings, as if to be convinced whether the business was properly exe- cuted, and then dropped into the nest again. With these, the extremities of its wings, I have often seen it examine, as it were, an egg and nestling before it began its operations ; and the nice sensibilities which these parts seem to possess, seemed sufficiently to compensate the want of sight, which as yet it was destitute of." Dr. Jenner is here falling into the error of which we have already spoken, the " anthropomorphic fallacy " of attributing human modes of thought and feeling to other creatures. Goethe said with justice, " Man never knows how anthropomorphic he is." The motto is an excellent one for all students of bird behaviour. As I have recorded in my notes, the movements of the cuckoo's wings seem to be as significant as the arm movements of a man walking the tight-rope and no more. They are automatic, and help the bird to keep its balance, and they may, by chance, help it to haul itself to the rim of the nest, or even, as they flap wildly during these struggles, knock the egg overboard, but they are not used as " feelers," as Dr. Jenner would suggest. My observations bear out those of Dr. Jenner, W. H. Hudson, and others that the cuckoo has a marvellous store of energy, such that with very short respites it may go on ejecting,</page><page sequence="16">THE CUCKOO 95 or trying to eject, eggs or young birds, or indeed other objects, one after another.1 For several days after the young bird has left the nest the unfortunate foster-parents may be seen feeding it assiduously, sometimes perching on the giant changeling's head in order to insert the food into its blazing red gape. Their pains are often rewarded by a vicious peck, which they are usually agile enough to avoid. " Chiz, chiz, chiz," goes the hungry, peevish cuckoo, and its foster-parents work like slaves while their own eggs or young rot beside the nest. The majority of the adult cuckoo population depart for their African winter quarters early in July. They usually go singly, but occasionally small parties are seen on migration. The young birds for the most part leave later and find their way alone, so that they leave our shores as much slaves to mysterious forces as when, newly hatched, they ejected their nest-mates. The life-story of a cuckoo is like the theme of a Hardy novel : a record of inscrutable forces playing with their blind, impotent victims. The great writer, so exquisitely sensitive to Nature, carried his outlook on her non-moral realm into the sphere of human activity. And is not this the explanation of his sad view of man and of life ? He set the forces of Nature on Olympus and personified them as the President of the Immor- tals ; but had he not forgotten that in knowing his own impotence man rises superior to blind forces, becomes Captain of his Soul in spite of the bludgeonings of fate, and inherits a wider destiny where blind force is not supreme and Righteous- ness, after all, is immortal ? In A Philosopher with Nature , Benjamin Kidd gives a vivid description of the power of the instincts which work to cause a bird to migrate and so preserve its life. Slave as it is, its bondage is to a taskmaster whose highest interest is the welfare of the creature and the race. He tells how a young cuckoo, kept captive after the usual time of migration, used to sit on a stationery-case in his study under a green-shaded reading-lamp, and quiver its wings rapidly. In the early stages the bird responded when he spoke to it, " but in time it ceased to do this, and became lost in a kind of trance with eyes open and wings ceaselessly moving. The bird became, as it were, locked in the passion of that sense by which the movement of flying was thus simulated/ ' 2 " All things go out in mystery/' said an ancient sage, and is it not better so ? What would life be but for the enchanted lands which lie beyond the distant mountain ranges, the 1 British Birds Magazine , vol. 8, p. 51. J. H. Owen records a case of a cuckoo ejecting two sedge- warbler's eggs at the same time. 2 P. 158.</page><page sequence="17">96 SCIENCE PROGRESS mysteries which encompass us, perplex us, and lead us onward ? But I am glad to know, as I sit here on a grey winter's day reflecting how the consideration of a wriggling young cuckoo may raise the greatest problems of philosophy, that when next I hear that wandering voice and the leaves are green again my heart will leap with joy, the world will grow young, and in spirit I shall sit once more in the dewy warmth of the morning sun and hear the cuckoos calling by the smooth waters of the Cam.
