In this temple there is a close connection between the linga , Narasimha and Varaha, who are considered to reside within the main temple. The main icon of the temple, i.e., Varaha Narasimha in anthropomorphic iconographie forrrris completely covered with sandal paste and is worshipped in the form of a linga. The temple art has more resemblances to the Orissan art in general and to Konark art in particular.1 The decorative art, carving of human and animal figures flora and geometrical designs gives the spectator an impression that the artist has fully utilised every architectonic limb of the temple with his carvings. Besides carving the life-sized icons of the different forms of God Vishnu i.e., Varaha, Trivikrama, Venugopala and Narasimha in the niches on the temple walls, figures of a royal person is also carved in between the pilasters on the outer walls of the temple. Ten such figures are observed on the Simhachalam temple and an attempt is made here to study in detail these royal icons and to identify the royal person with the help of the available contemporary sculptures depicting the royal personages and to analyse the political and religious conditions of the medieval times under which these images were carved. 1.2 During the medieval times, it appears to have become a customary practice to portray the figures of the kings responsible for the temple construction on the outer walls of the temples.2 Such types of practice can be observed from the temples of Madhukesvara at Mukhalingam, Lingaraja at Bhubaneswar, Jagannatha at Puri,. Surya temple at Konark, Bhimesvara temple at Draksharama and Vishnu temple at Korukonda. At all these temples we find the portrait sculptures either on the temple walls or on the pillars of the mandapas or sometimes as loose sculptures. 1.3 Though efforts have already been made to identify the royal figures of the Simhachalam temple with Narasimha Deva I (A.D.1 238-1 264) by late Prof. K.Sundaram,3 a detailed examination of why and how these royal figures are carved has not been attempted so far by any art-historian. The figures of the royal person are carved above the winding creeper issuing from a single stem with tendrils coiling around in between the pilasters. These sculptures depict a man as seated on a throne attended by servants, riding on a horse, mounted on</page><page sequence="2">843 an elephant, seated in padmasana, in meditating attitude, threatening the ill- behaved with sword, aiming bow and arrow and standing with a sword. All these different attitudes and moods of the same person indicates the royal ideology; and the significance of these sculptures is further stressed by their identical composition and iconographical similarities. It is highly reasonable to accept the view of K.Sundaram in identifying these with the Ganga ruler, Narasimha Deva I, as these figures have some resemblances to that of the royal figures of the King found on the temples of Konark and Puri. 1.4 Narasimha I was the son and successor of the Ganga King Ananga Bhima III, under whom the Ganga empire reached its zenith. He is the great builder of the Sun temple at Konark and he constructed it in about A.D. 1250. Many inscriptions of his successors praise Narasimha as the builder of the great Sun temple at Konark.4 According to the account of Abul Fazl Alumi, the court poet of Akbar, Narasimhadeva's minister, Siva Samantari was incharge of the temple project and 1200 masons and architects of ancient Kalinga worked on the temple of Konark.5 There are a series of unmistakable portrait sculptures of the king from the Sun temple at Konark which portrays him as the great worshipper» of a triad, consisting of a Sivalinga, Purushottama and Durga- mahishasuramardini; the king giving audience to his courtiers^ seated on a swing with lady attendants; seated on an elephant armed with bow and arrow and a gigantic shield; and the portrayal of the king about to undertake a journey. Some of these portrait sculptures of King Narasimha exist in situ at the Konark temple; four pieces are kept now at National Museum, Delhi;6 some in the Museum at Konark and one in the bhogamandapa of the Jagannatha temple at Puri. 1.5 Narasimhadeva's interest and involvement in the construction of the Simhachalam temple can be better understood when the temple epigraphs are carefully scrutinised. From the available epigraphical data it appears that the Ganga kings began to evince interest in the region around Simhachalam only in the first quarter of the 13th century A.D. Ananga Bhima III was the first Ganga ruler who incised his inscriptions in the Simhachalam temple.7 In an inscription issued in the Bhimesvará temple at Draksharama in the year A.D. 1216, Ananga Bhima is praised as the son of the three most powerful deities of Orissa: Purushottama, Siva and Durga.8 On the basis of this it was felt by A. Eschmann, H.Kulke and G.C.Tripathi that the king was anxious to combine the deities of the three important centres of Orissa. Puri, Bhubaneswar and Jajpur and make them jointly the sovereigns over his kingdom.9 Like his father Narasimha I was also called a Paramamahesvara, Sri Durgaputra and Sri Purushottamaputra. Therefore, it is quite likely that king Narasimha had tried to exceed the status of his father and to raise his imperial legitimation on an All-India level. The construction of the Sun temple at Konark by about A.D. 1250, far surpassed the temples of Tanjore (Brihadisvara) and Puri and it was thus the Orissan kingship that was legitimised through royal patronage of sub-regional, regional and All-Indian deities. In achieving this legitimacy of kingship, royal patronage of the regional cult is highly essential. Therefore, probably for this reason, Narasimha Deva I undertook the great renovation work in the Simhachalam temple which had been brought under the hold of the Gangas by the efforts of his father. Anbanga Bhima III. An inscription at Simhachalam informs us of Narasimha</page><page sequence="3">844 Deva's visit to the temple.10 Probably, it was during one of those visits that he had instructed his commander to renovate the temple and the work got completed in the reign of his successor. This can be gathered from an inscription dated A.D. 1268, of the time of king Bhanudeva I.11 The record mentions the fact that a commander built Srivimana, mukhamandapa, natyamandapa and tiruchuttumala of the temple in black stone under the orders from Vira Sri Narasimha Deva. This epigraphical reference shows clearly that the temple was thoroughly renovated during 13th century A.D. during and a little after the time of Narasimha Deva I. 1 .6 The choice of the Simhachalam temple for undertaking the great renovation work by Narasimha Deva was possibly for two major reasons. Firstly it is for the expansion of his royal power to the South. Secondly, it was to promote his religious ideology of the Great Triad i.e., Siva, Vishnu and Sakti. The Simhachalam temple is known to be a happy blend of Saiva and Vaishnava faiths in the main icon of the temple. Besides the temple at the top of a hill, which was originally a tribal place of worship is also significant.12 In this connection, it may be pointed out that Lord Vishnu in two of his incarnations as Varaha and Narasimha is closely associated with the aboriginal deities and tribal cults. These two incarnations of Vishnu may be called Vaishnava versions of Tantrism and are thus related to Saktism and to an extent Saivism also.13 This leads to suggest that the theriomorphic iconography of Varaha and Narasimha facilitates their being iconographically identified with an uniconical symbol in the temple of Simhachalam, where the main God is worshipped in the guise of a stone linga covered with sandal paste. The close affinity between the two Vaishnava Gods Varaha and Narasimha is also expressed by the fact that they are particularly often represented on Siva temples, often even as the only Vaishnava figures in the whole temple complex. This can be observed in the Madhukesvara temple at Mukhalingam14 and some temples of Ellora.15 1 .7 From the epigraphical evidence it is observed that Narasimha was the first king of Orissa, who bore the title, "Lord of the , Elephants" (gaja-pati ).16 The assumption this title by the king indicates the sovereign status of the king of East India. In the royal figures of the Simhachalam temple the king is shown as riding a horse as well as being mounted on an elephant which justifies his titles as "the lord of the horses" (asavapati) and the lord of the elephants (gaja- pati ). 1.8 While the royal sculptures of king Narasimha Deva of Konark and Puri portrays him as a devotee of the Gods - Surya, Durga, Purushottama and linga the royal sculptures of the king at Simhachalam are found without any association of either a God or a goddess, but simply represents him as a king, a heroic person, a person embodied with power and authority and maintaining law and order. 1.9 The present study based on the epigraphical and iconographical evidence reveals that Narasimha while making efforts to exceed the status of his father, to raise his imperial legitimation on an all-India level had constructed the temple at Konark dedicated to lord Surya. While trying to elevate his royal status and sovereignty he patronised the regional as well as the all-Indian deities. This is clearly shown in his royal policy of undertaking the major renovation work at the</page><page sequence="4">845 Varaha Narasimha temple at Simhachalam and constructing a new and massive temple structure for lord Surya. Thus, the present study brings to light the political as well as religious conditions under which the renovation work at the Simhachalam temple was carried out which incorporates the figures of the king on the temple walls showing his royal splendour and sovereignty during the medieval times.
