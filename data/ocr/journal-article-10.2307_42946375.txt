Since many commentators have linked personification with the sub- lime, one must first address the way in which its tropic form has achieved sublimity by defying the reader's ability to visualize the image it creates. One must then set in place two additional categories: prosopopoeia effected (a) by deification and (b) by euhe- merism - or, in other words, by incarnation and enlargement. The first is represented by the way in which poets such as Collins have created religious contexts for their per- sonifications, the second by the way in which others (Gray and Keats, for example) have given ordinary figures in the landscape a representative function. Paul Eggers, "By Whose Authority? Point of View in the First Chapter of Harold Frederic's The Damnation ofTheron Ware " / 81 Recent studies of The Damnation have focused on the novel's interrogations into the issue of authority and posited the reader's desire for "authoritative reading" as a mir- ror to the novel's thematic concerns. To date, critics have assumed that Frederic's inter- rogations of authority begin at the earliest with chapter two, which establishes the novel's focus, point of view, and several of the major characters. Drawing from the work of Roger Fowler on point of view, one may show that, through perplexing shifts of points of view, chapter one contributes significantly to an understanding of the novel's concern with authority. On the one hand, the chapter contains several easily distinguished shifts; on the other, it contains textual ambiguities militating against an apprehension of the point of view. Through this confluence of clarity and ambiguity, the first chapter implicates readers in "unauthoritative" readings much earlier than crit- ics have assumed. Paul Pellikka, "'Strange things I have in head, that will to hand': Echoes of Sound and Sense in Macbeth " / 14 Shakespeare's plays were conceived not as literary texts but as dramatic texts for the heightened spoken language of acting. But since most analyses of Shakespeare's lan- guage take a literary approach, there is a need for both aural analyses themselves and examples showing methods by which such aural analyses might be made. Macbeth offers an excellent example for analyzing aural style. An audience can hear the play as a complex network of language effects in which the actual sounds of the words relate, echo, and enhance the sense of the words, and which create a unique tonal fabric for the play, serving also to underscore important structural, semantic, thematic, and iron- ic relationships. In particular, the effects of alliterative consonance and complex allit- eration function as a stylistic principle throughout the play. In addition, other less eas- ily classifiable though clearly discernible language effects increase the complexity and the meangfulness of this particular style found throughout Macbeth.

The inte- grational semiology upon which this work is based, taking exception to the bi-planar paradigm of Saussurean-inspired semiologies as well as to telementational theories of communication, seeks to outline a theory of written communication, a theory of the written sign, and a theory of writing systems that contribute to a theory of writing with- in the context of various intersecting biomechanical, macrosocial, and circumstantial factors. While writing incorporates a number of features that have no equivalent in speech, be it in the production, processing, interpretation, or syntagmatics of the writ- ten sign as opposed to those of the spoken sign, Harris's innovative study nevertheless calls for a closer consideration of reading. Dennis Schofield, Beyond The Brain of Katherine Mansfield : The Radical Potentials and Recuperations of Second-Person Narrative / 96 Dominant dyadic structures of theories of point of view and narrative person have given little space for the exploration of narrative in the second person, but having become an issue for criticism and theory, the second person is bringing narrative theorists to re-examine their traditional distinctions and assumptions. Might the second person offer the next development in the tradition of point-of-view analy- sis, or a critique of the very assumptions inherent in that tradition? One fruitful approach involves seeing the metaphors of narrative person not as providing an ana- lytical perspective on fiction, but as constituting part of the fiction-making process itself. More particularly, it involves seeing them as strategies of naturalization and anthropomorphism - strategies deeply unsettled by you-narrative's strangeness - which act to maintain particular normative ideological and discursive structures. Seeing them this way entails a critique of what might be called the Cartesianism that deeply informs these metaphors and of the coherent, stable, and knowable subject that this logic, whether explicitly or covertly, constitutes as the prior, authorizing agent and condition of texts and reading. Reuven Tsur, "Douglas Hodge Reading Keats's Elgin Marbles Sonnet" / 34 One may explore the nature of the rhythmical performance of poetry by a close scrutiny of some crucial points in Douglas Hodge's recording of Keats's Elgin Marbles sonnet. The manipulations of the vocal devices, on the one hand, and the postulated mental processes, on the other, enable the listener's cognitive system to perceive both the lan- guage and the versification units when those conflict. This conclusion contradicts the received view (formulated by Chatman) that when the poetic text requires conflicting prosodie patterns, the reciter can actualize only one of them in his or her reading. Eric Wilson, "Terrible Simplicity': Emerson's Metaleptic Style" / 58 Emerson's style was animated by his observations of nature, from which he learned that matter is comprised of energy, be it organic life or electrical force. This discovery struck him as sublime, suggesting that things are not discrete and static, but condensa-</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts of Articles 219 tions of vast systems of force. He translated this insight into a sublime writing style, in which sentences are dynamic patterns charged with meaning on semantic, syntactic, and auditory levels. He constructed his essay Nature (1 836) to agitate readers as nature excited him. The master trope of Nature is metalepsis, which, as John Hollander has shown, compresses numerous tropes, figures, and allusions into dense linguistic sites that overwhelm readers with complexity. The trope has a diachronic and synchronic modality. Diachronically, it alludes to while revising earlier texts; synchronically, it condenses several tropes and figures into the same space. Emerson employs the trope in both modalities in Nature in an effort to write a new Bible. In the famous "trans- parent eye-ball" passage, he alludes to and revises revelatory moments in Judeo- Christian scripture in fashioning himself as a Visionary of natural revelation. He dis- closes his vision in ecstatic speech that imitates nature, exuberant with significance, stirring readers with the sublime. Thus metalepsis is a trope apt for detailing the for- mal qualities of indeterminate language and a locus where classical rhetoric and a poetics of indeterminacy enter into dialogue. Joyce Wexler, "Speaking Out: Dialogue and the Literary Unconscious" /118 To detect the unconscious of a literary text, one must regard all its explicit elements as manifest content and the nonexplicit links among them as latent content. One tends to think of the more idiosyncratic language of narration as the primary site of uncon- scious meanings because its distinctive style corresponds to the analysand's individual associations, but dialogue may be a better place to seek the unconscious of the text because it is conventional. Dialogue is governed by social usage that provides the unconscious with a ready-made disguise. On the one hand, Freud's dependence on conventional symbols and Lacan's claim that the unconscious is formed by cultural codes make speech a node of overde termi ned meanings, and, on the other, linguists account for the special capacity of dialogue to bear multiple meanings. To illustrate how psychoanalytic theory and linguistic analyses of conversation and dialogue can provide access to the unconscious of any narrative or dramatic work, One may analyze two texts that express homosexual desire in contrasting ways - latently in Henry James's story "The Beast in the Jungle," and manifestly in Tony Kushner's play Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes.</page></plain_text>
