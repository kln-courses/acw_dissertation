<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section IV: COUNTRIES OTHER THAN INDIA Sectional President's Address NEW DIMENSIONS IN THE STUDY OF THE THAI CIVILIZATION Y.K. Mishra I am deeply indebted to the Indian History Congress and its Executive Committee for electing me the President of the section - Countries other than India. It is, indeed, a rare privilege and great honour to be able to share some of my concerns with the learned members of this august body. I sincerely thank you all for reposing your confidence in me, though I am fully conscious and aware of the limits of my own scholarship. In fact, "Countries other than India" offer a vast field of historical research which surpasses the capacity of an individual scholar. It would be interesting to examine how as a nation, or as social and cultural groups we have seen the "other" communities beyond the political frontiers of India. And how the "others" have seen India in her different manifestations. The process of "othering" which is a dominant theme of current post-modern researches could be studied in depth so far historical relations of India with other countries of the world are concerned. As you are all aware, India has maintained close arici continued cultural contacts with her immediate neighbours in South East Asia, at least from the beginning of the Christian era. Powerful kingdoms and expansive empires arose in the mainland South East Asia, in the valleys of the Mekong, the Chao Phraya, the Irrawadi and the coastal region of Vietnam. Funan in southern Cambodia (first century to sixth century A.D.), Angkor in central Cambodia (niņeth to fifteenth century A.D.) and Pagan in Burma were some of the important centres of political power and cultural eminence. The maritime empire of Srivijaya in Indonesia centred around Palembang created a commercial and cultural network spread over peninsular and insular South East Asia.1 Of all the South East Asian civilizations and countries, I prefer</page><page sequence="2">Countries other than India 1205 to share with you my views on Thailand and her civilization for some specific reasons.^ First, Thailand is some sort of a bridge which connects China, mainland South East Asia with Indonesia, Australia and Madagascar. In other words, she connects the Indian Ocean with the Pacific. Exchange of people, technology, commerce and culture took place through the corridor provided by Thailand since the prehistoric times. Study of Thailand as a cultural and commercial corridor in Asia is yet to be undertaken. Secondly, Thailand provides opportunities to scholars to study all stands of South East Asian civiVzations. Broadly we can divide Thai history into pre-Thai and Thai epochs. The pre-Thai era spreads over an immense stretch of time, from the prehistoric age to the twelfth century. In the historic times, the Dvaravati civilization of Mon origin and the Khmer civilization flourished in parts of Thailand. The Mon-Khmer civilization is unanimously assigned to the Austro- Asiatic branch of humanity to which Munda and Khasi tribes of India belong. Our younger scholars could attempt various types of histories of long "duree", relating to the pre-Thai era of the history of Thailand. The Thai began to move southward to their present-day habitat in the Chao Phraya river from the 1 Ith» century A.D. onwards. In course of time, they established the powerful kingdom of Sukhothai, followed by the Ayuthyan kingdom and the present-day Chakri dynasty of Bangkok, forming the nucleus of Thailand and Thai civilization. It would be interesting to study the formation of Thai civilization as an intercultural process, defining the role of pre- existing Buddhism and Brahmanism and local cults in the area. It would not be out of place to point out that the Thai of Thailand are only one of the branches of the people of Thai/Tai stock. Till 1930s the country was known as Siam and its people the Siamese. Only in 1939 the country was renamed Thailand by Field Marshal Pibul Songrama. The relationship of the Siamese of Thailand with other branches of Thai/Tai people, settled in southwest China, Vietnam, Laos and northeastern India is yet another theme for further researchers. Finally a very important reason for drawing attention of this learned assembly to the study of Thai civilization is the absolute neglect of this area by Indian scholarship. In pre-independent India substantial work on Champa (South Vietnam), Kambujadesa (Cambodia) and Srivijaya (Indonesia) were carried out by Indian</page><page sequence="3">1206 IHC: Proceedings, 64th Session , 2003 scholars such as R.C. Majumdar, K.A. Nilkantha Shastri, B.R. Chatterjee. H.B. Sarkar etc. Inscriptions of Cambodia were studied by R.C. Majumdar and those of Java by H.B. Sarkar. Indian scholarship on Thailand was limited to the publication of "Hindu Colonies in Siam" by P.N. Bose which is now completely out of date. A Targe number of Sanskrit, Pali, Khmer and Siamese inscriptions have been found from Thailand, dating from 7th century A.D. to fifteenth century A.D. No Indian scholar attempted to study these inscriptions, as R.C. Majumdar did for Cambodia and H.B. Sarkar for Java. In post-independent India, eminent scholars like Prof. J. K. Roy, Ganaga Nath Jha and Lipi Ghosh have done excellent work on Thai international relations, domestic problems and social issues. The whole area of Thai cultural heritage and its linkage with India remains, however, an area of darkness in Indian scholarship. I would not hesitate to add that some pioneering work has been done in this direction at the department of Ancient Indian and Asian Studies under- the able guidance of two founder teachers of Magadh University, Professor Upendra Thakur and Professor Sachidanand Sahai. Painstakingly Prof. Sahai mastered the languages of north- east Thailand (Isan) and Laos, deciphered a number of palm-leaf manuscripts and published at least three important manuscripts with critical editions, translation and comparative study. In 1981 under the auspices of the Department of Asian Studies, Magadh University and with unflinching support of his colleagues, Prof. Sahai succeeded in convening the First International Conference on Thai Studies in New Delhi. For over two decades that international body is steering the progress of Thai studies on the global scale. Dr K.K. Dutta, the eminent historian and the founder Vice- Chancellor of Magadh University had the vision of integrating the study of Indian civilization with that of civilizations of neighbouring Asian countries in the shape of Department of Ancient Indian and Asian Studies, the only of its kind in India. However, in most of the universities of India^ the study of Indian and Asian symbiosis in the field of cultural history remains utterly neglected. The University Grants Commission has established Centres for South East Asian Studies in some of the universities of India. Unfortunately in most of these universities the focus of research is international relations and domestic politics. I urge the leading historians of India, assembled here under the auspices of Indian History Congress to take a serious note of this lopsided situation in historical studies and research and make personal efforts to develop Indian expertise for the study of cultural</page><page sequence="4">Countries other than India 1207 traditions of neighbouring Asian countries. Continuuing the thread of integrated study of India and South East Asia, I wish to focus the pre-historic discoveries in Thailand in past three decades. As early as 1952, Sauer suggested South East Asia earlier than Near East or elsewhere and spread from there to other parts of the world.2 Excavation at Ban Chiang and other sites in North East Thailand lend support to his views. The hypothesis about a very early date (6000 B.C.) for agriculture and metallurgy in Thailand formulated by Solheim and Gorman had rightly been contested.3 The revised studies on Ban Chiang suggest that this culture flourished between 3600 B.C. to 2000 B.C., leading to the development of a very sophisticated technology of bronze smelting and tool making, coupled with fine pottery specimens and cultivation of rice.4 We are no longer inclined to subscribe to the diffusionist theory of spread of elements of civilization, such as, technology, knowledge of metal and agriculture, from one specific centre to the rest of the world. However, the results of Thai prehistoric researches suggest an indigenous development of the knowledge of metallurgy and agriculture in the region. In the light of these prehistoric researches, a Chinese origin or an Indian origin theory of metallurgy and agriculture in South East Asia must be abanoned. In the more recent historic period, the finds from Ban Don Ta Phet in west central Thailand are quite remarkable as they provide the evidence for example between India and Thailand. More than 3000 beads have been found at Don Ta Phet: glass beads and beads made from semi-precious stones such as Crystal, Agate and Carnelian. Numbers vary from two or three up to several hundreds in a single burial. From the point of view of contacts with the West, the most interesting of the glass beads are large, translucent, green sided prisms. These large hexagonal beads from Don Ta Phet are remarkably similar to the famous beryl crystals of South India which were so popular in the Buddhist cultures of North India as well as the Roman world and which atttracted the attention of Pliny the Elder. The etched beads from Don Ta Phet most closely match the Indian specimens from the Ganga valley between about 600 B.C. and A.D. 200. There is need for micro comparative studies in South and South East Asian archaeology. A young Indian scholar Kishore Basa from Orissa has recently made a valuable comparative study of early Thai and Indian glass beads.5 Such micro studies are useful to widen our knowledge of exchange between India and Thailand as well as other regions of South East Asia.</page><page sequence="5">1208 IHC: Proceedings , 64th Session , 2003 You are well aware that in 3rd century B.C. during the reign of Asoka Buddhist mission consisting of Sona and Uttara went to the land of gold (Suvarnabhumi), as attested by Sri Lankan chronicles.6 The historians differ about the identification of land of gold and its political and cultural centre.7 It is regrettable that in this scholarly debate very little importance has so far been attached to the potential of collective memory of a region in the reconstruction of its cultural history. Though the Burmese historians claim that Thaton was the centre of land of gold, no archaeological remains have been found from that site. On the other hand in the Thai collective memory. "The First City" (Nakhon Pathon) i.e. Nagar a Prathama, still survives as the city founded by Asokan missionaries, Sona and Uttara. It is located some 60 km. almost due west of Bangkok. Nakhon Pathom is supposed to be the centre of the 7th century kingdom of Dvaravati. The existence of this kingdom is attested by the silver coins, unearthed at Nakhon Pathom, bearing a Sanskrit inscription which might be translated as "the merit of the king of Dvaravati". Dvaravati corresponds to T'o-lo-po-ti, a kingdom mentioned to the west of Isanapura (Cambodia) and east of Srikshetra by the Chinese pilgrim Hiuan Tsang. The fact that Dvaravati forms part of official name of two later Thai capitals, Ayuthya founded in 1350 and Bangkok founded in 1782, 8 points to the role of collective memory in Thai civilization. There is an urgent need to study the Dvaravati Buddha images which date from 7th to 11th century and display influence of Gupta, post-Gupta and Pala styles. A study of these Indian art forms in the context of Dvaravati art of Thailand would be quite illuminating. At the same time the stronger indigenous features of later specimens of Buddha images of Dvaravati could not be ignored. These specimens are characterized by large hair-curls, a flat face, curved and connected eyebrows, prominent eyes, a flat nose and thick lips. The Buddha images, standing or seated on the head of a curious composite beast deserve special attention of students of Indian iconography and art. The curious beast in question is named "Panasbati" by Thai archaeologists. The beast seems to have a beak of Garuda, ears and horns of a bull and wings of a hamsa. These three animals are mounts of the three great Brahmanical gods, Visnu, Shiva and Brahma. The placement of the Buddha upon the composite beast might be an attempt to establish the superiority of Buddhism over Brahmanism.9</page><page sequence="6">Countries other than India 1209 The Dvaravati specimens of stone Wheels of the Law and figures of deer are of special importance for the study of diffusion of Buddhism in Thailand and other parts of South East Asia. They are important symbols to mark the presence of the Buddha before the creation of anthropomorphic Buddha images. Though these stone Wheels of Law in Thailand have affinities with the Gupta style of art, they may be imitations of earlier specimens brought by the Asokan missionaries, Sona and Uttara to Thailand. These stone Wheels of Law (Dharmachakras) bear the following inscriptions of the Buddhist credo in Pali: ye dhamma hetuppabhava tesam hetumtathagato aha tesam ca yo nirodho evamvadi mahasamano ti "Of all objects which proceed from a cause the Tathagata has explained the cause, and he has explained their cessation also; this is the doctrine of the great samana." Several stone deer images were found with the Dharmachakras in the compound of the Phra Pathom Chedi at Nakhon Pathom. The finding of these stone wheels associated with the deer images and bearing the Buddhist credo confirm that they symbolize the setting in motion of the wheel of the Law by the Buddha in his first sermon in the Benaras Deer Park. Many Dharmachakras might have been set up during the Dvaravati period (7th-8th century A.D.) to commemorate Asoka's mission to Suvarnabhumi.10 Dvaravati votive tablets made in terracotta have been unearthed in large number in past four decades. They bear the Buddhist credo "ye dhamma". One of the Dvaravati types of Buddhist votive tablets represents the Buddha seated in the forest of Paliieyaka, flanked by an elephant on one side and by a monkey on the other. Some of these terracotta votive tablets still show strong Gupta influence and others reveal Pala influence. These specimens of votive tablets deserve a comparative study, so do the examples of Stupa in Dvaravati art. Dvaravati art and culture was spread over central, north-eastern and southern parts of Thailand from 7th to 13th century A.D. The recent researches show that the Möns were only a segment of the population in Dvaravati civilization.11 As I have already mentioned earlier. Thailand is a cross road of civilizations. In this respect, southern Thailand deserves special mention. The Srivijayan style of art flourished there from 8th to 13th century A.D. as a mark of Indonesian influence on this part of the country. Chaiya in the Surat-thani province of southern Thailand</page><page sequence="7">1210 I HC : Proceedings , 64th Session , 2003 is an important Srivijayan art centre which requires a detailed study. In the central, eastern, and north-eastern parts of Thailand, influence of the Khmer culture and art flourished from 11th to 13th century A.D. The monuments and sculptures found from this area are grouped under Lopburi style. The Lopburi images are carved in stone or cast in bronze. Most of these specimens belong to Mahayana Buddhism. In a number of specimens the Mahayana Triratna (Three Gems) is shown personified by the Buddha under Naga in the middle, flanked by the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara on the right and the Praj naparami ta on the left. Phimai in the north-east Thailand and the Three Towers (Phra Prang Sam Yot) in central Thailand are two important Buddhist monuments of this style. The impact of Mahayana Buddhism on art and culture of Thailand and Cambodia in 12th and 13th century coupled with the influence of Pala art points to Nalanda as the source of inspiration for artistic activities in the region. Discovery of a Sanskrit inscription from north-eastern Thailand in the recent years lends support to this hypothesis.12 With the arrival of Theravada Buddhism in Thailand, new trends emerged in the art of the region which was previously dominated by the Brahmanical Khmer art. Art historians in India have focussed their attention on various art schools which flourished in India and influenced the art styles in South East Asia. The study of Sukhothai art is challenging in the sense that it demands a careful examination ofSri Lankan traditions as well as the Thai/Siamee genious. During the Ayodhya period (14th-18th century A.D.), Theravada continued. But there was a revival of Brahmanism, because the Siamese rulers of that period incorporated the Khmer traditions in their polity and cultural manifestations. The current Chakri dynasty began to rule Thailand in the late 18th century. In last two hundred years, they have evolved a civilization which is symbiosis of Theravada Buddhism and Brahmanical traditions. It combines traditions with modernity.13 A perusal of Thai history is required to convince ourselves that the division of history in ancient, medieval and modern is completely artificial. Modern Thailand is distinguished by industrial and technological developments and by the refinement of ancient traditions of. dance, drama and music, inspired by the Theravada Buddhist tradition of Jatakas and the Brahmanical traditions of Ramayana (Ramakien). The Vessantara Jataka in modern Thai art</page><page sequence="8">Countries other than India 1211 and culture is a living example of Thai symbiosis of tradition and modernity. A critical study of Thai languages will offer us a new paradigm to understand the process of Indo-Thai cultural contacts. The impact of Sanskrit and Pali language on Thai and other languages of South- East Asia has so far retained the attention of researchers. True, Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit and the regional languages traveled to Thailand with the Indian settlers. These languages made an impact on Thai language. As a result Thai vocabulary includes a large number of Indie borrowings. At least seventy-five percent of technical terms are of Indie origin. Even today, the Thai resort to Sanskrit vocabulary for forming new technical words which they require. Thorasap (durasabda). Vithayu (vidyut), akson (aksara) designated respectively telephone, radio, alphabet etc. However, we are very often oblivious of the fact that the Thai and Sanskrit are the languages of two different families. Thai is a tonal, non-inflectional language. Sanskrit and the related languages of the Indo-Aryan family are polysyllabic, inflectional languages. Once a Sanskrit word is taken into Thai language it undergoes considerable transformation, both morphological and semantic. King Ramakhamhaeng of Sukhothai is supposed to have invented Thai script, following the alphabet systems current among the Mon and Khmer peoples who in turn followed the alphabet system of India. He had to add more consonant signs, kha2, sa, d2, b, phi, ph2 for which there is no equivalent in Indo-Aryan languages. In the first quarter of twentieth century, King Rama VI, better known as King Vajirvudh of the present Chakri dynasty of Bangkok revitalized the study of Sanskrit language in Thailand. He translated a number of Sanskrit works into Thai. Since then the Thai make all possible efforts to write Sanskrit words that were used in Thai with Thai script as correctly as possible. Currently, the Rajapandita samsthana, or the Royal Institute under the patronage of His Majesty the King of Thailand is responsible for officially coining the Thai words from foreign words. Sanskrit and Pali words are usually borrowed to coin new technical words. The borrowed words are subjected to phonetic and semantic changes in keeping with the requirements of a non-inflectional tonal language. In brief, the process of Thai-ization of Indie languages in Thailand offers a whole new range of research possibilities.14 With the beginning of the thirteenth century, Indian influences in shape of Theravada Buddhism reached Thailand and parts of</page><page sequence="9">1212 I HC: Proceedings , 64th Session , 2003 Indochina (Burma, Laos, Cambodia) through Sri Lanka. Pre-Siamese Thailand was influenced by the Brahmanical and Mahayana Buddhist traditions. It would be a rewarding endeavour to examine the rupture of traditions in this part of Asia. What were the reasons that led the Thai people of Sukhothai to reject the Brahmanical and Mahayana Buddhist tradtions. It would be necessary to look into the pre-Thai political systems, particularly the Khmer polity to understand the new forces of Theravada Buddhism at work. It has been generally accepted that the last phase of the Khmer rule, represented by the Mahayanist King Jayavarman VII was most repressive. Common man was burdened by corvee to execute the ambitious building plans of the king and mercilessly exploited by the Brahmanical religious foundations. Theravada Buddhism offered them a simple way of life and a political regime which was the least oppressive. Ramakhamhdeng, one of the kings of Sukhothai, was accessible to everyone in his kingdom. In course of over seven hundred years of their presence in the present-day Thailand, the Thai or the Siamese of the Chao Phraya River valley have evinced the spirit of renewal. Successive generations of Thai have responded to the demands of their time and learnt to preserve their Buddhist heritage in the changed circumstances of the period. Consequently Buddhism flourishes today in Thailand as a living tradition that of offers us a promising field of future study. The Sukhothai era between 1250 to 1350 is considered as the formative period of Thai Buddhism. The Thais ôf this newly founded kingdom (1238 A.D.) took over the Buddhist heritage of a long standing, fostered by Funan, Dvaravati, Chenla and Angkor and slowly recast it in a unique Thai mould. Of the eight successive rulers of Sukhothai, King Ramakhamhaeng, the third ruler of this house, is well-known for his innovations in the field of language, literature and religious practices. As we have noted, he invented the present- day Thai script, enabling the Siamese to write the Buddhist literature in their own script. Accommodating the popular belief in the spirit worship, the kings of Sukhothai period encouraged the practice of Theravada Buddhism. Devoutly Buddhist, King Ramakhamhaeng invited monks from Sri Lanka to establish the religion of Sakyamuni in its original purity. In the reign period of Loe Thai, the son and successor of Ramakhamhaeng, the relations between Sukhothai and Sri Lanka became closer. During this period a Thai prince assumed the yellow robe and undertook a journey to Sri Lanka as well as India. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, Buddhism had almost vanished from India. However, the Thai prince considered worthwhile a pilgrimage to the source. A long inscription found from</page><page sequence="10">Countries other than India 1213 Sukhothai gives a detailed account of this prince's career. He had a worldly youth, "now doing good, now doing evil, now laughing, now crying, now winning, now losing, now happy, now unhappy, turning, going and coming," with the unquiet heart in the midst of this world of transmigration. "It seems that around the age of thirty, he lost a son and this bereavment made him understand that "this world of transmigrations is unstable, ephemeral, illusory". After having "practiced the perfection of liberality", in imitation of the Buddha in his last earthy existence, "he put on the robes and quit the world, carrying the beggars bowl in a sash, slung over his shoulders". Siam has seen many such curious figures of "prince monks" even well into the twentieth century. He is undoubtedly the same person, spoken of in an inscription that tells of a prince's travels in the north of Muang Fang, Phrae, Lamphun and Tak then to India." to the kingdom of Kalinga, to Pataliputra, to Cholamandala, to the kingdom of Mallas and to the island of Lanka to try to find precious relics."15 The rise of Ayuthya in 1350, heralded radical changes in the concept and style of Thai monarchy, entailing fundamental change in the Buddhist perspective. The Sukhothai rulers had subscribed exclusively to the Buddhist ideal of kingship represented by the concept of the Dharmika Dharmaraja and were both paternal and accessible to their people. At Ayuthya the king is not the father of his subjects as in Sukhothai. He is some sort of a living Buddha. As a result of the Burmese conquest of Ayuthya, in 1767, the Siamese suffered both politically and spiritually. Sack of Ayuthya marked brutal rupture in the building of the Buddhist traditions. In 1782, when King Rama I ascended the throne, innaugurating the present-day Chakri dynasty at Bangkok, he faced the Burmese threats successfully and initiated an impresi ve programme of Buddhist revival in the kingdom of Thailand. He undertook to rescue the ancient images of the Buddha which, as a result of the Burmese wars, lay scattered and mutilated in the ruined temples of Ayuthaya, Lopburi and Sukhothai. Over twelve hundred bronze images of the Buddha, of life size or large, were brought to Bangkok and set up in newly built monasteries. He assembled manuscripts of the Canonical texts, invited a council of monks to collate them, and had an authentic recension of the whole collection prepared. The Buddhist revival in Rama I's reign was possible due to deep faith of Thai people in Buddhism: the neighbouring Buddhist countries including Sri Lanka were not in a position to help Siam at this juncture due to their own domestic problems.</page><page sequence="11">1214 ÍHC: Proceedings , 64th Session , 2003 Later in the reign of Rama II (1809-24 A.D.) spiritual links with Sri Lanka were reestablished. The next King Rama III (1 824-5 1 A.D.) was a very zealous supporter of Buddhism. Throughout his reign, Prince Mongkut, the future King Rama IV was a monk. He acquired a matchless knowledge of Pali of the Cannon. He made various reforms in the Buddhist practices, giving rise to a new sect called Dhammayutika. After his accession to the throne in 1851. King Mongkut gave equal patronage to the old Buddhist order (Mahanikya) and new sect founded by him.16 In the reign of King Rama V (1868-1910), the Buddhist linkage between India and Thailand became stronger as the young king visited India for 47 days in 1872. He visited Saranatha and gathered information about other Buddhist sites in India. On his return, Thai scholars were able to get first hand information about the state of Buddhism in India. Two Buddhist stupas, imitating the Dhammekha stupa in Saranath were built in the heart of Bangkok. In 1898, when the relic of the Buddha were found iri Piparahava, King Chulalonkgorn claimed it as the only reigning Therevadin Buddhist monarch of an independent Asian nation. He distributed parts of relics amongst the Buddhist nations of Japan, Burma, Sri Lanka and Siberia. The remaining portion of the relics were deposited on the top of a stupa in the heart of the city of Bangkok.17 In course of past seven hundred years beginning with the independent Siamese kingdom of Sukhothai in the 13th century A.D., the teachings of Buddha has percolated to every hamlet and hut in remote corners of Thailand. Buddhists. Today, nearly 94 percent of the people of Thailand are Theravada Buddhists. Less than two percent, mostly of Chinese origin, are Mahayana Buddhists. The Muslims constitute some four percent of the total, while the Christians number only about 150,000 or half one percent of the Thai population, despite centuries of Western missionary efforts. There are about 300,000 monks in Thailand today. The number is difficult to be precise. Monks in Thailand can remain robbed from three days to the whole life. Part of them are novices. At the age of 20, they may be then ordained monk. Theravada Buddhism in Thailand has to be understood in the social and cultural context of this country. There has never been any separation of Buddhism from State. No question of "Throne and Altar", at least up to 150 years ago, as the country started its new mode of production and the social reform took place. Theravada has coexisted in Thailand with animistic beliefs and Brahmanical rituals.</page><page sequence="12">Countries other than India 1215 With the process of modernization, the role of Buddhist monks and monasteries might seem to have shrunk to only religious and spiritual aspects of life. However, if we look back to Thai society since 1970*8, it appears that the Thai Buddhist monks and Thai Buddhist laity have played vital role as catalyst of social change. Young monks, mostly from two Buddhist universities played a very important role during the democratic period from 1973-76. Buddhadas Bhikkhu, considered to be Nagarjuna of our modern times started to search for a new Buddhist way of life in 1934. His main aim was to go back to the source to define the "real Buddhism" as an antidote for the "materialistic way of life and superstitious beliefs". Another Buddhist monk who has helped Thai intellectual community tremendously to understand how to apply Buddhist principles for alternative development is Phra Dhamma Pitaka or Bhikkhu Payutto, a Thai scholar of Theravada Buddhism. His magnum opus, Buddha-Dhamma and other writings have inspired many lay people who did not think Buddhism was relevant to the present society. In 1975, Phra Bhodiraksa, a monk ordained some years before, declared himself, together with all his followers, monks and laity, independent from the Buddhist Council. The event was daring, as it has never happened in such a decisive way in Thai history. The new group established itself in Santi Asoka, a monastery in Bangkok suburb, and in three other monasteries and communities in the provinces. Phra Bhodiraksa is often compared to Martin Luther in the 16th century. There is, however, no explicit "excommunication" from the official Buddhist institution. The new movement grows, attracting many who also seek a new way. The characteristics of the "Asokains" is their strictness in observing the precepts and being vegetarian. In Santi Asok there is no place for temporary monkhood lasting for a minimum period of 3 days. Once you are admitted you are supposed to live your whole life as monk or nun. In contemporary Thailand, more and more monks are engaged in social action today, mostly in the rural areas in north-east, north and central Thailand. The Thai civilization should be seen in a broader pan-Asian perspective, questioning the notion of an oriental civilization centred around the great traditions represented by India and China. In fact, a number of "little" traditions represented by Thai communities</page><page sequence="13">1216 IHC: Proceedings , 64th Session , 2003 spread over various parts of Asia run parallel to these so called great traditions. The Thai communities, artificially termed Tai by the western anthropologists, are confined not only to the Chao Phraya River valley in the present-day Thailand. Thai Lu in Yunnan (southwest China), Shah in Burma. Black Thai in the Red River delta, the Lao in the People's democratic Republic of Laos and a number of Thai communicaties in the Brahmaputra valley of noreast India - all these communities represent dynamics of Thai civilization. They are expert in wet rice cultivation for which they have selected the most fertile valleys and plains in Asia. They had their own procedures and techniques of political formations. The Thai style city state or the muang and the process of the muang formation deserve special attention in the study of state formation in various parts of the world. In order to explore the vitality and dynamism of Thai civilization in its broadest sense, we need not go to far off countries of Asia. Let us confine our attention to the Brahmaputra valley to judge the role of Thai communities in political formations in northeast India. At least six Thai groups - Ahom, Khamti, Phake, Aiton, Turung, and Khamyang are settled in different parts of the Brahmaputra valley. The Ahoms live in upper Assam in innumerable villages. Khamtis are found in the villages of Arunachal Pradesh, besides seven villages in Lakhimpur district of Assam. Khamyang villages are situated in the plain areas of Assam towards the side of the Naga hill. Six Turung villages are located in the Jorhat district of Assam. Eight Aiton villages are found in Assam. A closer look at these handful of villages, lost in the remote corners of the Brahmaputra valley, will offer new insights in the regional history of India. The movements of various ethnic groups of Thai along the northeast frontiers of India clearly suggest the importance of cross cultural relations, transcending the political frontiers established artificially through political and military actions. From the thirteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of these groups travelled from the upper parts of Burma via Patkoi hills, selected lands of their choice, farmed fallow lands, practiced Theravada Buddhism and coexisted with other tribal groups of the region. The survival of these cultural islands in northeast India offers us opportunity to understand the interactive forces of human civilization. Out of these ethnic groups I would particularly mention the Khamti and the Ahom, for different reasons. The Khamti revolt of</page><page sequence="14">Countries other than India 1217 1839 against the British, seen in relation to a number of peasant movements in different parts of India, offers us better possibilities to evaluate pan-Indian reaction against the colonial rule. In this revolt other neighbouring tribes made common cause with the Khamti, who being a more advanced and militant group, were entrusted with the leadership. Though the rebellion failed, the sense of discontent, prevailing in different parts of India, could be measured by a detailed study of the Khamti uprising. The Ahom state formation in the Brahmaputra valley in the middle of the thirteenth century and its survival for the next six hundred years raises a number of cultural and theoretical issues. With nine thousand followers, a Thai Chief Sukhapha marched across Patkoi hills from the Shan state of upper Burma and reached the Brahmaputra valley around 1228 A.D. He settled around sibasagara in the district of Dibrugarh in upper Assam. They made Charaideo as the centre of their modest city state (muang). A closer look at various Ahom manuscripts clearly suggest that they entered the boundaries of the present-day Assam, not as invaders, but as the communities searching for vacant and fallow land. Sukhapha's followers converted the vast jungle lands into cultivable fields. His knowledge of testing density of water to ascertain the extent of fertility that it contains and his selection of thinly populated area for settlement the typical Thai genious for wet rice cultivation. He stationed his men in various places during his journey beyond the Patkai Hill till he reached Charaideo in order to bring those places under cultivation. In fact, he laid foundations of Thai style villages (ban) on his way to the Brahmaputra valley. He created a network of satellite villages, skilled in rice cultivation with Charaideo as its city centre. The state formation in the thirteenth century Assam resulted from the Thai style manipulation of manpower and expansion of the zone of clientele. Sukhapha's search of vacant and fallow land does not mean that he was operating in the region devoid of population. A number of aboriginal tribes were dispersed in the area. The newly found Thai villages had to coexist with the earlier neighbouring settlements. Sukhapha succeeded in creating a network of patron-client relationship to absorb the neighbouring tribes in his fold. His well- known statement with which he addressed the local tribes reveals his method of networking of loyalties: "Come and have mutual introduction with us.

While the Thai ethnic groups which entered northeast India after the Ahom retained the practice of Theravada Buddhism and lived in Thai style villages (ban)the Ahoms were gradually Hinduized during their six hundred years of rule in Assam. The kings adopted Sanskrit names and worshiped Siva. However, under the veneer of Hinduism, the Ahoms preserved many of their old beliefs and structure of a casteless society. It would be interesting to study the emergence of regional Assamese identity during six hundred years of Ahom rule and contribution of Thai communities in the formation of this identity. According to the consensus of opinion the word Assam itself derives from Ahom, the name of the ethnic community which ruled this area. The factors responsible for the formation of formidable military might of the Ahom is yet another area of further research. In 1662, the massive invasion of the Mogul under the general Mir Jumla, assisted by a navy fully manned by the Europeans, particularly Portuguese forced the Ahom army to retreat temporarily. However, the inhospitable climate and the Ahom guerilla tactic so much harassed the Mogul army that Mir Jumla agreed to evacuate Ahom territories, subject to cession of western Assam as war indemnity and on payment of annual tributes to the Mogul emperor. In 1671, the Ahom Navy foiled the last Mogul attempt to subdue the Ahoms. The Ahom state survived till the Burmese invasions of the first quarter of the nineteenth century which led to the imposition of the British rule over Ahom territory. In brief, six hundred years of Ahom rule in northeaster India could offer us useful insights into the dynamism of pan- Asian Thai/Tai culture.18 Finally, I wish to draw your attention to the most precious Thai archival heritage in Assam which needs protection, preservation and prospection. A large number of manuscripts written in Ahom, Phake or Khamti script are preserved in different private collections, in Buddhist viharas or in various government or semi-government institutions. The Ahom manuscripts are of the following six categories: 1. Religious 2. Secular manuscripts mainly the Buranji or books of lineage 3. Morals; the manuscripts containing the Thai code of conduct. 4. Astrology 5. Mantra or books of hymn 6. Vocabulary books</page><page sequence="16">Countries other than India 1219 Almost every Khamti village in Arunachal or Phake villages in upper Assam has a vihar which preserves a fairly good number of manuscripts. A careful analysis of these manuscripts will throw a flood of light on many forgotten chapters of regional history of Assam and provided new insights into cross cultural relations between India and South-East Asia through land route.19 Once again I sincerely thank you all for offering me this opportunity to share my views with you.
