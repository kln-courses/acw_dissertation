Zayds Mafh?m an-nass (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1996). 2) Ab? Zayd was born on 10 July 1943 in Quh?fa near Tanta, Egypt, and received his B.A. (1972), M.A. (1977), and Ph.D. (1981) with the Highest Honors in the Department of Arabic Language and Literature at Cairo University (1968-1981). He was appointed Assis tant Lecturer, and was later promoted to Assistant and Associate Professor in the same department. However, his bid for promotion to full professor {ust?dh) was officially denied on 3 December 1992 due to the allegedly heretical writings in his submitted books and papers to the University Tenure and Promotion Committee.

Zayd coined the term humanistic hermeneutics in his public lectures on 27 May 2004 when he was appointed as the Ibn Rushd chair of humanism and Islam at the Uni versity for Humanistic Studies in Utrecht, the Netherlands. However, he did not offer a clear and coherent definition of the term humanistic hermeneutics. Nor did he apply such a term in specific reference to Mafh?m al-nass and many of his previous works in Arabic written before his exile to the Netherlands in 1995. See Ab? Zayd, Rethinking the Qur'?n:</page><page sequence="3">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 183 with a humanistic orientation. The hermeneutic act is considered humanistic in so far as it signifies a human-oriented interpretation of the Qur'?n. Not only does the human interpreter represent an Towards a Humanistic Hermeneutics (Amsterdam: Humanistics University Press, 2004). A study of his humanistic hermeneutics of the Qur'an remains mostly unexplored due to the public attention on the so-called "Abu Zayd affair" (qadiyyatAb? Zayd). The affair reached its culmination on 14 June 1995 when the Cairo Court of Appeals {Mahkamat Ist?n?f al-Q?hird) ruled that Abu Zayd was an apostate from Islam and ordered that he separated from his wife, Ibtih?l Y?nis. This sentence was subsequently upheld by the Egyptian Supreme Court {Mahkamat al-Naqd al-Misriyya). The affair has attracted much attention, legal and political, from most Western scholars. For example, Kilian B?lz focused on the legal argumentation of the court rulings dealing with the question of how the charge of apostasy was established in the family trial on the basis of scholarly writings in the academic milieu. Kilian B?lz, "Submitting Faith to Judicial Scrutiny through the Family Trial: The Abu Zayd Case," Die Welt des Islams 372 (Jul., 1997): 135-155. Similarly, George N. Sfeir dealt with the analytical reasoning of the legal aspects of apostasy in light of the state con stitutional guarantee to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of scien tific research. George N. Sfeir, "Basic Freedoms in a Fractured Legal Culture: Egypt and the Case of Nasr Hamid Ab? Zayd,' Middle East Journal 52, 3 (Summer 1998): 402-414. Of interest is also J?rn Thielmanns Nasr Hamid Ab? Zaid und die wiedererfundene hisba - Sarta und Q?n?n im heutigen ?gypten (W?rzburg: Ergon, 2003). The Dutch lawyer Maurits S. Berger took up the legal notion of public policy {al-niz?m al-amm), instead of the role of Islamists, as a determining factor in the issuance of the apostasy ruling. Maurits E. Berger, "Apostasy and Public Policy in Contemporary Egypt: An Evaluation of Recent Cases from Egypt's Highest Courts," Human Rights Quarterly 25 (2003): 720-740. A turn to politics is provided by the Michigan scholar Fauzi M. Najjar who looked at the public controversy as an increase in the degree of real political conflict between Muslim funda mentalists and liberal-secular intellectuals in contemporary Egyptian politics. Fauzi M. Najjar, "Islamic Fundamentalism and the Intellectuals: The Case of Nasr Hamid Ab? Zayd," British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 27, 2 (2000): 177-200. What interested the Amer ican anthropologist Charles Hirschkind is not so much the degree of contentiousness, which often culminates in prosecution and violence in modern Egypt. Rather, Hirschkind focused on the contrastive notions of reason and history embedded in the forms of politi cal contestation and mobilization in Islamic countries like Egypt. Charles Hirschkind, "Heresy or Hermeneutics: The Case of Nasr Hamid Ab? Zayd," The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, 12 (1995): 463-77; republished in Stanford Humanities Review 5, 1 (1995): 35-48. A transition to the content analysis of Ab? Zayd's theory of the Qur'?nic hermeneutics has been made by the two Indonesian scholars: Moch Nur Ichwan, "A New Horizon in Qur'anic Hermeneutics: Nasr Hamid Ab? Zayd's Contribution to Critical Qur'?nic Scholarship," M.A. Thesis, Leiden University, (Unpublished, 1999), and Yusuf Rahman, "The Hermeneutical Theory of Nasr Hamid Ab? Zayd: An Analytical Study of His Method of Interpreting the Qur'?n," Ph.D. Dissertation, McGill University, (Unpub lished, 2001).

A research question needs to be asked: What is the particular set of ideas and concepts that constitutes the chief founda tion of a humanistic hermeneutics of the Qur'an? This article is meant to address such a question by offering the particular set of ideas and concepts: First, a hermeneutic definition of the Qur'an signifies a shift of emphasis away from defining the Qur'?n as transcendent and meta physical to humanistic terms. The Qur'an is no longer defined as the eternal Speech of God kept in the Preserved Tablet in Arabic letters. Instead, Ab? Zayd provides what I consider humanistic definitions of the Qur'?n as "created Speech of God" {kal?m All?h makhl?q) in the human world,4 a "linguistic text" {nass lughaw?),5 a "human text" {nass insani),6 a "product of culture" (muntaj thaq?f?), a "producer of culture" {muntijan li al-thaq?fa)J and a "historical text" {nass t?r?kh?)} Second, a hermeneutic act concerning language is humanistic because Ab? Zayd regards Arabic as the human language of revelation in Islam.9 As an intended consequence of revelation in a humanly comprehen sible language, the Qur'an was and continues to be recited in Arabic. If revelation and recitation are in the human language of the addressee(s), Ab? Zayd would rethink the origin of language as the product of human invention and convention (istildh).10 Third, Ab? Zayd offers a more humanistic hermeneutics of revelation as an "act of communication" between two parties who are (1) humans, for example in pre-Islamic poetry and the Qur'an; (2) humans and the jinn; and (3) God and humans in three different manners, either "by 4) Ab?

Revelation is no longer a relationship of two or even three parties; but is a "four-person-relation": God, Gabriel, Muhammad and the human.12 Finally, Ab? Zayd addresses the text's encounter with the human interpreter through the act of interpretation. A turn to the relative mode of human interpretation is one way of his hermeneutic struggles against the claims of absolute interpretation, the dangers of absolute authority, and the sovereignty of "men of religion" with their own biases and ideological interests. Against these trends of non-humanistic interpre tation, Ab? Zayd offers a Valid interpretation through a "recurring movement" between the two dimensions of the meaning of the text in the past and its significance in the present context.13 This article will conclude by seeking the intellectual origin and distinctiveness of Ab? Zayd s humanistic hermeneutics. Toward Humanistic Definitions of the Qur?n Let me start with the hermeneutic act of defining the Qur5an with a humanistic orientation. A definition of the Qur'an is humanistic in so far as it stands in negotiated distinction to the transcendent and meta physical. The Qur'an is no longer defined as the eternal Speech of God (kal?m Allah) kept in the Preserved Tablet (fi l-lawh al-mahf?z) in Ara bic letters (bi-l-hur?fal-arabiyya). A belief in the eternity of the Qur'?n, as co-eternal with God, is not relevant to this humanistic definition. My inquiry is an attempt to find a new vocabulary and way of thinking about the Qur'an that does not always depend upon transcendent and metaphysical concepts. My close reading of Mafh?m al-nass and many of his other works reveals that Ab? Zayd meets the criteria for the u) Ab?

Zayd disagrees with interpreters who place excessive reliance upon "the divine dimension of the Qur'an at the expense of acknowledging its human characteristic."14 Reliance upon the divine dimension is meta physical, not humanistic. As a pious Muslim, however, he still believes in the metaphysical state of the Qur'?n as divine in origin. The point of contestation in his humanistic inquiry is not the metaphysical state of the Qur'?n in the pre-existent world. Rather, he is primarily inter ested in a humanistic inquiry of the Qur3an as it is actually manifested in the created, historical world of humans. This is my assessment of the purpose of his humanistic definitions of the Qur'an. Although his def initions are rather short and scattered throughout his works, there is a common humanistic thread. In what follows, I have sought to recon struct his scattered definitions in a relatively coherent manner. A self-proclaimed neo-Muctazilite thinker, Ab? Zayd first defines the Qur'an as the created Speech of God in the human world as opposed to the eternal Speech of God.15 As the created Speech of God, the Qur'an is an attribute of the divine acts (sif?t al-afdl), not an attribute of the divine essence (al-dh?t al-il?hiyya). The attributes of the divine essence do not actually manifest themselves in the historical world of reality, but the divine acts do. If the Qur'?n is the Speech of God {al-kal?m al-il?h?), and the Speech itself is an act (fit), then the Qur'?n is an historical phenomenon (z?hira t?r?khiyyd) on the grounds that all divine acts happen in this created world (fi l-?lam al-makhl?q) and are generated (muhdath).16 The historicity of the Qur'an represents a con crete manifestation of God s speech in the human world. The manifestation of God's speech in the human world motivates me to compare Ab? Zayd's definition of the Qur'an as the created Speech of God to Jesus (al-Masih) in Christianity. If the Qur'an is defined as the Speech of God, Ab? Zayd states that Jesus was a Mes senger of God (ras?l Allah) and manifestation of His Speech (wa-kali 14) Ab? Zayd with Esther R. Nelson, Voice of an Exile: Reflections on Islam (Westport, Con necticut: Praeger, 2004), 57. 15) Abu Zayd, al-Tafkirfizaman al-takfir, 200. 16) Ab? Zayd, al-Nass wa-l-sulta wa-l-haq?qa: Ir?dat al-ma(rifa wa-ir?dat al-haymana (Bei rut: al-Markaz al-Thaq?f? al-cArab?, 2000), 75.</page><page sequence="7">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 187 matuh?i) in the human world.17 This is how he interprets the Qur'?nic verse: "The Messiah Jesus son of Mary was a Messenger of God and His Speech..." (al-Nisa74:171). The human dimension of the Qur'an is also reflected in another s?ra: "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Speech from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary... " (al-Tmr?n/3:45). If the Qur'an is the Speech of God bestowed upon the Prophet Muhammad, writes Ab? Zayd, then Jesus is also the Speech of God bestowed upon Mary and a Spirit proceeding from Him (al-Nis?V4:171).18 Mary is placed in equal status with Muhammad. And the transmitter in both instances is clear in one regard: He is the angel Gabriel who revealed himself in the form of a "human in all respects" (basharan sawiyyan) to Mary (Maryam/19:17) and in the form of "an Arab of the dessert" or "a Bedouin" (s?rat dr?b?) to Muhammad. Accordingly, for Abu Zayd, both the Qur'?n and Jesus can adequately be defined in terms of the Speech of God, manifest as "a created human" (makhl?q bashar?, i.e. Jesus) and into a linguistic text in a human lan guage {lugha bashariyya, i.e. "an Arabic Qur'an").19 The manifestation of the Qur'an, as the Speech of God, as a "linguis tic text" (nass lughatut) is the subsequent humanistic definition of the QurJan. In his preface to Mafh?m al-nass, Ab? Zayd begins with the hermeneutic act of defining the Qur'an as a "linguistic text,"20 whose textual status is just like that of other linguistic texts in human civili zation.21 Its divine origin does not require humans to possess a par ticular body of God-based knowledge. Once the Qur'?n was sent down to the prophet Muhammad in a humanly comprehensible language (Arabic), argues Ab? Zayd, it was transformed into a "linguistic text," and became subject to the general rules (al-qaw?n?n al-?mmct) that produce other linguistics texts in a specific language (al-lugha), culture {al-thaq?f?), and reality (al-w?qt).22 A text is placed in "the dialectical relationship" i^al?qa jadaliyya) between the Qur'an as text and the culture and reality to which the text belongs and which it embodies. 17) Ab?

If the Qur'?n is a "linguistic text," and its understanding is enlarged by the human discursive dialogue with culture and reality, then Abu Zayd rightly defines the Qur'?n as a "human text" (nass insan?) P His starting point is to fully recognize the original state of the Qur'?n as a definite and fixed religious text according to its uttered form or its lit eral wording {min haythu mant?qih?). Its fixity is part of an attribute of the absolute (al-mutlaq) and of the sacred (al-muqaddas). However, continues Ab? Zayd, the Qur'?n loses its fixity and changes into a comprehensible concept or a human text once it has been subjected to human reason (al-(aqlal-ins?ni) .26 The subjection of the text to human reason started from the very moment of revelation when the Prophet received a divine text, recited it in a human language (Arabic), and interpreted it according to his human reason. Ever since, writes Ab? Zayd, the text has changed from its original existence as a "divine text", and become a humanly comprehensible text, because it changed from revelation (al-tanzit) to interpretation (al-ta! wit) }7 It seems obvious to me that Ab? Zayd considered the moment of revelation as the conceal break in the historical formation of the Qur'?n as a "human text." Once the Qur'?n changed into a "human text," it became subject to rules of human understanding and interpretation. The manifestation of the Speech of God into "the created Qur'?n", a "linguistic text", and subsequently a "human text", is rooted in Ab? Zayd s idea that the Qur'?n is embodied in human language, culture, and reality. Its embodiment is just one side of the emergence of the Qur'?n as a text, as being a "product of culture" (muntaj thaq?fi) that 23) Ab? Zayd, Mafli?m al-nass, 9. 24) Ibid. 25) Ab?

Once the Qur'?n entered into the history of seventh-century Arabian society, it marked a turning point in the formation of the Qur'an as a "historical text" (nass tarikhi)50 subject to historical understanding and interpreta tion. What he means by the term "historicity" is "al-hud?thfil-zam?ri':31 refers to the revelation of the Qur'?n over more than twenty years. It was a gradual response {munajjaman) to the concerns and needs of the Prophet and his community in a particular time and space, rather than a single and complete act of revelation. A Humanistic Hermeneutics of the Language of Revelation Next, I continue to argue that Ab? Zayd s hermeneutics is distinctively humanistic because he regards Arabic as the human language of revela tion in Islam.32 At the moment of revelation, God sent down His divine message to the Prophet Muhammad in a clear, humanly comprehen sible language. God Himself makes it clear in the following s?ra(s): "We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his own peo ple, in order to make (things) clear to them" (Ibr?h?m/14:4), and "in a clear Arabic language" (al-ShucaraV26: 195). The sura Ibr?h?m (14:4) reveals how God sent each messenger (ras?t) to a specific people (qawrri) with the language of his own people {bi-lis?n qawmih?). Ab? Zayd claims that s?ra as sufficient proof of the adjust ment of God s revelation to the human language of the addressee(s), as stated: "So when we talk about God communicating with humanity, what we have in the Qur'?n is human language. The Word of God 28) Ab? Zayd, Mafh?m al-nass, 24f. 29) Ibid., 178. 30) Ab? Zayd, "Divine Attributes in the Qur5?n: Some Poetic Aspects," 197. 31) Ab? Zayd, al-Nass wa-l-sulta wa-1-haq?qa, 71. 32) Ab? Zayd, Ma??m al-nass, 42.</page><page sequence="10">190 Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 needed to adapt itself -become human? because God wanted to com municate to human beings. If God spoke God-language, human beings would understand nothing."33 The choice of the human language strongly suggests that God wanted to communicate His divine message to humanity. As one of His messengers, God sent Muhammad to the Arabs with the clear language of his own people (bi-lisdn 'arabiyyin mub?n) (al-Shucar?726: 195). The expression "bi-lis?n qawmihf can be ade quately explained by reference to another Qur'?nic expression: bi-lis?n 'arabiyyin mub?n. What is recently considered in Western scholarship as a proof of self-referentiality in the Qur'an34 becomes valid evidence for Ab? Zayd to establish his raison d'etre for calling revelation in Islam a linguistic phenomenon.35 When God revealed His divine message to the Prophet Muhammad, He adjusted and used the linguistic system (niz?m lughaw?) of the addressee(s) (Arabic) known to both the Prophet and his Arab people.36 I now undertake to relate his defense of Arabic as the human lan guage of revelation both to the recitation of the Qur'?n and the recur ring phrase "qur'?nan 'arabiyyan ("an Arabic Qur5an") that occurs six times in the Qur'an. As an intended consequence of revelation in a clear human language, the Qur'an was and continues to be recited m Arabic. In order to better locate Ab? Zayd s position, I describe the range of opinions among Muslim scholars on the original meaning of the Qur'?n. In the classical studies of the Qur'?nic sciences entitled al-Itq?n fi (ul?m al-Qu^?n, the prolific scholar Jal?l al-D?n al-Suy?t? has explored vari ous original meanings and derivations of the Arabic word al-Qur?n in the opinions of the Muslim scholars:37 The first consists of scholars such as Ibn Kath?r, al-Sh?fic?, and others who argue that the word al-qur'?n is a proper noun without a root, a 33) Ab? Zayd with Esther R. Nelson, Voice of an Exile, 97. 34) Stefan Wild (ed.), Self-Referentiality in the Qur'an (Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz, 2006), 44, 136. 35) Ab?

Muhammad Ab? al-Fadl Ibr?h?m (Beirut: al-Maktaba al-cAsriyya, 1997), vol. 1, I46f.</page><page sequence="11">Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 191 specific for the Speech of God, and a name for His Scripture, just like al-tawrdt and al-injil. The second includes some of the Ash?arites who rely on the verbal noun (masdar) al-qurdn without hamza, derived from the verb qarana, "to connect, link, join, draw, etc.,") on the grounds that it connects together the suwar (pi. of s?rd), the ?y?t (pl. of ?ya\ verse) and the hur?f(pl. of harfi letter). The third is reflected in the opinion of al~FarraJ for the preferred notion of al-Qur'dn as the plural noun al-Qardin because its verses (al-?y?t) verify each other and resem ble each other. The fourth is presented by al-R?ghib who states that the word is named as such because it collects together the positive aspects of the revealed scriptures of the past. Where does Ab? Zayd stand? Of the various original meanings and derivations of the Qur5?n, Ab? Zayd prefers to regard it as a verbal noun (masdar) with hamza (Qur'dn) which is derived from the verb qarda, "to recite, read".38 This suggests that Ab? Zayd relies on the original meaning of the word Qur'dn as "recitation," or al-Qur'dn as "the recitation". Shortly after the revelation of the Qur'?n in the human language of the addressee (Arabic), the Qur'?n was recited and continues to be recited in Arabic, too. The recur ring phrase "qurydnan larabiyyari" ("an Arabic Qur'an") that occurs six times in the Qur'?nic s?ras becomes clear evidence that these revealed texts are intended to be recited in Arabic (Yus?f/12:2; al-Zukhruf/43:3; T?h?/20:113; al-Sh?r?/42:7; Fussilat/4l:3; and al-Zumar/39:28).39 If revelation and recitation are in the human language of the addressee(s), it seems reasonable for Ab? Zayd to rethink the origin of language (mabdd al-lugha) as the product of human invention and convention (istildh).40 This idea does not emerge in a socio-historical vacuum, but rather in response to the proponents and partisans of "lit eral interpretation" who believe that the origin of the Arabic language was a divine creation and gift to humans. Here Ab? Zayd relates the origin of language to the discourse of theology (kaldm). A theological debate surrounding the question of language being a divine gift stems from a specific verse of the Qur'an: "And He taught Adam the names 38) Ab? Zayd, Majh?m al-nass, 52; William A. Graham, "The Earliest Meaning of'Qur'an'", Die Welt des Islams, XXIII-XXIV (1984): 364. 39) Daniel A.

Proponents and partisans of the "literal interpretation" have interpreted that verse as a significant proof of the divine origin of language, where the process of naming "all things" is fully determined by God only. Among the liter alists, Ab? Zayd points out, is Ab? al-Hasan al-Ashcar? who is the first Muslim scholar to advance the divine origin of language (tawqif) to the nature of the Qur'an as "eternal speech of God" (kal?m All?h ghayr makhl?q).AX His opinion has greatly influenced the partisans of Ash'arism who believe in the eternity of the Qur'an in Arabic word ing. To the literalists, Ab? Zayd poses the question: if the process of naming "all things" is fully determined by God, isn't the notion of anthropomorphism (tashbih) confirmed?42 He himself stands on the metaphorical theological tradition of the Mu'tazilites concerning this s?ra. He refers to the Muctazilite literary theorist and the great classical humanist al-J?hiz (d. 255/869), who argued that: "It is not possible for Him to teach Adam the name and put aside the meaning {al-mdna), to teach him the signifier (al-dal?la) and not establish for him the sig nified (al-madl?lcalayh)."A? Accordingly, the relationship between the signifier and the signified is fully determined by human convention. And the Arabic language, in final analysis, is nothing but the product of human invention and convention. His affinity to the theological tradition of the Muctazilites comes as no surprise. As a neo-Muctazilite thinker, Ab? Zayd intends to revive the Mu'tazilite theory of the human origin of language and its rela tion to the Qur'an in his quest for a humanistic understanding of the Qur'an. As Ab? Zayd notes, "their analysis (the Mu'tazilites') of the relation between human, language, and the Qur'an concentrates on humans as the addressees of the text, and on human society as the 41) Ibid., 76. 42) Ibid, 72. 43) Abu Zayd, "The Dilemma of the Literary Approach to the Qur'an," Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics, 23 (2003): 12; idem., al-Ittij?h al-aql?fi l-tafi?r, 111-116; For more discussion on the origin of language in the early Muslim discourse, see Bernard G.

Indeed, the humanistic dimension of the Qur'?n is revealed in the sphere of language. A Humanistic Hermeneutics of Revelation An interpretation of revelation (wahy) also demonstrates that Ab? Zayd s hermeneutics is distinctively humanistic. Against the most com mon tendency to rely on a one-sided process of revelation, I argue that Ab? Zayd, under the influence of Russian semioticist Yuri [Jurij] M. Lotman, offers a more humanistic hermeneutics of revelation as an "act of communication" i^amaliyyat ittis?i) between a sender (mursil) and a receiver {mustaqbit) through a specific code {shifra kh?ssa) or a system of signs known to both parties.45 In this regard, Ab? Zayd renders the term wahy into three different types of communication. The first refers to his interpretation of wahy as an act of communica tion (^amaliyyat ittis?i) between two parties (tarafayn: mursil-sender and mustaqbil-receiver) that contains mysterious and hidden information (llaman khafiyyan sirriyyan).46 This type of interpretation enables Ab? Zayd to comprehend the phenomenon of wahy in both pre-Islamic poetry and the Qur'an itself. He points to the well-known odes of the poet Alqama al-Fahl as an example of wahy in pre-Islamic poetry. "He speaks to her (y?hi ilayh?) with the ostrich and clacking sounds, just like the Greeks speak with each other in an unintelligible language in their castles."47 According to him, the meaning of y?hi, a verbal form 44) Ibid., 36. 45) It is worth noting that Abu Zayd is a rare scholar in his creative borrowing of modern semiotics. Before the publication o?Mafh?m al-nass (1990), he had already translated into Arabic semiotics works by the Russian semioticist Yuri [Jurij] M. Lotman. It is no surprise that he acknowledges a debt to Lotman whose concept of art as a means of communication between sender and receiver of a message through a system of signs left a deep impact on him. See his translation of works on Lotman in Ab? Zayd and Ishr?f S?z? Q?sim trans, and ed., Anzimat al-al?m?t fi l-lugha wa-l-adab wa-1-thaq?fa: Madkhal il? al-simy?t?q? (Cairo: Dar Ily?s al-'Asriyya, 1986). 46) Ab? Zayd, Mafh?m al-nass, 32f. 47) Ibid, 32.</page><page sequence="14">194 Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 of wahy, indicates the act of communication ((amaliyya ittis?i) between two parties (the male and female ostrich) who speak with each other by means of a specific code ?inq?d'and 'naqnaqd as shifra kh?ssa).4s It is just like the Greeks who speak to each other in their own unintelli gible language (ratana literally means "to speak in an unintelligible language").49 No one understands the content of information except the two parties involved in the act of communication. Ab? Zayd finds a similar concept of wahy in the Qur'?n, which conveys an inter-human communication between two parties, i.e. Zakariyy? and his people, by means of known signs.50 "So Zakariyy? came out to his people from his chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allahs praises in the morning and in the evening" (Maryam/ 19:11). While Zakariyy? is speechless for three days, he speaks with his people by means of mysterious signs (ramzan) known only to sender and receiver (al-Tmr?n/3:4l). If the first type of wahy represents an act of communication between two parties who are human, the second type is concerned with wahy as an act of human communication with the jinn {ittis?i al-bashar bi-l jinn). It was common among Arabs of pre-Islamic culture to have famil iarity with poetry (al-sh?r) and soothsaying (al-kih?na). Since the worlds of humans ??lam al-bashar) and jinn (^?lam al-jinn) were closely bound up before the rise of Islam, argues Ab? Zayd, Arabs imagine that there was the possibility of communication between human and jinn.51 A certain poet (sh?cir) and soothsayer (k?hin) had a special ability to con tact the jinn. In his account of this story, Ab? Zayd describes poetry of the great pre-Islamic poet Maym?n b. Qays al-Acsh? (570-625 A.D.) who had special communication with his jinn called Mishal. The poetry itself begins with a description of how the jinn Mishal bestows upon the poet the word (al-qawl) so that he can speak. It certainly confirms the notion of wahy as an act of human communication with the jinn. As the communication occurs, the quality of communication epito mizes an intimate personal friendship between two parties (sharik?n 48) Ibid. 49) Hans Wehr, Arabic-English Dictionary: The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, ed. J.M. Cowan (Ithaca, New York: Spoken Language Services, Inc., 1976), 345. 50) Ab? Zayd, Mafhum al-nass, 32. 51) Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 195 f?m? baynan? min haw?da) where the jinn Mishal serves as the super natural inspirer of the poet.52 If the Arabs already knew that the jinn could communicate with the poet and inspire his poetry, then they could easily comprehend the coming of an angel who sent a 'revelation down to the Prophet. Accord ingly, for Ab? Zayd, interpreting wahy as the act of human communi cation with the jinn provides one way of articulating the cultural foundation of revelation in Islam. Without precedents in pre-Islamic culture, the Arabs would have faced serious difficulty in receiving the phenomenon of revelation in Islam. In fact, Ab? Zayd contends, they raised no objections to the phenomenon of the Qur'anic revelation itself (nuz?l al-Qur'dn); rather, their objections were directed against the content of revelation (madm?n kal?m al-wahy) or its recipient.53 It is no surprise that the people of Mecca often compared the newly revealed texts with the existing texts within Arab culture, both poetry and soothsaying. If the first type of wahy represents an act of communication between two parties who are human, and the second deals with an act of human communication with the jinn, the final type refers to al-wahy bi-l Qur'?n as an act of communication between God and humans (al bashar) in three different ways, either "by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal, with Allahs permission, what Allah wills" (al-Sh?r?/42:51). In this regard, Ab? Zayd divides three different manners of revelation in the QurJ?n. (1) Wahy is understood as inspiration (al-ilh?m), such as wahy to Moses mother (al-Qasas/28:7). The notion of wahy here is to signify "speech without word" (kal?m bid?ni qaw?), or "code-speech without sound" (kaldm bi-shifra ghayr sawtiyya).54 (2) Wahy is the means of speaking "from behind a veil". This usually refers to verbal communication and God's speaking to Moses from behind the mount. Allah says: "And to Moses Allah spoke directly" (al-Nis?74:164). When Moses wants to see God by asking "O my Lord! Show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon you Thee," Allah replies: "By no means canst thou see Me (directly); but look upon the 52) Ibid., 34. 53) Ibid. 54) Ibid., 41.</page><page sequence="16">196 Sukidi / Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 mount, if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me. When his Lord manifested His glory on the mount, He made it as dust, and Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: 'Glory be to Thee! To Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe'" (al-Acr?f: 143). If the previous type of wahy denotes "speech without word", then Ab? Zayd argues that God s direct speech to Moses repre sents "speech with language" (kal?m bi-lugh?) so that Moses could eas ily comprehend His speech.55 And (3) wahy is verbal communication by messenger (ras?l). This is believed to be a channel of the Qur'anic revelation where God sent the Prophet as His messenger to convey His message to human and humanity in general. Following the eminent linguist Roman Jakobson,56 Ab? Zayd begins with a creative theorizing of the Qur'?n as a text (nass) that can be ana lyzed according to the scientific principles which apply to the analysis of any other texts. As a text, [wahy of] the Qur'an describes itself as a message (risala) sent down by the addresser (mursil as the sender) to the addressee (mustaqbil as the receiver) in a specific context (al-w?q?). In the transmission of a message, the information (al-tl?m) contained in it must be transmitted via a code (shifra) or linguistic system (niz?m lughaw?) known to both sender and receiver. The process itself is the channel of conveying the message called the contact (^al?qat ittis?l).57 Thus, Ab? Zayd proposes the following schema58 as a way of arguing what I consider a humanistic hermeneutics of revelation in the Qur'?n. 55) Ibid. 56) Ab? Zayd is clearly under the influence of the eminent linguist Roman Jakobson (Rus sia, 1896-1982). He has learned how Jakobson created a self-theorizing of the six constitu tive elements in any verbal act of communication: addresser, addressee, message, code, context, and contact. For Jakobson, the act of communication begins with the addresser who sends a message to the addressee. The information contained in a message needs to be transmitted into a system of signs, called the code known to both the addresser (the encoder) and the addressee (the decoder) in the specific context. In the transmission process, there is the means of conveying the message, something called the contact which links together the addresser and the addressee.

Sebeok (New York and London: The Technology Press of MIT and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1960), 353. 57) The practice of theorizing the concept of the Qur'?n as a text and its function as a com munication model is summarized from Ab?

Bear in mind that God as the sender is not an object of scholarly inquiry; rather, Ab? Zayd is primarily interested in the questions of how and what was sent down to the human world. What attracts my scholarly interest is to explain why the term tanzil is used by Ab? Zayd for the first process of revelation. Although the term remains mostly unexplored in his works, I argue that the schema can actually be under stood if one starts with the verbal root, which is derived from the verb nazala: "to cause to come down", and "to send down".59 Seen from this etymological root, the usage of the term tanzil is a way of arguing for the concept of "coming down" and "sending down" in the process of revelation. As the designated term, tanzil \s drawn in the vertical line. The schema becomes even clearer when it is understood in terms of what the German scholar Stefan Wild calls the space of tanzil, by which 59) Wehr, Arabic-English Dictionary, 956.</page><page sequence="18">198 Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 "there is an above and a below".60 Indeed, God and Gabriel stand on two different levels of being. The first stands above, on the highest level of being, and the second stands below, on a lower level of being. Applied to an understanding of Ab? Zayd s schema, the phenomenon of revela tion in Islam begins with God (above) who sent the angel Gabriel (Jibr?t) down (below) as an intermediary or contact i^al?qat ittis?t) in the pro cess of "sending down" (tanz?t) His divine message to Muhammad (below), as the receiver (mustaqbil) or the addressee (mukh?tab). It is stated in the Qur'?n: "We sent down the Qur'an in truth, and in truth has it descended" (al-Isr?717:105). Ab? Zayd poses the following questions: What was sent down by Gabriel from the Qur'?n? Was it the word and the meaning, i.e. the text with its content and its form, or was it the content, the meaning, and 'the substance', and then the messenger put it into the garb of the Arabic language? In other words, was the communication between Gabriel and Muhammad "wahy" in the sense of inspiration or speech (linguistic expression)?61 In response to these questions, Ab? Zayd describes three general opin ions among the 'ulama' with regard to the intermediary role of the angel Gabriel in the process of "sending down" the Qur'?nic revelation: The first opinion argues for both the word (al-lafz) and the meaning (al-mdna) in which "Gabriel memorized the Qur'?n from the Preserved Tablet and then sent it down 61 In the pre-existent world, the Qur'an was written down and kept in the Preserved Tablet (ft l-lawh al-mahjuz) in Arabic letters (bi-l-hur?fal-1 arabiyyd). It suffices to say that Ab? Zayd argues against this opinion because it represents the orthodox belief in the metaphysical "sacredness of the text" (qad?sat al-nass) ,63 The second opinion argues that "Gabriel sent the meanings (al-md?n?) down to Muhammad, taught the meanings, and that then Muhammad 60) Wild, "We have sent down to thee the book with the truth..."

Abd Allah al-Zarkash?, al-Burh?n fi (ul?m al-Qur?n, ed.

If Gabriel sent the meanings down upon the heart of Muhammad via a non-linguistic code (ghayr al-shifra al-lughawiyya), Ab? Zayd regards it as an inspiration (al-ilhdm) using "a specific code without sound" (shifra khdssa ghayr sawtiyya).65 But what most interests him is the next step. That is the transformative process of revelation (tahwll al-wahy) from the stage of inspiration (al-ilhdm) to the linguistic contact (al-ittisdl al-lughawi) when Muham mad expressed the spirit of the divine revelation in a clear, humanly Arabic language.66 The third opinion argues that "Gabriel delivered the meaning, ex pressed the words in the language of the Arabs, and the inhabitants of the sky recited it in the Arabic language, and then, Gabriel sent it down to Muhammad in Arabic too").67 Gabriel has a linguistic system (nizdm lughaw?), known as the Arabic language. It is presumably that, in the initial stage of sending down from God to Gabriel, the Qur'an uses a non-linguistic text (nassghayr lughawi), which is then transformed into a linguistic text in the process of revelation from Gabriel to Muham mad.68 Gabriel to Muhammad: wahy as "revelation" In the next stage of revelation, Ab? Zayd s original schema can further be schematized as follows: 64) Ibid., 44. 65&gt; Ibid. 66&gt; Ibid. 67) Ibid. 68) Ibid., 45.</page><page sequence="20">200 Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 This schema informs readers how Ab? Zayd extends revelation into a "three-person-relation God as the source of revelation, Gabriel as the intermediary agent, and Muhammad as the receiver of His message. The relation between God and Gabriel is drawn in the vertical line, precisely to express the notion of tanzil as the process of "sending down" from God (above) to Gabriel (below). No argument is made in many of Ab? Zayd s works to distinguish the concept of tanzil drawn in the vertical line from the notion of wahy drawn in the horizontal line. This may be a weak point in his analysis. One can only assume that, as Ste fan Wild notes, "whereas wahy may occasionally also be used for inter human communication, tanzil (and Hnz?t) are never used in this way but are reserved for divine communication with man".69 If Wild s con cept of tanzil is applied, this presupposes the idea that God communi cated His divine message to the Prophet through an intermediary in the form of the angel Gabriel. Considering that the spatial distance between Gabriel and Muhammad is not much greater than the distance between God and Gabriel, it is feasible that Gabriel and Muhammad might encounter each other through revelation {wahy). The encounter becomes clearer if one follows Ab? Zayd s critical attitude toward two different process of revelation. In the first opinion, the Prophet divested himself of human form {s?rat al-bashariyya) and transformed into angelicality (s?rat al-malak iyya) in order to receive the divine message.70 The communication car ries no linguistic contact because it uses a "code of speech" (ramz min al-kal?m), which greatly affects the quality of what the Prophet hears "as the ringing of the bell."71 This is how Ab? Zayd interprets the hadith: "Al-H?rith b. Hish?m asked the prophet Muhammad and said: How does revelation {wahy) come to you? He replied: At times, it comes to me as the ringing of the bell, and that is the most painful for me. When it (stops and) leaves me, I have retained or understood what was said." The hadith reports how the prophet hears something "like the ringing of the bell," indistinct words, and in the form of noise (al-dawi). The reliance of contact is based on an auditory perception (h?sat al-sarr?), 69) Wild, "We have sent down to thee the book with the truth...", 138. 70) Abu Zayd, Ma??m al-nass, 46. 71) Ibid., AG?.</page><page sequence="21">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 201 which signifies the status of Muhammad as "an auditory type of prophet".72 In the second opinion, Gabriel divested himself of the form of angel icality and took on human form in order to give the divine message to the Prophet.73 This corresponds with a continuation of the above hadith: "At other times, the angel comes to me in the form of a man, speaks to me, and I comprehend what the angel says." Ab? Zayd supports this opinion for one reason. The meaning of wahy is communicated to the Prophet (mustaqbit) through the angel Gabriel with "the linguistic sys tem of humans" {bi-1-niz?m al-lughawi al-bashari, i.e. Arabic).74 It enables the Prophet to comprehend what the angel Gabriel says. He is indeed called "a visual type of prophet"75 since he sees the speaker who appears to him in the form of a man (rajul) and then speaks to him in a clear, humanly comprehensible language. This particular instance reveals how the manner of wahy, distinct from tanzll ("sending down"), transcends spatial significance. The spatial relation between Gabriel and the Prophet becomes blurred. Most interestingly, however, Ab? Zayd does not limit his analysis to revelation as a "three-person-relation." Muhammad to People: bal?ghIHndh?r In the ultimate stage of revelation, Ab? Zayd offers a comprehensive schema as follows: V 72) Ibid.; Izutsu, God and Man in the Koran, 177. 73) Ab? Zayd, Mafh?m al-nass, 46. 74) /??? 75) Izutsu, God and Man in the Koran, 177.</page><page sequence="22">202 Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 This schema informs readers how Ab? Zayd defines the concept of revelation as a "four-person-relation": God-^Gabriel-^Muhammad~^the human.76 God sends His divine words down to Gabriel (tanzil). Both Gabriel and Muhammad are intimately bound up with the same func tions as receiver and transmitter. As receiver, Gabriel receives God s divine words, and, as transmitter, he transmits them, with His permis sion, to the prophet Muhammad (wahy, ris?ia). Just like Gabriel, as receiver, Muhammad receives His divine words through the medium of Gabriel (wahy as mediated revelation), and, as transmitter, he trans mits them to the people (baldgh, Hndh?r).77 Muhammad is not the ultimate addressee of revelation, because he is obliged to pass on the divine words. And only by virtue of being "the transmitter" of divine words to the people (bal?gh or tabligh means "transmission"), is he called messenger' (al-M?3ida/5:67; al-Ancam/6:19; Ibr?h?m/l4:52; al-Tmr?n/3:20; al-Anbiy?V21:106).78 I conclude that Ab? Zayd s concept of revelation is defined with reference to a "four-person-relation:" God^Gabriel-&gt;Muhammad-&gt;the human. It suffices to argue that neither Gabriel nor Muhammad can be defined as the ultimate addressee of revelation. Since Muhammad is simply the first addressee (al-mukhdtab al-awwal), it becomes clear that Ab? Zayd's hermeneutic act is humanistic because he regards the human (al-nds) and all humankind (al-nds jam?an) as the ultimate addressees of revelation in Islam.79 Revelation, in its final process of communication, is bound up with the multitude of addressees (mukhd tab?n), i.e.; "the human" (al-nds), "children of Adam" (bani Adam), 76) The above schema arises from Abu Zayd s personal and intellectual interaction with the Japanese linguistic scholar of the Qur'an Izutsu. This influence dates from March 1985 to July 1989 when Ab? Zayd served as invited visiting professor in the Department of Arabic at Osaka University for Foreign Languages. After that experience, he began his Mafh?m al-nass (1990) along with his most controversial book Naqd al-khit?b al-d?n? (1992). In addition to his previous references to the works of such Russian semioticians as Lotman and Jakobson, Ab? Zayd has referred to Izutsus concept of revelation as a "four-person relation" that left a deep impact upon his thought. Ab? Zayd with Esther R. Nelson, Voice of an Exile, 103; idem, Mafh?m al-nass, 57; Izutsu, God and Man in the Koran, 177. 77) Ab?

I argue that Ab? Zayd s humanistic hermeneutics is founded on the encounter between the text as the object and the human inter preter as the subject in the hermeneutic act. The text s encounter with the human interpreter started at the moment of revelation in seventh century Arabian society when God communicated His divine text to Muhammad in a humanly comprehensible language. Ab? Zayd posits the hermeneutic role of the Prophet as the human interpreter of the Qur'an as a "divine text" (nass il?h?) in origin that undergoes a process of desacralization into a "concept" (mafh?m) or a "humanly compre hensible text" (nass insani?a "human text") by its changing from rev elation (al-tanzit) to interpretation (al-ta'wit).81 In other words: once the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet in a human language, it acquired a human existence as a "human text" and became subject to human understanding and interpretation. The text s encounter with the Prophet was the first human attempt to understand and interpret the text in a particular time and space. For Ab? Zayd, an understanding of the text by the Prophet as a human interpreter in seventh-century Arabia was the first of many encounters as a result of the text's encounter with human reason (bi-l-(aql al-bashari)*2 Believing that there are many encounters between the text and human interpreters over time and space, Ab? Zayd insists that an early understanding of the text by the Prophet is not fixed and absolute; rather, it must be regarded as "rela tive" (nisbi) and "changeable" (mutaghayyir) .83 Attributing relativity to human understanding and interpretation is the main feature of Ab? Zayd's humanistic hermeneutics of the Qur'an. Any effort to claim that the Prophet's understanding of the text is absolute (mutlaq) and sacred 80) Ibid. 81) Ab? Zayd, Naqd al-khit?b al-d?n?, 126. 82) Ibid. 83) Ibid.</page><page sequence="24">204 Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 (muqaddas), Ab? Zayd warns, falls into a sort of polytheism (shirk), because it associates the absolute (al-mutlaq) with the relative (al-nisbi); the fixed (al-th?bit) with the changeable (al-mutaghayyir); and the divine intent (al-qasd al-il?hi) with the human understanding (al-fahm ai-insani).84 A clear distinction between absolute and relative is a central point in Ab? Zayd s hermeneutic struggle against those who claim absolute authority (al-sulta al-mutlaqd) in the exegesis of religious texts (al-nus?s al-d?niyya). In his al-Tafkirfi zaman al-takfitr, Ab? Zayd begins with a clear distinction between "the primary text" (al-nass al-asli) and "the secondary text" (al-nass al-th?naw?). In Islamic heritage (tur?th), the primary text refers solely to the Qur'an; while the secondary text refers to the text of the Sunna, which often functions as a commentary on the primary text.85 Included in the other secondary texts are religious texts written by scholars ('ulama'), jurists (al-fiuqah?), and Qur'anic commentators (al-mufasirr?n); acting as commentaries of either the primary text or the secondary one. What happened in the history of Arabic-Islamic culture, Ab? Zayd argues, was that the secondary texts changed into the primary texts and acquired a new status as widely perceived authoritative texts within the Muslim community.86 The Qur'an, having lost its status as the primary text, was subsequently replaced by a new proliferation of secondary texts along with the hege monic authority of scholars, jurists, and commentators. And the sphere of intellectual reasoning itself (maj?l al-ijtih?d) was confined mostly to an understanding of the secondary texts without taking recourse to the primary text?the Qur'an.87 Ab? Zayd champions the call for liberation from "the authority of the texts" (sultat al-nus?s), a call that leads him to being accused of heresy. Actually, his call for liberation from "the authority of the texts" is not intended to liberate Muslims from either the primary text of the Qur'?n or the Sunna of the Prophet. Rather, for Ab? Zayd, it is intended to liberate Muslims from the absolute authority (al-sulta al-mutlaqd) of those who impose suppression (al-qamf), hegemony (al-haymand), 84) Ibid. 85) Ab? Zayd, al-Tafk?rfizaman al-takfir, 134. 86) Ibid. 87) Ibid., 135.</page><page sequence="25">Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 205 and supremacy (al-saytard) in the name of the religious texts, irrespec tive of any considerations of time, place, circumstances and conditions.88 This call for liberation from the dangers of absolute authority is directly related to his critique of ideological and political interpretations of the text. The latter is a version of what I consider a non-humanistic orien tation toward the text. The interpreter s relation to the text is considered non-humanistic because it is constructed in terms of a master-slave relationship. The masters of religious texts include scholars, jurists, and Qur'?nic commentators who have often claimed sole interpretive authority in order to control what Ab? Zayd calls "the slavery of the human in the name of the authority of religious texts" (^ub?diyyat al-ins?n 'ala sultat al-nus?s al-d?niyya) .89 A claim to absolute authority is manifest in the religious discourse of divine sovereignty (al-h?kimiyyd) and its relation to the text (al-nass). If divine sovereignty is defined in terms of the "authority to command absolute and unquestioned obedi ence, similar to a master commanding to a slave,"90 then Ab? Zayd has rightly criticized how divine sovereignty results in the sovereignty of "the men of religion" (rijdl al-din) who are actually human beings, masters of religious texts to be sure, but with their own biases and ideological inclinations.91 As the champion of reason (al-aql) over transmission (al-naql), Ab? Zayd prefers to use ta'wtl, the Arabic term for hermeneutics,92 rather 88) Ibid., 138. 89) Ab?

Zayd, Naqd al-khit?b al-d?ni, 56. 92) Ab? Zayd's dialogue between ta'wil and Western hermeneutics started in the late 1970s when he made a two-year sojourn to America (1978-1980), as part of an exchange program between Cairo University and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He was awarded a scholarship when he was working toward his PhD dissertation on the philo sophical hermeneutics of Ibn 'Arabi. He stated, "I owe much of my understanding of hermeneutics to opportunities offered me during my brief sojourn to the United States." Shortly after his return to Egypt in 1980, Ab? Zayd began to write a scholarly work on Hermeneutics and the Problem of Interpretation of the Text {al-Hirminy?tiq? wa-mu'dilat taf ?r al-nass). On his journey to the philosophy of hermeneutics and its history in Western literature, he discovered that "the Arabic word ta'wil closely approximates the English word hermeneutics." See his memoir, Abu Zayd with Esther R. Nelson, Voice of an Exile, 57. It is worth noting that the association of ta'wil as a hermeneutic term is not unique to Ab?</page><page sequence="26">206 Sukidi/Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 than the more common exercise of talwin ?which means the ideo logical interpretation of the text.93 If the interpreter is driven by a specific set of motives, biases, and ideological inclinations, then the meaning of the text is distorted and separated from the historical context from which the text originates in the first process.94 In opposi tion to the ideological approach, Ab? Zayd advocates epistemology (al-mdrifi) as the means to acquire "convincing truths" (al-haqdiq al-yaqiniyyd) in a particular time and space.95 This kind of truth is counted as "relative" and "changeable" due to the relative attributes of the human interpreters. Abu Zayd s notion of ta'wills rendered as an epistemological proce dure, as the method or art of human understanding and interpretation in the quest for the original meaning of the Qur'an. The encounter between tdwil and hermeneutics, or ta'wil as the Arabic term for herme neutics, may be clarified as follows. The notion of tdwil always invokes a sense of "returning to the origin [of the text]" (al-ruj?( il? l-asl)?6 which parallels the Greek word herm?neuein as "a movement of penetra tion into the intention of a text or message".97 Accordingly, both tdwil and hermeneutics are generally characterized by a return to "the origin" (al-asl) or "the first" {al-awwal). This raises a further substantial reflec tion on the question of how does the herm?ne?s or al-mu'awwildiscover "the origin" or "the first" order of meaning? In his response, Ab? Zayd approaches tdwil as "the discovery of the hidden meaning" (al-kashf can al-dal?la al-khafiyyd) based on "the movement of the interpreter s Zayd. Stetkevych also considers ta'wil as a hermeneutic term because it concerns primarily "covert, or virtual meaning, or it reduces meaning to its ultimate intent: it makes it return."

Zayd, Naqd al-khit?b al-d?ni, 178-185. 94) According to Ab? Zayd, the usage of talw?n is common to both Islamists such as Sayyid Qutb and modernists such as Muhammad Shahr?r, who are both ignorant of the histori cal meaning of the text. See further in Ab?

The first task of the human interpreter, insists Ab? Zayd, is to fully understand the historical meaning of the Qur'an (al-dal?la al-t?r?khiyya) within the social, historical, and cultural contexts of the first addresses of the text, i.e. the Prophet and his communities." Meaning (ma1 no) of the text may be valid and stable according to what the Prophet meant in the historical past. However, the significance (maghza) of the text may vary in the present context as a result of the text's encounters with the human interpreter or the reader in a different time and space. A subse quent task Ab? Zayd assigns to the human interpreter is to discover the changing character of significance of the text in the present context.100 To call the hermeneutic act the process of decoding the text, Ab? Zayd requires the human interpreter to extract the historical meaning of the text in the past that carries no significance in the present, and to recode it again in order to discover its significance in the present context.101 Ab? Zayd's hermeneutics rests upon the "productive reading" (al-qirda al muntija) that always involves a "recurring movement between the two dimensions of the origin (al-asl) and the goal (al-gh?ya) or between meaning (al-ma'na) and significance (al-maghz?)."102 A creative inter preter engages in both meaning in the past and significance in the pres ent in order to arrive at a Valid interpretation.' 98) Ab?

Hirsch who distinguishes the terms as follows: "Meaning is that which is represented by a text; it is what the author meant by his use of a particular sign sequence; it is what the signs represent. Significance, on the other hand, names a relationship between that meaning and a person, or a conception, or a situation, or indeed anything imaginable." See E.D.

Zayd's interpretative approach towards the QurJ?n is a distinctively "humanistic hermeneutics". My argument is founded on the particular set of ideas and concepts contained in Ma?f?m al-nass and many of his primary writings, mostly in Arabic. As I reconstructed Ab? Zayd s scattered definitions of the Qur'?n, I was surprised to find that none of his definitions of the Qur'?n are constructed with reference to transcendent and metaphysical concepts. Instead, the humanistic ideas and concepts are the most striking features of what I constitute as a set of humanistic definitions of the Qur'?n. Against the common orthodox belief in the eternity of the Qur'?n, Ab? Zayd has proposed the historicity of the Qur'an as manifestation of God s speech, His act in the human world which was then transformed into a "human text" at the moment when the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The historicity of the Qur'an is compared to his interpretation of Jesus as a Messenger of God and manifestation of His speech in the human world. Both are believed to be divine in ori gin, but human in manifestation. If God s speech does actually manifest itself in human language (Arabic), Ab? Zayd has rightly defined the Qur'?n as a "linguistic text". This definition inspires further reflection on his point of intellectual origins, which I trace back to the Egyptian humanist Am?n al-Kh?l? (1895-1966). "My real intellectual influence," Ab? Zayd himself acknowledges, "is Sheikh Am?n al-Kh?l?."103 If al-Kh?l? has approached the Qur'an as a literary text (nass adab?), Ab? Zayd approaches it as a linguistic text (nass lughawt). This is his intellectual answer to al-Kh?l? s call for the study of the Qur'?n (istij?ba li-l-ddwat al-Shaykh Amin al-Kh?l?).m Ab? Zayd intends to study the Qur'an as a "linguistic text" in reference to al-Kh?l?s study of the Qur'an as "the greatest Arabic book and its most influential literary work" (kit?b aUarabiyya al-akbar wa-atharuh? al-adab? al-dzam).m It reveals how Ab? Zayd shares a conception of the Qur'?n as a text in the Arabic language. Unlike 103) Abu Zayd, al-Ahram Weekly, June 22-28 (1995), 5. 104) Ab? Zayd, Mafh?m al-nass, 19. 105) Ibid., 9?; Am?n al-Kh?l?, Man?hij tajd?dfi l-nahw wa-l-bal?gha wa-l-tafi?r wa-l-adab (Cairo: al-Hay'a al-Misriyya al-?mma li-l-Kit?b, 1995), 229.</page><page sequence="29">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 209 al-Kh?l?, however, Ab? Zayd intends to achieve a 'scientific conscious ness' (wacy Hlm?) in his study of the Qur'?n without falling into the trap of ideological interest and inclination.106 If al-Kh?l? has defined the Qur'?n as a literary text in the Arabic literary language that can be studied like any other work of literature, Ab? Zayd has followed a similar path. He has defined the Qur'?n as a "linguistic text" with a status like any other text in human civilization.107 Its divine origin does not require humans to possess a particular body of God-based knowledge. Once the Qur'an was revealed to Muham mad, it acquired a human existence and became subject to the discur sive mode of human interpretation. As heir to the intellectual tradition of al-Kh?l?, Ab? Zayd is con cerned with the issue of language. His hermeneutic interpretation of language is a distinctively humanistic because Ab? Zayd regards Arabic as the human language of revelation. The Qur'an is intended to be recited in Arabic?as "an Arabic Qur'?n." In other words, the Arabness of the Qur5an is truly human, as the origin of the language is the prod uct of human invention and convention. If al-Kh?l? asked the human interpreter to fully understand the Arabness of the Qur'?n,108 Ab? Zayd suggests something similar by asking the human interpreter to take into consideration "the humanity of religious texts" (bashariyyat al-nus?s al-diniyyd), especially of the Qur'?n.109 Exploring Ab? Zayd's interpretation of revelation reveals another feature of his humanistic hermeneutics. He is primarily concerned with human beings who are actively involved in communication between a "two-person-relation" (i.e. between humans; humans with the jinn; God and humans), a "three-person-relation" (God-&gt; Gabriela Muham mad) and a "four-person-relation" (God^ Gabriels Muhammad-&gt; the human). Describing the Qur'?n as a "four-person-relation" is indeed the most striking feature of his orientation to the human and the whole of humanity as the ultimate addressees of revelation in Islam. The humanistic dimension of the Qur'?n is further evident in the process 106) Ibid., 11. 107) Ab? Zayd, Naqd al-khit?b al-d?n?, 206. 108) al-Kh?l?, Man?hij tajd?dfi l-nahw wa-l-bal?gha wa-l-tafi?r wa-l-adab, 229f. 109) Ab? Zayd, Naqd al-khit?b al-din?, 206.</page><page sequence="30">210 Sukidi / Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 of revelation that took a period of more than twenty years as a gradual response to situations, concerns, and needs of humanity. The central role of the human interpreter is the final characteristic of a humanistic hermeneutics of the Qur'?n. Since the absolute is solely an attribute of God, Ab? Zayd has posited the hermeneutic role of the Prophet as the human interpreter of the text and his relative mode of interpretation tied to specific time, space, circumstance, and condition. Identifying the relative mode of human understanding and interpreta tion is the main feature of Ab? Zayd s humanistic hermeneutics. This is an instance of his hermeneutic struggles against the claims of absolute interpretation, the dangers of absolute authority, and the sovereignty of the "men of religion" with their own biases and ideological interests. Against these trends of non-humanistic interpretation, I have argued that Ab? Zayd s understanding of ta'wil&amp;s hermeneutics has created an alternative possibility of seeking the original meaning of the text in the past and its significance in the present context. Ideally, the human inter preter should always engage in what Ab? Zayd speaks of as a "recurring movement" (haraka mutakarrira) between the two interrelated dimen sions of meaning and significance. A Valid interpretation is possible when the human interpreter understands the difference between those two dimensions and then relates significance in the present to meaning in the past in the process of interpretation. Finally, Ab? Zayd s "recurring movement" brings to mind the reform ist Fazlur Rahman (1919-1988), who introduced his "double move ment" theory of Qur'anic hermeneutics. In his Islam and Modernity, Rahman proposed a similar solution through "a double movement, from the present situation to Qur'?nic times, then back to the present."110 Rahmans Qur'?nic hermeneutics consists of the following steps: "one has to understand the import or meaning of a given statement by study ing the historical situation or problem to which it was the answer;" one has "to generalize those specific answers and enunciate them as state ments of general moral-social objectives that can be 'distilled' from specific texts in light of the socio-historical background and the often stated rationes legis" and finally, "the general has to be embodied in the 110) Fazlur Rahman, Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Chi cago: The University of Chicago Press, 1981; 1984), 5.</page><page sequence="31">Sukidi I Die Welt des Islams 49 (2009) 181-211 211 present concrete socio-historical context."111 For reasons not entirely clear to me, Ab? Zayd only rarely refers to Rahmans "double move ment" theory. More importantly, however, both he and Rahman have persuasively made a case for the hermeneutic study of the Qur'?n with a humanistic orientation. ni&gt; Ibid., 6f.</page></plain_text>
