Ivory, alabaster, gold, and other precious materials were sometimes used for deco ration, inlays or particular pieces such as bosses.

In some regions such as Alalakh, Nuzi or Mycenae, texts list different wood types, maybe attesting to the value of this product, whereas we have no such references in Ugarit, despite all the textual sources, see Vita 2008: 60. 10 Four-spoked wheels were probably more frequent in the Aegean, while the six-spoked wheels were more common in Egypt and the Near East, see Crouwel 1981: 81; Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 78-79. 11 Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 78. 12 See Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 78 for the different positions per period. 13 Crouwel 1981: 64. 14 Crouwel 1981: 60. 15 See Crouwel 1981: 63-70. This type is a pure Aegean creation, showing a high degree of standardization. 16 Crouwel 1981: 63. In the Mycenaean chariot ceramics, the wings are often filled with dots or other purely dec orative motives, see for instance V 129, V 137, or V 138 (Crouwel 1981: 66). The wings' function is not cer tain, but they were probably used as mudguards (Lit tauer 1972: 156) and not as racks or protection against fired weapons (CROUWEL 1981: 67). 17 Cf. below. 18 This feature is visible on a number of pictorial vase paintings and also on mural paintings and linear B ideograms from Knossos, cf. Crouwel 1981: 65. The axle - about 2 m wide and from 0.04 to 0.052 m diameter - provided the bases for the four or six-spoked wheels,10 that were fixed near the axle ends by linchpins of metal, wood or boiled leather (Fig. 6).11 The axel was located in a rear or near rear position.12 In the Aegean, Crouwel differentiated several types of chariots, but all of them had a D-shaped plan and were wide enough for two persons to stand abreast, as exemplified in terracotta models.13 The simplest one is the "box chariot", which appears rectangu lar when seen in profile and whose framework would have been closed by a combination of leather and thin sheet wood.14 The "dual chari ot",15 which developed out of the box chariot, had curved side extensions or "wings" added to the rear16 and a triangular spur17 extending under the wings.18 The "quadrant chariot" has a round pro</page><page sequence="6">72 Marian H.

The last type of chariot iden tified by Crouwel is the "rail chariot" 19 that appeared at the end of the period (13lh—12th BC), in the later developments of pictorial vase paint ings. This chariot is completely open-walled, with a rail, and does not possess wings at the rear. The draft pole ran under the center of the floor but was only in contact with it at its extremi ties,20 except in the Aegean, where chariots had to be adapted to local geographical conditions through the addition of a "reinforcing triangle" visible on terracotta models of dual chariots.21 This triangle was designed to consolidate a weak point of the vehicle: the place where the pole leaves the chariot's underside.22 Because of the dif 19 See Crouwel 1981: 70-74; Crouwel 2006b. 20 Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 76 and 80. 21 When compared to Near Eastern examples. 22 Äkerström 1987: 123. 23 Äkerström 1987: 123. 24 Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 85. 25 Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 84.

The Egyptians added a thong of leather to stiffen the connection between the chariot box and the pole,23 but the Aegean chari ot makers added an L-shaped element ("brace") connecting the pole and the horizontal stay-piece (connecting the chariot front and the yoke). The pair of horses was attached to the chariot by a pole through a yoke. The yoke was set near the end of the pole and was anchored either with lash ings or by a vertical yoke peg.24 The yoke itself had a depressed center and recurved extremities25 end ing in conic finials made out of stone or ivory. The saddle yoke had the form of an inverted Y to fit the horse's back. The "legs" lay along the horse's shoul ders, while the "stems" were lashed at the front of each yoke arm and terminated in a reel-shaped finial (or boss) also made of stone or ivory (Fig. 5).26 In archaeological contexts, the identification of the bosses and finials of chariots is based on par allels with actual pieces found on the Tutankha mun chariots27 and on New Kingdom Egyptian reliefs at el-Amarna and Thebes.28 Although this identification is highly probable, the use of these 26 Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 85. 27 See for instance, James 1974: 32-33; James &amp; McGovern 1993: vol. 1, 186; Caubet &amp; Yon 2001. 28 Especially the tomb of Pentu at el-Amarna, James 1974: 38; James &amp; McGovern 1993: vol. 1, 186; see also below in part 3.</page><page sequence="7">Objects of Prestige?

And in archaeological contexts such knobs were mostly found in odd numbers, which suggests more a use as a handle rather than as chariot fittings; see for instance below, the section on Ugarit, where in most cases one piece per house was found, except in Urtenu's house. Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 86-90. The "arcades" are visible on the chariot tablets from Knossos (n°883, 880 and 881), but also on the megaron fresco at Mycenae, cf. Äkerström 1978: 36-37; Aker strÖm 1987: 124. Caubet &amp;Yon 2001: 70. Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche 2008. Cf, for instance, RS 34.140, RS. 34.153, RS 34.161, etc. Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche 2008: 217. In the formulae, horses, when associated with an owner, are the king's horses or the queen's horses. We also have to note here that RS 86.12235 mentions the horses of Rashap and the horses of Milku-cAtjtarti (Bordreuil &amp; Pardee 2001: 354-356, n°39) and this can be paralleled by Egyptian representations of the same Levantines deities - Reshep and Astarte - riding horses, cf. notes 162, 314. Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche 2008: 227. Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche 2008: 228. Moreover, a text from Mari shows that horses and chariots took part in the religious procession of the Akitum festival in Assyria (Sas son 1969: 32; Dalley 1984: 161-162). The association of horses with chariots can be seen in texts such as the Amarna letters in which horses are sent along with chariots. Though hunting and war are attested by iconography, see for instance the gold dish RS 5.031. Its description and a discussion are addressed below by M.

Mariyannu typically appear high on lists of captured enemies. In the Anas tasi papyrus I, 18, 4, the word is closely associated with and maybe even equal to mahir (Hoch 1994: 136). Hoch translates mariyannu as "knight" and mahir as, "mil itary officier" (see Hoch 1994: n°175 and 190). But we can wonder whether this title, when used in the south ern Levant and Egypt, designated a real social class or was used to characterize high ranking military persons to which chariot warriors belonged. Some charioteers were also designated by the term kartappu, which appears in Hatti, Emar and in the Amarna Letters (Beal 1992: 152-162; Vita 1995: 124; Vita 2002: 126). For a good overview of mariyannu and their mentions in texts, see Beal 1992: 178-184; and for the Alalakh tablets see Dassow 2008. We even have a text, RS 16.239, quoting the title mariyannu sharri "royal mariyannu". In Ugarit, the king could grant someone the rank of mariyannu (see Reviv 1972: n. 42 and 41 for references). In Alalakh IV, entry into the mariyannu class was subject to regulation by the king himself (Dassow 2008: 282). Beal 1992: 182. Dassow 2008: 282. Schloen 2001: 214-215. Indeed, the designation as mariyannu refers more to a social group, a status or class than to a type of warrior or soldier (see Reviv 1972; Vita 1995: 93-109; Watson &amp; Wyatt 1999: 464-465). KTU 4.69. Schloen 2001: 215. Dassow 2008: 302. Dassow refutes Reviv's hypothesis that mariyannu in charge of chariots were of lower sta tus than the others. After a certain time, mariyannu could have outgrown their link with chariotry (Revtv 1972: 222; see also Lackenbacher 2002: 235-236, n. 802; Dassow 2008: 300-304). Watson &amp; Wyatt 1999: 465; see also Dassow 2008: 268-314. See for instance KTU 4.169. Heltzer 1982: 114; they were dependant upon the royal stores and workshop, and the palace also provid ed them with spears, chariots, and horses. For horses' food rations given by the palace and general adminis tration see Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche 2008. Dassow 2008: 300-314; and see for instance texts AIT 329, 330, 426, 428, 429. The text mentions "three horses and a chariot in the courtyard" as part of a list of precious objects appear ing several times in the text (Pardee 2000: 230; RS 2.

Feldman and Caroline Sauvage and Hatti62 as well as with Alashiya/Cyprus.63 The price of horses likely depended upon the horse's breed, age, size, etc.,64 which explains the variation from 70 to 200 shekels of silver.65 Horse sales were often high-quality deals that were delivered to the king or high officials of the kingdom. The price of the chariot itself is unknown in Ugarit, but Pardee estimates that it might have cost more than a horse,66 but we can also think that it was "priceless" if it could only be provided by the palace.67 Horses and chariots are mentioned only once in a legal document68 - a will - from 'Abdu mariyan nu of the King, who gives to one of his sons, Kalbu, his stables. While taking care of his stables, Kalbu will still have to refer to the authority of the over seer of the chariots. It is thus probable that these stables were royal ones, but it is also possible that in the meantime 'Abdu had the privilege of breeding horses for his own benefit;69 "II se peut done qu'un éleveur de chevaux ait été tenu de répondre aux demandes du responsable des chars du royaume; ä moins qu'il ne faille voir dans cette activité une fonction relevant du pouvoir royal".70 Other archaeological evidence Several examples of chariot-fitting objects have been excavated in Ugarit. A total of 35 chariot fit tings (yoke saddle bosses and/or finials) were found in the city. In the palace, two finials and three yoke saddle bosses were discovered by Schaeffer.''

One might expect more examples of the same kind (as for the stone anchors) before talking about votive offering, especially when texts mention the chariots and horses of the god. A large number of horses should have been available: in RS 16.142+, the king asks for 2000 horses for a breeder, showing that at least this many horses were available (Malbran-Labat &amp; Roche forthc.). For instance, Alalakh tablet 183 records 80 charioteers amongst a group of 1436 warriors and 76 charioteers out of another group of 1006 warriors.

As it is later attested in 2 Chronicles 1.16-17: Solomon imported horses from Egypt and sold them to the kings of the Hittites (probably referring to Neo-Hittite rulers at this date) and to the kings of the Arameans (Arnold 1905; Houlihan 1996: 36-37; 1 Kings 10: 28-29). Horses for war were also sometimes commandeered (Beal 1992: 134-137). A campaign against Assuwa provided 600 teams (Beal 1992: 146). In the Iliad (V: 268 sq), Anchises secretly bred horses. The epithet hippodamoi appears 24 times in the Iliad but could have a heroic value rather than being a ref erence to horse domestication and breeding (Pascale Brillet, personal communication). In time of war, the king of Kizzuwatna was required to supply military forces to Hatti and to provide 100 char iot teams (Beal 1992:146). Cilicia also provides horses to Solomon (I Kings 10.26) and to the Persians (Herodotus, Histories, 3.91). Togarmah in Tabal exported horses to Tyre (Ezekiel 26.14).

For instance, he records 820 riors serving the military forces of the Pharaoh horses and 730 chariots in his 7th year campaign generally came from a higher social level.173 They and 1,092 chariots in his 9th year campaign.166 A could have owned lands and were sometimes 162 There is no real evidence to connect the introduction of the chariot with the Hyksos invasion (Partridge 2002: 60), but it is certain that horses and chariots were introduced from Canaan sometimes in the 17th c. BC (see for instance Meeks 2005: 51-52). The chariot fittings found at Beth Shean indicate an introduction through Canaan (James 1978: 103), as does the Canaanite origin of the Egyptian words for horse "ssmt" (Cornelius 1994: 80; Donner 1955; the first attestation of this word appears in the inscription of Ahmes, son of Abana, and dates from Thutmose I, Meeks 2005: 52), stallion "ibf (Hoch 1994: 18-19: no. 3), and char iot "mrkbt/wrrt" (Hoch 1994: 145-147: no. 189), and also the Semitic origins for the names of chariots parts, equipment or drivers (Hoch 1994: nos. 9,15,109,145, 168, 173, 175, 190, 197, 306, 354, 361, 371, 506, 538), and the strong association of Levantine gods with hors es and chariots (see note 314). Moreover, two equine molars have been found at Tell el-Dabca, the capital of the Hyksos, along with a horse burial, suggesting that horses were present there at the beginning of the Hyk sos Period around 1640 BC (Houlihan 1996: 33; Von den Driesch &amp; Peters 2001: 310). In Egypt, the oldest skeleton of a stallion comes from the fortress of Buhen in upper Nubia, where it died in a fire and was dated by the excavators to the 13th Dynasty (1675 BC). Its dental remains could show evidence of bit wear (see Clutton-Brock 1974; Clutton-Brock 1992: 80-83. The evidence is not entirely convincing, see Raulwing &amp; Clutton-Brock 2009). However, the remains can not be dated (see Raulwing &amp; Clutton-Brock 2009) and it has been suggested that it was intrusive (see Houlihan 1996: 33). A skeleton was discovered in the Delta at Tell al-Kibir and was dated to 1750 BC (Houli han 1996: 33) and another one at Tell Heboua, in a big building, dating from the Hykos period-beginning of the New Kingdom (Chaix 2000). The first mention of a chariot is found on the stele of king Kamose, and it refers to Hyksos chariots. 163 Urk. IV, 663, 5-15; Breasted 1906: vol.

It was a strengthening of the heart to work with them, to learn their natures, to be skilled in training them and so enter in their ways" (Houlihan 1996: 35). It is also important to mention that specific places, "training stables," were devoted to horses and horse men training (see Faulkner 1953: 43, n. 11). 168 See below, part 3, and Decker (1987) 1993: 39-40. 169 Houlihan 1996: 34 170 Hyland 2003: 49; see also Starke 1995: 15-20. 171 See for instance, Faulkner 1953: 41-47.

Mycenaean Ceramics with Chariot Scenes By Caroline Sauvage Introduction: Overview of Vessel Forms and Scenes Chariot scenes were principally painted on amphoroid kraters (FS 53-55), but occasionally this motif also decorated open kraters with verti cal handles (FS 7-8), deep bowl kraters (FS 281-284), conical rhyta (FS 199), and flasks (FS 186) (Fig. 11). This special decorated pottery was principally and primarily found in Cyprus and then in the Near East, but growing evidence also comes from the Greek mainland, where it exhibits differences in find-spot contexts and ceramic shapes. Pictorial Mycenaean ceramics have been wide ly studied295 and their origins and distribution pat tern have been controversially interpreted. Despite the hypothesis that these ceramics were produced in Cyprus296 and then exported to the Near East - explaining their wide diffusion across the island and throughout the northern Levant - clay analysis suggests that they were instead pro duced in the Argolid,297 more precisely in Berbati298 but also near Tyrins,299 up to the end of the LH HIB. See for instance, Äkerström 1987; Balensi, Moncham bert &amp; Müller-Celka 2004; Betancourt, Karageorghis, Laffineur &amp; Niemeier 1999; Bradfer, Detournay &amp; Laffineur 2005; Courtois 1973; Crielaard, Stissi &amp; Wijngaarden 1999; Crouwel 1988; 1991; 2006a; Crouwel &amp; Morris 1985; Immerwahr 1993; Kara georghis 1958; Karageorghis 20000-01; Leonard 1994; Mountjoy 1986; Mou.NTfOY 1999; Müller-Celka 2005; Sakellarakis 1992; Steel 1999; Vagnetti 2000-01; Ver meule &amp; Karageorghis 1982; Wijngaarden 2002; Yon, Karageorghis &amp; Hirschfeld 2000. For previous hypotheses on a fabrication outside of the Aegean, see the references and bibliography in Furu mark 1941: 9, 431-445; Jones 1986: 597-601; Äkerström 1987: 16-17; Wijngaarden 2002: 9-11. Crouwel &amp; Mor ris, based on the early example of pictorial style found at Alalakh, estimated that it is difficult to think that "the majority of pictorial vases, including the earliest ones, all of which form part of the Aegean artistic tradition, were designed and manufactured in Cyprus rather than in Greece itself' (Crouwel &amp; Morris 1985: 98). Sherds of non-pictorial pottery whose paintings resem ble the pictorial sherds were analyzed: they were all produced in the northeast of the Peloponnesus Fig. 11 Chariot krater from Pyla-Verghi, Cyprus (after Vermeule &amp; Karageorghis 1982: fig. III.13; courtesy of Vassos Karageorghis) The representations on chariot kraters are pro cessional: the horses are walking at a slow pace and are generally seen in overlapping profile. Rep resentations of three ears,300 several legs or two tails on the visible front horse are the sole indica (Catling, Richard &amp; Blin-Stoyle 1963). For refer ences on fabrication in the Argolid, see for instance Catling &amp; Millet 1965: 221; Catling, Jones &amp; Millet 1978; Jones 1986: 603-609; Mommsen &amp; Maran 2000-01; Slenczka 1974: 152. 298 ÄKERSTRÖM 1987. Analysis conducted on the chariot krater from tomb 387 at Tell Dan shows that it origi nated from the Berbati/Mycenae area. 299 Mommsen &amp; Maran 2000-01: 103. Chemical studies tend to nuance this picture and to show that different production centers might have existed, especially at the end of the Late Bronze Age, with for instance a work shop located in Cyprus (Gunneweg et al. 1992). Analysis on material from Enkomi shows two different origins: Argolid and maybe Cyprus; the chariot krater ENK 52 might come from the Argolid, whereas, according to Gunneweg et al. (1992), the two chariot kraters ENK 42 and ENK 276 might have been locally produced. The recent evaluation of these sherds by Mommsen &amp; Maran also show that they are all chemically different from each other and belong to different productions of one or several workshops, but no definite provenance can be stated (Mommsen &amp; Maran 2000-01: 102). 300 See for instance RIH 73/1.</page><page sequence="30">96 Marian H. Feldman and Caroline Sauvage lion of the one behind. The crew of the chariot, as a rule, consists of two persons, the first a driver, the second one an official or high-ranking person sometimes shaded by a parasol attached to the box.301 On occasion we find crews of three302 or, more rarely, four303 persons.304 In some examples, there are men, grooms or even soldiers marching in front of the horses or following the chariot. In later specimens from the LH HIB, painters depict ed a woman in a gesture of grieving, which Aker ström interprets as a woman taking leave of a hus band departing for war.305 For Äkerström,306 the "orthodox" processional chariot scene on amphoroid or open kraters "more or less con trolled the market" and mostly remains the same in the LH HIB, even if this period tended towards geometrization or ornamentalization. Some chariot kraters show unusual motifs and decorations, such as the Pyla krater, the amphoroid krater in London (C341), and the "Zeus" krater from Enkomi.307 Likewise, one fragment from Tiryns308 depicts parts of two chariot teams driving to the right at high speed.

Likewise, a three-person crew is also attested by a frag mentary terracotta model from Tiryns (T 44). This model indicates a third occupant with the possible remains of a parasol beside him (Crouwel 1981: 65). 303 See for instance vases V 30 and V 58. (CROUWEL 1981). 304 Whereas Egyptian and Asiatic chariots mostly carry one to two persons, except on the relief of the battle of Kadesh and on the Battle of Ramses III against the Sea People, where the enemies are organized in three per son crews. 305 Äkerström 1987: 89. 306 Äkerström 1987: 116. 3°7 y|,¡s Crater is dated from the LH IIIB according to Äkerström 1987: 104, but from the LH IIIA:1 by Ver meule &amp; Karageorghis 1982. In these vases, a person is depicted carrying a geometrically shaped item on his shoulder while running toward the chariot. The object he is carrying has been interpreted as a bow (Vermeule &amp; Karageorghis 1982: 15); however, according to Äkerström, this object could be similar to an Egyptian low chair as depicted on Amenhotep Sise's tomb scene when he is returning from an expedition (ÄkerstrÖM 1987: 101-102). Äkerström 1987: 88, fig. 54.1; Schliemann 1885 (1967): 354, fig. 155; Vermeule &amp; Karageorghis 1982: XI.19. Karageorghis 1958.

Only a few vases have repre sentations of horse riders, such as MAN 76714, found in tomb VI at Minet el-Beida (Fig. 13). This type of representation is rare in the second millennium and horses were rarely ridden.314 In this study, we do not take all of the representa tions of horse riders into account, but only the ones that are or could be related to chariots. We thus take into account the Mycenaean ceramics especially when the representation appears on kraters or when the horse representation is deposited in the same context as other chariot- Fig. 13 Sherds showing horse rider from Minet el-Beida, related material. In such cases, we consider that tomb VI (MAN 76714; photo: C. Sauvage) they could have carried a similar meaning as a chariot representation. 1.

A few Fig. 13 Sherds showing horse rider from Minet el-Beida, tomb VI (MAN 76714; photo: C. Sauvage) 314 The first known representations of horse riders appear on terracotta plaques in Mesopotamia, such as BM 22958, and date from the first quarter of the second mil lennium BC (Moorey 1970: 37), even if there are textu al mentions of horse riders as early as the third millen nium BC in a Sumerian fable (Gordon 1958: 5.38). In Mari, horse riding was not considered safe, as in a Mari letter (ARM VI, 76), King Zimri-Lim is advised to take care of his personal safety by riding on a mule or in a chariot rather than a horse (Gordon 1958: 19 for fur ther references). Indeed, horses barely appear on royal seals and sealings: see however, the cylinder seal RS 92.3195 found near Urtenu's house (Yon &amp; Caubet 1995: 44, fig. 4). Except some military representations, most of the Late Bronze Age horse rider images are divine such as the gold leaf plaque from the Lachish temple dating from 1200 BC (Clamer 1980); in Egypt, the Levantine gods Reshep, Astarte and Baal-Seth are the only riding gods (and indicate the divine connec tion with war) and representations of Reshef on horses are only attested in the beginning of the 18th Dynasty, while horse rider representations are not frequent (see Leclant 1960; Zrai 1985; Cornelius 1994: 72-87). All the Egyptian sources associating the god Reshef with horses or chariots date from the 18th Dynasty and emphasize his warlike character when represented with weapons or mentioned in texts with Monthu, while the inscription describes the destruction of Egypt's enemies (Fulco 1976: 3-22 for the sources; Cornelius 1994: 87). The other Late Bronze Age representations of horse rid ers have a military context and show scouts and mes sengers armed with weapons, probably for their own safety, such as in the battle of Kadesh depicted at Abu Simbel or in the tomb of Horemheb at Saqqara (see Houlihan 1996: 33, 37 fig. 28). In Mycenaean Greece, horse riders were also part of the military expeditions and were either scouts or escorts and could also have had a ceremonial role (Bradfer-Burdet 2005: 91-92). According to Cultraro, riders may be young royal mem bers and symbolic of a particular gender and age grade (Cultraro 2005). In Egypt, only one inscription found in the tomb of Thutmose III mentions the possibility of the king riding on the back of horses (Houlihan 1996: 34). The real cavalry only appear in the first millennium BC as can be seen in Neo-Assyrian reliefs, and it is at the same time that horses became a royal mount (Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979: 134-139). This evolution of the func tion of horse riders is certainly due to the evolution of the rider's position on the equid, passing from a "don key seat" - as seen in Horemheb's tomb in Saqqara - to balanced seats as Sargon II's cavalrymen exemplified (Hyland 2003: 50-51; Littauer &amp; Crouwel 1979). According to Anthony, the rise of the cavalry in the first millennium BC was also due to the use of suitable, shorter bows ('cupid bows') that the archers were able to manipulate easily across the back of the horse (Anthony 2007: 223).

This krater was imported from the Argolid as analysis has shown. Moreover, it was painted by the same painter as a krater from Kourion (Mee 1982: 17, note 101 and 102). This krater was imported from the Argolid (Karantza li 2001: 36). Only one LH IIIB:2 chariot krater is known (Athens Museum no. 7387; Crouwel 1988: 34; Sakellarakis 1992: 25-26, cat n°ll). Pieces have been found at the Klakani and the Panagia ridges and another find from a chamber tomb at Palaiomandri (cf. Crouwel 1988: 34). Vermeule understood the chariot scenes as references to funerary processions and games or as a substitute for horse burials (Vermeule 1979: 61-62). Vermeule 1979: 60-61; Gallou 2005: 45. This dual horse burial gives the impression that the horses were yoked to a chariot, even if no trace of car or harness were found (Gallou 2005: 45, fig. 33a, 33b; Vermeule 1964: 298-299, pi. XLVIII.B). The entrance of the tomb was the passageway between life and death, therefore these burials might have an eschato logical connotation (Gallou 2005: 46). See also Immerwahr 1990: 153.

Summary The large number of chariot representations in New Kingdom Egypt highlights the central role they had assumed during this period in the deno tation of kingship and higher and lower elite sta tus. General consensus accepts that the light, two wheeled chariot was a relatively new technology in the Late Bronze Age, introduced into Egypt sometime during the middle of the second mil lennium.468 Its "youth" might be best recognized in the peripheral or non-existent participation of chariots in depictions of older traditions such as Fig. 32 Stele of Tjay, the charioteer the Opet festival in which the main transportation (after Davies 1903-1908: vol. 5, pi.

The Stage II chariot coincided with the four teenth and thirteenth centuries, and was the so called dual chariot. It was hardly ever represented in anything but a ceremonial setting.

The steatite seal was found out of context and tenta tively dated by the excavator to the early Iron Age. Fifteen seals, by far the largest number from any one site, have been excavated at Ras Shamra (one of which comes from the nearby port of Minet el-Beida) (Fig. 49a and b).558 They range fairly widely in their style of carving and the type of chariot scene depicted. At least three of them show animal hunting and battle imagery simulta neously, while another one might. Four others show only an animal hunt and one shows only a battle. Two of them might depict a parade or pro cession. Seven of them definitely include bows, while another two might; however, their imagery is difficult to read. In one case (Amiet no. 309, a hunt with bow scene), some kind of horned ani mal appears to be pulling the chariot rather than horses.

The reins appear to be wrapped around the charioteer's waist. Porada tentatively classifies it as Kassite, but notes "...no other such Kassite scenes are published."587 A related seal found at Choga Zanbil in south western Iran has been classified as Middle Elamite (Fig. 58).588 Said to be of porous faience, perhaps the so-called sintered quartz material popular in Elamite seals of this period, it depicts two figures in a chariot. One in front leans forward to draw his bow and arrow, while a smaller figure behind controls the reins. Birds appear to fly above, but no other sign of prey or human enemy exists. The seal is carved in a linear style and is decorated with hatched bands along the top and bottom. Amiet notes that the motif of a chariot is unique among Elamite seals, although the carving style and the decorated borders are found on numer ous other seals from Choga Zanbil.589 Summary Scenes of chariots are quite rare in the greater Mesopotamian area. When they do occur, they principally appear on seals. Middle Assyria may show a greater interest in the representational impact of chariots as seen on the marble lid and the White Obelisk, should it be dated to the sec ond millennium.

Aside from these two examples, the other chariot scenes belong to the realm of hunting without reference to battle (unless one includes the Nuzi impression 527 with tumbling figure), although such a reference may have been implied. The diversity of carving styles found among the glyptic, especially within the corpus of Nuzi impressions, is similar to that seen at Ras Shamra and suggests dispersed produc tion.

An Old Hittite period (seventeenth sixteenth century) sherd with relief decoration found in Temple I at Boghazköy-Hattusha pre serves part of a six-spoked wheel and cab of a chariot (Fig. 59).591 A quiver appears to be shown hanging from the cab. Such relief vases have gen erally been interpreted as having cultic associa tions, and the archaeological context in the main temple at the Hittite capital would seem to con firm this reading. Nonetheless, the chariot cab depicted on the sherd appears to represent that of a human entity. Chariots also appear rarely in Hittite visual arts as the conveyance for the Storm God as seen in a seal impression of Murshili III (Urhi-Teshub) from the thirteenth century also found at Boghazköy (Fig. 60).592 Here, however, the representation is distinctly not a copy of a "real" chariot, but rather one in the shape of an eagle drawn by bulls.

While the Hittites engaged in and were clearly successful in military activities, their rheto ric in terms of the royal figure was not one that emphasized the brutal side of conquest, as for example was the case in the later Assyrian Empire. Instead, the king tended to portray him self as a magnanimous victor who exercised his rule with compassion.595 For example, Murshili II claimed such compassion in his annals, saying, "I would certainly have marched against the disloyal vassal and destroyed him utterly, but he sent forth 594 A related use of the chariot in mythological scenes occurs on the Hasanlu gold bowl, which might date to either the end of the second millennium (1250-1000 BC) or the very beginning of the first millennium (1000-800 BC). On the bowl, three divine figures are depicted driving chariots drawn by bulls and equids. As a whole, the bowl has been linked to Hurrian mytho logical traditions.
