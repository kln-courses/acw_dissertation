Guillet. In this first full-scale an- thropological study of peasant participation in a Peruvian agrarian reform cooperative, Guillet shows that the agrarian reform law has been less than successful in its attempt to change landowner- ship patterns and to create new, participatory forms of land use. He argues that cooperative production is ill suited to Peru's peasant econ- omy. ISBN 0-8262-0263-2 February 192 pages $18.00 tent.
