<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS classification). It concentrates on aspects that would be of immediate practical use to anyone interested in natural resource use. There are striking similarities between the Samburu folk classification and Western scientific taxonomy on a number of points, the main one being the close correspondence between Samburu generics and scientific species. As far as I can tell, the Samburu classification and nomenclature are identical to those used by the Maasai of northern Tanzania, at least for all common species. Samburu commonly group the plants they distinguish into 'super-generics' in ways that again often resemble Western genus-level groupings. The Samburu distinguish specifics equivalent to Western ecotypes of individual species, but unlike their identification of generics, these distinctions are regionally variable. Following their discussion of folk taxonomy, the authors summarise types and extents of Samburu plant uses. Around 70 per cent of known plants are recorded as potential livestock forage; 40 per cent are used for medicinial purposes. Around 25 per cent are used for building purposes, a similar proportion for fuelwood and the same again as the source of plant parts that people eat. A more restricted subset (15 per cent) is used for ritual purposes and a similar proportion for making household goods. The concise summary of plant species preferred for each one of these uses, and of the properties that make individual species particularly suitable for particular purposes within any general category, conveys a great deal about Samburu environ- ment and ecology. The main part of the book then presents an exhaustive Samburu/ botanical plant dictionary which could be of use to any anthropologist, range scientist, or agricultural extension worker in East Africa generally but especially in Maa- speaking areas. It could also be of interest and use to the emerging generations of Kenyan students who are more familiar with schoolbooks than with field plant identification. My copy of the book does not indicate a price, but produced as camera-ready word-processed copy, bound in paperback, with a small number of line drawings, it is unlikely to be exorbitant. My only criticisms lie with the reference list and the acknowledgements. The reference list is very brief, omits some classical works on East African plants and their uses, and is almost too specific to Samburu ethnobotany. It omits at least one text reference, and I for one would have liked some pointers to similar work on other Maasai groups (besides the companion volume on II Chamus). My second criticism is that the line drawings are included apparently without acknowledgement. Some of the most skilful and attractive are direct copies of those made by Dr W. Eggeling and Mrs M. Church for the 1961 edition of Dale and Greenway's Kenya Trees and Shrubs. Their reproduction here omits only some of the detail, including the original artists' signatures.

The author is a specialist in interdisciplinary research in anthropology, especially in Central African art, oral literature and general ethnography. With more than twelve years of fieldwork in Zaire, and with extensive library, museum and archival research carried out in Europe and the United States, he is qualified to give a comprehensive and contextual view of Zairian sculpture. He is aware that such a study 'requires a 452</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS close understanding not only of its interrelationships with the other visual, verbal, musical, and kinetic arts but also of the technological, economic, sociopolitical, ritual and ideational frameworks within which the arts are produced and function' (1987: xiii). Volume 1 of The Arts of Zaire concerns southwestern Zaire, which is one of the most creative centres of African sculpture. The work is divided into three parts: 1) Documents; 2) Ethnography; and 3) Arts and cultures. In the first part the author presents the main sources and inventories, beginning at the end of the nineteenth century, using among others an abundant German literature. He discusses the different attempts to classify Zaire art and the various methods of interpretation. Biebuyck confesses: 'Because an artwork can and must be studied from many vantage points, it is vain to hope at this stage for complete coverage and understanding. In a region so culturally and artistically differentiated as Zaire, it is fair to state that the arts have barely been examined in their global dimensions' (1985: 47). In the ethnographic section, the author excluded for practical purposes the Kongo and the Teke from the cultural and artistic area defined as southwestern Zaire; both peoples form an integral part of this region, however, and are to be studied in a separate work. The third section is an excellent study of Zaire arts in their social and ritual contextualisation, and concerns thirty-four populations, its main chapters being on the peoples of the Middle and Upper Kwango-Kwilu Divide (Yaka, Nkanu, Suku and Holo) and the peoples of the Lutshima-Kwilu-Laonge and Middle Kasai Divide (Pende and Kwese). Biebuyck was forced to make his analysis of southwestern Zaire partly in museums which do not provide a proper cultural contextualisation of the artworks, but he has enough field experience to know the complexity of the context. The artworks appear in numerous physical settings, both temporary and permanent: dwellings, shrines located inside or outside villages or hamlets, treasure houses or houses of masks, villages, initiation lodges, rooftops, enclosures, graveyards and tombs, fields, trails, and crossroads. Many objects are worn or carried by a person, either continuously or intermittently. Numerous objects are hidden, to be seen or displayed publicly only on special occasions; others are permanently visible; some are probably never seen except by a few privileged persons. No museum exhibition could provide such complex conditions. The attempt to classify the art styles of this region raises many problems. F. M. Olbrechts was the first to clasify Zaire art styles (Plastiek van Kongo, 1946), but he acknowledged the vagueness of the boundaries and the existence of transitional groups and areas. Maesen found out that the regional and local styles into which Zaire sculptures can be classified do not always coincide with the geographical location of peoples; they do not necessarily comprise all groups inhabiting that area or all the artworks they produce (Encyclopedia of World Art: Bantu Cultures, 1960: 232). There are borrowings and many unexpected forms of synthesis: pairs of figurines used in certain eastern Kongo cults show one carved in Kongo style and another in Yaka; in the same ritual the Mfinu use figurines in Teke and Yaka styles; a Holo headman used Tsotso and Cokwe figurines in a cult he practised, while other ritual leaders possessed objects of Holo and Yaka origins (p. 216). From the ritual point of view, it must be said that witch-hunters execute their performances in neighbouring groups, some- times at great distances from their native land; because witches despise the unknown, they do not eat strangers who come from far away. Biebuyck insists on contextual interpretation and finds that, although the types of artworks are numerous and varied, the institutional and conceptual frameworks associated with them are well delineated. He emphasises that the contexts intersect and are cross-ethnically distributed. In any one of these frameworks several types of artworks with discrete or complementary functions and meanings may be used at different organisational levels (1985: 90). Having presented twenty-eight types of artwork from southwestern Zaire, the author finds that the geographical and cultural 453</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS distribution of these artworks is uneven. Some types are found in virtually the entire region; others have a local but transtribal distribution; still others are closely restricted to a particular subgroup. 'For heuristic purposes,' he says, 'the tribal universe must be used as a framework of reference.' A tribal style is not necessarily distributed uniformly within the tribal universe. Several styles may coexist within a tribal group; other styles overlap among territorially separated or mixed ethnic groupings. Furthermore, not all objects carved in a tribal area are made according to the group's own style, since objects introduced from elsewhere may have been locally imitated and perhaps modified (p. 97). A Zairian will agree with the author that the artworks reveal 'historical, economic, sociopolitical, legal, educational, mnemonic, ritual, ideographic, aesthetic, recreational, and psychological functions' (p. 91). As to the ritual functions, for instance, the dual anthropomorphic figurines may be symbols of one's dead, parents who protect their orphan child, and the Janus-type must keep away dangers coming 'from behind' and 'from before' a person (see Dictionnaire des rites, Vol. 13, Bandundu: Ceeba, p. 216). Volume 2 of Biebuyck's work, on eastern Zaire is based on the author's fieldwork (1949-58 and 1958-60). As in Volume 1, his approach is primarily contextual, though he also supplies morphological descriptions. The central subject of the study is Lega art, which is dealt with in six parts: on the Bwami Association and Lega art, anthropomorphic figurines, zoomorphic figurines, masks, other sculptures, and Bwami traditions. Biebuyck gives a detailed insight into the organisational aspects of the Bwami Association, the initiation rites, objects and sculptures, explaining song and dances. The texts are sung, murmured, whispered or tonally reproduced. He emphasises the Lega art in all its manifestations is bound so intimately with the Bwami Association that no valid interpretation is feasible without stressing the structural and organisational principles and the performance contexts of Bwami (1986:1). Sculptures are the privileged possessions of male and female members of the Bwami Association. Lega anthropomorphic figurines are striking in their stylisation and schematisation. They reveal very little about their signification. The author finds that the cryptic character of the form fits the mystery surrounding the uses of meanings of figurines in a closed initiation context (1986: 42). As to zoomorphic figurines a large range of animals interest the initiates: snails, frogs, lizards, varans (a type of lizard), crocodiles, antelopes, wild pigs, elephants, wild cats, chimpanzees and gorillas, birds, crabs and fish. A detailed study of the ritual will reveal the entire symbolism of the animal world, in the manner performed in the Dictionnaire des rites (12 volumes, Ceeba, 1984-89, Bandundu, Zaire) for southwestern Zaire. Lega masks are part of the hidden insignia belonging to individuals or groups, and are owned only by men. The wooden ivory maskettes represent not particular individuals but generalised human faces and are referred to as 'skulls'. The skulls of some initiates were preserved by their descendants in village shrines. When initiates display their maskettes in the rites, they view them as embodiments of their forebears. Masks and figurines are exclusive and secret objects. A non-initiate who touches them is guilty of transgressing a major proscription and will be considered as a sorcerer. The sculptures are kept hidden in shoulder bags and baskets and presented only in the context of certain rites. Volume 3 of The Arts of Central Africa is an annotated bibliography. The author presents abundant research resources in ten languages giving short appreciations from books, periodical articles, dissertations, exhibition and sale catalogues, and so on. The bibliography is divided into fourteen subjects, which are briefly introduced by the author. The first six paragraphs concern bibliographies, studies of the classification of languages, general ethnographies, travelogues, general studies on African art and general studies of Zairian art (pp. 1-108). In the eight chapters the author introduces the principal regions of Zaire. There are some 2,000 entries, but not all are annotated. 454</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS The study contains extensive indexes covering authors, titles, ethnic groups and media. Unfortunately, the bibliography ends with 1979, but we must be grateful to Biebuyck for this enormous work, which gives us an excellent insight into the literature on Zairian cultures. It is regrettable that there are no maps in volumes 1 and 2. But there are 199 well produced photographs, mostly unpublished pictures of Central Africa from Ter- vueren Museum. Biebuyck's tripartite study will be a standard work on the arts and cultures of Zaire, a splendid beginning to a new series of publications on non-Western arts.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (African Studies Series 57), 1987, xiii + 241 pp., ?27.50, ISBN 0 521 33533 7. These important books help to shift the focus of Zairian studies from concerns with the state to concerns with civil society. The Dialectics of Oppression in Zaire examines how ordinary folk perceive the Zairian state. Entrepreneurs and Parasites investigates a nascent entrepreneurial class and its relationship with the formal political sector. The heart of Schatzberg's excellent and lively work investigates the forms of state coercion and persuasion that most Zairians suffer, and some opportunities for resistance. The coercive activities of the political police are explored in Chapter 3, and those of the armed forces in Chapter 4. Turning from organisational to ideological concerns, which Schatzberg is at pains to integrate, in Chapter 5 he examines the President's persuasive political rhetoric. Paternal and familial metaphors are used in Mobutu's speeches to confuse political issues with familial ones. This at once legitimates state oppression as parental discipline, invests absolute power in the nation's 'father', and disrupts the administration of public policy by absolving its officials of responsibility. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with resistance to the state by the magistrature and certain religious groups. Although the independence of the magistrature continues to be eroded, their relatively high earnings, career stability and inherited European legal ideals have enabled them to resist this erosion, and resist the imposition of repressive laws. The age of Schatzberg's primary data is revealed here, and I fear that conditions in the mid-1970s when he did his fieldwork in Lisala do not match those today. In Chapter 7, religious institutions, specifically the Catholic Church and Kitawalists, are shown to offer a more coherent source of resistance to the state. Schatzberg locates these forms of coercion and resistance within what he terms a 'dialectics of oppression'. Conditions of personal, political and economic insecurity in state organisations has forced officials, not knowing what the morrow may bring, to expropriate hurriedly from contextual inferiors. The ensuing organisational rupture has so much accentuated economic decline that extortion is now a survival strategy for many. Insecurity within state hierarchies magnifies the insecurity of the citizenry. To find the economic and political space to make a living, ordinary folk are forced to seek security and protection in alternative institutions, such as the Church. These alternatives are competing foci of loyalty and political and economic organisation, and their quasi-autonomous existence is subversive because it challenges state control; 455</page></plain_text>
