Balancing Science The Portrayal of Environment in Due with tionship toward children emphasis to environmental awareness recent with are on the presented our trends Earth, of rela- and is- toward awareness of and emphasis on our rela- tionship with the Earth, children are presented with environmental is- sues at home, in school, and in the books that they read. Today's children will be the first to grow up with recy- cling bins in their kitchens, tips on television about being a "green" con- sumer, and books like The Berenstain Bears Don't Pollute (Anymore) on su- permarket shelves. The children of the 1990s are exposed to the notion of environmental awareness as children never were before ... or are they? If we look to the beginning of the 20th century, we find that there was an enormous appetite for knowledge of nature in American society. Nature study and gardens were introduced into the school curriculum; children and adults studied "the natural won- ders" as a hobby; and spirituality was seen by many to be rooted in nature. Hiking and camping were popular ac- tivities - promoted even for girls and women! Nature and animal stories helped to establish and spread this phenomenon. Beatrix Potter's The Tales of Peter Rabbit (1901-1911), Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894) and Just So Stories (1902), and Felix Salten's Bambi (1928) are but a few of the classics from that era. A look at the long-lived debate over children 's tradebooks. X S m g Cd E-1 C/2 Yet, as this movement grew, ani- mals were still widely viewed as mere resources to satisfy human desires. In fact, a huge controversy brewed over the portrayal of animals in lit- erature. This argument, labeled "the nature fakers controversy," critiqued the books of the early 1900s with last- ing effect. Revisiting the debate re- veals one approach to evaluating children's literature for appropriate use in the classroom today. Faking Nature The root of the nature fakers contro- versy lay between two men: William Long and John Burroughs. Burroughs strongly believed that an author should write scientifically ac- curate text in books about nature. Long, however, believed in allowing sentiment to prevail over scientific accuracy, and while he wrote many charming tales, his facts were dis- torted by "sentimental interpretation" and he described animals "not as they are but as humans so often like to think that they are" (Lutts, 1990, p. 172). At that time, anthropomorphic animal fables and tales told from the point of view of a wild animal were quite popular. Long and other authors infuriated scientists by labeling their animal tales as "nature books," while their detractors labeled them as mis- representative shams. Writers like Long and Ernest Thompson Seton knew much about the outdoors through direct experi- ence. But by prefacing his book Wild Animals I Have Known (1900) with, "These stories are true ..." followed by statements such as, ". . . and it must be remembered that though in 20 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN MARCH 1996</page><page sequence="2">Just as children did at the turn of the century, students today learn about the environment from their school curriculum and from reading books. Here, children work on a familiar modern-day science activity - a recycling project. and Sentiment: Nature and the Children's Literature By Susan Eggerton telling this story I freely translate from rabbit into English, I repeat nothing that they did not say," Seton brought on the attacks of Burroughs and others. These stories were ex- tremely popular, yet as this new genre emerged, the storm clouds gathered. As Burroughs so elo- quently argued (Lutts, 1990, p. 40), It is always an artist's privilege to heighten or deepen natural effects. He may paint us a more beautiful woman, or a more beautiful horse, or a more beautiful landscape, than we ever saw; we are not deceived even . though he out-do nature. We know where we stand and where he stands; we know that this is the power of art. But when he paints a portrait, or an actual scene, or event, we expect him to be true to the facts of the case. The Controversy Continues The nature fakers controversy of the early 1900s eventually subsided, but i s £ Cd É- cn MARCH 1996 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN 21</page><page sequence="3">the issues at its root remain and are still occasionally rekindled. In 1965, for example, Frances Clarke Sayers wrote a letter to the Los Angeles Times labeling Walt Disney a nature faker (Schickel, 1968, p. 350, as cited in Lutts, 1990, p. 239). In his 1990 book The Nature Fak- ers: Wildlife Science and Sentiment, Ralph Lutts specifies four problem ar- eas that modern authors of children's books should avoid: • the imposition of human values on wildlife, • the erroneous belief that humans can and should exercise control over nature, • the faulty notion that death has no place in nature, • and the portrayal of animals not as they are but as readers like to think that they are. Lutts feels, as do many others, that we should not foster distorted under- standings of the natural world; that we should not, for instance, view wild animals as behaving like the domesti- cated animals that we know, but rather as they are - animals living in an ecological environment that affects their behavior. The 1989 series Jane Goodall's Animal World is an excellent example of what Lutts feels is correct treat- ment, and what an interesting and inviting series it is! The format (small-sized for small hands), the brightly colored covers, and the en- ticing real-life photographs lead chil- dren to reach for the books. Yet, even today, as in the early 1900s, there are differences of opin- ion. In 1992, Chet Raymo wrote an interesting argument in The Horn Book Magazine article entitled "Dr. Seuss or Dr. Einstein: Children's Books and Scientific Imagination." Raymo's view is that "for the young child, the real world blurring with imagination is as it should be in order to foster a proper attitude toward sci- ence" (p. 560). His theory is that sci- ence depends upon sensitivity, a vora- cious curiosity, and a wonderful imagination even for things "too won- derful to be true" (p. 562). Raymo further argues that factual science books for young children ac- tually diminish the habits of mind that make good scientists! How a scien- tific mind is nurtured is a topic of research unto itself; but most would agree that it is important for informa- tion to be conveyed in a way that stimulates curiosity and enhances a child's feeling of wonder at the natu- ral world. Neither Dull Nor Painful I found many children's books that are scientific in nature but clearly contradict Raymo's theory that such books stifle curiosity or "swamp the boat of wonder." These books convey information in a manner that fosters sensitivity and curiosity. They are neither dull nor painful. One such book is Antler, Bear, Ca- noe: A Northwoods Alphabet Year by Betsy Bowen, published in 1991. Beautiful wood-block print illustra- tions entice the reader to learn about life in a little-known area of the United States. This alphabet book takes a cre- ative approach to a well-known for- mat and introduces a subject that is unfamiliar to most children. My experience in reading recent children's books made me aware of the importance of the teacher's judg- ment when it comes to choosing children's books for use in the class- room. Fortunately, an increasing number of books are available that can garner the approval of a discern- ing teacher interested in teaching children about the natural world with- out distortions or misconceptions. The Best for Education As the market for environmental books grows, publishers are releas- ing them in every format and on ev- ery level. Patti Sinclair, in her bibli- ography E is for Environment, categorizes books in a manner that balances young readers' developmen- tal characteristics with their need to understand and their desire for im- mediate action. Sinclair begins with the romantic, descriptive narratives such as Bambi, The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, and Owl Moon by Jane Yolen, for these books "plant the seeds of environmental awareness by eliciting emotional responses and fostering positive attitudes towards the natural world" (Sinclair, 1991, p. 1). Then she introduces the "web of life" books, which examine and aid in the understanding of the ecological interaction of all living things. The Animal Atlas by Barbara Taylor and Amazing Bird Facts by Anita Ganeri are excellent examples of books in this category. Next, Sinclair discusses "at issue" books, which relate to current events in ecology and provide important fac- tual information on given age levels. Examples are A Look Around Rain Forests by Ed Perez and The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry, two por- trayals of the fragility of the rain forest. In her bibliography, Sinclair makes the point that all of these books have their place in the educa- tion of children. It simply takes the expertise of a teacher to determine how best to use each type of book in the classroom. Publishers today are releasing children 's environmental books in every format and on every level 22 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN MARCH 1996</page><page sequence="4">Back to Nature The resurgence in the children's en- vironmental books market includes not only storybooks, beginning field guides, animal books, and nature craft/activity books, but also "activ- ism" books. The Earth Day 20th an- niversary publication of 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth by The Earth Works Group became an instant bestseller and prompted a frenzy of spin-off books packed with hands-on activities that relate envi- ronmental problems and solutions to everyday life. As more and more such books flood the market, we have begun to see a refining of the product. It is no longer good enough just to write about ecology, for although we can- not change what our ancestors did, we are responsible for what we do today. There is the argument that if publishers were acting out of the de- sire to save the Earth, they would not cut down so many trees to publish so many books on the subject (Lodge, 1992). But this is being addressed in the publishing industry, as we begin to see agreements being made to do- nate percentages of profits to replant- ing, as well as more environmentally sensitive uses of paper and ink. With the increasing availability of children's books on nature and the environment, critical assessments must be made in choosing books for classroom use. It must be remem- bered that for most people "environ- mental sensitivity springs from direct experiences with nature" (Estes, 1993, p. K3). A key element in such studies must be making a real-life connection. Field trips, hikes, and hands-on nature ac- tivities are the best sources for rein- forcement. We must try, in our every- day lives, to live up to the demands we are making on industry (and on book publishers). The formative years in a child's life are the early ones. To para- phrase John Burroughs, "The obser- vation of nature must be processed within the mind. Much like the hon- eybee making honey ... the nectar does not become honey until it passes through the chemistry of the bee's body" (Lutts, 1990, pp. 8-9). Since books play an important role in the education and development of most children, what better way is there to feed the nectar of environmental awareness?
