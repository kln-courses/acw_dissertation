<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Big History and the Size of God: Holistic Historicism  as a Pathway to Religious Naturalism Demian Wheeler / Union Theological Seminary I. Introduction: Historicism’s Ironic Avoidance of Nature A great irony abounds in much of the current literature on historicism. 1  As William Dean began to detect over two decades ago, a good major- ity of historicists, although placing an ontological and epistemological  premium on historicity, promulgates a historicism that ignores most of history,  the history of  nature. In particular, today’s historicist theologies, especially  those of the postmodern and postliberal variety, are so fixated on human his- tories—and, even more narrowly, on the socially, linguistically, and narrativally  constituted particularities of very localized religiocultural histories—that they  remain disconnected from, irrelevant to, and unconstrained by what we know  about the history of humanity as a whole and the broader history of the natural  world. Consequently, a lot of religious historicisms amount to a nonnatural- istic humanism or, worse, a “group subjectivism.”2 In what follows, I want to  take a cue from Dean and explore the ramifications of  incorporating all of   history—human and nonhuman—into a historicist worldview, probing, more  specifically, the serious theological implications of a “naturalistic-humanistic  historicism” or, as I prefer to dub it, a holistic historicism. II. Human History, Natural History, Big History:   Expanding Historicism’s Theoretical Gaze Before discussing what a holistic historicist theology might look like, I need  to first examine some of the theoretical contours of  what Dean refers to as  a “wider historicism,” a historicism that expands its gaze to include not only  social scientific testimonies about cultural history but also natural science’s  accounts of the history of nature. 1. The most concise account of the history of historicism is Sheila Greeve Davaney, His- toricism: The Once and Future Challenge for Theology (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2006). 2.

As the historicist and ecofeminist theologian  Sallie McFague evocatively writes: “All things living and all things not living  are the products of the same primal explosion and evolutionary history and  hence are interrelated in an internal way right from the beginning. We are cous- ins to the stars, to the rocks and oceans, and to all living creatures.”3 Indeed,  historicists hold that the historicity of Homo sapiens is distinctive, thanks to  the human acquisition of symbolic language, abstract reason, self-conscious  activity, and purposive agency, as well as humanity’s rootedness in diverse and  highly sophisticated and individuated cultures. “Without such historicocultural  shaping,” states the theological historicist Gordon Kaufman, “we would have  no form at all; we would not even be.”4 Still, human beings, he proceeds to  qualify, are “biohistorical” (or, better, socionatural) creatures. That is, we are  multiply located, constituted not only by the very specific cultural-linguistic  networks in which we develop but also by the larger natural histories (physical,  chemical, ecological, biological, etc.) from which we arose, by which we are  antedated, in which we are enfolded, and on which we continue to depend.5  Here, holistic historicists would second the sentiments of naturalists, such as  Donald Crosby: although “none is more astoundingly different from other  kinds of  organisms in its behavior, history, and accomplishments than the  human species,” Homo sapiens and all its complex, inimitable, and diversified  creations (including cultures and languages) are a part and product of nature.6  As a result, it is “not possible,” to quote Kaufman once more, “to understand  human existence apart from its wider situatedness in the ecology of life on this  planet,” which, in turn, “can only be understood within the context of the solar  system and the wider universe.”7 3.

Kaufman, In Face of Mystery: A Constructive Theology, 14. </page> <page sequence="3"> 228 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy  Furthermore, the natural world in which human history is wholly situated  must itself  be construed historically.8 A holistic historicist would point out that  many of the conditions of historicity (contextuality, change, finitude, perspec- tivity, contingency, spatiotemporality, and so on) are universal features of real- ity, obtaining not only in human history but also in the myriad natural histories  (biological, planetary, physical, cosmological) of which it is a part. According  to Dean, such a naturalistic-humanistic historicism replaces the “old dualism”  between the natural and the historical with a “new monism” that regards nature  as “one form of history.”9 The historicality of nature, Dean demonstrates, has  been substantiated by recent developments in quantum physics, particularly,  the research of John Wheeler. Employing the Copenhagen explanation of the  uncertainty principle, Wheeler, in Dean’s reading, hypothesizes “a participatory  universe” that is established not by “blind physical chance,” “predetermined  law,” or “subjective arbitrariness,” but by the interactions between the unfore- seeable, often chaotic, “interpretive” acts of present “observers” (“macrophysi- cal” and “microphysical”) and the limits imposed by things observed, which  themselves emerged out of still earlier “random or decisional” observations.  The regularities of  nature are “real temporary orders” that set boundaries  and restrict the range of possibilities, so much so “that there are scientific laws  that do accurately generalize about the past and do have enormous predictive  worth.” But those laws, too, are “historically contingent,” not “eternal” or “in- dependent,” emerging and passing out of existence at precise moments of time  and being temporally shaped by each observational occurrence. So, for Wheeler,  natural reality—its particularities and even its nomothetic constancies—is  neither entirely given nor “whatever we subjectively make it,” but historical. It  is “a slowly changing and indeterminate” chain of relations, “literally created  by a historical series of observer-observed, relational events, a series that could  have taken a different course at innumerable junctures.”10 Whether in culture  or in nature, interpreting subjects participate in and alter what precedes them,  as when preexisting photons in the delayed-choice experiment “become” either  waves or particles depending on the apparatus used to register them.11 8.

If  naturally selected, mutations (some of which  are adapted “in response to environmental pressures and are heritable”) enter  history “as a living tradition” and alter “the present and future order” of a lo- cal environment, which, in turn, affects the evolutionary potentialities of the  entities it subsequently environs. Thus, nonhuman nature, like culture, is the  product, not of “foreordained structures,” but of historical “conventions,” of  “a sequence of prevailing social agreements” between the spontaneous (i.e.,  unpredictable) variations of life forms and the lifeworlds that house and some- times select them.13  Fellow historicist Sheila Greeve Davaney supports the effort to formulate  a “historicized naturalism” but suspects that describing the natural world as  a “chain of interpretations” (or conventions) anthropomorphizes nature and,  ironically, reinscribes the very linguisticism Dean desires to overcome. It is  very important to keep in mind that Dean is using the category of interpre- tation loosely, referring, as Davaney herself  concedes, “not to the conscious  elucidation of meaning” (which would restrict interpretive activity to human  history), “but to creative and transformative engagement” with the environ- ment (which takes place in every sphere of reality, including unconscious and  nonhuman ones).14 Regardless, Davaney’s charge, in my judgment, has some  validity, which is why I would add one further (and perhaps more promising)  source for theorizing a holistic historicism: the burgeoning interdisciplinary  field of study colloquially known as “big history.”  Leading “big historians,” like David Christian, begin by contending that  every single thing in nature—e.g., human societies, plant and animal species,  atoms, stars—has a history, arising at a precise spatiotemporal juncture, chang- ing over time, and eventually perishing. Put differently, in the post-Darwinian  era, all the objects, entities, and phenomena of our natural world, along with  the natural sciences that investigate them, have been thoroughly historicized.  Paleontologists, geologists, astronomers, biologists, and physicists now realize  that they are, as it were, historians, “in the tricky business of  constructing a  12.

What big history does is  analyze the past (and the present and future) across multiple disciplines (e.g.,  astrophysics, biology, anthropology, etc.) and at different and ever-widening  spatiotemporal scales (up to and including the Big Bang). The result is nothing  less than a history of everything, a revisable but scientifically based “modern  creation myth” that uses the best empirical evidence and methods available to  elegantly and artfully weave the whole of  human and natural history into a  coherent, unified history.16  The historical narrative composed by Christian and others spans enor- mous durations and sacrifices some detail in order to bring reality’s general  trends, slower changes, bigger objects, and new levels of  complexity into  focus. Admittedly, such grand, universalist ambitions may, on the surface at  least, appear to undermine historicism. However, I would propose that just  the opposite is the case: big history does not deny historicity, but extends it.  That is, big historians show how the constituents of  history, while unique and  particular, are conditioned, elicited, and illuminated not only by the specifici- ties of  a local environment but also by the larger contexts, structures, and  patterns in which they are nested. To illustrate, the manifold cultural histories  of  the last few millennia cannot be fully understood without mapping the  global history of humanity, from its acquirement of  “collective learning” in  the Paleolithic era, to its development of  “tribute-taking states” and agrarian  and urban civilizations, which cannot be fully understood without track- ing the evolutionary history of  the species, earlier hominines, multicellular  organisms, eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and the biosphere, which cannot be  fully understood without comprehending the planetary history of  the earth’s  origins and formation, which cannot be fully understood without considering  the cosmic history of  the solar system, the elements, the stars, the forces of  gravity and electromagnetism, and the universe itself. Hence, big history is, in  effect, a big historicism: no part of  history can be fully understood without  understanding all the prior and broader histories that make it historically  possible and contextually intelligible. 15.

Beyond Supernaturalism and Supranaturalism:   Negative Theological Corollaries of a Holistic Historicism With a few theoretical building blocks now in place, I want to move on to the  driving question of this essay: what alterations would historically conscious  theologies need to make, critically and constructively, if  their historicism be- comes holistic, if  they test their claims against specific religiocultural histories  and big history, history in all its human and natural vastness?  First, on the negative level, giving the “historical data” of natural history  “veto” power and appraising theological ideas “before the bar” of  contem- porary “scientific opinion” ought to give theologians serious pause as to the  continued usefulness of  supernaturalism—that is, the belief  in transcendent  wielders of causation; miracles; eternal souls; postmortem afterlives and states  of awareness; or entities, spirits, deities, or realms above, beyond, or outside of  nature.17 Instead, a holistic historicism would engender a thoroughly naturalistic  outlook, since, as Owen Flanagan stipulates, supernatural powers, domains,  and causes “cannot be seen, discovered, or inferred by way of any known and  reliable epistemic methods.” By Flanagan’s reckoning, “for all we know and can  know, what there is, and all there is, is the natural world.”18  Dean asserts that narrative and postliberal theologians, in contrast, have  lost the ability to discard supernaturalism precisely because their historicism is  truncated, monohumanistic, and nonnaturalistic. Postliberal historicists, such  as George Lindbeck, allege that social/religious identities are not only defined  but, in a sense, also confined by highly particularized cultural-linguistic systems;  they remain “incommensurable” with alternate frameworks of meaning and  essentially unaffected by their complex interactions with other cultures (not to  mention the larger natural environments in which they are enclosed).19 Thus,  postliberals end up with subjectivistic and confessionalistic (or “intrasystem- atic”) theologies that are insulated from external scrutiny and are gauged only  17.

Lindbeck’s reply to this sort of incredulity typifies the  arbitrariness, traditionalism, relativism, irrationalism, and fideism that often  accompany culture- and language-centered historicisms: “The sense of what  is real or unreal is in large part socially constructed, and what seems credible  or incredible to contemporary theologians is likely to be more the product of  their milieu and intellectual conditioning than of their science, philosophy, or  theological argumentation.”20 Dean’s naturalistic-humanistic historicism, on  the contrary, backs postliberalism’s postmodern denial of  foundationalism  and objectivism, but without undoing the gains of modern theology (including  the denunciation of the supernatural) or neglecting the natural sciences or the  natural world beyond our own religiohuman histories. If  postliberal human- istic historicists, overstating Thomas Kuhn’s perspective, reduce scientific facts  about nature to just another “rhetorical gesture” and even permit the scriptural  universe to “absorb” the actual universe,21 then unapologetically liberal holistic  historicists, like Dean, allow modern science’s (admittedly paradigm-laden and  historicized but observational and experiential) knowledge of natural history  to put restrictions on what counts as theologically admissible and, when neces- sary, to override outmoded views (e.g. premodern supernaturalism).22  That a naturalistic historicism undercuts supernaturalism is obvious to the  point of  being banal. However, I would additionally suggest that historicist  theologies serious about the whole of history ought to place considerable con- ceptual constraints even on what Paul Tillich called “supranaturalism,” which  “separates God as a being, the highest being, from all other beings, alongside  and above which he has his existence.”23 The antisupranaturalistic repercussions  of a holistic historicism can be illustrated by comparing it with yet another  historicist theology: liberation theology, and more particularly, the black libera- tion theology of James Cone. Similar to postliberals, Cone and liberationists  in general perpetuate a narrower historicism, making it difficult for them to  20. Ibid., 62–63. 21. Ibid., 117. 22.

IV. The People’s History and Personal God   of Liberation Theology: A Case Study in the Limits   of a Truncated, Nonnaturalistic Historicism Liberation theologians articulate the central historicist insight with unparal- leled clarity and conviction: there is no such thing as disinterested, atemporal,  ideology-free, universal, or nonpartisan—ahistorical—language or thought.  Cone’s historical consciousness is especially sophisticated and thoroughgo- ing, maintaining that people are always contextually located, ideologically  driven, and limited and conditioned by the political, socioeconomic, material,  and cultural circumstances in which they are situated. Comprised of “human  speech about God,” theology, too, is inherently “subjective,” “informed by  historical and theological traditions” and mediated by the lived experiences  of “a particular people in a definite social setting.”24  Despite that, Cone’s historicism, akin to postliberalism’s, is grounded in a  kind of  neo-Barthianism and tends to be truncated, nonnaturalistic, ultra- particularistic, and even confessionalistic, thereby exhibiting the same sorts  of  proclivities for insularity, identity protection, parochialism, and special  pleading.25 African American liberation theology, he confesses, is unabash- edly anthropocentric and, more specifically, centered on concrete, oppressed,  black humanity; it is, therefore, sourced, funded, and normed by, and “ac- countable only to,” the biblical witness to God’s self-revelation in Jesus as it is  expressed in the particular experiences, history, culture, and church traditions  of  the black community and its ongoing quest for justice in a racist society.26  Undoubtedly, the liberationist stress on particularity, and even separation,  was absolutely necessary for emphasizing the sociohistorical locatedness of  human life; for cultivating self-determination, consciousness-raising, and  communal empowerment; for denouncing white supremacy; for exposing the  male and Euro-American prejudices of prevailing theological systems; and for  24.

At the same time, though, Cone’s  appropriate but myopic attentiveness to a “people’s history,” so to speak, has  led him to overlook other histories (human and nonhuman), to succumb to  a “hermetic fideism,”27 to divorce the “problem of the nonperson” (the fight  against injustice) from the “problem of the unbeliever” (the question of reli- gion’s truth in a scientific era),28 and, in the process, to unwittingly surrender  many of  the modern theological tools by which he could lighten some of  liberation theology’s doctrinal baggage—the heaviest of  which (as even he  senses29) is its theodicy-riddled, supranaturalistic faith in a divine being who  opts for human underdogs.  Supranaturalists, according to Wesley Wildman, promulgate “an anthropo- morphic and idolatrous metaphysics of God as a determinate entity,” who, in  Tillich’s words, “governs [the universe] according to a plan, directs it toward an  end, [and] interferes with its ordinary processes in order to overcome resistance  and to fulfill his purpose.”30 God the liberator is a supranatural deity insofar  as s/he is a divine agent who exercises a “preferential option” for the least and  the last and is personally at work in history striving to procure the liberation  of the poor. Again, Cone exemplifies the liberationist theological standpoint  nicely, declaring that God is “decidedly involved” in human affairs and, even  more, unambiguously partisan, electing the “unwanted of society . . . against  oppressors.” So, “God is black,” a symbolic affirmation that, nonetheless, refers  to something unequivocally true, namely, that the liberation of the oppressed  is the essence of divine revelation, activity, and providence and the “innermost  nature” of God.31 Surely, this is a supranatural God in Wildman’s sense of the  term, a “personal, benevolent, attentive, and active deity” who has “awareness,”  “intentions,” and “powers to act.”32 As the Brazilian feminist Ivone Gebara  perceptively notices, the liberationist God is “one more variation” of classical  personal theism. “He” is none other than the God of “the Western patriarchal  Christian tradition” presented with “a liberator’s face”—an “omnipotent” and  27. Such is Cornel West’s allegation against Cone. West still credits Cone (along with Mary  Daly and Gustavo Gutiérrez) for “discovering history,” his “Barthian Christocentrism”  notwithstanding.

Because “the  reduction of transcendence to a personal being” is idolatrous, and because the  ostensible recipients of divine preference continue to endure “the nonsense of  an existence reduced to survival.”34 Gebara is critiquing anthropomorphism and,  even more powerfully, evoking the pall of theodicy that is cast over liberationist  theological perspectives (and determinate-entity theisms generally), the contra- diction between the doctrine of a providential, all-good liberator, whose will is  to end the affliction of the downtrodden, and the dearth of concrete historical  instances of human liberation.35 My claim here is that when liberation theol- ogy is viewed against the historical backdrop of nature as well, we can perceive  its already palpable anthropomorphism and theodicy issues writ large, very  large. To pick up on an argument Wildman recently made, it is really hard to  square a personal, intentional, loving creator—much less a divine liberator  who favors the weak—with evolution, which involves so much “predation”  and “mindless chance,” so many “random symbiotic collaborations,” “tragic  species extinctions,” and “pointless cruelties.”36 In a remarkable new article,  Andrew Irvine echoes Wildman’s sentiments and applies them directly to the  God of liberation theology. Unlike other scholars writing about the future of  liberation theology, Irvine refuses to skirt matters of truth, adamant that “the  God who opts for the poor” must be argued for rather than assumed. And,  he contends, the “cultural physics” of late modernity, including evolutionary  explanations of natural history, do indeed severely militate against a “meta- physics that insists there is a divine person who intervenes in the world so as to  advance the cause of the oppressed in relation to others.”37 In my estimation,  33.

As David Christian ominously foretells, “the second law  of thermodynamics will assert its bleak authority more and more effectively,”  and the cosmos “will get simpler, colder and lonelier,” leaving behind a “co- lossal galactic graveyard” and, later, a depressing “sprinkling of photons and  subatomic particles.”41 In short, from a big-history, holistic historicist viewpoint,  personal, beneficent, supranatural gods seem too anthropocentric, congenial,  spatiotemporally and metaphysically limited, and empirically unfounded to  serve as viable interpretations of ultimate reality, despite their pervasiveness  and potency in theistic perspectives,42 such as Christian liberation theology.  To be very clear, I am not suggesting that liberationists stop doing theol- ogy from the margins of history and for the purposes of overcoming distinct  forms of oppression; such is its brilliance. I simply want to imagine, by way of  example, what would happen if  more narrowly focused historicists (in this case,  liberation theologians) widened their historicism and consulted nature—and  not just to develop ecotheologies (as vital as that is) but also to critically scruti- nize the religious experiences and beliefs of the groups they represent against the  larger vistas of reality, which include the truths that the sciences divulge about  the intricate (and often brutal) workings of the natural world. And it has been  my contention that the bigger liberationism’s historical perspective gets, the  more its strain of supranaturalism would have to be empirically problematized  and theologically revised.

Much more must theologians who af- firm God has an exceptional concern for the victims of humanity’s inhumanity  reflect that the flourishing of all kinds of life evidently depends upon processes  that also waste and destroy life.”43  In contrast, since Cone’s historicism is so truncated, based solely on “scripture  and the black Christian experience,” his only recourse for proclaiming a divine  liberator in face of the four-hundred-year history of African American suffering  (to say nothing of the vastness and violence of the cosmos’s fourteen-billion-year  history) is confessional: “Jesus Christ is the essence of . . . liberation. Thus he is  the decisive historical event beyond which no one needs to appeal.”44  All that being said, a critical disclaimer is in order: holistic historicism renders  anthropomorphic doctrines of the divine inadequate only if they are deemed  literal depictions of God’s metaphysical character and empirical activity in the  universe. In other words, a historicist theology that assimilates the breadth of  human and natural history requires us, not to throw away God the liberator  and equivalent determinate-entity deities, but to relativize them, assign them a  demythologized ontological status, and reinterpret them as socially constructed  and partially valid human symbols. There is no reason why personalistic God- constructs, like the divine champion of the vulnerable, could not, for instance,  be retained as what Dean, in another connection, terms “sacred conventions.” A  sacred convention is a concrete embodiment of a society’s deepest longings and  ultimate concerns, which, nonetheless, eventually “takes on a life of its own”  and acts back upon the heritage that produced it.45 Irvine’s Nevillian approach  is also consistent with a holistic historicism. Irvine portrays the liberationist  God as a “complexly conditioned” but “truthful” symbolic engagement with  ultimacy, which “breaks” against “the inscrutable ground of being” yet brings  about a “liberating transformation of the symbol users” and their contexts. So,  as a description of an extant being’s doings in the world, God’s preferential  option “almost certainly cannot be right,” but as a “conventional sign” that  “proximally” symbolizes the community’s own somehow divinely energized  “opting for the poor,” it “may yet ring true.”46 43.

For one thing, theologi- cal conventions, as Dean urges, are not supernatural essences or supranatural  beings, but neither are they unreal fads of human whimsy; rather, they are as  solidly real “as any historical reality can be,” beginning as “fictions” but, sooner  or later, transcending their human makers and developing into autonomous,  living traditions that behave unpredictably, have effects, and even instill awe.48  But beyond even this, a holistic historicism, I propose, also makes room for  a naturalistic metaphysics of religious ultimacy, signaling, albeit dimly, that to  which our anthropomorphic mythologies and God-metaphors fallibly respond  and even “distally” refer,49 what Irvine calls the indeterminate “ground,”50 what  Dean calls “mystery,”51 or what I shall call the sacredness of, within, or beneath  history’s mysterious and ambiguous wholeness. V. Apophatic, Pluralistic Naturalism:   A Metaphysical and Religious Ultimacy   Model Befitting of a Holistic Historicism Which brings me to the second—and constructive—theological implication of  a holistic historicism. A wider historicist theology does more than just supply  a mallet for smashing supernaturalism and tenderizing supranaturalism so  that it is easier to chew in the late modern age; it also breaks open a positive  theological space for hypothesizing spiritually robust, even mystically inclined,  versions of  religious naturalism. And the naturalistic ultimacy model most  befitting of a holistic historicism is, I submit, some inflection of what might  be labeled apophatic, pluralistic naturalism.  Akin to all religious naturalisms, apophatic, pluralistic naturalism is anti- supernaturalistic and antisupranaturalistic but is, at the same time, confident  47. See Gordon D.

On the one hand, to describe it as apophatic is to vigorously set it apart from  scientistic, value-allergic, spiritually dead materialisms and to gesture toward  the religiously penetrating and epistemologically impenetrable, the aesthetically  overwhelming and axiologically overflowing mystery at the depths of history.53  The qualifier pluralistic, on the other hand, distances it from religious natural- isms that arbitrarily identify the sacred solely with the “good” (or liberative)  elements of nature,54 signifying that ultimate reality (or God) pertains to his- tory in its ambiguous totality.55 To expound, I want to very briefly mention  five religious naturalists—Gordon Kaufman, William Dean, Wesley Wild- man, Donald Crosby, and Bernard Loomer—whose positions differ from one  another in several important respects, but who all epitomize the deliberately  generic and capacious theo-logic of apophatic, pluralistic naturalism.  Kaufman is a holistic historicist par excellence, anthropologically (see sec- tion II, above) and theologically. The traditional anthropomorphic image of  a supernatural, “person-like” divine creator is, for Kaufman, too small for a  big history. In its stead, he puts forward a naturalistic and scientifically cogent  theology in which “creativity itself” is the referent for the symbol “God.” Cre- ativity is displayed throughout the whole cosmos and its varied and changing  “historical trajectories,” from the inexplicable appearance of the universe in  the Big Bang (creativity1); through the gradual unfolding of cosmic and earthly  evolution and the emergence of increasingly complex systems and life forms  (creativity2); to the “directional movement” that led to language-using, self- conscious human beings and the spectacular array of social and imaginative  worlds created by them (creativity3). Creativity—“the coming into being of the  new,” the eventuation of animals “with great symbolic facility,” the sheer enigma  of why there is something rather than nothing—is, as negative theologians have  52.

See, for example, Henry Nelson Wieman, The Source of Human Good (Atlanta: Scholars  Press, 1995). 55. My usage of pluralistic naturalism is a modification of Dean’s “historicist pantheism”  (which itself  modifies what William James and, more recently, Nancy Frankenberry desig- nated “pluralistic pantheism”), and I employ it to convey roughly the same idea: “ultimate  meanings refer to everything in history,” even “history’s evils.” Dean, The Religious Critic  in American Culture, 70, 83. </page> <page sequence="15"> 240 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy sensed for eons, a profound and unknowable mystery, thereby functioning as  “the ultimate point of reference” that “relativizes” everything finite (including  our God-constructs). And it is deeply ambiguous, too, generating a nature “red  in tooth and claw.”56 Wildman suspects that Kaufman’s accent on serendipitous  creativity may too easily distance “God from the nasty events that destroy  harmony and peace.”57 But Kaufman is careful not to confuse the novel with  the (human) good, since the same creativity that begot organisms capable of  nonviolence “often brings forth new realities through massive violent destruc- tion” (e.g., volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, black holes).58  Dean, whose own historicist thought is firmly rooted in the religious natural- ism and empiricism associated with the early American pragmatists and the  Chicago school of theology, unsurprisingly praises Kaufman’s steady move- ment away from “a neo-Kantian subjectivism” and toward “a more naturalistic  historicism.” Convinced that the “historical emergence” of  “unpredictable  novelties” and “the tropism toward greater complexity” are, in fact, theologi- cally suggestive, Dean finds particular affinity with the Kaufmanian notion that  God is the “hidden creativity” working itself  out in the evolutionary processes  of nature and culture.59 But Dean has been even more dogged than Kaufman  (and most theologians) about the thoroughgoing ambiguity of the divine. He  blasts other religious naturalists for hedging about the sacred’s complicity in  evil, for clinging to an omnibenevolent God far removed from “the dark side”  of life. Such a God, as Dean very recently reiterated, is fundamentally ahistori- cal, because “social and natural history evince nothing that is perfectly good ...  In history ... every ‘good’ is contextual and perspectival, so that, for example,  what is good for a blood-sucking mosquito is bad for its victims.”60 A holistic  historicist God, then, is a pluralistic God, a God implicated in, tainted by, and  related to everything in history, even its atrocities and tragedies.61 Additionally,  it is a God that is utterly mysterious.

Mystery is  not something “antinatural” or “nonhistorical,” Dean assures, but is the uni- verse’s “more” (James), which is adumbrated by accepting the limits of secular  history and the sacred conventions that rise and perish within it.62  Fusing Tillich’s ground-of-being theology, Neville’s antisupranaturalist meta- physics, and Corrington’s ecstatic naturalism, Wildman pictures the ultimate, not  as a personal being, but as the “self-transcendent ground” of natural reality in  all its complexity, intensity, mystery, and incalculable density of meaning. The  apophatic mystics inhabiting the “undersides” of every religion are essentially  correct, in Wildman’s judgment: ultimacy is, in itself, “empty of determinacy”  and, hence, finally ineffable and incomprehensible. For that reason, if literalized,  the anthropomorphic gods humans create to make sense of their lives and “to  legitimate the exercise of social control” quickly become idolatrous distortions.  After all, they are not themselves ultimate; rather, ultimacy is the “cognitively  all-surpassing,” “imponderably beautiful,” and ecstatically registered power  source which “hovers behind and beneath and beyond” them and in which they  symbolically, brokenly, participate. Furthermore, as “the most basic ontological  condition” (i.e., the ground) of reality, whatever determinate features ultimacy  does have emerge in relation to “its expression in the valuational depth structures”  of nature; thus, anything which is known about the divine character is acquired  not via supernatural revelation, but through “multidisciplinary comparative in- quiry”63 into what this world reveals to human experience in the “primal spring”  of its axiological flows and possibilities. And the axiological flows and possibili- ties that nature actually discloses are fecund and emergently ordered as well as  fickle, chaotic, fierce, death-dealing, and totally ambiguous, leaving little, if any,  empirical basis for attributing anthropocentric design, providence, intentionality,  personality, and perfect goodness to ultimacy. When we curtail our “reality- evading biases toward the pleasant” and consider the natural world as a whole,  what is glimpsed is something quite wild, but not very manlike: the simultane- ously awe-full and awful ambiguities, the morally “terrifying” and “untamable”  value-potentialities, that are encountered at the depths of nature. Ultimate reality  is, for Wildman, at once “supportive of and hostile toward” our bodily, rational,  cultural, and spiritual endeavors, the “partially intelligible ground” of being  62.

That is, nature, regarded as bereft of deities, consciousness, personal- ity, design, purpose, or “animating spirits of any kind,” (1) comprises the only  reality there is or ever will be, requiring “no explanation ... beyond itself” to  account for its existence, and (2) contains enough sublimity, grace, and splendor  to deserve the same sort of reverence and devotion typically reserved for God.  In brief, there is nothing above, behind, or outside the dynamic, everlasting  matrix that is nature and, consequently, no object more suitable for the ulti- mate concerns and commitments of human beings, who are themselves natural  creatures without remainder and whose origins, responsibilities, and destiny  “lie here and not in some transcendent realm.”66 In that sense, Crosby’s “reli- gion of nature” is atheistic. But it is certainly not the positivistic, axiologically  thin, “flattened-out” atheism that Wildman thrashes.67 Crosby fallibilizes sci- ence, gives the arts, the humanities, metaphysics, and everyday experience their  epistemological due, and paints an ontologically multifarious nature pregnant  not only with raw facts but also with aesthetic qualities, felt penumbra, values,  and numinous depth. Most significantly, among the myriad features that make  nature a legitimate candidate for religious faith and loyalty is its hiddenness, the  inexplicability of its “sheer givenness” and “creative ongoingness.” Nature is  “the secret wellspring of all that is,” the stupefying “fringe of mystery” before  which we stand in “reverential silence.”68 In addition, if  Crosby’s naturalism is  not reductive, apophatically tone-deaf scientism, neither is it nature romanti- cism.

More to  the point, “reality and ambiguity go necessarily together,” as “good” and “evil”  are often interdependent and always perspectival.69  Loomer, finally, might be christened the grandfather of apophatic, pluralis- tic naturalism. A self-avowed naturalist and empirical process theologian, he  claimed that the “one,” “experienceable,” “interconnected” world of natural  relations and events is the only reality to which we have access. God, it fol- lows, must “be identified either with a part or with the totality of the concrete,  actual world, including its possibilities.” The mature Loomer chose the latter  option, the pantheistic option: the divine is not an “enduring ... individual with  a sustained subjective life,” but is none other than “the organic restlessness of  the whole body of creation.” And if  the “world is God,” then God, reasoned  Loomer, has to embody all the aesthetic contrast, imperfection, and ambiguity  actually found therein: creativity and destructiveness, order and disorder, unity  and discord. An “unambiguous” deity, a deity defined by pure love and good- ness or restricted to the process of “creative transformation” (Wieman), is too  clean and perfect to be concretely real; it is a bloodless, unempirical abstraction  from a cosmos that is inescapably ambiguous. A God whose “stature” or “size”  embraces nothing less than nature in its concrete empirical wholeness must  express “an expansive urge toward greater good” and “a passion for greater  evil.” What is more, Loomer, like the other religious naturalists analyzed above,  had an apophatic streak. “God,” he effused, is a symbol for the “holy ground”  that is the natural “world in all the dimensions of its being,” a world whose  “depths and immediacies” and “inexhaustible meaning” contain yet enshroud  “the ultimate mystery inherent within existence itself.”70  To clarify, I do not wish—at least in the present article—to endorse any  of these variants. Instead, I have simply attempted to specify what a holistic  historicist theological metaphysics would minimally require, namely, an apo- phatic, pluralistic naturalism. This model is intended to be as vague as possible,  boasting enough latitude to include a plethora of alternatives, from a creativity  theology (Kaufman and Dean), to a ground-of-being naturalism (Wildman),  to an atheistic religion of nature (Crosby), to a process pantheism (Loomer).  For my purposes here, whether a holistic historicist views ultimate reality as  the creative mystery within or the abysmal ground beneath the natural world,  69.

VI. Toward a (Naturalistic) Humanistic Historicism   and a Broader Conventionalism: A Final Plea So, to come full circle, where does apophatic, pluralistic naturalism leave the  existing religions and their anthropomorphic, personalistic deities?  For starters, expanding “the size of God” to encompass the whole of his- tory enhances rather than diminishes the import of determinate-entity theisms.  Undeniably, a mysterious and ambiguous God, a God too big to fathom or to  limit to the human good, is of meager use when it comes to building institu- tions and guiding religious and ethical projects.71 But that, according to Dean,  is precisely what motivates us to intervene in history, to take responsibility for  our beliefs and practices, to conventionalize the sacred, and to alter nature’s  “deepest and imperfect” divine character.72 As Kaufman intimates, theological  constructs, along with all the components of our religions’ kataphatic edifices,  put normative “qualifications” on ultimacy and allow us to engage and selec- tively nurture those historical trajectories—which are themselves modalities  of creativity—that yield pragmatically efficacious fruit, that nudge history in  humane and ecologically sane directions.73 For instance, God the liberator, while  implausible as a metaphysics of the divine, can—indeed does—still function to  symbolically marshal our sociopolitical energies toward those forces in natural  and cultural history, actual or possible, that promote peace, liberty, and justice  for all, especially the most vulnerable. This is why I promote a historicism that  is naturalistic and humanistic, a holistic historicism that deploys humanity’s  projected, provincial, provisional gods to bring out the best in God, as it were,  even as it insists on the relativizing indeterminateness and moral ambiguity  of ultimate reality in its spiritually breathtaking totality. As Wildman avers,  however misleading as literal depictions of ultimacy, “nothing in religion hap- pens without ... anthropomorphic constructions.” Our symbols, myths, and  traditions help us to creatively and discriminatingly navigate the valuational  71.

Kaufman, Jesus and Creativity (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2006), 7, 18;  Wildman, “Nature, God, Jesus, and Creativity,” 58, 60; Wildman, “The Ambiguous Heritage  and Perpetual Promise of Liberal Theology,” 60–61. 72.

Apophatic, pluralistic naturalism compels us to follow  scripture’s lead and also conventionalize the dark, destructive, demonic side  of the divine historical life, to come to theological, ethical, and liturgical grips  with the “abysmal” parts of nature’s “multidimensional axiological landscape,”  the parts indifferent, even inimical, to human interests.75 To return to libera- tion theology for the last time, a liberationist whose work engaged not only  the particularities of a specific social location but also the ambiguous whole of  history, would have to place God the liberator alongside nonliberative sacred  conventions. A few liberationists have, in fact, shown such theological audacity.  To cite just one example, womanist theologian Delores Williams scolds Cone  for ignoring the fact that the same God who brought the enslaved Hebrews out  of Egypt did not liberate Hagar and other non-Jewish slaves from bondage.  Even the Exodus itself, she reminds us, should be read as a “holistic story,”  climaxing with “the genocide of the Canaanites and the taking of their land.”  Black women, by identifying with the historical perspectives and experiences  of “those with whom the biblical writers have not identified,” are able to see a  much shadier, more capricious God, a God who lets some of  the oppressed go  free, a God who often sanctions violence in the name of liberation.76 All holistic  historicists, I am advising, need a theological conventionalism that is just as  bold, blunt, and broad as Williams’s, a conventionalism that is properly scaled  to their apophatic, pluralistic, naturalistic metaphysics of religious ultimacy, a  conventionalism that is capable of empowering them to wrestle, like Jacob of  old, with a God, a nature, a history that is big and unambiguously ambiguous.

Conclusion: Why Supernaturalists, Supranaturalists,   and Religious Naturalists Need Holistic Historicism In conclusion, a holistic historicist theology and its resultant ultimacy model,  apophatic, pluralistic naturalism, provide a historical and theological angle  74.

To be sure, it is the  anthropomorphic “topsides” of our religious ventures that make them exciting,  attractive, effective, and necessary,77 and none, in my view, has been more so  than liberation theology, which has given numerous oppressed communities  the courage to resist deplorable social evils. Yet, as Irvine keenly discerns, the  cultural shifts involved in modernization, including the “widening acceptance  of  a naturalistic, evolutionary account of  how the universe, and life within  it, came to be as it is,” has prompted a serious “crisis of confidence” among  theists and especially liberation theologians, challenging the claim that “God  is not just personal, but personally, efficaciously active in the world (and not  only that, but active particularly in defense of victims of history).”78 And that  is exactly why a holistic historicism is needed. By inviting already historically  conscious theologians, like liberation theologians, to evaluate doctrines both  against their own communal narratives, cultures, and experiences and against  the whole of human and natural history and the sciences that study it, a holistic  historicism can give them a more expansive contextualist foundation; a more  liberal, critical, global, interdisciplinary, and truth-seeking approach to theol- ogy;79 a more empirically grounded and naturalistic metaphysics of religious  ultimacy; a more defensible symbolic or conventionalist ontology of  divine  beings; and a more intellectually honest and humanistic basis for securing the  just ordering of the world.  But we religious naturalists stand to profit from holistic historicism, too.  Most of all, it keeps us mindful of the fact that our naturalistic concepts of  ultimacy are not read, in a direct, objective fashion, off  the face of the natural  world. Although receptive and responsive to the very real, mysterious, and am- biguous depths that nature manifests, they are still experiments in constructive  theology or, to employ a term that seems to be gaining traction, theopoetics.  They are fallible, perspectival, metaphorical, and thoroughly human creations  that arise in particular histories and reflect the contingencies, limitations, and  distinctive colorations of those histories. For holistic historicists, the density  77. See Wildman, “The Ambiguous Heritage and Perpetual Promise of Liberal Theology,” 61. 78. Irvine, “Liberation Theology in Late Modernity,” 929–30, 946. 79.

Accordingly, to accept a historicism  that is naturalistic and humanistic is to remember, with James, that “the trail  of the human serpent” is truly “over everything,”80 even religious naturalism,  even apophatic, pluralistic naturalism. 80.
