Public health aspects of bartonellosis ........ ............... 339 PREFACE The two manifestations of human bartonellosis in Oroya fever and verruga peruviana are so strikingly unlike that it is not remarkable that on occasion they have been considered to be distinct infections. It is of interest that this difference is not merely one of signs and symptoms but has its basis in the pathology of the two conditions. The failure of response of the vascu- lar endothelium to the multiplication of the bartonellae within its cells during the anemic phase of the infection constitutes an extreme contrast to its proliferation in the formation of the vascular nodules of the eruption. Doubtless there are intermediary stages between the two extremes, and in this study a suggestion has already been noted around superficial vessels in the skin. In all probability, the anemic and eruptive phases of the infection are based upon differences in the immunity reactions of the host, of which little is known. The geographical limitation of bartonellosis to certain Andean regions of South America is evidently based on its low infectivity as compared, for example, with an infection like tularemia, which is transmitted by contact of skin or mucous membrane with infected tissues as well as by ticks and various bloodsucking insects. Hence, bartonellosis is restricted to regions which ap- pear to correspond with the distribution of certain species of sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus. This weak infectivity is not based on the low survival proper- ties of Bartonella bacilliformis or on the paucity of the latter in blood or other tissues. With the blood teem- ing with organisms during much of the anemic period, it would be natural to expect accidental infections in medical attendants and transmission by various blood- sucking insects. Why the sandfly is so essential in transmission, and what is the distribution and the nature of the development of bartonellae in this insect, are questions which remain unanswered. As Dr. Weinman observes, the present work serves not only to present existing knowledge concerning bartonellosis and other blood infections, but to point out the unsolved problems in this interesting field. Iso- lated records of asymptomatic human infection were made by Battistini and others. The significance of such cases became apparent when Weinman and Pinkerton found that they were common; which seemed to signify that human beings in the endemic regions serve as reser- voirs of infection. To what extent infection also pre- vails in lower animals of such regions is not known, but it is probably significant that the monkey is the only animal in which experimental infection has been produced with any degree of regularity, and in this animal profound anemia such as that seen in the human infection rarely occurs. Important in the consideration of bartonellosis is the background of blood infections of lower animals. There was for a time notable reluctance to accept inclusions of the red cells or bodies occurring on their surface or in the plasma as micro-organisms. Their parasitic nature is now well established by experimental study and by reaction to drugs as well as by morphological study. Preparing a monograph on this subject in Pro- fessor Ilmile Brumpt's laboratory, Dr. Weinman. has maintained an interest in the so-called bartonelloses and other blood infections encountered in lower animals. His earlier observations concerning essential differences between Bartonella bacilliforinis of the human being and the bartonellalike organisms of lower animals (Weinman, 1935) led to the reclassification of the 243</page><page sequence="4">244 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY latter in the genus Haemnobartonella (Tyzzer and Wein- man, 1938). There has been a notable tendency, presumably due to precedent in regard to malaria and trypanosomiasis, to regard blood parasites as protozoa. Thus the name Eperythrozoon of itself indicates zoological rather than botanical affiliations. The cultivation of Bartonella bacilliformis by Noguchi and Battistini has led to the recognition of this organism as a flagellated bacillus, an important step forward in the understanding of this group of organisms. The grahamellae of various animals have since been successfully cultivated and are obviously bacteria. Furthermore, recent studies fur- nish no support of the view that either haemobartonellae or eperythrozoa are of the nature of protozoa. It would seem that this entire group of organisms should fall within the domain of the bacteriologist. Those who undertake investigation in this most interesting field will find a wealth of problems, whether in human bartonellosis or in the blood infections of lower ani- mals. The latter especially lend themselves to studies of splenic function and to the consideration of the broader aspects of immunity. Dr. Weinman has had personal experience with human bartonellosis and the animal parasites described herein. The present mono- graph should serve as a reliable, modern, and full source of information and reference; the South American lit- erature, which is so difficult of access, being particularly well represented. E. E. TYZZER</page><page sequence="5">INTRODUCTION Human bartonellosis is a unique disease, whose still unsolved problems are numerous, important, and, as intriguing as they have been, unfortunately complex and difficult of solution. Bartonella bacilliformis, the causative organism, was first described about 35 years ago. There then followed a period of intensive investi- gations of this parasite, which is distinctive in that it causes two apparently unrelated syndromes: a severe, often fatal, infectious febrile anemia, and a benign skin eruption. As a result, a mass of information concern- ing diseases due to this and related organisms has been acquired. Yet, while the subject is of increasing im- portance, no adequate modern summary of this knowl- edge exists. The present study was undertaken as an attempt to provide such a precis of pertinent and evalu- ated information. These conditions are particularly interesting because: (1) Human bartonellosis appears to be extending in epidemic form. Problems raised by the disease should be familiar in countries not yet invaded. (2) The comparative study of the animal bartonel- loses is capable of illuminating the etiology, pathogene- sis, and treatment of blood diseases. (3) The animal- parasites in question have a wide- spread distribution, and their possible presence in lab- oratory animals should be considered in the evaluation not only of investigations involving the blood and hemo- poietic organs, but also in very varied experimental procedures such as: deficient diets, blockade of the reticulo-endothelial system, experimental infections, tu- mor grafts, etc., whose effects may be considerably changed, even reversed by the presence of these micro- organisms. (4) A clearly-defined immunological function of the spleen has been demonstrated. This consists in the maintenance of an equilibrium between certain of these pathogenic parasites and their host so perfect that in- fection may never be apparent unless splenectomy is performed. The mechanism of this action is still ob- scure; successful analysis promises to yield information of an entirely new sort concerning the relation of the spleen to immunity. In treating these subjects, deliberate emphasis has been placed upon those aspects which require additional investigation. For the primary aim of this paper has been to instigate further research, not only to be a source of data already acquired but also to bring the remaining problems into focus and thus to act as a pro- vocative toward their solution. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It is a pleasure to record the co-operation obtained in the preparation of this monograph. Dr. E. E. Tyzzer, George Fabyan professor of com- parative pathology and tropical medicine, emeritus, has unfailingly made available his knowledge and experi- ence, a benefit which places the author very mtich in his debt; he has also read the manuscript and offered most valuable suggestions. The 1937 Harvard Expedition to Peru furnished much of the original material in this volume. To Dr. Richard Pearson Strong, professor of tropical medi- cine, emeritus, and to the fellow-members of that ex- pedition, Dr. Henry Pinkerton and Dr. Marshall Hertig, the author wishes to express his appreciation. Dr. Pinkerton has also made available unpublished gross autopsy reports of Oroya fever cases. Dr. Rene Jules Dubos, George Fabyan professor of comparative pathology and tropical medicine, has con- tributed much appreciated aid. The author thanks him and his colleagues, Dr. Donald L. Augustine and Dr. Joseph C. Bequaert, who have given help and advice on numerous occasions. To Dr. ]2mile Brumpt, professor of parasitology and medical natural history in the Medical Faculty of the University of Paris, in whose laboratory and through whose encouragement investigations on this. subject were begun, the author is indebted for data concerning the epidemic in Colombia. Dr. L. Patifio-Camargo, Director of the Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia e Investigaciones Medicas in Bogota, has furnished information on the present extent of bartonellosis in Colombia. Dr. Hugh S. Cumming, director of the Pan-Ameri- can Sanitary Bureau, provided transcripts of otherwise unobtainable literature, Dr. Aristides A. Moll, scientific editor of the Bulletin of the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau, made available the library of the Bulletin, and in the Army Medical Library Mr. Toepper and particu- larly Miss Duncan were most helpful. In the preparation of the manuscript, Dr. Katherine Drinker has given expert counsel; and particular ac- knowledgment is due the unremitting care of Miss Catherine M. Casassa, which has been priceless. The author very greatly appreciates the capable assistance of Mrs. Elizabeth G. Fuller, who has given most gener- ously of her time in the preparation of the index.

See Chapter IV. DEFINITION Bartonella Strong, Tyzzer, and Sellards (1915a, emend. Tyzzer and Weinman, 1939) is the generic name of micro-organisms here defined as: parasites of the erythrocytes, which also multiply in fixed tissue cells. On the red blood cells in stained films they appear as "rounded or oval forms or . . . slender, straight, curved or bent rods occurring either singly or in groups, but characteristically in chains of several segmenting organisms, sometimes swollen at one or both ends and frequently beaded" (Strong, Tyzzer, Brues, Sellards, and Gastiaburu', 1913), without dis- tinct differentiation of nucleus and cytoplasm. In the tissues they are situated within the cytoplasm of endo- thelial cells as isolated elements and grouped in rounded masses. These parasites occur spontaneously in man, and in the arthropod vectors; are endowed with independent motility; reproduce by binary division; and may be cultivated by unlimited serial transfers on cell-free media. There is but one species recognized: Bartonella bacil- liformis, which is known to be established only on the South American continent and perhaps in Central America. Human bartonellosis may be manifested either clinically, by one of the two syndromes consti- tuting Carrion's disease (Oroya fever or verruga pe- ruana), or as an asymptomatic infection. SYNONYMS AND SUGGESTED USAGE In the long history of human bartonellosis a varied terminology has been employed for its clinical mani- f estations. The cutaneous form was the earliest described, has the most extensive synonymy, and is now most widely known as verruca peruviana or verruga peruana. The following have also been used: verruga andicola (Sala- zar, 1858); verruga de sangre, v. blanda, v. de Castilla, v. de zapo, de quinua (Carrion, 1886); verruga de la Oroya (Matto, 1886); verruga nodular, and in French, verruga de crapaud, bouton des Andes (Odriozola, 1898). In Bolivia, a disease considered to be verruga is termed "sejtiti" (Mendoza, 1936). The other clinical entity, the anemic form or Oroya fever, has partial or complete synonyms in: verruga fever, malignant verruga fever, malarial typhus of 246</page><page sequence="7">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 247 Oroya, acute verrucous fever, malignant fever of the "quebradas," fievre grave de Carrion (Odriozola, 1898), severe wart fever (Darling, 1911), Guaitara verrucous fever (Patifio, 1939a), and perhaps "siete" in Bolivia.' Unfortunately, for the purposes of clear designation, use of these terms has not been uniform. Influenced doubtless by the common etiology of the two syndromes, as well as by the difficulties of classifying borderline and atypical cases, certain authors have tended to dis- regard the distinction between the two forms. This distinction is, however, based upon important differences in the clinical picture, in the diagnostic procedures em- ployed, in the prognosis, and in the pathology. To disregard these differences, and to refer to both forms indiscriminately as "verruga" may lead to obscurity or incomprehensibility. For example, to state that with a new form of therapy the mortality in an epidemic of "verruga" was reduced below 10 percent, may mean either that the therapy was valueless, since untreated verruga peruana is very rarely fatal, or the most suc- cessful therapy yet applied to Oroya fever, where the mortality in epidemics is greater than 40 percent. It appears advantageous then to follow the usage es- tablished by the older clinicians such as Odriozola, and unmistakably denote the clinical type reported. When it is desired to group the two types of cases and refer to them as a unit, the designation Carrion's disease (Alcedan, 1886) appears most suitable. Human bar- tonellosis is an even more inclusive term, comprising all types of infection including asymptomatic cases. The synonymy of Bartonella bacilliformis is given in the section on protistology (p. 268). HISTORY OF THE DISEASE The earliest records of verruga peruana are ailte- scriptural. This evidence is archaeological and indi- cates that the disease was known to the pre-Incaic in- habitants of Peru. Thus excavations have unearthed a great quantity of pottery in western South America. Numbers of the pots or "huacos" are anthropomorphic and executed with striking realism. Many depict rec- ognizable medical operations, such as trepanation, as well as diseased conditions. Among the latter, repre- sentations of verruga have been identified in material pertaining to the Chimu civilization. Illustrated exam- ples of such huacos may be found in Harcourt (1939) and Mazzini (1934). By the time the Spaniards arrived in Peru, the natives already distinguished verruga from other dis- eases. This evidence is linguistic and rests on the existence in the Keshua language, promptly recorded by the Spaniards, of special terms for the verruga lesion distinct from those employed for the common wart. While there is common agreement that the two condi- tions were so distinguished, there is none concerning 'It may be noted that Oroya fever is neither contracted nor endemic in the city of Oroya. the words employed. Thus Matto (1886) states that the indigenous word for verruga was Kceppo; while Vargas Fano gives Sirki (in Rebagliati, 1940), and Harcourt (1939) Ticti. Written references begin with the conquest. The very first group of Spaniards under Pizarro suffered from the unfamiliar disease of "berrugas" on their route south in 1531 to the conquest of Peru (Zarate, 1555; Pizarro, 1571). The disease occurred in epi- demic form at Coaque, in Ecuador, incapacitated a great many of the soldiers, and was of sufficient importance to be recorded in many of the early chronicles. For years the subject was of antiquarian interest only, since verruga was not subsequently reported from this region. Recently, however, endemic foci have been found in Ecuador, and in reference to the introduction of infec- tion, the nature of the Coaque epidemic has assumed a new importance. The historical evidence has been thor- oughly reviewed by Maldonado (1931), who concludes that the skin eruption was probably yaws and that the deaths were due to malaria. However, other authori- ties (Odriozola, 1898; Tello, 1909; Harvard, 1915) recognize verrugas in the description. Since the early records permit of equivocal interpretations, a solution of the matter on these grounds alone is probably impos- sible. It would be of considerable interest to deter- mine with modern methods whether bartonellosis is at present endemic in the Coaque region. The first medical publication dealing with the disease is, according to Valdiz'an (1925a), that of Gago de Vadillo, doctor of surgery, printed in 1630. All these early accounts were very fragmentary,2 and apparently they were very little bettered during the following two centuries. Thus Salazar, in 1858, could write that since he had not met with any description of the disease (i. e. verruga), the material which he was publishing was exclusively the result of his own investigations. The anemic form of the disease received even less attention until the 1870 epidemic. Yet, prior to this, it had been noted that members of the armed guard which accompanied ore shipments from Cerro de Pasco to Lima became ill en route. Some of these guards were Negroes, and it was striking to observe that "the blacks became whites" (Matto, 1886). In 1870 a highly fatal epidemic became the principal object of medical interest in Peru. It involved the personnel engaged in building the railroad from Lima to Oroya, with catastrophic effect. The mortality has been estimated at 7,000 deaths (Harvard, 1915), and this and later epidemics led to the popular saying that every crosstie in the railroad represented a human life. The nature of the epidemic was obscure, it appeared unfamiliar, and accordingly was designated by the term Oroya fever. 2 For more details concerning early history, see Maldonado (1931) and Valdiz'an (1925a; 1925b).</page><page sequence="8">248 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY In the numerous medical discussions which followed this outbreak, the contribution of Dr. Espinal is notable. According to Odriozola, from 1872 onwards Espinal maintained that verruga peruana and Oroya fever were manifestations of the same disease. As evidence, he cited the case of one of his patients, an American en- gineer, Wilson, who recovered from Oroya fever in Peru and returned to the United States, where he later suffered an attack of verruga. No publication by Espinal has been found, but Barrios (1875) and Odriozola (1898) assert his priority. Similar uni- tarian views were also expressed by Basadre 3 in 1873 (1885), by Salazar, Bambaren, Barrios, and others in 1875 (Avendanio, 1885; Odriozola, 1898), and by Alarco (Carrion, 1886). Yet the supporting evidence was scanty, and, like so many other etiological concepts, the unitarian view apparently was soon abandoned, to be regarded as only one more item in the history of the disease. Tlhus Arce (1914a) states that by 1885 no one any longer spoke of the etiological unity. Carrion's contribution made that same year was, how- ever, to have a stimulating and influential effect. This conscientious investigator had spent some vears accu- mulating observations on verruga peruana and was dissatisfied with the vagueness of the available data. In particular, knowledge of the early stages was very defective, which was considered unfortunate, since it would be advantageous to apply therapeutic measures as early as possible. Such deficiencies would, he was sure, be clarified by experimental inoculation, which might have the additional advantage of providing some in- formation concerning pathogenesis (Carrion, 1886). Accordingly he resolved to be inoculated with ver- ruga material. The experiment was performed on August 27, 1885. After an incubation period of 21 days. a disease developed which was clearly not verruga peruana. Carrion diagnosed it as Oroya fever (Medina et al., 1886), a result which came as a complete surprise to him (Arce, 1914a). The disease unfortunately pro- gressed with great rapidity toward a fatal outcome, and this promising investigator died oln October 5, 1885- 39 days after the inoculation and after 18 days of illness.4 The cardinal symptoms of his disease were: at first osseous, articular, and muscular pains, accompanied by fever and sometimes sweats, petechiae, an icteric tint, later followed by progressing pallor of the skin and mucosae, a pulse which remained rapid when the tem- perature was normal, a cardiac murmur later becoming audible to the patient, then anorexia, nausea and vomit- ing, and vertigo. Terminally, the red count was 1,- 085,000, the temperature became subnormal, while the pulse rate remained above 100, and complete nocturnal 3Avendafio (1885) states that Basadre antedated Espinal. 4An enthusiastic appreciation of Carrion, with biographical details, has been published by Marroquin (1935). delirium was noted (Medina et al., 1886). At the autopsy, pallor of the skin was noted, the liver was hypertrophied (1800 grams), as were the mesenteric lymph nodes, almost doubled in size, while the spleen was less heavy than usual (La Puente, Loli, and Vega, 1885). Carrion thus suffered from a typical clinical attack of Oroya fever and exhibited some of the character- istic post-mortem changes. It appears undeniable, there- fore, that after an inoculation of verruga material Carrion died of Oroya fever. The conclusion widely drawn was that he had demonstrated the etiological unity of the two syndromes. In homage, his name has subsequently been applied to the clinical manifestations of human bartonellosis. *Another important event takinlg place toward the close of the century was the publication by Odriozola in 1898 of his superb monograph, La Maladie de Car- rion oii la Verruga pe'ruvienne. Odriozola found the disease described in a mass of isolated observations, often contradictory or manifestly untrustworthv, and sometimes even treating mistakenly of other diseases altogether. After extensive experience and investiga- tions, it was his achievement to present in this mono- graph an orderly, critical, and brilliant study of the disease, enriched by numerous personal observations and contributions of importance, and as complete as the science of the time would allow. This work is still in- valuable, a testimony which can be offered to but few treatises of equivalent age! The cause of the disease was not recognized until 1905. Previously various speculations had been of- fered,5 and several different non-specific micro-organ- isms had been isolated from the blood and tissues.6 Finally, Barton in 1905 and in 1909 (1909) described what is now known as Bartonella bacilliformis. He stated that it was a living organism and the specific agent of Carrion's disease. Unfortunately the same author had previously described, as the cause of the disease, bacteria of the coli-typhoid group. Since this first view was rapidly disproved, the second did not subsequently obtain general acceptance. The prevailing opinion seems to have been that the bartonellae repre- sented some product of the red cell, either degenerative or of nuclear origin. Thus Aldana (1929) states that from 1909 onwards Barton's bodies were not consid- ered to be micro-organisms, but red cell alterations, of value in the diagnosis of Oroya fever, but not the causative agent.7 At this time an important contribution was made by Jadassohn and Seiffert. In 1910 they proved the in- 5 These are recorded in Odriozola's monograph. 6 Listed in the report of the 1913 Harvard Expedition to Peru (1915). 7 Biffi (1903) and Gastiaburu' (1903) saw and reported what are almost certainly these organisms before Barton, but con- . cluded that they were red cell granulations such as are seen in other anemias.</page><page sequence="9">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 249 fectious nature of verruga and demonstrated that it could be transmitted serially in monkeys. These re- sults were confirmed by Mayer, Rocha-Lima, and Werner (1913a) ; these authors and Rocha-Lima (1913) described in cells of the verrugas certain intracyto- plasmic structures which they classified as "chlamydo- zoa." This added still one more to the already long list of described incitants of the disease. The etiology of Oroya fever was finally determined by the 1913 Harvard Expedition to Peru (1915). These investigators-Strong, Tyzzer, Sellards, Brues, and Gastiaburu'-made original contributions of the first importance to knowledge of the cause and pathol- ogy of Oroya fever. They confirmed Barton's findings in full, and their observations further indicated that the red cell structures could hardly be degeneration products since they exhibited independent motility. It was fur- ther discovered that Barton's bodies occurred in great numbers in tissue cells unassociated with erythrocytes. In view of this evidence the structures were considered parasites, to which the name Bartonella bacilliformis was given. In the same report the very distinctive lesion, con- sidered pathognomonic, of Oroya fever was described for the first time, and the pathology of Oroya fever was fully described and well illustrated. The etiology of verruga, however, still remained ob- scure, and it was not until 1926, when Noguchi and Battistini published their method for the serial cultiva- tion of Bartonella bacilliformis, that a solution of the problem was in sight. Cultures derived from either verruga or Oroya fever patients contained the same micro-organism. Such cultures, in the hands of No- guchi and his collaborators, produced in monkeys skin nodules in which a micro-organism could be demon- strated. The organisms in culture and in the lesion were consistent morphologically, and from the blood of the infected animals organisms were regularly re- covered which were identical with those inoculated. These results appeared to establish etiological uni- tarianism, but full confirmation from other laboratories was not obtained. Finally, however, the unitarian view appeared to be proved beyond any doubt from the re- sults obtained by the 1937 Harvard Expedition to Peru.8 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION At present, bartonellosis is known to be established only in western South America. On this continent the disease is contracted in a narrow strip comprising the mountainous region constituted chiefly by the western and central Cordilleras of the Andes. The zone ex- tends about a thousand miles, from approximately 20 north of the equator to 130 south latitude; its width in Peru, where the geographical distribution has been most 8 One or more phases of the subject have been reviewed by Regaud (1930) and S'anchez Palacios (1927-1928).

Within this area the endemic foci are reported to be irregularly distributed; however, much of the territory is difficult of access and has not been adequately sur- veyed. The known infected areas comprise portions of Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. The Peruvian foci have been studied in detail and were recently mapped bv Reba- gliati (1940). It is noteworthy that in certain areas 9 Oroya f ever is said to be rare and the benign eruptive form of the infection prevails. Bartonellogis and leish- maniosis may co-exislt, b.ut the latter has a more exten- sive distribution (Weiss, 1933). The recognized Ecuadorian foci are in the southwest. Numerous cases of "a peculiar disease," constituted by an eruption of dull red papules which never suppurated, a variable degree of anemia, and f ever, were reported in 1883 from Zaruma in the province of El Oro (Hall, 1883). In the same province Hertig has recentlv 9 The department of Ancash (Antunez, 1914; Ortiz, 1914; Martinez, 1922; Weiss, 1933). The Oroya fever cases which do occur there are very severe (Odriozola, 1898).</page><page sequence="10">250 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY (1940b) proved bartonellosis to exist by cultural, his- tological, and inoculation studies. Another focus is in Loja province in the Zumba region, near the Peruvian border (Montalvan, 1940; Moral, 1942). The disease has not been reported from the vicinity of Coaque. The most northern of the infected areas is in Co- lombia. In the department of Narifio endemic foci centering about the city of Pasto comprise an area estimated at 1,000 square kilometers (Patifio, 1939b). In Bolivia conditions thought, but not yet proved, to be Carrion's disease have been reported. Notably in the Yungas region a skin affection known locally as "sejtiti" is said to include cases of verruga (Mendoza, 1936); whereas "siete" would apply to Oroya fever (Trigo Arce). Stiles (1939) in South Yungas has seen no indigenous, but only imported, cases. The possibility of Central American foci has been raised, but their existence has not been definitely estab- lished. Weiss (1933) encountered in Puerto Castilla, Honduras, a case which from the clinical and histologi- cal description could not be distinguished from verruga. Rocha-Lima (1925) studied sections from this case and reported finding angioblasts with intracytoplasmic in- clusions which he elsewhere considered characteristic of verruga, yet here he hesitated to give this diagnosis. The results of blood cultures and of animal inoculations might have been decisive in this case. Patifio (1940e) and Patifio, Cifuentes, and S'anchez Herrera (1940) believe that the disease existed and probably now exists in the mountainous regions of Guatemala. The evidence is historical, and from it Sa'nchez (1936?) considers the disease referred to, "tlacaconanoatl," was smallpox rather than yaws, and does not even consider verruga. Finally, outside the American continents two cases must be considered. Beaumanoir in 1885 reported the disease in a patient never having lived elsewhere than on the islands of Mauritius and Reu'nion; no subsequent reports of cases from these islands have been found. The case observed by Fontoynont and Carouzeau in Madagascar (1910) was, as the authors conclude, prob- ably not verruga. Thus the old view that bartonellosis is of limited occurrence has substantially been upheld; all known foci are in western South America. The distribution known today, however, can by no means be considered final. It appears likely that adequate surveys will reveal the disease in the mountainous region north of the present known limit. Quite another possibility should also be kept in mind. Verrugalike eruptions have been found in parts of South America where bartonellosis is un- reported. In some cases detailed clinical and histo- logical study has shown no distinguishing difference between true verrugas and these "pseudoverrugas." 10 Should the latter prove to be due to bartonella infection, 10 More details are given on p. 263 (differential diagnosis of verruga peruana). a very extensive revision of our ideas on the distribu- tion of bartonellosis will be enforced.10a HUMAN BARTONELLOSIS INCUBATION Fifteen to 40 (Odriozola, 1898) and usually about 20 days (Monge, 1912a) elapse between the presumed date of infection and the first symptoms. More exact data concerning four experimental human infections furnish 16 to 21 days-figures which are perhaps some- what near the minimum.11 This period has been stated to vary from 12 days (Arce, 1931) to 8 months (Carrion, 1886). Quite possibly, the asymptomatic infections which will be de- scribed later (p. 267) may continue for even longer periods without external manifestations. ONSET AND INVASION Extreme variation is noted both in duration and in intensity of the symptoms. Those which are most con- stant, pain and fever, are nonspecific; accordingly, di- agnosis is rarely made at this time. The onset may be abrupt and accompanied by fever reaching 1040 F. (400 C.), chills, abundant sweats, and intense pain, to be followed by some regression of the symptoms, or it may be more gradual. In the latter case, cephalalgia, arthralgias, ostealgias, and myalgias may be the dominant symptoms. These are intermit- tent, recur often at daily intervals, and are frequently accompanied by some fever. These symptoms persist throughout the course of the disease and will be dis- cussed in detail. The clinical picture at this time varies somewhat according to the syndrome which is to follow. If it be Oroya fever, the symptoms are often marked, and bouts of intense pain and fever are more often noted. This period lasts from a few days to one or two weeks (Odriozola, 1898; Jaramillo, 1939). When verruga peruana is to succeed, the fever tends to be more moderate, often not rising above 100.50 F. (380 C.), and is interrupted by apyretic periods. Just before the eruption, however, the fever often mounts. 10a Otto and Rezek (1943) have just described what they term a new type of human bartonella infection. Their patient, a male Floridian, suffered from anemia and slight fever, had a low platelet count, and an enlarged liver and spleen. In blood films, bodies considered to be parasites of the bartonella group and which increased four-fold after splenectomy, were observed. Definite proof that the bodies are independent living organisms is not given in this preliminary paper. The authors consider it to be a bartonella which is not B. bacilliformis, note a resem- blance to H. canis, and suggest that the latter may be patho- genic for man. 11 Incubation period, experimental human bartonellosis: Subject Carri6n "a Chilian" Garcia Rossell Kuczynski-Godard Material Inoculated Verruga scrapings Verruga tissue Blood Cultures Incubation 2 1 days 16 days 20 days 17 days lst Symptom Recorded Pain Verrugas "Febrile episode" Pain</page><page sequence="11">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 251 The joint and bone pains are, at this time, the most constant and characteristic feature (Carrion, 1886). A certain degree of anemia is often noted, and this is almost always the case if the eruption occurs during convalescence from Oroya fever. At the site of the eruption, localized cedema and pricking and shooting pains may occur. Odriozola pointed out that the first verrugas may not be perceived because of their loca- tion, but may cause some outstanding symptom: dys- phonia when situated on the vocal cords; epistaxis when on the nasal mucosa, etc. The duration of this period can be less than 16 days in experimental infec- tions. Verrugas may appear three to four days after remission of the anemia in Oroya fever, but they also occur as late as 18 months afterward (Weiss, 1933). Finally, a mild and very prolonged invasion has been described as a "larval form" or "verrucous rheuma- tism." For months or even years, the only obvious symptoms are muscle, bone, and joint pains; eventually these intensify and the eruption appears (Antuinez, 1914; Ortiz, 1914). Although recent confirmation of these observations has not been found, it seems prob- able that there is a graded series of response to the infection, ranging from carrier patients who show no evident reaction (asymptomatic cases) to those in whom marked symptoms develop shortly after exposure. CLINICAL TYPES Three forms are described: the anemic (Oroya fever); the eruptive (verruga peruana); and mixed types with certain manifestations of both the two pre- ceding forms. OROYA FEVER Definition A febrile anemia of rapid evolution and high mortal- ity caused by Bartonella baciliformis, Oroya fever is triply characterized by parasitological, hematological, and pathological findings. In this form erythrocytic parasites are numerous; the anemia is accompanied by marked regeneration, and is of a macrocytic type; there is a distinctive lesion of vascular endothelial cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, etc. Period of Progressive Anemia This stage extends from the invasion to convales- cence or death. In a representative case, the pains and fever intensify but are soon overshadowed by the rap- idly progressing anemia. The erythrocyte and hemo- globin values fall to 25 percent of normal. Pallor is of the most extreme degree save when mixed with icterus. Vertigo is at first caused by slight movement; soon the same stimuilus produces syncope. At night, attacks of pain, fever, and delirium render sleep difficult and fitful. Soon prostration becomes marked, and the pa- tient, avoiding all motion, not only from weakness, but to lessen pain and faintness, remains in a curiously fixed, statuesque position. Finally, with an extreme degree of exhaustion and notable apathy, he awaits the outcome, which is usually evident in from three to five weeks. Duration.-Fulminating cases may evolve in 10 days (Monge, 1912b; 1925b). The usual fatal termination is at the end of about 30 days (Odriozola, 1898); in certain chronic or relapsing forms, after three or four months (Rebagliati, 1940). Improvement is usually manifest at the end of four or five weeks (Odriozola, 1898); while convalescence is often interrupted toward the end of the first month by the eruption of verruga peruana. Signs and symptoms.-These derive in great part from the oligocythemia and its consequent effects. Pallor.-The skin and mucosae become extremely pale. Plaster-colored or translucent and alabasterlike in light-skinned persons, the skin appears ashen or sandy in those of darker complexion, or when icterus is present. Slight yellowness is noted in many patients, often distinct only in the sclerae; occasionally there is frank and generalized icterus. The pulse.-Notably accelerated when the anemia is marked, the pulse remains rapid during afebrile periods. Thus 120 to 140 pulsations may accompany a normal temperature. Cardiac murmurs are most common at the base (Odriozola, 1898; Monge, 1912b); they are systolic, and intermittent or continuous (Odriozola, 1898). Propagation along the neck vessels is frequent, often perceptible to the patient, who complains of a distressing humming in the ears. The neck arteries at such times may beat with a vermicular motion. Pre- cordial anguish is a prominent symptom (Jaramillo, 1939). Fremitus in the precordial region with arterial propagation is less common (Odriozola, 1898). The blood pressure is low in all cases (Jaramillo, 1939). Polypnea.-Constant and intense (Barton, 1911), the rapid breathing has no adequate stethoscopic signs to explain it (Jaramillo, 1939). Later, signs of conges- tion and inflammation may be found, usually at the bases, and seriously aggravate the prognosis (Odriozola, 1898). Vertigo.-At first dizziness is induced by slight movements, even in the prone position. Later the same stimuli produce syncope. Thus any movement, since it also produces pain, is sedulously avoided, and, in Od- riozola's well-chosen phrase, the patient appears petri- fied. Skin lesions.-Petechiae occur frequently (Escomel, 1938). Most common on the neck, face, and extremi- ties, they also occur on the abdomen and chest (Odrio- zola, 1898) and in the skin folds of the large articula- tions (Jaramillo, 1939). From these, verrugas may later develop. Pigmented areas were described by Jaramillo (1939) in the Colombian epidemic as gray and black streaks on the gums and inner surfaces of the cheeks, whereas on the abdomen and anterior and</page><page sequence="12">252 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY internal aspect of the thighs he reports grayish pig- mented areas, sometimes confluent so as to constitute large, slightly elevated surfaces separated by normal skin. Ortega (1939) noted a generalized macular ex- anthema; typhus was not stated to have been excluded. Hemorrhages.-Not uncommon, hemorrhages may be abundant. Epistaxis is most frequent (Odriozola, 1898). Hemorrhage from other orifices has been at- tributed to "internal verrugas"; it will be seen that this diagnosis is often made without supporting histo- logical evidence (p. 262). Oedema.-Frequent, moderate in degree, usually first noted at the ankles, the oedema may ascend to the knees. Later in the disease, localized oedema may precede the verrugas (Odriozola, 1898). Pain.-This constitutes an outstanding symptom. It occurs regularly, is-often the initial complaint, and may persist during convalescence. The most common type is referred to the articulations and the bones, and is predominant or is accentuated at night and during ris- ing fever. The arthralgias most frequently involve the small articulations of the hands and feet, the knees, and the ankles (Odriozola, 1898). They shift from joint to joint at short intervals, but are rarely attended with swelling or redness. The ostealgias are variously sit- uated but particularly marked at the epiphyses of the long bones (Jaramillo, 1939). They may be provoked by pressure, particularly on the sternum (Monge, 1925b). Cephalalgia is common and may be either frontal or hemicranial (Odriozola, 1898). It responds poorly to analgesics and has been thought to be of osseous origin (Jaramillo, 1939). Rachialgia, also frequent, is a source of great discomfort. Muscular pains are of two types. Contusive pains are more frequent in the legs and thighs; cramps, in the calves and the sternomastoid muscle (Odriozola, 1898). These pains are all intermittent, of variable duration, accentuated at night and during febrile exacerbations, provoked or aggravated by movement, and consequently cause the avoidance of any motion. Should walking become necessary, it is attended with extreme discom- fort and a peculiar sensation as though the bones were breaking. Fever.-Hyperthermia is always present at some time and is extremely variable (Mimbela, 1897). Com- pletely irregular, remittent, and intermittent types oc- cur. The remittent type seems most common; the maximum varies between 101.30 F. (38.50 C.) and 1040 F. (400 C.), the daily spread usually being not more than 20 F. The intermittent type has daily ex- acerbations, or occasionally a tertian type, apparently in the absence of malarial infection, may occur. In the terminal stages of fatal cases, the fever either reascends to or remains near 1040 F. (400 C.), or hypothermia is seen, reaching 96.80 F. (36? C.) in the morning and normal values in the evening. The latter is of more immediately unfavorable prognosis. Sweats ac- company the fever, particularly at the beginning of the disease and tend to disappear when the anemia is marked (Odriozola, 1898). Enlargement of the lymph nodes.-At the physical examination this is the most characteristic finding. The enlarged nodes are easily appreciable where super- ficial (neck, supraclavicular and carotid regions, groin, axilla, etc.) ; if embonpoint does not prevent, the mesen- teric nodes may also be palpated. The spleen.-This organ is often of normal size (Odriozola, 1898; Monge, 1912b, 1925b; Jaramillo, 1939). If splenomegaly does occur, a marked reduc- tion in size may follow the verruga eruption (Odriozola, 1898). Hepatomegaly.-Enlargement of the liver is more common than splenomegaly, and the swollen organ may be sensitive to palpation. Nervous symptoms.-Some type of nervous manifes- tation is regularly present. The tendency to vertigo and its progression to syncope has been described (p. 251). Insomnia is a usual and often persistent com- plaint, to which the nocturnal accentuation of the pains and fever contribute. Delirium sometimes occurs, usu- ally when the red count has fallen to near 1,000,000; it is most often tranquil, but there may be some excita- tion (Valdiz'an, 1919). Gastro-intestinal symptoms.-Many have been de- scribed, not always with due care to exclude other causes. Nausea and vomiting, contributing to, and combined with, anorexia, are usually seen during the febrile periods. The tongue is coated at the center, red at the point and edges (Jaramillo, 1939). An in- tractable diarrhea provoking intense thirst may be seen (Monge, 1912b). It is at first fecal, then becomes serous, sometimes mixed with blood (Odriozola, 1898). The symptoms recounted thus far have been fre- quently observed and appear to form an integral part of the rich clinical picture of Oroya fever. In addi- tion, certain other symptoms or states, which are either extremely rare or not proved to be caused exclusively by bartonella, have been described. These are: various nervous and encephalitic symptoms seen during the pre- eruptive period 12 (Quiroga y Mena, 1889), tetanoid convulsions with generalized rigidity and trismus (Or- tega, 1939), and pneumonia with multiple foci (Man- rique and Rocha, 1937). An additional reason for caution in considering these conditions an inherent part of Oroya fever is the 12 Jim6nez (1938) autopsied a case of Oroya fever diagnosed clinically as a "nervous form of Carrion's disease." Cysticerci were found covering the whole of the brain, and one large cyst was situated within the pyramidal tract, whereas none of the brain lesions could be attributed to bartonella. See p. 262 for a description of the nervous symptoms described during verruga peruana.</page><page sequence="13">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 253 apparently high incidence of secondary infection by extraneous bacteria. Secondary infections.-Barton, it will be recalled, initially described a paratyphoidlike organism as the cause of Oroya fever. Subsequently, non-specific or- ganisms, particularly of the coli-typhoid group, have repeatedly been isolated from Oroya fever patients, particularly in cases which terminated fatally. Thus Ribeyro (1933) reported on 19 cases of Oroya fever; from six, an organism referred to as a beta para- typhoid was isolated; all six died. Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938) had 16 deaths in their series; in four a paratyphoid organism was obtained from blood cul- tures, and in three others meningitis or pneumonia was found at autopsy. One case with paratyphoid B septi- cemia recovered. Hercelles (1935a) reported on cultures made during three years from the blood of patients in all stages of the disease, including the eruptive; 27 of 256 blood cultures (_ 11 percent) showed secondary infection. The bacteria found were: Cases Percent B. coli ........ ........... 15 55 "Alpha" paratyphoid ............... 2 9 "Beta" paratyphoid ............... 8 28 B. typhosum ....... ........ 1 4 Enterococcus ....... ........ 1 4 Of the 27, 10 died (37 percent); of the remaining 229 without secondary infection, 52 died (23 percent). In the 62 fatal cases, 10 (16 percent) showed secondary infection. In Colombia, Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b) recently report that none of the cultures from the blood of 20 fatal cases showed secondary infection. From these data it appears that, in certain series at least, the incidence of secondary infection is consider- able, and somewhat higher in fatal than in non-fatal cases. Weiss (1927a) explains this by a condition of generally lowered immunity which he states prevails during Oroya fever (p. 278). A different hypothesis, affording an explanation of certain cases, is offered in the section on asymptomatic infection (p. 268). Laboratory examinations.-Bartonella bacilliformis, the conclusive diagnostic element, may be seen in blood films before the anemia is marked, i. e. with a red cell count of 4,210,000 (Aldana, 1929). This is excep- tional; usually with more than 4,000,000 erythrocytes no parasites are visible (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). As the anemia progresses, the bartonellae be- come more frequent with a rough inverse proportionality to the red count. With 1,000,000 red cells, more than 90 percent of the erythrocytes may be parasitized. On any one cell parasites may be single or multiple. Normocytes and microcytes are more frequently para- sitized than macrocytes (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938); reticulocytes are also infected. On the latter both the bartonellae and the reticulum can be shown with a combined cresyl blue Giemsa strain. The para- sites are distributed apparently without reference to the reticulum (Weinman and Pinkerton), which finding does not support Hercelles' view (1936) that barto- nellae are found only on reticulocytes because they become entangled in the reticulum. Barton (1909) found immature red cells parasitized; this has been repeatedly confirmed. Thus circulating normoblasts (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915) were found infected, and Mackehenie (1930b) has reported barto- nellae in megaloblasts and erythroblasts. Visible infection lasts for some days in favorable cases, then disappears, sometimes very suddenly. This coincides with the period when signs of abnormal blood destruction cease, and is usually a favorable sign. In cases of secondary infection death may supervene after blood films are negative (Hurtado et al., 1938). Para- sitic relapses occur, and in one case seen by the author a relapse coincided with a malarial attack. When para- sites are no longer visible, they may still be recovered in cultures. The blood changes.-Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938) have carefully studied hematological alterations in more than 40 patients in various stages of the dis- ease; this recent documentation has furnished a valuable part of the material to be presented. The erythrocyte count.-Only 2,000,000 red cells may be found at the first examination, and the count is near 1,000,000 in all severe cases. Values as low as 500,000 have been reported (Monge, 1912b), and with 800,000, recovery is still possible (Rebagliati, 1940).13, 14 The rate of decrease.- The reduction is often star- tling: e. g., to less than 1,000,000 in 4 days after the apparent onset (Monge, 1912b). During 15 days one patient lost more than one quart of erythrocytes (1200 cc.), and nearly one pound of hemoglobin (400 gm.) (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Hemoglobin.-This pigment follows a similar de- crease. It may fall as low as 2.34 gm. per 100 cc., 15 percent of the normal 15.65 gm. With less than 1,- 000,000 red cells, the average hemoglobin content was 3.34 gm. per 100 cc. of blood; between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000, 5.17 gm.; and between 2,000,000 and 3,000,- 000, 7.64 gm. When the red cell counts are somewhat below 4,000,000, the erythrocytes are more reduced than the hemoglobin (Hurtado et al., 1938). The color in- dex then becomes greater than 1. Macrocytosis.-Enlargement of the average size of the red cell is a constant finding. According to Strong (1940), "Bartonella anemia is the only macrocvtic anemia due to a micro-organism of the blood." Botlh the diameter and, proportionately more, the thickness are increased. This results in increased cell volume as 13 These low erythrocyte counts result in some cases partly from a dilution effect caused by over-production of plasma (p. 255). 14Jaramillo (1939) describes an initial poly-erythrocythemia. It is not stated that the effect of altitude was excluded.</page><page sequence="14">254 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY well as a change of shape, the concavity becoming less marked than normally. The volume increase is in pro- portion to the gravity of the anemia; with a count be- tween 2,000,000 and 3,000,000, the volume is 102.6 x3; between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000, 123.8_L3 ; below 1,000,- 000, 143.5,u3 (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). 15 The erythrocyte thus increases both in hemoglobin content and in volume. The volume increase is the greater, thus resulting in a decrease in the cellular con- centration of hemoglobin. The anemia is accordingly classified as hypochromic (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Hematocrit readings.-Expressed as the percentage of the volume occupied by the erythrocytes in 100 cc. of blood, the hematocrit values were: for a count 5,- 000,000 to 6,000,000, 42.6 percent; between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000, 39.8 percent; between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000, 33.5 percent; between 2,000,000 and 3,000,- 000, 25.8 percent; between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000, 17.7 percent; and below 1,000,000, 11.3 percent (Hur- tado, Pons, and Merino, 1938).16 Red cell fragility is not significantly altered (Jara- millo, 1939), although some subjects may show a slight increase (Monge, 1911; Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and polychromatophilia are regularly found; basophil stippling and Cabot rings may be seen (Monge and Weiss, 1930). Macrocytes measure as much as 124 in their longest diameter (Biffi, 1903). Microcytes are abundant although microblasts are rare (Monge, 1911). Immature erythrocytes of the most varied sorts are found. Reticulocytes and cells with Jolly bodies are common. Normoblasts, both ortho- and polychromato- phil, average 2,000 per mm.3 and they may reach 15,300 (Monge, 1911; 1912b). Megaloblasts.-Frequently found, megaloblasts are not constantly present (Monge and Weiss, 1930). They almost always occur when the total erythrocyte count is below 1,500,000. Average numbers are 200 per mm.3; they increase markedly in fulminating cases and may reach 3,400 per mm.3 (Monge, 1911; 1912b). An even more primitive cell, the hemocytoblast, has been reported in circulation (Monge and Weiss, 1930; Weiss, 1933). Reticulocytes.-These cells were apparently first stud- ied by Gastiaburui and Rebagliati (1909). Present in almost all cases, they are increased in inverse proportion to the total erythrocyte count, and may constitute 68.1 percent of the red cells (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Liver preparations, even when administered intramuscularly (Hurtado et al., 1938), cause only a slight increase (Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez, 1941b). Leucocytes.-Contrary to common statement. the white cells show no constant quantitative change. Leu- 15 Normal value given for inhabitants of the region is 89.7/2. 16 Normal value given as 47.0 percent. cocytosis may occur (Monge and Weiss, 1930; Esco- mel, 1938), with counts of 20,000 not uncommon (Monge, 1912b). Conversely, leucopenia may prevail throughout the disease, or leucocytosis and leucopenia may alternate (Manrique and Rocha, 1937). Extreme variations in different patients were noted by Jaramillo (1939); counts ranged from 3,200 to 50,800. When cases were divided in respect to secondary infection, patients with Oroya fever only had normal counts, oc- casionally leucopenia; those with secondary infection, leucocytosis (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Immature leucocytes are commonly found in the blood. In the myeloid series, forms with curved or lobed nuclei, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes, and myeloblasts; in the lymphoid, prolymphocytes and lymphoblasts; and in the monocyte, monoblasts and young monocytes have all been reported (Monge and Weiss,. 1930). Because of these findings Monge and Weiss suggest that Oroya fever might be classed in the group of the leukanemias. Plasma cells are occasionally present, but never constituted more than 2 percent of the white cells (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Abnormal leucocytes have also been reported; neutro- philes with vacuolated cytoplasm appear shortly before death (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Monge (1911) observed the vacuolated cells as well as forms with pycnotic nuclei, macrophages with double and di- viding nuclei, and normal polymorphonuclears of small size. The cell described as a macrophage with acido- philic granulations may have been a monocyte containing bartonellae such as were seen by Weiss (1927a) and Weinman and Pinkerton. Macrophages may contain parasitized red cells (Weiss, 1927a). Leutcocyte differential count.-Variation of the white cells according to the stage of the disease has been reported (Monge, 1912b). Hercelles (1936) found initial lymphopenia in all cases. During the progress of the anemia mononuclear cells decrease and eosino- phils disappear, but later there is a reversal in this trend which constitutes the "hematic crisis" and is of good prognosis (Monge, 1912b). Hurtado, Pons, and Me- rino (1938) observed an increase in lymphocytes, mono- cytes, and eosinophiles, either singly or in various com- binations; this took place at about the time signs of blood destruction ceased and parasites disappeared. The following differential count is based on 21 ob- servations, taken at unspecified periods of the disease in patients without secondary infection and whose ery- throcyte count was below 2,500,000. Granulocytes Eosinophiles ............... ......... 2.0 percent Basophiles .................... ...... 0.1 percent Neutrophiles Myelocytes ............. ......... 1.0 percent Juvenile forms .......... ......... 5.5 percent Rod forms .............. ......... 20.0 percent Segmented .............. ......... 37.0 percent Lymphocytes ........................... 28.5 percent Monocytes ............................. 6.0 percent</page><page sequence="15">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 255 In another group of pure infections, with counts above 2,500,000, and possibly including some verruga cases, the lymphocytes averaged 34.5 percent; mono- cytes, 8.2 percent; eosinophiles 2.5 percent (Hurtado et al., 1938). Platelets.-Apparently the thrombocytes have been little studied. Manrique and Rocha (1937) report that some cases show a decrease in numbers. Since hemor- rhage is not infrequent in Oroya fever, it might prove most interesting to have more detailed information. Non-cellular components.- Plasma volume is in- creased and may more than compensate for the volume of red cells lost. In such cases, estimation of the anemia by the usual procedure, numeration of the erythrocytes in a unit volume of whole blood, is slightly misleading. During convalescence there is a reversal of the process. A count of 4,000,000 is reached by production of red cells, and further increase follows on plasma with- drawal (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Lytic substances.-No hemolysins have been found in the serum. Monge (1911) looked for heterohemoly- sins, utilizing the serum of "sangre verrucosa" and nor- mal red cells. Guzm'an Barron (1926) observed no autohemolysins in 17 cases of Oroya fever, utilizing various techniques including the Donath-Landsteiner cold incubation; nor any heterohemolysins in the serum of eruptive patients for the red cells of anemic cases. Auto-agglutinins were described in some cases by Monge (1911); but this has not been generally con- firmed. Notably, Guzm'an Barron (1926) found no auto-agglutinins in 17 cases of Oroya fever, nor hetero- agglutinins for the red cells of anemic patients in sera from eruptive cases. The Bordet-Wassermann test was negative in two cases with visible bartonellae in the blood (Harvard, 1915). Positive non-specific results were obtained in Henry's reaction, the Gate-Papacostas formol-gel test. and the flocculation of serum globulins with distilled water (Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez, 1941b). Coagulation time was normal in all cases; the sedi- mentation rate much increased, giving values ranging between 100 and' 172 mm. in one hour with Wester- green's technique (Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez, 1941b). Blood bilirubin.-The concentration of this pigment has been repeatedly studied in an effort to explain both the icterus and the nature of the anemia. Although Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b) found normal values for blood bilirubin and the icteric index, more frequently abnormal variations have been observed. Weiss reported cases giving a positive van den Bergh test in both direct and indirect forms (1927a; 1933). Guzman Barron (1926) obtained 16 positive van den Bergh reactions from 17 markedly anemic cases. Hur- tado, Pons, and Merino (1938) noted hyperbilirubine- mia in the majority of cases. It was most frequent and intense when the anemia was most marked, and was often more accentuated in the last days before death. However, the findings were not altogether uniform. Some cases showed a decrease or disappearance of the bilirubin before the anemia reached its height. Also, in all stages where the erythrocyte count was above 1,000,000, some patients showed no increase. Thus with the red cell count between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000, 17 percent had no increased bilirubin; between 2,000,- 000 and 3,000,000, 25 percent; and between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000, 38 percent. In about half of 93 observations made at various stages of the disease, sufficient pigment was present for quantitative estimations. The average amount of bili- rubin was 2.07 mg. per 100 cc. of plasma; the highest, 8.40 mg. These results were obtained by direct dosage; the icteric index method gave similar results. The van den Bergh was positive with the indirect technique, negative with the direct, which led to the conclusion that the cause was not blockage of the hepatic excre- tory canals (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Hemoglobinemia was not found, nor has it been re- ported (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Blood cholesterin decreases slightly during the early stages; when the anemia is very severe, it may be as low as 0.98 gm. per liter (Guzman Barron, 1931). The urine.-Albumin amounting to 0.30 gm. per liter may be found during the febrile periods and may be accompanied by granular, hyaline, and hemorrhagic cylinders (Pimentel, 1913). Glucose is absent (Odri- ozola, 1898). Monge (1912a) stated that indican was constantly present in the urine; no subsequent report on this subject has been encountered. Hemoglobinuria was reported as an exceptional finding by Antuxnez (1914); however, other causes, such as malaria, were not specifically excluded, and the observation has not since been confirmed. The diazo-reaction and Weiss's test were sometimes positive in unspecified periods of the disease, presumably Oroya fever; their significance was not determined (Guzm'an Barron, 1926). Urinary pigments.-Urobilin (Monge, 1912a; Weiss, 1933) and urobilinogen (Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez, 1941b) have been found frequently. No bilirubin, however, occurred even in those cases with high blood bilirubin (Guzmran Barron, 1926). Gastric contents.-Manrique and Rocha (1937) found hlypochlorhydria to be frequent and noted some cases of complete achylia. Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938) report the secretory function of the stomach diminished in almost all cases and in various stages of the disease, including some of verruga. The decrease bore no rela- tion to the degree of anemia. The total acidity was low, hydrochloric acid low or absent. In 62.5 percent of their observations, achlorhydria was observed after the alcohol test meal; seven such patients were given histamine, and two produced no hydrochloric acid. The gastric enzymes, pepsinogen and pepsin, were also some- times diminished.</page><page sequence="16">256 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Investigations concerning pigments in the feces ap- parently have not yet been made. Evolution.-In fulminating cases death may occur in 10 days (Monge, 1925b). These rapidly fatal forms are more common in patients with pre-existing visceral lesions (Jaramillo, 1939). The usual duration of the fatal cases is about three to four weeks (Odriozola, 1898). Recovery is usually indicated by a decrease in the fever; some symptoms diminish, others disappear, the bartonellae decrease or vanish, and the blood count stabilizes, then increases. For some time, however, the nocturnal bouts of pain and fever persist. The red count approaches normal values at the end of five weeks or so, and then convalescence usually begins (Odriozola, 1898), but may be as late as the seventieth day (Patifio, 1940c). The disease sometimes terminates with the convales- cence; this is apparently both unusual and unpredictable. In the ordinary recovered case, Oroya fever is followed at the end of a variable period, often about a month, by an eruption of verruga peruana. Exceptionallv a second attack of Oroya fever may occur after the dis- appearance of a short-lived eruption (Odriozola, 1898). Diagnosis The history of residence should suggest the diagnosis, which is confirmed by laboratory examinations. The symptoms can be quite misleading, particularly before the anemia is marked. Thus the arthralgias and fever have suggested acute articular rheumatism, and from the other clinical findings various diseases may be simulated, such as typhoid fever, brucellosis, etc. If jaundice is conspicuous, a primary hepatitis may be considered; purpura has been suspected when the petechiae are out- standing. Malaria often does complicate Oroya fever (vide infra) ; this diagnosis, as well as that of anemias of other origin, e. g. pernicious anemia, entail repeated blood examinations, during which the correct diagnosis usually becomes evident.'7 The positive diagnosis is made from a stained blood film when parasites are numerous. Difficulties are en- countered during the period before the anemia is marked, when parasites are not visible. At this time blood cul- tures are often positive and should always be made when bartonellosis is suspected.'8 Too often these simple procedures are neglected, chiefly from failure to entertain the possibility of barto- nella infection. No single item is more suggestive than the history of residence or passage within an endemic 17Arce, prior to 1900 (in Odriozola), stated that in Panama a condition known as "railroad febrile anemia" or "Panama fever" was indistinguishable clinically from Oroya fever. The author has not been able to identify "Panama fever," which is apparently not the same as the present-day "Panama six-day fever," a denguelike disease. 18 Hercelles (1935b) advises biopsy of a lymph node, where, he states, bartonellae may be found earlier than in the blood. zone. If, joined to this, fever, any one of the types of algia described, enlarged lymph nodes, and, above all, anemia are found, then bartonellosis should be suspected quite irrespective of other symptoms. The diagnosis of infections complicating Oroya fever follows different procedures. When it is malaria, the blood films should be revealing; quinine will act on the plasmodium, not on the bartonellae. In complicating infections with organisms of the typhoid group, the anemia improves and the polypnea decreases, while the spleen and liver become notably hypertrophied and the general state remains poor (Barton, 1914); blood cul- tures and agglutinations should be decisive. Prognosis The mortality in Oroya fever is about 40 percent, perhaps somewhat higher in the epidemics. Kikuth (1932) found values of 75 to 95 percent recorded in the literature. Jaramillo (1939) and Patifio (1940c) estimate the deaths in the Colombian epidemic at about 40 percent; 48 percent of the 33 patients studied by Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938) in the non-eruptive phase, died. The indications of a favorable outcome are a decrease in the fever, improvement of the general state, and amelioration of the anemia. The last is often preceded by a disappearance of the parasites and a change in the leucocyte formula (p. 254). Since such remissions may be temporary, a favorable prognosis should not be made too early. Parasites and anemia may both decrease, and yet the case may proceed to a fatal outcome after secondary infection. This is indicated by a worsening of the general state in contrast to the improvement in the signs of specific infection. If an abundant eruption of verrugas takes place, re- covery is the rule; in rare cases, the eruption is scanty and short-lived, and may be followed by a fatal relapse of Oroya fever (Odriozola, 1898). Pathological Anatomy The characteristic finding in Oroya fever is an ex- tremely distinctive cellular lesion which appears to be unique to this condition and is considered pathogno- monic (Harvard,, 1915). The discovery and first de- scription are due to R. P. Strong and E. E. Tyzzer (1915b). An amplified and illustrated account ap- peared in the Harvard (1915) "Report of the First Expedition to South America, 1913." The lesion is constituted by the intracytoplasmic de- velopment of t masses of bartonellae within the lining cells of the blood and lymph capillaries. This growth reaches an extreme degree, causes the cytoplasm to expand to many times the normal width, and then to bulge into the lumen of the vessel. Such distended cells are easily visible in stained sections with the low powers of the microscope. They resemble, at a hasty glance, nothing quite so much as the endothelial cells</page><page sequence="17">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 257 during the extreme phagocytosis following blockade of the reticulo-endothelial system (plate I, fig. 3) .19 The cells involved include vascular endothelium in the most varied sites in the body: lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow, spleen, kidney, adrenal, pancreas, testicle, and occasional cells in the heart and lungs (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937b), hypophysis (Mackehenie and Alzamora, 1939), intestinal villi, vasa vasorum. etc. The occurrence of such cells in the skin is of par- ticular interest. Aldana (1929) noted them in the dermis. Also they may be very superficial. Thus, in a typical case of Oroya fever with 'no verruga eruption, capillaries situated in the epidermis, entirely surrounded by cells of the basal pigmented layer, and accordingly situated at 50L or less from the surface, were observed by the author to be very heavily infected. Upon histo- logical examination, the dermal capillaries were found to be extremely numerous, and surrounding some such vessels situated in both the dermis and the epidermis were a few proliferated endothelial cells. Thus the picture in this area of skin strongly suggested incipient verruga formation, since there were present two of the features which we shall see (p. 264) are distinctive of the fully-developed verruga. Should a biting insect insert his proboscis in such an area, the mouth parts would apparently be exposed to very massive infection. The infected cells are those usually classified as phago- cytic endotheliumn; in addition heavy infection was noted in the capillaries of the cortical region of the kidneys. Within the cell, in the intense infections, the entire cyto- plasm may be occupied by the parasites. The distribu- tion usually is not regular, for bartonella tends to form rounded masses or clumps. These may measure 5,u in diameter and are composed of parasites which are rod- shaped or coccoid or indistinct. Often in the central portion of the mass the organisms appear granular and distinctly rod-shaped at the periphery.20 As many as a dozen clumps may be distinguishable, or the cytoplasm may appear completely full of organisms. In many cells both isolated and massed parasites are found to- gether. Within Kupifer cells of the liver there was less of a tendency to clumping, and the majority of heavily infected cells showed discrete organisms only (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937b).21 The nuclei are at 19 Microscopic study of the viscera is considerably facilitated by adequate staining of the micro-organisms. For this purpose, the technique recommended by Nicholson (1923) has been in- valuable. This procedure involves the use of Regaud's fixative, embedding in paraffin, and staining with Giemsa's fluid accord- ing to Wolbach's technique (Mallory, 1938). 20 It is thus not possible to confirm the report that bacillary forms of bartonella are never found in the tissues (Hercelles, 1936). 21 Aldana (1929) attributes cluster formation to the fact that the parasites originate from phagocyted red cells. However, clusters arise in tissue culture infected with bartonellae culti- vated on semi-solid medium which is almost erythrocyte-free (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937a). Also after four years of culture on semi-solid medium, the tendency of the organism to grow in clumps has not changed. times obscured and distorted by masses of parasites. The latter often appear to rest upon the nuclear mem- branes but have not been observed in distinctly intra- nuclear position. The endothelial lesion was observed by the author in both of two cases where death was attributable to barto- nellosis. In a third case parasites had almost disap- peared from the blood when the patient died with a concomitant Toxoplasma infection; distended endoth-e- lial cells were not observed (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937b). Aldana (1929) found extensive development in endothelium only when bartonellae were numerous in the blood, as well as a rough proportionality between 'the intensity of the erythrocytic and endothelial devel' opment. The capillaries were of normal appearance in two of his cases which died after disappearance of parasites. Other important but less distinctive lesions have also been reported involving particularly the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. The various pathological descrip- tions are somewhat discordant, which might have been anticipated from the apparently high incidence of sec- ondary infection. Weiss (1927a) indeed states that it is rare that a case of Carrion's disease reaches the autopsy table without a secondary infection to which death may be attributed, while Jimenez (1938) found the secondary lesions to predominate, and often to be the only ones demonstrable.22 In s6 far as the literature has permitted, the pathol- ogy described will be that found in pure bartonella infections. The lesions wlhich seem to be typical are: first, disseminated petechiae; and second, infarction in various organs. The body exhibits pallor; scattered peteclhiae may be found in the skin and conjunctivae, and icterus of the skin and sclerae is frequent. Lymph nodes.-The nodes, variously situated, are conspicuously enlarged and often reddish to pink in color-changes which constitute one of the most ap- parent abnormalities in Oroya fever. Superficial groups (inguinal, axillary, retro-auricular regions, etc.) as well as the intra-abdominal chains have this appearance. Usually several nodes of a single group are involved, may reach 28 mm. in length, and upon section appear hemorrhagic. Microscopically, the specific lesion, pre- viously described (p. 256) and consisting of swollen endothelial cells, is prominent and attracts attention at once (Harvard, 1915). Vascular obliteration followed by infarction has been reported (Tamayo, 1899b; Her- celles, 1935b). The process would appear to be similar to that occurring in the spleen and to follow upon vascular occlusion by the endothelium (Harvard, 1915). The muscles appear only slightly paler than normal (Harvard, 1915). Upon cutting through to the ab- dominal cavity, there is no evidence of peritonitis. '2 In other series of cases, secondary infection has becn infre- quent (p. 253).</page><page sequence="18">258 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Spleen.-Often normal ii! size (Tamayo, 1899b), the organ may be enlarged to 17.7 by 10.1 by 7.6 cm. (Har- vard, 1915).23 In a case reported by Strong, Tyzzer, et al., and in one of the cases seenl by Dr. Pinkerton and the author,24 lesions grossly resembling infarcts were present. They were wider at the periphery of the or- gan than toward the center. Not distinctly wedge- shaped on section and yellowish-white or gray in color, they reached 15 mm. or more at the surface and ex- tended 1 cm. into the organ. In sections bartonellae are found in the lining cells of the sinuses and of the capillaries. Giant cells with single multilobed nuclei, of the megakaryocyte type, are rare, scattered, and contain ingested red cells. Strong, Tyzzer et al. (1915) noted frequent venous thromboses and numerous infarctions. At the edges congestion was marked, and leucocytes migrated into the necrotic tissue where, at places, there were deposits of fibrin. Erythrophagocytosis was conspicuous. Pigment of two types was encountered both here and in the liver (vide infra). In the case seen by the author the quantity of pigment was surprisingly small. The report by Nicolle (1898) of acid-fast bacilli and caseation was appar- ently due to tubercular infection of the spleen. Liver.-Hepatomegaly sometimes occurs, but the liver has appeared otherwise normal even when conspicuous microscopic lesions were present. The Kupifer cells contain erythrocytes, leucocytes, numerous bartonellae whiclh tend less to form clumps than elsewlhere, and pig- ment. The latter is not extremely abundant. Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) noted two kinds, a yellow-brown variety which did not give the iron reaction and crvstals identified as hematoidin. Extensive areas of necrosis centering about the he- patic vein were found by Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915). They were composed of three zones: in the center the hepatic cells were granular, in the intermediate portion many liver cells were hyaline and stained strongly with eosin, while others contained numerous fat vacuoles. At the periphery of the lesion the Kupifer cells were actively phagocytic. Aldana (1929) also reports zones of necrosis in the liver, and Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938) noted degeneration about the central veins.25 Bonie marrow.-Odriozola as early as 1898 observed energetic hematopoiesis in the marrow. This has been generally confirmed. Carvallo (1911) noted numerous normoblasts which Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) found increased in number; Pinkerton (1940) reports megalo- blastic hyperplasia. 23 Enlargement due to malaria may be seen in Oroya fever cases. 24 The gross findings in these cases have not been published; histological studies of the same tissues appeared in 1937 (Pinker- ton and Weinman, 1937b). 25 Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen has been described by Mackehenie (1930b; 1932a). Weiss (1927a), in a careful study of a case with the erythro- cytes below 2,000,000, found no vicariant erythropoiesis; Macke- henie's observation has not been generally confirmed. Kidneys.-According to Aldana (1929), small in- farcts may follow capillary thrombosis, taking place in contact with the swollen endothelial cells. Weiss (1927a) describes desquamation of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules and of Bowman's capsule; the excretory tubes contained fibrinous cylinders and des- quamated cells. His patient was apparently a chronic alcoholic who had previously suffered from typhus and malaria. The other abdominal viscera do not present note- worthy changes of regular occurrence. In one case, Strong and Tyzzer (1915b) found extensive ulcera- tions of the colon; no amoebae were encountered; the lesions were considered to result from occlusion of neighboring blood vessels by parasitized endothelial cells. Thoracic viscera.-The heart, in a case observed by Dr. Pinkerton and the author, showed numerous pete- chiae which did not extend into the depth of the muscle; the pericardium contained an abundant amount of non- hemorrhagic yellow-green fluid. The valves have usu- ally been found normal; Hercelles (1936), however, frequently finds lesions of the aortic sigmoids which he states may lead to ulceration. Lungs.-In Strong and Tyzzer's case (1915b) the lungs were well spotted with petechiae; Pinkerton and the author found in one patient pinkish patches scat- tered over the surface and a few small areas of hemor- rhage in the organ. The pleurae have been found to be spotted with petechiae; the pleural contents are not noteworthy. The thymus was not found in our 20- year-old patient. Nervous system.-Mackehenie and Alzamora (1939), in periods of the disease not always specified, describe lesions of the nervous system which are attributed to bartonella for reasons not always evident. These le- sions were vascular in origin and involved the pneumo- gastric nerve, the sympathetic ganglia, and, in the central nervous system, the hypophysis and internal capsule. Pathogentesis "The essential criterion of anemia due to increased blood destruction is an increase of the hemoglobin- derived pigments in the plasma and stools with corre- sponding evidence of increased bone marrow activity in the peripheral blood. . . . Bilirubin . . . is . . . known to be a breakdown product of hemoglobin." (Castle and Minot, 1936.) In Oroya fever, these conditions are fulfilled in the majority of cases (pp. 255 if.), and it has generally been concluded that blood destruction is the fundamental cause of the anemia (Barton, 1909; Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915; Aldana, 1929; Fairley, 1932; Pittaluga, 1938; Weiss, 1933; Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). The evidence cited, it will be noted, is indirect, and the mechanism producing the blood loss is, despite in- tensive investigation, still quitXe obscure. Barton (1909) supposed that the bartonellae generated hemolytic sub- stances; these have not been demonstrated. Notably,</page><page sequence="19">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 259 in cultures, there is not the slightest evidence of erythro- cytolysis. In fact, no lytic substances whatever have been demonstrated, either in vivo or in vitro (pp. 255 and 272). Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) posited a double mechanism: destruction of parasitized red cells by direct action, and erythrophagocytosis provoked by a toxic substance. Direct action of the bartonellae on red cells was also mentioned by Pittaluga (1938) to explain the anemia of Oroya fever as well as those caused by certain species of Haemobartonella. The mechanism suggested in- volved penetration of the erythrocyte by the parasite through dissolution of the lipoid envelope of the cell; this would be followed by hemolysis. But, we have seen that in Oroya fever there is neither hemoglobi- nemia nor hemoglobinuria.26 Furthermore, it would be difficult to explain the initial decrease in the red count before parasites are seen on the erythrocytes. Hurtado, Pons, and Merino (1938), on the contrary, feel that red cell parasitism is not the fundamental mechanism. They point out that a decrease in the parasite count does not necessarily mean a parallel decrease in the red count: thus the parasitized cells numbered 3,500,000 per mm.3 on one occasion; two days later, only 100,000; in the same period the total red count had decreased only from 4,040,000 to 3,590,000. From this they con- clude that parasitization does not entail prompt de- struction. No demonstration of the actual method of destruction was made. Aldana (1929) appears to credit erythrophagocytosis as the primary factor, while Weiss (1933) believes three mechanisms are in play: erythrophagocytosis, other means of red cell destruction, and a toxin, not demon- strated, supposed to act on the bone marrow. Arce (1913c) speaks of megaloblastic degeneration of the bone marrow and considers defective erythropoiesis the primary cause. Monge (1925b), likewise, appar- ently impressed by the failure to demonstrate hemolysis, or hemorrhage sufficient to explain the anemia, drew the same conclusion, and in this he is followed by Fox (1935). This view is very one-sided and does not apply to the typical cases in which bone marrow activity is conspicuous. Poor hematopoiesis sometimes does occur, but it is always a secondary cause of the anemia, subsidiary to the blood destruction (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). Such cases may manifest, in addition to the anemia, leucopenia with a decrease in the polymorpho- nuclear leucocytes and a low platelet count (Manrique and Rocha, 1937). They are difficult to explain, and the following possibilities have been involved: (a) in- hibition of the bone marrow by bartonella or complicat- ing bacteria; (b) lack of iron due to loss or difficulty of 26 It should be emphasized that the diseases provoked by Bartonella and Haemobartonella differ in many particulars. Dr. Pittaluga's suggestion would appear to apply much more adequately to the anemia caused by Haemobartonella muiris. utilization; (c) possible difficulty of liberation of a "hematinic" factor (Hurtado, Pons, and Merino, 1938). It is very probably only after the mechanism of blood destruction is elucidated that another fundamental problem can be explained: Why does Oroya fever de- velop in certain persons, while others present only the more innocuous verruga peruana or the harmless asymptomatic infection? Kuczynski (1937b) believes that Oroya fever is more likely to develop in persons with a low standard of living because of (a) poor nutri- tion or (b) intestinal infections. The blood invasion, he likewise believes, is due to a lowering of natural immunity, due in turn to a similar lowering in the general metabolism. These views are extremely inter- esting; it is to be hoped that some day adequate evidence to support them will be produced. Infarctions.-These are thought to follow upon vas- cular thrombosis taking place about the swollen endo- thelial cells (Harvard, 1915). The generalized distri- bution of such infected cells explains the varied sites of the infarcts. Hercelles (1936) reports lymphopenia in the early stages of Oroya fever; this, he states, is caused by a reduction in the number of follicles follow- ing follicular capillaritis. Hepatic central necroses.-Attributed to a toxin, not yet isolated, as well in man (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915) as in monkeys (Noguchi, 1927b), another ex- planation of these lesions is available from the data presented by Rich (1930). This author, with a wealth of detail, has pointed out that oxygen lack will lead to hepatic lesions which consistently and preferentially in- volve the liver cells surrounding the central veins. These lesions could be produced experimentally by any of several procedures causing oxygen deprivation, and led to atrophy, or, if the anoxemia was sufficiently marked, to necrosis. In human liver material obtained from cases of pernicious anemia and various secondary anemias, entirely similar appearances were obtained. Dr. Rich has informed the author (1941) that subse- quent investigations on anoxemia have consistently given results like those obtained above. It would seem probable from the foregoing that the anemia of Oroya fever, by the same mechanism, would lead to analogous central hepatic lesions. Experimental Oroya Fever Human Oroya fever has been reproduced experi- mentally only once to the author's knowledge; this is the celebrated case of Carrion, which has been discussed in detail (p. 248). No animal is completely satisfac- tory for this purpose. In monkeys, with great irregu- larity, conditions resembling Oroya fever may occa- sionally be produced. Battistini (1925a), utilizing a Macacus rhesus,27 ob- tained marked anemia with some visible red cell para- 27 Although Macaca mulatta is at present considered to be the correct designation of this animal, M. rhiesuts will be used when so given in the original.</page><page sequence="20">260 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY sites. The animal had received an intravenous inocu- lation of human blood containing both bartonellae in great numbers and a pneumococcus. Twenty-four days after inoculation death occurred, apparently from the pulmonary tuberculosis found at autopsy. This case is of particular interest, for it is one of the very few in which human Oroya fever blood, no matter how heavily infected, has produced disease in animals. After intravenous injection of cultures in the same species, Noguchi and Battistini (1926) noted a few parasites in the blood films; after inoculation of the skin with cultures, Noguchi (1927a) at times observed numerous parasites and marked anemia; demonstration of bartonellae was feasible only when the blood titre, determined by culture, was greater than 1: 1000 (1926b). Mayer and Kikuth (1927) reported a notable infec- tion with marked anemia in two monkeys. The heav- iest was in a splenectomized "Hundsaffe" (= ?Cynopi- thecus), inoculated first with monkey lymph node tissue, with negative local results; then five weeks later, with blood, by an unspecified route, from a monkey with a verruga eruption and infected with piroplasma. Six days after receiving the blood, bartonellae were ob- served; two days later the infection was massive and the anemia severe; death occurred the ninth day after inoculation. Lymph nodes and spleen were examined in sections and in films; no distended endothelial cells were found. The blood of this animal did not produce Oroya fever in other monkeys. The second monkey, with heavy infection, was also a "Hundsaffe." Three other animals, a M. rhesus, a Java monkey (sp.?), and a Mangabey (sp. ?), showed only a few blood para- sites; in at least two this followed the injection of monkey verruga tissue into the skin. Four of these five animals were splenectomized; however, in many other splenectomized monkeys no bartonellae were seen. Noguchi (1928e) likewise obtained no uniform effect from splenectomy. Weinman and Pinkerton inoculated 20 Macaccus rhe- sus monkeys with a variety of material: cultures, tissue cultures, infected human blood, infected human lymph nodes, and verruga tissue, by a variety of routes: intra- cutaneously, subcutaneously, intravenously, and into the lymph nodes. In only one animal was a condition resembling Oroya fever produced (1937a). This mon- key had been splenectomized, and the blood had been examined subsequently at frequent intervals; no spon- taneous infection with erythrocytic parasites (Haemo- bartonella, Grahamella, etc.), was detected. 'After two months of observation, the animal then received 2 cc. of heavily infected human blood intravenously, and a small amount in the inguinal lymph nodes. At this time the erythrocyte count was 6,430,000, and the hemoglobin 12.8 grams. The following day sterile semi-solid me- dium was injected intracutaneously in the eyebrow region and subcutaneously in the umbilical area. Posi- tive blood cultures were obtained on the sixth and twen- tieth days after inoculation. On six occasions in the two weeks following the blood injection, blood films were negative for bartonellae. During this period the temperature did not rise above 1030 F., and one morn- ing was below 980 F. At the end of the same period the red count was 5,040,000, and the hemoglobin 10 gm. Twenty-five days after the blood inoculation the animal was moribund. The hemoglobin was only 5.8 gm. and the blood films showed 7 percent of the red cells infected with from one to twelve bartonellae. The parasites were predominatingly rod-shaped, and on the cells they frequently occurred grouped together as in a sheaf. The post-mortem examination revealed nu- merous tubercles of the right lung; there was no gener- alized enlargement of the lymph nodes. In sections of the viscera no distended endothelial cells were found. No verruga developed in the eyebrow region where ster- ile semi-solid medium had been injected; although the bartonellae were circulating in the blood, they appar- ently did not colonize at this point. Pathology.-The lesions found in non-eruptive bar- tonellosis in the monkey have been described by No- guchi, who, from his very abundant monkey material, assembled five fatal cases which had presented a clinical picture resembling Oroya fever, and in which no evi- dence of tuberculosis was found (1927b). The lymph nodes showed a generalized hypertrophy and conges- tion, varying in color between pink, red, and bluish red. The endothelial cells appeared increased in numbers and contained green pigment. Bartonellae were seen in a few cells in a smnall number of animals; apparently the typical human lesion was not reproduced. The spleen was enlarged, bluish red, firm, and with indistinct follicles. Scattered, small, grayish red in- farctions were noted in every case. Microscopically, many veins were found occluded; leucocytes had in- filtrated into the periphery of the infarcts. The macro- phages frequently contained erythrocytes and yellow- brown pigment which could also be found free. Here again no swollen endothelial cells such as occur in man were observed. The liver was pale and in many cases enlarged. Areas of necrosis, centering about the he- patic veins and occasionally bordered by phagocytic macrophages, were seen in sections. Around the portal veins the endothelial cells were said to have proliferated. Yellow or brown pigment was observed in the Kupffer cells and endothelial phagocytes. Bartonellae were found in only a few cells in two of the five cases. To summarize, the reproduction in animals of the essential features of Oroya fever has not yet been ac- complished. Notably, the pathognomonic endothelial lesion is lacking, owing possibly to the relatively scanty blood infection. The best results have been obtained with monkeys. However, even the most satisfactory outcome is unpredictable. This circumstance has ob- structed many avenues of investigation, notably experi- ments concerning therapeutics.

VERRUGA PERUANA Definition Verruga peruana is a form of human bartonellosis manifested by an eruption of papular and deep nodular elements. The superficial verrugas, found on any part of the body surface, are typically a vivid red color, and somewhat resemble warts-hence their name. Exam- ined histologicdlly, individual verrugas contain Bar- tonella bacilliformis and present two other distinctive features: abundant newly-formed blood vessels and very numerous proliferated endothelial cells. The erup- tion is of limited duration and the resultant mortality low. The Peruvian authors generally distinguish three types of lesions, classified according to size and situa- tion. The miliary lesion is small, usually less than one centimeter at the base, superficial, and always raised above the level of the neighboring skin. Nodular ver- rugas reach several centimeters in length and are situ- ated in the deeper layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Certain of these develop toward the surface and frequently erode the skin; they are then referred to as mulaire 28 verrugas. In the same patient all three types may be found. Period of Eruption The initial lesion and its evolution.-Visible in the miliary type of eruption, the primary lesion frequently appears upon an area of oedematous skin from which paresthetic symptoms (pricking, itching, etc.) origi- nate. At first a petechia (Odriozola, 1898), it may dlso appear as a macule, circular in outline and pink in color. The lesion gradually increases in size, be- comes bright scarlet, and has a smooth and polished surface; at this stage the color does not disappear on pressure (Monge, 1912a). Growth continues, the ele- ment becomes hemispherical, and at maximum de- velopment measures one centimeter more or less at the base. Young lesions at times ma'y develop in other ways. A sudaminous variety is constituted by small clear vesicles which may be umbilicated; the pustulous- is similar, but the vesicles are cloudy; still another type is dull white and has a horny appearance. All usually come to have the same appearance as they de- velop; the horny variety more than the others retains its original appearance. If the papules are ruptured when small, they may crust over and disappear (Car- rion, 1886). - Varieties of the eruption: the miliary eruption.- This often begins on the anterior aspect of the lower portion of the legs and then progresses, with successive crops of verrugas, to a wider dissemination. A sym- 28 So-called from a resemblance to verrugalike lesions in mules metrical disposition has been noted particularly when the elements are profuse (Odriozola, 1898; Fox, 1935). When generalized, verrugas occur on covered and ex- posed portions alike. The areas of predilection are the limbs and the face (Odriozola, 1898). They are rela- tively rare on the trunk, genitalia, and scalp. On the palms and soles, the lesions may be typical but are fre- quently black, and when examined show signs of old hemorrhage (Dounon, 1871). In addition to this gen- eralized form, localized eruptions occur, and in either the verrugas may be discrete or confluent. The latter type, when situated on the face, may strongly resemble leprosy (Hercelles, 1936). The mature miliary verruga appears about the size and color of a cranberry, varying thus from vivid red to purple. Smaller forms are sessile; the larger tend to be pediculated. The covering skin is usually shiny and tense; when intact it merges gradually with the surrounding epidermis; if not, a collarette of skin sur- rounds the base. Verrugas are firm to the touch and provoke no painful sensation either spontaneously or, usually, on palpation. Since the eruption takes place in successive stages, elements at all periods of development and regression are juxtaposed. Miliary verrugas may also be situated on the mucosae. In a case of profuse eruption seen by the author, papules entirely analogous to these on the body occurred on the tongue and were very numerous on the roof of the mouth, where they later became confluent. Odriozola observed verrugas on the conjunctiva, where they were usually single, flat, and accompanied by some conjunctivitis; and also on the nasal mucosae, soft palate, and tonsils. After full development has been reached, there is a stationary period, then regression commences. The epidermis over the verruga exfoliates, sometimes to be followed by ulceration and hemorrhage, the color pales, and the verruga shrinks progressively. Occasionally it becomes horny, and then decreases slowly, finally falling off as a thick crust. Once having disappeared, a small dark spot may persist for a time, but there is no scar formation in uncomplicated cases (Odriozola, 1898). Suppuration and gangrene sometimes occur during re- gression; these may be followed by permanent cicatrices (Escomel, 1902). Nodular and mulaire verrugas.-These larger ele- ments are. less numerous than the miliary verrugas. At first perceptible upon palpation as well-limited, sub- cutaneous, small, single or multiple hard nodules, which are mobile and sensitive to pressure (Odriozola, 1898), they tend, as they grow, to adhere to the skin, which becomes elevated and rosy or bluish. At this point the nodule measures one to several centimeters. It may then regress or grow to form the mulaire lesion. As it increases in size, the covering skin becomes raised, purple, thinned, and shiny. Finally, the red tumor pierces the violet skin, at which time there may be some local hemorrhage. The tumor itself has a red, irregular surface, and may be seated upon either a broad or a</page><page sequence="22">262 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY constricted base. In the pediculated forms more or less extensive gangrene may occur, to be followed by spon- taneous elimination, and sometimes hemorrhage and suppuration (Odriozola, 1898). If the mulaire ver- rugas do not fall as a unit after gangrene of the base, or suppurate as a result of secondary infection, they regress in a manner similar to, but more slowly than, the smaller verrugas. Scar formation, however, is the rule; the cicatrix is white and surrounded by a pig- mented zone (Odriozola, 1898). Duration.-The eruption persists from one month to two years (Odriozola, 1898). Abundant generalized eruptions tend to have a shorter total life; the mulaire verrugas last longer than the miliary. "Internal verrugas," supposedly situated in the vis- cera, have been often reported, particularly by the older authors. Arce (1931) well points out, however, that histological proof of their nature is lacking. While it seems not impossible that verrugas may occur on the gastro-intestinal and other mucosae, they have also been reported in the parenchyma of almost all the in- ternal organs.29 There is no doubt that other lesions have been mistaken for internal verrugas; thus in the spleen and liver they proved to be miliary tubercules, while a cardiac "verruga" was a cystic structure, prob- ably a cysticercus (Harvard, 1915). Two recent reports of internal verrugas, while not demonstrative, are particularly interesting. Gonz'alez Olaechea (1933b) observed a case of pleuritis in a verruga patient. Aspirated pleuritic fluid contained monocytes with bartonellae and red blood cells, and gave positive bartonella cultures (Mackehenie, Coro- nado, and Jimenez, 1933). Although pleural hemor- rhage might account for all the observed facts, it was supposed, but not demonstrated, that verrugas were present on the pleurae. Delgado (1935) observed petechiae and small red tumors in the bladder of about 10 percent of verruga patients. These persisted about as long as some cutaneous elements, usually provoked no symptoms, but occasionally caused a variable degree of hematuria. No histological examination was re- ported. Other signs and symptoms.-Pains and fever, per- sisting from the invasion period, occur intermittently. The temperature may ascend at the inception of the eruption, and again with each new crop of verrugas, but at other times is usually slight or absent. Occa- sionally, during growth of the mulaire lesion, there is persistent pyrexia (Odriozola, 1898). Spleen and liver are of normal size (Harvard, 1915). The lymph nodes may be enlarged (Arce, 1931), but apparently not with the regularity seen in Oroya fever. Dounon (1871) states that menstruation is frequently painful during the eruption, and often suppressed. Unexpected symptoms have been reported to result 29See for example Campodonico (1895; 1908; also in Odrio- zola, p. 168). from certain peculiar sites of the eruption. Odriozola has described verrugas in the nasal fossae, where breathing may be impeded and epistaxis may result; in the mouth and in the soft palate, with resultant dys- phagia; and on the vocal cords, producing dysphonia. Neurological manifestations of the most varied sorts have been described in Carrion's disease, chiefly in ver- ruga cases (Monge and Mackehenie, 1933a), but con- vincing anatomical evidence that the causative lesions were produced by bartonella is lacking. The literature contains cases of anterior poliomyelitis attributed to bartonella. These were reviewed by Mendez and Quintana (1940), who concluded that the described lesions are inadequate to incriminate bartonella as a. direct cause. Laboratory examinations: the blood.-Usually a moderate anemia of about 3,000,000 is found at the height of the eruption (Arce, 1931). Parasites are not seen on the erythrocytes save in very rare instances. Then they usually are few and disappear rapidly. Yet cultural methods prove bartonellae to be present in the blood in most cases. The total white count is ap- parently not significantly changed; the eosinophiles (Monge, 1912b) and monocytes (Harvard, 1915) are sometimes increased. The abrupt change in the form- ula seen at the end of Oroya fever has been discussed (p. 255). The van den Bergh reaction was negative in the serum (Guzman Barron, 1926). Cholesterine values varied, being normal or above after a severe anemia, but low, averaging 0.96 gm. per liter, in the contrary case (Guzm'an Barron, 1931). Arce (1931) reported notably increased resistance of the red cells to saline hemolysis. No heterohemolysins were found in four verruga sera by Biffi (1903), nor autohemolysins, either the warm or the cold varieties, in three cases of Guz- man Barron (1926). The last author reported a slight degree of auto-agglutination. The urine contains no urobilin, but may have some albumin during febrile periods (Pimentel, 1913). Escomel (1940) obtained cultures, apparently from the passed urine, of an organism which he considered to be bartonella; however, the identification seems in- complete. Duration and evolution.-The life of the eruption averages four to six months; it may be much shorter, particularly when constituted by a rapidly generalized eruption, or it may last more than two years; the mu- laire persists longer than the miliary verruga (Odrio- zola, 1898). Convalescence, usually rapid, may lag and be attended by various algias and irregular fevers (Odriozola, 1898). This favorable development is the rule, but the erup- tion may pale and disappear before reaching maximum development, and in turn may be followed by Oroya fever (Odriozola, 1898). This evolution is stated to be more common in cases of secondary infection (Bar-</page><page sequence="23">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 263 ton, 1914; Rebagliati, 1940). Also, nodules may be. come purulent in cases of septicemia; Tamayo an( Gastiaburuf (1906a) noted pus formation and isolate( from the blood and from the verrugas a typhoidlike or. ganism. Weiss (1927a) observed an eruption evolv. ing concurrently with miliary tuberculosis; the nodule. were few and pallid, contrasting strongly with th( florid eruption which, he states, is seen in robusl persons. Second attacks.-Dual and even multiple recurrence. of verruga do occur, although a single episode is th( usual history elicited. Hurtado (1939) investigate( this problem in a town in the endemic zone. Ninety- five percent of the patients giving a history of verruga stated that the eruption had appeared before their third year of age. Six individuals reported more than on( attack; and one, six different attacks. Whether these repeated eruptions represent relapses or reinfection is not known. Mackehenie (1934), how- ever, gives an account of a patient who had three erup- tions in 20 months. The third attack, it was stated could not be due to reinfection, since the subject hac left the endemic zone.30 Diagnosis A generalized, well-developed verruga eruption ha, an extremely distinctive appearance. Howard Fox (1935) states: "The eruption as a whole is unique and unlike any disorder of the skin with which I am fa- miliar," and Manson-Bahr (1936) finds that "it is hardly likely to be mistaken for any other disease." The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the etiological agent within the lesions. This may be made in films, but sections will also show the very characteristic histology. Cultures from the blood are often positive; when made from the lesions, contamina- tion occurs in about 80 percent of the cases (Aldana, 1929) .31 Individual elements are said to resemble granuloma pyogenicum or molluscum contagiosum (Fox, 1935) and angiomata (Manson-Bahr, 1936), while the erup- tion as a whole may appear somewhat like secondary yaws, multiple warts, molluscum contagiosum, or multi- ple fatty tumors (Dercum's disease) (Manson-Bahr, 1936). Marschall (1938) notes a clinical and patho- logical similarity to the skin lesion of epidemic dropsy; blood vessels are somewhat more numerous in the latter condition. With the aid of the methods given above, the correct diagnosis should be possible. In certain cases of "angiofibroma cutis circum- scriptum contagiosum," also referred to as Bassewitz's tumors, the differential diagnosis has not been made. 30 Additional details, p. 268. 31 Battistini (1928) obtained pure cultures from verrugas by injecting a rabbit intratesticularly with the emulsified tissue. Seven to nine days later the testicle was removed, fragmented, and placed in suitable media. Bassewitz described the condition in 1906, noted the similarity to verruga, but considered it to be distinct for mrany reasons, only one of which seems particularly weighty today: the apparent absence of the initial fever and pseudorheumatoid symptoms. Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) reviewed the available literature, called attention to the striking histological resemblance of the two conditions, and did not consider it proved that they were distinct entities. Aschoff (1937) believes that a definite differentiation can be made by finding, "inclusions" in the vessels of verruga. We shall see that this may not always be sufficient. He compares Bassewitz's tumors to the more cosmo- politan telangiectatic granuloma, which he believes is probably an infectious disease, and states that histologi- cally the two conditions almost completely resemble each other. Rocha-Lima, who has had extensive experience with both verruga and Bassewitz's tumors, has published some most interesting observations. One concerned a case originating in Honduras, and was referred to him by Weiss, who considered it to be verruga peruana (1933). Rocha-Lima (1925; 1927) states that it was scarcely distinguishable from verruga by the clinical data or macroscopic and microscopic appearance. No- tably, in angioblasts intracellular bodies were encoun- tered which he states were indistinguishable from those seen in known verruga cases. However, he concluded that it was not verruga, chiefly because of minute histo- logical differences: the vessels appeared more numer- ous, were wider, had thinner walls, and oedematous con- nective tissue was lacking (1925). It should be noted that Rocha-Lima himself states that known verrugas may vary from the type appearance (1927). It is un- fortunate that this case was inconclusive; cultural methods and animal inoctlations might have been de- cisive. A second case occurred in a patient from Mana- capuru, Brazil.32 It was analogous to the first save that "inclusions" were lacking, possibly, as Rocha-Lima suggests, owing to failure to stain after formalin fixa- tion. Jantzen (1930) reported still another case in a Salvadorian, resident in Honduras; Nauck (in Jant- zen) examined the tissues and could demonstrate no inclusions.33 As may be seen, the true nature of Bassewitz's tu- mors is not yet determined. Possibly more than one entity has been included in this term. Rocha-Lima more recently (1932) refers to his two cases as pseudo- verrugas, and states that the subject is still obscure and in urgent need of fturther investigation. With this view the present author is in thorough agreement, for it 32 In Amazonas, a few miles west of Manaos. 33 Very recently Garcia Caballero and Mayoral (1942) ex- amined nodules obtained from Chilean patients with the clinical diagnosis of von Recklinghausen's disease. The structure of the nodules did not confirm this diagnosis, but suggested ver- ruga peruana.</page><page sequence="24">264 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY would seem that with the use of available methods the problem should be capable of solution. Prognosis Verruga is a mild syndrome witlh low miiortality. Ortega (1939) observed no deaths at all in the erup- tive type of bartonellosis during the Colombian epi- demic, whereas the total death rate was 40 percent (Patifio, 1940c). The high mortality which has been reported from "verruga" includes cases of both Oroya fever and those complicated by secondary infection. Apparently, simple true verruga is very rarely fatal. The individual prognosis, Odriozola believes (1898), should be reserved. It is favorable when the eruption is generalized, develops fully, and regresses slowly while the general condition improves. If it be limited, evolve poorly, retrocede rapidly while the general con- dition remains poor, then it may either last for a long time or he followed by Oroya fever. Pathological Anatomy Three histological findings typify the verruga: nu- merous new-formed, small-caliber blood vessels, prolif- erated endothelial cells, and bartonellae (pl. I, fig. 4). Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) have described the lesion histologically as "a special form of granuloma charac- terized in the early stages by the formation of new blood vessels in cedematous connective tissue, and by marked proliferation of the angioblastic cells forming masses or islands of closely-packed cells, by the invasion of connective tissue by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and leukocytes, and as the lesion progresses, by the forma- tion of fibroblasts and the deposition of collagen fibrils." Marked vascularization of the tissue was noted in the very early studies (Renaud, 1871). The characteristic cells were described, illustrated, and referred to by Escomel in 1902 as "verrucous cells." Rocha-Lima (1913) and Mayer, Rocha-Lima, and Werner (1913a) published a description, which insofar as the anatomical details are concerned, is the account accepted today. They found Escomel's verruga cells, considered them to be of endothelial origin, and termed them angioblasts. Within the angioblasts they described intracytoplasmic inclusions; bartonellae were not reported. Noguchi and Battistini (1926) and Noguchi (1926b; 1927a; 1927b) described bartonellae as occurring with regularity in the numerous verrugas produced experi- mentally in monkeys.34 Subsequent investigators did not secure identical results in human or monkey lesions. However, the confirmation of these findings of Noguchi in a series of nodules of both monkey and human origin was obtained by the 1937 Harvard Expedition to Peru. In man and in the monkey the lesions are very simi- lar (Cole, 1913; Harvard, 1915). The following de- scription is based on material of both origins, the hu- man verruga being regarded as the type. 34 In 1925 Mackehenie and Weiss reported bartonellae in the endothelium of an experimentally produced monkey verruga. The epidermis, in the developed verruga, is thinned over the lesion, of normal thickness at the sides (Cole, 1913). It may be cedematous, and may contain small intra- and extracellular vesicles (Cole, 1913), or small abscesses (Mackehenie, 1938a), and a variable degree of cellular infiltration (Cole, 1913; Riordan, 1935). Letulle (1898) found large amounts of intracellular glycogen. In the horny variety, the epidermis is thick- ened (Escomel, 1902). The papillae are sometimes broadened and elongated (Riordan, 1935), and Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1914) observed portions of cornified epidermis deep within the verruga proper surrounded by giant cells. Beneath, the verruga develops in the dermis or in the subcutaneous tissue, or in both. It is occasionally subdivided by connective tissue into separate lobules (Escomel, 1902). The numerous new-formed vessels are conspicuous and often very small. Rocha-Lima (1913) noted variation in their orientation in regard to the surface. The vessel wall is often only one cell thick; these cells may be in mitosis and may vary in size, number, and protoplasmic content with the size of the vessel (Rocha-Lima, 1913). At the periphery of the lesion the vessels are sometimes dilated, giving a cavernous appearance to this region (Mayer, Rocha- Lima, and Werner, 1913a). In the vicinity of the vessels, areas of proliferated angioblasts form compact masses visible with the low power of the microscope. Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) describe their formation as a continuous outgrowth of the vascular endothelium. The most prominent feature of these cells is the large, oval, pale nucleus which is often notched or indented; the chromatin is scanty and usually contained in two or three large masses. In Regaud-Giemsa sections both nucleus and cytoplasm stain blue. The latter surrounds the nucleus with a narrow rim, save where it extends into processes, usu- ally two in number and at opposite extremities. These processes, according to Rocha-Lima (1913), connect both with similar processes of other cells and with the vessel walls. Vessels and angioblasts lie in connective tissue which shows a certain amount of cedema (Rocha-Lima, 1913; Harvard, 1915); they are surrounded by an infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, some plasma cells, isolated mast cells, a variable number of poly- morphonuclears (Rocha-Lima, 1913), and extra vascu- lar red cells. The monocytes present are inferentially related to the angioblasts by Rocha-Lima, who describes a series of transitions between the two. Not infre- quently, scattered, dense collections of polymorphonu- clears suggesting abscess formation occur. In monkey nodules a greater proportion of the infiltrate is con- stituted by polymorphonuclears than in man. Some elastic fibers may occur (Rocha-Lima, 1913), but they are not constant (Harvard, 1915). In the older lesions the connective tissue is more</page><page sequence="25">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 265 abundant (Harvard, 1915). There is no essential dif- ference between the cutaneous and the subcutaneous lesions (Mayer, Rocha-Lima, and Werner, 1913a), but the mulaire type may be without epithelium. Also it contains purulent foci due to secondary infection (Escomel, 1902)- perhaps more often than the other varieties. The bartonellae are conspicuous, bright red, bacillary or granular structures when seen in sections stained by the Regaud-Giemsa method. Utilizing this technique, Dr., Pinkerton and the author (1937b) demonstrated bartonellae with regularity in each of ten human nodules removed from seven patients, and in numerous monkey verrugas. They are situated in the neighborhood of the vessels and proliferated endothelial cells, and usually occur in groups. Some definitely lie within the cyto- plasm of the angioblasts; others appear to be extra- cellular, but may perhaps lie within the cell processes. The formation of rounded masses, the situation within the lining cells of vessels, and the distention of cells are far less frequent than in Oroya fever. In sections and perhaps more in films, some intracellular collections were not distinctly rod-shaped but appeared as granu- lar masses, and then resembled strikingly the descrip- tion of the chlamydozoalike inclusions of Mayer, Rocha- Lima, and Werner.85 Within the lesions, small, purulent foci are frequently observed. This is apparently an independent process due to secondary infection, since about 80 percent of cultures made from verrugas show contaminating or- ganisms (Aldana, 1929). Groot, Mayoral, and Mar- tinez (1941) have isolated actinomyces, staphylococcus, and streptococcus from the lesions. Bacterium peru- vianum, described by Noguchi (1928a) in human ver- ruga nodules, is of particular interest, for in films or sections it is difficult to distinguish from Bartonella bacilliformis. The distinction may easily be made by cultural methods, since B. peruvianum grows rapidly and readily on ordinary culture media. The acid-fast bacilli which have been reported in various instances (Letulle, 1898; Galli-Valerio,- 1911; Darling, 1911) are, as Darling has stated,' very probably tubercle bacilli; certain of the giant cell formations probably recognize the same cause. In the apparently normal skin of a case of Oroya fever with no eruption, the author noted an appearance strongly suggesting the development of a verruga. Capillaries heavily infected with bartonellae were nu- merous in the dermis, the massive infection of endo- 85 These authors describe three types of intracytoplasmic in- clusion: (1) small, round, slightly granular, red-violet disks, measuring 1st to 1.5ju; (2) similar structures but larger and more granular; (3) large, rounded or irregular brick-red masses. The material was Giemsa-stained and apparently fixed in Giemsa's (= Schaudinn's) fluid. These "inclusions" are prob- ably all bart6nellae, in either small or large collections, at' some stage of development or regression. Rocha-Lima (1932) and Kikuth (1935) in more recent publications appear to incline to this view; notably, no other origin is claimed for them. thelial cells with parasites distributed in rounded masses being characteristic of Oroya fever. In addition, the number of capillaries was abnormally large, and endo- thelial cells had proliferated around certain of these vessels. Thus the tissue in such regions presented an appearance, intermediate between Oroya fever and ver- ruga peruana, which suggested incipient verruga for- mation. Weiss (1927a) in cases of verruga found areas of skin between the nodules to be diffusely infiltrated with angioblasts. The cedematous areas on which nodules later appear show an increase in number and dilatation of the capillaries with proliferation of cells of the ves- sel walls; the same proliferation was noted in the pre- eruptive petechiae, where lesions of the endothelium were followed by hemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration (Weiss, 1933). To summarize, the verruga is a specific granuloma caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. It is characterized, particularly during the formative stage, by numerous new-formed blood vessels and by the, proliferation of vascular endothelial cells often in compact masses, and is distinguished by the presence of bartonellae demon- strable, with suitable technique, within the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells and in their vicinity. Connective tissue, less conspicuous in the younger lesions, becomes more prominent in the older nodules. Pathogenesis "Nothing is known of the pathogeny," Monge stated (1912a); since that time, conjectures have been nu- merous but evidence has been scanty. The oedema, often seen before the eruption, was related to three causes, at times acting concomitantly: the anemia, in- flammation of lymph vessels, and, when situated on the lower extremities, a circulatory obstacle (Odriozola, 1898). The formation of nodules in monkeys may be fairly regularly obtained. However, verruga development by no means necessarily follows bartonella infection. The nature of the infecting inoculum is very important in the type of manifestation which follows. Experience has shown that the inoculation of human Oroya fever blood is followed by blood infection, but not by ver- rugas. Cultures in semi-solid medium, inoculated into the skin, do produce nodules. In an attempt to eluci- date this peculiarity, the author and Dr. Pinkerton in- jected heavily infected human blood into a rhesus mon- key and sterile semi-solid medium into the skin. In the blood of the animal, bartonellae were repeatedly de- tected by cultures and finally seen in films, but the medium was slowly resorbed and no verrugas ap- peared. Similarly, during blood infection, local in- jury to the epidermis or to the dermis will not cause verrugas (Noguchi, 1927c). Townsend (1915b) ex- plained verruga formation by a complicated life cycle of the parasite for which no evidence has subsequently</page><page sequence="26">266 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY been found. Weiss (1933) believes that the eruption is an allergic reaction (p. 278). The cellular proliferation, so conspicuous in this granuloma, was related to a hypothetical mitosis-in- ducing secretion of the parasite by Escomel (1902). Similarly, Noguchi (1927c) supposed that mitosis of parasitized endothelial cells resulted from a stimulus furnished by the parasite; this stimulus was apparently not provided by killed cultures, which provided no re- action in a M. rhesus monkey (Noguchi, 1927d). The verrugas are often larger in splenectomized mon- keys (Mayer and Kikuth, 1927). Partial ablation dur- ing growth, either in man (Kuczynski-Godard, 1937d) or in monkeys (Noguchi, 1927c), may be followed by excessive development. Experimental Verruga Peruana Human verrugas were produced by the 1913 Har- vard Expedition to Peru, then by other investigators.36 The eruption appeared 16 to 21 days after inoculation (p. 250) and was localized or in some cases generalized. The inoculum has been verruga tissue (Harvard, 1915) and cultures (Battistini, 1927a; Kuczynski-Godard, 1937b, 1937a, 1937d) inoculated in or below the skin. In one instance, that of Garcia Rossel, the inoculum was Oroya fever blood; subsequently a generalized verruga eruption developed. It is not known whether asymptomatic infection antedated the blood injection. Kuczynski-Godard has made detailed reports on the results of several series of self-inoculations. The first series of three injections of Oroya fever strains grown on human blood agar or broth was made between April 30 and May 8, 1937, presumably on, in, or below the skin. First symptoms appeared May 17, persisted for 11 days, consisted of bone and joint pains, headache, weakness, and two short periods of fever, and then subsided (Kuczynski-Godard, 1937b). Blood cultures were obtained May 20 and May 22 (Mackehenie, 1937). A series of reinoculations was performed between June 6 and August .17, 1937. Twelve different injec- tions were made in at least 16 different places, all on the forearms. Two Oroya fever strains grown on hu- man blood agar, consisting of the first to the seventh subcultures, were utilized, the inoculum being placed on scarified areas or injected intra- or subcutaneously. The first verruga appeared July 23; afterwards the eruption continued, showing some generalization, through the early days of September. Nodules ap- peared at the injection spots and elsewhere; they were 36 These are: 1. Strong, Tyzzer, Brues, Sellards, and Gastiaburu (1913). 2. Monteverde, 192-(?). These experiments were never published nor is any protocol available (Mackehenie, 1937). Monge (1925b) stated that one subject pre- sented a generalized eruption. 3. Battistini (1927a). 4. Garcia Rossel, details in Rebagliati (1940) and Gonz'alez Olaechea (1932b). 5. Kuczynski-Godard (1937a, 1937b, 1937d). particularly numerous on the face; a mulaire lesion de- veloped at a subcutaneous injection site (Kuczynski- Godard, 1937a). Two large verrugas developed only after regional surgical intervention, which was con- sidered responsible for their marked growth (Kuczyn- ski-Godard, 1937d). Mackehenie (1937) noted sub- cutaneous nodules spaced along the lymph vessels, connected by smaller cordlike structures and suggest- ing lymphangitis. Rheumatoid symptoms were noted during some days of each of the four months, June to September; this was once accompanied by an effusion into the elbow. Fever was likewise temporary and irregular, did not accom- pany the rheumatoid pains, and was not above 38.50 C. during the generalized eruption. The red count fell as low as 3,100,000, and the hemoglobin to 54 percent. Bartonellae were never observed in films, but blood cultures were positive on June 16 and July 17. The local reactions were interesting, and some of these apparently peculiar to the experimental disease. Immediate inflammation was the first result, then bluish or violet spots became apparent at the injection sites, and persisted about 50 days. Allergic responses were obtained in certain of the latter injections; in one in- stance the immediate reaction lasted for 40 hours and was accompanied by shock phenomena and irregular heart action (Kuczynski-Godard, 1937a); the possible part played by sensitivity to the injected medium was not specified. In animals, verruga peruana is most regularly and completely reproduced in the monkey. Jadassohn and Seiffert (1910) were the first to discover this suscepti- bility and to demonstrate it by serial passage. Macaca miulatta has been most widely utilized; a wide variety of other monkeys and apes have also been used suc- cessfully.37 Satisfactory inocula are provided by: verruga tissue (Jadassohn and Seiffert, 1910); cultures (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926) ; and Oroya fever lymph nodes (Wein- man and Pinkerton, 1937a). These should be applied 37 Monkeys and apes susceptible to verruga peruana Animal Author Rhesus monkey Cersuih sabeu Jadassohn and Seiffert, 1910 Cercopithecus sabeusJ Cebus sp.

Applied to the intact skin, infec- tious material has induced no local lesion (Noguchi, 1927c). Blood, even when containing enormous numbers of organisms and irrespective of the route of inoculation, does not produce verrugas in monkeys.38 This is one of the most puzzling features of the infection. Like- wise, when infected phlebotomi, the presumptive natu- ral vectors, are injected (Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler, 1929; Battistini, 1931) or are allowed to feed (Battistini, 1931; Hertig, 1940c; 1942a) on M. mulatta monkeys, infection has resulted, but not ver- rugas.39 Nodules usually develop only at the site of inocula- tion; occasionally a few may appear at some distance (Noguchi, 1927b, 1927c, 1927a), but the eruption does not generalize. The incubation period is variable; it is always more than 10 days until the verrugas are macroscopically recognizable (Noguchi, 1927c), and in a case of the author's, it was 60 days. Usually, the incubation period is between 10 and 15 days, the le- sions mature after an equal interval, persist about two weeks, and regress during a variable period, complete resolution requiring four or five months in some in- stances (Noguchi, 1927c). Blood cultures are usu- ally positive when verrugas are present. The animals are not conspicuously ill, there may be a mild fever, and regional lymph nodes are often en- larged. Noguchi (1927b) sacrificed five verruga-bear- ing monkeys for histological purposes; the spleen was always somewhat enlarged, the lymph-nodes were al- ways swollen and congested. One animal presented splenic infarctions and lungs covered with a dozen gray semitransparent nodules which contained large mononuclear cells, capillaries with swollen endothelium, and, in a few of the endothelial cells, bartonellae. These lesions were termed "verruga-like nodules . . . in the lungs and spleen," although from a description given the histology scarcely resembled that of a verruga. The dog after subcutaneous inoculation sometimes develops a vascular lesion (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915).40 After the intradermal inoculation of cultures and a monkey verruga, Noguchi et al. (1929b) ob- tained a lesion stated to be "similar" to verruga. Al- 38 There is one recorded exception. Noguchi (1927a) ob- tained this result by the intradermal inoculation of infected mon- key blood; the blood of the donor apparently contained no visible bartonellae. Also, Kikuth (1932) states that he and Mayer produced verrugas by blood injections; no reference is given and no description of the experiment has been found; con- versely, Mayer and Kikuth (1927) did say that every direct inoculation of bartonella-containing blood was negative. 39 A similar result was obtained from the bites of experi- mentally infected Dermacentor andersoni ticks (Noguchi, 1926d). 40 The first claim to verruga production in this animal is ap- parently that of Tamayo (1899a). though all blood samples drawn were sterile, bartonella was recovered in culture from the lesion 12 days af- ter inoculation (Noguchi, Muller, Tilden, and Tyler, 1929b). The dog has proved to be satisfactory only to Samper and Montoya (1940). They used Colom- bian animals, termed "gozque" locally, and apparently of unknown genetic constitution. Many of their ani- mals developed nodules containing intracellular bar- tonellae. The lesion was considered to be a verruga, although no histological report was made. Cultures obtained from the blood produced verrugas in monkeys. Curiously, the mortality in the dogs was very high, reaching 50 percent, although no Oroya fever syn- drome was observed. Other investigators have not ob- tained equally satisfactory results; this variation results perhaps from some peculiarity in the dog strain uti- lized.41 INTERMEDIATE AND ATYPICAL CLINICAL FORMS The majority of cases of Carrion's disease are, at any given time, either frank verruga or Oroya fever. Some mixed forms have been noted, but even in these, overwhelming blood infection with marked anemia ap- parently never coincides with a widespread, typical eruption. In Oroya fever, recovery from even the very severe forms may not be followed by any eruption (Odriozola, 1898; Rebagliati, 1940). Conversely, verruga may not be preceded by any marked anemic phase. Also, the normal sequence is sometimes inverted and the erup- tion precedes Oroya fever (Odriozola, 1898). Finally, Oroya fever may be interrupted at intervals by slight and transitory eruptions; such cases terminate either fatally or in typical verruga peruana (Rebagliati, 1940). In these atypical forms secondary infections have often been noted. ASYMPTOMATIC BARTONELLOSIS Until recently it was not known that a considerable number of infected persons offered no manifestation of bartonellosis. Battistini (1927a) recovered the organ- ism from one healthy individual and was apparently the first to do so. The author and Dr. Pinkerton (1937b) undertook investigations in an endemic zone in Peru. There it was found that 5 of 53 unselected and aDDar- 41 Isolated observations exist, requiring confirmation of ver- ruga production in the following animals: Donkey Arce, Mackehenie, and Ribeyro (1913) Goat Arce, Mackehenie, and Ribeyro (1913) Sheep Arce, Mackehenie, and Ribeyro (1913) Donkey Noguchi, Muller, Tilden, and Tyler (1929b) Chicken (leghorn) }Makehei (1936) Guinea pigMakhne(96 Guinea pig Patifio (1940e) Chicken Aldana (1929) Also, according to popular non-medical opinion, at one time current in Peru, all domestic animals and birds contract the disease (Shannon, 1929).</page><page sequence="28">268 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY ently normal individuals gave positive blood cultures. In none of the five were bartonellae visible in stained blood films made at the same time. Three gave no past history of Carrion's disease, while two stated that they had suffered from verruga six months previously. Hurtado (1939) obtained analogous results: 7 car- riers of 53 asymptomatic cases cultured, 4 with a past history of disease, 3 without. It thus appears that about 10 percent of the persons in areas of the "ver- ruga zone" may be carriers, and about half or 5 per- cent have never suffered from the disease. The duration of latent infection in postconvalescents may be long. Cultures have been obtained one year and a half after recovery from verruga (Aldana, 1929), and in one instance from a 44-year-old man who stated that he had verrugas in the first year of life (Hurtado, 1939). Whether these particular cases represent single or repeated infections is uncertain, but a case history given by Escomel (1938) suggests that infection may be maintained for a period of years in the absence of any reinfection. His patient had an attack of verruga in Peru, then went to Europe where he lived for 20 years. On his return, he sought medical consultation in Lima, before passing through any known endemic zone, for a new growth on the toe. This was excised and found to be a typical verruga containing numerous bartonellae. The patient stated that during his resi- dence abroad several such tumors had been removed surgically. This report indicates not only that latent infection may be very prolonged but also that resist- ance to it is subject to fluctuations. The effect of secondary infection on bartonella car- riers offers a suggestive hypothesis. Inapparent bar- tonella infection is a result of a delicate balance be- tween pathogenic bartonellae and the defenses of the host. We have seen that this balance may be disturbed, leading in turn to a manifestation of bartonellosis. While the causes which provoke Carrion's disease in a previously latent carrier are not known, it seems not improbable that one might be certain secondary infec- tions. In animals, precisely such a result follows cer- tain double infections in haemobartonella carriers. Thus a relapse may be provoked in rats latently in- fected with Haemobartonella muris after the inocula- tion of trypanosomes (Trypanosoma lewisi) or of bac- teria (Salmlonella, Pasteurella). The analogy is, how- ever, even closer, for in Bartonella bacilliformis infec- tions we have already noted that the inoculation of Oroya fever blood usually produces no disease in monkeys; but, in two of the extremely rare instances where an Oroya-fever-like syndrome has been repro- duced with such inocula, both monkeys were suffering from extensive concomitant tuberculosis. Decisive hu- man data on this point do not yet exist, but the ap- parently high incidence of secondary infection in Car- rion's disease may, in some instances, be similarly explained. Experimental asymptomatic bartonellosis is readily produced in monkeys by the inoculation of infectious blood, of human or of simian origin, by any route. Cultures may produce the same state, particularly when injected intravenously. PROTISTOLOGY The genus Bartonella has already been defined and certain important historical events have been considered (pp. 246-249). After the discovery of natural infec- tions in animals with organisms resembling bartonella, these were at first classified in the same genus. As in- formation increased, it became evident that the animal parasites were all similar to each other and all strikingly different from Bartonella. Accordingly they were placed in the genus Haemobartonella for reasons developed in more detail elsewhere (p. 289), leaving Bartonella a monotypic genus with the species bacilliformis. SYNONYMY At first named Bartonia bacilliformis (Strong, Tyz- zer, Brues, Sellards, and Gastiaburui, 1913), this ge- neric name was found to be preoccupied; subsequently Bartonella was proposed (Strong, Tyzzer, and Sellards, 1915a). The following terms constitute partial or total syn- onyms: Bartonella cocoide [!] Hercelles (1926b); Bartonella peruviana Escomel (1929); and Eperythro- zoon noguchii Lwoff and Vaucel (1930). MORPHOLOGY Bartonella bacilliformis is extremely polymorphous and shows the greatest morphological range in the blood of man. In Giemsa-stained films it appears as red-violet rods or coccoids, situated on the red cells. The bacilliform bodies are most typical, and extremely numerous in the heavy infections. Fairly uniform in size, they measure from l,u to 3u in length, by 0.25p to 0.50 in width, and are often distributed in rows of three or more, suggesting prior segmentation. Fre- quently adjacent rods will be at an angle with one an- other, giving a bayonet, V, or y appearance, and ex- ceptionally they are grouped in sheaves of parallel or slightly criss-cross elements (pl. I, fig. 1). The out- line is smooth. They are often curved and may show polar enlargement (Harvard, 1915). At one or both extremities granules staining somewhat differently from the rest of the organism may be-seen (Barton, 1909; Harvard, 1915). The rounded organisms measure about 0.75,u in di- ameter and resemble Howell-Jolly bodies or the ele- ments of Anaplasma, with perhaps a more irregular outline. They usually are interspersed with the rods on the same erythrocyte. A ringlike variety with a clear center, very similar in appearance to Eperythro- zoon coccoides, is sometimes abundant (pl. I, fig. 2). Barton (1909) described changes which take place prior to disappearance from the blood: the outline be-</page><page sequence="29">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 269 comes indefinite; sphere, hour-glass, and pear-shaped forms appear; finally these are reduced to a granular detritus. The author has noted, at the decline of visible blood infection, a predominance of rounded forms re- sembling Howell-Jolly bodies; this was apparently also the experience of Aldana (1929). In relation to the red cells, the bartonellae appear to be epi-erythrocytic, in the majority of cases at least, for they come into focus at both surfaces of the red cell, may be seen projecting beyond the margin of the cell, and occur free in the plasma. These free forms are increased after centrifugation (Aldana, 1929). More than 90 percent of the red cells may be'infected, and a single cell can carry a half-dozen or more parasites. At such a time morphological variation is extreme and even the leucocytes may be infected. Within the cir- culating monocytes bartonellae are easily identifiable and occur as scattered intracytoplasmic elements (pl. I, fig. 1). In the polymorphonuclear cells special stains are required for' their ready demonstration. In impression films of human or monkey tissue usu- ally only erythrocytic and intracellular forms are recog- nizable with certainty. The latter are grouped in com- pact masses whose individual elements appear as rods, coccoids, a mixture of both, or are sometimes quite in- distinct. The background of these clusters stains somewhat differently from that of the cell cytoplasm. In section material the appearance of the organism has already been described (pp. 256, 265). Cultural forms.-On semi-solid medium bartonella presents a mixture of rods and granules; the former predominate in young cultures (10 to 15 days); the latter in older ones. The organisms appear both singly, and in large and small, irregular, dense collec- tions with jagged edges, in which individual parasites can often be discerned only at the periphery. These' masses may measure 25,u or more in length, and after Giemsa staining they vary from red-violet to blue; the interstices are not colorless but stain a light blue sug- gesting a matrix. Rounded, regular masses, recalling the appearance in Oroya fever tissue, are very rarely observed. The individual organisms may vary in size according to the strain (Noguchi, 1928b). Punctiform, spindle-shaped, and oval forms, varying in length from 0.3,u to 3.0p% and in width from 0.2,u to 0.5,u, have been described (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926). The rods may be homogeneous or may have a clearer central por- tion, may be constricted in the center, and may show a varying number of darker-staining areas (Aldana, 1929). Bartonella grown in tisstue cultures or with surviving cells develops within the cytoplasm of cells and also ex- tracellularly. The resultant appearances range from that obtained on semi-solid medium to those seen in autopsy or biopsy material (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937a) ; in the chicken egg the growth thus far obtained has been predominantly extracellular, and red cell in- fection was not reported (Jim'nez and Buddingh, 1940). In the insect vector, the appearance and localization of bartonella have not yet been finally determined (p. 275). Stains of the Romanowsky type have been the most satisfactory, and Giemsa the most widely used. The usual aniline dyes stain unsatisfactorily or not at all. Bartonella is Gram-negative (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926; Battistini, 1928; Noguchi, 1928b; Aldana, 1929) and non-acidfast. It stains well in films with iron hemnatoxylin, a technique which may be used to demon- state the organism amidst neutrophilic granulations, and also sometimes in sections (Harvard, 1915). Sil- ver impregnation, Fontana-Tribondeau or some modi- fication, is very effective both on blood films (Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez, 1941b) and on cultures. Tests for iron on preserved blood films left the bartonellae unstained, according to both the Prussian-blue method and MacCallum's technique for masked iron. Flagella.-Described by Noguchi (1928b), who uti- lized the Zettnow-Fontana method on cultural material, the flagella were always unipolar, and varied in number from 1 to 4 and in length from 3,u to 10,u. Some were delicate, short, and smooth; others, wavy and coarse. In semi-solid medium, spiral structures have been noted by several authors: they range from 7MA to 30,u in length (Battistini, 1928), and for Noguchi (1928b) are de- tached flagella, become abnormally large, and are thrown off after a week or more in semi-solid medium. Basset-Smith claimed to have stained flagella on the blood forms (1913-14). No spores nor capsules have been found (Battistini, 1928; Aldana, 1929). Unstained, in the fresh blood bartonellae are difficult to detect with ordinary illumination, but may be seen as unpigmented transparent bodies which exhibit slow motility, particularly when the slide is kept warm (Harvard, 1915). Certain vital or supravital methods may stain some elements (Gastiaburu' and Rebagliati, 1909; Monge, 1912a; Aldana, 1929). In dry un- stained films Monge (1912a) found them very refrac- tile. Cultural colonies and individuals are readily seen with either light- or dark-field illumination; in the latter case the majority of organisms appear with a brilliant center and darker periphery; in some the bril- liant portion is peripheral and ringlike. Noguchi and Battistini (1926) found the organisms larger in dark- field preparations than after staining. BIOLOGY Reproduction.-Binary transverse division takes place in the blood (Harvard, 1915) and probably in cultures. Concerning the tissue forms there is not uni- form agreement, and some authors suppose that the intracellular bartonellae are in some special stage of a complex life cycle. Kikuth (1934) thus explains the habitual failure of blood inoculations to produce dis- ease. It seems equally possible that intracellular mass-</page><page sequence="30">270 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY ing is the response of bartonella to a particular envi- ronment, while the relative innocuousness of blood inoculations is due to some variation in virulence or infectivity in no way connected with any complicated cyclical development. Motility.-Movement has been observed in the fresh blood (Harvard, 1915; Hercelles, 1935a). Oscillatory, undulating, and rotatory motion takes place as well as progression in the direction of the long axis (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915). In cultures, motility is observed for a short period after transfers; then, sooner on semi-solid medium, and later on slants (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926), the organism always becomes motion- less (Noguchi, 1928b). Single organisms pass swiftly across the microscopic field, while the masses move more slowly (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926); rod forms move in the direction of their long axis, also possibly vertically (Samper and Montoya, 1940). A patho- genic strain with no apparent motility has been ob- served by the author, and apparently motile strains may fail to show motion even in young cultures (Noguchi, 1928b). Viability.-At room temperature (250 to 280 C.) survival is 28 days in verruga tissue, 67 days in citrated blood (Noguchi, 1926a), and 163 days in semi-solid medium (Samper and Montoya, 1940). At 40 C., survival reaches 152 days for citrated blood and 56 days for verruga tissue (Noguchi, 1926a). A freezing- drying method has been used "with success" (Samper and Montoya, 1940). Glycerination is not successful, and verruga tissue so treated has lost its ability to in- fect monkeys after a short time (Harvard, 1915). Resistance to physical and chemical agents.-The data furnished have been determined with cultures. A temperature of 550 C. kills in 10 minutes, 570 C. in 7 (Aldana, 1929), and 600 C. in 5 (Battistini, 1928). Aldana (1929) reported extreme sensitivity to light; when exposed shortly after inoculation, his cultures were said not to develop; however, growth once having taken place, light was without action. Glycerine in 40 percent concentration and bile in 10 percent killed the organism in 24 hours (Battistini, 1928). Added to 13-day cultures, neutroflavin inhibited growth at a final concentration of 1: 10,000,000; formalin, novasurol, neo- salvarsan, and mercuric chloride at a final concentra- tion of 1: 1,000,000. Tryparsamide and Lugol's solu- tion were ineffective at 1: 1,000 (Noguchi, 1928d). Formalin in a final concentration of 1 percent kills in 12 hours; at one-fourth of 1 percent subcultures are positive (Aldana, 1929). Filtration.-Uniformly negative results were ob- tained by Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) (verruga mate- rial Berkefeld No. 2, numerous trials); by Noguchi and Battistini (1926); by Battistini (1928) (cultures, 14 trials, 7 each with Berkefeld V and N; blood, 12 trials, 6 each with the same filters); by Mayer, Rocha-Lima, and Werner (1913a) (verruga material); and by Ki- kuth (1932) (Berkefeld M(!)). Virulence.-Barton (1911) suggested that the clini- cal duality of Carrion's disease results from two strains .of organisms, one producing Oroya fever, the other verruga. Subsequent investigations have not supported this hypothesis. Some strain variation in virulence apparently does exist, and Noguchi isolated strains from nonfebrile verruga patients which were entirely nonpathogenic for monkeys, since these strains pro- duced neither local lesions nor blood invasion detectable by culture (1928b). The identification of such strains might be difficult, but could perhaps be determined by tissue culture methods which reproduce the typical in- tracellular lesion (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937a). Virulence is conserved fairly well on semi-solid me- dium. After two years without animal passage, a strain so maintained by the author still produced verrugas in monkeys. Virulence decreases more rapidly on blood agar slants, owing to the necessity for more frequent subcultures (Noguchi, 1928b), and may be increased by passage through susceptible animals (Noguchi, 1926b). CULTIVATION Noguchi and Battistini in 1926 were the first to re- port cultivation of Bartonella bacilliformis, verruga pro- duction by the inoculation of cultures, and recovery of the organism from infected animals.42 The medium most widely utilized is the semi-solid agar devised by Noguchi and sometimes ambiguously referred to as "leptospira medium." 43 Other media have also been reported to be satisfac- tory, as the accompanying table will show, but it should be emphasized that the majority of the published cul- tural characteristics were determined in semi-solid medium. Certain advantages have been reported for: (1) a wholly autoclaved medium devised by Jimenez (1940); (2) media capable of furnishing homogeneous suspensions, and an enriched semi-solid medium which, Geiman (1941) states, may give positive results where the original type fails. Poor or no growth, or failure to maintain the strain 42 The priority of Noguchi and Battistini seems incontestable, but this is not evident from the literature, which is unclear on the following two points. (a) Battistini in 1925 stated that he had cultivated the organism from 1920 onward. No reference to a 1920 paper is given, and the earliest relevant publications found appeared in 1925 (1925b; 1925a). In these papers an organism consistent with bartonella is described. However, identification of this organism was incomplete in several par- ticulars, and nodule production in monkeys by the inoculation of cultures was not described by Battistini until later, in the collaborative study with Noguchi. (b) Hercelles (1926b) re- ported that with collaborators he cultivated bartonella before Noguchi and Battistini; however, as Hercelles himself states, their publication anteceded his own. 43 Formula: 0.9% NaCl 800 parts Fresh rabbit serum 100 parts 2% nutrient agar (pH 7.4) 100 parts Rabbit hemoglobin * 10-20 parts * (Lake 1 part of defibrinated blood with 3 of distilled water.)</page><page sequence="31">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 271 MEDIA ON WHICH GROWTH OF Bartonella bacilliformis HAS BEEN REPORTED Medium Author Semi-solid agar with blood of rabbit, horse, or man Noguchi and Battistini, 1926 * Idem and fresh tissue Noguchi and Battistini, 1926 Idem and glucose or maltose or inulin Noguchi and Battistini, 1926 Idem and glucose or maltose or inulin and fresh tissue Noguchi and Battistini, 1926 Horse blood (20%) nutrient agar slants Noguchi and Battistini, 1926 Agar serum slants, with or without sugars Battistini, 1928 N.

Sources of Bartonella bacilliformis.-Cultures are ob- tained from the blood both in asymptomatic cases and in those with Carrion's disease, also from the viscera in Oroya fever and from the nodules and lymph nodes in verruga. The titer in the blood varies considerably, positive cultures have on occasion been obtained with a dilution of 1: 10,000,000 (Noguchi, 1926c).4 440 = with or without. 45 Escomel (1940) obtained cultures of an organism from the urine, apparently after passage, which he considered to be bartonella. This identification is not convincing. Aldana (1929) never obtained cultures from urine obtained by catheterization. Growth becomes evident in semi-solid medium, usu- ally after one or two weeks at 28? C., within the top- most centimeter of the medium as a grayish haze or as a collection of gray-white granules, sometimes forming a narrow band. Individual colonies are spherical or irregular, rarely measure more than one millimeter in diameter, and are often colnsiderably smaller. At times the colonies may be disseminated throughout the me- dium and they may not be apparent until after four weeks. pH.-The optimum is 7.8 with a range from 6.8 to 8.4; there is no variation in morphology corresponding to changes in the acidity (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926), and growth of bartonella does not alter the pH of the medium (Battistini, 1928). Optimtm temnperature.-The most favorable tem- perature is 28? C. (Battistini, 1928) ; at 370 growth is just as abundant, but at the lower temperature growth continues longer and survival is more prolonged (No- guchi and Battistini, 1926). Survival in semi-solid medium is 50 days at 370 C. (Noguchi, 1926a). At room temperature it may reach 163 days (Samper and Montoya, 1940); at 250 to 280 C., monthly subinoculations are adequate for maintenance. On horse-blood agar slants maintained at 300 C., colonies are minute, grayish, transparent, raised, shiny, firm, and difficult to scrape from the surface. The very largest colonies do not exceed 2 mm. in diameter at the end of five days (Noguchi, 1928b). Slants are not so satisfactory as semi-solid medium, for they are less often successful for isolation and require more rapid transfers (Noguchi, 1928b) ; conversely, motility is retained better on the slants (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926). On Huntoon's hormone agar the colonies are similar, and the majority had the rough appearance; only a few were of the smooth type, and occasionally there was confluent growth (Samper and Montoya, 1940). Tissue or Maitland type cultures.-By utilizing rat and guinea-pig lung, bone marrow, spleen, and tunica vaginalis, and by inoculating blood or cultures, abun- dant growth was obtained, taking place both intra- and extracellularly. Intracytoplasmic collections appeared as early as the fourth day, and the appearance obtained reproduced those seen in vascular endothelium in Oroya fever (Pinkerton and Weinman, 1937a). Embryonated chicken eggs.-Eight- and twelve-day- old eggs may be successfully inoculated. The tempera- ture of secondary incubation giving best results was 250 to 280 C. Most abundant growth was obtained after direct inoculation into the chorio-allantoic fluid. The latter became distinctly turbid after 72 hours and contained great numbers of organisms, usually clumped. Six passages were made at 72-hour intervals. After inoculation in the yolk sac, growth was very abundant in 48 to 72 hours; the majority of the organisms were found in the yolk fluid, and some within the yolk mem-</page><page sequence="32">272 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY brane cells. Pathological changes were slight when the organisms were placed on the intact chorio-allantoic membrane, and consisted in temporary inflammation and cedema. When preceded by scarification, pin-point to pin-head crateriform lesions developed in 48 hours, forming opaque white nodules by 96 hours, then re- gressing to leave only a linear depression. The ecto- derm showed evidence of mechanical injury only. The mesoderm was rich in new-formed capillaries; it pre- sented considerable cedema i and foci of hemorrhage scattered throughout. Vessels were surrounded by a mononuclear infiltrate, which also contained a few polymorphonuclears, and by proliferated fibroblasts. In such areas there were small foci of necrosis. Or- ganisms were found within mononuclear cells and occasionally in the cytoplasm of giant cells. Serial transfer of the ground lesions was not successful on the second passage. Erythrocyte infection was not de- scribed (Jimenez and Buddingh, 1940). Metabolism.-Bartonella is an obligate aerobe (No- guchi and Battistini, 1926). On agar plates, the addi- tion of autoclaved blood, containing the thermostabile growth factor "x" alone, permitted numerous sub- cultures; whereas with only the labile "v" factor ob- tained from yeast, the third transfer was negative (Jimenez, 1940). There was no production either of gas or of acid with the following carbohydrates: dex- trose, saccharose, galactose, maltose, levulose, xylose, lactose, mannose, mannitol, dulcitol, arabinose, raffi- nose, rhamnose, dextrin, inulin, salicin, and amygdalin (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926). Bartonella has no action on lead acetate, decolorizes neither neutral red nor Congo red, and does not liquefy gelatine (Aldana, 1929). Red blood cells in culture are not hemolyzed (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926; Aldana, 1929). The organism does not localize about the red cells either in semi-solid medium or in citrated blood (Noguchi, 1926a), where some ml-ultiplication does take place. INOCULATION OF ANIMALS Data concerning the reproduction of Carrion's dis- ease in monkeys, apes, and dogs have already been presented (pp. 259, 266). Other animals react differ- ently to Bartoniella bacilliformis. The rabbit.-Inoculated intratesticularly, the rabbit may develop a lesion in 22 days, constituted by necrotic foci infiltrated with leucocytes. A number of passages can be made, but eventually the inoculated testis fails to infect the monkey (Harvard, 1915). Battistini used this limited survival as a method of purifying contami- nated verruga material (p. 263). After intradermal inoculation with cultures and monkey verrugas, small swellings develop, then disappear rapidly (Samper and Montoya, 1940). The guinea pig.-Cavies splenectomized or normal, young or adult, develop neither Oroya fever nor ver- ruga, and the organism cannot be recovered in cultures after a very few days (Weinman and Pinkerton, 1937a, 1938). Similar negative results with guinea pigs have been obtained by other authors utilizing various inocula and routes of injection (Jadassohn and Seiffert, 1910; Noguchi and Battistini, 1926; Noguchi, 1928c; Aldana, 1929; Samper and Montoya, 1940). Mooser's phenomenon has, however, been reported after the intraperitoneal inoculation of blood and ver- ruga fluid (Mackenhenie and Davila, 1932), of fluid from the human pleura (Mackehenie, Coronado, and Jimenez, 1933), and of ground verruga tissue (Patifio, 1939b). In these instances it is not stated nor apparent that the inoculum contained only bartonella. Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941a) have given the most suggestive account; 37 guinea pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with 13 bloods rich in bartonella. In 8 animals the Mooser phenomenon appeared the third or fourth day, lasted for 3 or 4 days, and was accom- panied by fever lasting 1 to 4 days. These authors elsewhere state that in their human cases secondary blood infections were altogether exceptional. Finally, verruga production in guinea pigs has been claimed by Patifio (1940e), after the intradermal in- oculation of cultures, and by Mackehenie (1936), who states that cultures so injected give rise to a granuloma; but a convincing histological description of a guinea- pig verruga is yet to be made. The donkey.-One of three animals utilized by No- guchi, Muller, Tilden, and Tyler (1929b) presented a local swelling at the site of intradermal inoculation; microscopically the lesion does not seem to have been a typical verruga. The donkey reacts in a very pe- culiar fashion to the intravenous inoculation of heat- killed cultures or of Berkefeld V filtrates of cultures, by the production of large raised areas in various parts of the body within 72 to 240 hours. These apparently persist for some time, for a biopsy was performed on one 8 months after its appearance and revealed only fat tissue. Negative or indefinite results were reported for: albino rats which were Haernobartonella-muris-free, and normal, splenectomized, or lead-intoxicated (Wein- man and Pinkerton); pigeons, hens, and rats (Jadas- sohn and Seiffert, 1910); rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs (Noguchi and Battistini, 1926); guinea pigs, dogs, an-d sheep (Aldana, 1929); white mice splenectomized or normal (2 animals, Swiss stock), agoutis (Dasyprocta variegata) (Samper and Mon- toya, 1940). Splenectomized rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats are no less resistant than normal animals (No- guchi, 1928b). TAXONOMY After the cultivation of Bartonella bacilliformis by Noguchi and Battistini (1926), and with the support of evidence derived from human and animal material, the bacteriumlike nature of this organism has impressed recent investigators. Tyzzer and Weinman (1939), on the basis of all available information and from</page><page sequence="33">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTOENLLA AND RELATED PARASITES 273 comparative studies with related organisms, find thal there is no longer any question of the non-protozoan character of bartonella. At one time it was considered to be a protozoon (Barton, 1909; Gastiaburu' and Re- bagliati, 1909; Harvard, 1915), while certain investi- gators pointed out resemblances to the inclusion- producing viruses (Mayer, Rocha-Lima, and Werner, 1913a). But a study of cultural material suggested definitive classification as a bacterium (Noguchi, 1927a; Aldana, 1929). Several systematic bacteriologists have accepted this view, without, however, stating just where amongst the bacteria they consider bartonella correctly placed.46 Resemblances to Anaplasma (Galli-Valerio, 1911) and to Rickettsia (Battistini, 1927a; Mackehenie, 1936) have been pointed out. While erythrocytic in- fection is altogether exceptional in the rickettsioses, Strong (1940) has assembled isolated reports of red blood cell infection in Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Japanese river fever. Conversely, a "fundamental therapeutic difference," based upon the activity of the sulfonamides in certain rickettsial diseases and their inactivity against bartonella, was emphasized, perhaps too strongly, by Kikuth (1940). Tyzzer and Weinman (1939) considered that Bartonella and other non- nucleated parasites of the red and white blood cells (Haemnobartonella, Anaplasma, Eperythrozoon, Graha- nella, Cytoecetes, Aegyptianella, "Rickettsia canis") } together with Rickettsia, formed an interrelated grour which it was not advantageous at the time to classify further. It was anticipated that additional information concerning morphological characters in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, modes of multiplication, distribution in tissues, pathogenicity, immunology, host specificity and reaction to drugs, and splenectomy, might afford a more solid basis for subsequent grouping. Suprageneric classification.-The family Anaplas- midae was proposed by Neitz, Alexander, and Du Toit (1934) to include the genera Anaplasma, Grahamnella, Bartonella (sensu lato), and Eperythrozoon. The family was defined as "small blood parasites, round, oval, rod-shaped, or irregular in shape, whose average size is 0.51u to 1.()u. They lie either in or on the red cells or occur free in the plasma. They may be non- pathogenic or pathogenic, in which case they most fre- quently produce fever followed by a variable degree of anemia. Transmission takes place probably in all in- stances by arthropods." lThese four genera are quite possibly closely related, but it should be noted that our information concerning them is still very inadequate: the appearance and method of reproduction in culture of anaplasma and eperythrozoon is not known, and for none of these para- 46Topley and Wilson (1937) and Zinsser and Bayne-Jones (1934) place bartonella among "miscellaneous bacteria"; it is not listed in the latest edition of Bergey's Manual of Deter- minative Bacteriology (1939). sites have the morphology and the mode of multiplica- tion in the invertebrate vector been established. The additional proposal to place the family Anaplas- midae in the order Haemosporidia seems unwarranted, since none of these parasites present either nuclear differentiation or evidence of sexuality, two of the no- table characteristics of the Sporozoa. Furthermore, recent studies on Grahamiiella indicate that it is not a protozoon at all, and Tyzzer (1942) proposes its classi- fication in the family Actinomycetaceae. EPIDEMIOLOGY TRANSMISSION The early records of Carrion's disease emphasized both the endemicity within certain areas and the appar- ently infectious nature of the malady.47 Of the expla- nations offered, the water theory was most popular. It was thus supposed that the water of certain wells or springs, when imbibed, would invariably produce ver- rugas. Dounon (1871) and Leon (Rios, 1888) drank such waters, but did not fall ill, and this theory fell into disrepute. The disease did not seem to be contagious, and after several suggestions, notably that of Arce in 1889 (Har- vard, 1915), the concept of arthropod transmission gained consideration. It was only, however, after the advent of successful cultural methods that convincing evidence was obtained incriminating sandflies (Phlebo- tomus) as a natural vector (Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler, 1929). CONDITIONS PREVAILING IN THE ENDEMIC AREAS The verruga zones thus far discovered all lie within the tropics and in mountainous territory; they are usu- ally situated between 2,500 and 8,000 feet,48 in the vicinity of water, with fairly sharply defined upper and lower boundaries.49 The limits of the zone extend and the cases of the disease increase at the time of flood and the beginning of regression of the rivers (Odrio- zola, 1898; Harvard, 1915; Weiss, 1933). There are repeated reports that landslides, earthquakes, and very abundant rains are followed by a notable increase in the number of cases (Martinez, 1922; Maldonado, 1933b; Groot, 1941; etc.). In Peru nocturnal transmission appears to prevail, if not to be exclusive. In numerous instances strangers to the zone have passed only daylight hours there, or have slept under netting at night and have not con- tracted the disease. Conversely, one night in the zone may suffice for infection. Shannon (1929) found nhle- 47Experimental infection by natural means within the ver- ruga zone was demonstrated by Battistini (1927a), who ex- posed three monkeys for 45 days and subsequently obtained posi- tive blood cultures frorm all of them. 48Extreme values are given as 600 feet (Esquina de Asia, Peru; Rebagliati, 1940), and 15,000 feet (Weiss, 1933). It is not stated that the cases were not imported. 49 For additional details, see pp. 249-250: "Geographical Dis- tribution."</page><page sequence="34">274 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY botomi to constitute almost the only nocturnal blood- suckers in the endemic zone of the Rimac Valley in Peru. They were inactive during the day, but after twilight left their shelter in caves, excavations, etc., and could then be taken in houses.30 For this region lie noted the following meteorological conditions. The annual rainfall was 10 to 20 inches, and the rainy sea- son extended from February to the middle of April. During this season, night temperatures fell as low as 530 to 580 F., varying according to the altitude. In the same period, fluctuations between night and day tem- peratures were slight, but increased in the dry season to reach 100 to 150. Phlebotomi were most numerous from March to the middle of June, and apparently could be found throughout the year. They were not taken outside of the endemic zone; below, the region was rela- tively arid, with 2 to 4 inches of rainfall annually, while above the upper limit of 7,800 feet the night tempera- tures were low. Investigation of the fauna of verruga regions has in no instance, when vigorously pursued, failed to reveal phlebotomus as present, often in large numbers. Addi- tional information concerning other animals (Shannon, 1929) and the flora (Maldonado, 1933b; Harvard, 1915) of the endemic zones in Peru is available. MECHANISM OF TRANSMISSION Arthropoda Phlebotomnus.51-Townsend first incriminated ticks to the exclusion of other bloodsuckers (1913b) ; then phlebotomus (1914c; 1915a). Although he undertook experiments to prove the latter contention,5' none were demonstrative, and it was not until the investigations of Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler that evidence of a more than circumstantial sort was obtained (1929). The evidence now consists of the following: (1) wild phlebotomi captured in the verruga zone when injected into monkeys will produce infection detectable by blood culture (Noguchi, Shannon, et al., 1929; Battistini, 1931); (2) wild phlebotomi have given pure cultures of bartonella (Battistini, 1931); (3) wild phlebotomi fed on monkeys infect these with bartonella detectable by blood cultures (Battistini, 1931; Hertig 1940c, 1942b). " In Colombia there is daytime exposure to sandflies, accord- ing to Osorno (1939). The panama-hat weavers of that coun- try find suitable conditions for work in caves or huts which are humid, dark, and protected against air currents. This en- vironment seems to be a favorable one for phlebotomi, in which they are presumed to be active even during the day. 51 Hertig's "Phlebotomus and Carrion's Disease" (1942b) is an excellent and complete monograph on this subject and should be consulted by all who are interested. .2 These involved experiments with dogs, monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, and in addition two human cases: Messrs. Nichol- son and McGuire (1914c; 1915a). Nicholson was bitten, prob- ably by phlebotomus, and later developed Carrion's disease. However, since he was a constant visitor to the verruga zone, other means of transmission could not be excluded. McGuire left Peru, and the results were indefinite. In the endemic regions of Peru three species of Phlebotomun,s have been described: P. verrutcarutm, P. noguchii, and P. peruensis. Noguchi, Shannon, Til- den, and Tyler (1929) considered their respective roles as vectors to be: P. noguchii, certain; P. verritcarnin1, probable; P. peritensis, doubtful. At that time, however, as Hertig (1938) has pointed out, the females of noguchii and verrutcarumt could not be distinguished, so that the relative importance of the species must be reconsidered. Hertig discovered fea- tures which permit identification of living females of the two species. P. noguchii "is not known to bite man," although in the field it will feed on mammals, e. g. white mice (Hertig, 1942a), whereas P. verru- carumt bites man readily (Hertig, 1938). P. perutensis, probably a human feeder, is limited to that part of the zone above 5,000 feet (Hertig, 1942a), and has been collected least often of the three (Shannon, 1929; Her- tig, 1938). Thus, in the areas studied, P. verrucarumn appears to be the most importanit of these vectors, in so far as human infection is concerned.53 The natural incidence of infection in phlebotomus is difficult to evaluate from the available data. Hertig (1942b) obtained wide fluctuations. Thus in feeding experiments an average of 18 fed flies sufficed in 3 monkeys; whereas, in computation- from Hertig's data, an average of 57.5 fed flies did not infect 6 others. Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler (1929) tested wild sandflies shipped to New York. Monkeys were inoculated with the insects, and bartonella was subse- quently cultured from the blood. Calculations from their data indicate that the positive lots were constituted by an average of 31 females; the negative lots, including one of 100 females, some poorly preserved, averaged 28. One positive lot was obtained from 10 females; Battistini obtained positive results with a batch of 19 (1931). The method of testing, by inoculation into monkey and subsequent recovery from the blood, seems somewhat insensitive, since the positive lots yielded failures in 50 percent of the monkeys (Noguchi, Shan- non, et al., 1929). While there is some indication that intravenous inoculation may give a higher yield of cul- tures than intradermal, direct culture from the phlebo- tomus, which Battistini (1931) lhas shown to be feasi- ble, would seem to be the most sensitive as well as the most informative of the available methods. Mcthod of transmission.-Transmiission may be ef- fected exclusively through feeding. Such were Her- tig's conclusions (1942b) from experiments in which the flies were enclosed in feeding cages. Thus, crush- ing of the insects could be excluded, anid contamination of the bite-wound in all probability did not occur. Monkeys, after phlebotomus injection, develop posi- tive blood cultures about the twelfth day, and at times somewhat earlier after feeding of the sandflies (Battis- 53Hertig's positive feeding experiments (1942b) involved almost only, if not exclusively, P. verr?ucarum}Z.</page><page sequence="35">WA7'.TNTMAN4- ANTPMTAq TTJPF TO fRARTOYVT T A AND RPT ATPE PARASITTES tini, 1931). In no instance has a monkey yet devel- oped verrugas or Oroya fever after intracutaneous, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection, or the feeding of phlebotomi (Noguchi, Shannon, et al., 1928; Battis- tini, 1931; Hertig, 1942a). The position of bartonella in phlebotomus.-Hertig has investigated this problem, utilizing both cultural and histological techniques. Individual cultures were made from the intestinal tracts of 84 wild P. verra- caru?m fed on patients or monkeys; 34 were contami- nated; of the remaining 50, 4 were positive, a propor- tion of only 8 percent (Hertig, 1942a). Cultures from the mouthparts by means of artificial pipette feeding were completely negative in 107 trials involving chiefly wild P. verrucarum (Hertig 1942a); but in another report cultures from the stylets of two flies yielded growth of an organism consistent with B. bacilliformis (Hertig, 1940c; 1942b). Microscopic examination of wild sandflies fed on patients with numerous bartonella in the blood showed, in 75 percent of 90 fed flies, an organism in the intes- tinal content and in fecal drops morphologically con- sistent with bartonella. In sections these organisms appeared in large numbers in the lumen of the mid- intestine; they did not grow on semi-solid medium and their identity was therefore not definitely proved (Her- tig, 1937). Occasionally the organisms were 'found within the epithelial cells. Flies fed on patients show- ing no visible blood infection developed no comparable infection, but in about 3 to 4 percent of such flies a few scattered organisms were found on the epithelial surface (Hertig, 1942a). Other investigations indicated to Hertig that the in- testine of P. verrucaruin was not particularly favorable to the growth of bartonella. However, on the pro- boscis of many wild flies a bartonellalike organism was observed often in great numbers, and, as we have noted, cultures from the stylets of two fed female flies yielded growth of an organism consistent with Barto- nella bacilliformis. One infected stylet on which or- ganisms were seen growing between the spines of the labrum-epipharynx gave a pure culture of Bartontella bacilliformis. By the use of a. highly ingenious tech- nique Hertig fed sandflies on cultures of B. bacilliforminis but did not produce heavy proboscis infections, and it now appears that besides bartonella at least one other organism is involved in these infections of the mouth- parts (Hertig, 1942b). Concerning multiplication and length of survival in phlebotomus, complete information is not yet available; live insects sealed in tubes in Peru and shipped to New York under refrigeration. contained viable barto- nellae on arrival (Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Ty- ler, 1929). Four other species of phlebotomus occur in Peru (P. amazontensis, panamnensis, intermiedius, and squami- ventris), of which the last two are known to bite man (Bequaert, 1938). The specimens were taken outside of the verruga zone and have not been incriminated as bartonella carriers. Other bloodsucking Arthropoda from the verruga zone were in no instance shown to harbor bartonella when tested by inoculation into mon- keys and by subsequent blood culture (p. 276). In the Colombian epidemic area Brumpt collected extensive entomological material. According to Patifio (1940e), the following species were identified by Brumpt or his collaborator Ristorcelli: P. longipalpis, P. evansi, P. osornoi, P. columbianuss, P. monticolus var. iicarumn. None of the species characteristic of the Peruvian verruga zone were taken. Two other species, P. panamensis and P. squamtiventris, were later found in Colombia (.Patinio, Cifuentes, and Sanchez Herrera, 1940). Phlebotom1u1ts longipalpis and P. squamiiventris are known human bloodsuckers (Be- quaert, 1938). In Ecuador, Bequaert (1938) has no record of phlebotomus as late as 1938. Apparently there has been little entomological investigation in connection with bartonellosis; the populace incriminates an un- identified insect known locally as "chinche" or "chin- chorro" (Montalvan, 1940). Congenital transmission in phlebotomus.-Trans- mission to the offspring has been neither established nor disproved. Shannon (1929) and Maldonado (1933b), impressed by the apparently high incidence of infec- tion of sandflies from barren regions which thus offered no obvious source of bartonella, supposed that infection passed through the egg. However, the same data may be differently interpreted to indicate the possibility of animal reservoirs on which these insects have fed.54 Other Arthropoda.-No bloodsucking arthropod other than phlebotomus has ever been shown to be naturally infected with bartonella. Dermacentor an- dersoni, after feeding on an infected monkey, if trans- ferred immediately to a new monkey, may transmit infection (Noguchi, 1926d). "Probably this is a purely mechanical process without significance, so far as the natural insect vector of Carrion's disease is con- cerned,"' state Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler (1928). Bartonella was recovered from viscera of the ticks at six, but not at eleven or more days (Noguchi, 1926d). Gonzales Olaechea (1933a) reported the altogether exceptional cases of two patients, mother and son, who had never left Lima, Peru, and consequently had never been within the verruga zone, and none the less devel- oped verrugas. A neighbor was known to have had verrugas, and while the latter was ill, the house was invaded by "mosquitoes." It is suggested that the transmitter was not phlebotomus, but some other "acci- dental vector" which carried the infection. Extensive collections of Arthropoda parasitic on man and animals, made in a verruga zone of Peru, gave only 54 Hertig (1942b) states that one of his bartonella strains was isolated from a field mouse.</page><page sequence="36">276 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY negative results when tested in monkeys (Noguchi, Shannon, Tilden, and Tyler, 1929).5 Patifio (1939b) believes that in Colombia the human louse is a natural vector, and that Ornithodorus vente- zuelensis transmitted the disease to guinea pigs by feed- ing more than one month after t-he human blood meal. Neither of these views has been proven.56 Congenital Transmtission Reports of Carrion's disease in new-born infants have been made by Salazar (1858), Monge (1912a), and S. Garcia (in Odriozola, 1898, and in Campodonico, 1908). The most convincing and circumstantial account is that given by Malpartida (1937). The pregnant mother had been in the verruga region 38 days prior to her illness. At the end of April she complained of pains in the bones, and on June 1 had a violent chill accompanied by headache with fever rising to 40? C. (1040 F.). On June 10 her child was born, appar- ently after an 81/2 month pregnancy; it weighed 2,800 grams, was 46 centimeters long, and appeared normal. The placenta was not remarkable, the membranes were complete. The mother subsequently underwent a brief attack of acute bartonellosis, blood parasites were seen on June 14 (4 days post partum), the red cell count fell to 1,660,000 on June 22 and then increased. The child when 14 days old (June 24) seemed weak; a blood examination then showed 90 percent of the red cells with bartonella, and an erythrocyte count of 1,830,- 000. The following day weakness was very marked, the skin and mucosae pale, the ocular conjunctivae icteric. Death took place on June 26, 16 days after birth, with signs of marked anemia and icterus; no autopsy was performed. Two mechanisms for the transmission were considered by Malpartida: trans- placental, and through the mother's milk. He is in- clined to favor the first possibility, but the funda- mental data are unknown: there was no histological examination of the placenta nor any report of attempts to cultivate bartonella from the milk. The incidence of congenital transmission is not known. It is a problem readily accessible to experi- mental attack and should yield interesting results. Otalora (1939) is of the opinion that bartonella caused 55 These include specimens of the following genera: ticks, Orntithodorus, Argas; mites, Tarsotomus, Trombidium, Gecko- bia, Geckobiella; lice, Trichodectes; fleas, Pulex, Ctenocephalus, Rhopalopsyllus; Hemiptera, Cirnex; mosquitoes, Anopheles, Cu- lex; buffalo gnats, Simulium; midges, Forcipomyia; Muscidae, Stomoxys; Hippoboscidae, Melophagus; Strebilidae, three gen- era from vampire bats. 56 Doctors C. B. Philip and Q. M. Geiman have kindly made available unpublished results which are of interest. Larvae of Ornithodoros rudis (= vcezeuelensis) were fed on skin areas directly overlying monkey verrugas, the animals giving posi- tive blood cultures at the time. Ten to fifteen days later, after one molt, the ticks were non-infective for two monkeys; one by feeding, one by injection. many of the stillbirths and deaths prior to 15 days of age which he noted during the Colombian epidemic. Transmxissioni by Contact Contact transmission does not take place under ordi- nary circumstances. From patients hospitalized out- side of the verruga zone there is no spread to other patients or the nursing personnel (Dounon, 1871). There have been no records of laboratory infection due to dropping of infectious material upon the skin, and it has not been demonstrated that bartonella can pass through the unbroken skin (p. 267). Dounon (1871) considers it possible that contact of denuded skin or mucus surfaces may allow of transmis- sion. He thus explains certain cases where in succes- sion different members of a family become ill, as result- ing from the contact involved in suckling, coitus, etc. This mode of infection may well occur, but the above evidence is not demonstrative, since the families appar- ently all resided in the endemic area and may have con- tracted the disease in the usual manner. FACTORS AFFECTING SUSCEPTIBILITY AND RESISTANCE Much of our information is derived from relatively old sources and may therefore require subsequent rec- tification. Carrion's disease has been observed in per- sons of all ages, races, and both sexes (Carrion, 1886; Odriozola, 1898; Monge, 1912a). Age.-In the newborn, Oroya fever is very severe; all cases coming to Odriozola's attention ended fatally. In children up to the age of ten, the disease is mild, becoming more active in adolescents and reaching full malignancy in adults; in familial cases the parents may die with the disease while the children are scarcely in- convenienced (Gomez, 1912). In the aged, the disease is stated to be mild (Odriozola, 1898). Sex.-When the patients requiring hospitalization for Carrion's disease in Lima were divided into sex groups, the mortality rate for males was found to be 22 percent; that for females, only 9 percent (Kuczyn- ski, 1937d). Previous exposurc.-This is apparently a very im- portant factor. The history of the epidemics has em- phasized this point, for they occur when a previously unexposed population becomes infected. In Peru the epidemic of 1870 followed the importation of workers into the verruga zone; while in the more recent Co- lombian outbreak it appeared that bartonellosis spread into areas previously uninfected. Strangers in an endemic zone often develop severe Oroya fever, whereas the natives do so less frequently (Odriozola, 1898; Monge, 1912a). The more mild character of the disease in residents of the endemic zone is attributed by Monge (1912a) and by Gomez (1912) to early benign childhood attacks which pro- vide later resistance to the infection. The findings of</page><page sequence="37">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 277 Hurtado (1939) indicate that the inhabitants usually acquire the disease in early childhood. Secondary infections.-The outcome of the disease is said to be profoundly influenced by complicating infec- tions, and the present author has suggested that they may cause the disease to appear in previously asympto- matic carriers. The subject has been discussed else- where in more detail (p. 268). Finally, it has been stated, but not proved, that the disease is influenced by a variety of other factors, such as fatigue and debility (Carrion, 1886), poor nutrition in general, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies in par- ticular (Kuczynski, 1938b; etc.). SOURCES OF BARTONELLA Man is the only important mammalian source of Bartonella bacilliformis now known. In this host, bar- tonella is readily accessible to hematophagous Arthro- poda, since it may be recovered from the blood stream in all the different stages of the infection. Man also serves as a means of transportation of the organism, particularly during the asymptomatic phase when he is not even indisposed and thus able to move about freely. Of other animals, phlebotomus is the only one now known to be naturally infected.57 The once current belief that many domestic animals contract Carrion's disease has not been confirmed (p. 267). Yet Samper and Montoya (1940) have successfully inoculated dogs, so that this animal may at some time be found naturally infected, although Weinman and Pinkerton (1937b) found no lesions attributable to bartonella, nor blood infection detectable by cultures in ten dogs living in endemic areas in Peru. Lizards were supposed by Townsend (191Sa) to be a likely reservoir of bartonella, apparently because some species of phlebotomi feed on these animals, and barto- nelliform bodies were seen in the erythrocytes of the Peruvian lizard Tropidurus peruvianuts. While nucle- ated red cells were found in the blood meal of Peruvian phlebotomi, and considered to be of lizard origin, it is not known that the same species of phlebotomus at- tacks man. Furthermore, there is no present reason to believe that the erythrocytic structures in the lizard are Bartonella bacilliformis (p. 319). Field rats were suggested by Escomel (1935), on hypothetical grounds only,58 as a possible reservoir, while Patifio believed guinea pigs might fulfill this role. However, all carefully controlled experimental inocula- tions of guinea pigs have given negative results. Plants as reservoirs of bartonella have been accepted on wholly inadequate grounds by a variety of investi- gators (Maldonado, 1930 and 1933b; Weiss, 1930; Mackehenie and Coronado, 1933 and 1934; Escomel, 1935; Ch'avez-Lazo, 1936). Indeed, as a prophylactic 57An exception would seem to be a single field mouse from which Hertig (1942b) isolated a strain of bartonella. 58 See footnote 57. measure, it has several times been suggested that the incriminated plants 5 be uprooted in the verruga zone. Since this supposition has been widely circulated, it is important to emphasize that there is no reason at all to believe it to be valid. Hercelles (1936) also has been adversely critical of the theory. The only crucial experiments encountered, in which an organism recov- ered from a plant was injected into monkeys, resulted negatively (Mackehenie and Jimenez Franco, 1935).60 IMMUNOLOGY NATURAL AND ACQUIRED IMMUNITY Immunity to infection has not been demonstrated in individuals of susceptible species.61 Man, once in- fected, shows a considerable variation in response, ranging from acute fulminating cases to those without any symptoms. Acquired immunity becomes apparent both during and after the disease. Pertinent data have been obtained from both man and the monkey, but since the immunological responses in these two animals are probably not identical, the information will be pre- sented separately. LATENT INFECTION It has been shown (p. 267) that a number of indi- viduals exposed to infection contract bartonellosis but show no manifestation of Carrion's disease. Theoreti- cally, such cases may be explained by infection with only non-pathogenic strains. Actually, numerous asymptomatic infections occur in endemic areas where cases of Oroya fever and verruga are frequent, and where the inhabitants live under conditions such that they are not at all protected against repeated reinfec- tions (Weinman and Pinkerton, 1937b). Presumably, therefore, these carriers are, at some time or other, in- fected with the strains which proved pathogenic for their neighbors. It may also be held that a quantitative difference in the number of organisms inoculated may account for some of these cases. Human data bearing on this point are not available. Experimentally, a monkey was inoculated with a culture of a pathogenic strain in which growth was not apparent and in which no or- ganisms could be detected grossly or microscopically. The incubation period was extremely prolonged, but, after 60 days, perfectly typical verrugas developed at the inoculation sites (Weinman and Pinkerton). In man, intrinsic factors of susceptibility and resist- ance are very probably of at least as much importance as variations in pathogenicity and the infecting dose of the orpani'sm 9 Those usually cited are the huanarpo macho (= Jatropha basiacantha), and the huanarpo hembra (= Jatropha macrantha) (Escomel, 1935). 60 According to Mackehenie and Coronado, there is an agglu- tination, apparently non-specific, for the organism, obtained from plants, with serum from patients with Carri6n's disease, to a titre as high as 1: 1,600 and even 1: 3,200. 61 The dog may possibly prove to be an exception (p. 267).</page><page sequence="38">278 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY The individual who manifests no disease despite in- fection with pathogenic bartonellae, yet is unable to eradicate the infection, seems to be in a state of pre- carious immunological equilibrium. This delicate bal- ance strongly suggests the condition of premunition, known to exist in animals infected with haemobarto- nellae. In man, this balance may be disturbed fronm causes at present unknown, and the carrier then de- velops some form of Carrion's disease. The causation is more evident in haemobartonella-infected carrier ani- mals in which splenectomy regularly, and secondary infection often, changes the latent infection into evident disease. In man, no data concerning the effect of sple- nectomy are available. However, certain cases of Car- rion's disease, apparently complicated by secondary infection, may in reality correspond, for example, to a paratyphoid fever, which, evolving in a bartonella car- rier, diminishes the partial resistance to the latter and thus makes manifest the previously well-tolerated bartonellosis. Latent infection after recovery.-This state is not uncommon and may apparently persist for years (p. 268). The incidence of these postconvalescent carriers is not yet known, nor, conversely, has it been deter- mined how often the disease is followed by a sterilizing immunity. Finally, we are also in ignorance whether, if a state of sterile immunity is once reached, the resist- ance continues, or whether, with disappearance of the infection, the immunity also vanishes. IMMUNITY DURING THE DISEASE The habitual sequence, according to which Oroya fever is followed by verruga, signifies the change from a highly fatal form to a mild one in which recovery is habitual, and accordingly is interpreted as a manifesta- tion of immunity During and after the change from the one form to the other, blood destruction diminishes or ceases, the parasites disappear from the erythrocytes and multiply in the new-formed verrugas. The under- lying cause of these phenomena are not yet- known. The suggestion that a complex life cycle of the parasite is the determining factor has not been supported by evi- dence. Consequently, attention has been directed to the nature of the host's response. Weiss (1933) emphasizes a cellular basis to the im- munity in Oroya fever and supposes that parasites dis- appear from the red cells after immunization of the erythrocytes.62 Other non-specific immunological re- sponses were diminished during the Oroya feve-r stage, the pre-eruptive period, and the early stages of the eruption. Thus, (a) the tuberculin reaction was weak or negative until the eruption was fully developed, then once again became frankly positive 63; (b) similarly, a 62 He accordingly believes that the reported harmful effects of transfusions result from the introduction of non-immune erythrocytes which are favorable to the development of bartonellae. 63 Carpio (1939) performed the von Pirquet tuberculin test positive Wassermann test became temporarily negative during Oroya fever when tested on two occasions, and positive on later tests; (c) a staphylococcus antigen normally causing vesicle formation provoked little or no reaction prior to frank verruga eruption. Weiss believes these observations justify the concept of a general lowering of defense reactions until the eruption is well established. This state is attributed, not as he first conceived, to blockade of the reticulo- endothelial system with phagocyted erythrocytes, but to direct action of the bartonellae. The eruption is considered to be an allergic reaction of an unspecified type and to coincide with a period of heightened gen- eral resistance. To the present writer, it is not appa- rent that verruga is an allergic reaction in the classical sense of the term, according to which a second infec- tion produces an entirely different response than the original reaction. Although conceivably the cases where verruga follows Oroya fever might somehow be classed in this category, how are we to account for the numerous instances both in man and in monkeys where verruga is the first and only disease to follow inocula- tion? Since allergy does not seem to apply in this restricted sense, and it is not made clear what other meaning the term has, it is not evident how its use in any way advances our knowledge of the underlying im- munological phenomena. A thorough understanding of the acquired resistance to Oroya fever remains to be achieved. We are now aware that the hemolytic phenomena diminish or cease before the eruption begins, but until the mechanism of the blood destruction is understood, we shall probably not know why. Serological studies have not provided very much in- formation thus far. No hemolysins have been found in patients (pp. 255, 262) nor demonstrated in cul- tures (p. 272).64 Complement deviation tests were negative when a verruga nodule antigen and sera from nine verruga patients were utilized (Strong, Tyzzer, and Sellards, 1915b), but positive with a cultural anti- gen and human serum obtained after recovery from verruga (Aldana, 1929). Agglutination and precipitation studies have been hampered by lack of uniform suspensions of bartonellae suitable for such tests. Howe (1941) has prepared satisfactory suspensions and reports agglutination of bartonellae with sera of patients. The highest titre was 1: 80, obtained in two cases of extensive verruga eruption, while two cases of Oroya fever did not agglu- tinate above 1: 20. In a later study agglutinins were found in both patients and carriers. Of 73 patients, about 35 percent gave sera agglutinating at titres vary- in 5 cases of Oroya fever: all were negative during the 4 fol- lowing days; 6 cases of verruga gave 4 positives and 2 nega- tives in an equal period. 640ne report exists of an extract prepared from a verruga nodule which contained a hemolysin active at 1: 1,000 (Har- vard, 1915).</page><page sequence="39">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 279 ing from 1: 320 to 1: 2. The reaction was most often positive when bartonellae were demonstrable in films and could be obtained in blood cultures, but the ag- glutinating action often disappeared while cultures remained positive. Howe judged it unlikely that ag- glutinins play any major part in acquired immunity. After immunization with formolized cultures, agglu- tinins appear (Howe, 1943). Non-specific bacterial agglutination has not been ob- served with Proteus X 19 by Ribeyro (1919), Jara- millo (1939), or Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b); nor with Proteus XK and OX by Jaramillo (1939); nor with Proteus XK, X2, typhoid (O&amp;H), paratyphoid A and B, Brutcella abortus and melitensis, Shiga, Hiss, and Flexner bacilli, and Pasteurella bovi- septica by Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b) .65 The Wassermann test was negative in two cases of Oroya fever and four of verruga (Harvard, 1915). Superinfection.-Kuczynski-Godard studied this question after auto-inoculations with cultures of bar- tonella made at least once every month from April throughout August, 1937. A febrile illness began 17 days after the first injection and persisted for 11 days in May, during which period positive blood cultures were obtained on two different days. Reinoculations performed in June and in the following months were followed by an abundant eruption of verrugas. There- fore the early non-eruptive infection did not prevent subsequent verruga development. An allergic reaction was noted after some of the later injections in the series (see also p. 266). Immunity in animals.-During the disease, monkeys whose blood yields cultures of bartonella do not develop verrugas at the sites of epidermal or dermal injury to normal skin (Noguchi, 1927c) or of intracutane- ous injection of semi-solid medium (Weinman and Pinkerton). As will be seen later, after formation and regres- sion of the verrugas, the monkey subsequently becomes refractory, and this immunity prevents successful skin reinoculation. During the primary infection, reinocu- lation with verruga tissue gave only negative results when applied to scarified areas, while after intradermal injection additional verrugas appeared (Noguchi, 1927c). Noguchi does not state whether the primary infection resulted in verruga formation or not-a point of importance, for it has not been shown that blood- stream infection alone will subsequently lead to the same degree of skin immunity which the verrugas produce. 65 Howe (1941) obtained agglutination of Proteus OX 19 at a dilution of 1: 64 or more, in four of six sera obtained from patients with Carrion's disease. Previous typhus infection in these patients could not be excluded. Agglutination of para- typhoidlike bacilli isolated from cases of Oroya fever, by the serum of patients with Oroya fever, was reported by the early investigators (see Harvard, 1915). See also footnote 60. IMMUNITY AFTER THE DISEASE In man second attacks of bartonellosis, usually ver- ruga, do occur (see, for example, Hertig, 1942b: 17); however, the usual history of most patients includes only one eruptive episode. Since these persons in- clude many living within the endemic zone and there- fore continually exposed to reinfection, the infrequency of second attacks bespeaks a certain degree of acquired immunity. As we have noted (p. 267), this resistance appears to coincide with latent infection in at least some of the cases. Weiss (1933) appears to be of the opinion that true sterile immunity also exists in man; the author has not found any report in which the sup- porting data are presented. Circulating antibodies have been found in the sera of former verruga patients as late as eight years after the eruption by Aldana (1929), who obtained complement fixation, using an emulsion of bartonellae as antigen. The monkey develops a very marked resistance to reinoculation, and this is apparently a sterile i.mmunity. As Strong, Tyzzer, et al. (1915) were the first to show, if the inoculated monkey develops verrugas, after re- gression of these nodules the animal becomes refractory to reinoculation in almost every instance. This re- fractory period has persisted for more than five months after the primary inoculation (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915). Their observations have been confirmed by all later investigations. Noguchi (1927d) tested nine animals, eight M. rhesuis and one chimpanzee, for bar- tonellae before reinoculation by attempting to recover the organism in culture from the blood and from lymp'h nodes. None gave positive cultures. Upon subse- quent reinoculation none developed verrugas or gave positive blood cultures. If the primary inoculation in the monkey results only in inapparent infection, this may none the less produce sterile immunity and prevent subsequent skin eruption and bloodstream infection (Noguchi, 1927d). IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF BARTONELLA Bartonellae from different sources all seem to pro- voke very similar responses. The subject has been studied in monkeys and in the rabbit. In the latter animal, Howe (1943, in press) has demonstrated that antibodies may be produced in the serum, agglutinating bartonella at titres as high as 1: 2,560. Cross immunity.-Bartonellae derived from Oroya fever protect against the organisms obtained from ver- ruga cases. Thus ten monkeys were inoculated with an Oroya fever culture strain; then after blood and lymph node cultures had become sterile, they were re- inoculated by a double injection with monkey verruga tissue from both an Oroya and a verruga strain. In the reinoculated animals no sign of infection was de- tected. The Oroya strain thus immunized against it- self as well as against the verruga strain. Likewise rabbits, artificially immunized with the Oroya strain,</page><page sequence="40">280 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY furnished complement fixing sera for the same and heterologous strains (Noguchi, 1928b; 1927a). It seems probable that similar results would follow initial immuniization with the verruga strain. Verrugas obtained by inoculation of the Colombian strain of bartonella immunized monkeys to reinocula- tion with both the Peruvian and the Colombian strains (Samper and Montoya, 1940). Howe's results (1941) are concordant; cross agglutination between these two strains was obtained with homologous and heterologous rabbit sera to almost equal titre. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNIZATION Vaccines.-Howe (1943) and Hertig, in an experi- menit not yet terminated, are following the course of 22 volunteers, all non-exposed persons with negative blood cultures, who received subcutaneous injections of for- molized suspensions of Bartonella bacilliformis and then took up residence in an endemic area. Thus far, at the end of two months, 9 have become infected and given positive blood cultures, but none have shown any signs of "severe illness." Cultures of bartonella, killed by an unspecified method, and inoculated on two occa- sions into a M. rhesits by an unspecified route, did not prevent subsequent development of verruga in this ani- mal (Noguchi, 1927d). An early claim to successful immunization of rabbits, following the injection of ver- rugas subjected to heating or glycerination, was not demonstrative when first claimed, and requires confir- mation (Ribeyro, Mackehenie, and Arce, 1914b). Ihumatntne sera.-Such serum, prepared in rabbits, fixes complement (Noguchi, 1927a; 1928b), but under the conditions of the experiment furnished little or no protection to monkeys (Noguchi, 1928c). - Convalescent monkey serum.-Pooled lots of serum from several animals, administered in a single 20-cc. dose 24 hours before inoculation, appeared to exert some effect in monkeys. Although verrugas did de- velop, the incubation period was considerably pro- longed, and positive blood cultures were obtained in only one of three cases. Similar results were obtained with multiple doses, of which only one of 20 cc. was administered before the inoculation. When the first dose of 20 cc. was administered five days after inocula- tion, the nodules progressed normally, but blood cul- tures became negative (Noguchi, Muller, Tilden, and Tyler, 1929a). The convalescent serum thus appeared to have a decided effect on the bloodstream infection. This is a distinctly promising restilt, since in humans the pernicious form of the disease, Oroya fever, is that in which blood infection is most marked (see also p. 281). THERAPY There is no treatment of marked efficacity for Car- ri6on's disease. The primary therapeutic problem is Oroya fever, the form with high mortality. But here investigation has been very seriously handicapped by inability to produce this syndrome at will in animals. The numerous reports of "cures" of verruga should be considered with full knowledge that recovery without any treatment occurs in most cases. The procedures instituted have involved the use of anti-parasitic drugs and immunizing and supportive measures. ANTI-PARASITIC MEDICATION Sdt 386 B, a product containing 18 percent arsenic and 20 percent antimony (Schmidt and Peter, 1937), seems highly effective in Haernobartonella muris infec- tion of rats. Kikuth (1940) states that it "is also spe- cifically effective in Oroya fever of man," apparently basing his opinion upon the therapeutic trials of Man- rique and Rocha (vide infra). In 1937, in Dr. Man- rique's wards, which were hospitably opened to the au- thor, I was able to follow one Oroya fever case so treated. This patient received 1.0 gm. of the product in six days, despite which the erythrocytes decreased, the parasite count remained at the same level, and the patient died. The subsequent autopsy, performed by Dr. Pinkerton and the author, yielded tissue containing endothelial cells crowded with parasites which retained their normal appearance and staining affinities. Thus, in this case sdt 386 B produced no apparent benefit whatsoever. Jaramillo (1939) found this product to be "not satisfactory" in the treatmient of Oroya fever. Carpio (1939) used it on 11 patients, of which 8 subse- quently died and 3 developed verrugas; a result not conspicuously better than that obtained in untreated cases. The most favorable as well as the most detailed re- ports are those of Manrique and Rocha (1937). They found the drug well tolerated with a highest single dose of 0.30 gm. and the highest total amount 5.70 gm.; it was usually injected on alternate days and apparently always intravenously. Of their cases, 14 were mark- edly anemic, with coUtnts ranging from 560,000 to 1,- 800,000. In this series there were 5 deaths; of these none had received more than 1.25 gm. and 2 had con- comitant paratyphoid infection. Of the 9 recoveries, including the case with 560,000 red cells, it was stated that 6 developed verrugas, while 2 did not. One recov- ered case received a total of 1.85 gm., after which blood cultures were still positive. NManrique and Rocha con- clude that the drug is of decided benefit in all stages of the disease, an evaluation which, we have seen, is not shared by others who have used it. Other arsenical preparations have been used, but recent opinion is that they are not helpful (Jaramillo, 1939), while Patifno (1939b) believes that when used in high doses, they may be harmful. Manrique and Rocha (1937) suggest that the poor results obtained with salvarsan may perhaps be due to faulty technique. It is difficult to evaluate this criticism, since the litera- ture lacks details concerning single and total doses, rhythm of infection, etc. In monkeys, neosalvarsan</page><page sequence="41">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 281 given in two 0.1 gm. injections, two days apart, or salvarsan in two injections of 0.05 gm., did not prevent verruga formation, but were said to hasten their regres- sion (Noguchi, 1928b), while in another experiment no regression was noted during six days following a 0.15 gm. dose of neosalvarsan (Cunha and Muniz, 1928a). -Prontosil (Carpio, 1939) and "various derivatives" of sulfanilamide (Jaramillo, 1939), quinine (Patiilo, 1939b), and neutral salts of acriflavin (Jaramillo, 1939) have been used without notably favorable results; like- wise chaulmoogra oil esters and other derivatives, neutroflavin, and proflavin in monkeys (Noguchi, 1928d). IMMUNOLOGICAL THERAPY Designed to produce the eruption.-This forms the basis for one of the oldest methods of attempted ther- apy. Logical in its conception, unfortunately, as Odri- ozola states (1914b), there is nothing known which favors or provokes the eruption. Methods designed to this end include vapor baths followed by the applica- tion of sinapisms (Dounon, 1871), massage with spirits of turpentine (Escomel, 1929), and the use of various urticating and other plants whose employ is still often requested if not required by the patient.66 Convalescent seruitm.-Odriozola (1914b) did not find such serum satisfactory; Olaechea (1932) consid- ered the results promising but inconclusive. Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b) treated eight cases with doses varying from 3 to 96 cc. administered sub- cutaneously; the effect was stated not to have justi- fied the discomfort to the patient and the effort of preparation. Although this method has not proved to be of value, it is not evident that doses and routes of administration were so chosen as to obtain maximum benefit. In view of experimental results in monkeys (p. 280), the intra- venous injection of large doses would seem the most effective. Convalescent transfusions. - Surprisingly enough, convalescent transfusions do not seem to have been uti- lized in Oroya fever, yet this therapy would appear to be promising, providing at once the benefits of a trans- fusion per se as well as the administration of immune substances. In 1939 the author had arranged to test this method, but war conditions prevented realization of the plan; it is to be hoped that some one more ad- vantageously situated may be able to carry out the project, utilizing adequate doses of blood administered intravenously. 66 Plants used in Carrion's disease and cited in the literature are:, "una de gato" (Buettneria hirsuta), Rubus urticifolius (Maldonado, 1933b); "mato" (Aristolochia tenera), "chamana" (Dodonea viscosa), "fnorbillo" (Passiflora littoralis) (Odri- ozola, 1898); 'suelda consuelda" (Ephedra americana) (Mal- donado, 1933b); "quishuar" (Budleja incana), "molle" (Schinus molle) (Odriozola, 1898). Perhaps the most widely used of all is a decoction of corn (Zea mays). Immune sera prepared in animals and vaccines.- Howe (1943, in press) prepared immune sera in rab- bits with agglutinating titres as high as 1: 2,560. These were tested for curative effects in three human cases of Oroya fever; the total doses varied from 50 to 60 cc. and were administered intravenously. While no dramatic clinical effect was noted, a drop in the num- bers of infected erythrocytes was attributed to the se- rum, and in one patient a verruga eruption appeared sooner than in the average case. Autohemotherapy was not satisfactory (Martinez, 1922). Ribeyro (1933), noting a high incidence of fatal cases of Oroya fever when complicated by paratyphoid fever, urged prophylactic vaccination against the latter. SUPPORTIVE MEASURES Transfusions.-In Peru these are widely considered to have harmful effects. Thus Weiss (1933) speaks of the unfortunate results which have followed the many attempts at transfusion.67 Aldana (1929) reports one such case. Parasites had been very numerous, then decreased, and were becoming rare when a transfusion was given. During the injection there were "inexpli- cable" shock phenomena. The bartonellae commenced to increase in numbers, the blood was soon intensely parasitized, and the patient died three days later. There was no evidence of secondary infection. The "protein shock" might, in this case, at least as much as the transfused blood, have been responsible for the unfavorable outcome. Groot, Mayoral, and Martinez (1941b) have used citrated blood in transfusions with no untoward results. Liver preparations, while they do not halt the anemia, may somewhat accentuate bone marrow activity (Hur- tado, Pons, and Meriino, 1938). Copper, iron, vita- mins, and other products have been given with results pleasing to the administrators (Kuczynski-Godard, 1937a, 1937b, 1937d, 1938b; Jaramillo, 1939). As an antipyretic, quinine is ineffective (Odriozola), and has seemed harmful to Patifio (1939b), whereas salicylic acid (Odriozola, 1898) and probably its derivatives are activated. Verrugas usually require no treatment; if excision seems advisable it is preferable to await full growth, otherwise a new element may develop at its place (Rebagliati, 1940). Experimentally, X-ray irradiation, in a single skin erythema dose in monkeys, either halted growth of the verrugas or caused an earlier regression than normally observed; irradiation prior to inoculation retarded but did not prevent growth of the nodules (Muller and Tyler, 1930). CONTROL The various phases of this problem are considered in chapter IV, "The Public Health Aspects of Bar- tonellosis." 6,7 Weiss (1933) suggests that transfused "non-immune" erythrocytes favor the development of bartonellae.</page><page sequence="42">1927a.

Infections in the vertebrate host are often latent; in such carriers splenectomy is followed by multiplication of the para- sites. They stain well with Romanowsky type stains, poorly with other aniline dyes, and do not appear violet in Gram's method. The experimental host range is restricted; e. g., infectivity of a rodent species for other members of the Rodentia is common, but of a rodent species for any primate, unknown. Classification into more inclusive groups presents certain difficulties. Neitz, Alexander, and Du Toit (1934b) proposed a new family, the Anaplasmidae, to include these organisms and the genera Anaplasma, Graham1ella, Bartonellac, and Eperythrozoon; the family itself, they state, "most protozoologists would presuma- bly place in the order Haemosporidia." 1 Topley and Wilson (1937), bacteriologists, classify the three last- named genera amongst the "Miscellaneous Bacteria," whereas Tyzzer (1942) has shown resemblances be- tween Grahamtella and Actinonyces mnuris and classifies the former in the family Actinomycetaceae. This lack of agreement results from certain deficien- cies in present knowledge. The ultimate position of the haemobartonellae will probably become evident only with additional information concernling their morphol- 1 It is doubtful whether most protozoologists would place or- ganisms showing neither nuclear differentiation nor evidence of sexuality amongst the SDorozoa. 288</page><page sequence="49">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 289 ogy and behavior in the invertebrate host and in cul- tures. Characters known at present indicate bacterial affiliations, although considered as bacteria the haemo- bartonellae constitute a quite atypical and distinct group. Distinguishing features of the four most closely re- lated genera are given in table 1. Further considera- tion of the characters which differentiate haemobarto- nella from eperythrozoon are given on page 320. HISTORY AND DEFINITION OF THE GENUS The genus Haetobartonella was created in 1939. Prior to this, the animal bartonellae were classified in the preexisting genus Bartonella. As knowledge of the group accumulated, it became apparent that the human parasite Bartonella bacilliformis presented numerous distinctive characters placing it apart from the animal bartonellae, which, in turn, could all be grouped to- gether. The divergencies between the two groups of "bartonella" were greater than between other parasites classified in different genera. Finally the state was reached when employment of the term bartonella in a general statement was often either unclear or neces- sarily attended by extensive explanation. This seemed to defeat the purpose of nomenclature. A solution was offered by Tyzzer and Weinman (1939), who sub- divided the genus Bartonella Strong, Tyzzer, and Sel- lards, 1915, into the monotypic genus Bartonella, with the species bacilliformis, and Haemobartonella, type species H. muris. It seemed useful at the time to re- tain bartonella as an English term applying to organ- isms of both genera when such use did not result in confusion. Haemobartonella was thus defined: "New genus, type species H. muris Mayer, 1921, to include barto- nellae in which there is no demonstrable multiplication outside the blood and which do not produce cutaneous eruptions," while outstanding characteristics of Barto- nella bacilliformnis are development in fixed tissue cells and the causation of a verrucous eruption. Further- more, in contrast to B. bacilliformis, the haemobarto- nellae rarely produce disease without removal of the spleen, are markedly influenced by arsenotherapy, are almost all of world-wide distribution, and the charac- teristic disease may in each case be readily transmitted by the inoculation of infected blood into suitable hosts. SPECIFIC DIFFERENTIATION. THE TYPE SPECIES The different species are distinguished on the follow- ing bases: (1) host of origin; (2) range of hosts re- ceptive to experimental infection; (3) morphology and pathogenicity of the species in question, compared with the other species in the sanme host. Data derived from cultures have not yet proved useful for this purpose. Haemnobartonclla nituris (Mayer, 1921) is the type species of the genus and accordingly possesses all of the generic characters (q. v.). It is a widely distributed natural parasite of the albino rat, producing usually a TABLE 1 HOST DEVELOP- EFFECT OF CHEMO- GEOGRAPH- NATURAL IN- (NATURAL MENT ON POSITION ON SPLENEC- CLINICAL THERAPY ICAL DIS- VERTEBRATE OR EXPERI- OR IN RED CELL TOMY PICTURE (ORGANIC TRIBUTION HOST MENTAL) OR I TM ARSENICALS) Bartonella Man+ Red blood Epierythro- Monkey 0?

It is surely infectious also for albino mice, the rabbit, and certain other rodents. Relatively monomorphic in the rat, short rods and coccoids comprise almost all the forms. Neoarsphenamine and other organic arsenical com- pounds cure the disease and at sufficient dosage eradi- cate the infection. ENUMERATION OF THE NAMED SPECIES Twenty-one named species of haemobartonella have been encountered in the literature. The following list includes some that are probably misclassified; others that are definitely misnomers or synonyms. These species will be discussed later. PAGE PAGE 1. H. arvicolae ........ 312 11.

The red cells showed rod or diplococcoid elements which stained red with Giemsa's fluid, and were often numerous on a single cell. The authors considered that the elements in question were either parasites which, existing in a latent condition, had been made evident by the special circumstances, or resulted from an alteration of the erythrocytes themselves. They further noted that the action of Bayer 205 alone or of disintegrating trypano- somes alone were singly insufficient to produce the anemia and the bartonelliform bodies. In 1921 Mayer proposed the name Bartonella muris for these structures, still with the reservation that they might be red cell degeneration products. He added to the description the note that these elements, particu- larly the rods, were often more delicate than "true bartonellae." Similar structures were found in a mouse treated with 205. Attempts at inoculation were un- successful, and the bodies were not found in the viscera. The question would probably have remained uln- settled if other investigators, studying the function of the spleen, had not noted the rather disastrous results of splenectomy in the rat. Wolferth (1917), during investigations on blood changes in albino rats after splenectomy, noted that marked anemia and death followed in certain of his animals, while others appeared unaffected. The rats could be divided into two groups: those with spleens of normal size and those with splenomegaly. Post- splenectomy blood changes were marked only in the second group, which showed a red count of 2.5 million, a hemoglobin 25 percent of normal, leucocyte counts of 28,000 and above, and reticulocyte counts of 40 percent. Death took place in seven of eight cases. He believed the anemia to be due to hemolysis but found no evi- dence of infection and was at a loss for an explanation. Streuli (1918), Lepehne (1918), and Danoff (1919) noted hemoglobinuria in splenectomized rats, with a variable number of deaths toward the tenth day. Le- pehne noted the same phenomena in mice but not in the guinea pig or birds. Domagk (1924) confirmed the above observations and offered an ingenious ex- planation based on a lack of equilibrium between the erythrophagocytic and the erythropoietic systems, but why only somiie rats became anemiic was not satisfac- torily accounted for. Lauda (1925b) finally furnished the key to the prob- lem. Having noted that some of his animals remained well for thirty days after the operation, he injected them with blood and viscera of anemiic splenectomized rats. The anemic disease was reproduced in the inocu- lated animals, whereas all the splenectomized controls remained well. Lauda concluded that the anemia was caused by an infectious agent and that splenectomy produced the disease only in infected individuals. He proposed the term "infectious anemia of the rat" and made a detailed study of this anemia. All his efforts to find the infectious agent were fruitless, and although a virus was considered, the filtered blood did not re- produce the disease. The following year, 1926, Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, in confirming Lauda's experiments, found on the red cells the same bartonellalike structures seen by Mayer and Zeiss in 1920. They again proposed the name Bartonella mniris, this time without reservation in regard to their parasitic nature. Effective treatment with arsenic comiipounds was re- ported by the same authors in 1927; then Mayer, and Cannon and McClelland in the same year (1928), dem- onstrated the role of the rat louse (Polyplax spinulo- sus) in the transmission of the infectious anemia. Fi- nally, detailed study by the present author and others has failed to reveal any evidence of the multiplication of H. anuris in fixed tissue cells of the viscera. Thus have been established the essential characters of Haem1tobartonella mnuiris, type species of the genus: pathogenicity for animals of the same and related spe- cies; production of an anemia without cutaneous erup- tion or intra-endothelial multiplication; limitation of multiplication to the blood; efficacy of chemotherapy; and the all-important influence of splenectomy.</page><page sequence="51">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 291 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION Infected rats have been reported from all the conti- nents.2 The infection rate is very variable in these reports, and strains of white rats completely free of bartonellae are also widely distributed. For experi- mental purposes it is possible to render a strain parasite- free, by combined delousing and arsenical treatment (Mayer, 1928a, 1928b). THE ANEMIA INCUBATION PERIOD The incubation is calculated differently: by some authors counted from splenectomy to the appearance of symptoms, by others to the appearance of bartonellae in the blood. We shall use the term, except when otherwise stated, to mean the interval between the operation and first symptoms. The immediate effects of splenectomy are benign; a transitory slight increase in the blood values may be noted (Weinman, 1938). Three to five days is the usual incubation reported for splenectomized carrier rats, with extremes of one (Mayer. Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1927b) and thirteen days (Cannon and Mc- Clelland, 1929a). In parasite-free animals, splenec- tomized then inoculated, two to three weeks may elapse between infection and the appearance of parasites (see p. 300). Infection with Trypanosomia lewisi shortened the incubation period (Vogelsang and Gallo, 1939a). PERIOD OF ANEMIA The animal loses its appetite, becomes inactive, and loses weight rapidly-as much as 25 percent of the total weight in a few days (Lauda, 1930). At the be- ginning, pallor which rapidly increases is noted. The eyeballs from red become nearly colorless, the mu- cosae pale. The temperature may be slightly raised (Mayer et al., 1927b). Subnormal temperatures have also been reported; when between 320 and 340 C., the 2 Mayer et al. (1927) report 100 percent of the rats infected in Hamburg. Other infections found in Europe are those re- ported from: Pavia (Barbieri, 1931), Florence (Levi, 1930a), Milan (Cossali, 1932), Turin (Reitani, 1930d) Spain (Gomez, 1932); Vienna (Lauda, 1930);. Basle (Schmidt 1931) ; Berlin (Meyer, 1929), Frankfort (Haendel and Haagen, 1928); Mo- naco (Plaut, 1928) ; Holland (Vedder, 1928; Dinger, 1929b) Denmark (Alsted, 1933a); Cambridge, England (Bayon, 1928), Glasgow (McCluskie and Niven, 1934) ; in Russia, Leningrad, Saratow (Kolpakow, 1930), Smolensk (Judenic, 1931) ; Ru- mania (Vasiliu, 1929) ; Warsaw, Poland (Lawkowicz, 1938a). In the Americas: New York (Noguchi, 1928a), Chicago (Can- non, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt, 1928; Jaffe and Willis, 1928), Baltimore (Ford and Eliot, 1928a); Lima, Peru (Battistini and Weiss, 1926); Chile (Noe and Paez, 1930); Rio de Janeiro (Faria and Cruz, 1927); Caracas, Venezuela (Vogelsang and Gallo (1939a); Buenos Aires (Bacigalupo and Costa, 1932); Cuba (Perez, 1933). In the Near East, Asia, and Oceania: Jerusalem (Adler, 1930a); Cairo (Shousha and Aly, 1928); British India (McCarrison and Singh, 1931); Peking (Nauck, 1927); Keijo, Korea (Schin, 1930); Japan. (Amako, 1930a)- Dutch East Indies (Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930). hypothermia is of fatal prognosis (Colichon Arbulu, 1934). A slight conjunctivitis, often purpuric, may be noted. Toward the second day dyspnea appears; this increases, and the resultant tachypnea may reach 150 respirations per minute in place of the normal rate of about 50. The blood.3 -It rapidly become pale, watery, and of diminished viscosity. These changes, according to Lauda (1930), correspond not only to an oligocythemia but also to a true dilution of the blood. Occasionally, instantaneous coagulation occurs, rendering spread- making impossible (Schwarz, 1929). At times, usu- ally in the terminal phases, the blood appears laked or hemolyzed (Mayer et al., 1927b; Schwarz, 1929; Lauda, 1930; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Lettcocytes.-In general, the first microscopic change in the blood, coinciding with or even preceding symp- toms, is a marked leucocytosis noted by nearly all the investigators. The white count may attain 70,000 (Cannon, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt, 1928). The for- mula is marked by a dominant neutrophila, both abso- lute and relative: 21,000 of 40,000 white cells (Bayon, 1928) up to 50,000 (normal value 27 percent, Scar- borough).4 A monocytosis also, both absolute and relative, has been noted, and an inconstant eosinophilia reaching 6 to 8 percent (Schwarz, 1929). Hypolym- phocytosis may occur (Schwarz). Colichon Arbului (1934) reported a polymorphonuclear phase followed by a monocyte phase. The majority of authors report a left shift of Arneth's formula. Sorina (1929) noted hypersegmentation of the neutrophile nuclei, sometimes giving a rosettelike appearance and also pathological granulations in the cytoplasm, staining blue with methylene blue and fuchsin, and thought to indicate toxic action. The monocytes also often show signs of degeneration (Lauda) with altered nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm (Schwarz). Erythrophagocytosis in the circulating blood was noted by Domagk (1924) and subsequently by most authors. These erythrophages are large monocuclear cells of as yet unsettled origin. Domagk refers to them 3Normal hematological values.-Higgins and Stasney (1936a, 1936b) give the following for non-splenectomized rats of a carrier strain: red blood cells 9,200,000, hemoglobin 16.9 gm., platelets 960,000, erythrocyte diameter 6.09A, packed red cell volume 50.2 percent. Scarborough (1930) reports the average of the leucocyte counts, found in the literature, as 11,590, with the following formula: neutrophiles 27 percent, lymphocytes 67.9 percent, large mononuclears and transitionals 5.3 percent, eosinophiles 2.1 percent, basophiles 0.77 percent. The red blood count and hemoglobin estimation of bartonella- free rats is very slightly higher after splenectomy than before (Emery, Bugelski, and Schwabe, 1940). 4 The findings of Ford and Eliot (1928b) suggest that the leucocytosis may occur only in anemic rats which are splenecto- mized. It was not observed in infant rats with intact spleens which, after infection, developed marked clinical bartonellosis (p. 300), but did occur in young non-splenectomized rabbits with H. wuiris anemia (p. 301).</page><page sequence="52">292 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY as mobilized endothelial Kupifer cells, Battistini and Weiss (1926) as histiocytes of the blood, and Cannon, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt (1928) as monocytes. The last-named found them from the beginning and during all of the anemic period. Lauda (1930) noted them in 50 percent of the cases, Schwarz (1929) in only 10 percent. As many as 3 percent of all cells may be erythrophages (Lauda), and each such cell can contain as many as 12 erythrocytes (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). Levi (1931) observed erythrophagocytosis by neu- trophiles also. When erythrocyte regeneration begins, a notable polymorphism of the white cells has been described by Schwarz (1929). Many of the cells were difficult to classify, notably large cells with elongated cytoplasmic expansion; these he finally concluded were neither lymphocytes nor monocytes, but endothelial cells. Erythrocytes.-The count falls rapidly, in one or two days to 2.5 (Jaffe and Willis, 1928) or even to 1.5 millions (Bayon, 1928). Minimal values are reached one week after splenectomy, when the volume of packed cells falls to 17.8 percent (Higgins and Stasney, 1936a, 1936b). The prognosis is fatal when the count is be- low 1,000,000 (Mayer et al., 1927b) or 2,000,000 (Mc- Cluskie and Niven, 1934). Lauda (1930) reports a few unusual cases of polycythemia, thought to be due to a concentration of the blood through loss of fluid. Macrocytosis.-Increased cell size is characteristic of the anemia in the rat (Alsted, 1935). The average greatest diameter reaches 7.23u the seventh day after splenectomy and 7.52M the fourteenth day, whereas the normal value is 6.09M (Higgins and Stasney, 1936a, 1936b). Hemnoglobin.-In parallel fashion to the red cells, the blood pigment drops as low as 15 to 20 percent (Bayon, 1928), with a mean of 3 gm. seven days after operation (Higgins and Stasney, 1936). The color index is al- ways equal to or greater than 1, as in human pernicious anemia (Lauda, 1930). Levi (1930a) observed values between 1.10 and 1.25. Atypical cells.-The customary cellular abnormali- ties accompanying anemia with intense regeneration soon appear: anisocytosis with mi.cro- and megalocytes (Lauda, 1930), poikilocytosis and marked polychro- matophilia, nucleated erythrocytes with a predominance of normoblasts. Mayer et al. (1927b) report Cabot rings and semilunar bodies. A sharp increase in the normoblasts follows the red cell destruction and ini- tiates recovery (Ford and Eliot, 1928a; Jaffe and Willis, 1928). Howell-Jolly bodies are not increased (Schwarz) and are even less frequent than in the normal rat (Kikuth, 1932). Sorina (1929) reported Heinz's methemoglobinic bodies; V. Schilling (1929) reported Ehrlich's internal methemoglobinic body, which he considered patho- gnomonic of methemoglobin-producing intoxication; and McCluskie and Niven (1934) observed in the erythrocytes a notable increase of basophil bodies stain- ing with vital stains similarly to the inclusions seen in the toxic anemia due to phenylhydrazine. Reticulocytes.5-A marked increase in these cells has been noted (Lauda, 1930; Sorina, 1929; Joncheres, 1929); it begins on the fourth or fifth day after opera- tion, reaches 25 to 40 percent during the acute phase, and as much as 70 percent in the relapses (Perla and Rivero, 1933). An increase precedes each regenera- tive phase. In fatal cases a sharp fall, from a previ- ously high level, has been noted several days before death, whereas when recovery occurs, a gradual drop in the reticulocytes takes place about the tenth day after splenectomy, while the hemoglobin and total red count increase (Perla and Rivero, 1933). Fragility of the red cells.-Schwarz (1929) found the fragility markedly increased,6 whereas Lauda (1930) obtained readings within normal limits. Variability ac- cording to the period of the anemia was noted by Hoffenreich (1932a) with increased fragility early in the disease, whereas the "new generation" of red cells was more resistant. Blood platelets.-Thrombocytes are constantly and markedly increased in splenectomized aniimals (Mayer et al., 1927b; Noguchi, 1928a; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). They reach 1,530,000 per mM.3 the seventh day, slowly returning to normal in six weeks (Higgins and Stasney, 1936). Rachemilewicz found great varia- tions after the initial increase. Whether the thrombo- cytosis bears any relation to the infection remains to be determined. An increase in platelets is one of the regular sequels of splenectomy (Tocantins, 1938), and was not observed in unoperated anemic rats (Ford and Eliot, 1928b; see also p. 293). Blood chentistry.-Linton (1929) noted hypogly- cemia; Regendanz (1929) and Hoffenreich (1932b), a terminal hypoglycemia. The total titratable acidity is increased, and at such times hemoglobin crystals are deposited from the fresh blood (Levi, 1931). The non-protein nitrogen augments with the severity of the anemia: the total serum proteins, serum albumin and serum globulin, decrease slightly (Sandberg, Perla, and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1933). Uric acid and serum chlorides are unchanged, whereas total blood chlorides are increased. The totals of fats and fatty acids are in- creased; cholesterol, lipoid phosphorus, and lecithin are diminished. Acidosis was observed at the height of the infection. In the terminal stages with a hemoglo- bin content of 10 percent, both blood sugar and liver glycogen were markedly subnormal, possibly owing to the anorexia and subsequent inanition (Sandberg, Perla, and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1933). Lauda found the diazo-reaction, both direct and indirect, posi- 5 Normal values for adult rats: 1.7 to 4.8 percent (Perla and Rivero, 1933). 6 During periods of hemoglobinuria, hemolysis takes place in vitro in normal saline (Weinman, 1938, see p. 295).</page><page sequence="53">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 293 tive in the severe cases; Jirovec and Wenig (1935) found no significant change in the surface tension of the serum. The urine.-Free hemoglobin is found frequently, sometimes as early as the second day of illness. Forty percent of the affected animals may show this symp- tom, and the hemoglobin concentration in the urine may attain 50 percent of that present in the blood of the same animal (Weinman, 1938). Usually this symptom indicates a fatal outcome. The majority of the authors consider it to follow hemoglobinemia. Levi (1930b), however, believed it to follow intrarenal hemorrhage, whereas Marschall found no evidence of renal hemolysis (1936). The present author (1938), studying the pathogenesis of the anemia, noted that in cases of hemoglobinuria erythrocytolysis could be dem- onstrated in zitro (see p. 295). With the hemoglobinemia, hematuria may also be seen (Amako, 1930a, 1930b), or the latter may occur alone (Bayon, 1928). The parasite.-This, the essential diagnostic element, appears at a period which is variously estimated at from one to five days before the anemia. McCluskie and Niven (1934) noted them even before the leuco- cytosis, while Reiter (1928) observed anemia before parasites appeared. Attention has been called (M4ayer et al., 1927b) to the scarcity of parasites in the be- ginning and to the consequent ease with which they then may be overlooked. The bartonellae persist for seven to thirty-five days (McCluskie and Niven, 1934) and reach maximum numbers just before the terminal drop in red cells and hemoglobin (Perla and Rivero, 1933). They vary in number inversely with the young and nucleated cells (Kikuth, 1932). Rordorff (1933) considers the high number of parasites a better indication of severity than the degree of hematological change. Unexpectedly enough, shortly before death, a crisis frequently occurs and all, or almost all, the parasites disappear. This was noted by Mayer et al. (1927b) and has since been frequently confirmed. When recovery takes place, parasites usually disappear gradually (McCluskie and Niven, 1934). The morphology and biology of the parasite will be described later (p. 297). EVOLUTION The duration of the anemic period is variable. In fatal cases death may occur five days after splenectomy (Adler, 1930a) or as late as fourteen days (Mayer et al., 1927b). In favorable cases the anemia and the bartonellae usually recede gradually. The blood re- turns to normal in four weeks (Ford and Eliot, 1928b), or in two and a half months (Gomez, 1932). The mortality is likewise variable. Figures in the literature are not comparable, since some give the mortality for the total of splenectomized animals, others for anemic rats, still others for artificially infected animals. Obvi- ously, mortality percentages based on a total of sple- nectomized animals alone is of dubious significance unless at least it is also stated what percentage of ani- mals were parasite-free. Lauda found, in anemic rats, a mortality of 70 percent. In infected animals the mor- tality varies from 30 to 40 percent (Mayer et al., 1927b) to 80 percent (Roth, 1932). ATYPICAL FORMS Several varieties exist. Lauda (1930) described both a fulminating type killing in less than 24 hours, and a mild one where symptoms were minimal and the anemia was only slightly marked and temporary. Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) found, in most mild cases, only few bartonellae temporarily present, but sometimes the parasites were abundant despite lack of clinical or hematological disturbance. Bayon (1928) described a mild but prolonged type with slight and stationary anemia. In adult, non-splenectomized rats, several authors, following Mayer et al., have noted bartonellae in the blood of some animals (up to 10 percent (Roth, 1932; Fujisawa and Nugusi, 1932)), but they were always few and produced no clinical or hematological dis- turbance. Bartonellosis in non-splenectomized rats, subjected to additional infections, intoxications, etc., will be discussed later (p. 306). In the young non-splenectomized rat, bartonellae are numerous from the fourth to the fifth week (Jaffe' and Willis, 1928). This has been confirmed by Schin (1930) and Bergel and Flaum (1931). Kikuth (1932) found them as early as the fifteenth day. Only Mc- Carrison and Singh (1931) noted them immediately after birth. According to the above authors, the transitory ane- mia of young non-splenectomized rats is accompanied by neither symptoms nor anemia. Different results after inoculation were reported by Ford and Eliot (1928b). Rats weighing 20 to 30 grams and less than three weeks old sometimes developed an anemia, with an occasional death. There was no leucocytosis nor increase in the platelet count. Rats weighing 60 gm. were very nearly as resistant as adults. RELAPSES Noted by Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b), relapses have been reported by almost all investigators. McCluskie and Niven (1934) found them in every case which survived the first attack, if the observation period was as long as five months. Clinical and hematological features are in general those of the original attack, but in any given animal there is no relation between the characters of the first and those of subsequent attacks, or between two succeeding relapses. The free interval between two attacks, during which bartonellae are scarce in the blood, is on the average 17 to 18 days</page><page sequence="54">294 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY (Schwarz, 1929), with extremes of 8 days (V. Schil- ling, 1929) to several weeks (Mayer et al., 1927b); and the number of relapses varies from one to four (McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Pregnancy may occa- sion a relapse (McGarrison and Singh, 1931), as may injections of trypan blue (Gomez, 1932), but outside of these facts the causes are unknown. PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY ACUTE- PHASE At the height of the anemia, the mucosae and viscera are pale; a subicteric or even frankly icteric tinge of the subcutaneous tissue and of the viscera has been noted (Mayer et al., 1927b; Schwarz, 1929; Lauda, 1930; Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1931). The intestine is filled with bilious liquid and shows marked congestion (Cannon, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt, 1928; Schwarz, 1929). Liquid may occur in the pleura, peri- toneum, and pericardium (Perla and Marmorston- Gottesman, 1931), and the membranes themselves may be icteric. Levi (1930b) reports disseminated small hemorrhages in various organs. Liver.-Increased in size, soft, friable, and pale yel- low, the liver may show a yellow speckling under the capsule. Microscopically, all investigators have re- ported multiple foci of necrosis, a diffuse increased fatty content of the hepatic cells, and a proliferation, swelling, and mobilization of the Kupffer cells, which contain numerous red cells and iron pigment. This endothelial reaction is insular, according to Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1931), and coincides with the foci of necrosis. The latter they consider secondary to compression by the Kupffer cells, which may be so swollen as to obliterate the capillaries. Consistent with this view are the observations of Schwarz, who noted that the endothelial reaction was predominant in the centro-lobular region, while McCluskie and Niven found the same topography for the necrosis. An alter- native explanation follows from the observations of Rich, who has noted that hepatic central necroses follow severe anemias of various types as well as, apparently, any cause of anoxemia if sufficiently severe and pro- longed (see also chapter I, p. 259). Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) noted a leucocytic infiltrate asso- ciated with the necrosis; this was not found by Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1931). During relapses the lesions are more intense and extended, hemorrhages are frequent, the hepatic cells are hypertrophied, and sometimes there may be a peri- portal collection of mycloid cells (McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Kidney.-When hemoglobinuria has occurred, the kidney is blackish-red, otherwise pale and swollen (Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1931). Mayer et al. (1927b) and Levi (1930b) found punctiform hemorrhages. Microscopically, Cannon, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt (1928) remarked an infiltration with neutral fat. Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1931) noted scattered zones of glomerular necrosis, more rarely proliferation of the glomerular endothelium; the convoluted tubules, in cases showing hemoglobinuria, were extensively involved, with marked necrotic lesions and desquamation of the epithelium, sometimes with intracellular yellow pigment; the collecting tubules showed fatty infiltration. McCluskie and Niven (1934) found granular thrombi in the glomeruli associated with a polymorphonuclear infiltration. The convoluted tubes were dilated by hemoglobin and had a swollen granular epithelium sometimes containing iron pigment. Levi (1930b) noted numerous intrarenal hemor- rhages in rats showing hemoglobinuria; these were sub- capsular, interstitial, and intratubular. This author believes that such extravasation, followed by blood passing into the urine, accounts, in part, for the hemo- globinuria. It would certainly seem an explanation of the hematuria. Marschall (1936) believes that hemoglobin is first dissolved in the plasma, then passes through the convoluted tubules to appear in the urine. Lungs.-Punctiform hemorrhages and less often foci of broncho-pneumonia (Mayer et al., 1927b), small abscesses with central necrosis and alveolitis marked by exudation and desquamation (Perla and Marmorston- Gottesman, 1931), and a marked histiocytic reaction (Levi, 1930b), have all been described. These lesions must have been difficult to distinguish from those due to the common, spontaneous lung disease (broncho- pneumonia) of laboratory rats. Domagk (1924) de- scribed emboli of endothelial erythrophagocytic cells, coming from mobilized Kupffer cells. Such emboli were said sometimes to pass through the lung, lodge in some other organ, and frequently be the cause of death. Heart.-Infiltration of the myocardium with intra- cellular fat, the quantity of which varied directly with the intensity of the anemia, was noted, but no inflam- matory reaction (Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1931). Adrenals.-These are unaffected (McCluskie and Niven, 1934) or show only cloudy swelling in the cor- tex (Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1931). Spleen.-Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1931) studied this organ in inoculated immature rats. In the animals which died of anemia the spleen was soft and swollen, the red pulp appeared pale. The sinuses were distended, and the lining cells were swollen and con- tained numerous parasitized red cells with bartonellae; later focal necrosis took place. In rats which survived longer the phagocytes con- tained abundant red cells and pigment. The follicles were hyperplastic with multiplication of both the lymphoblasts and reticulum cells. Hemolymph nodes.-According to McCluskie and Niven (1934), these show "catarrh" of the sinus endo- thelium, which contained pigment and red cells. Thymnus.-Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1931) reported an atrophy of the lymphocytes and foci of</page><page sequence="55">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 295 necrosis in the medulla, while near by the endothelium was, in spots, swollen, proliferated, and desquamated to such an extent as to obliterate certain of the capil- laries. McCluskie and Niven did not find these lesions. Lymiph nodes and Peyer's patches.-Mayer, Borch- ardt, and Kikuth (1927b) noted hypertrophy, while Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman found the endothe- lium to be proliferated, at times forming several layers and obliterating the sinuses. Bone marrow.-Active regeneration and erythro- phagocytosis were remarked by Cannon, Taliaferro, and Dragstedt (1927), Perla and Marmorston- Gottesman (1931), and McCluskie and Niven (1934). Kolpakow and Schmidt (1929) also report great num- bers of platelets. The polymorphonuclears are, however, markedly diminished according to Levi (1931), and Higgins and Stasney (1936a; 1936b) report a reduction in the per- centage of granulocytes during the entire period of anemia. This is somewhat unexpected, since marked hematic leucocytosis is habitual during the disease (see p. 291). Higgins and Stasney (1936b) consider it probable that the medullary granulocytes show an abso- lute increase. The same authors studied the relation- ship of the different cell types. Normally, in non- splenectomized rats, the myeloid cells predominate over the erythroid, and the ratio is: in the femur, 1.75: 1.00; in the rib, 1.40: 1.00. One week after sple- nectomy the ratio was inversed, being 0.88: 1.00 in the femur and 0.72: 1.00 in the rib. The relative per- centage of megakaryocytes was not significantly changed despite marked thrombocytosis in the periph- eral blood (Higgins and Stasney, 1936b). LATER PHASES Sometime after the initial anemia the histological findings are marked by a reticulo-histiocytic reaction particularly marked in the liver and lung (Levi, 1930b). Survival itself is due to this reaction, Levi feels, which in some manner furnishes a substitute for the splenic function. Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1931a) studied infected rats three to five months after splenectomy and found a hyperplasia of the reticulo-endothelial system which was particularly marked in the lymphatic organs. The hemolymph glands were regularly increased in size, and both endothelial and reticular cells were distended by red cells and hemosiderin. The lymph glands, less constantly, showed hyperplasia of the sinus endothe- lium, which sometimes was transformed into solid sheets of cells. Regeneration of the thymus impressed these authors. In six- and eight-months-old rats this organ was of the same size as in immature animals. Regeneration of the reticulum was more marked than of the small cells; occasionally the lymphoid follicles were hyperplastic. In the liver, the Kupffer and paren- chymal cells had returned to normal; scattered groups of lymphocytes were formed in the periportal regions. In the lungs, these authors found peribronchial collec- tions of lymphocytes and gianit cells. McCluskie and Niven (1934) confirmed the increased hematopoiesis of the bone marrow, not the hyperplasia of the reticular tissues of the hemolymph glands, nor the lymphocytic collections in the lung and liver. In the latter organ they did find small fibrous nodules, a slight hypertrophy of the hepatic cells and periportal zones of myeloid cells. DURING LATENT INFECTION Even before the discovery of the parasite, the spleen was studied by Wolferth (1917), who noted that the spleens of those rats dying of anemia after splenectomy were heavier than those of animals which remained well. Cannon and McClelland (1929b) confirmed this finding and gave the following ratios for the weight of the spleen to the total body weight: 0.25 percent in bartonella-free rats, 0.74 percent in carriers. Tali- aferro, Cannon, and Goodloe (1931) obtained analo- gous figures (0.253 percent and 0.652 percent). His- tologically, Cannon and McClelland (1929b) noted large follicles with numerous mitoses in the germinating cen- ters, and the marginal zone thick; Lauda and Rezek (1930), a marked proliferation of the reticulo-endo- thelial tissue which did not exist in guinea pigs or rab- bits; and Dinger (1929b), phagocytosis of red cells and of pigment which he did not find in non-carriers. Finally, Colichon Arbulu' (1934) studied all the skin nodules which he encountered in splenectomized or in unoperated rats. He states that they shoulcl all be at- tributed to other causes than H. muris. PATHOGENESIS Marked erythrocytic regeneration with a high reticu- locyte count has, from the beginning, oriented searcl towards a cause of blood destruction rather than an impediment to erythrocyte production. Domagk (1924) originally believed erythrophagocytosis to be this cause; then later (Domagk and Kikuth, 1933) he concluded that it was secondary, and a manifestation rather than a cause of the anemia. Adler (1930b) looked for serum hemolysins in the blood of rats showing hemoglobinuria and hemoglo- binemia. None were found, even in a 1: 1 dilution when added to a 5 percent suspension of normal rat erythrocytes either at 370 or at room temperature. Weinman (1938) also found no serum hemolysins for normal rat red cells either by the techniques employed by Adler or by the Donath-Landsteiner chilling-warm- ing method. Nonetheless, the hemoglobinuria strongly suggested prior erythrocytolysis. Since in the blood of anemic rats it was apparently not the serum which was hemo- lytic, Weinman (1938) then sought the cause of lysis in red cells washed free of serum. Blood was with-</page><page sequence="56">296 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY drawni during different periods of the anemia, serum was removed from the red cells, and the latter were washed three times in fresh changes of saline. The resuspended cells were then placed at 80 C. and at 370 C. At both temperatures in vitro hemolysis could be demonstrated, and was more marked at body tempera- ture. First visible several hours after resuspension, hemolysis increased as time elapsed. If we take 100 percent as the normal blood hemoglobin, as much as 59 percent of hemoglobin was freed in 19 hours at 80 C. This in vitro hemolysis was not due to any peculiar reaction to the suspending medium, for suspension in autologous serum gave similar results. This reaction was observed only during the anemia, and since it also took place in serum suspensions at 37? C.. it was considered to be analogous to the anematiz- ing process taking place in vivo. Neither splenectomy alone, nor infection alone, nor even splenectomy com- bined with infection in the carrier state sufficed to pro- duce in vitro hemolysis. Thus the cause of the lysis resided in the washed erythrocytes themselves. In considering the elements involved in this reaction, although it is known that no hemolytic substances have ever been demonstrated in the serum or plasma of anemic rats, failure to demon- strate such substances does not prove them to be absent. Accordingly, a portion of the experiment was so devised as to exclude in so far as possible the action of any such substances. Thus the triple wash in saline, fol- lowed by incubation at 80 C., furnishes conditions most unfavorable for serum hemolysis. Nevertheless hemo- lysis did take place. Therefore, under these circum- stances at least, constituents of the serum were in all probability not active, and the parasite was the only apparent responsible factor, being present on the red cells at times of lysis and absent at all other times. In addition, morphological study showed that: (1) parasitized red cells were particularly fragile, often ruptured, and frequently deformed with parasites lo- cated at the point of deformation, suggesting local struc- tural weakness; and (2) completely dehemoglobinized cells almost invariably contained parasites. These find- ings indicated that the parasitized red cells were the more fragile as well as the more dehemoglobinized ones, a condition easily understood since the red cell mem- brane must undergo some alteration to permit hemo- globin diffusion. It further appeared that this altera- tion very probably took place by direct action of H. muris on the red cell.7 Pittaluga (1938) is in accord with the above explanation and suggests that the para- sites dissolve the lipoid constituents of the red cell membrane, which action is then followed by diffusion of hemoglobin. 7 This local action may involve a lysin of restricted action, analogous perhaps to the endotoxins of certain bacteria. PROTISTOLOGY DEFINITION Haemnobartonellca muris (Mayer, 1921), the type species of the genus, possesses all of the generic char- acters, and has previously been defined (pp. 289-290). HABITAT The natural source of H. muris is: among mammals, the albino rat and possibly other rodents (p. 289); among invertebrates, the transnmitting insects. The locus of occurrence of the parasite in the mammalian host is the parasitized red cell; it may also be seen free in the plasma, then often in groups, many times surrounded by, or adjacent to, the remnants of ex- tremely pale-staining erythrocytes. In leucocytes and fixed phagocytes, parasitized red blood cells are not uncommon. Extrahematic localization.-Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) saw in different viscera, particularly the bone marrow, bartonellalike inclusioins which they also found in control noi-splenectomized animals. They concluded that these inclusions were not bar- tonellae; however, their "control" animals were prob- ably all of them infected, since these authors reported an enzodtic rate of 100 percent. Noguchi (1928a) studied the bone marrow of anemic rats, and speaks, prudently, of bartonelliform inclusions which he ob- served there. The present author reviewed the problem in some detail, utilizing sections and impression films from con- trol parasite-free animals for comparison with anemic and latently infected rats. In no instance was con- spicuous massive growth in vascular endothelial cells, which is the distinctive pathological feature of Barton- ella bacilliformis in the human Oroya fever anemia, observed in Haemobartonella inuiris infections. In anemic rats endothelial cells were actively phagocytic; such bartonellae as were no longer on red cells could not be identified with certainty and gave no evidence of development. Likewise, in latently infected animals no extra-erythrocytic growth was noted. Battistini and Weiss (1926) reported the presence of parasites in endothelial cells of the spleen, as did Dinger (1929b) in latently infected, but not in para- site-free, animals. Faria and Cruz (1926) studied sections fixed in Schaudinn's mixture, where certain structures which did not stain with Giemsa's fluid were demonstrated with iron hemotoxylin and considered to be bartonellae. These bodies were rod-shaped with enlarged and deeply stained extremities and were en- countered in* the liver capillaries, in Kupffer and in hepatic cells, in lung capillaries, pulmonary macro- phages, and alveoli. The sections chosen for illustra- tion show from one to twenty, usually a few, structures within liver cells. It is unfortunate that on the one hand the bodies did not stain in sections with Giemsa's fluid, and on the other, that the authors do not specify</page><page sequence="57">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 297 that in the hematoxylin sections known bartonellae on the erythrocytes were also stained. There is thus some doubt whether the described structures were bartonellae at all; if so, they do not seem to have multiplied. In blood-tinged urine, Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) found parasites. Also the urine may be in- fectious (p. 300). Finally, Haemobartonella muris has not yet been seen in a vector: louse, flea, or acarian. MORPHOLOGY The original description is that of Mayer and Zeiss (1920), completed by Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b). Later accounts do not differ much from these, at least in regard to the common forms encount- ered during the anemia (Battistini and Weiss, 1926; Ford and Eliot, 1928b; Schilling and San Martin, 1928; Dinger, 1929b; Reitani, 1930d; Lauda, 1930; Schwetz, 1933; Rordorff, 1933; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). The organisms appear as slender rods with rounded ends, frequently showing granules or swellings at one or both extremities, and as dumbbell, coccoid, or dip- lococcoid forms. Parasites may occur individually, be paired, or form short chains of three or four elements, and when they are abundant, parallel grouping has been noted. The rods measure 0.7,u X 0.1Xx (Mayer et al., 1927); 1.3,u X U.1p (Bayon, 1928); as much as half the length of a red cell (McCluskie and Niven, 1934). The coc- coids have a diameter of 0.1, to 0.2,u. Concerning visibility in the fresh state and motility, there is lack of agreement. Mayer et al. (1927b) re- port that either by dark-field or ordinary illumination they found only dots, and that these were too few to correspond to the number of stained parasites. Ford and Eliot (1928b) saw nothing suggestive by direct lighting either in hanging drops or unstained films; in the dark-field, motionless parasites were visible. Din- ger (1929b) saw them in the dark-field animated by Brownian movement; Lauda (1930) under the same condition, motionless; Bayon (1928) and Perez (1933) reported slow and sinuous motion in the red cell; Noe and Paez (1930) and Rordoff (1933), rapid motion. Sorina (1929) called attention to rodlike and granular structures visible in the dark-field in the red cells of anemic rats, which were considered to be due to col- loidal changes in the red cell subsequent to hemolysis and not to the presence of parasites. Levi (1931) in dark-field preparations observed innumerable refractile granules, the majority free in the plasma, which showed during 5 to 10 minutes lively motion, not of a Brownian type, and then became quiescent. The preferred stains are those derived from the Romanowsky. With Giemsa's fluid, Mayer et al. (1927b) obtained an intense red color, Judenic (1931) a bluish tinge with pink shadings. Jaffe and Willis (1928) used a slightly alkaline Giemsa, followed by rapid differentiation in 1 percent sodium carbonate; the "polar granules" stained purple, the rest blue. The Leishman gives an intense purple (Bayon, 1928); the Wright, a bluish tint "with a suggestion of redder granules at the ends" (Ford and Eliot, 1928b); Schil- ling's methylene blue - eosin, a bright red color, the erythrocyte staining blue (Rordorff, 1933). They are faintly stained with the Manson, pyronin - methyl green, and fuchsin stains (Mayer et al., 1927b). Ford and Eliot (1928b), Dinger, and Noguchi (1928a) also find staining with fuchsin faint; the last named noted that with it Bartonella bacilliformis had a deeper color. All reports concur that they are not stained violet by Gram's method. Vital stains (cresyl blue, neutral red, Nile blue, Janus green) stain the reticulum but not the parasites (Mayer et al., 1927b; Ford and Eliot, 1928b; Lauda, 1930; Perla and Rivero, 1933; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Dinger (1929b), however, reports that the bartonellae stained early with cresyl blue, the reticulum becoming apparent later. Situation.-H. muris is an erythrocytic parasite of- ten showing a marked preference for normal ortho- chromatophile cells. At times, above all at the end of the anemic period and in the fatal cases, they may occur in the plasma, either singly or, more often, in small groups which appear to result rather from the disintegration of erythrocytes than from multiplication in the plasma. They are epi-erythrocytic only, for Mayer, Borch- ardt, and Kikuth (1927b), Jaffe and Willis (1928), Lauda (1930), and McCluskie and Niven (1934) found them both on and in the cells; Judenic (1931) and Lawkowicz (1938a), within the erythrocytes.. Bayon (1928) found them on the surface of normocytes, in the interior of pale and bluish cells. Evolution.-Most authors have noted the relative morphological uniformity of the first parasites which appear after splenectomy, or those rare elements which are seen in unoperated animals. After this, the para- sites appear to divide transversely to constitute chains and clumps. Here agreement ceases. Vasiliu (1929) describes as early forms granulations which are so fine as to be visible only with difficulty. Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) find the early forms to. be dumbbell- shaped or diplococcoids; these are followed by chain formation. Just before the crisis during which they will disappear, the bartonellae occur as small, pale gran- ules found in a dense mass on a segment of the red cell or even in the plasma. Dinger (1929b) also noted a predominance of rods in the early stages, delicate coc- coids later. Lauda and Markus (1927) add that the diplococcoids are often flame-shaped, the rounded bases nearly in contact, the pointed ends free. Jaffe and Willis (1928) describe transition forms between the dumbbells and the rods.</page><page sequence="58">298 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Ford and Eliot (1928b) find four successive stages: (1) Thick short forms, often diplococcoids; these ele- ments occur singly and only on an occasional cell. (2) Rods, dumbbell-shaped, granular, or long and slen- der; two to four on an erythrocyte; more cells infected. (3) -Shorter rods, often in parallel rows and in chains, several to a dozen organisms per cell; majority of cells infected. (4) Between the fifth and tenth day after splenectomy a sudden disappearance of infected cells; those remaining reveal larger, deeply-staining, very polymorphous bodies with occasional peculiar prolongations of the cytoplasm; ring forms may also occur and be thicker and more deeply stained on one side. Adult non-splenectomized and non-infected rats inoculated with heavy doses of infected blood show, after two or three days, a few rods which are always sparsely distributed, then disappear suddenly, leaving the polymorphous bodies "involution forms," which in their turn disappear (Ford and Eliot, 1930a). VIABILITY, CULTIVATION, AND FILTERABILITY Viabilitv.-After 24 hours at room temperature or at 370, infectiousness is lost; in the refrigerator, it is at- tenuated (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). Alsted (1938) found slightly longer survival; after 24 hours at 20? C. the incubation period was lengthened but the disease was just as severe. After 24 hours at 370 C. or 5 minutes at 56? C., the blood infected only one of three rats, but each of these animals died; he concluded that the virulence per se was unchanged but the number of organisms diminished by the treatment. Reitani (1929a, 1929b) at 40 C. recorded 15 days' survival in citrated blood, and Kessler (1942), that frozen de- fibrinated blood maintained at the temperature of solid carbon dioxide retains infectivity for at least 11 weeks with no lowering of the deathrate of the inoculated animals. Cultivation.-Extraordinarily divergent results are reported by different investigators. Like the other haemobartonellae, H. muris is a difficult organism to grow. Interpretation of recorded results is compli- cated by the fact that the rat may frequently have other cultivable organisms circulating in the blood (salmo- nellae), that in many cases in proving the cultures the authors have not made certain that the test animals were bartonella-free, and that bartonellalike organisms when isolated have shown little or no pathogenicity for animals; a result which has been attributed to a loss in virulence. Concerning the last point, Tyzzer (1941b) has re- cently demonstrated. that Grahacmellat, an erythrocytic parasite found in rodents and closely resembling the haemobartonellae in morphology, but non-pathogenic, may be easily cultivated on semi-solid serum agar, and that the culture forms also bear striking resemblance to the haemobartonellae. While the species described as Grahamella muris is not yet known to have been cultivated, it would probably grow with the same ease as the other species. Possibly, therefore, certain cul- tures, apparently of H. miuris, may in reality be consti- tuted by G. mtris. Results obtained in recent years indicate that the haemobartonellae when obtained in culture are strik- ingly similar in both macroscopic and microscopic ap- pearance. If, therefore, an organism isolated from the rat and said to be H. niuris is quite different in appear- ance from the other members of the genus, a consider- able degree of cautioni should attach to this identifica- tion and only unequivocal results of animal inoculation would prove the contention. Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1926) were the first to have any degree of apparent success in cultivating the organism. It is interesting to note that Kikuth, twelve years later, is of the reported opinion that H. muris cannot be cultivated (in Pittaluga, 1938). A list of the media with which some degree of growth has been obtained is given below: T. Blood agar. A. Abundant colonies of a coccoid organism which V. Schilling and San Martin (1928) at first believed to be a contaminant. Inoculation of normal or splenec- tomized rats was followed by early death. In the blood, cocci were seen first, then typical bartonellae. The authors concluded that the form in culture was not a contaminant, but some peculiar form of H. muris. They do not state, however, whether their rats were latently infected or not; thus there is an alternative explanation (see p. 306). B. Growth in 48 hours of the organism isolated by Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932b) in semi- solid serum agar (see IX D). C. Microscopic growth in the condensation water in 7 of 32 tubes in four days at 250 C. Not viable after the second transfer. Parasite-free animals were in- oculated with the condensation fluid with the follow- ing results: first transfer, two of three animals in- fected; second transfer, one of six; third transfer, no one of six (Rordorff, 1932). D. Negative, however, another organism, Bacterium nurium, quite regularly obtained (Noguchi, 1928a). E. Positive after isolation and a few transfers on semi- solid medium; growth visible after 48 hours at 25? to 260; pathogenicity decreases after several months (Lawkowicz, 1938a). II. Agar with 2 percent defibrinated rat blood. Slight growth in condensation fluid was obtained once by Dinger (1929b). III. Horse blood glucose agar. A. Microscopic growth only, obtained in five to ten days at 300 or 370. Third transfer unsuccessful, in- oculation results negative. (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1926.) B. No growth either in anaerobiasis or under aerobic conditions (Judenic, 1931).</page><page sequence="59">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 299 IV. N. N. N. A. Growth after three days at 370 C. Non-infectious for the splenectomized parasite-free rat (Haam, Lauda, and Sorge, 1927). B. Slight growth; transfers not successful (Metelkin, 1928). V. "Blutr6splatte" of Wethmar. Slight growth in two to three days at 370 (H. Meyer, 1929). VI. "Hormone" agar with blood of rabbit, horse, or man. Growth when transferred from Noguchi's medium (Mar- morston-Gottesman and Perla, 1932b). VII. Ascitic fluid agar. Growth after culture on Noguchi's medium or blood agar and passage through the rat (Marmorston-Gottes- man and Perla, 1932b; see comment IX D). VIII. Chocolate agar. Growth visible after 48 hours at 250 to 260 of strains isolated and subcultured on modified semi-solid medium (vide infra: X). Rapidly loses pathogenicity, which is restored after several passages on semi-solid medium. At 370, long wavy threads were found which, when stained with Giemsa's fluid, show bluish-stained ecto- plasm and an internal "metachromatic" substance, some- times in the form of granules (Lawkowicz, 1939). IX. Semi-solid rabbit serum agar.8 A. Microscopic growth; subcultures and inoculations negative (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1926). B. Battistini and Weiss (1926) report growth in pure culture, utilizing a technique stated to be previously employed by one of them (it is here assumed that semi-solid rabbit serum agar was used). They note a marked similarity to B. bacilliformis in macroscopic growth and microscopically in the grouping of the organisms. Results of animal inoculation and of serial transfer are not given. It was difficult to ob- tain pure cultures, owing to the regular presence in the blood of an organism of the salmonella group. C. Slight growth, "similar to that of Mayer"; inocula- tions were negative (H. Meyer, 1929). D. Growth obtained only twice in many attempted iso- lations (Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla, 1932b). Macroscopically, a fine cloud developed in the upper portion of the medium after 10 to 12 days at 250 C., after two subcultures growth was obtained on blood agar (see I B). The authors refer to the isolated organism as B. muris. The illustrations, however, show an organism considerably coarser than the other cultivated haemobartonellae. After inoculation of splenectomized rats of a non-carrier strain, only in three of ten animals were parasites "occasionally seen on red cells," and anemic changes were simularly in- constant. In the light of present knowledge this evidence is not altogether convincing. E. Two strains isolated after numerous failures (Law- kowicz, 1938a). Growth was observed between the sixth and twelfth days. The characteristics of these strains are said to resemble those of strains described above (IX D), and the morphology of the organisms is said to be identical with the blood forms. The optimal temperature was 250 to 260 C.; subcultures 8 Authors sometimes refer to this medium as Noguchi's lepto- spira medium. More than one formula of this name exists. It is usually apparent that the medium used by Noguchi and Battistini for the cultivation of Bartontella bacilliformis was the one employed. were made after four months at room temperature, longer in the refrigerator. After several subcultures, the organisms grew on blood agar, but pathogenicity was better retained on semi-solid medium. Strains of unspecified age were injected into splenectomized bartonella-free rats producing a marked bartonellosis and notable anemia (figures of 1,017,000 red blood cells and 32 percent hemoglobin are given). F. Negative results were reported by Haam, Lauda, and Sorge (1927), Noguchi (1928a), Ford and Eliot (1928b), Metelkin (1928), Schilling (1929), and Mc- Cluskie and Niven (1934). X. Semi-solid rabbit blood agar (modified formula).9 Growth was obtained from the sixth to the twelfth day (Lawkowicz, 1938b; 1939). The optimum temperature was stated to be 250 to 260. The organisms were Gram- negative, non-motile, and viable for six months at room temperature, longer at about 100 C. Subcultures were obtained from dried ten-month-old cultures. After several transfers, the organism grew on chocolate agar. Two principal morphological types were described: (1) minute cocci, sometimes "on the border-line of visi- bility"; (2) delicate rods mainly arranged in charac- acteristic clusters. One strain showed no clustering. XI. Noguchi-Wenyon. Bayon (1928) planted bits of liver tissue and once ob- tained growth; subcultures were negative. XII. Defibrinated rat blood. At 370 Dinger (1929b) obtained "multiplication of bar- tonellae"; however, he considered the results unsatisfac- tory. XIII. Glucose broth. A. Growth of the organism isolated on semi-solid medium (Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla, 1932b). B. No growth (C. Schilling and Neumann, 1929). XIV. Tarozzi broth. Subcultures rapidly became negative, "positive" results in a splenectomized rat which had survived the anemia (Cossali, 1932). We have already noted (p. 293) that spontaneous relapses are a feature of the disease. XV. Peptone water. Light, diffuse growth giving slight cloudiness, beginning the first day and maximal the second or third day. Never more than three subcultures. Inoculation of the first subculture to two rats which were perhaps parasite-free was "positive"; of the second, to a splenectomized rat surely parasite-free, feebly positive (H. Meyer, 1929). To summarize the above accounts, it seems that none of the reports of cultivation are completely satisfactory. Lawkowicz has presented the most convincing data, since the organism isolated by him was infectious for the bartonella-free splenectomized rat, producing both marked anemia and visible bartonellae in the blood. However, in the pathogenicity test, no information is provided which definitely excluded the possibility of survival of viable organisms from the original inoculum. The nature of the parasite earlier cultivated by Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932b) still re- 9 Formula: Sterilized tap water ....... ...... 80 cc. Defibrinated rabbit blood ......... 3 cc.

A list of additional media which have given no success whatsoever will be found in an earlier publication of the author (Weinman, 1935). Tissue cultures, embryonated eggs.-No conclusive results were obtained from tissue cultures of blood or organs from infected animals (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). Embryonated chicken eggs proved satisfactory to Vogel- sang and Gallo (1939b) . Infected blood was placed on the chorio-allantoic membrane of 9- to 12-day-old eggs, which were then incubated at an unspecified tempera- ture. Twenty-four and 48 hours later, the embryos were alive and bartonellae were reported in the blood, chorio-allantoic and amniotic membranes. At 72 hours the distribution was the same; one-half of the chickens were dead. At 96 hours more than half were dead; of the living, some contained the organisms, others did not. At 5 and 6 days, all parasitized eggs were dead, all eggs without parasites were living. The organisms were scarce in the membranes; in the blood, intra- and extracellular forms were reported. Four splenecto- mized, arsenic-treated rats received egg material and died 5 to 8 days later, showing bartonellae in the blood. Control arsenic-treated rats showed no bartonellae after splenectomy. Filtration.-Results have been uniformly negative when Seitz or Berkefeld N filters were employed. Citrated blood, hemolyzed by distilled water, or liver suspension fluid are infective; their filtrates no longer so (Lauda, 1930; Mayer et al., 1927b; Cannon and McClelland, 1929a; Dinger, 1929b; Sorge, 1929b, 1929c; Reitani, 1930d). There is thus no apparent justification for stating that the "filterability of [H. muris] has been established" (McKinley, 1935). EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION An infective inoculum may be made from blood and liver suspension (Lauda, 1925b) or from defibrinated laked blood (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1927b). Washed red cells are infective, as was plasma removed from the same blood, but only after a lengthened incu- bation period (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). Hemoglobi- nuric urine may also be infective (Perla and Marmor- ston-Gottesman, 1931). The route of inoculation gives similar results, whether subcutaneous, intracardiac, or intraperitoneal; whereas the oral route has not produced infection (Eliot and Ford, 1929). The infective dose may be very small, and 0.1 mm.3 suffices to infect the splenectomized bartonella-free rat. Larger doses (0.05 cm.3) are required to infect young unoperated rats (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). As source, the carrier rat furnishes infectious blood for as long a period as 13 months (Eliot and Ford, 1932), and probably throughout life. After splenec- tomy, blood remains infective for a variable period; from 10 weeks (Eliot and Ford, 1932) to 8 months (Alsted, 1938), but sooner or later parasites disappear completely. Inoculations of a variety of animals have been made. We shall consider successively six groups: (I) the adult splenectomized bartonella-free white rat; (II) the young non-splenectomized bartonella-free white rat; (III) the adult non-splenectomized bartonella-free white rat; (IV) the adult non-splenectomized white rat of carrier stock; (V) the adult splenectomized white rat after recovery from the anemia; (VI) other (non- albino) rats and other animals. I. Adult splenectomtized bartonella-free albino rats.- The disease which occurs in splenectomized infected rats is reproduced (Lauda, 1925b; Sorge, 1926; etc.). The incubation period may be prolonged if splenectomy has taken place months previously (Weinman, unpub- lished), but the outcome of the disease is unchanged even after an interval of 12 months (Kikuth, 1932). II. Young non-splenectomized bartonella-free albino rats.-Animals weighing 20 to 30 grams at three weeks may develop a marked bartonellosis leading to anemia and terminating fatally. The only peculiarity of the blood picture is the absence of leucocytosis and throm- bocytosis. In somewhat older rats weighing 60 grams, inoculation was usually without effect (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). C. Schilling and Neumann (1929) inoculated rats aged 5 to 7 days, and obtained in 27 of 28 cases a transitory appearance of bartonellae with moderate anemia after an incubation period of 5 to 7 days. III. Adult non-splenectomized bartonella-free albino rats.-Meyer (1929) and Eliot and Ford (1932) re- port a slight bartonellosis, usually transient without any anemia. Upon subsequent splenectomy, the typical disease develops (Cannon and McClelland, 1929a), and Alsted (1938) noted a higher mortality in animals splenectomized one month after the infection than in those operated upon three months later. IV. Adult non-splenectornized albino rats of carrier stock.-Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) and Adler (1930a) observed no subsequent bartonellosis; Meyer (1929), a slight bartonellosis without anemia. Flaum and Lauda (1931) injected very large doses of infected blood subcutaneously into 10 rats. Eight showed no anemia nor visible parasites; 2 died of anemia after 12 to 13 days. V. Adult splenectomized infected white rats.-In general, re-inoculation produces no definite result dur- ing a period lasting from 15 weeks to 8 months. The animals then eliminate the infection (see p. 300) and become susceptible once more. Thus, Reitani (1930d) observed no effect from the inoculation of large doses of infective blood and liver, 40, 70, and 100 days after the first attack. Alsted (1938) re-inoculated 9 ani- mals, 6 and 17 weeks after the initial attack, when all were still carriers. Four developed anemia with barto- nellae, 2 showed bartonellae without anemia,-3 neither</page><page sequence="61">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 301 bartonellae nor anemia. Just how the second inocula- tion acted in those cases showing after-effects is not clear; it will be recalled that spontaneous relapses have been noted as late as five months after splenectomy (p. 293). Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1931a) also report that "re-infection" was possible during the first six weeks after splenectomy-the period when spon- taneous relapses are most common-while groups re- inoculated three or five months later were not "re- infected." Mayer et al. (1927b), utilizing animals which had been well for "weeks or months," produced in 19 of 20 cases a typical bartonellosis after an incubation of 4 to 12 days. McCluskie and Niven (1934) re- inoculated a rat 14 months later, bartonellae appeared in 24 hours, and the animal died 2 days later, showing hemoglobinuria. From these and other data it appears that re- inoculation during the first months after the anemia in reality constitutes super-infection and not re-infection. The super-infection is usually well tolerated; if para- sites and symptoms reappear, they are not distinguish- able from those occurring during a spontaneous re- lapse-and it is even possible that the second inocula- tion may produce a relapse. Some time later, about the end of the first half-year after the acute anemia, the infection disappears in splenectomized animals. Then, re-infection is followed by the acute disease. VI. Animals other than the albino rat.-Variable re- sults have been obtained by different investigations. White mice.-Splenectomized before or after inocu- lation, albino mice develop a transient bartonellosis without anemia (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1927b; Sorge, 1927; Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930; Adler, 1930a, 1930b; Cossali, 1932). Marked anemia some- times ending fatally was obtained by V. Schilling (1929), McCluskie and Niven (1934), and Neitz. (1938). Adler (1930), by successive passages in unoperated mice, noted an adaptation of the virus which became pathogenic for normal rats and not more pathogenic for splenectomized than for normal mice. Wild nice.-Reitani (1930d) apparently infected these animals. Guinea pigs.-Most investigators find that cavies are not susceptible. In regard to the positive results, it should be borne in mind: (1) that guinea pigs rather generally show erythrocytic bodies somewhat resem- bling bartonellae, but which are considered by Wenyon and Low (1914) to be non-parasitic, possibly nuclear remnants; (2) that the above inclusions are definitely not bartonellae (Schwetz, 1934c), but appear enough like them to be a source of confusion; (3) that quite independently of the above inclusions, the guinea pig is spontaneously infected with a bartonella of its own: H. tyzzeri (p. 314). The young splenectomized guinea pig is refractory to H. muris (Battistini and Weiss, 1926), as are adult animals whether splenectomized (Noguchi, 1928a; Amako, 1930a; Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930; Cos- sali, 1932) or not (Ford and Eliot, 1928b; Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930; Cossali, 1932). Noe and Paez (1930) report in splenectomized animals "inclusions" similar to bartonellae, and Klein, Lopatizki, and Soliter- mann ( 1930), injecting non-splenectomized guinea pigs with salmonellae and H. muris, report subsequent bar- tonella infection with transitory anemia. Reitani (1930d) could not confirm this last result even in splenectomized animals and with large doses of B. typhosts. Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932b) report results that are not easy of interpretation. They inoculated 3-week-old non-splenectomized animals with their cultures (p. 299) ; as early as 24 hours later, bar- tonellae were said to have been found in the blood where they were always rare, and were followed by an anemia which, while quite severe, ended in recovery. We may note first that the identification of the organ- ism which they obtained in culture is not certain; sec- ond, that the anemic changes produced by these cultures in the non-splenectomized guinea pig-an animal of doubtful susceptibility-were more marked than in the choice test animal, i. e. the splenectomized bartonella- free rat; third, that the guinea pig has both a true barto- nella infection and bartonellalike erythrocytic inclu- sions. The contention of the authors that these guinea pigs were infected with H. muris cannot as yet be con- sidered to be proved. The same authors found adult non-splenectomized guinea pigs refractory after similar injections. Rabbits.-At the age of three weeks, young non- splenectomized rabbits may sometimes be infected by intravenous inoculation (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). Af- ter an incubation period of 5 to 12 days the bartonellae appear, to be followed by leucocytosis and an anemia which, while sometimes marked, is not fatal and at- tains its maximum in 3 to 7 days. The blood of such rabbits will infect the rat. Kikuth (1932) could not confirm these results even in splenectomized two-week- old rabbits inoculated concomitantly with Trypanosoma brucei, and he concluded that different strains of the organism vary in virulence. The adult non-splenectomized rabbit.-Lourau, De Sacy, and Arthus (1938) injected heavily parasitized blood intravenously or intraperitoneally and observed a transient bartonellosis. Klein and Solitermann (1929) report successful infection after dual inoculation of bartonellae and organisms of the Salmonella group. The majority of authors have found the adult rabbit refractory whether splenectomized or not (Noguchi, 1928a; Amako, 1930a; Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930; Cossali, 1932). Hamsters.-When splenectomized, the hamster may show a light infection (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1927b).</page><page sequence="62">302 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Sphallax 9a typhlops and Meriones tristrami.-These two common Palestinian rodents, after splenectomy, were found susceptible (Adler, 1930b). The former developed a severe infection with hemoglobinuria which ended fatally; the latter developed a less marked ane- mia and recovered. Macacts rhesus.-No infection with H. muris was observed by Battistini and Weiss (1926),1? Noguchi (1928a), Kirschner and Timmerman (1930); nor in Macacus sp. by Adler (1930b). H. Meyer (1929), however, reports that in three M. rhesus, inoculated with his cultures on peptone water (see p. 299), barto- nellae were observed three days later. Splenectomy increased their number in one of the animals; no change was noted in the other two. In two pigeons H. Meyer (1929) with the same cul- ture obtained numerous bartonellae in one case, rare in the other. Reitani (1930d) obtained no infection in the pigeon kept on a deficient diet of polished rice. Only negative results have been reported for dogs (Adler, 1930b), whether young (Reitani, 1930d), half-grown (Ford and Eliot, 1928b), or adult, either splenectomized or normal (Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930) ; for kittens (Reitani, 1930d) or adult cats, sple- nectomized or normal (Cossali, 1932), for splenecto- mized sheep (Neitz, 1938), and for various birds, sple- nectomized or normal (Kirschner and Timmerman, 1930). EPIDEMIOLOGY TRANSMISSION Spread of the infection has been noted by all investi- gators who have had available both parasitized and bartonella-free strains (Haam, Lauda, and Sorge, 1927; Lauda, 1928; Rordorff, 1933, etc.). Arthropod transmnission.-The mechanism now seems well established; transmission occurs through ecto- parasites such as the rat lotise, Polyplax (=Haemato- pinuts) spiniulosus. In 1928 Ford and Eliot noted that all their rats were infected with lice and some with Cirntex lectularius, and suggested that these insects might transmit the disease (1928b). At the same time the experiments of Cannon and McClelland (October, 1928) were published, and somewhat later those of Mayer (December, 1928b). Cannon and McClelland (1928) isolated eight rats of a non-carrier stock in sterilized cages. On each of six animals were placed lice containing the fresh blood 9a Sic. Spalar seems to be the correct designation. 10 Battistini and Weiss (1926) produced no infection in one rhesus monkey after the inoculation of infected rat blood. The same authors (in Battistini, 1926) report different results with their cultures. These, injected in the skin of a rhesus monkey, gave rise to the formation of very vascular nodules said to be macroscopically and histologically similar to those provided by the inoculation of cultures of B. bacilliformis in the same species of monkey. The finding has not been republished by the original authors nor confirmed by others. of an infected rat. Fifteen to nineteen days later they were all splenectomized. All the louse-infested animals underwent a typical bartonellosis, while the two con- trols remained healthy and bartonella-free. Several differently conceived experiments (1929a) are particu- larly illuminating: (1) A splenectomized rat, after a typical bartonella anemia, was deloused and kept for 30 days with three young parasite-free rats. Eleven days later the three young rats were splenectomized, then replaced. They remained bartonella-free for 30 days. (2) A carrier rat, 36 T, was placed with three non-carriers; all the latter became infected. Lice from 36 T transmitted the infection to a fourth rat. 36 T was then deloused and placed with two non-carrier rats. Eleven days later the latter were splenectomized, then replaced with 36 T. During the following 16 days no bartonellae were observed. Mayer (1928b) removed 30 lice from a carrier and placed them on two young parasite-free rats. The carrier was then killed and left overnight in a cage with two splenectomized non-carrier rats, each kept in a box which, while pierced, did not allow contact with the corpse. Then each of the rats was isolated in a sterile container. Eighteen to twenty-three days later each of the four underwent a typical bartonellosis, while con- trols of the same litter remained healthy. The experi- ment was repeated with the same results. Kirschner and Timmerman (1930) and Eliot and Ford (1929) confirmed preceding investigations. When lice from the carriers were used, the incubation period was pro- longed to 25 days, but the disease was just as severe (Eliot and Ford, 1929). Louse transmission thus appears proved." Eliot and Ford (1929) attempted to determine the mecha- nism of transmission (i. e., whether by bite, passive inoculation by crushing followed by scratching, or by ingestion). Lice from infected rats did not produce bartonellosis when ingested (nor did infective liver), but they did so when placed upon the test animals after an incubation period of 18 to 28 days. These experi- ments show that it is not the alimentary route whereby louse transmission occurs, but they do not permit of choice between the other two. It is further possible that the dejecta contain the infective material, as E. Brumpt and da Silva (1912) have shown to be the case in Chagas' disease. Lice kept for 6 to 20 hours at 280 C. remained in- fective (Eliot and Ford, 1929), but were no longer so at 24 hours (Timmerman, 1930). Extremely interesting is the later report (Eliot and Ford, 1932) that a rat studied 10 months after the acute anemia was no longer a carrier, and its lice were not infective. Similarly Vassiliadis (1931) found that lice became non-infective 11 Delousing of rats has been accomplished with lysol (Mayer), flit (Alsted), tincture of delphinium (larkspur) seeds 1 part, 90 percent alcohol 3 parts (Cannon and McClelland, 1929a).</page><page sequence="63">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 303 at the same time that the host was sterilized of its bartonellosis by neoarsphenamine. The flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, transmits the infection by its bite and retains the ability to infect for three days (Timmerman, 1930). Natural transmission by the acarids parasitic on mice has not been demonstrated. Cannon and McClelland (1929a) repeated with negative results, using mites, the experiments they had performed with lice. Inocu- lation of acarians (sp.?) gave Meyer (1929) negative, and Kirschner and Timmerman (1930) positive results. Congenital transmission.-Direct transmission from parent to offspring appears unimportant, if not non- existent, according to almost all authors. Bartonellae are usually first found sometime subsequent to birth, after a period which would seem to correspond to the time necessary for the lice to become established, plus the incubation period after infection by the louse (see p. 302). Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) splenecto- mized a pregnant female who underwent a typical bar- tonellosis. The young were parasite-free and showed no blood changes during the first few days they lived. Severi (1934) did not observe bartonella infection in two-week-old splenectomized rats. Members of the same litter six weeks old, and the mother, died of bartonellosis after splenectomy. Meyer (1929) sple- nectomized rats on successive weeks after birth. Ani- mals 1 week old were not ill; at 2 weeks, 36 percent died; between 3 and 4 weeks, all his animals were infected, and 90 percent died. Adult rats were all in- fected, and 54 percent died. Contact transmission.-No type of transmission by direct contact has yet been shown to exist. Infected rats rid of their ectoparasites do not infect non-carrier rats when placed in the same cage (p. 302): The administration per os of urine or of feces (Mayer et al., 1927b; Lauda, 1930), of blood and of infectious vis- cera (Sorge, 1929b; Eliot and Ford, 1929), even the inunction of infecting material on the epilated skin until complete absorption took place (Sorge), all have remained negative. FACTORS AFFECTING RESISTANCE Climate seems to have an entirely secondary role; however, Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932a) remark that mortality is higher in summer than in winter. Age is very important (see Experimental Inoculation). Sex is reported to have some influence, the disease being more severe in males (Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman, 1932a). Alimentation may perhaps affect the mortality rate (Lauda, 1930); ex- clusive fat diet is said to increase this rate (Galamini, 1930), while vitamin deficiencies may lower the resist- ance of infected animals (p. 306). Associated infec- tions lower, cancers apparently heighten, resistance to the disease. These findings, however, can best be pre- sented in the following section treating of immunology. IMMUNOLOGY We have seen that rats recovered from the anemia, non-splenectomized carrier-rats, and finally other ani- mals than the rat, possess an immunity in regard to H. muris which, however, is not absolute. The mecha- nisms of these immunities are still obscure and subject to controversy. Infection in the rat is not necessarily followed by disease. Consequently, it is advantageous to distinguish between immunity to infection and im- munity to disease. In the albino rat, clinical resistance is marked, immunity to infection probably non-existent. "NATURAL IMMUNITY" Schilling and San Martin (1928), Reitani (1930d), and Yoshiwhara (1931) have observed that splenecto- mized non-carrier rats were refractory to inoculation. Kikuth (1932) suggested that in spite of splenectomy the infection remained latent. Dinger (1929b) fur- nished a possible explanation, when at the autopsy of an apparently bartonella-free rat of carrier stock, a supplementary spleen was found. Since the authors mentioned above did not perform postmortems, a sup- plementary spleen may account for their results. One can conclude that no authentic case of true natural immunity has yet been demonstrated. The rarity of the semblance of such immunity is explicable by the rarity of supplementary spleens in the rat. Ac- cording to Dinger, his case is the only one in the literature. ACQUIRED IMMUNITY This is the only type proved to exist in the rat. The following have no preventive or curative properties: blood or plasma or serum of adult normal rats or of splenectomized rats which have survived the anemia (Ford and Eliot, 1928b; Metelkin, 1928; Amako, 1930a, 1930b; Reitani, 1930d; Cossali, 1932); "im- mune serum" derived from guinea pigs (Metelkin, 1928) or rabbits (Ford and Eliot, 1928b); the serum of normal rabbits (Koh, 1932a, 1930b). Huworal antibodies.-Sorge (1929b) found no pre- cipitins, no thrombocytobarin, and obtained no comple- ment deviation. Reitani (1930d) encountered no iso- agglutinins. Adler (1930b) found no warm, and Weinman (1938) neither warm nor cold, hemolysins in the serum of anemic rats (p. 295). Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932b) report complement deviation at 1: 40 with sera obtained from rabbits injected with cultures, and from "anemic rats," using their cultivated organism as antigen. No agglu- tinins for this organism were produced in rabbits after intravenous inoculation of cultures. Mayer and Malamos (1936) did not obtain immu- nity in rats after repeated injections of infected blood heated to 58? for one hour, or after inoculation with infected blood and spleen treated with various drugs. They could not demonstrate passive immunity subse--</page><page sequence="64">304 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY quent to the administration of sera from rabbits which had received multiple intravenous and subcutaneous injection of infected rat blood. Lawkowicz (1938a) injected rabbits and guinea pigs with his cultures of H. muris, and obtained agglutinins for the homologous culture strain only; the titer was never more than 1: 160. The complement deviation test was positive, however, with both homologous and heterologous strains.12 It was positive in all cases using the sera of adult splenectomized rats during an attack of bartonellosis; in non-splenectomized rats, doubtful or positive (indicating perhaps latent infec- tion); negative in rats less than three weeks old and in adult rats treated with arsenobenzol. Rabbits im- munized with these cultures also gave a positive Weil- Felix reaction with the strains OX19 and OX K. Rat sera, after recovery from bartonellosis, gave not only a positive Weil-Felix, but also agglutinated Rickettsia prowazeki at 1: 40. THE SPLEEN AND INFECTION Two principal factors seem to control the acquired immunity: the presence of the spleen, and the presence of the parasite. To recapitulate the basic findings: (1) the latently-infected rat is resistant to re-inoculation (p. 300); (2) the infected rat, after splenectomy and recovery from the disease, also is resistant for a period of months, and this period corresponds to the duration of latency (p. 300); (3) the non-splenectomized non- carrier rat after infection may develop symptoms of variable intensity, then rapidly becomes resistant (p. 300). Therefore, somewhat paradoxically, it appears that infection is the necessary condition to produce immu- nity to the disease. This type of immunity, dependent on continued infection for its persistence, has been termed premunition. The spleen has a secondary place. It does not pre- vent infection; it does limit multiplication and thus the subsequent anemia. Otherwise stated, there is an equi- librium between the host and the parasite. Certain data aid in clarifying the conditions and the mechanism whereby the spleen influences this equilibrium. I. Prior infection.-The adult non-splenectomized, non-carrier rat after infection undergoes a mild dis- ease, which, however, may start as a severe infection; then, if the animal does not die, it rapidly changes to the mild form. The inhibitory action of the spleen would seem to be slight in non-infected animals, and to take a certain time to reach its maximum, which it does only after infection. II. Age.-(a) Young unoperated rats after infection undergo a more severe disease than adults. The sur- vivors, re-inoculated, behave like the adults; they are premunized. In infected stocks the influence of age 12 Heterologous agglutination of boiled suspensions was re- ported later (1939). per se is difficult to demonstrate, and the greater sus- ceptibility of the young may possibly correspond only to a lower incidence of latent infection. (b) In uninfected stocks, rats up to three weeks of age appear definitely more susceptible than animals twice this age. In regard to protection, the spleen possibly begins to function as in the adult animal only sometime after birth, this period to be situated between the third and sixth week. III. Splenomegaly.-This is a habitual finding in bartonella-infected animals (p. 295), and demonstrates that the infection regularly effects anatomical, histo- logical, and physiological changes in the spleen. Mac- Kay and Polland (1931) noted that in the rat, if one- half of the spleen be left in place, it rapidly regenerates 50 percent of its weight. While they attributed this to bartonella and it was not observed in the rabbit, the experiment was unfortunately not repeated on non- carrier rats. IV. Partial ablationt of the spleen.-Mayer, Borch- ardt, and Kikuth (1927b) found that half the spleen gave protection to adult animals; one-twentieth was not sufficient. Levi (1931) found about one-third the critical amount; more gave protection, less did not. V. Ligature of the splenic vessels.-For most au- thors this is equivalent to splenectomy (Mayer et al., 1927b; Lauda, 1930; Schin, 1930; Levi, 1931; Cossali 1932; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Koh (1932a, 1932b) alone reports bartonellosis in only four of five rats after ligature. VI. Splenic grafts.-When the organ was placed in the scrotum, the resultant mortality was 30 percent, wlhereas all the controls died (Vedder, 1928). Five days after splenectomy, Koh (1922a, 1922b) implanted rat or rabbit spleen in the abdonminal cavity of his anemic rats. Recovery after a few days was obtained four out of five times. Perla and Marmorston- Gottesman (1930) removed fragments of spleen and implanted them in the abdominal wall. Seven weeks later the animals were splenectomized; of the seven rats, four remained lhealthy, three underwent the typical disease. Three weeks after splenectomy the grafts were removed. Histological examination of the three anemic rats showed that "the entire pulp is filled with red cells." "The reticular cells . . . had undergone an exhaustion destruction," whereas in the protected rats the pulp was "regenerated" and of normal appear- ance. The follicles appeared normal in both cases. The authors conclude that the reticulo-endothelial cells of the red pulp are the site of the protective action of the spleen. VII. The spleen of the foetus.-The splenectomized mother is not protected (Bergel and Flaum, 1931; Kikuth, 1932). VIII. In parabiosis.-Removal of the spleen of one of the parabionts has no effect. Subsequent removal of the second spleen produces a typical bartonellosis</page><page sequence="65">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 305 in both animals. Separation produces an anemia in the splenectomized rat, the other animal remaining healthy but becoming anemic in its turn after splenec- tomy (Kolpakow, 1930; Flaum and Lauda, 1931; Cos- sali, 1932). Flaum and Lauda noted an enormous development of the remainiing spleen, which weighed four and one-half tinmes the average; the histological structure was normal. IX. Total spicnzic tissie.-When freshly prepared and injected intraperitoneally, this tissue has had no effect, according to Mayer et al. (1927b) and Ford and Eliot (1930a). Noguchi (1928a), however, re- ported rapid disappearance of the bartonellae, and Koh (1932a, 1932b) obtained the same result with a dried spleen powder, utilized in a 10 percent suspen- sion, of which 0.5 to 1 cc. per 100 gmn. of rat weiglht were used. X. Splenic vein blood scrum.- Koh reports rapid cures; the donor was indifferently the normal dog or rabbit, the dose 1 to 1.5 cc. per 100 gm. of rat weight. Ultra-violet irradiation of the donor rabbit doubled the activity of the serumi. Dried serum was as active as the fresh, and the aqueous extract of this powder was active, not the fractions soluble in alcohol or ether. The active substance was destroyed at 1000 after 30 minutes, but resisted 800. Confirmation of these re- sults would be of the utmost importance. XI. Injected splenic extract.-Neither Vedder (1928) nor Mendes Ferreira and Higgins (1936) re- port favorable results. Perla and Marmorston- Gottesman prepared a lipoid extract which seemed to have a preventive action (1932a) ; they later (1941) report "the efficacy of splenic extracts in preventing the disease . . . has . . . diminished." Pando (1934), us- ing the same extract, observed no preventive action. XII. The ingestiont of spleen.-Perla and Marmor- ston-Gottesnman (1932a) observed no obvious results from raw or cooked spleen of the ox, calf, pig, or rat. XIII. In, vitro, freshly ground spleen mixed witlh parasitized blood and left to stand for one hour does not change the infectiousness of the blood (Ford and Eliot, 1928b). XIV.-Finally it must be noted that the spleen ex- erts a dual role toward the parasite. Not only does it regulate development of the bartonellae, but also it as- sures their survival in the animal. For we have seen that the non-splenectomized carrier-rat remains infec- tious indefinitely, whereas after splenectomy, sooner or later, but quite constantly, the blood will no longer transmit, the disease (p. 300). Thus with elimination of the spleen we have altered the environment of the parasite; indefinite survival is no longer possible. From all of these facts, can the regulatory mechanism whereby the spleen controls the latent infection be de- duced ? It must be admitted that in spite of the abun- dant experimental data, a clear, unequivocal explana- tion cannot yet be offered. The majority of investi- gators are inclined to accept Lauda's hypothesis of a special hormone secreted by the spleen and in particu- lar by the reticulo-endothelial cells of this organ. An alternative hypothesis is maintained by Dinger (1929b)-that of a filtration mechanism. The spleen, according to this explanation, retainis and destroys the parasitized erythrocytes. In this fashion the micro- organisms are removed from the blood and thus ren- dered inoffensive. In favor of the hormone hypothesis, the following evidence is cited: the results of parabiosis and the con- sequent splenomegaly, the action of spleen or splenic extracts when injected, the effect of spleen grafts and of the injection of blood from the splenic vein. How- ever, parabiosis is also evidenice for the filtration view, for the blood of the spleenless parabiont passes through the spleen of its partner. The resulting splenomegaly might result from phagocytosis increased twofold as well as from augmented secretion. The evidence of- fered by grafts is likewise equivocal, for if the grafts persist, they do so because vascular connections have become reestablished and thus allow of phagocytosis. Further, in those cases where the grafts were inactive, it was precisely the phagocytic elements which had de- generated: the reticulo-endothelial cells. Splenic extracts have not given consistently positive results. If active extracts are ever obtained, in view of the inactivity of whole fresh spleen, it will be neces- sary to prove that the process of extraction did not create new substances not preexisting in the body. The action of blood from the splenic vein would be convincing if constantly observed. The splenectomized pregnant female is not pro- tected by the foetal spleen. Since the intact placenta permits no erythrocyte exchange, but would presumably let hormones pass through, this seems evidence against the hormonal theory. Unfortunately, this also is sub- ject to a dual interpretation, for there is reason to be- lieve that the spleen acquires full protective properties only some time after birth. In favor of the filtration theory, Dinger (1929b) cites the facts that the parasites persist in the carrier animal in spite of the spleen, and that they multiply rapidly after splenectomy at a time when the splenic secretion would still be expected to be present. Thus, we still do not know how the spleen acts to restrain the anemia. It is striking, however, that with the spleen intact, infection persists indefinitely; whereas after splenectomy, infection ultimately disappears. How this may be correlated with a spleen hormone is not apparent. EXTRASPLENIC CELLULAR FACTORS To explain the post-splenectomy immunity, addi- tional information must be considered. The extrasplenic reticulo-endothelium.-If the de- fensive function of the spleen is related to its reticulo-</page><page sequence="66">306 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY endothelial elements, then one may anticipate that the same type of tissue elsewhere performs a similar func- tion. In non-infected animals, after splenectomy the other reticulo-endothelium does not replace the spleen, for such animals remain susceptible, regardless of the length of the interval between splenectomy and infection (p. 300). During the anemia, however, the wlhole reticulo-endo- thelium appears to proliferate, and in recovered cases this reaction persists for a long time. Marmorston- Gottesman and Perla (1931a) offer the following ex- planation: The reticulo-endothelial system reacts to re- place the spleen only when some physiological need calls it forth. To test this, Perla (1933) studied sec- tions of splenectomized non-carrier rats and found re- ticulo-endothelial tissue present in lesser amount than during bartonellosis. Blockade of the reticulo-cndothelial systemt of n1o01- splenlcctoilni2ed rats.-After Inldia ink or iron saccharate injections, a transitory mild bartonellosis may occa- sionally occur (Mayer ct al., 1 927b; Haendel and Haagen, 1928; Cannon and McClelland, 1929b; Fried- berg, 1929; Schin, 1930; Cossali, 1932). Blockade fol- lowed by the inoculation of bartonellae produces an intense infection and marked anemia (Rosenthal alid Zohman, 1931). The above experiments have only limited value for our purpose, for the spleen is blocked as well as the rest of the reticulo-endothelial system. More perti- nent are the observations of Cannon and McClelland (1929b), who blockaded spleiiectornized rats and then noted a relapse. It would seem, therefore, that the extrasplenic reticulo-endothelium does play somie part in the de- fense of the animal. No observations permit us to in- fer whether it is by a secretion or by phagocytosis. It is striking, however, that the majority of authors who believe the spleen acts through a hormone seem to think the extrasplenic reticulo-endothelium acts by phago- cytosis. Taliaferro, Cannon, and Goodloc (1931) find that the spleen weight is increased by blockade alone, the in- crease is greater through infection alone, and greatest wlhei infection and blockade are combined. These autlhors believe that latent bartonellosis diminishes the activity of the reticulo-endotlhelium, for they note a particularly acute evolution of certain protozoan in- fections in carrier-rats. Splenectomy alone does not decrease the production of the "reproduction-inhibiting antibody" active against Try panosomna le7cisi, whereas splenectomy and bartonella infection ldoes decrease it markedly. Otlier organs.-Removal of a kidney, the testicles, the thyroid, of fragments of liver or brain, of peri- toneum, or of thymus has no influence on the bartonel- losis (Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth, 1927b; Cannon and McClelland, 1929b; Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla, 1930b; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Adrenal glands.-Marmorston-Gottesman and Perla (1932a) removed both adrenals from non-splectomized non-carrier rats, then infected them. The majority rapidly died of toxemia. Those which survived more than two days and which received large doses of infec- tive material, underwent a typical bartonellosis. The latently infected rat after double adrenalectomy de- veloped no anemia. The conclusion reached was that suprarenalectomy diminished natural resistance to the disease, but not the acquired resistance. ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS, INTOXICATIONS, ETC. Mayer and Zeiss (1920) found that Trypanosona rhodesiense alone was inadequate to produce the anemia, and that the trypanosomes and Bayer 205 were active. Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) noted in rats infected with Trypanosomna lewisi rare bartonellae but no anemiia. Similar results were obtained by Talia- ferro, Cannon, and Goodloe (1931) and Roseiitlhal and Zohman (1931). Ford and Eliot (1928b) trapped wild rats which they found carrying trypanosomes and leptospiras in the kidneys; these animals had visible bartonellae in the blood. Marmorstoin-Gottesman and Perla (1930a) found, in T. lewisi infections, bartonel- losis with moderate anemia, and occasionally in young animals a fatal anemia, whereas the trypanosomiasis alone did not produce these effects. In these T. lewisi infections they found that the reticular cells of the spleen contained numerous phagocyted erythrocytes; this mechanism is believed in some measure to be analogous to splenectomy and allows the bartonellae to appear. Bacterial infections such as the following may have a similar effect: Pasteurella (Reitani, 1930d), Gaert- ner's bacillus (Reitani, 1930d; H. Meyer, 1929), Eberth's bacillus (Sorge, 1929b), aind various of the salmnonellae (Klein et al., 1930). In most of these cases the infection produced a severe bartonellosis. The peculiar results of V. Schilling and San Martin (1928) with their cultures were perhaps analogous (see p. 298). Intoxicati,ons.-Toluylene diaminie, pyridine, phenyl hydrazine, saponine, hemolytic serum (Lauda and Markus, 1928; Judenic, 1931; McCluskie and Niven, 1934), typhoid or scarlet fever vaccine, basic fuchsin, methylene blue (Judenic, 1931), Bayer 205 alone- none of these are active. Yet sterile glucose broth in- jected introperitoneally was observed by C. Schilling and Neumann (1929) to induce a typical bartonellosis. It is of the utmost importance tlherefore, in testing sup- posed cultures of H. mnuris, that the test animals be bartonella-free, for not only various mnicro-organisms but even the culture medium may provoke bartonellosis in the infected animal. Dietary factors.-Combined A and C avitaminosis in the non-splenectomized rat provoked a severe bartonella</page><page sequence="67">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 307 anemia (Wills and Mehta, 1930). D-deficient diet fed to rats one to four weeks before splenectomy doubled the subsequent mortality; no bartonellosis was observed before the operation (Hajdu, 1937). McCluskie and Niven (1934), with an unspecified insufficient diet, did not obtain "more bartonellae than with an abundance of vitamines." After several days of fasting on the part of non-splenectomized rats, Lauda (1930) produced the anemia by injecting large doses of infective material. An exclusive fat diet is said to increase the resistance of the rat (Galamini, 1930). The anemia which de- velops in rats fed on goat's milk had the same charac- ters in carrier and parasite-free stocks, and it is not stated that this diet provoked patent bartonellosis (Ochse, 1936). Variouts factors.-Hemorrhage may provoke the dis- ease (Cossali, 1932). Fatigue and X-ray irradiation of the spleen are without action (Roth, 1932). Cancers.-Blumenthal and Auler (1926) observed that the mortality following splenectomy was less in cancerous rats than in non-tumor-bearing animals. This unexpected result has been confirmed by Hirsch- feld and Tinozzi (1928), Haendel and Haagen (1928), and Kikuth (1932). The last named thinks that the resistance of the cancerous rats, which is very slight, is due only to the large number of young red cells which result from the tumor. The young red cell is less favorable for the parasites, as Kikuth judges from his studies on toxic anemias (phenylhydrazine and toluy- lene diamine). The influence of age, climate, and sex has already been considered (see p. 300). THERAPY ANTI-PARASITIC Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) obtained true sterilization of the latent or declared infection with or- ganic arsenical compounds. They report the follow- ing chemotherapeutic coefficients: Neoarsphenamine 1: 72 13 Arsalyt 1: 85 Tryparsamide 1: 4.8 The following were inactive: sodium arseniate and cacodylate, yatren, bismuth utilized as "pallicide," methylene blue, trypaflavin, Bayer 205, sodium salicy- late, tartar emetic, and antimosan. Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929c) in addition found atoxyl active, and stibosan inefficacious. Yoshiwhara (1931) reported slight action from derivatives of stibi- nic acid. Uhlenhuth and Seiffert (1931; 1933) ob- 13 Mayer, Borchardt, and Kikuth (1927b) administered neo- salvarsan orally and subcutaneously. The anemia was cured by very small doses (1.4 mg. per kg. of weight); with 3 mg. per animal the disease did not appear after splenectomy. For cer- tain sterilization, Vassiliadis (1931) recommends three injec- tions, with a few days interval between each, of 10 mg. per 100 gm. of weight. served slight action with stibosan (coefficient 1: 8) marked with arsphenamine (1: 80). Proprietaries con- taining both arsenic and antimony, and referred to as "283," "246," and "386 B," were particularly favorable with respective coefficients of 1: 300 to 400, 1: 400 to 500, and 1:3500.14 The favorable action of the organic arsenicals has been confirmed by Lisgunowa (1928), Reitani (1930d), Amako (1930a, 1930b), Schin (1930), and Cossali (1932). Sulfanilamide provided no benefit (Emery, 1940) when administered either after infection at a dose of 120 mg. daily, or when a 1 percent solution was mixed with infected blood, the mixture allowed to stand ten minutes, and then injected intra-abdominally. Drug-fastness was noted by Mayer and Malamos (1936). If the host rat is treated at first with dis- tinctly subcurative doses of neoarsphenamine or of Sdt 386, later the normal curvative dose will no longer eradicate the infection. Also, some rats thus prepared with neoarsphenamine were not subsequently cured by the normal therapeutic dose of 386. The converse, or increased susceptibility to drugs, was remarked after repeated injections of curative doses. This resulted in a state where an originally in- sufficient dose was therapeutically active. ANTI-ANEMIC Liver therapy.-Most authors find either ingested or injected liver inefficacious (Sorge, 1928; Vedder, 1928; Radvanyi, 1929; Schumacher and Edwards, 1929; Neumann, 1930; Fischer and Verzar, 1930; Friede- mann and Deicher, 1930; Reiter, 1931; Ederle and Kriech, 1931; Gansslen, 1931; Singer, 1931; Cossali, 1932; Rachmilewicz, 1932; Benzoni, 1928; Lourau, De Sacy, and Arthus, 1938, 1939). Lourau, De Sacy, and Arthus (1938) well point out that since erythropoiesis is not arrested in bartonella anemia, in contradistinction to the findings in human pernicious anemia, there is no reason to anticipate favorable results in the bartonella anemia from hepato- therapy. In 170 animals used to test fresh liver and liver extracts, no constant difference between treated and control animals was noted in regard to mortality, regeneration, or gravity of relapses. Benzoni (1938) agrees that this anemia is not a test of the anti-pernici- ous principle, nor even, he adds, of the fraction which acts on the secondary anemia. However, favorable results from administration of liver were reported by Haendel and Haagen (1928) and by Eros and Kunos (1933). The last named also found effective an ex- tract of the intestines of pigs and chickens. Chaho- 14 386 B, also referred to- as "Sdt 386 B," contains 18 per- cent arsenic and 20 percent antimony (Schmidt and Peter, 1937). The fatal dose for rats is 750 mg. per kg. injected subcutaneously; 500 mg. per kg. is tolerated by all rats; 0.2 mg. per kg. is the "therapeutic dose"; 0.5 mg. causes the transient disappearance of H. muris for a few days (Kikuth, 1937).</page><page sequence="68">308 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY vitch, Vichnjitch, and Frajnd (1934) injected anemic rats with a pig spleen digest preparation. Regenera- tion was said to be more marked in the test than in the control animals. Iron.-Given orally, iron has no effect (Lauda, 1930; Neumann, 1930), or only in animals fed an inadequate diet of bread and water (Schwarz, 1929). Perla and Marmorston-Gottesman (1932b) report favorable re- sults either alone or with copper. Copper.-Given alone and orally as the sulphate, copper at a dose of 0.1 mg. of metal daily, iron alone administered per os as the ammoniacal citrate at a dose equivalent to 1 mg. of iron daily, or both together in the above manner, afforded protection to splenectom- ized infected animals in the sense that their red cell counts and hemoglobin remained within normal limits and bartonellae were absent or rare. Medication, started 9 to 12 days before splenectomy, protected 75 percent of the animals which received either copper alone or copper and iron; it protected 50 percent of those receiving iron alone. Given 27 to 60 days before splenectomy, it protected 33 percent of all groups. When administered 2 days before and 30 days after operation, no protection was afforded. The protected rats, after discontinuation of the copper, sometimes de- veloped bartonella infection and anemia. It was thought that the effect of the copper was indirect and not due to any anti-parasitic action (Perla and Mar- morston-Gottesman, 1932b). No favorable effects from copper were observed by Pando (1934). Like- wise, Beard and Haam (1934) did not notice any ac- tion on the bartonella anemia to result from intra- peritoneal injections of iron and copper at doses optimal for nutritional anemia, even when irradiation with ultraviolet rays was also employed. HAEMOBARTONELLA BOVIS (DONATIEN AND LESTOQUARD, 1934) Haemobartonellae were noted in oxen at about the same time by Donatien and Lestoquard (July, 1934), who called the organism Bartonella bovis, and by Adler and Ellenbogen (September, 1934), who termed it Bartonella sergenti. Rodriguez, the following year (1935), observed what was probably the same parasite. Nieschulz (1938) and Nieschulz and Bos (1939) de- scribe as Bartonella wenyoni an organism found in calves and which is probably identical with Eperythro- zoon wenyoni. The apparent synonymy is: Haemo- bartonella bovis (Donatien and Lestoquard, 1934) = Bartonella sergenti Adler and Ellenbogen, 1934= ? Bartonella bovis Rodriguez, 1935. The parasite was discovered by Donatien and Lesto- quard (1934) in Algeria, in a bull infected with Thei- leria mutans and splenectomized six months after its arrival from France. The theileria infection then be- came more intense. Fifteen days after the operation they noted erythrocytic parasites resembling H. canis and H. muris. Twenty percent of the red cells were infected at times and individual cells carried as many as 20 parasites. This organism, associated with Thei- leria dispar and Babesiella berbera, was inoculated in series to non-splenectomized cattle. In them it ap- peared after an incubation of 14 to 53 days, remained visible for 3 to 6 days, and then became latent for at least 8 months. Subsequent splenectomy produced a second attack. Clinical symptoms seemed to be ab- sent. Gonacrine, injected 4 days before the attack in a single 1-gram dose, was without effect. Adler and Ellenbogen (1934) report the parasite from Palestine. It appeared in a non-splenectomized calf, 13 days after inoculation with Theileria annulata. The bodies were bacillary in shape, about 1,u in length; from 1 to 7 were found on the infected red cells, and these were sparse (less than 0.1 percent). No obvious symptoms were noted. Rodriguez's observations were made in Granada (1935). The parasite reached a length of 5,k to 6.5(L and was said to provoke fever in the host cow. Despite divergences from the preceding descriptions, until more information is available this organism is considered to be H. bovis. HAEMOBARTONELLA CANIS (KIKUTH. 1929) HISTORY The history of the post-splenectomy anemia of the dog is very similar to that of the rat. The dog has, for a long time, been one of the animals preferred for the study of iron metabolism and the physiology of the spleen. Asher and his collaborators (Vogel, Takahashi, and others) maintained that splen- ectomy in this animal is always followed by an in- creased elimination of iron. In 1918 Pearce, Krumb- haar, and Frazier noted that splenectomy in the dog was followed by an anemia of variable intensity, which might reach 3,000,000 red blood cells and 55 percent hemoglobin, accompanied by leucocytosis and an in- crease in the red cell resistance. They noted a red bone marrow and erythrophagocytosis by the liver endothelium. Asher's findings were not confirmed, for marked increase in iron output was observed only in the cases of marked anemia; consequently they concluded that splenectomy alone was not directly responsible for the metabolic disfunction but only indirectly through the anemia which sometimes followed. In 1928 Kikuth removed the spleen of a dog with chronic piroplasmosis, which came from Mesnil's lab- oratory in Paris. Six days later erythrocytic struc- tures resembling bartonellae appeared in blood films. The specific name canis was proposed (1928b), with the reservation that the organism could be B. bacilli- formis, with which the dogs might have been inoculated. The discovery- was confirmed by Perard in Paris (1929b) in animals of the same stock used by Kikuth but never utilized for bartonella experiments. Finally Regendanz and Reichenow (1932) observed a spon-</page><page sequence="69">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 309 taneous infection in Hamburg free from concomitant piroplasmosis, confirmed most of Kikuth's findings, and added new observations. In the light of these findings, Wilson and Krumb- haar (1933) re-studied the post-splenectomny anemia. No parasites were observed, despite systematic study of blood films. From this fact and because of differ- ences between the anemias observed in the rat and those that they found in dogs, Wilson and Krumbhaar concluded that the canine anemia they had studied was not caused by bartonella. Munch (1936) and Weiss and Pons (1938) have also reported a post-splenectomy anemia in bartonella-free dogs, reaching a maximum 3 to 4 weeks after the operation. This non-bartonella post-splenectomy anemia is stated to have a late onset, to be mild in degree, to be accom- panied by a moderate reticulocytosis, and to cause no mortality. Weiss and Pons noted leucocytosis in such animals, whereas bartonella-carriers developed leu- copenia. Thus apparently two anemic states may develop in the dog: one due to IH. canis infection, the other of undetermined etiology. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION H. canis has now been observed as a spontaneous infection in Europe (vide supra), in India (Ray and Idnani, 1940), in North and South Africa (Donatien and Lestoquard, 1937b; Neitz, 1939a), and in North and South.America (Rhoads and Miller, 1935; Weiss and Pons, 1936). While its distribution is thus very widespread, even in infected localities bartonella-free animals may be common. THE ANEMIA INCUBATION PERIOD In splenectomized carrier-dogs this interval is 6 days after operation (Kikuth, 1932) or as long as 8 to 10 days (Perard, 1929b). In parasite-free splenectomized dogs infected by intravenous inoculation of blood, it may be shortened to 2 or 3 -days (Weiss and Pons, 1938). Visible infections developing in carriers with- out splenectomy have also been reported (see p. 311). PERIOD OF ANEMIA The anemia is quite variable: constant in the cases studied by Kikuth (1932), inconstant and usually moderate in those reported by Regendanz and Reiche- now (1932). Weiss and Pons (1938) find the dis- ease more acute and the mortality higher in young animals. The red cell count may fall to 1,600,000, and recovery still take place (Regendanz and Reichenow, 1932), or even to 80,000 (sic) in the fatal cases (Ray and Idnani, 1940), and the hemoglobin may drop to 15 or even 10 percent of normal values (Rhoads and Miller, 1935). Weiss and Pons made a very careful quantitative study in 1938. They found macrocytosis marked, the mean cell volume increasing from 70 to 117 cubic mi- crons. The mean cell hemoglobin rose from 21 to 29 micro-micrograms, but the mean concentration of hemo- globin fell from 30 to 25 percent, thus qualifying the anemia as hypochromic. They observed no regular relation between the number of parasites and the direc- tion of the blood change; notably, disappearance of parasites was followed either by increase or decrease of the red count. Reticulocytes were markedly in- creased from 0.3 percent at a level of 6 to 61/2 million, to 28.6 percent at 1 to 11/2 million; for a given red cell count the reticulocyte percentage was lower in the cases which terminated fatally and dropped several days before death. The authors attribute the reticulocyto- sis to increased medullary activity, but hold, curiously enough, that the anemia itself is caused at least in part by medullary inhibition. Anisochromia with both pale and polychromatophilic cells is marked; crescent bodies, Cabot rings, Howell- Jolly bodies, and microblasts are found (Kikuth, 1932). Regendanz and Reichenow (1932) noted only a "spherical" appearance of the red cells in some cases. The blood bilirubin reactions are inconstant and irregular. Weiss and Pons (1938) found the Van den Bergh direct, indirect, and biphasic reactions may all be positive or conversely negative, even in animals which die of the disease. These authors conclude that there is no relation between the anemia and the biliru- binemia, but a direct relation between the latter and the liver lesions found at autopsy. The leucocyte count is variable: increased for Kikuth, and as high as 45,900 for Rhoads and Miller (1935), while Weiss and Pons encountered a constant leu- kopenia. General symptoms have been noted but most often in mixed infections with piroplasma or other organisms. These consist in loss of weight, progressive cachexia, and fever above 400 C. (Kikuth, Perard). Ray and Idnani noted marked dyspnea at rest. EVOLUTION The acute attack usually lasts for a few days only. Tfiere also exist forms which may last for months. Most often the disease progresses throughout a series of relapses which may be as many as nineteen (Regen- danz and Reichenow), varying in duration from one day to several weeks, and alternating with periods when bartonellae are not visible in the blood. Relapses may be prolonged and may occur as late as four months after the initial attack (Weiss and Pons). PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY Weiss and Pons (1938) have made a recent report. Liver lesions were conspicuous during the acute period. The organ was enlarged and in section showed pro- liferation of the Kupffer cells, which were phagocytic and contained hemosiderin. Submiliary necrotic foci</page><page sequence="70">310 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY composed of abnormal hepatic cells (the endothelial elements remained intact), with surrounding localiza- tion of fat, were noted. These were often situated in the center of a liver lobule.15 Periportal proliferation, usually moderate, was sometimes very marked. Biliary cylinders and pigment were described both in Kupffer and in hepatic cells. Hemosiderin was encountered regularly, not only in endothelial cells but also in liver cell cytoplasm and nuclei. Enlarged lymph nodes were common, and were some- times red. Erythrophagia was intense, and siderophilic cells are described. Both of these are stated to be more notable than the similar phenomena due to splenectomy alone. In a few cases erythropoiesis in the lymph nodes is described with erythroblastic nests in the medullary substance. Kidney lesions were always encountered during the acute period. Glomerular pathology, consisting of exudate, swelling, adhesions, or atrophy were of con- stant occurrence. The convoluted tubules and Henle's loops at times contained desquamated cells and albu- minous cylinders. Pronounced infarcts in this organ were not infrequent. Munch (1936) studied bone marrow and found dur- ing the acute period marked hyperplasia of all elements, both stroma and free cells. Later, during the chronic phase, the hyperplasia of all the elements was still ob- served, erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis being promi- nent. Ray and Idnani (1940) encountered parasites in various of the viscera in impression films. These al- ways had the same spatial relationship to the erythro- cytes as in the blood; in spleen films, however, they never encountered any parasites at all. PATHOGENESIS The evidence already cited in regard to bone marrow activity and high reticulocyte counts is concordant, and indicates that hemotopoiesis is active during the anemia. The anemia is apparently not due to abnormal produc- tion but to an increase in destruction. How this takes place is not yet elucidated. Knutti, Hawkins, and Whipple (1935) helieve that the hemoglobin is liber- ated from altered cells, that it is only slightly altered, and that the globin fraction is readily available for new hemoglobin synthesis. PROTISTOLOGY DEFINITION Haemobartonella canis (Kikuth, 1929) has all the common characters of the genus. It is found naturally as a wide-spread spontaneous parasite of the dog. While it does not infect the majority of other animals, the splenectomized cat is susceptible. In this animal serial passage may be made. Morphological variation 15 See discussion of necrotic hepatic foci in human bartonel- losis, chapter I, p. 259. is very marked; rod, ring, coccoid, and complex forms co-exist in the same blood. Cultural characteristics are not yet determined; the mode of natural transmission, presumably by a hematophagous arthropod, is unknown. HABITAT The only naturally occurring sources of H. canis as yet known are the mammalian hosts. Experiments have shown that the organism may persist in fleas and in one instance in the malpighian tubes of infected ticks. MORPHOLOGY The dog parasite is one of the most polymorphous of the bartonellae: thin rods, straight or slightly curved, dumbbell-shaped organisms, dots, coccoids, rings, and rows of organisms resulting from transverse divisions have been described. The rows or chains may be com- posed of only one type of element: rods or coccoids or rings. At other times they are mixed, and in this case the large round forms are in the center, the coccoids or rods at the extremities. The diameter of the chain is maximal in the center, where the round and ring forms occur. Regendanz and Reichenow (1932) think that the rings arise from smaller structures by a process of "swelling," and that several stages of this process may be seen in a single chain. When many elements be- come swollen, a certain number are expelled from the chain, then forming the parallel rows or irregular masses which are often seen lying beside the chains. The chains may be straight, or more often curved, following the curvature of the red cell to which they ad- here. At times they are branched. Beside these, H. canis has other and most peculiar forms. The chains themselves are sometimes annular. These large rings may be situated in three different manners in reference to the red cell: (1) the large ring is placed on the sur- face of the cell; (2) the ring is situated, beltlike, around the cell, surrounding its two surfaces; (3) the ring is perpendicular to the surface of the cell, and lying in the plasma appears to pierce the cell in its periphery like an earring, sometimes even in two places. Goyanes (1936) described certain parasites to which were appended irregular, pale-staining, veillike struc- tures which he likened to an undulating membrane. Frequently certain typical short forms, rods or coccoids, were distributed along the edge. Division of the coccoids, according to Ray and Idnani (1940), takes place by elongation; at this time these elements stain more heavily along one edge. Then a constriction appears, followed by a separation of the daughter elements. As may be conceived, the size is very variable. The round forms vary from 0.5ju (Perard, 1929b, 1929c) or 0.2,u (Kikuth, 1929b) to the limits of visibility; single rods are from lu to 5y long and 0.2ju wide, while the composite forms vary from lju to 4p (Perard).</page><page sequence="71">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 311 In fresh blood, H. canis is said to be visible and to be seen even more easily in the dark-field. Methylene blue used as a vital dye is reported to stain the organ- isms distinctly (Regendanz and Reichenow, 1932). The majority of authors find them non-motile, but Rhoads and Miller (1935) reported active motility in dark-field preparations. In fixed blood films, Giemsa's fluid stains the para- site in a red which is generally intense but may vary considerably. The round forms are not so pale as Eperythrozoon. With the use of Gram's and Ziehl Neelson's method, the parasite does not retain the stain. Their situation is epi-erythrocytic. Towards the end of the access, they are said to collect in an eccentric mass on the red cell and to be numerous in the plasma. At this time Perard found almost only round forms. Regendanz and Reichenow did not find the parasite in the viscera. Ray and Idnani reported it absent from blood obtained from the spleen when it was found on red cells from other organs. Filtration has given equivocal results. Kikuth suc- ceeded by using Berkefeld N filters. Regendanz and Reichenow could not reproduce these results. CULTIVATION AND VIABILITY Cultivation has not been demonstrated. The author obtained growth of a bartonellalike organism in semi- solid rabbit serum-agar medium inoculated with citrated blood from a heavily parasitized dog. Gross and micro- scopic morphology was that characteristic of the bar- tonellae. The organisms stained typically with Giemsa and did not retain the violet in Gram's method. This growth was obtained in Peru. Circumstances prevent- ing the inoculation of local dogs, it was only three months later that splenectomized bartonella-free dogs were available in Boston. During this period the cul- tures had been maintained two weeks at ship's refrig- erator temperature (about 100 C.) and more than eight weeks at room temperature. Subsequently they were not infectious and subcultures failed. Knutti and Haw- kins (1935) were not successful, using the same me- dium incubated at 30? C. In other trials the following media have been maintained at 200 and 370: media containing serum of splenectomized dogs (Kikuth); NNN, "Noguchi's medium for leptospira" (Pe'rard, Regendanz, and Reichenow); blood broth; Chatton's medium covered with vaseline for Trichomastix (Perard). Herrer (1942) cultivated an organism which he considers to be not H. canis, but another or- ganism of the bartonella-grahamella group. The infectivity of the blood is not retailned more than three days at laboratory temperature or six days in the refrigerator. EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION Infection of the splenectomized dog is evident two to four days after inoculation. Unoperated dogs have a transitory slight bartonellosis without anemia. Nega- tive results have been reported for the following spleni- ectomized bartonella-free animals: guinea pig, rat, rab- bit, and the monkey, Ccrcopithoccts sabaeus. Rhoads and Miller (1935) observed no anemia nor parasites in the following unoperated animals: mice, white rats, young rabbits, young dogs, and young guinea pigs. The splenectoinized cat was not infected by Kikuth; Regendanz and Reichenow (1932) were able to carry H. canis in this animal by serial passages. The infec- tion is similar to that in the dog; round forms are said to predominate and organisms have a marked tendency to localize at the periphery of the red cell. The lonig annular chains which appear to pierce the red cell are particularly frequent. In the jackal (sp.?) Donatien and Lestoquard (1937b) found bartonella. The animal had been in- oculated with Rickettsia canis and it is not clear whetlher the bartonella was of canine origin, or latent in the jackal and made evident by the R. canis infection (see below, "Factors Affecting Resistance"). EPIDEMIOLOGY TRANSMISSION Arthropod transmission has been studied by Regeii- danz and Reichenow (1932). Ground dog-fleas will infect other dogs; negative results were reported from the bite of the insect or inoculation of feces. Similar negative findings followed the bite or inoculation of bedbugs; of adults or nymphae of Deripnacentor reticu- latus, of Rhipicephalius sanguinzeuts, and of Ornithodoros mnoubata. Only once, the inoculation of the Mal- phighian tubes of one tick were positive. Hereditary and contact transmission do not appear to have received mtuch sttudy. FACTORS AFFECTING RESISTANCE The age of the animal appears important. Weiss and Pons (1938) report a more acute disease with higher mortality in young animals. Associated infections and bleedings may so alter re- sistance that the disease is made manifest without splenectomy. Thus McNaught, Woods, and Scott (1935) conducted experiments in which animals were bled and then transfused with washed red cells from healthy donors, thus removing plasma. After more than five liters of whole blood were so removed, H. canis suddenly appeared in the blood, coincident with an equally sudden drop in the total red cell volume. Subsequent laparotomy proved the spleen to be present. Added infections may also make the bartonellosis of carriers evident, as Neitz (1939a) observed in a dog carrying Hepatozoon canis, Piroplasma canis, and Haemobartonella canis and infected with Rickettsia canis. Ray and Idnani (1940) report similar findings in mixed infections with Babesia gibsoni and H. cantis. The "black tongue" - producing (pellagroid) diet does not produce visible bartonellosis in non-splenectomized carriers (Rhoads and Miller, 1935) .</page><page sequence="72">312 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY IMMUNOLOGY In the dog the outstanding phenomena resemble those obtaining in the rat. Normal non-splenectomized ani- mals, when infected by H. canis only, present a brief period of bartonellosis unaccompanied by anemia. In Ray and Idnani's report (see above) an accompanying babesia infection was said to lhave been eliminated; sub- sequently in non-splenectomized animals inoculation was followed by anemia and bartonellae. The majority of autihors have found splenectomy essential. The interval elapsing between the operation and the infection may be prolonged, but successful in- fection will still take place. An occasional unsuscepti- bility may be anticipated owing to the presence of an accessory spleen. The action of the spleen in controlling the bartonella infection also appears similar to that occurring in the rat; for a detailed consideration of this mechanism, see pages 304 et seq. The possibility that a simple post- splenectomy anemia may occur in the dog has already been discussed (p. 309). THERAPY Anti-parasitic therapy can result in complete steril- ization. For such results the dose of neoarsphenamine is 15 mg. per kg. of body weight. Smaller doses cause only a temporary disappearance of parasites. An ex- tract of spleen was administered by Knutti and Haw- kins (1935) to bartonella-infected splenectomized bile- fistula dogs. Feeding of high doses, equivalent to 700 gm. of fresh spleen, was followed by a rise and relative stabilization of the hemoglobin level; smaller doses were inefficacious. CONTROL The infection could doubtless be controlled by the methods combining arsenotherapy and disinsectization, which have been so effective with H. muris. How- ever, in dogs which retain their spleen, infection is usually asymptomatic; thus no important disease prob- lem exists. For the investigator who wishes bartonella- free animals, it might prove more expedient to splen- ectomize a large number of animals, with the knowl- edge that the infection is irregularly distributed, and to utilize those free from infection, than to apply con- trol measures. HAEMOBARTONELLA MICROTI (TYZZER AND WEINMAN, 1939) An additional species of rodent bartonella was found in 1939 in the vole Mlicrotus peninsylvanicus pennsyl- vanicus. H. microti is notable for its extreme mor- phological variation and for its lack of pathogenicity in spite of massive blood-stream infection. Zeulzer (1927) reported erythrocytic inclusions con- sisting of rods, coccoids, and rings in the European vole. M. arvalis; she concluded that the bodies were not degeneration products but parasites, and belonged in either Grahamellca or Bartonella. No specific designa- tion was given; but Yakimoff (1928) later referred to these structures as Bartonella arvicolae. Kikuth (1932) suggested that they resulted from a mixed in- fection with eperythrozoon and grahamella, and inter- preted as a double infection with eperythrozo6n and Schilling's H. muris musculi, the organisms which he observed in M. arvalis. Since ring, rod, and coccoid forms are found in pure infections with H. nicroti, it seems possible that Zeulzer and Kikuth may have en- countered a similar or identical bartonella in the Euro- pean vole. Trapped specimens of the North American vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicts, carry as many as seven different blood parasites, and in such wild animals bartonellae may be found before splenectomy; they are, however, rare. Two to tlhree days after splen- ectomy heavy blood infections occur; the incubation period, after inoculation, of bartonella-free splenectom- ized voles may be 10 days. Maximum numbers of parasites are present usually 1 to 3 days after their initial appearance, succeeding which period there is a long interval when the number of parasites fluctuates widely. Visible infection may last for 6 months in the splenectomized vole; and the blood remains infectious even longer. Despite massive blood infections, no marked anemia nor any mortality was observed, and sections of various organs stained with Giemsa disclosed no marked patho- logical changes. There was no indication whatever of multiplication in fixed endothelial cells. Parasites were occasionally found in blood leucocytes of the monocyte type; their occurrence in all probability resulting from phagocytosis. In Giemsa-stained film the appearance of H. microti is reminiscent of H. canis. In addition to the rod and granular forms common to all the haemobartonellae, this species also possesses rings and ovoids, diamond- or flame-shaped small forms as well as coarse seg- mented or unsegmented filaments up to 5,u in length (plate I, fig. 5). The filaments may contain one or more rings in their substance, at other times the rings are arranged in rows suggesting the same origin. Similarly the filaments may be composed in part or entirely of diamond-shaped, coccoid, or ovoid elements, sometimes in parallel rows. Such chains of elements also frequently show a striking peculiarity in that the elements are all uniformly turned with their long axes at an angle, frequently of nearly 900, to the direction of the filament. When such a chain is situated on the margin of a red cell with the flame-shaped end extend- ing into the plasma, it presents a saw-toothed appear- ance. The coccoid forms, usually scattered, may occur as aggregates or clumps on the red cell, apparently im- bedded in a faint blue matrix. Similar pale blue veil- like substance may cover nearly half of one surface of the red cells and show at its border typical red-violet</page><page sequence="73">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 313 stained rods or filaments. A bow-shaped arrangement of elements is characteristic, the "haft" being formed by a curved filament which may be segmented into rods, the "string" by a row of rods or coccoids. In the concavity of the bow, the pale blue veillike sub- stance may occur. Concerning the filiation of these forms it seems clear that the chains of rods and ovoids are derived from the segmentation of filaments, likewise that the rings and coccoids may arise from the filamentous forms. It ap- pears likely that the rods may also arise by binary di- vision, and that the minute coccoids derive from certain ring forms showing numerous granular swellings. The greatest variety of form was found in the heavier infections obtained in mice (vide infra). The presence of ring forms in intense infections might sug- gest a mixed infection with eperythrozo6n in either the vole or the mouse, or in both. However, ring forms were found in inoculated splenectomized mice free from Eperythrozoon coccoides, and the eperythrozoon (E. dispar) of the vole does not infect mice. The true source of the ring form in unmixed infections has been described above. Rings have also been described in other bartonellae: B. bacilliformis (p. 268) and H. canis (p. 310). The extreme polymorphism in the blood contrasts sharply with the rather monotonous uniformity of the organism in culture. Stained cultures indeed had a general appearance which would not permit of differ- entiation from B. bacilliformis or H. tyzzeri. Macroscopic growth was evident in semi-solid serum agar two weeks after inoculation with citrated or heparinated blood and incubation at about 230 C. or at 32?. Then, white rounded masses measuring up to about 1 mm. in diameter developed in the upper 15 mm. of the tubes. The colonies, in the initial cultures, ap- peared to be limited to those regions where inoculated blood was present. Stained, the parasites were found to occur in clumps or clusters varying in size from several to 15 and more microns in greatest dimension; Individual organisms were most commonly fine rods, lu to 2,u long and about 0.3,u wide, sometimes occurring in chains. Small round forms measuring 0.5,u in diameter were not uncommon; larger round disklike structures, several microns in diameter and intermingled with rod forms, were rare. Two-week-old cultures have proved infectious for splenectomized Swiss mice. After an incubation period of two weeks or longer, rare infected red blood cells were found containing parasites. Massive blood in- fections, such as those obtained by inoculation of large doses of infective blood, have not yet been obtained by the inoculation of cultures. In tissue culture H. microti grows in small, rounded compact masses within the cytoplasm of infected cells, giving a general appearance very similar to that of B. baciliformis (p. 271) and H. tyzzeri (p. 315). There is some variation in the adaptability of H. microti to life on artificial media, successful culture is not always obtained, and thus far indefinite maintenance of those strains isolated has not been possible."' Viability, as distinct from growtll, on semi-solid medium is limited. Parasitized blood kept on this medium at room temperature did not develop colonies, and did not infect splenectomized mice after 5, 10, and 16 days (Tyzzer, 1942). Despite the close resemblance between H. microti and H. canis, two splenectomized dogs showed no bar- tonellae after inoculation; other splenectomized animals found refractory were the white rat, which develops neither evident nor latent infection, and deer mice of two species (Peromyscus eremicus and P. leucopus). Conveniently enough, however, the splenectomized white mouse is readily susceptible, and 7 to 12 days after blood injection usually has a heavy infection. It is important, however, to use mice free from Epery- throzoon coccoides, since E. E. Tyzzer (1941a) has demonstrated that the latter organism may "interfere" in mice in the development, of inoculated bartonellae, prolonging the incubation period sometimes to many weeks (see p. 318).1? In the mouse the morphological range was extreme, being often far more marked than in the natural host, the vole. Indeed, from appearance alone H. microti would often not be recognized as the same organism in its two' different hosts. This datum indicates clearly enough that attempts to identify species of haemobar- tonella on morphological grounds alone, without speci- fying the host, are not justified. The natural mode of transmission has not been de- termined. While Dermacentor variabilis often infests Microtus pennsylvanicus, some bartonella-infected ani- mals were obtained from areas where ticks are unre- ported; mites were common ectoparasites of these animals. HAEMOBARTONELLA STURMANI OF THE BUFFALO (GRINBERG, 1939) H. sturmani was described by Grinberg (1939) in Palestine. Parasites appeared one month after splen- ectomy of an anaplasma-infected animal. Visible in- fection lasted two to five days, latent infection at least one month more. The organisms occurred individ- ually, irregularly in clumps, and also in chains stretch- ing across the cell. Bacillary forms were most com- mon, cocco-bacillary and "almost coccoid" forms were 16 Tyzzer (1942), because of the usual failure obtained in cultivating H. microti, considers it not proven that the isolated organism actually was H. microti and suggests that it possibly may have been the grahamella of the vole. However, visible blood infection was produced in mice by the inoculation of this culture, whereas numerous inoculations of grahamella cultures have never done so. Furthermore, the cultural characteristics differ, since this organism died out after transfers, whereas the grahamella is easily subcultured. 17In the vole, E. coccoides exerts no "interference" against H. microti.</page><page sequence="74">314 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY also reported. The length varied from 0.5pu to 1-.5u, and 1 to 15 organisms were found parasitizing a single erythrocyte. H. sturmani apparently may be somewhat patho- genic after splenectomy, although it has not been ob- served in animals clearly free from anaplasma; slight anemia, fever, increase in the bleeding time, and refusal of food were noted. Transmission to the young splenectomized buffalo was successful after inoculation of blood. No infection resulted from similar inoculations of the following splenectomized animals: rabbits (2); calves, apparently free from H. bovis (2) ; hamsters (4). Numerous lice (Haematopinus tuberculatus), removed from an infected animal, were injected into a splenectomized buffalo with no resulting infection. HAEMOBARTONELLA TYZZERI OF THE GUINEA PIG (WEINMAN AND PINKERTON, 1938) H. tyzzeri was noted in 1937 (Weinman and Pink- erton) in splenectomized Peruvian guinea pigs investi- gated for susceptibility to B. bacilliformis. It was found to be a new species in 1938 (Weinman and Pinkerton), when details regarding host specificity and cultural characters were given. Mayer and Zeiss had previously (1920) seen erythrocytic structures in guinea pigs infected with Trypanosoma rhodesiense and treated with Bayer 205. These bodies had the appearance of bartonellae but were interpreted as being the result either of action of the drug or of the disin- tegrating trypanosomes. Since identical treatment of rats latently infected with H. muris renders this in- fection evident (p. 306), it is possible that Mayer and Zeiss were experimenting with animals carrying a spontaneous bartonella infection. Campanacci (1929) and Rybinsky (1929) described bodies in the blood of non-splenectomized guinea pigs, which they considered to be bartonellae (B. caviae Campanacci and B. ukrainica Rybinsky). However, evidence that these structures were living organisms was not suggested by animal passage or proved by cul- ture. Neither author furnished illustrations of the structures encountered. Until it can be determined just what they represent, the names B. caviae and B. ukrainica should be considered invalid specific desig- nations. Klein, Lopatizki, and Solitermann (1930) saw, in the red cells of splenectomized guinea pigs, bodies which were almost always coccus-shaped, with some rare rod forms; they were occasionally seen in the plasma. Non-splenectomized guinea pigs, injected both with such blood and with typhoid cultures, showed these bodies in the blood. They were considered to be bartonellae which were not named. Schwetz (1934c) reviewed this work critically and concluded that it had not been shown that guinea pigs were parasitized by a bartonella of their own. He pointed out that red- staining bodies may occur in the erythrocytes of normal guinea pigs, that splenectomy had no notable influence on these bodies, and agreed with the conclusion of Wenyon and Low (1914), who had previously studied these structures, that they are probably nuclear rem- nants, Unlike the other haemobartonellae, H. tyzzeri has not yet been found to be widely distributed. It was observed in the common guinea pig, Cavia porcellus, obtained in Peru; also apparently the same species was encountered in Colombia (Groot, Mayoral, and Mar- tinez, 1941; Groot, 1942), whereas splenectomized guinea pigs have been examined for bartonellae with negative results by Noguchi in New York (1928a), Schin in Korea (1930), Schwetz in the Belgian Congo (1934c), Bacigalupo in Buenos Aires (1934), Wein- man and Pinkerton in Boston (1938), and Samper and Montoya in Bogota, Colombia (1940). The organism has been observed in latently infected animals only after splenectomy. Thus, in the blood of 15 non-splenectomized Peruvian animals no para- sites were found, while 4 of 23 animals (about 17 per- cent) manifested visible infection after splenectomy. The incubation period in the latently infected splen- ectomized animal was 5 to 9 days; somewhat longer (12 to 15 days) after splenectomy and subsequent in- fection. H. tyzzeri is extremely well tolerated by its host. Howell-Jolly bodies and polychromatophil cells oc- curred, but with about the same incidence seen in splenectomized non-infected animals. No blood cells indicative of marked anemia were regularly encount- ered. Erythrophagocytosis of infected cells was ob- served, but rarely. Haemoglobinuria did not occur, and no mortality has resulted from the infection. Para- sites remained visible in blood films for a period varying between a few days and a month; after their disap- pearance the blood remained infectious for-at least two months. H. tyzzeri stained red violet with Giemsa's solution and then appeared as single or composite rods varying from 1.4u to 4.0u in length by about 0.25,u in width. The two poles were frequently enlarged, while the ordinarily smoothly regular surface occasionally showed granular swellings. Short rods, 0.8, by 0.2,4 to 0.3,u, also were found, and round forms with a diameter of 0.2,4 to 0.3,u occurred in some animals, usually in pairs. The distribution of the organism in regard to the red cells was irregular; no clumps were seen. Infected cells were never numerous, not more than 0.1 percent being observed in any animal. Each in- fected cell carried from 1 to 15 organisms but other- wise appeared normal in shape, hemoglobin content, and staining reaction. No cell other than the erythro- cyte was found infected. No organisms were encoun- tered in leucocytes except for those infecting phagocyted red cells, nor in vascular endothelial cells of spleen, liver, lung, and kidney examined in Giemsa-stained films and sections.</page><page sequence="75">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 315 Cultures were obtained in media both with and with- out cells. With the use of Noguchi and Battistini's semi-solid serum agar, initial cultures were obtained in 4 of 11 cases. In this medium, inoculated with citrated blood and incubated at 260 C., colonies commonly de- veloped in 2 to 3 weeks. They appeared as numerous white isolated spheres, not becoming much larger than 1 mm. in diameter, which grew in a zone of varying width whose upper border was about 8 mm. below the surface of the medium. The organisms stained dis- tinctly with Giemsa's stain and did not retain the violet with Gram's technique. They occurred both as iso- lated individuals and in microscopic clumps of varying size, often measuring 10,u to 20,u from edge to edge. Individual organisms in such aggregates were most clearly discerned at the periphery as rods or granules, giving a general appearance entirely comparable to that of B. bacilliformis in culture. In the clumps of some cultures, larger round structures, varying in size from 0.5,u to 2.Ou in diameter and staining a reddish or a bluish violet with Giemsa's stain, were also ob- served. Similar structures have also been seen in cultures of B. bacilliformis. Indefinitely prolonged maintenance on semi-solid medium has not yet been obtained. Cultivated in association with tissue, H. tyzzeri de- velops both inside the cytoplasm, producing clumps in heavily infected cells, and extracellularly, here also producing an appearance indistinguishable from B. bacilliformis (p. 271). It is to be noted that under these artificial conditions intracellular development was marked, while in vivo tissue cells were never found to be infected. A successful method for obtaining such growth is to soak fragments of tunica vaginalis from a normal guinea pig in infected blood, then to place the tissue on Zinsser, Wei, and Fitzpatrick's serum-Tyrode- agar slants (1937). After 6 to 8 days, marked intra- cellular growth will have taken place; on about the 15th day pin-point colonies will be visible between the tissue fragments. Cultures were infective for guinea pigs. On semi- solid medium they remained so for at least 8 weeks and retained their infectiousness after 2 weeks' refrigeration at about 100 C. The incubation period after the in- oculation of cultures on both types of media was the same as for infective blood. Only the guinea pig has been found susceptible to infection with H. tyzzeri. This organism can thus be distinguished from other bartonellae by the inoculation of other animals. Although, like B. bacilliformis, it occurs in Peru, and although the two in cultures have identical appearances both in cells and in the cell-free medium, they are distinct organisms. Thus, Macaca mulatta monkeys inoculated with blood or with cul- tures have neither evidenced visible infection nor given positive blood cultures. Conversely, cultureg of B. bacilliformis, injected intraperitoneally into six splen- ectomized guinea pigs, did not result in the appearance of parasites in the blood. Similarly it is not H. muris, for H. tyzzeri produces no visible infection after in- jection into splenectomized bartonella-free rats, and conversely H. muris has been reported (p. 301) not to infect the guinea pig. From H. canis it is distinguished by the non-receptivity of the splenectomized guinea pig to the dog bartonella (p. 311). Particular attention should be directed to the possi- bility of spontaneous bartonella infection in guinea pigs used for typhus experiments. Rickettsia prowazeki not only is morphologically similar to the guinea pig bartonella but is often cultivated in vitro in the pres- ence of guinea pig cells in which both organisms de- velop. Mixed cultures could be detected by noting cluster formation produced by H: tyzzeri in heavily infected cells and by the possibility of obtaining grow- ing subcultures in cell-free medium. It may be noted that the natural mode of transmis- sion is as yet unknown. In the region of Peru where the parasite was discovered, guinea pigs were abund- antly infested with fleas. HAEMOBARTONELLAE OF UNDETERMINED SPECIFIC RANK The micro-organisms discussed here will be grouped according to host of origin. They are considered to be haemobartonellae from the description of the original author but the information furnished is not sufficient for further classification. WILD RATS 18 In the wild rat, bartonellae similar to H. muris have been observed by Ford and Eliot (1928b) in Balti- more, Noguchi (1928a) in New York, Dinger (1929b) 18The nomenclature of rats and mice appears unsettled; the synonymy, complicated and hampering. Many authors do not give the technical name of the host, and it is thus impossible to identify it accurately. Others employ antiquated nomenclature. Under these circumstances we shall reproduce the generic and specific names as given by the various authors. At the same time we offer the following list, in which the name currently accepted by systematists is given first; this is followed by the original designation (in parentheses) and by the common name or names. Rattus rattus rattus (Linnaeus) (Mus iattus Linnaeus, 1758). Black rat.. Rattus rattus alexandrinus (R. Geoffroy) (Mus alexandrinus R. Geoff roy, 1803). Roof rat (a gray form of the black rat). Rattus rattus frugivorus (Rafinesque) (Musculus frugivorus Rafinesque, .1814). Cream-bellied house rat. Rattus rattus diardii (Jentink) (Mus diardii Jentink, 1880). Malaysian house rat. Synonym: Mus griseiventer Bon- hote, 1903. Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) (Mus norvegicus Berken- hout, 1769). Norway or brown rat. Synonym: Mus de- cumanus Pallas, 1778. Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus) (Mus sylvaticus Linnaeus, 1758). Field mouse. The above nomenclature was kindly furnished by Dr. Francis Harper.

In Mus decurnanuts they were reported by Joncheres (1929), and by Bonnin and Joncheres (1929) in 100 percent of their animals, by Vassiliadis (1930, 1934) in Louvain and in Suez, and by Reitani (1930d) in the Piedmont. Bonnin and Joncheres found a con- stant anemia similar to that of'the white rat, with 3 deaths among the 20 infected animals. On Noguchi's medium, growth was not obtained. Vassiliadis (1930) transmitted the infection to splenectomized white rats by means of the rat louse, either by injection or simply by placing lice upon them. Mus norvegicus: Bacigalupo (1934) found this spe- cies infected in Buenos Aires. Two of three wild gray rats died after splenectomy, showing heavy bartonella infection (Bacigalupo and Pardina, 1932). The "gray rat, Rattus rattus frugivorus": Schwetz (1934b) in Stanleyville, Belgian Congo, found 31 of 43 splenectomized animals harbored bartonellae, which were transmitted to an unoperated young gray rat, causing a rather intense disease with relapses, and, after subsequent splenectomy, proving fatal. The first report was made in 1930 (Schwetz and Cabu). Mus rattus griseiventer: Timmerman (1930) and Kirschner and Timmerman (1930) at Bandoeng, Dutch East Indies, found 10 percent of the normal animals infected. Forty percent of those splenectomized had a fatal anemia. The parasite infected white rats and white mice, both of which, after splenectomy, developed an anemia which was often fatal. The "black rat, Mus rattus rattus": Reitani (1930d) in the Piedmont district of Italy found bartonellae in 6 percent. Vassiliadis (1930) at Louvain found 9 of 10 black rats infected. The incubation period was 2 and more rarely 3 or 4 days; the mortality, 25 percent. Filtered blood was not infectious. Splenectomized white rats proved susceptible. The latter author (1934) in Suez found 3 of 4 Mus rattus infected. Schwetz (1930) reported 4 of 22 M. rattus rattus in- fected; the infection was slight, and relapses occurred. Mus sylvaticus: Vassiliadis (1930) in Louvain found some parasites before splenectomy; afterwards a very severe, sometimes fatal, disease developed. The white rat was not infected. Bruynoghe and Jadin (1931) confirmed these results, and since they did not infect the white rat but did infect the white mouse, they con- cluded that the parasite of M. sylvaticus is a different species than that of the albino rat. Mus acomys: 19 No parasites found in 5 specimens by Vassiliadis (1934) in Suez. ALBINO MICE Mayer (1921) observed in mice, infected with try- panosomes and treated with Bayer 205, erythrocytic 19 Apparently a misnomer. Perhaps some species of the genus Acomys. structures which persisted for several weeks and then disappeared; transmission experiments failed. In splenectomized mice, bartonellae were reported, apparently for the first time, by Noguchi (1928a) in New York, then later by Dinger (1929b) in Amster- dam; Lwoff and Provost (1929) in Paris; H. Meyer (1929) and V. Schilling (1929) in Berlin; Eliot and Ford (1930) in Baltimore; Schin (1930) in Keijo, Corea; McCluskie and Niven (1934) in Glasgow. Non-infected stocks are also widespread. The ma- jority of investigators have not thought it necessary or advantageous to separate the bartonella of the mouse from that of the rat. V. Schilling (1929), however, gave it the name "B. muris musculi var. albinoi." After splenectomy the incubation is one to three days (H. Meyer, 1929; Lwoff and Vaucel, 1931) until the parasites appear. The acute infection lasts fourteen days (Meyer); four to eight days (Lwoff and Vaucel). The latter observed a relapse between the third and the twenty-seventh day after the first remission. The pathogenicity is variable. The organism seemed harmless to H. Meyer and V. Schilling, and somewhat pathogenic to Eliot and Ford, while Lwoff and Vaucel and McCluskie and Niven (1934) observed cases of severe anemia. We recall that in mice H. muris of the rat shows a like variation in pathogenicity (p. 301). On the whole, the disease in mice appears similar to, though less severe than, that in the rat. Morphologically, Noguchi found the organism similar to H. muiris save that it is more granular and shows beaded formation. H. Meyer noted ring forms; con- comitant eperythrozo6n infection was not definitely eliminated. V. Schilling observed long rods and was impressed by the polymorphism of the parasite, which he compared to H. canis. Dinger (1929b) found para- sites not only in the blood but also in the spleen. In view of the morphological variety of H. muris, which is generally accepted to be a single species, the slight morphological differences noted in the mouse parasite seem, alone, an insufficient basis for the erec- tion of a new species. These differences, on the whole, are less than those recorded in different descriptions of H. muris. Cross-inoculation experiments would ap- pear more probing. We have noted the receptivity of the mouse to H. muris (p. 301). On the other hand, Lwoff and Provost (1930) infected the rat with the mouse bartonella and obtained a fatal disease. Finally, Dinger (1929) observed in his animals inoculated with H. muris certain forms larger than those usually met with in the rat. It appears, then, that the same species of haemobartonella may have a somewhat different ap- pearance in different hosts. Definite evidence of this has been obtained in the case of H. microti (p. 313). While the specific individuality of the mouse bar- tonella remains doubtful, it will be seen that infection in the mouse has one marked peculiarity: the ease with which both disease and a marked development of para- sites can be produced in non-splenectomized mice.</page><page sequence="77">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 317 This feature is attributable more correctly, perhaps, to a peculiarity in the host, of a physiological or im- munological sort, than to one of the infecting organisms, since it has been observed in mice infected with para- sites of both mouse and rat origin (p. 301). In non-splenectomized animals H. Meyer observed a few parasites from time to time. Lwoff and Provost (1929) inoculated a normal mouse with dog blood con- taining Trypanosoma cruzi. The dog, in turn, had been infected by the injection of rat blood, so that H. muris might also have been transferred to the dog. However that may be, the mouse developed with the trypanosomiasis a marked bartonellosis 16 days after inoculation. The bartonellae were passed in series to a large number of normal mice. Twenty-eight passages were made without losing pathogenicity, for one drop of blood diluted to 1: 10,000 sufficed. While the symp- toms and hematology are not described, it is stated that the disease evolved in a "constant" manner after the second passage: parasites appeared the second day, and as late as the sixth; the height of the infection was reached the fifth or sixth day, rarely the ninth; re- covery took two days. Positive inoculation results in non-splenectomized rats were reported; it is not known that they were free from H. muris. Lwoff and Provost and Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) report cultivation of this strain and obtained three sub- cultures on "Noguchi's medium." In the last named, growth was obtained in 14 days at either 220 C. or 370 C., and on NNN medium after 10 days at the same temperatures. In culture the parasite is said to resem- ble Noguchi's description of B. bacilliformis. Motile and non-motile forms were described; on the forty- fifth day the majority were non-motile. The inocula- tion of apparently unsplenectomized mice with the cul- tures produced a light infection. Vaucel (1929) and Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) refer to one stra;n as a "spontaneous strain," and to the other appearing after splenectomy as the "provoked strain." The two have the same morphology, relation to the red cell, pathogenicity, and evolution; the first, in normal, the second in splenectomized, mice. They are said to differ, however, in regard to immunity. A non-splenectomized mouse underwent a bartonel- losis (spontaneous) and survived; after splenectomy a second attack occurred (due to the "provoked" strain). Conversely, a healthy carrier (therefore supposedly free of the spontaneous strain), when splenectomized, developed an acute disease (provoked strain). Two days after the attack, it was re-inoculated with the blood of an infected splenectomized mouse (also "pro- voked" strain) with no obvious result, whereas the same animal was receptive to the blood of a non- splenectomized animal suffering from acute bartonel- losis (spontaneous strain). From these facts the above authors conclude that the two strains do not cross- immunize and are two immunological varieties. Finally Lwoff and Vaucel observed in a mixed infection with eperythrozoon the transformation of the provoked or slightly pathogenic strain into the spontaneous or highly virulent strain. From this fact and from the height- ened pathogenicity observed in concomitant infections with trypanosomes, they conclude that a micro-organ- ism in "associated culture in vivo" may acquire "by transfer" new antigenic properties. The evidence offered does not appear conclusive. Durieux (1936), with a strain of mice obtained from Paris and splenectomized in Dakar, observed bartonel- lae. The parasites could be transferred to unoperated animals, but with varying success. The author noted that the incidence of non-splenectomized animals re- fractory to inoculation was of the same magnitude as the incidence of spontaneous infections in that stock, and suggested that positive results were obtained only in previously uninfected animals. Additional evidence for this view came from experiments with local (Dakar) gray mice. No one of many of these animals showed spontaneous haemobartonella infection after splenec- tomy; therefore, presumably, the strain of gray mice was not premunized. The bartonella of the white mouse proved "virulent" for the non-splenectomized gray mouse. One of his virulent strains was without admixture with eperythrozo6n, while a strain of low virulence coexisted with the latter; these results are therefore at variance with those of Lwoff and Vaucel (vide supra). Pathology.-Domagk and Kikuth (1933) found the same "splenic nodules" and foci of lymphocytes in the liver as in the rat (q. v.). Vector.-Ctenocephalus felis did not transmit the infection either when injected or when placed on non- splenectomized mice (Vaucel, 1929). Therapy.-Sterilization is possible but more difficult to obtain than with rats. Kikuth (1932) reports a coefficient of 1: 5 with neoarsphenamine in the most favorable cases. Domagk and Kikuth (1933) report successful treatment with combined salts of arsenic and antimony. OTHER MAMMALS Haemobartonella glis glis. In 5 dormice 20 splen- ectomized during hibernation, Kikuth (1931) noted, after an incubation period of 6 weeks, during which the animals lost one-third of their weight, a very poly- morphous organism with both ring and rod forms. Two of the animals had visible parasites during 3 or 4 days; the latter then suddenly disappeared. One of these animals recovered, the other died of a relapse two weeks later. The remaining animals all died, show- ing a progressive anemia. Haemobartonella opossum was found in the marsupial rat (Metachirus opossuim) and the opossum (Didel- phys didelphys) of Brazil by Regendanz and Kikuth (1928). The animals also carried piroplasmas in as- 20 Identified as Glis glis by Kikuth, 1932.</page><page sequence="78">318 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY sociation with SPirochaeta didelphys as a latent infec- tion. The bartonellae were comprised of coccoids, more rarely rods or dumbbells, the size usually ranging be- tween 0.1,u and 0.24u. Some cells were completely covered with parasites, others were parasitized by only one or two. In Metachirus almost all of the forms were round. The bartonellae in both animals were considered to be one species. Various organisms, all judged to be haemobartonel- lae but as yet unnamed, and whose individuality has not, for the most part, been established, have been de- scribed. In Lophuromys ansorgei and L. laticeps, Schwetz (1934b) in the Belgian Congo observed a few bar- tonellae before splenectomy; after the operation, an intense infection with a polymorphous bartonella. The anemia was severe, but not fatal; relapses were ob- served during 75 days in 4 of 13 animals. Bartonellae were found only after splenectomy in 2 of 9 Oenomys bacchante editus, in 1 of 3 Praeomnys jacksoni, and in 8 of 15 Arvicanthus striatus; all of these suffered from severe anemia, which was fatal for the first named. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, the deer mouse, was found infected by E. E. Tyzzer (1941a) with a bartonella which is well tolerated by the natural host but is definitely pathogenic for splenectomized white mice. In the latter a regularly severe and often fatal anemia occurs, accompanied by pallor, weakness, and rectal temperature as low as 32.5 ? C., but not by hemoglobinuria. Death may take place during the first blood crisis or more rarely in a subsequent relapse. Rods and coccoids were the common forms. Sulfars- phenamine given subcutaneously in two successive daily doses of 2.5 and 1.25 mg. eliminated the bartonella infection in mice. It was with this bartonella that Tyzzer (1941a) first demonstrated the curious antagonistic effect of epery- throzo6n on haemobartonella infection. If a splen- ectomized white mouse carrying Eperythrozoon coc- coides is inoculated with the deer-mouse bartonella, the infection with the latter is abnormal in that: (1) the incubation period is prolonged; (2) the clinical picture is altered so that instead of the severe disease ordinarily seen, only a mild anemia is produced. If the epery- throzoon is introduced during the course of the bar- tonella infection, the latter disappears and recovery from the anemia is prompt. When the eperythrozoon passes into latency, relapses of bartonella may occur. This interference phenomenon was not observed in the splenectomized vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsyl- vanicus, a foreign host only very slightly receptive to E. coccoides. In three Chinese hamsters, Cricetulus griseus, after splenectomy, Noguchi (1928a) found an organism very similar to H. muris. Anemia was noted in rice- tulus griseus fumatus, the dwarf Manchurian hamster, by Wu Lien-Teh and Jettmar (1930) in a mixed in- fection with a trypanosome. Vassiliadis (1930) did not find bartonellae in the hamster. Phodopus praedilectus and Apodemnus agrarius were both found infected; the former showed no blood changes despite heavy infection, the latter had a con- current trypanosomiasis, and 50 percent of the animals died (Wu Lien-Teh and Jettmar, 1930). Squirrels, Sciurus vulgaris, were splenectomized by Nauck (1927) in Peking. In 12 of 20 animals para- sites appeared 5 to 14 days later. Form and size were variable; rings, rods, and comma forms were seen. They stained red violet with Giemsa's stain; at times they invaded almost all the red cells and were also found in the plasma. Inoculation of the splenectomized squirrel succeeded; that of the white rat failed. Cul- tures were not obtained. Nauck thought the parasite might have been bartonella; also, more than one para- site may have been involved. Mixed infections.-Wliat may prove to be mixed in- fections of grahamella, haemobartonella, and eperythro- zoon were observed in the splenectomized jerboa (Springmaus) by Kikuth (1931, 1932), and in various rodents by Schwetz. It is possible that the very poly- morphous parasites described above (H. glis glis, H. opossum, and those in the squirrel) may also result from mixed infections. In the young, non-splenectomized gerbille, a fatal anemia was observed by Shousha and Aly (1928) in Cairo. Bacilliform bodies measuring 1.5/L to 2 by 0.25,u were found in the blood, where, on the erythro- cystes, they stained a bluish purple with Giemsa's stain; red, in the plasma. As many as 20 organisms were found parasitizing one red cell. The authors consid- ered that it was either a grahamella or a bartonella. However, it is not yet established that grahamellae are pathogenic. Had splenectomy been performed, we should have anticipated in a grahamella-carrier little or no change; in bartonella infection, a marked increase in numbers, in severity of symptoms, and in morpho- logical variety. The gray rat, Rattus rattus frugivoruts, the wild rat, and the splenectomized wild mouse harbor parasites of variable morphology which Schwetz (1933, 1934a) noted. He then posed the problem, without solving it, of the relationship of these forms to the bartonellae and eperythrozoa. Before splenectomy fine coccoids and delicate rods were almost the only forms seen. After the operation, in addition to the usual forms of haemobartonellae, this author describes rows of large coccoids, half-disk forms situated on the margin and strongly stained, large comma-shaped forms, rings with tail attached and "specks" (= "mouchetures"). The author pays par- ticular attention to this last form, which might prove to be a new group of organisms. They are round or oval bodies, appearing like disks, staining uniformly in a dull red and of variable size. Sometimes a small "speck" may be in contact with a larger one; in that</page><page sequence="79">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 319 case the larger may stain blue, the smaller, red. These bodies may resemble the solid staining eperythrozoa. All of these structures are depicted in a later, profusely illustrated paper (Schwetz, 1934d). The infection is accompanied by a bartonella type of anemia and evolves with relapses. This multiplicity of forms which was observed, not in laboratory-reared, but in trapped, animals, would suggest mixed infections; however, Schwetz believes that only one species with marked polymorphism is in- volved, for: (1) The forms change in the same subject; one day only specks are seen; the next, rods predominate. (2) The inoculation from one animal to another leads to a change in predominance of the forms. Both of the above facts might, with other emphasis, serve equally well to support the hypothesis of mixed infections. In regard to (1), we have noted that in certain experimental mixed infections the tendency is for one genus to interfere with the second, and they may alternate in the blood or appear together. In regard to (2), different animals show different susceptibilities to the parasites, dependent on (a) species of the host; (b) prior infection with the same parasite; (c) prior infection with other parasites. The question therefore still appears unsettled. Schwetz believes that these structures all represent a single micro-organism, prob- ably constituting a new group closely related to the bartonellae and eperythrozoa. No bartonellae have been reported from the follow- ing splenectomized animals: the rabbit (Noguchi, 1928a; Schin, 1930; Vassiliadis, 1930; Bacigalupo, 1934) ; the vizcacha (Lagostomuts wiaximius maximnus) and Reithrodon auritus (Bacigalupo, 1934); the giant rat, Cricetomys gambianus (Schwetz, 1934b); the gar- den dormouse, Myoxus nitela (Vassiliadis, 1930); Citellus intongolicus ramosus, Meriones kurauchi, and the jerboa, Dipus sowerbyi (Wu Lien-Teh and Jettmar, 1929). In the splenectomized monkeys, Macacus rhesus (Noguchi, 1928a; Weinman and Pinkerton, 1937) and the Java monkey (Noguchi, 1928a), no haemobartonel- lae were found. Wills (1935-1936) observed barton- ellalike bodies in the blood of 4 splenectomized M. rhesus monkeys suffering from a mild anemia. As she well states, "Till the bodies can be transmitted to other animals or cultured, their nature must remain in doubt." HAEMOBARTONELLALIKE STRUCTURES IN NON-SPLENECTOMIZED MAMMALS AND COLD-BLOODED ANIMALS Various bodies bearing a resemblance to the haemo- bartonellae have been described in a variety of other animals. Often their parasitic nature has not been demonstrated, or again their proper classification in the genus Haemnobartonella has not been established, while in still other cases several different parasites appear to be involved. We list them as they occur in (1) non- splenectomized mammals and in (2) cold-blooded ani- mals.

They occur in various vertebrates, producing an infec- tion which is usually evident at first, then passes into the latent state. The spleen is an important factor in maintaining this latency; splenectomy being habitually followed by relapses. Eperythrozoon infections may often be eradicated by treatment with organic arsenical and antimony compounds. Experimental transmission is readily accomplished by the inoculation of infected blood; natural transmission by an arthropod vector is known to occur. Although cultivation in vitro, permitting of indefinite serial transfer, has not yet been achieved, the results of animal inoculations, the response to chemotherapy, the transmission by arthropods, and other data leave little doubt that these structures are living organisms. Eperythrozo6n, like the parasites which it resembles, has variously been considered a protozo6n or a bac- terium. Both Mesnil (1929) and Neitz, Alexander, and Du Toit (1934b') noted resemblances to Ana- plasma. They then drew opposite conclusions: Mesnil thought it was probably a bacterium; the latter authors, probably a protozo6n. It must be admitted that pres- ent knowledge is not sufficient for a final solution of this question. While the available evidence indicates bacterial affiliations and no certain protozoan charac- ters, it is only the result of culture and full knowledge of the life cycle of the organism which may permit a final conclusion to be drawn. Further affiliations and classification have been con- sidered elsewhere (chapter II, pp. 288-289). As has been noted, the differential diagnosis with certain spe- cies of Haemobartonella may present difficulties. The following criteria have proved of value. In contradis- tinction to haemobartonella, eperythrozo6n is charac- teristically round with numerous annular and disk- shaped elements. Its rod forms are short and un- branched and on the surface of the red cell; rods are rare and not disposed in chain formation. Through- out visible infection eperythrozoa occur with about equal frequency on the erythrocytes and in the plasma. Certain distributions are characteristic: (1) raft- or swarmlike collections on the surface of the red cell, each element presenting its broad side in face view; (2) 320</page><page sequence="81">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 321 forms seen in profile view applied to the margin of the erythrocyte, either at right angles or semitangentially. They then often encircle the cell, in part or in whole, the individual elements adhering closely, as if plastered to the red cell with their extremities close together, even touching, but rarely overlapping, giving the erythrocyte the appearance of being ringed. These differential nmorphological characters have thus far proved sufficient for classificatory purposes when pure infections were studied. It appears, therefore, to be advantageous at present to continue to consider the eperythrozoa as organisms closely related to, but ge- nerically distinct from, the haemobartonellae. HISTORY AND DEFINITION OF THE GENUS At about the same time, and independently, Schilling, Dinger, and Vassiliadis observed this parasite in mice. The published record of Schilling (September 23, 1928) antedates the others; accordingly, the name proposed by Dinger (November 30, 1928), "Gyromorpha mitus- culi," suitable as it is, becomes a synonym of Epery- throzoon coccoides. The eperythrozoa may be defined as microscopic blood parasites found in the plasma, on the erythrocytes, and at times within the leucocytes. They stain well with Romanowsky type dyes, and then appear as rings, coccoids, or short rods, 11% to 21% in greatest dimension, staining bluish or pinkish violet and showing no dif- ferentiation of nucleus and cytoplasm. The organisms are not known to retain the violet in Gram's method or to be acid-alcohol-fast. Arthropod transmission has been established for one species. SPECIFIC DIFFERENTIATION. THE TYPE SPECIES The species lhave been distinguished by: (1) infec- tivity for different hosts and (2) morphological char- acters. When parasites of identical appearance occur in hosts of different genera, they have been considered distinct species if not transferable from either lhost to animals of the other genus. Eperythrozoon coccoides Schilling, 1928, the type species, has all the generic characters. It is a commion, wide-spread parasite of the albino mouse, producing in this host a latent infection. After splenectomy the parasite multiplies and becomes apparent in blood films, usually in great niumbers. The predominating forms are annular bodies with clear centers, short rods, and dot and coccoid formns. The rings are typical of, but not exclusive to, this species. It has been transmitted easily to albino mice, irregularly to other mice, rats, and the rabbit, and not at all to other animals. ENUMERATION OF THE SPECIES Seven species have been named, as follows: Eperythrozoon1 coccoides (see p. 321) EpcrythroZoon dispar (see p. 325) Eperythrozoont leptodactyli (see p. 330) Eperythrozoont noguchii (see p. 326) Eperythrozoont ovis (see p. 326) Eperythrozoonz perekropovi (see p. 328) Eperythrozoon wenyoni (see p. 328) In addition, eperythrozo6nlike structures have been observed in man and other animals (p. 330). EPERYTHROZOON COCCOIDES HISTORY AND DISTRIBUTION First described by V. Schilling in 1928 in splenec- tomized white mice inoculated with Haemobartonella miuris, the organism was later found in non-injected mice. Schilling concluded that it was independent of H. muris, proposed the creation of a new genus, Epery- throzoon, and named this species E. coccoides. Subsequently the parasite has been found in white mice by numerous authors and it appears to have a very wide distribution. It has been reported from Europe: Germany (Schillinlg. 1928), Holland (Dinger, 1928), France (Perard, 1929a), England (McCluskie and Niven, 1934) ; from North America (Eliot and Ford, 1930) ; from South America (Oliveira Castro and Seiler, 1934) ; and from Africa (Schwetz, 1934d), where, however, its occurrence in rats and its morpho- logical peculiarities suggest that another species may perhaps be involved. MUSCULINE EPERYTHROZOONOSIS INCUBATION PERIOD The parasites appear after a variable period followN- ing splenectomy. Schilling (1928) gives extreme limits of 2 to 19 days. Two to 4 days appears to be the habitual interval (Dinger, 1929a; Eliot and Ford, 1930), while Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929a) found them 24 hours after operation. Prior to splenectomy they may occasionally be seen but are extremely rare and disappear abruptly (Schill- ing, 1928). The inoculation of non-splenectomized eperythrozo6n-free mice results in a transitory, scanty visible infection. The maximum is reached toward the fourth day, with about 1 parasite per 1,000 red cells, and the visible infection persists about 15 days (Wein- man, 1935). In some instances, latently infected ani- mals subjected to various experimental procedures (e. g. irradiation) manifest their infection even witlhout splenectomy. CLINICAL PICTURE AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY After removal of the spleen, the parasites multiply rapidly. Twenty-four hours after first appearance, 5 percent of the erythrocytes may be infected (Dinger, 1929a), while two or three days later eperythrozoa may be far more numerous than the red cells; all the latter are then parasitized, some with half a dozen or more organisms. At this time eperythrozoa are also very numerous in the plasma. The number then decreases.</page><page sequence="82">322 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Relapses, of variable duration, occur at irregular in- tervals during a period of three to six months, but para- sites are not so numerous as during the first crisis, anid between relapses they may be scarce or absent. The infection seems to produce no disturbance of general health nor loss of weiglht. Schilling (1928) supposed, from the great number of parasites found free, that there must be somiie hemolysis, but Dinger (1929a) found no support for this view and thouglht that the parasites occur initially in the plasma, and attach themselves to the erytlhrocytes later. McCluskie and Niven (1934) report a slight degree of anemia with 5,000,000 red cells (normal value 6,500,000), 80 per- cent hemoglobin, and an increase in reticulocytes; other authors, however, find the red counts normal (Dinger, 1929a; Eliot and Ford, 1930). Polychromatophile cells are increased, averaging about 5 percent throughout the infectionl (Weinman, 1935), and on them parasites are often particularly abundant (Dinger, 1929a; Eliot and Ford, 1930). Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) and lMLcCluskie and Niveni (1934) infer that the parasites cause polychromato- philia in the infected cells. However, since inl non- infected animals a marked degree of polychromatophilia follows splenectomy, this blood change cannot be due exclusively to the infection, and Dinger (1929a), in accordance with this view, envisages the preferential localization on polychromatophile cells as occurring subsequent to the production of such cells. A slight leucocytosis has been found by Eliot and Ford (1930), who report an increase in the neutro- philes and monocytes. Dinger in addition noted an initial eosinophilia, which was not found by Eliot and Ford. McCluskie and Niven (1934) did not observe any leucocytosis. Finally V. Schilling (1928) and Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929a) observed no blood changes at all. Thus increased polychromatophilia is the only con- stant hematological finding, and in this increase the in- fluence of splenectomy alone has yet to be evaluated. Pathological anatomy.-No lesions were found either by Schilling (1928) or by McCluskie and Niven (1934). The spleen appears to be enlarged in carrier mice, the average ratio of spleen weight to body weight being 0.64 percent, with a range of 0.12 to 1.35 per- cent, as compared with 0.38 percent and 0.19 to 0.58 percent in non-carrier stocks (Marmorston, 1935). In carrier males the spleeii was heavier than in females. However, some of the increase in spleen weight may have been due to concomitant haemobartoiiella infec- tion, found in about 15 percent of the carrier animals. No development of the parasites outside of the blood has been demonstrated. In the spleen, Dinger (1929a) described them in reticulo-endotlhelial cells; Eliot and Ford (1930) noted phagocytosis of infected red cells in the spleen but did not observe any subsequent "con- centration of parasites." In brain films of mice of carrier stock also infected with pleuropnetimonialike organisms, Findlay et al. (1939-40) recently reported structures similar to the blood forms of E. coccoides both in morphology and in staining affinities. It was not stated whether the mice presented visible epery- throzo6n blood infection, nor was the relation of the structures to red cells specified. PROTISTOLOGY HABITAT In the vertebrate host the parasite lhas been found only in the bloodstream and within phagocytic cells, where it appears to undergo no development. In the arthropod vector, neither is the localization known nor has it been determined whether multiplication takes place. MORPHOLOGY The preferred stains are of the Romanowsky type. After their use E. coccoides appears in stained blood films as rings, coccoids, and rods (pl. I, fig. 6). The majority of the parasites are rings of regular outline with clear centers, or, accordinig to Schilling (1928), solid disks wlhich stain more strongly at the periphery than in the center, thus giving the annular appearance. Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929d) believe that both trtie rings and biconcave disks "like diminutive red cells" exist. The rings are at times thickened at one or more places, giving a bipolar appearance (Dinger, 1928). From these portions, one or more straight or curved rods may extend to a distance of 15jL (Bruy- noghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d; Vassiliadis, 1930), giv- ing occasionally the tennis-racket appearance of bac- terial spores (Eliot and Ford, 1930). Rods are commonly found applied to the margin of the red cell and have been interpreted as rings seen in profile view (Schilling, 1928; Dinger, 1928; Eliot and Ford, 1930; McCluskie and Niven, 1934). When these marginal rods are numerous they frequently double the periphery of the cell, giving it a characteris- tic ringed contour. Rods also occur free in the plasma, and on the erythrocytes. The coccoids resemble the rings in color and distribution, but are less frequent and stain solidly throughout. Little internal strttcture is discernible. Certain forms show more intensely stained slight thickenings. Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) have described a chromatoid granule which, with Romanowsky type dyes, stains a distinct purple against the clear blue of the rest of the organism. Situation.-The parasites are found free in the plasma or on the red cells. The free forms are more abundant at the terminal portions of the film, owing perhaps to nechanical causes. When such plasma forms touch the margin of the red cell, the portion of the parasite in actual contact stains more heavily than the rest. Most authors have noted a predilection for the polychromato- phile cells; this is not, however, a constant finding (Weinman, 1935). The epi-erythrocytic position has</page><page sequence="83">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 323 been generally remarked. Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) illustrate what they consider to be a process of pene- tration into the cell and explain the polychroniatophilia as a result of this penetration. It is to be noted that the majority of parasitized cells stain normally (Wein- man, 1935). Also, should penetration of any con- siderable number of erythrocytes occur, evidence either of hemolysis or of some degree of anemia should fol- low, and we have seen that such is not the case. As McCluskie and Niven (1934) remark, parasites oii the under side of the red cell may appear to be intracellular. Phagocytic monocuclear cells may, in intense infec- tions, contain parasites. The latter are contained in the cytoplasm, are few in number, usually stain poorly, give no evidence of multiplication, and are probably dis- posed of promptly. The preceding descriptions are based chiefly upon material stained with dyes of the Romanowsky type. These have given the greatest satisfaction because of the number of parasites stained and the degree of con- trast with the red cell. Parasites are pale red or reddish blue after staining with Giemsa's fluid (V. Schilling, 1928; Dinger, 1928), or when the May-Gruinwald Giemsa technique is fol- lowed. Eliot and Ford (1930) found them reddish blue with Wright's stain. Manson's solution is ap- parently not very satisfactory. Bruynoghe and Vas- siliadis recommend Borrel's polychrome blue. Aqueous basic fuchsin and methylene blue will stain some para- sites, as will phenol fuchsin, but they are not acid- alcohol-fast. The methods of Neisser and Bohmer and Heidenhain's hematoxylin technique were not satis- factory (Dinger, 1929a). The parasite is Gram-nega- tive (Dinger, 1929a; Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d; Findlay et al., 1939) and gives a positive reaction for nucleic acid with the Feulgen technique (Findlay et al., 1939). On wet films fixed in Duboscq-Brasil's fluid and stained with Heidenhain's hematoxylin, or in blood fixed in Bouin's fluid, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with Mayer's hemalum, the organisms could not be found (Weinman, 1935). Bollinger's method shows no capsule (Dinger, 1929a). Fresh preparations.-Dinger (1929a) found the para- sites visible in the dark-field where no proper motility, but only Brownian movement, was observed; they were not stained supravitally by cresyl blue or azur II. Size.-Variations from 0.5[t to ly (Dinger, 1928) to as great as 1.4[t, with an average of 0.7, (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d), are reported. Dinger esti- mates the uncolored central zone at 80 percent of the total area. Multiplication.-Binary division was suggested by Schilling (1928), while forms suggesting budding were noted by Dinger (1928) and Eliot and Ford (1930). Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929d) consider that the small coccoid forms develop into the annular structures. Lwoff and Vaucel (1931) describe "plasmodial" forms which are stated to undergo simultaneous multipolar budding. These "plasmodial fornis" are, to judge from the illustration, the swarm- or raftlike epi-erythrocytic collections of other authors. These collections could, it seems, arise by simple division of single organisms. CULTIVATION AND VIABILITY The results of culture attempts have been allmiost uniformly negative. Dinger (1929a) has recorded one doubtful positive in many trials. The mediumi was composed of coagulated egg white in Locke's fluid, to which was added rabbit serum (15 to 20 percent), and fresh blood (rat, goat, or rabbit). Films of the culture did not show parasites, but the third subculture, five weeks after inoculation of the first tube, produced in- fection when injected into a single mouse, splenectom- ized two and one-half months earlier and found para- site-free. With other media, growth has not been reported: blood agar with rat, goat, or rabbit blood, glucose blood agar, human serum with Ringer's fluid on coagulated egg slants, semicoagulated goat or rabbit serum with a piece of coagulated egg white, Shottmiiller's broth with 8 percent peptone (Dinger, 1929a); "blood or serum media" (Eliot and Ford, 1930); agar, blood agar, ascitic agar (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d); Noguchi's leptospira medium and Wenyon's medium with organ extracts from mice and rats cultivated aerobically and anaerobically (McCluskie and Niven, 1934). Viability.-Citrated infected blood, kept at refrigera- tor temperature (50 to 10' C.) five days, induced typical infections in susceptible animals. At the end of ten days such blood was no longer infective (Wein- man, 1935). EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION AND HOST RANGE Infective material is furnished by blood containing visible parasites; also by the blood or spleen of carriers. Mice.-In splenectomized non-carrier mice (V. Schilling, 1928; Dinger, 1929a) or in animals sterilized by chemotherapy (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d), infective inoculations reproduce the spontaneous infec- tion. In parasitized splenectomized mice after the peak of the infection is passed, re-inoculation does not modify the infection (Weinman, 1935). Other animals.-Somewhat varied results have been reported. Usually animals are considered non-recep- tive if eperythrozoa do not appear after inoculation, a conclusion which is not justified. The adult rabbit, for example, which is apparently refractory, if splenec- tomized before or after inoculation, will show parasites in the blood (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929b; Vas- siliadis, 1930). In the summary given below, positive results were taken to mean visible parasites in the blood; they were, in general, obtained either with young normal animals or with splenectomized adults. Negative results in</page><page sequence="84">324 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY unsplenectomized animals are of equivocal interpreta- tion. Rabbits have been infected (Bruynoghe and Vas- siliadis, 1929b; Lwoff and Vaucel, 1931), and white rats are susceptible (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d; Eliot and Ford, 1930; Kikuth, 1932). Dinger (1929a) infected the wild rat, and Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929d) the wild mouse, but not the splenectomized dwarf mouse (Mus minutus).' The splenectomized American vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus, is usually refractory (Tyzzer and Weinman, 1939), but may occasionally be infected (Tyzzer, 1941a). Kikuth (1932) found the dog and rabbit non-susceptible, as did Vassiliadis (1930) the splenectomized hedgehog. Spontaneous infections in othcr rodents.-A parasite considered to be E. coccoides has been reported in: the wild mouse (Mus musculus) by Bruynoghe and Vas- siliadis (1929d) at Louvain and by Vassiliadis (1934) at Suez; the gray mouse (Oliviera Castro and Seiler, 1934); the gray rat (Muts decumnanus) and the field mouse (Mus sylvaticus) by Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis; the gray rat by Ortiz (1940), who transmitted the in- fection to splenectomized white rats; and Rattus rattits (Schwetz, 1934d). Galli-Valerio (1931) noted disk forms in one of his splenectomized gray mice (Miis mutsculus) shortly after splenectomy; during a relapse nine months later, the animal died. In the meantime the fur had become light in color and fell from the head and ears. In the absence of other parasites, Galli- Valerio attributed death to eperythrozoon infection; but some dietary deficiency may have been responsible. No spontaneous infections were observed in the fol- lowing: the white rat (V. Schilling, 1928; Dinger, 1929a; Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d); the black rat (Mus rattus) (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d; Vassiliadis, 1934); the guinea pig (Dinger, 1929a); and the rabbit (Vassiliadis, 1930). EPIDEMIOLOGY Spread of the infection through contact takes place, but in a somewhat capricious manner. Dinger (1929a) found all the mice in his laboratory infected except those in one cage; no explanation of this fact was apparent. Seven of the parasite-free stock were placed with in- fected mice in a cage too small for its occupants, thus assuring close contact. They were observed from three to four and a half months; four of the seven became infected. McCluskie and Niven (1934) placed two splenectomized mice together, one infected and the other not. The latter was examined daily for three months without showing parasites. TRANSMISSION Arthropod transmission.-Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis (1929d) collected lice (sp.?) from a white rat carry- 1 Micromys miniutis (Pallas). ing both haemobartonella and eperythrozoon, and placed the insects on a field mouse (Mus sylvaticus) and a white rat, both of them splenectomized and eperythro- zoon-free. Subsequently the two animals developed a double infection due to haemobartonella and eperythro- zoon. A natural vector for white mice was found by Eliot (1936) in the mouse louse, Polyplax serrata. Both nymphae and adults removed from infected animals and placed on clean ones transmitted the infection after an incubation period of 9 to 17 days. When several hours elapsed between the two feedings, the nymphae could still transmit the infection; but not the adults. It was stated that transmission was effected by feeding, but it was not specified how all other means (e. g., crushing of insects into abrasions of the skin) were excluded. Louse transmission appears, therefore, to be one means of natural transmission, but may well not be the only mechanism. The author has experimented with several different heavily infected strains of mice. In no instance were these mice louse-infected, although other ectoparasites were observed. In these stocks, therefore, some alternative transmitting mechanism, and a highly efficient one at that, was at work. In this connection, it is interesting to recall that Eliot and Ford in 1930 were also manipulating a strain of eperythro- zo6n-infected mice, yet they state "we have not yet ob- tained mouse lice with which to test the transmission by this insect." Negative results were reported for: mouse lice (two specimens) and a mouse flea, ground together and in- jected (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d); the rat louse (Eliot and Ford, 1930; Weinman, 1935), which died rapidly on mice before prolonged feeding was possible (Weinman, 1935) ; the rat flea, either under natural conditions or by injection (Weinman, 1935); the mouse mites, Mycoptes inusctilinus and Myobia musculi (Eliot, 1936). Con.genital transmission.-Prenatal infection appar- ently does not occur. Weinman (1935) removed four young mice less than 24 hours old from three mothers known to be infected. All the blood obtainable from the infant mice was pooled with the four spleens, and the mixture was injected into splenectomized parasite- free animals. The latter developed no infection during three weeks. In parasitized stocks of mice the young become in- fected only several weeks after birth. This would in- dicate that transmission does not occur through the milk. Thus Dinger (1929a) found that three nurslings from a cage where all the adults were infected did not show parasites subsequent to splenectomy. Weinman (1935) confirmed these observations on mice aged up to 33 days. The lack of infection of the young mice is not to be explained, however, on the basis of insus- ceptibility, through transmitted factors or otherwise, for 10- to 11-day-old mice are easily infected by the injec- tion of blood (Weinman, 1935).</page><page sequence="85">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 325 Ingestion.-Infected mouse tissue (liver, skeletal and cardiac muscles), even in half-gram doses, infected none of three susceptible splenectomized mice (Wein- man, 1935). The gastro-intestinal route appears then to be unfavorable under natural circumstances, and seems to indicate that when Arthropoda are involved in the transmission of E. coccoides, infection does not re- sult from ingestion of the ectoparasites. Likewise, the failure of suckling mice to become infected may be ex- plicable on this basis rather than on actual absence of parasites from the milk. FACTORS AFFECTING RESISTANCE Marmorston (1935) reported that non-splenectom- ized mice, subjected to X-ray irradiation or infected with lymphatic leukemia, inconstantly showed visible eperythrozoa. A plurideficient bread diet provoked neither relapses in splenectomized carriers nor visible infection in normal animals (Weinman, 1935). IMMUNOLOGY The immunological state produced in this infection is of the premunition type (see p. 304), and is similar to that obtaining in haemobartonella infections. Epery- throzoon coccoides produces a latent infection in normal mice, and may at any time be made manifest by splen- ectomy. Then, after an initial blood crisis, a return to latency occurs. Partial splenectomy (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929d) or ligature of the splenic vessels (ibid., and Dinger, 1929a) has the same effect as total splenectomy. The injection of a spleen suspension had no effect on the course of the infection (Dinger; Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis). The spleen appears to function by limiting multiplica- tion of the parasites. The mechanism of this action is obscure. No protective substances have been demon- strated in the serum of infected rabbits when tested in mice (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929b), or in that of white rats for clean animals of the same species (Eliot and Ford, 1930). Accordingly, an alternative hypothesis of splenic phagocytosis has been invoked. Some parasites are probably thus removed, since they have been observed in splenic phagocytes, and the micro-organism apparently does not develop in the spleen. Yet splenic phagocytosis cannot be accepted as an exclusive explanation of the observed facts. For, after splenectomy, the initial period of parasitic multiplication is followed by a return to latency. This is certainly not accomplished by the spleen! It may be that extrasplenic phagocytosis accounts for the post- splenectomy immunity. However, a demonstration that phagocytosis, splenic and extrasplenic, explains all the observed facts, has yet to be made. Superinfection, either of the splenectomized or normal carrier mouse (Weinman, 1935) or of the rab- bit (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1929b), effects no evident change. In the splenectomized rabbit, the im- munity appears to be heterologous, applying to re- inoculation with either E. coccoides or E. dispar, after previous infection with the other parasite (Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis, 1931). After sterilization of the infection by chemotherapy, no immunity persists and the animals are fully suscepti- ble to re-infection. Inadequate dosage is followed by spontaneous relapses. No transmitted immunity pass- ing from parent to offspring has been demonstrated, young mice of carrier stock being susceptible (Wein- man, 1935). The extraordinary "interfering" effect which E. coc- coides may exert on haemobartonella infections has been discussed (chapter II, p. 318). THERAPY AND CONTROL The infection may be eradicated with the same type of drugs effective against the haemobartonellae. The sterilizing doses ate: neosalvarsan 0.0025 gm. (2.5 mg.) for an animal weighing 15 to 20 gmi. Sulfars- phenamine at the same dose causes only a temporary disappearance, followed by recurrence in 15 to 20 days (Vassiliadis, 1931); whereas this initial dose, followed a day later by one-half the quantity (1.25 mg.), elimi- nated the infection (Tyzzer, 1941a). Vassiliadis further reports a temporary disappearance for four or five days with 0.02 gm. (2 cg.) of tryparsamide for a 20-gm. animal, and no activity from stibosan (2.5 mg.), tartar emetic (0.25 mg.), quinine sulphate (5.0 mg.), and germanine (5.0 mg.). Control.-For experimental purposes, eperythro- zo6n-free mice may be required. If only carrier mice are available, they may be sterilized by adequate treat- ment, including removal of ectoparasites (p. 302) and isolation. The choice of pregnant females for such manipulation should permit the isolation and mainte- nance of a parasite-free strain. - EPERYTHROZOON DISPAR A second species of eperythrozoon parasitic in rodents was described by Bruynoghe and Vassiliadis in dwarf mice (Mus minutus) and voles (Arvicola Microtus arvalis) captured near Louvain (1929d). In the vole the majority of parasites were solid disks with only an occasional annular form. In the dwarf mice the ring forms were described as being somewhat larger and more. delicate than those of E. coccoides. Neither of these parasites infected splenectomized white rats which were susceptible to E. coccoides, and conversely E. coccoides did not infect the splenectomized dwarf mouse. It was also found somewhat later that E. dis- par of the American vole does not infect splenectomized albino mice (Tyzzer and Weinman, 1939). These differences in host susceptibility and in mor- phology seemed to justify creation of a new species, and the name E. dispar was proposed. Apparently the parasites found in Mus minutits aiid Arvicola arvalis constitute only one species, for the vole parasite in-</page><page sequence="86">326 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY fected the splenectomized dwarf mouse. Since then, E. dispar has been reported in Mus acomys in Suez (Vassiliadis, 1934) and in the American vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicits (Tyzzer and Weinman, 1939). Experimentally, the splenectomized rabbit was sus- ceptible. After an incubation period of three to six days, visible infection lasted three to five days. When the infection became latent, re-inoculation with E. coccoides was not followed by reappearance of either parasite. When the order of incubation was inversed, the same result was obtained. Bruynoghe and Vas- siliadis (1931) interpreted this to indicate a close im- munological relationship between the two parasites. EPERYTHROZOON NOGUCHII This is a species proposed by Lwoff and Vaucel (1930), whose description is based wholly upon the appearance of certain objects in photomicrographs pub- lished by Noguchi. The nature of these objects being unknown, E. nogtchi,i does not seem to be a valid species. Brumpt (1936) considers "E. noguchii" a synonym of Bartonella bacilliformfis. EPERYTHROZOON OVIS HISTORY AND DISTRIBUTION Neitz (1937) considers it probable that De Kock and Quinlan (1926) observed E. ovis in splenectomized sheep as early as 1926. In the publication of the latter authors, the curious may find other and earlier refer- ences to structures which might be eperythrozoa. It seems probable that the parasite must have been en- countered many times prior to 1934. However, so far as the author is aware, recognition of E. ovis as a dis- tinct parasitic entity, and the consequent proposal of a new name for it, is due exclusively to Neitz, Alexander, and Du Toit (1934) who described this eperythrozo6n in a sheep used for heartwater experiments and sub- sequently splenectomized. The parasite has now been reported from South Africa (Onderstepoort), Algeria (Donatien and Lesto- quard, 1935), Iran (Delpy, 1936), France (Lafenere, 1936), and the United States (Jensen, 1943). OVINE EPERYTHROZOONOSIS E. ovis is distinctive in causing massive infection and disease prior to splenectomy. Clinical reports are not always concordant, owing probably not only to a certain variation in virulence of the organism but also to the frequency with which E. ovis occurs in conjunc- tion with other blood parasites (Babesia, Anaplasmiia, Theileria, etc.). The following description is based on the careful and extensive report of Neitz (1937), working with the South African strain in the apparent absence of complicating infections. INCUBATION PERIOD An average of 5 to 7 days elapses, with extremes of 2 and 27 days, before the first appearance of parasites. After splenectomy of latent carriers, eperytlirozoa re- appeared on the sixth day. CLINICAL PICTURE Pyrexia, anemia, and icterus, accompanied by visible parasites in the blood, are the conspicuous features. Fever may appear before the micro-organisms. It usually does not exceed 105? F., but may reach 1070. There is apparently no fixed type; continuous for three or four days, it may then become intermittent or re- mittent, or be quite irregular, particularly during re- lapses. Occasionally no pyrexia is observed. The anemia, however, is constant. Clinically, it becomes apparent by the usual pallor of the mucous membranes five to eight days after parasites are first visible in the blood. Within ten days the erythrocytes have been reported to drop to 1,000,0O0 per cc. (sic!- mm.3 ?), while there is a corresponding rise in the leucocyte count to 20,000 per "c.c." (mm.3 ?). The monocytes are increased both relatively and absolutely. Anisocytosis, polychromatophilia, punctate basophilia, Jolly bodies, normoblasts, and reticulocytes make their appearance. Erythrophagocytosis is marked. Hemo- globinuria was noted in one case. Graf (1937) found minimal hemoglobin values of 40 percent three weeks after infection. The red cell count showed "an enormous decrease, from about 10 X 106 to 2 X 105 i.e. more striking than the hemoglobin de- cline, pointing to a high color: count ratio." The total blood proteins decreased to 10 percent of normal, while the non-protein nitrogen rose at the acme of infection, owing chiefly to an increase in the urea nitrogen. "Bilirubinemia of the indirect van den Bergh type was present, generally also icterus." Hemoglobin regen- eration was slow, and three weeks after minimum read- ings it had risen to only 60 percent. In blood films, parasites may be rare when the anemic changes are most marked. Clinical icterus was observed in several animals, while dark yellow-colored serum was found in a larger number. Other symptoms were debility, dullness, in- appetence, panting, and a rapid weak pulse. At au- topsy the spleen was found constantly enlarged. In splenectomized carrier sheep, the course and char- acter of the disease are the same as during the primary infection. Parasites were found six days after splenec- tomy, then increased rapidly and reached maximum numbers five to ten days after their first appearance, being, at times, one hundredfold as numerous as the red cells. Evolution.-The duration of the disease is variable. Parasitic relapses are characteristic; they are accom- panied by clinical symptoms, occur at irregular inter- vals as late as 109 days after the primary infection, and subsequent to splenectomy as late as 15 months after</page><page sequence="87">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 327 the operation. From an examination of the case rec- ords, there is apparently a tendency to a progressive increase in the parasite-free period between successive relapses. A fatal outcome was exceptional under the favor- able conditions of the experiments, but has not been determined under field conditions. The preceding description applies to the disease ob- served in South Africa. In Iran the infection was ac- companied by fever and anemia. In France it was not notably harmful, while in Algeria the parasite was con- sidered entirely non-pathogenic. Donatien and Lestoquard (1935) found the behavior of the Algerian parasite otherwise very similar to the South African, and noted in carriers that concomitant Anaplasma ovis infection caused the appearance of E. OVtS.2 PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY AND PATHOGENESIS During the period of anemia, animals may present icterus of the subcutaneous and subserous tissues, as well as of the lung, liver, and kidney. The liver in addition shows signs of fatty degeneration. The spleen, constantly enlarged, is soft, red-brown in color, and, on section, shows extreme hyperplasia of the Mal- pighian bodies. No detailed histological report is yet available, but no organisms were found in endothelial cells of the jugular veins, nor in impression films of the brain (Neitz, 1937). At other periods of the infection, the findings are not remarkable. No macroscopic lesions were ob- served in animals presenting visible infection for several days but before anemia had commenced. After re- covery, splenomegaly may persist for six weeks. The anemia is considered to be due to red cell destruction of undetermined mechanism. Although hemoglobinuria occurs, Graf never observed hemo- globin in the serum by direct examination. Bone mar- row studies have not been published, but the report of numerous young erythrocytes in the peripheral blood does not indicate that medullary inhibition is of primary importance, if it occurs at all. PROTISTOLOGY DEFINITION AND HABITAT Prior to splenectomy, E. ovis provokes an intense in- fection in sheep which is often accompanied by anemia. Morphologically it is very similar to E. coccoides. Sus- ceptible hosts include sheep (Neitz, 1937), a species of antelope (Neitz, 1939), and perhaps goats (p. 327). Cattle are apparently refractory, but are the hosts of another species (pp. 328 et seq.). Natural infections were found in 15 to 30 percent of the South African sheep studied (Merino and Black- 2 Lestoquard and Donatien (1937) later restudied the Algerian parasite, considered it to be generically distinct, and proposed for it a new genus Erythrocytozoon. head Persian varieties) (Neitz, 1937). In this host it occurs on the erythrocytes and in the plasma; it has not been found in fixed endothelial cells (p. 327). No arthropod vector has as yet been demonstrated. MORPHOLOGY Delicate rings, 0.5, to 1.0,u in diameter, occasionally somewhat larger, staining pale purple to pink-purple with May-Griinwald Giemsa, are typical of E. ovis. Other common forms are stated (Neitz, 1937) to be triangles with rounded angles, and ovoid, comma, rod, dumbbell, and tennis-racket forms. Delpy (1936) found the Iran strain very polymorphous; in certain sheep almost only solid disks occurred, while in others, rods and rings were common. Neitz observed the parasites situated on or between the red cells. The epicellular position was further shown by centrifuging blood for one hour at 3,000 r.p.m., after which the majority of the parasites were found collected just below the leucocyte layer. When on the red cell, the eperythrozoa are often gathered in clusters. At the periphery of the erythrocyte, rod forms are applied to the margin to form a partial or complete ring. In some cases, from the groups of ring forms, a very fine fiber commences and is described as being drawn a variable distance over the cell like a veil. Multiplication, it was thought, might take place by budding, since small forms were found adjacent to larger ones, but actual budding forms were apparently not seen. CULTIVATION AND VIABILITY Cultures "on the usual laboratory media" were nega- tive (Neitz, 1937). The thermal death point is 500 C. for 10 minutes; the parasite survives 10 minutes at 480 C. Since these values are the same as for Anaplasma, heating cannot be used to separate the two (Jensen, 1943). EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION AND HOST RANGE Infective material is furnished by blood or organ emulsions which may be injected subcutaneously or intravenously. Experimental transmission to sheep was easily ac- complished. The non-splenectomized antelope, Dama- liscus albifrons, experimentally inoculated, has har- bored a latent infection 28 days (Neitz, 1939b). Goats, subsequent to infection with the Algerian strain, presented parasites in the blood; it is not stated that the animals were previously examined for spontaneous in- fection with a caprine organism (Donatien and Lesto- quard, 1935). Negative results were obtained with a splenectomized dog, rabbits, and guinea pigs (Neitz, 1937). Experiments performed with exemplary care showed a splenectomized calf to be non-receptive (Neitz, 1940). For 75 days after the operation, blood films were nega-</page><page sequence="88">328 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY tive. Then E. ovis was injected. Six days later eperythrozoa appeared. However, blood from this calf failed to infect three lambs and two splenectomized sheep. Later, four of these five animals were inocu- lated with E. ovis and found fully susceptible. Ap- parently the calf had become infected with the bovine species F. wenyoni. EPIDEMIOLOGY In South Africa, 15 to 20 percent of the sheep studied were spontaneously infected with E. ovis. The mode of transmission is not known, but by analogy, an arthro- pod is suspected. The frequent association in the same host of this organism and tick-born parasites (Rickett- sia rurninantiutm Anaplasmna ovis) suggests a tick as a natural vector. Sheep keds (Melophagus ovinus), removed from carrier sheep and injected intravenously into a suscepti- ble splenectomized sheep, did not give rise to visible infection (Neitz, 1937). IMMUNOLOGY The immune state resembles that found in the other eperythrozoon infections. Sheep react to E. ovis, then become latent carriers. The carrier state may sub- sequently be unbalanced by splenectomy, leading to a relapse. No cases of autosterilization were observed, and after induced sterilization by chemotherapy, ani- mals were completely susceptible to reinfection (Neitz, 1937). The immunity is thus typically of the premuni- tion type. The distinctive feature of E. ovis is its ability to provoke massive infection and disease in normal ani- mals, while for the majority of the other eperythrozoa splenectomy is essential in this respect. Whether this results from a particular virulence of this micro-organ- ism or from a relative physiological deficiency of the spleen of sheep, is unknown. THERAPY AND CONTROL Neosalvarsan, at sufficient dosage, caused disappear- ance of parasites from the blood within a few minutes. However, the effect was only temporary with the maxi- mum dose employed, a single injection of 45 mg. per kg. of body weight, and parasites reappeared 29 days later. Sdt 386 B (p. 307) therapy was not followed by relapses. Ten, 20, and 30 mg. per kg. were injected into three sets of two sheep each. Parasites vanished in less than an hour, and were absent for 110 days. At the end of this period the sheep were re-inoculated, and five of the six reacted like new animals (Neitz, 1937). From the high incidence of asymptomatic carrier sheep a more widespread distribution of the infection may be anticipated. Prophylactic measures are not available, since the natural mode of transmission is un- known. EPERYTHROZOON PEREKROPOVI Certain rounded bodies seen by Yakimoff (1931) in the blood of the pike, Esox lucius, were named E. perekropovi. This would be of very considerable in- terest as the first described species in a cold-blooded animal. However, it is not yet certain that these struc- tures should be classified in the genus Eperythrozoon. EPERYTHROZOON WENYONI HISTORY AND DISTRIBUTION Adler and Ellenbogen (1934) first, then Neitz and Quinlan (1934) in the same year, reported eperythrozoa in the blood of splenectomized calves. Nieschulz (1938) encountered parasites in calves which he tem- porarily identified as E. weniyoni. He considered, how- ever, that the organism was incorrectly classified gen- erically and consequently refers to it as "Bartonella wenyoni." An examination of Nieschulz's excellent plate of illustrations leaves little doubt that typical eperythrozoa were encountered; partictularly charac- teristic are certain chain formations applied to the mar- gin of the red cells and said to resemble Haemnobarton- ella caniis. Therefore one can only conclude that these organisms are what all other investigators term epery- throzoa. Since Nieschulz apparently accepts the valid- ity of the genus Eperythrozoon, it appears that his "Bartonella wenyoni" is, at least in part, a synonvm of E. zvenyoni. E. wenyoni has been encountered in Jerusalem (Ad- ler and Ellenbogen, 1934), in South Africa (Neitz and Quinlan, 1934), in Equatorial Africa (Malbrant, Bay- rou, and Rapin, 1939), in Iran (Delpy, 1936), in France (Cuille, Chelle, and Burlureau, 1935), and in the United States, in California (Hering, 1940) and in Louisiana (Jensen, 1943). Reported from Algeria by Donatien and Lestoquard (1937a), and from Hol- land by Nieschulz (1938) and Nieschulz and Bos (1939), in imported animals, it is not yet certain that the infection is established there. BOVINE EPERYTHROZOONOSIS INCUBATION PERIOD In non-infected normal animals, parasites appeared 16 to 22 days after inoculation, and somewhat earlier, 11 days, in splenectomized carriers (Neitz, 1940). In latent carriers also infected with Theileria annulata, splenectomy may be followed by visible eperythrozo6no- sis in two days (Adler and Ellenbogen (1934). CLINICAL PICTURE AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY In apparently pure infections in normal animals, E. wenyoni seemed only slightly pathogenic, occasionally producing a mild anemia without fever or clinical symp- toms. Parasites were usually rare, they persisted from one to seven days, no relapses were noted, and the whole infection would have passed unnoticed had daily blood films not been made (Neitz, 1940).</page><page sequence="89">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 329 In splenectomized cattle, apparently pure infections produce mild fever, weakness, icterus, and anemia ac- companied by leucocytosis. The red count dropped as low as 1,200,000 per c. cm. (sic!-mm.3?), and this con- dition was accompanied by anisocytosis, punctate baso- philia, and polychromatophilia. Jolly bodies, normo- blasts, and erythrophagocytes were also found. The leucocytosis reached as high as 37,000 per "c.cm." Symptoms were more marked in artificially inoculated animals than in carriers. The parasites persisted 8 to 11 days, and relapses occurred, as many as four having been noted. Adler and Ellenbogen (1934), in splenectomized cattle also carrying Theileria annulata, noted a rapid increase in the number of eperythrozoa; in six days after their first appearance 90 percent of the red cells were infected, and as many as 60 parasites were found on one erythrocyte. Clusters of parasites were also oc- casionally found within large mononuclears. Visible infection persisted 13 days. No pathological report of this infection has been found. PROTISTOLOGY DEFINITION AND HABITAT Knowledge of the biology of E. zwenyoni is still very incomplete, and an adequate definition of this species is not possible at present. This species does, however, seem to be distinct from E. ovis, as judged by cross- inoculation tests. The parasite has thus far been reported only in the plasma, on the erythrocytes, and within the circulating mononuclear morphology. It has not been studied in arthropods. MORPHOLOGY Adler and Ellenbogen (1934) found it very similar to E. coccoides, from which it differs in the following particulars. It is perhaps a trifle paler; on a single erythrocyte the eperythrozoa are sometimes superim- posed and present in greater number (Neitz, 1940); and E. wenyoni may be found in clusters within large mononuclears. Neitz was unable to demonstrate any morphological difference between E. wenyoni and E. ovis. Multiplication appeared to take place by budding and by fission (Adler and Ellenbogen, 1934; Neitz, 1940). Delpy and Rafyi (1938) describe an additional and most peculiar method of division. According to their account, the typical ring forms enlarge and become thickened at points. From each such thickening a filament may grow to a length of 5t to 1OI. The fila- ments are sometimes curved, may cross each other in various ways, and often appear as a tangled skein. Rings arise from these filaments, either at the extremi- ties or at thickened points, and in turn these rings may emit still other filaments. This peculiar mode of multi- plication suggested a superficial resemblance to the Hyphomycetes, and the authors accordingly state that E. wenyoni should not be included in the family Anaplasmidae. CULTIVATION AND VIABILITY Cultivation and viability studies have not been en- countered. EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION AND HOST RANGE Infection results from the subcutaneous injection of blood from an animal with patent or latent eperythro- zo6nosis (Neitz, 1940). Cattle are known to be sus- ceptible. Sheep apparently are not infected by E. wenyoni either before or after splenectomy (p. 328). Records of extensive tests on other animals have not been found. EPIDEMIOLOGY Arthropod transmission of the infection has been suspected. Donatien and Lestoquard (1937a) fed ticks received from Iran (Hyalonmma sp.) on two Algerian bulls. Later both animals developed infections with Theileria and Eperythrozoon. It is suggested that the ticks transmitted the infection. Proof is lacking that the eperythrozo6n infection did not antecede the tick bites and become evident owing to the theileriosis. While the frequent association of E. zcenyoni with tick-borne parasites has oriented search for a vector among these arthropods, Neitz (1940) considers it likely that ticks are not the only vectors, for calves raised under tick-free conditions became naturally in- fected. The ectoparasites common to these calves were lice: Bovicola bovis and Linognathus vituli. IMMUNOLOGY E. wenyoni also creates a state of premunition which may be interrupted by splenectomy. In normal ani- mals artificial inoculation is followed by brief scanty infection and minimal symptomatology; natural infec- tion is usually detectable only by splenectomy or sub- inoculation. Added infection may act as a partial equivalent of splenectomy; for Cuille, Chelle, and Bur- lureau (1935) noted parasites for 26 days in an animal suffering from anaplasmosis. With E. wenyoni, the spleen appears to prevent both development of the parasites and of the anemia. The anti-anemic action seems to be a subsidiary if not an exclusive result of the restricted development of the parasites. THERAPY Neosalvarsan was effective in causing disappearance of parasites from the blood stream at a total dose of 2.25 gm. for a heifer weighing 180 kg. The blood re- mained parasite-free for 112 days, but it is not known that sterilization was achieved (Neitz, 1940). A prod-</page><page sequence="90">330 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY uct known as Zothelone likewise caused rapid disap- pearance from the blood but was followed by parasitic relapses (Delpy and Rafyi, 1938). EPERYTHROZOON SPP. AND EPERYTHRO- ZOONLIKE STRUCTURES Human infection has been suspected in one instance. Schiiffner (1929) reported this case, in a child suffering from an anemia described as being of a pseudoleucemic, von Jaksch-Hayem type. Eperythrozo6nlike bodies were found in blood films taken at several days' in- terval and stained by the Pappenheim method. They were round, often ring-shaped, with the ring frequently thickened at one point, measured 0.24 to 1/, and stained a light red. There were also smaller, irregularly formed disks as small as dot-sized structures. The bodies were distributed chiefly in the plasma, sometimes grouped around the red cells in dense collections, but were rarely found on the surface of the erythrocyte. In his interpretation Schiiffner was most cautious and considered three possibilities. The structures were not a precipitate, since (a) they were in the blood layer rather than on it, and (b) various experimental pre- cipitates of serum gave no analogous image when stained with Giemsa. There remained the possibili- ties that the bodies were a cell product of some sort, or a parasite. If a parasite, the most similar organism was Eperythrozoon coccoides. In regard to the dis- ease, the possible infection might either be causally re- lated or have been latent and made apparent by the illness. It is unfortunate that no decisive evidence concerning the nature of these bodies is available. In other animals, parasites have been encountered which are either (a) definitely eperythrozoa but of uncertain specificity, or (b) eperythrozoonlike in some features but whose ultimate generic classification is yet to be determined. These are tabulated below. In this group belongs the parasite found and de- scribed by Carini (1930a) in the blood of Leptodacty- ins pentadactylus. Carini in 1930 placed it in a new genus Bertarellia and proposed the name B. lepto- dactyli. E. Brumpt (1936) reclassified it as an epery- throzo6n, and Lestoquard and Donatien (1937) ap- Host Author Remarks Jerboa sp.

These are intracytoplasmic bodies which are annular, round, or ovoid, and measure lt to 2,u. They are refringent and visible in fresh preparations, stain blue with Giemsa's fluid, and may show a more intensely stained granule. Vital stains such as Nile blue or neutral red produce good results. With cresyl blue a metachromatic effect is obtained; the larger structures show a dark blue granule moving rapidly within the remainder, which is pink-colored. There are only one or two elements in each parasitized erythrocyte, which is otherwise normal. The animal presents no symp- toms of disease. After splenectomy the structures multiply so that there may be 20 to 30 in an infected cell; they increase in volume and become difficult to stain. They are also very polymorphous, dumbbell, rod, and trilobed forms being found. In fresh preparations these bodies can be seen to move and change their form, a rod, for ex- ample, becoming a sphere. The animals passed into a state of cachexia and died, while the bodies increased even after death. The specific effect of splenectomy was, however, not demonstrated, for after any severe wound the same evolution was observed. Certain re- semblances to Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon were noted, but from Carini's description these para- sites appear to be too different to be included in these previously existing genera. 3The parasite has been recently named Eperythrozoon varians by Tyzzer (1942).</page><page sequence="91">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 331 BIBLIOGRAPHY PART II 1 ADLER, S. 1930a.

Causing at times alarming epidemics with high mor- tality, it is also established in widespread endemic cen- ters. In such endemic foci it has an important effect on the health of the population, and from these centers the possibility of dissemination constitutes an ever- present hazard. EPIDEMICS Misfortunes of the first magnitude, epidemics of bar- tonellosis have exerted a catastrophic effect on the life of the areas involved. For example, the Peruvian epidemic of 1870 involved only a very small region, but caused deaths estimated at 7,000 (Strong, Tyzzer, et al., 1915). In the more recent Colombian outbreak, 4,000 deaths were attributed to bartonellosis in the one year 1938 (Patifio, 1939b), and this in a single department whose estimated total population was only 100,000! It was not surprising, therefore, to find the Colombian representative, Dr. Patifio, reporting to the Third In- ternational Congress for Microbiology, that in his opin- ion bartonellosis was at that time one of the most dangerous diseases existing in the Americas (1940a). THE ENDEMIC INFECTION Long-time persistence, restricted geographical limi- tation, and, according to report, a lower death rate than in the epidemics, characterize this form. The territory involved constitutes the so-called bartonella or verruga zones. An example of how the disease tends to per- petuate itself in such foci is Guaylas La Baxa in Peru, described in 1630 in the earliest medical writing de- voted to the subject, and still a spot from which the disease is reported (Valdiz'an, 1925a; Rebagliati, 1940). 'This chapter is based principally on data presented in detail in chapter I, "Bartonella and Human Bartonellosis." Morbidity and mortality.-Precise statistics from the endemic regions are apparently not available. The disease is more severe in immigrants to the zone than in long-time residents. Recent investigations indicate that natiVes acquire their first infection in infancy or early childhood. Therefore, it is at the time of this first attack that it is important to establish the mortality, since the disease leaves some immunity after it, and it seems that by obtaining our death rates among adults we are dealing chiefly with survivors of the childhood disease. Even in the absence of notable epidemics, bartonellosis may still be an important cause of illness and death. Thus, of 695 entries in the hospitals of Lima for Carrion's disease, 147 died, a mortality rate of 21 2 percent (Kuczynski, 1937b). PRESENT EXTENT OF BARTONELLOSIS Bartonellosis is established in the western South American tropical zone, involving extensive areas of Peru and Colombia and portions of Ecuador. Within these countries the infected region is limited to the mountainous areas formed by the central and western cordilleras of the Andes chain. The bartonella zone is much longer than it is wide. Extending about 1,000 miles from approximately 20 north latitude to 130 south of the equator, it is of varying width, but probably never greatly in excess of, and often less than, 100 miles. Within this area the disease is irregularly distributed. It is found at moderate altitudes, the limits usually ly- ing between 2,500 and 8,000 feet, and in the vicinity of water, most often in narrow valleys or "quebradas" surrounding mountain streams. (See map, p. 249.) However, our knowledge of the extent of the disease in South America is probably quite incomplete, and should extensive surveys be made of areas with physical characteristics similar to those of the known bartonella 2 This rate may be somewhat high. Possibly only cases of some zravitv traveled from the bartonella zone to Lima. 339</page><page sequence="100">340 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY zones, we might find the boundaries considerably more extended than present information indicates. No proved indigenous case of the disease has yet been re- ported east of the Andes or from any other continent.8 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FACTORS Human bartonellosis is an infectious (and only ex- ceptionally contagious) disease, whose requirements for maintenance appear to be very simple, and involve man, the invertebrate host-a species of Phlebotomus (sandfly), and a source of Bartonella bacilliformtis. The present section is devoted to a study of these three factors in an attempt to show how by their interaction the epidemiological peculiarities of the disease arise. THE HUMAN HOST Man is the only animal, beside the insect vector, known to be naturally infected with Bartonella bacilli- formis.4 He functions in the epidemiological cycle in a dual capacity, not only as a patient and thus the object of medical preoccupation, but also as a source of infec- tion for the vector. It is therefore of prime importance to determine the survival of bartonella in man and under what circumstances the organism would be pres- ent in the peripheral blood and thus available to a biting insect. Fortunately, with the aid of cultural methods we are in a relatively favorable situation to determine these points. During both phases of the disease, bartonellae are present in the circulation. While in Oroya fever they may be very abundant and are often readily seen in blood films, during verruga peruana they usually can be detected in the blood only by cultural methods. It is not, however, only during the disease that hematic infection occurs. Inapparent infections.-As has been shown (p. 267), asymptomatic infections are not at all infrequent. About 10 percent of the apparently healthy residents of an endemic area have been found to be asymptomatic carriers. Since this result was obtained with a single culture from each individual examined, it is possible that the incidence of inapparent infections detected by repeated cultures would be somewhat higher. These carriers comprised persons with no history of the dis- ease as well as post-convalescents. Thus it appears that the relative immunity to the disease which de- velops after an initial attack is not necessarily accom- panied by sterilization of the infection, but on the contrary may co-exist with a state of latent infection. The length of time during which the infection may be harbored has not yet been the object of systematic in- vestigation. From the isolated observations available which bear upon this point, it is established that it may 30n p. 250 more information is given concerning dubi- ous cases observed in Central America and elsewhere. 4 Hertig (1942b) recently reported isolation of bartonella from one field mouse. last for many months, and some reports indicate per- sistance over a period of years. From the foregoing it seems justified to conclude: first, that man constitutes a reservoir of bartonella be- fore, during, and after the disease; and second, that since the organism is present in the peripheral blood, it is accessible to a blood-sucking insect. So, although future investigations may discover other mammalian hosts of bartonella, the human reservoir promises to be one of the chief epidemiological problems of this dis- ease. Another point of interest arising from the discovery of latent carriers, is that since they are not hospitalized nor even incapacitated, and are therefore perfectly able to travel, the human carriers, as well as the insect vector, are a means of conveyance of the infection. Since phlebotomus is usually not a strong flyer and does not therefore travel far, it would seem as though distant dissemination of Bartonella bacilliformis would be more likely to originate from the infected person than from the infected insect. Direct transmission.-In the preceding discussion the emphasis has been placed on man in his relation to phlebotomus, since in almost all cases it is through the insect that man acquires his infection. Although occa- sionally bartonella is transferred directly from man to man, contact transmission is an extreme rarity. Throughout a period of many years it has been observed that patients hospitalized outside of the bartonella zones do not transmit their infection to other patients or the personnel. Congenital transmission does take place, it is not known how often, but is probably not an essen- tial or even an important factor in maintenance of the disease. Thus, from the available evidence it does not appear that direct human transmission is a major in- fluence in bartonellosis. As a corollary, the conclu- sion seems justified that could the vectors in an endemic area be eradicated, the disease would tend to disappear without requiring any attention to the hu- man population. Concerning the incidence and severity of the disease, according to age and other groupings, not very much information is available. Bartonellosis is often con- tracted in infancy or early childhood by inhabitants of the endemic zones (Hurtado, 1939). In the new- born, the disease is often very severe (Odriozola, 1898). The effect on the infant mortality remains to be de- termined. Otalora (1939) considered bartonellosis an important factor in the increased infant deathrate seen during the Colombian epidemic. In older children, early reports state that the disease is milder, while in adults more severe cases are seen. This fluctuation in age resistance requires confirmation. Comparison of children, long-time resident in the zone, with adults recently arrived, does not in reality contrast comparable groups, since the children may already be partially im- mune from prior infection.</page><page sequence="101">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 341 Occupations.-Those which involve laboring in the infected areas may be particularly dangerous, and the hazards undergone by workers in such regions have led to the recommendation that bartonellosis be included in the Peruvian Compenlsation Law as an occupational dis- ability. Of such laborers, the railroad workers in the endemic zones in Peru were the most conspicuous ex- ample. "Every crosstie on the railroad represents a human life," it was said popularly in Peru. This par- ticular occupational risk has been subsequently reduced considerably by simple prophylactic measures. Sexual grouping.-While both sexes are affected, the disease is apparently more often fatal in males. Thus, according to Kuczynski (1937d), the mortality rate for males is 22 percent, whereas only 9 percent of the fe- male cases ended fatally. Previously unexposed persons.-As has already been pointed out, these individuals constitute a most suscepti- ble group, in whom the disease often evolves in its most malignant form, and the importance of such a group in the genesis of epidemics will be stressed. THE INSECT HOST We are far less well informed concerning the insect than concerning the human host. The important data thus far obtained have been gathered chiefly in the Rimac Valley of Peru. While this information will doubtless prove of value elsewhere, the degree of its applicability is not altogether certain. There, one or more species of phlebotomus are the only blood-suck- ing arthropods ever proved to be naturally infected with Bartonella bacilliformis. Their role as vectors of the disease is further indicated by the facts that they trans- mit the infection to experimental animals through their bite, that the incriminated species are known to attack man, and to feed more than once. These data were obtained with Peruvian species only, but it may be presumed that phlebotomus plays an equally important role elsewhere, since in the bartonella-infected area of Colombia these insects are common and live in close association with man. There is no reason at present to consider that any other arthropod is of importance in the transmission of bartonellosis. Experimental meth- ods have made possible the testing of other blood- suckers collected in the endemic areas, and in no in- stance has it been proved that they harbored Bartonella bacilliformis.5 Three species of sandflies have been found in the Rimac Valley-Phlebotomus noguchii, P. peruensis, and P. verrucarum. The last named appears to be the most important, so far as human bartonella transmis- sion is concerned (Hertig, 1938). P. verrucarum has been taken in buildings, which it enters freely, and also in out-of-door locations associated with animals, such as pigpens and sleeping places of dogs and guinea pigs (Hertig, 1938). These animals are not known to serve 5 More details are given on pp. 275 et seq. as reservoirs of Bartoniella bacilliformtis, but are im- portant as a source of food for the insect. In the laboratory, P. verrucarum feeds readily on mammals (Hertig, 1938). The life history in nature is not yet known in all its details. Bred artificially, this species requires about three months fromi adult to adult, at 200 to 230 C. There is no evidence of a diapause with any of the Peruvian sandflies (Hertig, 1942b). In the Rimac Valley it appears from the results of various in- vestigators that adults can be captured throughout the year. The flight range is not definitely determined, but according to Townsend (1914a) it is not great, being in the neighborhood of 300 meters. Knowledge of the biology of phlebotomus lhas proved quite illuminating concerning certain peculiarities in the distribution and transmission of Carrion's disease. Thus it had been generally accepted that Carrion's dis- ease was contracted chiefly, if not exclusively, at night. This was based on observations that nocturnal residence in the bartonella zone was often elicited in the case his- tories of patients, somtimes for as brief a period as a single night; whereas exclusive daytime residence was not attended with the same risk. An explanation of this observation was forthcoming when Shannon ob- served that phlebotomi were active only at night. Ac- cording to Shannon (1929), this periodic activitv is very marked. The insects do not stir from their shel- ters until after twilight when real darkness has ap- proached, and they return before early morning. It was indeed this correlation between nocturnal trans- mission and nocturnal activity of phlebotomus which, since other blood-suckers were very rarely caught at night, was the most helpful clue to the true vector of the disease (Townsend, 1913c). Another feature of the disease is its peculiar dis- tribution according to altitude. The endemic foci are bounded by upper and lower limits, often quite sharply defined, beyond which the disease is not contracted or transmitted. This is the case in the Rimac Valley. Shannon collected extensively three, and took phlebot- omi only within the endemic zone of bartonellosis. The cause of this limitation was, Shannon believed, to be found in the unfavorable physical conditions else- where. At lower altitudes the country has a slight annual rainfall and is quite arid, while above the limit of the zone, at about 8,000 feet, the night temperatures (500 F. or less) are lower than that considered mini- mal for normal activities (550 F.). The boundaries of the zone are subject to some fluctuation and may extend at certain times to include towns habitually out- side the endemic area. Such extensions appear to be often correlated with unusually heavy rainfalls, to fol- low overflows of rivers, etc., so that in such areas, at least, lack of sufficient humidity to support phlebotomus seems to be the limiting factor. Thus aridity seems to be very important, but other factors of importance must also be operative, for moun- tain streams pass through the zone, then continue a</page><page sequence="102">342 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY downhill course. It is evident that in the immediate vicinity of these rivers there is no considerable degree of aridity, yet below 2,000 feet in the Rimac Valley phlebotomi apparently do not occur. Why this should be so is not apparent. Low altitude in itself does not inhibit them, for they have been bred experimentally in Lima at about 500 feet above sea-level. Possibly at lower altitudes the fertile region surrounding the stream, being more narrow, is more thoroughly cul- tivated, rendering conditions for the sandflies less favorable through destruction of shelters, etc. What- ever the explanation, it seems important to determine what these very effective limiting factors may be in view of their possible conscious utilization elsewhere. Lack of spread from patients hospitalized outside of the bartonella zone, a fact which has long been noted, may now be more clearly understood. Spread through human contact is rare, and transmission by phlebotomus is the only variety of importance. Consequently in the absence of the vector, diffusion of the infection does not take place. A Access of phlebotoinus to man.-In the endemic areas of Peru which the author has visited, this is readily as- sured by the simple type of construction employed. The homes are in no sense of the word insect-proof. Consequently, since P. verrucarum enters buildings freely and is active at night, these buildings afford little or no protection to their inmates. Indeed, it is prob- ably within such sleeping quarters that transmission usually occurs. Conversely, when the vector does not have access to man, transmission has been prevented. Shannon's experience in this connection is illuminating. He lived and slept for several months in a highly endemic area, employing adequate protection against phlebotomi only at night, and did not contract the disease (see also p. 343).6 In Colombia, other sandflies are involved. Seven species have been described, none of which are those found in the Peruvian verruga zone. It is not yet determined which of these are responsible for bar- tonella transmission. Two of the Colombian species are known to attack man and to have a much wider distribution than is at present known for bartonellosis. Certain of the residents, those engaged in the manu- facture of Panama hats, are exposed to phlebotomus bites even during daylight hours, according to Osorno (1939). This arises less from any peculiarity of the insect than from the custom of following this occupa- tion in quarters which are dark, humid, and free from air currents. Such quarters do serve as sandfly shel- ters, phlebotomi have been taken there, and the condi- tions are favorable to daytime activity. Finally, there is still much that is unknown concern- ing the entomological aspect of Carrion's disease. The behavior of Bartonella bacilliformlis in the insect, and 6 Sleeping fully clothed with only the face protected is in- sufficient, for the sandflies crawl under bedding, up sleeves and trousers, etc. (Hertig, 1942b). the possibility of hereditary transmission in phlebot- omus, are unsolved problems. In many areas, as in Ecuador, the vector is unknown. Even in those re- gions where the vector has been established, the com- plete life history of the insect, as it takes place under natural circumstances, has not been determined. It is of the utmost importance that these points be elucidated. For, since we are not now able to eradicate the infection in man, control of the disease is at present limited to anti-phlebotomus measures. Yet the means of control now available are so cumbersome and costly that their employment on a large scale is not likely. There is acute need for simple measures, easy of ex- ecution, which will affect the sandfly adversely. The key to the problem lies in discovery of a more ad- vantageous method of atack on the vector, and for this purpose further entomological contributions are essen- tial. BAR TONELLA BACILLIFORMIS This organism exists in nature in man and in at least one species of phlebotomus. In relation to these two hosts, information concerning the organism has already been given. The length of survival in man may be long, in some cases apparently extending over a period of years. The sandfly has an opportunity to become in- fected not only during the disease but also in the period of asymptomatic infection which may either follow or precede any manifestation of illness. No natural ani- mal reservoirs are yet known,7 although experimentally certain animals have been infected (pp. 259-260 and 266-267). Whether phlebotomus may serve as a reser- voir by transmission of bartonella through the egg, is not determined. Other facts concerning the biology of Bartonella bacilliforinis have been presented in chapter I, to which the reader is referred for more details. CAUSES OF EPIDEMICS AND ENDEMICITY Epidemics have arisen in different ways, but all ap- pear to have one important feature in common: the infection of a previously non-exposed population. This may occur in two manners. In Peru, the epidemic of 1870 followed the importation of a large number of workers into an endemic area. This was followed by an increase in the number of cases with many fatalities, but without any obvious geographical extension of the disease; it therefore constituted an "internal epidemic." In Colombia, the converse apparently took place. The disease appeared in a region where it was previ- ously unreported, and progressed, causing an epidemic in new territory. In this region numerous phlebotomi are established and constitute the presumptive vector or vectors. None of these sandflies are the Peruvian vec- tors. and conversely none of the latter have been re- 7Very recently Hertig (1942b) reported isolation of bar- tonella from a field mouse.</page><page sequence="103">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 343 ported in Colombia. It seems probable, therefore, that this epidemic followed the introduction of Bartonella bacilliformis into a region where suitable vectors pre- existed. The epidemics persist for one or several years, giving a mortality of 40 percent or more, then diminish in in- tensity, and after the death of the most susceptible and a certain immunity in the-recovered cases, the disease persists in its endemic form. This persistence seems explicable by the facts that the vector has never been eradicated from the endemic foci and that a constant source of infection to the sandfly is available in the human carriers. SUMMARY Our knowledge of the epidemiology may be sum- marized as follows: The disease is transmitted to man in almost all instances by the insect vector; direct man- to-man transmission is not an important factor. The vector, where determined, has always been a species of phlebotomus. The insects become infected by feeding on the human population, either on patients, or on carriers, and pass the infection during subsequent hu- man refeedings. Facile access to human being is af- forded by the type of construction employed in the endemic areas. The peculiarities in the distribution of bartonellosis are dependent on the biology of phlebo- tomus rather than on that of Bartonella bacilliformis or variations in the 'human host. METHODS OF PROTECTION AND CONTROL The bases of action taken against human bartonello- sis are founded on the following observations: (a) the only important means of transmission to man is through the bite of a phlebotomus; and (b) there is now no known therapy which will eradicate bartonella infection in man. Accordingly, we conclude that, at present, effort may be most profitably devoted to prophylaxis; i. e., it may be directed against phlebotomi. Two types of measures are possible: (1) those designed to elimi- nate contact between man and phlebotomus; and (2) those intended to reduce the numbers of these insects. MEASURES DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE CONTACT BETWEEN MAN AND PHLEBOTOMUS Efficient execution of procedures of this type demand adequate knowledge of the habits of the responsible phlebotomi, which at present is available only for cer- tain localities. In the Rimac Valley of Peru, phlebot- omi are active only at night; consequently, screening measures, etc., are not essential, if it is possible to leave the region before darkness. This is perhaps the sim- plest method of protection, and has been used with great success lately on the occasion of the rebuilding of the "Verrugas" railroad bridge (Puente Carrion) over the Rimac River. All the working-men were removed by a train which left the bridge site before dusk and was outside of the endemic region before nightfall. The cases of the disease were said to be negligible (Hertig, 1942b). This is a very marked contrast to results in constructions in the same region before such measures were instituted. The choice of an evacuation site is most important; it is essential not to send infected individuals into regions where phlebotomi occur, since this would risk estab- lishing the disease in entirely new areas. Recognition of carriers is not possible by clinical means but requires blood cultures, and such a method applied to large num- bers would be inconsistent with the rapidity of action considered desirable. Fortunately, it seems unneces- sary, in undertaking any mass transportation of people of the endemic regions, to attempt to distinguish between the infected and the non-infected, and quite safe to move them to some area where the vector does not occur. Here again, our lack of entomological informa- tion proves a handicap, for it is altogether probable that nothing at all will be known concerning the prevalence of phlebotomus at the proposed evacuation sites. Should this situation arise, perhaps the most reliable guide would be to choose a site at a high altitude (e. g. above 8,000 feet) where the night temperatures are low. The Peruvian species were not found when the night temperatures were below 550 F. Other species may prove to be more hardy, so that minimal temperatures even lower than this would afford more assurance. Should phlebotomi be found to be active during the day, as is apparently the case in Colombia, nightly depart- ures alone could not be expected to afford complete protection. Evacuation every night of all persons in the endemic zone is not usually a practical procedure, and probably can be utilized only on a small scale. Permanent mass emigration would very likely prove to be impracticable, being both unpopular and even more costly than other methods to be described. From the preceding con- siderations, it seems that a method of the most general applicability would require phlebotomus protection of the residents permanently inhabiting the endemic areas. A considerable degree of prophylaxis has been af- forded in Peru by the simple expedient of inhabiting only phlebotomus-proof buildings after dusk. How- ever, the present dwellings of the residents would re- quire a considerable degree of modification before they were suitable. From the author's observations in Peru, screening of windows alone would be inadequate, for the simple type of construction now employed would permit ready passage of phlebotomus through the walls and the roofs of the dwellings. Whatever the type of building found most suitable in the regions affected, it is essential that the walls and roofs be tight, that the windows and doors be screened, important that there is no shelter for phlebotomus under the floors, in cellars, etc., and advisable that the interior flooring be kept smooth, solid, and clean in order to prevent breeding within the houses. The success of such measures in -indicated by the experience of Shannon (1929). This</page><page sequence="104">344 TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY author resided for months in a highly endemic barton- ella region without contracting the disease. He took the precaution, however, of sleeping at night in a screened, well-constructed dwelling, and under a fine- meshed mosquito bar. The fine netting was apparently not essential, for, although phlebotomi are smaller than mosquitoes, screens of the ordinary mesh count were effective in excluding the Peruvian species of sandflies. Hertig (1942b), however, finds that they easily pass ordinary screening with 14 to 18 squares to the inch, but not when the mesh count is 25 to 30. In the usual screening which has come to the author's hand, the internal length of the squares is slightly less than 2 mm., with 14 squares in 3 cm. According to the experience obtained elsewhere in projects of this nature, an educational campaign to acquaint the population with the rationale of the pro- jected measures will be needed if the fullest measure of co-operation is to be obtained. It will not be enough to provide suitable dwellings; they must be kept in an adequate state of repair. A wide-scale building project of this sort would re- quire, no matter how economically managed, a con- siderable expenditure. Since many of the residents of the endemic zone are among the least solvent members of the population, they probably could not afford the expense of rebuilding their homes. Consequently, some measure of financial aid will probably have to be provided. The use of repellents and insecticides may prove useful in certain circunmstances. Shannon (1929) ad- vised applying creosote to and around laborers' quar- ters. It has not been shown that this measure alone would completely exclude phlebotomi. For application to the body, Townsend (1915a) recommends the fol- lowing ointment: oils of anise, eucalyptus, and turpen- tine in equal parts, mixed in a boric acid ointment base; it is efficacious as long as the odor persists-a matter of several hours. Shannon (1929) found ci- tronella "very efficacious." The usual insecticide sprays may, from time to time, find their indication. MEASURES DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF PHLEBOTOMI Enterprises of this type would have a great ad- vantage over those above described in that, should their purpose be achieved, there is reason to anticipate that regions permanently cleared of phlebotomi would in the long run lose their endemic infection. At present our ignorance of the biology of phlebotomus, particu- larly the requirements of the immature stages, is a serious handicap to any such measures. Accordingly, those which have been suggested are directed against the adult sandflies. The mature phle- botomi are found in dark places, sheltered from air cur- rents; frequent hiding places are caves, pits, and similar irregularities in the land as well as constructions which afford the same type of shelter. Since phlebotomi'are not strong flyers (Townsend, 1915a) and dislike strong currents of air, they probably do not become very widely disseminated. Therefore, by destroying all spots suitable for the adults, a limited region might be made free from phlebotomus. Townsend estimates the flight range of P. verrucarum at 300 meters, and states (1915a): "Any given locality can be permanently freed from the Phlebotomus by removing all rock walls, stone piles or similar environment that can furnish diurnal shelter to the gnats. Caves or rock crevices must be sealed or filled with air-tight masonry or ce- ment. If no such place exists within a sufficient radius of a given point, that point will be free from the Phle- botomus at night and at all other times." This is a very positive statement, but so far as the present author is aware, no field trial of the method has been made. Placing of the land under cultivation has, elsewhere, and with forest species, resulted in a notable decrease of these insects (i. e., P. brumpti, in Brumpt, 1936b). Whether the same result would follow for those species involved in bartonellosis would, of course, have to be determined. This method would, however, merit a trial, for it has the inestimable advantage of being eco- nomically rewarding. Precautions would necessarily have to be taken; it would not do, for example, to ex- tend irrigation without assurance that the watered terri- tory was unsuitable for the insects, for we have seen that aridity appears to be one of the factors limiting their present distribution. Thus the water require- ments of the crop chosen might prove one factor de- termining success or failure of the venture. In summarizing the available measures of protection and control, it should be quite frankly realized that their present practicability varies considerably. So far as the individual is concerned, adequate prophylaxis has been achieved through simple measures of anti- phlebotomus protection. Such measures can also be applied on a large scale, but whether they will be ap- plied depends in the last analysis on the opinion of officials as to whether preservation of the health of the citizenry warrants such expenditures. There is an acute need for practical, efficient, low- cost measures of a permanent nature. Such do not yet exist. The possibility that they may be found de- pends on future research in all fields, although entomo- logical and therapeutic investigations are the most needed. CONCLUSIONS In terminating this chapter, it will not be without interest to attempt to apply our present knowledge con- cerning bartonellosis to a forecast of future possibilities. Considered for many years to be localized almost ex- clusively in Peru, the disease has, since 1935, been re- ported as new in Colombia. Even should it be sup- posed that bartonellosis has existed for some time in isolated foci in Colombia, the extent of the territory</page><page sequence="105">WEINMAN: ANEMIAS DUE TO BARTONELLA AND RELATED PARASITES 345 involved in the recent epidemic appears to indicate dis- semination of the infection. There is one point of particular interest which has developed from the investigation of this epidemic. None of the species of Peruvian sandflies has yet been taken in the collections made in Colombia-from which we may conclude that different species of phlebotomus are involved in the two countries, and that Bartonella bacilliformis is not strictly limited in its sandfly host. This datum further suggests that the spread took place by the introduction of Bartonella bacilliformis into a region where phlebotomi were already established rather than by the acclimatization of infected foreign sandflies. The common vector in Colombia will therefore in all probability not be the P. verrucarum of Peru. The question immediately arises as to the suitability of still other species of sandflies as vectors. Since species of these insects which feed on man are widely distributed throughout the world in tropical and temperate coun- tries, the question is not without its importance. Un- fortunately, to this author's knowledge, it has never been attacked experimentally. From our knowledge of the biology of B. bacilliformis, however, and by analogy with other insect-borne diseases caused by micro-or- ganisms, there is no reason to suppose that a number of species of phlebotomus would not prove to be suitable vectors. Certainly the data thus far obtained from Colombia support this view. In addition to suitable vectors, spread of Carrion's disease requires the introduction of Bartonella bacilli- formis. Dissemination by transportation of infected sandflies from one region to another may take place. But it will probably be found that the infection is more often introduced by the human carrier, for whom dif- ficulties of transportation and adaptation to a new en- vironment are usually infinitely less than for the sand- fly. Under ordinary circumstances there is probably no large-scale distant migration of the population from the bartonella zones, and consequently no large-scale exposure of sandflies of new regions to infection. This may perhaps explain why spread of the disease has not been more considerable. Exceptional circumstances, such as the expedition and quartering of infected troops in regions where phlebotomi abound, would pro- vide more suitable conditions, epidemiologically speak- ing, for massive exposure of the insects to infection and subsequent extension of the disease. Concerning the possibility of spread, there is then no reason for complacency. The factors which have limited the disease in the past appear to be those natural environmental circumstances which have limited the distribution of phlebotomi. Man has very rarely found it possible or expedient to affect the phlebotomi ad- versely, although it should be admitted frankly that he has not expended any considerable effort in this direc- tion. As a result of this attitude, it is probably true that human activities have, on the whole, probably tended toward extension of the disease, where exten- sion was possible, by the introduction of non-immunes into endemic areas, and of infected individuals into phlebotomus-infected zones. We have depended, it might be said, on nature to protect us, and nature is not obviously partial to the human species. Our present methods for combating bartonellosis are not altogether satisfactory. More effective means may be found, but this quite certainly will require attentive study of the various phases of the problem. In the past, bartonellosis has been relatively neglected; now we continue this neglect at the risk of finding ourselves some day facing a condition of increased importance without adequate means of opposition.</page><page sequence="106">INDEX Acarian(s), 297, 303 Acarids, 303 Acomys, 316 Actinomyces muris, 288 Actinomycetaceae, 273, 288 Aegyptianella, 273 Agoutis, 272 Anaplasma, 268, 273, 288, 320, 326, 327 ovis, 327, 328 Anaplasmidae, 273, 288 Anopheles, 276 Anteater, 319 Antelope, 327 Apes, 272 Apodemus agrarius, 318 sylvaticus, 315, 316 Argas, 276 Aristolochia tenera, 281 Arthropod(s), 273, 311, 328, 329, 341 Arthropoda, 275, 277, 302, 325 Arvicanthus striatus, 318 Arvicola arvalis, 319, 325, 330 Babesia, 326 gibsoni, 311 Babesiella berbera, 308 Bacillus, Eberth's 306 Gaertner's, 306 Bacillus typhosus, 301 Bacterium murium, 298 peruvianum, 265 Bartonella, 259, 273, 288, 289, 312, 320 biology, 269 cultivation, 270-272 definition, 246, 289 filtration, 270 inoculation of animals, 272 inoculation of man, 276 metabolism, 272 morphology, 268 motility, 270 pH, 271 physical and chemical agents, 270 protistology, 268 reproduction, 269 sources, 271 synonymy, 268 taxonomy, 272-273 viability, 270 virulence, 270 arvicolae, 312 bacilliformis, 243-251, 253, 261, 265, 268, 270-272, 275, 277, 280, 289, 296, 297, 299, 302, 308, 313-315, 317, 326, 340-343, 345; pl. 1 batrachorum, 319 bovis, 308 caviae, 314 cocoide, 268 'melloi, 319 muris, 290, 299 muris musculi var. albinoi, 316 nicollei, 319 pavlovskii, 319 peruviana, 268 pseudocebi, 319 ranarum, 319 rocha-limai, 319 sergenti, 308 ukrainica, 314 wenyoni, 308, 328 See also Haemobartonella Bartonellosis, human.
