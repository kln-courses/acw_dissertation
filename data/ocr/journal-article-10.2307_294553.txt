<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY the dense prosopography lie excursuses on the first division of Britain (pp. 168-72), its legionary garrison (pp. 219-22), and its government under the later empire (pp. 315-20): they fairly and concisely report ancient evidence and modern controversy, and the author is not afraid to admit uncertainty. In the preface, he admits his reluctant omission of an examination of the workings of patronage; it is left to the alert reader to pick out individual examples, some of them the author's most felicitous hypotheses. Above all, the book is imbued with a spirit of merited pietas, dedicated to Anthony Birley's father Eric Birley, who has been so influential in our conceptions of Roman Britain and the Roman army, and based in part on initial labours by the elder Birley. Father and son can be proud of the result, which will not be replaced in the forseeable future. EDWARD CHAMPLIN PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LUCIANA AIGNER FORESTI. Der Ostalpenraum und Italien: Ihre Kulturellen Beziehungen im Spiegel der Anthropomorphen Kleinplastik aus Bronze des 7. Jh.s v. Chr. Universita Italiana per Stranieri, Perugia. Dissertazioni di etruscologia e antichita italiche pubblicate a cura dell' Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici 3. Leo S. Olschki Editore, Florence, 1980. Pp. xii + 125, pls. 26. This book on the representation of the human figure in the art of the Iron Age reflects trends and concerns of recent scholarship in European proto- history. First of all, it is the product of international collaboration. Suggested by Massimo Pallottino and carried out by an Italian scholar living in Austria, it was made possible by the work of Italian, German, Austrian, Hungarian, and Yugoslav scholars. Second, the geographical area: the importance of the archaeology of the Eastern Alpine region has been recognized and well studied in recent years as archaeologists have focused on its ancient cultural unity, often obscured by modern political boundaries. Also typical of recent trends is its organization, as a corpus of otherwise scattered material, a basis for the commentary, and a strumento di lavoro available for further study. The statuettes the author has collected represent the beginning of the regular use of the human figure in this Alpine area in the early Hallstatt period of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., preceding the rise of "situla art" that developed in the region during the course of the seventh century B.C. (O.-H. Frey, Entstehung der Situlenkunst, Berlin 1969). For the period with which the author is dealing no written documentation exists: only two or three centuries later do some peoples in the area adopt the alphabet. Because these bronze figurines, often neglected by scholars in the past, have usually been found in tombs, they teach us something of the spiritual beliefs as well as the material world and daily life-art, technical ability, dress, society, economy-of the people who made them and those who placed them in their tombs. The opening chapter sets out the premises, limits, and method. A succinct survey of nineteenth- and twentieth-century research on the subject benefits 312</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS from the author's experience in tracing ancient and modern ideas on the origins of the Etruscans (Tesi ipotesi e considerazioni sull'origine degli Etruschi, Vienna 1974). She notes that the area of situla art was included in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and that a pre-World War I national pride formed the background for controversy over the chronological and cultural priority of Etruscan as against middle or north European influence. Theoretical discussion gave way in the 1950s to publication of previously excavated material, including the graves from Hallstatt, which constitute the starting point for any study of the East Alpine area. An important exhibit of situla art and its accompanying catalogue in 1961 once more focused scholarly interest and led to a measure of agreement on this unified though complex cultural phenomenon. Relations between Italy and the north in the period immediately preceding this art, in the early Hallstatt period, had not yet, however, been the object of a study, perhaps because of the reaction against the tendency of some past scholarship (referred to as the "Italic fascination" by Merhart) to attribute every change in the north to the influence of the "higher" culture of the south. The present study thus fills a long-felt need. The first chapter consists of a catalogue of twelve anthropomorphic bronze statuettes or groups from Austria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary and a discussion of their interpretation and of the development of small-scale sculpture in the Hallstatt period. There follows a catalogue of twenty-six figurines or groups from Italy (seven from north Italy and Picenum, fifteen from the Etruscan and Faliscan areas, four from south Italy and Sicily) and then comes a section on their interpretation. The figurines, all from the eighth and seventh cen- turies B.C., are listed in geographical and chronological order, with bibliography, technical, iconographical, and stylistic descriptions, and discussions of their dating, which is whenever possible based on tomb context. A third chapter deals with religious, artistic, and social relationships between the East Alpine region and Italy in this period as reflected in the bronze figurines, while the fourth, on the origin of small-scale sculpture in the Hallstatt period, examines changing patterns of culture, influence, and relationships in the area. Conclu- sions are outlined and summarized in an eleven-page Italian resume. Docu- mentation consists of over 250 footnotes and up-to-date bibliography, with several titles still "forthcoming." Photographs of each item and of comparative material are generally of good quality and well reproduced; occasionally one would like to see a detail of these tiny figures more clearly. English readers will find J. V. S. Megaw, Art of the European Iron Age: A Study of the Elusive Image (New York 1970) (not quoted by Aigner Foresti) handy for illustrations, bibliography, and discussion of many figurines; and much Italian material is now included in the seven volumes of Popoli e civilta dell'Italia antica, Rome 1974-78, which the author was able to use. The author's analysis shows that the representation of human figures in the Hallstatt period developed as a result of changes in this area during the eighth century B.C. The outcome of such changes is for the moment clearer than their cause. Clearly, they paralleled but were different from those which took place in Greece and Italy; and the process which led to the representation of the human figure in art never led, as it did in Italy, to literacy and to the forming of cities, the other two great contributions of Greek culture. The mixture of earlier local traditions and later innovations apparent in these 313</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY northern statuettes is similar to that observed in the relief decoration of situla art (under the influence of Orientalizing Greek art, both directly and through the Etruscans, situla art gradually takes the place of this small figurative sculp- ture). What we see is a creative local reinterpretation of motifs used to express native beliefs and customs in a style which combines realistic details and sche- matic forms, often giving these tiny figures an impressive force. Neither absolute dependence on the art and culture of Italy, as was once thought, nor complete independence, as some claimed, accounts for the appearance of this sculpture. Bronze figures from Italy, though relying on much the same limited repertoire as those from the north-a fact that tends to give false emphasis to similarities in fact superficial-exhibit important differences. In Italy a prefer- ence for sculptural form marks a style which often includes a direct Oriental as well as a primitive and a geometric component, the latter reinforced by the influence of Greek Geometric art. (To G. M. A. Hanfmann, Altetruskische Plastik, 1936, and E. H. Richardson, The Recurrent Geometric in the Sculpture of Central Italy, 1962, should now be added O. J. Brendel's chapters, "The Villanovan Style" and "The Rise of Statuary " in his Etruscan Art, 1978, and Richardson's recent Early Etruscan Bronzes.) A short review cannot do justice to considerations of social, religious, and economic order which arise from the examination of these statuettes. Made as symbols of status for an elite, whose beliefs in an afterlife they express, in a style that reflects the taste of the common people and of local craftsmen, they often come from tombs that help us reconstruct their owners' lives. Rich burials, some containing chariots, prove that, in both areas, women participated in the wealth and prestige of the men. In the north wealth seems to have come from cattle-raising, metal-working, and trade in amber and glass paste. In Italy those buried with the statuettes were often warriors; figures from votive deposits also reveal to us something about the relationship of these people with their gods. In the struggle to understand the original meaning of these figures, their poses, attributes, dress or nakedness, groupings and context, iconographic problems are basic. The northern figures are almost always naked; it is hard to determine the significance of this nakedness. (One wonders whether figures here described as nonphallic or even "sexless" or "androgynous" are actually to be thought of as wearing some kind of garment.) The symbolism of axes, wagons, tripods, horses, and riders must have something to do with their function in funerary ritual and procession. The groups of figures on the Strettweg wagon seem to show such a ritual in action, though individual figures are not easy to identify. Is the thin, tall, naked belted image of a woman supporting a vessel (20-21) a goddess, as several scholars believed, or the goddess' servant, as the author suggests? Are the two "sexless" figures with a spread- antlered deer (21-22) servants? The carefully wrought little horse and rider also reflect the Strettweg wagon's basic function and its owner's faith in a higher being whom one could approach by means of cult, processions, and other rituals. Female "water carriers" balancing vessels on their heads seem to denote some kind of purification ritual. Male figures-one a warrior-with exaggerated phalloi, related to funerary ritual, apparently served in an apotropaic capacity. The representation of pairs of men and women together (three couples are included in the group) also probably were meant to symbolize the triumph of life over death. 314</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS Bronzes from Italy, like those from the north, represent female water carriers, warriors, phallic males, and figures of "Venus pudica," touching her sex, riders and ploughmen leading their oxen. Terra-cotta figures in hut urns from Etruria and Latium are usefully considered as comparisons: These may have been meant to represent the deceased, like some of the bronzes. (For the world reflected by these urns, see F. Brown, "Of Huts and Houses," In Memo- riam Otto J. Brendel [Mainz 1976] 5-12.) Two couples present problems as well as interesting features. On one from Vetulonia, man and woman are tied together by a chain issuing from the woman's head. On another-two charming figures from Sicily, standing arm-in-arm and smiling-the female is taller than the male. Does her size necessarily imply that she is a goddess protecting the man, as many scholars hold? The author feels they are more likely to be mortals than, as so often in Greece, a divine couple. Later, Etruscan bronze statuettes of couples also show the woman as taller than the man (e.g., Louvre, Br 296). So do Etruscan mirrors, on which craftsmen were fond of representing mothers and sons like Thetis and Achilles or Eos and Memnon, as well as "older women" with their young lovers, like Venus (Turan) and Adonis. (See Hand- book of Etruscan Mirrors, edited by N. de Grummond, forthcoming. For the representation of other couples in later Etruscan art, see my article in Reflections of Women in Antiquity, edited by H. Foley [1981] 324-41.) Judgments must be made about each figure's meaning: the deceased or an ancestor, divine or mortal, master or slave, myth, ritual, magic or religion? The importance of the subject and of the author's investigation goes beyond her stated scope, a study of the relationship between the north and the south of the Eastern Alpine area in this crucial period of the development of civilization in Europe; for, like any good original research, her analysis teaches us to look and to question basic premises. The human figure allows people who do not yet write to represent scenes of ritual and daily life that show not only their material culture but their beliefs about life, death, gods, and magic. Because the subject is the emotional impact of the human figure and its use in art to represent complex ideas and beliefs in the absence of a literature which can guide us, the book in a real sense uses archaeology to enlarge the limits of what we call history.
