<plain_text><page sequence="1">Coyote, Contingency, and Community: Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster Carlton Smith [T]rickster stories point to the way ordinary, conventional reality is an illusory construction produced out of a particular univocal interpreta- tion of phenomena appearing as signs. This deeper wisdom about the linguisticality of our constructed world and the illusoriness of that construction is where trickster stories open onto the sacred. -Anne Doueihi, "Inhabiting the Space Between Discourse and Story in Trickster Narratives," in Mythical Trickster Figures: Contours, Contexts and Criticisms Among the numerous chimerical developments to occur in Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water (1993), perhaps the most telling occurs as the four old Indians at the center of the novel alter the outcome of the allegedly famous John Wayne western The Mysterious Warrior.' Having traipsed from a Florida hospital to the Blackfoot reserve in Canada, the four-hundred-year-old Indians have set out in an effort to "change the world." Reckoning that the "classic" movie is as good a place as any to start, the old ones stealthily alter the "well- known" final scene of the movie as it unfolds amid the immense video wall of Wild Bill Bursum's Home Entertainment Center. While the assembled watch, John Wayne and his costar, Richard Widmark, suffer a cinematic death usually reserved for Indians. Seemingly cornered and vanquished amid the stark expanse of Monument Valley, the Indians who had been pursued by the Cavalry for the entire movie "began to shoot back, and soldiers began falling over: Sometimes two or three soldiers would drop at once, clutching their chests or their stomachs.... John Wayne looked down and stared stupidly at the arrow in his thigh, shaking his head in amazement and disbelief as two bullets ripped through his chest and out the back of his jacket. Richard Widmark collapsed face down in the sand, his hands clutching at an arrow buried in his throat.2 Carlton Smith is an assistant professor at Palomar College in California and teaches English at the Pauma Valley Reservation Instructional Center.

Coyote's "Yahoo!" signals the subversive reversal of the culturally resonant image of John Wayne felling Indians. New stories emerge in the process; old stories change. In a similar way, Coyote and the four old ones mischievously subvert and entangle a variety of other stories in Green Grass - stories ultimately bound up in the cultural processes of significa- tion and representation itself. From this perspective, King's Coyote can be viewed as intervening in the semiotic realm - a realm where cultural signifiers and politicized discursive structures produce meaning and coherent stories. Coyote thus exemplifies a "semiotic trickster," a version of what Gerald Vizenor has termed a "comic holotrope." As a comically disruptive sign, Coyote forces us to consider how interpretations and "readings" of the world are ceaselessly influenced by issues related to colonial representation and power, and how meaning and significance can mutate when conventional categories of perception shift. Such a liberative lesson ultimately serves to help heal King's protagonist Lionel, as well as other members of his contemporary Blackfoot community, allowing them to see new life possibilities. A "semiotic trickster," Vizenor emphasizes, "is a healer and comic liberator; ... not an artifact or real victim in oral summaries, . . . [but] a communal sign in imagination ... that endures in modern [Native American] literature."4 It is precisely this "semiotic trickster" - a disjunctive, disruptive and poten- tially radically subversive trickster - that runs through King's Green Grass and influences its slippery narrative strategies with themes of resistance and liberation. Correspondingly, King's Coyote emerges not so much as a representative of anthropomorphic, embodied versions of trickster, but rather as a linguistic construct sent forth to disrupt our acceptance of certain "old stories" - stories that collude in the oppression of Native Americans. King's postmodern Coyote as such elucidates important contemporary interpretations of orality itself, as well as current post-structuralist discussions of culture, history, and anthropology. As James Clifford reminds us, "even the simplest cultural accounts are intentional creations."5 In turn, we - as readers - when confronting King's beguiling narrative are collectively redefined and transfigured into alternative communities made aware of the political nature of representation and all "cultural accounts." Rather than entering into word games, or even into communities structured by shared interpretation, we are absorbed into a narrative play wherein the oral moment of the story necessarily displaces any "fixed" interpretive structure.' We decode narrative and apprehend meaning in other ways; through this acquired 516 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="3">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster apprehension our relationships with others and with the text shift. Older hierar- chies and simplistic understandings fracture, providing not only other ways to read but - through these readings - new ways of seeing the world. Until recently, the image of Native American tricksters as embodied beings has been a persistent fantasy within the social imaginary of the West. Indeed, traditional religious and anthropological interpretations of trickster have tended to construct trickster as a comic figure who assumes human or animal poses. Paul Radin's seminal study of Winnebago trickster cycles, for example, presents trickster as an individual neither "human being [n]or god, but something of both."7 As an embodied isolate, Radin's trickster functions within traditional stories at the level of character, and in turn his operations may be regarded as metaphorical. Recently William Bright has described trickster as a mythic figure, who, though a giver of fire, was also a "gross lecher and inevitable thief, liar, outlaw, a prankster whose schemes regularly backfire."' In emphasizing the human aspects of such figures as Old Man Coyote, Bright asserts that in "the Native American context, [tricksters] are not animals; they are first people, ... members of a race of mythic prototypes who live before humans existed.... They had tremendous powers ... and were also capable of being brave or cowardly, conservative or innovative, wise or stupid."' Such anthropomorphic descriptions have invariably led to a kind of typology, founded on seeing trickster as a mythical being; trickster is thus a figure whose disparate and complex identity escapes bianarism and is simultaneously associated with truth and falsehood, transgression and conservatism, generosity and theft, wisdom and foolishness, as well as lechery and innocence. Recent critical commentaries informed by a post-structuralist vocabulary, however, have begun to assail this anthropomorphic version of trickster, viewing it in part as emblematic of a Western humanistic desire to embody trickster in a humanizing rhetoric of presence. Perhaps most vocal in this regard has been Gerald Vizenor, who reads such constructions of tricksters as illustrative of the "monologic" quality of Western anthropology, and its persistent desire to construct "Indian" within limited parameters. For Vizenor, humanistic anthro- pomorphic versions of trickster - as fully embodied - erode what he argues is the tropic, semiotic function of trickster. In his own trickster tales Vizenor vigorously resists notions of a mythic trickster - a trickster who transcends language - firmly rooting his tricksters within entanglements of discourse. Con- currently, Vizenor finds a resonant vocabulary for describing the semiotic work- ings of trickster within the terms of post-structuralist thought and discourse. Asserting that "semiotic theories reveal more about trickster narratives (the texture of language and structure of sentences) than do theories of social science," Vizenor argues that trickster as "comic holotrope" - as a nexus of signs enjoining the speaker/writer with interpretive community - functions at the level of language and representation: American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 517</page><page sequence="4">Carlton Smith Tropes are figures of speech; here the trickster is a sign that becomes a comic holotrope, a consonance of sentences in various voices, ironies, variations in cultural myths and social metaphors. Comic holotropes comprise signifiers, the signified, and signs, which in new critical theories provided a discourse on the trickster in oral narratives, translations and modern imaginative literature.1o Indeed, Vizenor's own postmodern trickster tales, like King's Green Grass, represent highly imaginative efforts to remake and re-inscribe the sacred trickster within the postmodern context. Vizenor's Darkness in St. Louis Bearheart, with its multivalent levels of narrative, comic playfulness, deconstructive thrusts, and overall critique of Western notions of stable truths, might very well be considered the archetypal trickster narrative of modern imaginative literature. Trickster's influence in Bearheart, as in Vizenor's later stories and novels such as Griever: An American Monkey King in China, Trickster of Liberty, and Heirs of Columbus, forces readers to listen to trickster, to challenge their preconceptions regarding Western notions of "history," "reality," and the "sacred."" As Alan Velie notes, Vizenor accomplishes this through his own "trick," getting readers to see the world through trickster eyes. "Vizenor writes like a trickster," states Velie, "creating a narrator who is a professed trickster, telling a story of tricksters, all with the purpose of turning the audience into tricksters."'2 While such postmodern permutations of trickster may seem to detract from the figure's inherent sacredness, such constructions ironically offer a significant lesson in spiritual growth founded on new ways of seeing. Echoing Vizenor's desire to re-inscribe trickster within the semiotic realm, Anne Doueihi argues that traditional Western religious and anthropological interpretations that depict a transcendent trickster have to do with a Western preoccupation with origins. Trickster is sacred, the logic of this narrative proceeds, and thus must be understood as an embodied figure whose origins exist beyond history. Thus by over looking the complicated semiotic features of trickster stories, and by "taking narrative and meaning reverentially - as story and signified" - traditional scholar- ship has constructed a "parallel conception of trickster stories as themselves meaningful in that (and only that) they figure in the great story of human civilization, in the great story which is the history of religion."13 As such these constructions legitimize notions of universality and hierarchy, placing the trick- ster within some larger Western narrative of an embodied, monotheistic form of spirituality. By contrast, a post-structuralist interpretative paradigm allows Doueihi to view trickster stories as discursive constructs that "play" in the space between "discourse" and "story," between narrative structure and the act of telling a story. From this perspective "story" is defined as "a sequence of actions or events, independent of their manifestation in discourse"; and "discourse" is "the discursive presentation of narration of events.""4 By over-emphasizing the 518 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="5">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster referential aspects of the "story" within trickster narratives, many interpreters often overlook the way the story's position within a complicated discursive web detracts from any fixed or transparent meaning. Such readings invariably lead to readings of trickster stories as mediums for referential, "univocal" interpreta- tions of reality. But by focusing on the semiotic structure of trickster stories, and how such a structure "performs" on the listener/reader of trickster narratives, we can begin to understand how such transparent, overly referential meanings unravel. Read from this vantage, trickster narratives undermine stable meanings and hold up such positivistic groundings as suspect, untrustworthy, and comically foolish. Thus, "instead of having one meaning, the text opens onto a plurality of meanings, none of which is exclusively 'correct,' because as the narrative develops in the trickster stories, the conventional level of meaning ceases to be appropriate."'5 For Douiehi, this semiotic lesson of trickster tales has liberatory power: It is the power of signification, the possibility to mean, that the trickster celebrates.... [I]n the trickster's world, everything is already a sign of something. It is a sign because it is part of a sacred world; it is a sign of the sacred. The universe is essentially linguistic and ultimately, infinitely interpretable. The trickster is thus not a sacred being, but the way the whole universe may become meaningful, sacred, and filled with "power."'' In Green Grass, Running Water it is just such a liberative journey, aided by Coyote, that the story both "performs" and thematizes in its depiction of a community of contemporary Blackfoot who negotiate life on and off the reserve. Unlike King's first novel, Medicine River (1989), which deals with life on the Blackfoot Canadian reserve in a relatively straightforward and seemingly linear way, Green Grass as a postmodern trickster narrative shrouds its story with a dense discursive web that undermines any stable interpretive platform.17 Adopting a form of what Vizenor has called "mythic verism," Green Grass delights in interspersing the "fantastic" and implausible, with the all-too-real. Multistoried, multivoiced, playfully postmodern, Green Grass presents mutually informing stories that merge myth, history, tribal folklore, biblical scripture, and myriad tribal and dominant culture referents, all of which circulate like running water within the shifting frame of King's trickster story. Amid this polyvocality, two basic stories unfold - one magical, one "realis- tic." The "realistic" story has to do with Lionel and the daily lives of his Blackfoot friends and family as they head toward convergence at an annual Sun Dance on the Blackfoot reserve in Canada.'" This central story concerns the individual struggles of Lionel's "academic" uncle Eli, Lionel's feminist/teacher girlfriend Alberta, and Charlie Looking Bear, a lawyer. All except Lionel have left the reserve to seek lives on the "outside," and the Sun Dance marks a American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 519</page><page sequence="6">Carlton Smith communal coming home. For Eli in particular, who has left academia, the Sun Dance emerges as a celebration of the traditional past, which leads to his occupation of an old family house, one that is being threatened by the building of a dam on Indian land. Ultimately it is Eli's influence - aided by Coyote - that causes Lionel to reconsider the value of stories and community elemental to Native tradition. The magical segments concern trickster Coyote, various "creation" stories, and the four old Indians who have left a Florida hospital to save Lionel. Like trickster Coyote, the four old Indians move back and forth between levels of narrative, playfully influencing the realistic aspects of the story. Eventually these levels of narrative merge, constructing the novel's complex and playful "mythic verism." At the intersection of these levels of narrative, several textual conversations emerge. Although these dialogues are necessarily intertwined, identity, ethnicity, culture, and history develop as significant topics. Appropriately, in the space between these conversations stands King's trickster Coyote, whose movement across a range of conceptual borders problematizes ontological and epistemologi- cal interpretations of the world."9 Levels of narrative ceaselessly contaminate one another, stories ceaselessly modify each other, and readers must constantly "invent" the text to suspend final interpretation within the indeterminate space of the interconnecting stories. In this way King's narrative compels readers to enter the complicated arena of trickster, to learn how language conditions reality and meaning among communal exchanges. This dialectical world-making is consistent with what Doueihi views as trickster's spiritual lesson: The trickster shows us a way to see the world by opening our minds to the spontaneous transformations of a reality that is always open and creative.... It is in the language out of which they are constructed that trickster stories make accessible the deeper wisdom about the nature of the world.20 Ultimately, it is this through rupturing of stable linguistic ground that Green Grass allows for the possibility of transformation, the acceptance of new stories and possibilities. From this perspective King's Green Grass theorizes itself, per- formatively "making readers into tricksters." It is "performative" in that it is an active text, a text that acts on the reader and requires new ways of seeing. This performativity ultimately lies at the center of King's story and is intricately tied to the novel's central lesson concerning Native American survival. That Green Grass will attempt to provide this important lesson in cultural survival and renewal is signaled early on when Alberta has a discussion with her class that alludes to the ancient Indians who will help Lionel come to a similar awareness. The old Indians' names are Crusoe, Hawkeye, Lone Ranger, and 520 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="7">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster Ishmael. Though mysterious at first, it is revealed soon that they are tribal representatives delivered to Florida at the end of the Indian Wars - Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche, and Arapaho. Having escaped to the road they are out to "change the world," though how that will happen is at first unclear. Like their sometime-companion Coyote, they too travel between the "realistic" and mythic spaces of King's narrative. In their playful exchanges with each other they incessantly tell their "own" stories of creation, each comically modifying events according to their individual traditions. During Alberta's history lesson it becomes evident that these Indians are somehow associated with the wayward Indians who had "painted their stories" after having been driven off their traditional lands and forcibly relocated to a Florida detention center at Fort Marion. As Alberta, a Blackfoot who has left the reserve and become a teacher, explains to her students, In 1874, the U.S. army began a campaign of destruction aimed at forcing the southern Plains tribes into reservations. The army systemati- cally went from village to village burning houses, killing horses, and destroying food supplies. They pursued the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Coman- che, and the Arapaho relentlessly into one of the worst winters of the decade. Starvation and freezing conditions finally forced the tribes to surrender.21 Alberta goes on to show her class "Plains Indian Ledger Art," which, she explains, was drawn by some of the captive Indians and depicts such things as "the battles they had fought with the army and other tribes," "their life on the plains," and "life in prison.'"22 But when Alberta asks what the students might deduce from the drawings and is met with silence, she asks: "Do they tell us anything about the people who did them or the world in which they lived?" Encountering more silence, she tells the students that none of the Indians escaped - but implies that the drawings themselves, spiritual and transportive in nature, suggest a kind of spiritual escape. This history lesson, shrouded in mystery, becomes important because it represents a lesson in cultural expectation, interpretation, and reading. The "stories" drawn by the Indians cannot become intelligible to the students because they don't possess the cultural or conceptual vocabulary to understand them. Moreover, the spirituality of the Indians cannot be discovered in the paintings because the students lack the context from which they might recognize meaning. Only by understanding the "story" of Indian annihilation and erasure in America might the story of spiritual survival and fortitude be grasped. In this sense the students, like readers, need to break free from the hegemony of traditional "white" stories of the frontier, and begin to understand how history is a construct. Such wisdom could provide an interpretive space wherein ancient American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 521</page><page sequence="8">Carlton Smith Indians hitchhiking across the continent might become a possibility. Only through learning to (re)read the past can Alberta's students reconstruct Native American history and in doing so reconstruct the Native American community.23 Alberta's lesson has other implications as well, particularly when it comes to transcultural contact and the assessment of Indian cultures by non-Indians. Significantly, some of the students possess familiar "white" names, such as Elaine Goodale, John Collier, and Henry Dawes. King's reference to these famous "students" of Indian cultures alludes to the inevitable and disastrous result of objectifying Native American society, and in doing so presents readers with the impossibility of truly "knowing" another culture. As King's depiction of young Dawes suggests, "interpreting" cultures always implies a kind of cultural arro- gance that can only lead to "mis-readings." When Alberta asks Dawes his opinion of the drawings, Dawes responds that "they're kind of like stick figures. You know, like kids draw."24 Dawes's condescending response, predicated on cultural authority and ignorance, necessarily reveals a paternalistic arrogance that has profound implications when transformed into governmental policies such as the Dawes Act. The scene, resonant with the names and familiar but reductive readings of Indian experience, comments upon the inherent violence of such monologic "versions" of cultural meaning. Meaning and genuine com- prehension, instructs Alberta, are only possible when the fixed homogenetic cultural matrix is performatively disrupted. It is important to note that as a trickster "performance" the dialogic structure of Green Grass immediately foregrounds the linguistic and cultural processes that produce meaning and that have crucial relevance to Alberta's lesson in reading and interpreting history. Readers literally enter Green Grass through an ongoing conversational gambit. The novel begins by invoking the mythic space of origin stories in the oral tradition: So. IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS NOTHING. JUST THE WATER. Coyote was there, but Coyote was asleep. That coyote was asleep and that Coyote was dreaming. When Coyote dreams, anything can happen. I can tell you that.25 Following this, however, a number of demystifying gestures occur, undermining the clear spirituality of this mythic space and introducing parody. In particular this dialogic panel is followed by other similar panels in which the four old Indians muse about how to begin the story. The quartet tries various openings, sounding in their comic banter much like Beckettian fools: "ONCE UPON A TIME"; "A LONG TIME AGO IN A FAR AWAY LAND"; "MANY MOONCOMECHUKA.... Hahahahahahahahaha .. ."; "IN THE BEGIN- NING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND EARTH."26 522 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="9">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster These playful exchanges, which emphasize various conventional discursive strategies for staging stories, correspondingly point to Green Grass's staging of discursivity itself. Literary openings are attended by various codes, expectations, rules, logic(s), and their own ability to produce a conventional "sense of an ending." The old Indians ultimately try numerous variations, and in doing so comically unmask the contingencies associated with storytelling, reality, and expectation.27 Coyote shares this surfacing and resurfacing frame with the four old Indians. Here trickster Coyote quite literally occupies the space between discourse and story. Functioning as Vizenor's mischievous and disruptive "comic holotrope," Coyote confuses the "simple" story of Lionel's attainment of wisdom by con- stantly returning emphasis to Green Grass as a novel whose "moral" lesson will develop in part out of the text's trickster performance and beguiling structure. This decentering effect is again underscored in the curious conversation that opens the novel, and which precedes the "realistic" portion of the story concerned with Lionel's life. The exchange involves Coyote, Coyote's Dream, and "I": Who are you? says that dream. Are you someone important? "I'm Coyote," says Coyote. "And I am very smart." I am very smart, too, says that dream. I must be Coyote. "No," says Coyote. "You can't be a Coyote. But you can be a dog .... " But when that Coyote dream thinks about being a dog, it gets everything backwards.28 Like a recurrent lens that will be distorted differently with each successive glance, this opening establishes the slippery semiotic games recurrent throughout Green Grass. "I" here clearly refers to King, the creative trickster who is con- structing the narrative, but also to trickster as trope - as a signifier in narrative - as well as to a figure who speaks and seems embodied. "I" is also a character who is involved in the story, a construction like trickster. Similarly, in this backward story dog is transformed into GOD, a God who is a signifier that cannot transcend but who will nonetheless promise to become "sacred" in this story of renewal. Readers reading/interpreting through this disruptive lens, then, must con- stantly be aware that they are involved in construction of meaning rather than simply reading a linear or cohesive story. In this way the novel engages readers in an active collaboration that has resonance with Michail Bakhtin's notion of "heteroglossia," a concept that underscores the semiotic contingencies that condition all aspects of "telling" and representation. In Keeping Slug Woman Alive, Greg Sarris correspondingly engages Mikhail Bakhtin's notion of heterog- lossia to underscore and emphasize how Native Pomo oral traditions - in many ways similar to Lionel's Blackfoot traditions - reflect similar masking and unmasking features within their sacred story traditions.29 For Sarris, such oral traditions emphasize the contingency of meaning and reality by self-consciously American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 523</page><page sequence="10">Carlton Smith underscoring the idea that worldviews are storied constructs. Using his sister's voice to make the point, he writes that for Natives the "[t]hings you hear come back. A story for us Indians is like a cork in water. No matter where it goes, no matter how much you push, it floats back to the top."30 Sarris further asserts: For us, a story or teaching is never complete. . ... A story's meaning is dependent on the life beyond it.... Words and stories poison the healthy, heal the sick, empower lovers, transform the world.31 Bakhtin's commentary on the dialogic influences on the novel and language thus provides a resonant way for Sarris to discuss the complexity that informs oral culture and its emphasis on stories. Sarris concurs with Bakhtin, who notes that language is "heteroglot from top to bottom: it represents the coexistence of sociological contradictions between the present and the past, between the differing epochs of the past, between different socio-ideological groups in the present, between tendencies, schools, circles, and so forth, all given bodily form."32 Correspondingly, in conversations with his family friend Mabel, Sarris notes a similar polyvocality: Mabel provokes ... a specific dialogue, or conversation, that can open the intermingling of multiple voices within and between people they encounter, enabling people to see and hear the way voices intersect and overlap, the ways that they have been repressed or held down because of certain social and political circumstances and the ways they can be talked about and usurped.33 Thus, as Sarris's works elucidate, many Native oral traditions of which trickster is a part are fundamentally self-conscious about the way stories circulate within communities, the manner in which such tales gain meaning and are thus always contingent. Similarly, Brian McHale in Postmodern Fiction invokes Bakhtin's model to discuss the way postmodern narratives foreground polyvocality to emphasize the political and ideological factors involved in the production of "worlds."34 Emphasizing this point, McHale cites Bakhtin: Every language in the novel is a point of view, a socio-ideological conceptual system of real social groups and their embodied representa- tives. ... [A]ny point of view on the world fundamental to the novel, must be concrete, a socially embodied point of view, not an abstract purely semantic position .... [And] an actual social life and historical becoming create within an abstractly unitary national language a multi- 524 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="11">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster tude of concrete worlds, a multitude of verbal-ideological and social belief systems.35 For McHale, postmodern texts thus foreground the production of meaning, of "worlds." As he writes, "by heightening the polyphonic structure and sharpening the dialogue in various ways," postmodern fiction "foregrounds the ontological dimension for the confrontation among discourses, the achieving of a polyphony of worlds."36 In provocative ways, King's Green Grass as trickster narrative marks the intersection between McHale's postmodernism and Sarris's Native oral tradi- tions. Green Grass's performative strategies thus reveal and reverse - while collaborating with the reader in its dialogic structure - the "poisoning" power of words and stories. This critique is comically evident in Green Grass's numerous playful references to words and names that refract their traditional placements within "white" narratives. Most obvious is the use of the names Ishmael, Defoe, Hawkeye, and The Lone Ranger. Here these names refer to Indians - not the "white" halves of what Leslie Fielder long ago described as the frontier couple. "Uncoupled" from works that produced and grounded their former signification/ identifications, the names playfully reveal the way the Other functions as an indelible component within discovery and frontier narratives, servicing the psy- cho-social construction of the Euro-American self.37 Similarly, numerous "histor- ical" names and referents are detached from their traditional contexts and float as signifiers throughout the text. Old names are fixed to new identities. In the "water world," the "realistic world," Henry Dawes is not a famous advocate of Indian Christianization and education but an inquisitive child. Mary Rowland- son refers not to the famous Puritan but to a schoolgirl. Camelot is not a mythical place but a "progressive" Indian hospital prone to "minor mistakes." Pocahantas is not a famous East Coast Indian but a modern stripper, "the sexiest squaw west of the Mississippi."38 Similarly, Adam, of Biblical fame, has been recast as Ahdamn and circulates within the mythic loop of creation stories that occur in the "skyworld." Here, too, Old Woman and grandmother Turtle, having slipped out of traditional space of Blackfoot stories, discuss microwave ovens and Ahdamm's penchant for naming everything in a "garden" that isn't really his in the first place. In a zany way King's unhinging and recasting of these names thus forces a "confrontation between discourses," which inevitably pushes us toward a recognition of how certain stories attain purchase within cultures. The traditional place for these names exists within a matrix of discursive fields that are subtended with power relations. Of course, within the hegemonic productions of such ideas as "the frontier" and "Indian," many of these traditional sites of signification are associated with the tyranny and oppressiveness of colonial representations and production of meaning. In Green Grass this critique quite obviously leads to American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 525</page><page sequence="12">Carlton Smith King's humorous play on the way we "read" our respective worlds and the cultural tensions that exist between forms of discursive production. As a semiotic border crosser, King's Coyote moves "betwixt and between" these discourses too, revealing how discourse and stories quite literally produce certain versions of such constructs as "reality" and "history." The lesson in reading/seeing that occurs throughout Green Grass is emblem- atic in the "who's on first" exchanges between the receptionist Babo - who is supposed to know about the old Indians - and the hapless detective Cereno, who has come to question Babo at the hospital. Babo and Cereno, of course, are familiar names from Herman Melville's famous trickster narrative, "Benito Cereno." Melville's Cereno is the victim of representation, caught between two "worlds." When Sergeant Cereno asks Babo about the escapees, she says, "Well, they were old." And when he presses further about their identity and background, she tells Cereno, "We used to talk, you know, life, kids, fixing the world.... We'd trade stories, too, the Indians and me. That's what I could do, you know, tell you one of the stories they told me."39 Of course, Cereno can no more understand the stories of ancient Indians who walk the earth than Alberta's students can understand the secret language of the Plains Ledger Art. Repeatedly and in similar ways the characters in Green Grass find themselves captives of their own conceptual vocabularies and stories. Bill Bursum can only relate to Indians as figures in John Wayne movies. Charlie Looking Bear's father is fired from working in movies because his nose "is too big for an Indian." Latisha, Lionel's sister, is beaten by her husband because she doesn't conform to the image of an "Indian" wife. Eli is haunted by the memory of border guards who confiscated his father's sacred head-dress, because to them it only represented a mass of "illegal" feathers. As in Melville's "Benito Cereno," all these readings of reality rely on culturally embedded perceptions - on grounding within in discursive fields. In Green Grass, as in Melville's story, water is the predominant metaphoric medium that signals worlds afloat. However, unlike Melville's Cereno, who knows that Babo's barber's knife at his throat can be "read" in painfully different ways, King's detective ultimately lacks the acquisition of such sacred knowledge. In Vizenor's words, he is doomed to his "terminal creeds," a form of epistemological production that disallows difference. He is simply unable to understand. More- over, his captivity within narratives is reflexive with Green Grass's larger interroga- tion of the way written "historical" narratives perpetuate the entrapment of Native cultures within the "static" historical representations of the past. This process is exposed in King's depiction of the "three" mistakes which threaten to keep Lionel working at Bill Bursum's Entertainment Center. In Lionel's case, his initial gloominess and feeling of alienation quite literally are precipitated by the unyielding narratives of his so-called past. The narrative that haunts Lionel began when he was a child, when he feigned tonsillitis thinking he would get to stay home from the reserve school. But his plan goes 526 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="13">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster awry and he only narrowly averts a heart operation after a nurse confuses his identity. Long after the mishap, though, people assume Lionel "has a heart problem," and this assumption proves disruptive. Similarly, years later while a student in college he is asked to speak at a gathering of Indians. Though not really an activist, Lionel goes and soon finds himself in a stolen van heading toward the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee. Pursued by police and later arrested while "carrying a gun," Lionel protests that he doesn't really "know a thing about AIM." But even after the charges are dropped, a cop tells him: "Get your life together. With your record, you're running out of options."40 Of course, as a dangerous, gun-carrying member of AIM with "a heart condition," Lionel can only get a job at Bill Bursum's Home Entertainment Center just beyond the reserve - his third mistake. King's presentation of Lionel's life as a life seemingly without options, prefigured by fictions which proceed him but which nonetheless conspire to fix his identity and limit possibility, allegorizes the familiar historic process of domination of Native Americans by written colonial narratives and "official histories" which have historically served to "invent" what it means to be an Indian. And such written histories obviously serve as oppressive and destructive colonial corollaries to the "actual" material violence and dispossession experi- enced by indigenous cultures. Historically, within such written histories Indians emerge as a collective, a static "sign" themselves, imprisoned as a "tragic" but necessary narrative of decline and ultimate erasure. Lionel's liberation from his own "written histories" fittingly comes from the power of spoken stories. Indeed, Coyote asserts the power of orality to resist such fixed narratives, to voice new forms of liberation. In The Writing of History, postmodern theorist Michel de Certeau has asserted that it is the "Native voice" that the colonial writing of history has traditionally repressed or omitted, but which potentially has the power to disrupt written history in the West.41 For de Certeau, the production of history within the colonial context and its "heteronomous variants" - ethnology, pedagogy - have been predicated on "leaving" the Natives' voices behind. Contrasting orality with the sovereignty of written inscriptions of history and ethnology, he suggests that the writing of history occurs only when the "voice" of the other is repressed, for it cannot possibly be contained. Rather, the speech of the other must be exiled from historical and ethnological reportage, made "exotic," for it is precisely that which holds the potential to destabilize the "continuity of signs" desired by such accounts. Writing thus "produces history" as an "archive" whose "will to power is invested in its form" and whose mission is the "manufacture of time and reason." The voice of the other thus comes to represents that which "cannot be put into words, ... that which would signal a 'rift,' a 'jump' in the religio-historic production of meaning."42 Similarly, Homi Bhabha stresses the importance of orality as a mode of resistance to written colonial narratives.43 Orality, suggests Bhabha, resists hegemony and encourages more "hybrid" and American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 527</page><page sequence="14">Carlton Smith communal world-views. As such, orality itself is "enunciative." As Bhabha explains, "the enunciative is a more dialogic process that attempts to track displacements and realignments that are the effects of cultural antagonisms - and articulations - subverting the rationale of the hegemonic moment and relocating alternative, hybrid sites of cultural negations."44 In Green Grass, voice and the oral traditions of which Coyote is a prominent part prove central as a liberating mode of resistance. Orality - the spoken story with its momentary presence - subverts the fixed narrative of any written tale. Spoken stories insist upon a narrative dynamism rather than codifying a static representation. Orality indeed displaces absence with an active, disruptive, and fleeting presence; it undermines the encoded narrative which seeks to contain Native American discourse. For King's Blackfoot community, stories voiced amongst friends thus hold the potential to intervene in a powerful way in the "writing" of their lives, and in Lionel's in particular. Fittingly, it is amid a cacophony of competing transcultural and intertextual voices in King's story that Lionel's story of liberation emerges. As might be expected, the moment of Coyote's intervention and Lionel's renewal occurs when Eli takes Lionel to the annual Sun Dance at the reserve. The Sun Dance is a sacred rite of transformation, of revision. And the Sun Dance is communal, a shared experience celebrating the plurality of voices of its participants. Prior to his return to the reserve and participation in the Sun Dance, Eli too, like Lionel, suffers from the prohibitions associated with his identity within the dominant culture. He too feels the pressure of "fixed narratives." Having left the reserve and earned a Ph.D. in literature, his path seemed predestined by cultural expectations, based on old stories without possibility of revision. He had become the "Indian who couldn't go home": It was a common enough theme in novels and movies. Indian leaves the traditional world of the reserve, goes to the city, and is destroyed. Indian leaves the traditional world of the reserve, is exposed to white culture, and becomes trapped between two worlds. Indian leaves the traditional world of the reserve, gets an education, and is shunned by his tribe. Indians. Indians. Indians. Ten little Indians.45 Correspondingly, Eli's own story of renewal - his acquired ability to imagine different possibilities in what once seemed to be a circumscribed future - is revealed through a series of stories that hold the key to his emancipation. And it is in the passing on of these stories to Lionel that Eli hopes to offer him a lesson, a way to change his life. This lesson occurs on the way to the Sun Dance, to which Lionel has reluctantly accompanied Eli. As they ride in a car toward the site of the annual ceremony, Eli begins to try and explain his motives for returning home, hoping it will have some resonance for Lionel. First, Eli tells the story of his wife Karen's 528 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="15">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster death and her desire to see the Sun Dance before she died. Having been afflicted with supposedly "incurable cancer," Karen agrees to go back to Eli's "home" to see the Sun Dance. Eli explains that off the reservation "everything was new" but that the idea of returning to see the Sun Dance had been important. But later, after surviving the immediate threat of her illness, Karen is killed by a drunk driver in a seemingly meaningless accident. As Eli tells the story, Lionel asks about returning home to the see the Sun Dance: "Change your life?" And Eli responds, "No ... can't say it did ... can't just tell you that straight out. Wouldn't make any sense. Wouldn't be much of a story."46 Eli's point is clear: telling the story requires other stories, perhaps even stories that go beyond him. He explains: "After [Karen] died, I thought about coming home.... But I didn't."47 Again he pauses, unable to construct his story in a way that will convey what it is he is trying to explain to Lionel. Presently the road they are driving on, which heads toward the more expansive reaches of the reservation, begins to open up. Possibility looms, but also brings fear: The road ran on in front of them, a pitch of hills and coulees that dipped and rose on the land. It had been a long time since Lionel had travelled the lease road. Normally, he came in through Fort McLeode on the road that ran to Cardston. That road was all asphalt and mileage signs and billboards. The road was a wild thing, bounding across the prairies, snaking sideways, and, each crest of the hill, the road would vanish, and they would tumble out into the tall grass and disappear.48 Along the vanishing road, disappearance becomes as possible as emergence. Here Eli again searches for the right way to explain his return. But as he does so, the car gains the crest, exposing the encampment of the Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony. The image proves resonant: "Below in the distance, a great circle of tepees floated on the prairies, looking for the world like sailing ships adrift on the ocean." At this point Eli turns to Lionel and puts his answer in the form of a question: "What about it, nephew? Where would you want to go?"49 Eli's answer about why he came home is not really an answer at all. Rather, for Lionel as well as for the story's readers, it becomes a kind of wise trickster riddle, a narrative that escapes total meaning except as a temporary assignation within involutions of other narratives. As the watery image suggests, meaning shifts, contexts float. The lesson is important, nonetheless: it is clear that the telling of stories and Lionel's understanding that Blackfoot culture is dependent upon his own telling of stories. Eli's question signals the importance of conversa- tion, the necessity of Lionel's response and his part in a communal construction of meaning. Later this lesson gets underscored at the Sun Dance itself, where Coyote and the four old Indians join Eli and Lionel. Trickster's entrance into the American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3) 529</page><page sequence="16">Carlton Smith narrative sequence is consonant with transformation, with ruptures both semiotic and psychic. This anxiety regarding renewal and the rebirth of possibility becomes evident when Eli, in the company of his family, gets into an argument with George, Latisha's white husband who derides the ceremony. "You can't believe that shit," he tells Eli, who prepares to dance. "This is ice-age crap .... Come on! It's the twentieth century. Nobody cares about your little pow wow. A bunch of old people and drunks sitting around in tents in the middle of nowhere." But rather than Eli being the one to respond to George, Lionel joins in, telling him, "There's nothing for you here."50 Lionel's response, of course, is the only thing Coyote and the four old Indians need to hear. Though they tell Lionel that "That's as much as we can do for you," he remains baffled. "That's it?" is all he can say. Then Robinson Crusoe explains: "In the years that come, . . . you'll be able to tell our children and grandchildren about this." In contrast to the ice-age rhetoric of George, the men begin to dance and the image of the camp as a renewed community becomes resonant with the promise of Eli and Lionel's vision as they approached the ceremony earlier by car: The circle was tightly formed now, the older people sitting in the lawn chairs along the front edge, the younger people standing in the back, the children constantly in motion.... In a while the dancers would return to the centre lodge and the families would go back to their tepees and tents. And in the morning, when the sun came out of the east, it would begin again.5 Lionel's healing lesson, facilitated by trickster's intervention, concerns the value of community and stories in imagining new possibilities for tradition. As might be expected, the final images of the novel return to the image of radical (un)grounding. Coyote's mischief produces an inadvertent earthquake, literally causing the ground to move, which ultimately leads to Eli's death by water as he occupies his mother's old house in the basin of the illegal Parliament dam. Rather than becoming part of a "tragic narrative," however, his death is recontextualized and instead becomes an occasion for celebration. Subsumed by the deluge he returns to the flowing water, the shifting space of eternal movement, change, and renewal - "Below, in the valley, the water rolled on as it had for eternity."52 And like the cabin - the family house symbolic of tradition - remains but a trace in memory, though alive in stories. Months later, as he stands where both Eli and the house had once been amid the sliding mud and running water, Lionel's aunt Norma tells him: "I hope you took notes...." Then, "Eli's fine, he came home." Lionel responds by saying, "Yeah ... but he didn't come home because of the Sun Dance. And he didn't come home because Granny died. He told me that."53 Ultimately, Lionel never articulates why Eli had returned home; it is left 530 American Indian Quarterly / Summer 1997 / Vol. 21(3)</page><page sequence="17">Thomas King's Green Grass, Running Water and Postmodern Trickster as a shared secret, a story within a story. And in the same way Lionel's quest for answers and identity is never resolved. "No truth but in stories," maintains King's character "I," and it is this truth which Lionel finally grasps. As readers we share in this secret, but we also must regard Lionel and Eli's story within the context of a trickster story, which seemingly always requires new acts of reading and interpretation. In King's fiction Coyote calls, cars float away, John Wayne dies, and history changes, and through these fractured, seemingly impossi- ble occasions a young Blackfoot man experiences renewal and the reader escapes the constructs of culture. When King's story finally ends it resists closure, suggesting the possibility of new stories. Coyote and "I" once again begin to "discuss how it happened." Implicitly readers are invited to construct their own meaning, to enter into liberative conversation with Coyote. As readers of a "performative" postmodern trickster tale we are indeed invited to participate, to join in the subversive potential of Coyote. Old stories change; new stories emerge. At the conclusion of King's novel we are thus reminded of trickster's sacred function within traditional oral cultures as a healer, but also as a disruptive semiotic element that resists colonial representations and stories of containment. King's conclusion, too, reminds us that many Native American postmodern trickster stories have a political and cultural agenda; they encourage us to become members of a community engaged in telling, hearing, retelling, contradicting, and reweaving, rather than in simply receiving. We, like King's protagonist Lionel, are thus beckoned by Coyote to see the world differently, to imagine new stories. Coyote's subversive "Yahoo!" signals this liberative potential.

Eli is, at least on one level, a reference to the Old Testament prophets. Like his older namesakes, Eli is a wise man whose experiences and prophesies prefigure other later narratives, in the same way that the Old testament prefigures the New. Lionel's name refers to at least several literary figures. Most obviously he recalls the Lionel involved with the Knights of the Round Table and their search for the Holy Grail. Because of his insistence upon finding meaning, his involvement in literary discussions with Eli, and his "liberal" notion that meaning will help create a better world, Lionel is also easily associated with critic Lionel Trilling. Charley Looking Bear's father's "origins" can be traced to the historical personage of Luther Standing Bear. Luther Standing Bear witnessed the Sand Creek Massacre and later traveled with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He played a political role in the final days of the Indian Wars. Ultimately he moved to Hollywood, where he played minor parts in early westerns.

Quite evidently much of post-structuralist and postmodern theory attempts to define "conventional western reception of texts" and to suggest that our reading is always more about dislocation than a single unified and essential interpretation. Barthes, Derrida, Lyotard, and Bakhtin all have much to say that is relevant to the discussion here. Stanley Fish attempts to resolve the issue through his discussion of "interpretive communities." However, Green Grass deviates from these discussions in several significant aspects. As a novel it "theorizes" itself, rather than becoming the repository/subject or object of theoretical discussion. More important, as a trickster narrative the novel marks the reader's necessary ability to recreate the text, rather denoting the ways in which the text fractures and recreates itself. For King, and for trickster fictions in general, the individual and orality combine to function as a subtextual counter-narrative to written textuality. 7.

Vizenor, Narrative Chance, 190. Vizenor's work, like this article, marks an intersection between current post-structuralist theories that emphasize how sign systems function within culture and Native American imaginative literature. While the historic evolution of the "post-structuralist turn" is obviously complex, Vizenor's own reading of post-structuralist thought follows a familiar trajectory. This trajectory connects Saussure's work on the structure of semiotic systems, to Derrida's and Lyotard's, and beyond, to a variety of post-structuralist interventions in the area of post- colonial, feminist, anthropological, and other modes of cultural criticism. While this dialogue is quite complicated, it is fair to say that these theorists have all participated in offering new ways of "reading." Reading, in this sense, not only applies to texts but to forms of "culture" and cultural production itself (such as oral narratives). Reading consequentially involves the active deciphering of the complex way that meaning is structured both by the words that are present in a text and the words that are absent. Ultimately, Vizenor work finds resonance in post-structuralism's incredu- lity toward meta-narratives (Lyotard), Derrida's insistence on seeing cultural production as a kind of text, and post-structuralism's interrogation of "writing" as it applies to colonial power in the West. While some Native American critics find such post-structuralist ideas overly Eurocentric, Vizenor locates in them an important and relevant conceptual vocabulary capable of describing the complexities of trickster stories, both postmodern and traditional. Post-structuralism's mapping of the sign as a "trace," as opposed to the seemingly "fixed" nature of Western "writing," thus informs rather than detracts from his investigations of trickster narratives. Post-structuralism's critique of signs has been followed and mediated by a range of critics that map how semiotic systems are repositories of power rather than transcendent systems of "knowledge." This, too, proves invaluable in discussing postmodern trickster's subversive potential. For excellent discussions of these issues, see Louis Owens's Other Destinies (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1992); Arnold Krupat's "Post-Structuralism and Oral Literature" in Recovering the Word (Berkeley: Univer- sity of California Press, 1992); Karl Kroeber's "Deconstructionist Criticism and American Indian Literatures," in Boundary 2 7 (1979): 73-89; and James Rupert's "The Reader's Lesson's in Ceremony," Arizona Quarterly 42, no. 1 (1986): 78-85. Indeed, Kroeber's and Rupert's early contributions in detailing the intersections of post-structuralist ideas and Native American texts prove particularly illuminating with regard to the historical evolution of these ideas and issues. 11.

The discussions of the Sun Dance here also reference other religious celebrations associated with the sun. Discussion of "I," the sun, and empire-building also are reminiscent of the Sun King, a comment on Western hierarchies and appropriations, and a pun on the name of the author as well. Like many famous film directors, King makes cameo appearances in his text. He is like Hitchcock, referencing himself in his own cinema. 19. Within traditional Blackfoot cosmology, trickster Coyote is called A-pe'si. Coyote is present at Creation, during which he helps The Old Man (Na'pe) create the world, as well as men and women, from bones and buffalo. As with other Native American trickster figures, Blackfoot Coyote's interventions are alternately disruptive and constructive. In a number of traditional tales, A-pe'se refers to Na'pe as "brother," suggesting the significance of their inter-relationship within oral Creation stories. For an oral retelling of traditional Blackfoot stories see Francis Frazer's The Bear Who Stole the Chinook (Vancouver: Douglas Press, 1991). 20. Doueihi, "Inhabiting the Space," 200. 21.

According to legend, Sequoyah believed that Native Americans would never have sufficient power to resist the Anglo incursion until they possessed writing. Sequoyah then devoted himself to the creation of a picto- graphic syllabary and to the teaching ofwriting. Alberta's efforts to teach history through pictographs raise many of the same issues. Her place in King's narrative underlines the tension and incompatibil- ity between oral stories and written history. 24. King, Green Grass, 16. 25. Ibid., 1. 26. Ibid., 6-11. 27. King plays with a variety of creation stories in his text, perhaps in an attempt to note the very absurdity of these discussions of origins. The text transforms the nearly cliched lines into a nearly Dadaist play. Coyote's lines, "In the beginning, there was nothing. Just the water ..." conflict with the western notion of origin which is expressed in terms of written language. "In the beginning there was the word ..." insists Western epistemology, arguing for an origin that began in a fixed narrative. But Coyote's moving water suggests a more mutable, dynamic story. 28.

Readers will recall how Defoe's Robinson Crusoe defined himself through his relationship with Friday. Crusoe comments at length upon the perfection of Friday, noting his physical beauty and his essential goodness of character. This ideal construction contrasts with Crusoe's depiction of himself. Hawkeye is one of the names for James Fennimore Cooper's Deerslayer, Natty Bumppo. Like Crusoe, Hawkeye's identity is defined through his relationship with the "other." And, like Crusoe, Hawkeye can be read as a place of origin for questing characters and protagonists in the literature of discovery. Hawkeye provides a paradigmatic figuration. The Lone Ranger is an interesting presence. Like Hawkeye he figures in a large number of tales, always accompanied by Tonto. But the Lone Ranger is masked; his identity is obscured. He is a crusader of unknown origin. Like all of the four-hundred-year-old Indians, the Lone Ranger appropriates a name associated with imperialism as a way of reclaiming identity. 38.
