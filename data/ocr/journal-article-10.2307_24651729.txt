<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTS H. G. Dill, W. Baumler, and A. Techmer: Early Bronze Age Mining Activities on the Island of Seriphos, Greece, 1-2, colour pi. I Man-made mineralization in underground mine works of the Mega Livadi iron-copper skarn deposit on Seriphos in the Aegean has been investigated mineralogically and dated by radio-carbon dating. Around 3325-2890 bc miners opened up the near-surface parts of the Seriphos iron-copper deposit in search of copper. The joint action of per descensum mineralizing fluids and ventilation in underground galleries was responsible for this copper-iron carbonate-humate mineralization. Richard Fletcher: Fragments of Levantine Iron Age Pottery in Chalcidice, 3-7, pi. 1 The paper examines two pottery fragments found at the site of Torone, Chalcidice, which can be attributed to a vessel type common on Levantine and Cypriot sites in the 8th and 7th centuries. The two pieces are important because they are the first ceramic evidence of contact between the Northern Aegean and the Levant at the time of expanding trade contacts in the wider Mediterranean in the 8th—7th centuries BC. Camilla Norman: Hip Pendants and Cardiophylax Ribbons: towards a better understanding of Daunian Stelai, 9-22, pis. 1—4 This paper introduces the anthropomorphic stelai of Daunia to a wider audience and investigates two hitherto disregarded elements of adornment worn by the main figure represented by the stelai. On the 'female' stelai can often be seen a pendant at the right hip, while 'ribbons' are evident hanging from the cardiophylak.es worn by the 'male' stelai. The development of these motifs are traced and their possible significance to the Iron Age Daunians explored. Eleonore Maystre: Leto in Labour? A Study of Five Artie Red-figured Fragments, 23-37, colour pis. I—III, pis. 5-6 The article presents five red-figured Attic fragments. According to a first hypothesis, the main fragment, which is the most interesting from an iconographic point of view, illustrates Leto giving birth to Apollo in Delos. However, most representations of labour show the woman about to give birth naked or very lightly dressed, whatever her status, and with her hair undone: Soranos of Ephesus reminds us that, following the principle of CTUfmaikia, everything must be loose. The position of the woman who is about to give birth is another essential element: lying down to deliver is a modern practice. In earlier times, women would be standing, sitting, crouching, or kneeling. A pyxis of the 4th century bc provides a good illustration of this: Leto is seated to give birth to Apollo. One of the article's objectives is to prove that these fragments represent Leto not during, but after, the birth of Apollo. Nicholas L. Wright: A Note on Cleopatra Tliea, Antiochus Grypus, and Athens, 39—42, pi. 7 In the last quarter of the 2nd century bc, the mint of Antioch produced an issue of bronze coinage in the name of Cleopatra Thea and Antiochus VIII Grypus which employed a reverse type of an owl standing on a fallen amphora. The type bears striking similarities with Athenian new-style coinage although it is most unusual within the Seleucid corpus. This short study investigates possible links between the two mints and makes some suggestions regarding the adoption of the type at Antioch based on political and cultural grounds. Tom Stevenson: On Dating the Frieze of Trajan's Column, 43-58. pi. 8 This paper argues against recent attempts to revise established notions about the original funerary purpose of the Column of Trajan and about a Trajanic date for its frieze. An introductory section discusses the Column as a result of funerary planning under Trajan. Subsequent discussion offers a number of positive reasons for viewing the frieze as a Trajanic work based on evidence for the construction dates of the Column, on the largely overlooked possibility of activity in the years ad 113-117. and on the evidence provided by contemporary coins.

These are additional to the corpus of 71 handles recovered in previous seasons at the site. Graeme Clarke: The Jebel Khalid Marbles, 115-18, colour pi. VI Scientific analysis shows that marble fragments of (over life-size) statuary recovered from within the temenos of the Jebel Khalid temple are made of imported lychnites-quality Parian marble—so far unique for Hellenistic Syria. C. E. V. Nixon: Jebel Khalid: Catalogue of the Coins 2000-2006, 119-61, pis. 21-8 The catalogues presents the 297 coins found during the excavations of Jebel Khalid in Northern Syria, from 2000 to 2006; it supplements the catalogue of 317 coins from the excavations from 1986 tol996. Nearly all the coins are bronze, and about 90% of them were minted in Antioch. It is argued that the numismatic evidence points to the settlement having been founded by Seleukos I Nikator (or perhaps shortly thereafter) and abandoned in the 70s or 60s BC, and that the bulk of the coins reached the site in the form of official shipments to pay a garrison and administration rather than as a result of commerce.</page></plain_text>
