Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. xiv + 1020. Price: £116.00 Hardback, £62.00 Paperback. ISBN: 978-0-521-84591-5 Hardback, 978-0-521-60842-8 Paperback. With these volumes Graham has advanced the study of the Presocratics, providing the necessary tool for all further scholarship. Taking twenty major Presocratics and sophists, along with 'Anonymus Iamblichi' and Dissoi Logoi, he presents a new Greek text of all the known fragments (with apparatus criticus) and a generous selection of the related testimonies; these have an English translation facing the Greek, in prose or free verse. In an engaging Preface he explains how his suggestion for 'a portable and up-to-date assemblage of the texts everyone should have access to for the figures everyone studies' was initially rejected on the grounds that there already was Diels-Kranz, although this was in German (with no translation of testimonies), unrevised for half a century, and with a promiscuous choice of names, many of which could hardly be called either Presocratic or philosophers. Undismayed, G. continued working on his project, found favour with Cambridge University Press (via Brad Inwood), which eventually published this splendid work. He has earned the gratitude of all who have been continually frustrated (as he was) by the shortcomings of Diels-Kranz, and the lack of a comprehensive alternative for both teaching and personal reference. We have been given, as G. explains, 'not so much an exhaustive collection as a bridge between the introductory textbook and the exhaustive collection, a kind of portable and up-to-date assemblage of the texts everyone should have access to for the texts everyone studies' (p. xiii).</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 117 The Presocratics treated in Part 1 are: Thaies, Anaximander and Anaximenes (taken individually); Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Parmenides and Zeno; Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Diogenes of Apollonia, Melissus and Philolaus (in a chronological order according to probable age). The Atomists have two sections: (i) Leucippus and Democritus on atomism in general, and (ii) Democritus' ethical fragments. Sophists treated in Part II are Protagoras, Górgias, Antiphon, and Prodicus, followed by the two anonymous texts: Anonymus Iamblichi and Dissoi Logoi. The problem of Pythagoras is dealt with as an Appendix. Each philosopher is assigned a three-letter abbreviation, each text a consecutive number, and each fragment (i.e. direct quotation or near-quotation) a consecutive number and its texts in bold, prefixed by F. The system is easily mastered, and it allows G. to dispense with the DK division of 'A' for testimonies and 'B' for fragments. Instead fragments are interspersed with their related commentaries, allowing them to be appreciated in their wider context. The twenty main chapters all start with a summary introduction to the philosopher, followed by the texts grouped according to their subject-matter, set out in a clear Greek font with the English translation in prose or a free verse form as appropriate. New fragments and testimonies that have come to light since the outdated Diels-Kranz are included. A brief commentary on the texts highlights the issues they raise, with little expansion; however, there are pointers for further study in the specific hospitable bibliography for each individual, and the general bibliography for the whole subject of early Greek philosophy and its themes. A concordance with Diels-Kranz numbering, an index of sources and passages and a general index of topics and names complete the volumes. If space were at a premium perhaps the complete text of Górgias' Palamedes (which it is admitted 'does not seem to raise philosophical issues^) might have been sacrificed for some form of specific word index or glossary to link different translations of key terms to the original Greek. And there are only two pages on 'Sources for the Presocratics'; more details here on their comparative soundness are needed to guide the unwary. (On p. 191 there is a rare evaluation of Hippolytus as the superior authority for the text of Heraclitus, B51, and on p. 426 a comparison of the dependability of Simplicius and Plutarch as sources.) The general introduction firmly names the Presocratics as innovators, who wanted to explain 'everything at once'. It may be too sweeping to claim that they 'simply ignored the kinds of explanations that were imbedded in myths', but the study of their texts will certainly be showing the relative freedom of the Presocratics from traditional restraints, and their practice both of putting old ideas to new uses and producing arguments for borrowed models and new ideas. They tended to work individually, opposing, refining and modifying the theories of predecessors and contemporaries, but G. identifies four groups to use as his framework: those who first set out to</page><page sequence="3">118 Reviews explain the cosmos; the Eleatics with their rejection of change and plurality in favour of metaphysical analysis; later cosmologists who attempted to advance on their predecessors while making concessions to the Eleatics; Socrates and the sophistic movement who concentrated on immediate human concerns and questions of moral behaviour and practical education. The figures are limited to those working in the sixth and fifth centuries, not later than Socrates in their activity. The unbiased and best method of approaching Presocratic philosophy is of course to start with the fragments and testimonia with basic guidelines, and G. has made these texts immediately accessible to the Greek scholar and the English-speaking reader. His collection in its nature is a personal one, but in its layout it allows the reader to approach the texts with a minimum of intervention. It is offered as a 'tentative reconstruction', to be a starting point for further inquiry and reflection on the 'precocious brilliance' of these first philosophers and scientists. We start with Thaïes. Although no direct quotation from Thaïes is extant, from the secondary sources G. optimistically constructs a case for some foundation for Thaïes' reputation, especially in taking the first steps in scientific philosophy. This could be demonstrated in his study of the wider context of interesting detail, such as fording the river Halys, the flooding of the Nile, measuring the distance of ships at sea, the recurrence of eclipses and the vital qualities of water, and then in the move from the context of the particular and mythical to the general natural world. The wider view is taken further with his fellow Milesian Anaximander. Using the new medium of prose, Anaximander provided an account of the natural world based on natural causes, positing a series of opposites arising from and returning to an indefinite and limitless primary apeiron , governed by known principles of time and justice. Interwoven were ideas about the origins of human life, and various astronomical and geographical data, with flashes of genius concerning the shape of the earth and the reason for its stability. Anaximander's 'inscrutable process' of explanation was soon modified by Anaximenes' adoption of air, giving the apeiron a familiar character, explaining change as the thickening or thinning of the one stuff, and deliberately relating air and the cosmos to human breath and psyche in function and structure. But in addition G. brings in testimony from the Timaeus (which is generally ignored in this context) to show Plato's sympathy with an earlier theory of change in which none of the so-called elements are stable, but merely phases in a cyclic process. Xenophanes, like his predecessors from Miletus, was an Ionian, but, driven west to escape the Persian advance, he travelled up and down the land of Hellas. He reverted to writing in verse, in many styles, being particularly famous for his rejection of the anthropomorphic gods of Homer and Hesiod, and their replacement with an all-knowing, all guiding, anonymous divinity; here he laid the foundations for a rational theology, tinged with scepticism on</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 119 the limits of human knowledge. There are also some fragments of Xenophanes on a simplified cosmology, and statements that we come from and return to earth, that earth extends indefinitely downwards (as air upwards), and that mythic terms have natural origins, as for example Iris the rainbow-goddess is merely cloud. But G. goes further, and accepts too literally the testimony of Aetius that 'there must be many suns in many regions', and so assumes for Xenophanes a world divided by an infinite plane, infinitely extending downwards and upwards, and 'all formed by the same kind of process' (pp. 96, 124). Heraclitus is perhaps the most difficult of the Presocratics to deal with. Here 171 pieces of Greek text, including 115 fragments, with translations and the apparatus of different readings, are arranged under four main headings and various sub-headings in a triumph of organisation. As G. understates, Heraclitus 'does not seem to use the traditional narration of a cosmogonical story nor a running argument', but his epigrams, riddles, puns and word plays 'do embody a new way of seeing things' (p. 136). Just two pages of introduction, however, and eleven of commentary are hardly sufficient for the range of material presented. To pick up on a couple of points in the commentary: G. accepts Heraclitus' use of 'vapor' as at least hinting at a pre-Empedocles fourth element along with fire, earth and water, and on p. 192 he criticises Heraclitus for 'rather crudely' identifying alcohol as a cause of wetness of soul (but drunkenness is a clear impediment to individual logos, causing slurred speech and lack of control over the body). With Parmenides, G. finds 'a strange mixture of literature and philosophy, tradition and innovation, revelation and epistemologa, metaphysics and science', but the choice to return to the medium of epic hexameters makes such a mixture more acceptable. G. (unusually) is particularly interested in Parmenides' cosmology, emphasising its length and achievements, and also its response to earlier theories, which are taken seriously; the discoveries of a spherical earth and moon, and the source of the moon's light, are claimed to be original to Parmenides. In the main Alētheia argument Parmenides first lists the properties that belong to what there is (not explaining them as G. states, p. 237) and then argues for them in order; the 'chains of Justice' (p. 238) surely refer to the logical force of the argument. On the different interpretations of B8.52-3, a fourth and perhaps more cogent reason for not allowing 'two forms' is that even the minimum addition of one form to the singularity of being voids the previous argument. Zeno supports Parmenides in showing that contradictory (rather than absurd) conclusions follow from accepting plurality and movement; Zeno's place in the history of Presocratic philosophy can then be shown by the options he laid out which were taken up by his successors - Anaxagoras for infinite divisibility, and the atomists for discrete minima. G. deals with Anaxagoras before Empedocles on the straightforward</page><page sequence="5">120 Reviews interpretation of Aristotle's statement ( Metaphysics 984all) that he was the older (rather than superior), although he published his work later. With a topic such as the cause of eclipses adopted by both Presocratics it is difficult to say whether one or the other was the first to make the discovery, whether it was simultaneous for them both (as often with new advances), or there was mutual contact. Similarly with the driving force of Mind in Anaxagoras and Love and Strife for Empedocles, there may have been independent recognitions that after Parmenides an explanation for movement and apparent change was needed. In his treatment of Anaxagoras, G. does not mention his most interesting theory, and most relevant today, that of an ever- expanding universe. More of Empedocles' work is extant than from any other Presocratic - 90 pages of text and testimonia in G.'s edition, but with just two pages of introduction and ten of commentary. In his presentation G. sensibly opts for two poems, On Nature and Purifications, together covering scientific topics and a reinterpretation of mythical and religious material, but for different audiences. DK B115 (on the oath of Ananke) is now fragment 8 from On Nature , and precedes B6, although this says clearly 'Hear first the four roots of all things'. (At line 3 of B115 G. still reads phonõi 'staining limbs with blood - with all the paraphernalia of bloody murder - rather than the MS phobõi 'polluting his own body from fear ... won over by raging Strife '.) The great gain in G.'s treatment of Empedocles is the incorporation of the material from the Strasbourg Papyrus according to the editing of Martin and Primavesi (1999), but here too the brevity of the commentary obscures some issues. In particular, in line 36 of the now expanded fragment 17, synerchomen is read, giving more plausibly a neuter plural subject, the elements, coming together, rather than synerchometh ' for W (the daimons), and more guidance is needed for the considerable stretch of new material relating to B139, which is introduced from the papyrus. Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Leucippus, are brought together by G. at the end of his section on Melissus as followers of Parmenides, and subject to Melissus' criticism of the incompatibility of pluralism and Eleatic metaphysics. Fair enough, but objection must surely be made to the following generalisation: 'Ever since Melissus students of philosophy have read Parmenides' Opinion as an anticosmology designed to reinforce an austere ontology ... and they have read the early pluralists as anti-Eleatics rather than Eleatics' (p. 484). Numerous 'students of philosophy' have numerous views on the cosmology in Parmenides' Opinion - Parmenides himself says that it is a dialectical device 'to outstrip anyone else's thinking'. It may well have been the case that he began in the traditional way, then become aware of logical difficulties, and started again from the most basic premise. He could then concede that, if the denial of plurality were breached by a minimum addition and two entities allowed, then a (wrongly) perceived</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 121 world of many things could be constructed. The basic pair (of fire and night) would be permanent, unchanging and self-identical, characteristics which are then developed both in Empedocles' four element theory and the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus. In his treatment of the atomists G. devotes one section to texts and testimonia relating to Leucippus and Democritus as atomists, and then gives the whole collection of 298 ethical fragments attributed to Democritus/Democrates as a further section. Again the full coverage and organisation of the material make it so much easier than with Diels/Kranz to survey the evidence and recognise the difficulties in the topic of ancient atomism, where there are few original fragments, and most of the information derives from secondary and often contradictory sources, but again just a page of Introduction is inadequate. Some of the problems include the following: 'the atomists do not engage in any significant empirical investigations' (p. 516) contrasted with 'three arguments are more physical arguments based on empirical details' (p. 619); 'atoms have no weight' (from Aetius, p. 537) whereas from Aristotle 'each of the indivisibles is heavier in proportion to its size'; a limitless number of shapes is still compatible with atoms being beneath the range of sight (Simplicius versus the notice in Aetius of atoms as big as a world); there is no 'deep engagement with problems of mind' yet human reason infers the nature of reality from experience (pp. 623- 4); and both psychological and moral responses can be extracted from the ethical fragments. On p. 525, in Aristotle's passage on atomic differences, is Wilamowitz's variation in position of I and H to be preferred to the codd. Z and N? The second volume of the two is half the length of the first, devoted to four sophists: Protagoras (with a large selection of texts from Plato); Górgias, including his Helen and Palamedes in full, but with no Platonic testimony; Antiphon, identified as the sophist; and Prodicus, where the chief text is on the Choice of Heracles, and the testimony mainly refers to his expertise in making precise verbal distinctions. But G. does not offer even a brief general introduction to the sophists, or link them either with the preceding Presocratics or their contemporary, Socrates. And the important, ongoing debate on nomos and physis , for example, has only a brief mention on p. 836; the one aid cited for understanding this debate is Heinimann's book, in German, published in 1945. A useful complement to the sophists, however, are the writings known as Anonymus Iamblichi and Dissoi Logoi , and it is a bonus to have these texts included, set out in full, in the original and in English translation. Finally the tricky subject of texts and testimony relating to Pythagoras (who left no writings) is dealt with in an Appendix. Here, transmigration is given as the only Pythagorean tenet going back to the founder, and taboos are listed, but philosophically more interesting connections between music, psychology, mathematics, cosmology and even</page><page sequence="7">122 Reviews political theory in early Pythagoreanism could be explored, and Plato's Timaeus deserves a mention in this context. Overall, the Greek text is excellent, but there are a number of misprints in the English, mostly unimportant in the omission of prepositions, although the bottom of page xi has the unfortunate phrasing 'when a passage is not found in S but not P' which I think should read 'and is in P'. Some other misprints to note are at: p. 13, 1. 34; p. 72, 1. 23; p. 130, 1. 19; p. 189, 1. 4; p. 347, 1. 27; p. 369, 1. 16; p. 529, 1. 33; p. 585, 1. 30; p. 727, 1. 20; p. 843, 1. 8; and there is only one T in 'Quintilian'. In all the pages of translation it is harsh to quibble at the individual word or phrase, but there are a few occasions when G.'s version might be challenged. Heraclitus B123, p. 161, has 4 a nature is hidden' where the sense of the active and middle verbs is lost, so perhaps 'nature has a habit of hiding herself is preferable. B45, p. 167, might be read as: 'you would not find the limits of soul, though you kept travelling along the road'; there is only one path, going deeper and deeper, so, in B 1 1 5 (the next fragment in G.), logos would be 'reasoning power', for 'the more one knows, the more there is to know'. In B43, p. 172, hybris is disputable as 'violence', and B119 would be better as: 'habit [is] human destiny', for it is the pattern of behaviour one establishes that determines one's future. The version of Parmenides, Bl. 31-32, p. 213: '... you shall learn this too, how beliefs should have been acceptable, all things just being completely' does not make sense. B7.5 refers to the 'hard-hitting argument' the goddess will put forward, rather than 'the very contentious examination', since this is the first time it has been heard. For Anaxagoras B21a, p. 309: 'what is seen gives a glimpse of the unseen' would be clearer than 'appearances are a vision of the invisible'. The Protagoras quotation, p. 707, should probably be understood as: 'for every argument there is a counter- argument'. In his Preface G. says that, after years of labour, he sends his book into the world with trepidation, but he should feel more confident and deserving of congratulation. These two volumes of complete fragments and selected testimonies are a magnificent achievement, absolutely indispensable for any ordinary mortal 'wresting a harvest' as he quotes 'from the broad-based earth'. When this work is taken together with The Oxford Handbook of Presocratic Philosophy (2008), which he edited with Patricia Curd, a second spring is heralded for the Presocratics. M. R.
