<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Studies !73 THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SINCE 1945 By H. G. MCINTYRE, Lecturer in French at the University of Strathclyde 1. GENERAL G. D. Chaitin, 'From the Third Republic to postmodernism: language, freedom and the politics of the contingent', MIN, 114:780-815, advances on a broad front but, in the process, offers a number of useful sections on Sartre and La Naus e, on contingency and Sartre's political thinking and on Sartre's relationship with the dissident student movement and the non-Communist left, as well as Bergson and La Naus e, all of which will be of interest to the literary scholar. E. Kushner, 'La survivance du mythe d'Orph e au XXe si cle', RLC, 73:615-29, makes reference to a number of modern adaptations of the Orpheus myth by Segalen, Cocteau, Anouilh, and Pierre Emmanuel. 2. AUTHORS BATAILLE. R. M. Pyrczak, 'Les espaces du sacr : le vide, le bord, le seuil, le renversement et la relation au sacr dans la fiction de G. B.', DFS, 48:115-26, considers assorted motifs in B., principally in Le bleu du ciel, among which are living 'au bord des choses' or examples of renversement, actual or physical as well as semantic. These various motifs are related to le sacr in B. or are to be seen as manifestations of the desire to d sacraliser, eye-opening stuff in places, particularly in its exploration of the erotic in B. BEAUVOIR. J. Hardwick, 'Keeping it together and falling apart in S. de B.'s La Femme rompue', EFL, 35-36:165-77, offers a post modernist rereading of the novella intended to counter the tendencies to view de B.'s writing as merely philosophical or straightforwardly realist. In particular, self-reference in La Femme rompue undermines the realist assumption of coherence or wholeness normally associated with diary-type fiction. Margaret A. Simons, Beauvoir and 'The Second Sex': Feminism, Race and the Origins of Existentialism, Lanham-Oxford, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, xx + 262 pp., is not primarily a literary study but a philosopher's attempt to set the text in the broad context of the history and politics of the feminist movement, de Beauvoir's own ideas, her personal relationship with Sartre, her philosophical differences with him, and the influence of his thinking on the book. There are transcripts of two interviews with de B., conducted in 1979 and 1982. J.-A. Pilardi, Simone de Beauvoir, Writing the Self: Philosophy becomes Autobiography, Westport, CT, Greenwood-Praeger, 135 pp.</page><page sequence="2">174 French Studies M. Fraser, Identity without Selfhood: Simone de Beauvoir and Bisexuality, CUP,x + 216 pp. BECKETT. S. E. Cant, In search of 'lessness': translation and minimalism in B.'s theatre', FMLS, 35:138-57, defines lessness as 'the lowest common denominator of stage and word in which meaning is redefined through a process of reduction', and examines B.'s pursuit of the analogous goals of self-translation and minimalism in three plays: En attendant Godot, La derni re bande and Pas moi. The breadth of reference is broader than this, in fact, but only serves to underline the ultimate irony that, even in the search for 'style lessness', the pursuit of reduction and estrangement creates a new form of style. S. E. Gontarski, 'Revising himself: performance as text in S. B.'s theatre', JML, 22:131-46, sets out to correct the bias towards the written text in B. criticism by charting B.'s evolution from playwright to theatre artist, from writer to director. It demon strates how B.'s growing expertise and confidence as director of his own work led to constant revision of his existing texts and increased the importance of rehearsal and performance in determining the shape of new work. The consequent headaches for his publishers anxious to print a 'definitive' text are illustrated by examples of continual revision from e.g. Play, Come and Go and Footfalls. X. Gamier, 'Les personnages gigognes de S. B.', Po tique, 117 :47-56, divides the characters of the trilogy into the M series (Molloy, Malone, Mahood etc.) and the W series (Worm, Watt) and distinguishes between mobile and immobile individuals. Having no particular axe to grind, it lingers on such incidentals as the significance of le b ton, represented by Malone's stick or even Molloy's crutches. G. Gasarian, 'Po sie et po tique chez B.', ib., 119:317-42, addresses the apparent paradox of B.'s 'aust re conomie', 'd pouillement extr me' and flight from 'style' on the one hand and the extraordinary poetic power of his writing on the other. The bulk of reference is to En attendant Godot but the article ranges widely from B.'s 'manie cr puscule', via 'drame et dialogue' to 'les voix du sujet et du silence'. BONNEFOY. A. Pearre, 'Le bouddhisme et la po sie con temporaine: Y. B.' DFS, 46:167-78, points to the interest in Zen Buddhism which can be discerned throughout B.'s work and which may have been sparked off* by his discovery of the Japanese poet Basho, translated by Ren Sieffert in 1968. The main attraction of Buddhism for B. would seem to lie not so much in the temptation to anti-rationalism as in the 'harmonie des contraires' it proposes. BUTOR. F. Cox, 'A modern day Aeneas: Virgil's journey through B.'s La Modification', Cox, Virgil, 132-58, covers already well documented ground but concentrates on establishing parallels between the doomed love of Dido and Aeneas and Delmont's</page><page sequence="3">The Twentieth Century Since iQ4f 175 relations with his wife and mistress. The discussion subsequently increases in breadth and interest to encompass parallels with Dante and Beatrice, Delmont's personal vision of Rome, and his views of history and Fascism while not losing sight of La Modification as a nouveau roman and as a 'lesson in how to read and how to write'. B. Valette, Etude sur Michel Butor: La Modification (Coll. R sonances), Ellipses-Marketing, 94 pp. CAMUS. N. Harrison, 'C., criture blanche and the reader, between Said and Barthes', NFS, 38:55-66, is essentially a study of L'Etranger, sandwiched between the conflicting views of Barthes and Said as to whether the text is neutral and innocent (Barthes) or guilty of concealment of and complicity in the colonial situation in Algeria (Said). The key to gauging the extent of C's engagement is the degree to which he invites the reader to identify with Meursault. While in theory the text creates various obstacles to this process of identifica tion, there are ways in which the two divergent views can be at least partially reconciled in practice. L'Etat de siege, ed. P.-L. Rey (Coll. Folio Th tre), Gallimard, 1998, 225 pp. S. E. Bronner, Camus: portrait of a moralist, Minnesota U.P., xii + 179 pp. CARDINAL. E. Hoft-March, 'Clytemnestra's desire: M. C. and the mythical maternal', DFS, 48:155-64, considers C's exploration of the maternal, which raises questions unasked or unanswered by Freud's Oedipal analysis, and her gravitation towards the Clytemnes tra myth, principally in Les mots pour le dire and Le pass empi t . cixous. M. Noonan, 'Performing the voice of writing in the in between: H. C's La Ville Parjure', NFS, 38:67-79, analyses the play as a preamble to asking in what ways it represents an evolutionary step in C's project for a 'feminine' theatre as set out in 1977. Instead of the playful reworking of language we find in C's earlier fiction and the undermining of theatrical convention in earlier plays, we have a more traditional reliance on the power of metaphor and a number of striking images. What La Ville Parjure dramatizes is the tension between C's public vocation to engage her audience in reflection on contemporary socio-political conditions and her private or personal vocation as a poet to give expression to her own unconscious self. L. A. Jacobus and R. Barreca, H l ne Cixous: Critical Impressions, Amsterdam, Gordon &amp; Breach, xv + 333 pp. DEGUY. Litt rature, 114, is a special number to mark D.'s departure from the Department of French Literature in Paris VIII. It contains a range of contributions of varying complexions from the personal and self-indulgent to more structured studies. Among the more interesting contributions are: C. Monchard, 'Deguy aujourd'hui' (5-16), which provides a useful initial survey of man and work; L. Finas, 'Le vent, c'est beaucoup plus que le vent' (35-41), which provides a similarly</page><page sequence="4">176 French Studies informative introduction to D.'s most recent work, L' nergie du d sespoir, while J.-M. Rey, 'La rh torique profan e5 (42-53), is a more in-depth look at the same work, emphasising the recurring idea or motif that D. 5s poetry is haunted by a mouvement de fond which he defines as 'une profanation des figures5; H. Meschonnic, 'Le rythme dans la figure ou il faut soigner ce rhume5 (56-63), is a collection of random, general reflections on rhythm; C. Monchard, 'Deguy, Du Bellay et le temps de la po sie5 (64-81), considers the relationship between the two poets with the help of D.5s Tombeau de Du Bellay, B. Clement, 'La colonie pr liminaire5 (82-92), discusses La Machine matrimoniale ou Marivaux in which D. sketches a kind of ar s po tica not so much for the writer as for the reader; C. Elson, 'Anthropomorphose: l'humanisme dans la po tique de M. D.5 (93-106), explores approaches to defining humanism in D.5s work and that anthropomorphism which is one of the 'sens principaux5 of his writing. DURAS. M.-C. Barnet, 'Ecrire, disent-elles: la vocation litt raire dans L'Amant de Duras et L'Enfance de Sarraute5, DFS, 48:101-14, shows how the two romans-r cits in question evoke, in a mixture of fact and fiction, the awakening of a literary vocation in their respective authors. It looks beneath the surface dissimilarities between the ' coli re mod le5 (Sarraute) and the 'petite d lur e5 (Duras) and finds a similar 'ambigu t absolue5 in both writers5 approaches to writing about writing. C. Blot-Labarr re, Dix hemes et demie du soir en t de Marguerite Duras (Coll. Folioth que), Gallimard, 206 pp. ERNAUX. N. Morello, 'Faire pour la m re ce qu'elle [n5]avait [pas] fait pour le p re: tude comparative du projet autobiographique dans La Place et Une Femme d'Annie Ernaux', NFS, 38:80-92, centres on two novels from the eighties in which E. explores her relationship with her father and mother respectively. Both books seem to serve a similar therapeutic purpose for E. since she attempts to expliquer and disculper her mother in Une Femme by placing her in her socio-cultural context as she had done already for her father in the earlier La Place. L. Day,6Ce qu'ils disent ou rien in Annie Ernaux's trajectory as a writer', EFL, 35-36:178-205, concentrates on this middle panel of the early triptych comprising also Les Armoires vides and La Femme gel e which precedes La Place. Anne's adolescent reading and first attempts at writing reflect E.'s natural concerns as developing writer and the subtext of the novel addresses fundamental questions of form and technique which preoccupied E. in the 70s and may not have been resolved by the 90s. This broad and detailed study concludes that Ce qu'ils disent ou rien 'argues the need for a kind of writing which it does not itself deliver'. L. D. Kritzman, 'Ernaux's testimony of shame', EsC, 39.4:139-49, is devoted to an analysis of La Honte in which E. seeks to come to terms with feelings of shame and guilt occasioned</page><page sequence="5">The Twentieth Century Since 1945 177 by a traumatic childhood event injune 1952: witnessing a scene of domestic violence between her father and mother. While this attempt to translate trauma into words helps E. confront her feelings, it also reveals the impossibility of achieving true cognition. N. C. Cottille Foley, 'Abortion and contamination of the social order in Annie Ernaux's Les Armoires vides', FR, 72:886-96, not only regards abortion as a powerful expression of social alienation but argues that using the womb as a mode of representation and creating various associations allows E. to reverse common dichotomies and transgress binary oppositions. GENET. V. Kocay, 'Language and truth: Sartre, Bataille, Derrida on Genet', DFS, 48:127-45, undertakes a comparison of three very different approaches to G.: Sartre's monumental study, Bataille's (partial) reply, and Derrida's enigmatic Glas. Least space is given to the most substantial of these, on the grounds that it is already the most familiar; Bataille's Genet is analysed more as a reading of Sartre than G.; and there is a commendable and welcome attempt to shed some light on Glas. F. Ekotto, 'Shamelessness as a creative mechanism in Jean Genet's Notre-Dame des Fleurs and Dany Laferri re's Comment faire l'amour avec un N gre sans se fatiguer', EsC, 39.4:80-89, compares two novels which deal with the shame of exclusion, symbolized for the subjects by containment within confined spaces. Both writers use shamelessness as a mechanism to deflect the stigma of shame but this analysis distinguishes between the reactive or weak shamelessness felt by L.'s characters and G.'s exploration of a strong 'shame-lessness' which tries to transcend the binary opposition of the shameful and the shameless. GRAC ). C. J. Murphy, 'Gracq, lecteur de Poirier', FR, 72:696-708, confronts the writer-critic J. G. and his alter ego, the history-geography teacher Louis Poirier, finding unsurprisingly themes and preoccupations familiar in G. in his other self e.g. the same attitude to the relationship between man and his environment. The most interesting section is that on 'Gracq autographe' which notes the feminization of certain spaces in G.'s texts and suggests that geographical space and autobiographical space in G. both centre on 'un espace qui figure le maternel'. LE CLEZIO. J. L. Dutton, 'Du paradis l'utopie: ou le r ve atavique de Le Cl zio' EFL, 35-36:206-17, acknowledges the well documented prominence of the paradis theme in Le C. but makes a distinction between that and the less obvious utopia theme. She uses this idea to construct a grille de lecture which is applied to two works, Chercheur d'or and Voyage Rodrigues. These are already 'un ensemble indissociable' on autobiographical grounds, but charting the progres sion from paradis to utopie suggests a more nuanced and less obvious</page><page sequence="6">i78 French Studies complementarity between them. M. Salles, Etude sur J. M. G. Le Clezio: D sert (Coll. R sonances), Ellipses-Marketing, 96 pp. LEDUC. C. Viollet, 'Violette Leduc, une sinc rit intr pide?', DFS, 47:133-42, calls into question the autobiographical assumption made by many about L.'s work and initially fostered by Simone de Beauvoir. The article offers some fascinating background glimpses into L.'s successive reworkings, transpositions, and emendations of biographical materials which demonstrate that here is a permeable membrane separating fact from fiction in her writing. S. Marson, Le Temps de l'autobiographie: Violette Leduc, Vincennes U.P., 1998, 259 pp., considers the ambiguities implicit in the autobiographical enterprise and those factors which contribute to blurring the distinction between autobiography and r cit, principally the ambivalent position of the author as narrator and character. It is an informative and thought provoking mixture of detailed comment on L. and issues of wider relevance. C.Jansiti, Violette Leduc: biographie, Grasset, 488 pp. MiCHAUT. Litt rature, 115, is a special number devoted to Michaut. J. P. Martin, 'Les n s-fatigu s me comprendront' (3-13), considers different definitions of the idea of fatigue in M.'s writing. J.-C. Mathieu, 'Portrait des Meidosems' (14-30), is a close look at the series of lithographs and texts making up the collection. R. Bellour, '400 hommes en croix' (31-41), examines the image of the crucified Christ. V. Metzger, 'Po mes et prose: quelques r critures', (42-7), emphasizes, with the aid of some examples, the importance of those 'quelques moments de rencontre' when M.'s prose reinterprets or rewrites his verse. G. Dessons, 'Lire la peinture' (48-54), tackles the relationship between the written and the pictorial and how the 'reading' of one complements the other. Dong Qiang, 'Ac rer la plume, "lac rer le vide" ' (55-69), is a reading o Id ogrammes en Chine but can be hard going without an inside appreciation of Chinese calligraphy. J. Roger, 'Ponge, lecteur de Michaut: un diff rend sans merci' (70-86), examines, in a detailed and wide-ranging fashion, the enigmatic relationship between these two contemporaries and the clash of'deux po tiques inconciliables'. MODIANO. G. Neumann, Aux carrefours de la vie: le chien dans les romans de Patrick Modiano', AJFS, 37:246-64, concentrates initially on identifying canine references, allusions and images in Villa Triste in order to illuminate neglected aspects of this particular novel but, using the insights gained thereby, the article develops into an interesting survey of a number of other texts up to the most recent Dora Bruder. There is ample illustration which confirms the existence of a surprising wealth of themes associated with the discrete but significant presence of man's best friend in M.</page><page sequence="7">The Twentieth Century Since 1945 !79 OBEY. C. Turrettes, 'Ambigu t d'une Iphig nie moderne: une fille pour du vent d'Andr Obey', RHT, 99:171-81, points out the ambiguous mixture of ancient borrowing and modem addition and emendations in O.'s treatment of the Iphigenia myth. It is argued that O.'s distortion, indeed inversion, of the story is not merely ludic in nature but is intended to raise questions in his contemporary post war audience about pacifism, ambition, and the lust for power. piNGET. F. Cox, 'The good shepherd: Virgil in the novels of Robert Pinger', Cox, Virgil, 189-214, examines the presence of the Bucolics in two novels, LApocryphe and Th o ou le Temps neuf, analysing how the Virgilian intertext is exploited to convey a characteristic nouveau roman sense of textual instability and of the instability of the world in general. PONGE. D. Sears, 'The prose poem and Ponge's Proeme\ EsC, 39.1 -.60-70, begins with some observations and speculations on the origins and significance of the term pro me, then tackles two texts 'on the limits of prose and poetry': Strophe and De la modification des choses par la parole. A detailed contrastive textual analysis of both illustrates how the conflict of poetic and prosaic codes in P. results in the creation of a hybrid genre. Francis Ponge et Jean Tortel: Correspondance 1944-81, ed. B. Beugnot and B. Veck, Stock, 322 pp. ROBBE-GRILLET. B. Stoltzfus, 'La Belle Captive: Magritte, Robbe Grillet et le Surr alisme', FR, 72: 709-18, argues that the inclusion of 77 pictures by Magritte in La Belle Captive suggests links between Surrealist aesthetics and those of the nouveau roman. The dual character of La Belle Captive as commentary on both the mystery and ludic structures of Magritte's painting and also the processes of the nouveau roman leads the reader into the same 'jeu' as making sense of the nouveau roman narrative. The article also suggests a number of specific links between the book and the 1938 edition of the Oeuvres completes de Lautr amont, introduced by Breton and illustrated by Magritte and others, and the 1948 edition of Les Chants de Maldoror, illustrated by Magritte alone. R. Ramsey, 'Visual generators as pre-texts in Robbe Grillet's new novels', AJFS, 36:229-45, examines the relationship between text and images in a variety of R.-G. works, in particular the use, repetition, and transformation of pictorial sources. The discus sion is interesting for its range of detailed, specific references. SALACROU. Hyo Suk Jo, 'Les formes de la mort dans le th tre d'Armand Salacrou', RHT, 99:21-40, is a clear and orderly survey of the obsessive theme of death in S. under various headings: physical death represented by suicide and heroic self-sacrifice for a noble cause, spiritual death, and 'la mort de l'avenir' i.e. old age. SARRAUTE. M. L. Lee, 'L' criture et la vie: Nathalie Sarraute', DFS, 47:143-54, reflects on the long creative career of S. and asks</page><page sequence="8">i8o French Studies what is the relationship between life and writing for her, what writing means for her and if the passing years have changed this relationship. After some biographical details and observations on her preferred place and methods of working, the answer emerges as a paradox. It is the separation of life and writing, in a sense the manque de moi in S.'s writing, which is the key to understanding her work. J. Rothenberg, 'Gender in question in the theatre of Nathalie Sarraute', FMLS, 35:311-20, tests S.'s claims not to be concerned with gender issues against the evidence of her plays, finding in them an evolution in the treatment of gender and character from Le Silence ( 1964) to Pour un oui ou pour un non (1982). This does not reflect the evolution discernible in her non-theatrical writing since it is less easy in the theatre to blur the distinction among the gendered relationships and stereotypes of the conventional bourgeois society she portrays. J. S. Gjerden, 'Le portrait selon Nathalie Sarraute. Configuration du sujet moderne dans Portrait d'un inconnu et Ici, RevR, 34:265-84, draws a parallel between S.'s interest in Arcimboldo's portraits in her late 1995 text lei and her original project in Portrait d'un inconnu to create a series of original configurations of the modern subject. The comparison becomes threefold since the replacement of the sujet autonome by a new sujet ouvert, defining itself solely by virtue of its 'ouverture l'autre' suggests an unexpected parallel with Levinas. A.-C. Gignoux, 'Nathalie Sarraute, une le on de rh torique', LR, 53:137-43, regards Ouvrez as a kind of treatise on rhetoric or 'r flexion m talinguistique' and therefore a departure from S.'s usual preoccupations with tropismes in favour of words or personnages-mots. The argument identifies in Ouvrez the five divisions of rhetorc and the analysis is structured under these headings: invention, elocution, disposition, m moire, and action. V. Minogue, 'Nathalie Sarraute (1900-1999): a tribute', RoS, 17.2:iii-vi, records the death of N. S. on io October 1999 and offers in homage an overview of her major works and achievement. SIMON. F. Cox, 'La Bataille de la phrase: Virgil in the novels of Claude Simon', Cox, Virgil, 159-88, despite the title, deals mainly with La Bataille de Pharsale and Les G orgiques. On the other hand, it draws not only Virgil but also Lucan, Caesar, and others into the intertextual discussion. In La Bataille de Pharsale, the proliferation of sources and the discrepancies between them, plus the role of memory, contribute to the polyvalence of meaning basic to the nouveau roman. In the relatively more harmonious and accessible Les G orgiques, the debatable degree of Virgilian influence and the predominance of the Orpheus myth are assessed. L. Fraisse, 'La lentille convexe de Claude Simon', Po tique, 117:27-46, examines, principally in La Route des Flandres and via the various implications of the convex lens motif, aspects of spatial representation and dislocation. There is much</page><page sequence="9">The Twentieth Century Since 1945 181 reference to Proust and some allusion to other of S.'s novels. J. H. Duffy, 'Artistic biographies and aesthetic coherence in Claude Simon's Jardin des plantes3, FMLS, 35:175-92, notes a shift of focus in S.'s latest novel away from the paintings and sculpture on which he draws in earlier fiction and towards the biographies of the artists themselves, in this instance Novelli and Picasso. Despite this change of focus, however, the analysis sets out to demonstrate that S.'s reservations about biography or the biographical approach to literature have not altered and Le Jardin des plantes is based on the same compositional or creative principles as his earlier fiction. SOLLERS. P. Forest, 'Le Roman, divine autofiction: sur Lettres aux ann es de nostalgie de Kenzabur O et Le Coeur absolu de Philippe Sollers', RLC, 73:47-61, chooses two novels 'd'une tonnante proximit ' but without suggesting any mutual influence between them since the S. novel was published in 1987 and the Japanese novel not translated until 1993. Any similarity derives from their common exploitation of Dante's Divine Comedy, but a sustained comparison under a variety of headings e.g. space and time, the narrator and his double, Ulysses in Paradise, etc., makes for an interesting and readable study. TOURNIER. V. Tumanov, 'Black and white: Michel Tournier, Anatole France and Genesis', OL, 54:301-14, is a hypo/hypertextual exploration of the first chapter of Gaspard, Melchior et Balthazar which details points of correspondence between the T. hypertext and its hypotext, Anatole France's short story Balthasar (1889), as well as T.'s apparent use of the sister-wife hoax motif which occurs three times in Genesis. C. Anderson, Michel Tournier3s Children: Myth, Intertext, Initi ation, NY, Lang, 1998, 145 pp., attributes T.'s marginality in relation to major literary trends to his straddling two seemingly incompatible genres: children's literature and serious high quality fiction. This study explores T.'s 'myth' of adult-child relations, one of initiation and growth, of mentorship and partnership between child and adult, drawing our attention in particular to the thematic and textual roles of childhood in T. and the role of the author/narrator as a guide to childhood reading. The book is divided into two major sections 'Children as agents' and 'Children as readers' and is well structured and readable throughout. A. Bouillaguet, 'De Defoe Tournier: le destin ou le d sordre des choses. Sur trois incipit', EF, 35:55-64, considers the relationship between what the author terms 'le d sordre des choses' and the workings of the forces of destiny in three texts, Robinson Crusoe and Vendredi ou les limbes du pacifique in its two versions, the original and La Vie sauvage. The gist of the argument is that destiny is present and has manifested itself already in Vendredi in the form of tarot cards whereas the world of things is less sinister or worrying in</page><page sequence="10">l82 French Studies La Vie sauvage since the tarot cards have been replaced by ordinary cards. J.-P. Zarader, Robinson philosophe: Vendredi ou la vie sauvage de Michel Tournier, un parcours philosophique (Coll. Philo-essais), Ellipses Marketing, 207 pp. YOURCENAR. J. S. Alesch, 'Le Cours des devises in Margu rite Yourcenar's M moires d'Hadrian', FR, 72:877-85, draws attention to the dual function of narration in M moires d'Hadrian via the conflict between the 'narrative' of his life and reign which Hadrian constructs in official formulas and the existence of a hidden alternative 'narrative' version of his life, crystallised in the suicide of Antino s which Hadrian cannot understand or come to terms with.</page></plain_text>
