ABSTRACT Engineering efforts directed at better occupant safety require a thorough understanding of available epidemiologic data. Epidemiologic studies using clinical as well as accident information facilitates the prioritization of biomechanics research so that controlled laboratory experimentation and/or analytical models can be advanced. This information has also value in dictating levels and types of injury that are critical to the development of anthropomorphic test devices used in crash environments. In this paper, motor vehicle accident related (excluding pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists) epidemiologic data were obtained from clinical and computerized accident (National Accident Sampling System-NASS) files. Clinical data were gathered from patients admitted to the Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, and fatalities occurring in Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin. NASS database with specific focus on spinal injuries of motor vehicle occupants was also used. The purpose of the clinical study was to determine the most commonly injured anatomic levels of the cervical spine, to classify these injuries based on an impairment scale, to determine the mechanism of injury at each spinal level, to evaluate the differences, if any, between the patient (survivors) and fatality data with respect to the location and mechanism of injury, and to compare this data obtained from a localized population with literature results and national samples. The purpose of the NASS study was to estimate the annual occurrence of cervical and thpracolumbar spinal injuries, to elicit the gross anatomical distribution of these injuries (eg., cord vs. skeletal); to tabulate the distribution of these injuries by crash type (i.e., frontal, side, rear, and rollover); to estimate the risk of these injuries as a function of crash type, and restraint use, and finally, to briefly explore the association of craniofacial trauma with spinal injury. Results indicated that while injuries to the cervical column are complex and may occur at any spinal level, they concentrate statistically in two primary zones, at the craniocervical junction for fatal victims, and in the lower «cervical spine for survivors. The majority of paralyzing ipjuries (survivors), both complete and incomplete quadriplegia, were produced by flexion- compression loading, with disruption of the posterior elements and compressive fractures of the vertebral bodies. However, rotation appeared to be an important component in non-paralyzing cervical fractures. A strong association was found to exist between craniofacial and cervical spine trauma. While only cervical spine injuries were evaluated from the clinical database, analysis of NASS files included both cervical and thoracolumbar spine. Results indicated that the thoracolumbar injuries at AIS 3+ level were primarily bone related (96%). In contrast, neck trauma at this severity was 20% cord and 65% bone related emphasizing the relative importance of protecting the spinal cord in this region. For the cervical spine, within the limitations in the ensemble size, introduction of restraints appeared to significantly reduce the incidence of injury at the AIS 3+ level, while increasing at the AIS 1 level. However, little change was observed at the AIS 3+ level for the thoracolumbar spine. IN SPITE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN pre-hospital stabilization and transport, as well as in comprehensive centers for definitive treatment, spinal injury continues to represent a health care problem of major proportions. Spinal cord injuries carry very high risks of disability and fatality [33*. Data from the National Head and Spinal Cord Injury Survey [19] estimated that 40% of spinal cord injuries (SCI) occur in motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Another study, conducted in a localized area in the U.S., reported that 58% of all SCI were due to MVA [21]. Krauss reported that in industrial countries 38 to 65% of SCI are from MVA [20]. It is estimated that approximately 7,250 new cases of transport related cervical spine trauma with spinal cord injury occur annually in the United States. Approximately 75% of these receive fatal injuries at the scene [22]. Sixty-four percent of transport related injuries are reported to occur to passenger car (53%) or truck/bus (11%) occupants. Even with the wide- scale use of restraints, in the European population, it has been recognized that spinal cord injuries are still an important outcome from motor vehicle accidents, particularly for the driver. *Numbers in square brackets [ ] indicate references.

Epidemiologic studies using clinical as well as accident information facilitates the prioritization of biomechanics research so that controlled laboratory experimentation and/or analytical models (such as finite element models) can be advanced. This information also has value in dictating levels and types of injury that are critical to the development of anthropomorphic test devices used in crash environments. In this paper, epidemiologic data has been obtained from three different sources. They are: (a) patient (survivors) records from the Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals involving automobile accidents (pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists excluded), (b) fatalities occurring in Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, due to MVA in the year 1987, and (c) computerized National Accident Sampling System (NASS) database with specific focus on spinal injuries of motor vehicle occupants. The purpose of the clinical study was to determine the most commonly injured anatomic levels of the cervical spine, to classify these injuries based on an impairment scale (defined later), to determine the mechanism of injury at each spinal level, to evaluate the differences, if any, between the patient (survivors) and fatality data with respect to the location and mechanism of injury, and to compare this data obtained from a localized population with literature results and other national samples. The purpose of the NASS study was: to estimate the annual occurrence of cervical and thoracolumbar spinal injuries, to elicit the gross anatomical distribution of these injuries (eg., cord vs. skeletal); to tabulate the distribution of these injuries by crash type (i.e., frontal, side, rear, and rollover); to estimate the risk of these injuries as a function of crash type and restraint use, and finally, to briefly explore the association of head and face injury with spinal injury. METHODS CLINICAL DATA Survivors - The available medical records and radiographs from adult patients admitted to the teaching hospitals of the Medical College of Wisconsin between 1980 and 1987 with the diagnosis of cervical spine fracture or cervical spinal cord injury were reviewed. The teaching hospitals include the Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Milwaukee County Medical Complex, and The Children's Hospital of Milwaukee. A database form developed by the authors, incorporating etiology, mechanisms, neurologic status, radiographic results, management, and outcome (Appendix A) was used. Mechanism of injury was determined based on radiograph review, clinical information, and other available data from the medical records (such as lacerations and bruises) regarding the accident profile. Trauma was graded on an Injury Score (IS). Briefly, the IS was based on impairment. An IS of 2 refers to no SCI but dislocation, spinous or transverse process fracture without cord contusion and laceration; 3 refers to no SCI, but with atlanto-occipital or facet or lamina or pedicle or odontoid fracture or simple vertebral body compression; 4 refers to incomplete SCI (with some preservation of spinal cord function below the level of injury) with or without any accompanying fracture or dislocation; 5 refers to complete quadriplegia of the middle-lower cervical spine (C4-C7 vertebral levels); and 6 refers to complete quadriplegia of the remainder of the cervical spine (C3 and above). A comparison of IS and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is given in Table 1. Fatalities - All automobile fatalities occurring in 1987 in Milwaukee County were reviewed. For this purpose, autopsy reports from the medical examiner's officer were used [18]. Data collected included cervical spine fracture level and spinal cord status, if any, related demographics, associated trauma, and etiology (such as passenger versus driver, and alcohol use). Data was analyzed for the most frequent level of cervical spine injury. In these clinical data (survivors and fatalities) only automobile occupants were included. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and occupants involved in buses were excluded. COMPUTERIZED ACCIDENT FILES - The National Accident Sampling System (NASS) database for the years 1979-1986 was interrogated with specific focus on injuries to the cervical and thoracolumbar spine of motor vehicle occupants. The NASS files are samples of accidents occurring within the United States, which are weighted to provide national estimates for numbers of crashes and resulting injuries occurring in each year. The extensive information in the files includes details concerning the accident site, vehicle(s), and vehicle occupants. Particular emphasis is placed on factors related to vehicle damage and occupant injuries. The following filters were applied in the creation of the sample population for the purposes of this study: vehicles: Passenger cars, light trucks, and vans occupants: Drivers and right front passengers occupant age: &gt;16 years ejection status: Ejections and partial ejections excluded rollover status: Non-rolling vehicles and vehicles rolling at least 1/4 turn included In addition, occupant restraint was defined to include three-point belts, two-point belts, and automatic belt systems. Airbag restraints were excluded from the study. RESULTS CLINICAL DATA Survivors - Two hundred eighty-nine patients were discharged from the Medical College of Wisconsin hospitals following treatment of cervical spine injury between 1980 and 1987. These patients were divided into three groups based on the degree of spinal cord injury. They were classified into complete quadriplegia, incomplete quadriplegia, and intact patients. Of these 289 patients, 90 had complete quadriplegia, 83 had incomplete paralysis, and the remaining 116 had skeletal injuries with no cord involvement (Table 2). Of the 90 quadriplegics, 40 were drivers or passengers in automobile accidents. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of these quadriplegic injuries by vertébral level. The most common levels of injury were C5 and C6, with 15 occurring at C5 and 17 occurring at C6. There was one survivor each at Cl, C2 and C3, two at C4, and two at C7. The most common mechanism of injury (a description is given in Appendix B) was judged to be flexion- compression (nine at C5 and nine at C6), with wedge or comminuted fractures of the vertebral body and associated disruption of the posterior elements. Burst fractures with vertebral body injuries (no compromise of posterior elements) were also more common at the C5-C6 level (one at C5 and six at C6).

Eighty-three cases of incomplete paralysis were reviewed. Thirty-two were related to automobile accidents. The mechanism of injury (Appendix B) could be judged in 26 patients. The most common levels of injury were C5 (11 cases) and C6 (9 cases). Seventeen were considered to be flexion-compression type injuries. Four were associated with axial loading (burst fractures), and three were extension type injuries. In two cases, rotation forces were involved. As noted in Figure 2, C5 and C6 were the most common levels of injury. One hundred sixteen patients were admitted for treatment of cervical injuries with no spinal cord involvement. However, in these cases, nerve root compression may have occurred. Of these 116 patients, 33 were occupants of automobiles. Similar to the incomplete and complete quadriplegic groups, these cases also demonstrated a preponderance of lower cervical (C4-C7) injuries. The only exception was seven instances of extension injuries of the axis (C2). There were ten fractures at C6, six at C5, and four each at C4 and C7. The most common mechanism was considered as flexion combined with rotation, leading to asymmetric spinal injuries, particularly of the facets and pedicles. Nine fractures occurred at C2, eight of the odontoid process (Figure 3). On the basis of the dislocations produced and associated trauma, seven were felt to be related to flexion loading and one related to extension. Overall, flexion-compression loading was implicated in ten of the 33 automotive injuries, and flexion-rotation in another ten. Table 3 includes a summary of cervical spine injury data of the 105 patients discharged from the Medical College of Wisconsin Hospitals. It includes the severity of iiijury at each vertebral level based on the IS. The lower cervical spine, especially at the C5-C6 level, was the most commonly involved region of the neck. Fatalities - Seventy-seven motor vehicle related fatalities were reviewed from the autopsy reports available [18] at the medical examiner of the Milwaukee County in 1987. Cervical spine injury was considered to be a major contributing factor in only 3 of these 77 fatalities. Of these 77 fatalities, there were 46 (60%) drivers, 20 (26%) pedestrians, and 11 (14%) passengers. Out of 42 accidents in which automobile occupants were involved thirty-two were identified as being drivers and 10 were identified as passengers . In these 42 cases, 9 victims had evidence of neck injury. Cervical spine injury was considered to be the cause of death in 3 cases of atlanto-occipital (A-O) dislocation and transection of the spinal cord. All victims were drivers. Cervical fractures at C4 and C7 levels occurred in two of the remaining six cases, and in another Figure 1: Distribution of spinal injuries with complete quadriplegia (data from MCW hospitals).

In two other cases, cervical spine fractures were also observed. Most victims also suffered multiple trauma, particularly head and thoraco-abdominal injuries.

It may be noted that the number of injuries at the AIS 3+ level for restrained occupants is relatively small. One reason for this result is that only 20% of the occupants included in the study population were restrained. Estimated Annual Injuries - Raw data was then weighted according to NASS protocol, and annual estimates were then calculated for spinal injury counts (Table 5). It should be noted that these estimates reflect the fleet composition and restraint use frequency of the period 1979- 1986, and that they are subject to change in response to the current flux in these variables. With this caution in mind, the data of Table 5 suggests that while the cervical spine is the more frequent site of AIS 1 and AIS 3+ injuries, the thoracolumbar spineA sustains the majority of injuries at the AIS 2 level. Iniurv Distribution bv Svstem/Organ - The distribution of cervical and thoracolumbar spinal injuries by system/organ is presented in Table 6. (This and all subsequent analysis utilized weighted data.) At the AIS 3+ level, thoracolumbar injuries seem to be dominated by skeletal/vertebral injuries (96%), while injuries to the thoracolumbar cord are relatively infrequent (3%). In contrast, 20% of cervical injuries at the AIS 3+ level are cord injuries, while the balance of cervical injuries are primarily skeletal/vertebral (65%), respiratory (7%), and nerve injuries (4%). When cervical and thoracolumbar injuries are combined and the distribution of injuries to the whole spine re-examined, it is found that cervical injuries account for 66% of all spine injuries at the AIS 3+ level. Figure 4 shows the relative contributions of cervical and thoracolumbar AIS 3+ injuries to whole spine injury. It is seen that combined thoracolumbar spine refers to the thoracic and lumbar spine, not the thoracolumbar junction. skeletal/vertebral injuries account for 75% of whole spine AIS 3+ injuries, while combined cord injuries account for 15%. Distribution of Injuries bv Crash Type - Further analysis was conducted to determine the distribution of cervical and thoracolumbar injuries by crash type; i.e., front, side, rear, and rollover (Table 7). The NASS primary general area of deformation (GAD1) variable was utilized for the categorization of front, side, and rear exposures. Roll classification was performed independently, because of the unique nature of the rollover environment. Thus, vehicles falling into the roll category were not further classified by the GAD1 variable. Insufficient data was available to allow disaggregation of restrained occupant data by crash type. Therefore, Table 7 includes data for unrestrained occupants only. Data extracted from Table 7 is presented in graphical form in Figure 5. It is clear, at the AIS 3+ injury level, that frontal, side, and rollover crashes are all major contributors to both cervical and thoracolumbar spine injury. For the thoracolumbar spine, frontal exposure dominates the AIS 3+ distribution. Rear exposure gains significance at the AIS 1 injury level for both the cervical and thoracolumbar spines. The crash type category other found in Table 7 and Figure 5 includes vehicles with undercarriage damage and/or top deformation in the absence of rollover. The contribution of these unusual crash types is generally small; however, they appear to be a larger factor in thoracolumbar injuries at the AIS 2 level. It is not presently clear whether this result is of physical significance. Incidence Rates of Cervical and Thoracolumbar Injuries - Where data resources were judged sufficient, incidence rates of cervical and thoracolumbar injuries were calculated. Incidence rates were calculated as numbers of injuries sustained per 1000 occupant exposures in the crash and restraint environment of interest. Incidence rate calculations are presented in Table 8 ánd Figure 6, which compare overall incidence rates of spinal injury by crash type, for combined restrained and unrestrained populations. (It may be recalled that restrained occupants represent approximately 20% of the population in the study sample). Table 8 entries marked with an (*) were calculated from small data samples, and should be utilized with caution. At the AIS 2 and AIS 3+ injury levels, rollover exposures clearly are associated with the highest injury risk, both for the cervical and thoracolumbar spines. It may also be noted, at the AIS 2 and AIS 3+ levels, that both frontal and side crash exposures carry lower but comparable injury risks to the cervical spine. Rear crash exposures carry highest risk for AIS 1 injuries to the cervical spine. Injury incidence rates as a function of restraint use are provided in Table 9. For the cervical spine, introduction of restraint appears to markedly reduce injury incidence rate at the AIS 3+ level, while increasing it at the AIS 1 level. For the thoracolumbar spine, little change is seen in injury incidence rate at the AIS 3+ level. Association of Head and Face Iniurv with Spinal Injury - The database was further queried to investigate the association of cervical and thoracolumbar spine injuries with head or face injuries. Table 10 summarizes the extent of this association in the study population, for both the cervical and thoracolumbar spines. Seventy percent of cervical spine injuries at the AIS 3+ level were associated with concurrent head and/or face injury. In fact, this percentage may be somewhat low, since some under- 1794</page><page sequence="6">TABLE 4: Spinal Injury Counts in NASS 1979-86: Raw Data Cars, Light Trucks and Vans Drivers and Right Front Passengers cravraL THORACOLUMBAR AIS Unrestrained Restrained Unrestrained Restrained Ī 6¿76 2¿68 3Ā86 928 2 238 51 291 41 St m ZZ 2 12 Source: NASS 1979-86 Figure 4: Distribution of AIS &gt; 3 injuries to the spine in automotive crashes. 1795</page><page sequence="7">TABLE 5- Estimate of Annual Spinal Injuries to Cars, Light Trucks, and Vans Drivers and Right Front Passengers (Ejection Injuries Excluded) Figure 5: Distribution of spinal injuries by crash type (Unrestrained front seat occupants). 1796</page><page sequence="8">TABLE G- Distribution of Cervical and Thoracolumbar Injuries by System/Organ (%) CERVICAL THOR/LUMBAR CERVICAL THOR/LUMBAR SYSTEM/ORGAN AIS 1.2 ABS 1,2 AIS 3+ AIS2± Arteries/Veins --- --- 1.4 Cord - - 20.1 3.3 Digestive --- --- 1.0 Integumentary 5.4 18.5 Muscles 92.2 73.1 - 0.1 Nervous System --- --- 4.3 0.5 Respiratory 0.1 --- 7.1 Skeletal 1.0 4.2 27.2 52.9 Vertebrae 1.2 4.1 37.8 43.2 Unknown/All Systems Q I 01 10 = 100% 100% 100% 100% Sample Size (raw data) (N=8916) (N=4445) (N=232) (N=91) TABLE 7- Distribustion of Spinal Lyuries by Crash Type and Injury Level Unrestrained Drivers and Right Front Passengers CERVICAL SPINE ABl AB2 AB£t Frontal 37 45 43 Side 21 21 27 Rear 35 10 3 Rollover 6 22 26 Other _1 2 I 100% 100% 100% Sample Size (raw data) (N=4117) (N=173) (N=167) THORACOLUMBAR SPINE ABl AB2 AE3t Frontal 31 33 65 Side 26 15 13 Rear 23 5 2 Rollover 18 30 15 Other 2 1Z 5 100% 100% 100% Sample Size (raw data) (N=2106) (N=186) (N=58) 1797</page><page sequence="9">TABLE 8- Incidence Rates of Spinal Injury by Crash Type (Injury Counts per 1000 Exposures) Combined Restrained and Unrestrained Occupants CERVICAL THORACOLUMBAR AIS1 als 2 AIS 3+ AISi AIS2 AIS3t Frontal 62 1.7 1.4 26 1.7 1.0 Side 65 1.6 1.8 41 1.8 (*).38 Rear 270 2.0 (*).65 93 1.3 (*).34 Rollover 82 8.9 7.3 ICQ 13 Ł2 ♦Small sample size (raw data counts &lt;= 15) TABLE 9- Comparison of Incidence Rates of Spinal Injury by Restraint Use (Injury Counts per 1000 Exposures) CERVICAL THORACOLUMBAR AISI ATS 2 AIS 3+ AISJ AIS2 AIS 3+ Unrestrained 82 2.1 2.1 42 3.0 .94 Restrained 120 2£ £4 33 L2 £3 TABLE 10- Frequency of Head/Face Injury in Association with Spinal Injury CERVICAL INJURIES AISI AE2 AIS3+ Percent of Cervical Spine 28 38 70 Injuries at Stated AIS Level with Associated Head or Face Injury THORACOLUMBAR INJURIES AE1 AE2 AIS3+ Percent of Thoracolumbar 29 30 57 Spine Injuries at Stated AIS Level with Associated Head or Face Iniurv 1798</page><page sequence="10">Figure 6: Incidence rates of spinal injury by crash type (Injury counts per 1000 exposures). reporting of low AIS level injuries to the head and face may exist in the automated NASS files. DISCUSSION Various epidemiological and injury biomechanical studies have been reported in the literature [1-5,7-21,24-29,32- 35]. The epidemiologic data have been examined in three different perspectives: patient (survivor) data based on medical records, fatalities based on roentgenographs and/or autopsy reports, and computerized accident files using National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), NASS or Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) files. The results of the present study are compared and discussed with literature data. In the present study, the clinical (survivors and fatalities) database was selected for the analysis of severe injuries. In contrast, the computerized accident files (NASS 1 979-1 986) database was selected to study the distribution of injuries over a broader spectrum, i.e., vehicle environment (eg., crash type) as well as occupant details (eg., injury distribution by system/organ). Combining these two approaches sheds light on the problem of delineating injury characteristics for fatalities and survivors together with accident details. The clinical data on fatalities includes only victims of automobile occupants excluding pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists. Despite the fact that the sample size used in the present study was too small (9 cases of cervical spine injury), the data supports the hypothesis that craniocervical junction and the upper region of the cervical spine are the most vulnerable regions of the neck. The epidemiological aspects of fatality data, in the literature, has been traditionally reported based on radiographic examination [1,2], and/or macroscopic pathological evaluation of the victims' body [7,11]. Although, in all these studies a detailed analysis of the motor vehicle occupants excluding pedestrians, motorcyclists and bicyclists was not explicitly reported, the data, almost unequivocally, supports the above stated hypothesis! Figure 7 illustrates a comparison of the data from the present study with literature. In comparing the results from literature (Table 11) the differences in the method of data collection discussed above must be noted. Therefore, exact comparisons become difficult. In spite of this, the fatality data indicates a preponderance of upper cervical injuries over mid and lower cervical injuries, presumably because of the associated brainstem and the loss of spinal cord tracts which control the respiratory function in this region. The mechanism of cord trauma and paralysis in these high cervical injuries has been studied [6], Brieg suggests that the brainstem and spinal cord are best considered as a single continuous fiber tract, and stresses applied at more distant regions are transmitted cranially in the cervical region. In most cases of atlanto-axial dislocation, the spinal cord appears to be either transected or severely compressed [11]. However, in some instances, the dynamics of the head-neck complex are such that the long-tract fibers in the upper cervical cord as well as brainstem may be disrupted, producing respiratory paralysis and fatality [6]. Many investigators suggest that A-0 dislocation occurs mainly in ejections and pedestrian accidents [1,2]. The present fatality data, on the other hand, emphasizes that this may be an important cause of death in non-ejected occupants of automobiles. Earlier biomechanical studies have indicated that injuries of the atlanto-axial region is secondary to local flexion loading. However, the extension mode is also implicated in the production of trauma [29]. Similarly, Alker, et al reported the majority of upper cervical lesions to be related to flexion, including A-0 dislocations, as well as odontoid fractures, to be discussed later [1,2]. An important exception was the "hangman's fracture", not seen in any of the cases presently reviewed. Here, hyperextension produces fractures through the pedicles of axis and C2-C3 dislocation. However, with greater degrees of dislocation, C2 quadriplegia and respiratory paralysis may occur, with extremely high early mortality rates. 1799</page><page sequence="11">Present study Davis et al (1 971 ) Cord 50-1 1 60-1 ri o 30 - vX//1 1 īiļļ ° o 30 - vX//1 ° t»-p !:p AÂ. . ^ v,//Ay///ì OC C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 OC C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 Spine Level Spine Level Davis et al (1971) Osseous Alker et al (1975) 40 1 üü 40 1 ¿ 30 - ¿30- pp o - - ,^|11 " „1 ^ ékmimMMÊk CC CI C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 OC C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 Spin« Lev.l Spin# L,v#| Alker1978 Bucholz (1978) "O" 40 MàÀMmmmM 0 OC C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 OC C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 Spin« L«v«l Spin« L«v«l Figure 7 : Comparison of fatality data from literature Table 11: Anatomic Location of Cervical Spine Injury Among Fatalities (%) Spinal Level Number of MVA Investigator/Year QÇQ o Í2 C3 C4 C5 CR C7 Cases Cases Remarka Davis (1971) 14 522011025 Spinal cord (56) (20) (8) (8) 0 (4) (4) 0 (100) 02721041 16 Osseous Q 02) m (12) (6) 0 1251 (1001 Alker (1975) 87 10 1122031 31 m (23) (22) (3) (3) (71 (71 o noni OOQ) Alker (1978) 19 21 30 7 3 5 5 8 98 02) (ä) (3D (Z) (3) (5) 157 (81 fi 001 Bucholz (1979) 8391012024 2ł (S) 02) Í3Z) (4) 0 (4) (9) 0 (1(101 (120) Present Study 310011017 9 In 2 out of 9 cases (43) 04) Û Û 04) 04) 0 04) (100) OOP) data was incomplete 1800</page><page sequence="12">The injury score used in this study to analyze the severity of injury is slightly different from the AIS (Table 1). The latter is based on "threat to life" or, in other words, it reflects the impact on survival. The emphasis is on the multiply injured victim. However, in analyzing the data base for survivors, we were more interested in the outcome of the isolated spinal injury. Consequently, the injury was scored (IS) based on impairment in contrast to the AIS methodology. For example, AIS 3 and 4 include spinal cord injuries as well as fractures of the spine. Additional morbidity associated with paralysis and its devastating effect on the patient justified a higher impairment score for these injuries. Figure 8 includes a histogram indicating the relative frequency of injuries in survivors. A comparison of the results from the present study with literature data is also illustrated in the figure. Because sufficient elaborative documentation of the injuries was not available in all the earlier studies, the data was grouped into two regions: OC- C2 and C3-C7 vertebral levels. Table 12 includes a summary of the data indicating the share of MVA from different studies. The hypothesis that lower cervical spine is the more frequently injured region of the neck than the upper cervical spine among survivors is confirmed. Although the present data is skewed to small localized population which may not be nationally representative, the predominance of lower cervical spine injuries is underscored. The present investigation reveals a strong association in NASS between head/face injury and serious cervical spine injury. This result confirms an observation made by Ommaya, et al, for unrestrained vehicle occupants in the NCSS file [24]. Similar observations have been made by others. Davis, et al reported that cervical SCI were associated with an overt evidence (46%) of brain damage in a fatally injured population [11]. Among survivors, Harrington and Barker reported head injuries in 46% and 52% of the cases in patients with C1-C3 and C4-C7 spine injuries, respectively [16]. Another study reported that head and facial fractures were commonly assoicated in patients with cervical spine trauma [25]. Of all the patients with cervical spine fractures, 41% had assoicated skull fractures or closed head injury and 27% had facial fractures [25]. Patients with thoracic and lumbosacral spine injuries also had associated skull fracture or closed head injury (40% and 17%), and/or facial injury (25% and 0%). In a focused study on 107 C2 fractured patients, Hadley et al found an incidence of 40% for associated head injuries [14]. Burke, et al also reported that head injuries were the most frequently associated trauma (56%) in patients from road accidents with spinal injury [8]. In a recent Belgian study, Careme reported that fractures to the atlanto-occipital junction and the axis are almost always the result of head contact [9]. It appears reasonable to conclude that head impact with the vehicle interior is a significant causal agent in cervical spine injury, especially at the higher injury severity levels. Axial, shear, bending and torsional loads transmitted to the cervical spine by the skull appear to be the primary agents in this regard. The beneficial overall role of belt restraint in the reduction of serious cervical spine injuries, as identified in the present NASS data analysis, is most probably due to inhibition of head/face to vehicle contact. At present, restrained occupant injury data is not available in NASS in sufficient quantity to permit a detailed examination of belt restraint effectiveness by crash type. As the number of restrained occupants increases in future additions to NASS, this analysis will become feasible. An important implication for anthropomorphic test device (ATD) neck development from the above discussion is that dynamic biofidelity of the ATD neck (accuracy of load transmission to the neck via head/face contact) is required for credible injury assessment using ATD neck force and moment measurements. This analysis indicates that restraint use has the corollary effect of increasing the incidence rate of cervical spine injuries at the AIS 1 level. Some additional injury risk at the AIS 1 level appears to be the trade-off for improved protection from more severe injury. However, it should be remembered that many cervical spine injuries at the AIS 1 level can themselves involve significant impairment and disruption of work and social relationships. The very large number of AIS 1 cervical spine injuries estimated to occur annually, exceeding 500,000 cases, is in itself cause for serious concern. Crashes involving rollover are associated with the highest cervical spine injury incidence rates, at the AIS 2 and AIS 3+ levels. This result may be understood in terms of the higher average severity crash condition which rollovers represent, and in terms of the greater potential offered for head, face, and neck contact with vehicle interior components during the complex roll sequence. It is important to recall that ejections were removed from the NASS study population; had they been included, it is likely that rollover crashes would have been even more seriously implicated with regard to occurrence of spinal injury. Some selection in the clinical database undoubtedly took place: until recently, few patients survived upper cervical fractures associated with paralysis. With recent advances in scene resuscitation, survivals are now common. Thus, in a few years, epidemiologic studies may show a change in the frequency x&gt;f injuries at different cervical levels. Similarly, with increasing restraint usage, the pattern of cervical spine injuries may also demonstrate differences in the severity and nature of neck trauma. The present study confirms that the craniocervical junction is the most common site of trauma in fatal spinal injury from MVA. These appear to be related to local flexion or local extension loading. Similarly, many non-fatal injuries (survivors) in the same region (i.e. odontoid fractures) are related to flexion. An important exception to this is the "hangman's" fracture, or spondylisthesis of C2, related to hyperextension. Among survivors, cervical spine injury associated with spinal cord trauma is most frequently seen in the lower cervical spine. The mąjority of paralyzing injuries, both complete and incomplete quadriplegia, are produced by flexiön-compression loading, with disruption of the posterior elements and compression fractures of the vertebral bodies. However, rotation appears to be an important component in non-paralyzing cervical fractures. Because there is no substantial data in this area, it is important to understand the combined effects of the introduction of rotation in conjunction with the other force vectors on the biomechanics of the cervical spine. The results of this multifaceted study indicate that while injuries to the cervical spine are complex and may occur at any spinal level, they concentrate statistically in two primary zones, at the occiput-C2 and in the lower cervical region, primarily around C5-C6. This result confirms, in general terms, the approach presently taken in ATD neck instrumentation. That is, multiaxis force and moment transducers are presently available for placement at the top (occiput location) and bottom (C7-T1 location) of the ATD neck segment.

A measure of torsional neck moment is not available, however, in the present ATD neck transducers. Since this study has identified rotation and shear resulting in a combined torsional loading of the cervical spine as a frequent mode of load application, addition of this measurement capability should be considered. It is probable that torsional dynamic biofidelity of the existing ATD neck segment would require improvement, to permit the meaningful introduction of this additional measurement. CONCLUSIONS 1. Cervical spine injuries from MVA primarily concentrate at the occiput-axis in the upper cervical region, and primarily around C5-C6 in the lower cervical region. 2. The craniocervical junction and upper regions of the cervical spine (OC-C2) are the most common sites of trauma in fatal spinal injury from MVA. 3. Among survivors with spinal injury from MVA, the lower cervical spine is more frequently injured region than the upper cervical spine. 4. A strong association exists between craniofacial injury and serious cervical spine trauma; the overall beneficial role of belt restraint in the reduction of serious cervical spine injuries is most likely due to inhibition of head/face with vehicle contact. 5. Dynamic biofidelity of the ATD neck (accuracy of load transfer to the neck via head/face contact) is required for credible injury assessment. 6. Serious cervical spinal cord injuries were 14 times greater than those observed in the thoracolumbar spinal cord in automobile crashes. 7. While serious thoracolumbar injuries were primarily bone related (96%), serious cervical spine injuries were 20% cord and 65% bone related emphasizing the importance of protecting the spinal cord in this region. 8. Within the limitations of the sample size, introduction of restraints appeared to significantly reduce serious cervical spine injuries. In contrast, little change was observed for serious thoracolumbar injuries. We have identified, based on epidemiologic data, critical regions of the human cervical column that are susceptible to injury in an automotive environment. The results of this analysis may be used to focus and prioritize injury biomechanics research, in an attempt to develop tolerance criteria for the human neck. It may not be possible to develop a unified set of criteria; instead, the most common types of injuries may need to be considered as syndromes, occurring in different types of accidents and requiring biomechanical investigations targeted towards each of them. Anthropomorphic test devices or mathematical models should focus on the critical regions and loading patterns discussed in this paper.

FLEXION-RELATED INJURIES COMPRESSION-FLEXION - This is perhaps the most common injury observed in motor vehicle accidents. It commonly involves, a decreased height in the anterior region of the vertebral body with or without fractures of the vertebral elements or associated posterior elements. Since ligamentous failure is not radiographically visible in contrast to bone failure, the disruption of ligaments must be deduced from the residual bony displacement, retrospectively. For example, fanning or splaying of the spinous processes can generally be regarded a disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex. In clinical situations, ligaments fail in tension and shear but not in compression. 1806</page><page sequence="18">In compression-flexion, the vertebral body is sometimes displaced posteriorly into the canal as well as being altered in height anteriorly. This injury mode may be associated with comminution. Typical mechanisms responsible for this type of injury are impact with the front header, the A pillar, or other stiff components in the frontal region of the vehicle during a frontal or off-frontal impact or alternatively, an impact with the rear header or other stiff regions of the vehicle secondary to a rear-end crash. This injury can also occur in rollover situations if the occupant interacts with various interior components of the vehicle. HYPERFLEXION - Hyperflexion commonly results in the presence of significant flexion forces on the spine. It is associated with bilateral locked facets and dislocation of the spine. The vertebral bodies may not be altered as it is predominantly a ligamentous-disc injury. There is anterior dislocation of the spinal column above with respect to that below. Bilateral locked facets usually suggest that the dislocation is such as to disrupt the posterior and anterior ligament complex to allow for the superior facets to jump the inferior facet complexes with an associated displacement of more than 50% of a vertebral body. The facets are sometimes fractured during this sequence. Hyperflexion occurs secondary to force applied posterior to the vertex similar to that associated with a full Nelson and routinely occurs during rollovers with head-roof contact, or with substantial roof encroachment into the occupant compartment. EXTENSION-RELATED INJURIES COMPRESSION-EXTENSION - Compression- extension injury mechanisms have been described by Fortheyte. These often result in fracture of the spinous process at one or more levels, with or without accompanying fractures of the other posterior bony elements. These injuries are often observed during roof deformation producing extension forces to the cervical column. HYPEREXTENSION - Hyperextension is one type of injury often associated with a hangman's fracture. Alternatively, with sufficient distraction Ring fractures have been reported by Clemmons and Burrow during vehicular whiplash studies or those observed by the pathologists secondary to high-speed racing car accidents. Ring fractures or distractive forces are also, sometimes, associated occipital-atlanto dislocations. These are often observed with vehicular-pedestrian accidents since the pedestrian's head-neck complexes accelerate substantially causing avulsion of the ligamentous complexes. Hyperextension is primarily due to extension and tension forces on the cervical spine. The most common occurrence in motor vehicle accidents is from rear-end impacts (whiplash). This routinely involves the soft tissues of the head-neck complex. These injuries have significant societal implications. Teardrop fractures, disc-body separations may also occur. Typical mechanisms responsible for this type of injury are rear-end impacts, loading of the chin with dash/instrument panel or other rigid constructs in the vehicle or, impacts of the forehead with the windshield/header typically for unrestrained occupants. AXIAL LOADING AXIAL COMPRESSION - Vertical (axial) compression is commonly considered as axial loading with the lordosis of the spine removed. That is, the head-neck complex will be pre-flexed so as to remove the curvature of the cervical column. This type of loading can result in a Jefferson fracture or compression of any of the vertebral bodies often associated with comminution and/or blow-out fractures. With blow-out fractures, the mechanism for injury is usually the retropulsion of the vertebral body into the spinal canal. Severe axial loading can also produce posterior element fractures, although ligaments are not typically involved. These types of injuries are often observed in vehicular accidents during rollovers or, with axial alignment and impact with stiff interior components such as pillars or headers of the automobile. AXIAL TENSION - This type of injury is rare in motor vehicle accidents. It is associated with pure tension and may result in disruption of the total ligament complex at any level with stretch injury to the spinal cord. These injuries are sometimes observed in pedestrian-vehicle accidents. LATERAL FLEXION Lateral flexion is associated with an asymmetric force applied to one hemisphere of the head producing compressive lateral flexion or acceleration lateral flexion. Lateral flexion injuries are often observed with impacts of the side or roof rail of the vehicle secondary to lateral or substantial off-frontal collisions. They may also be observed in rollover accidents. Typically one-side of the spinal column is distracted while the other side experiences compression injuries. Many of these injuries are also associated with rotation. ROTATION INJURIES Very few of the above injuries are pure (unimodal). The majority are associated with some degree of rotation. With pure rotation, the ligamentous complex is often disrupted at one level or the vascular supply principally from the vertebral basilar complex is altered. Rotation can produce unilateral locked facets with the left facet complex locking secondary to clockwise rotation and the right facet locking secondary to counterclockwise rotation. SHEAR Pure shear is rarely observed in the cervical spinal column. It often occurs along with the previously described classifications. Either rotation or shear injuries can occur under a variety of vehicular type crashes. All of the above delineated injuries can occur secondary to ejection when the victim impacts an external object. APPENDIX C: ANATOMY OF THE CERVICAL SPINE The spinal column is composed of 33 vertebrae joined by ligaments and cartilage. This includes seven cervical (C1-C7), twelve thoracic (T1-T12), five lumbar (L1-L5), five fused sacral and one coccygeal vertebra resulting from the fusion of four separate bodies (Figure CI). The normal adult spine includes four curves: the cervical and lumbar lordosis, and the thoracic and lumbosacral kyphosis. The anatomy of the vertebral elements varies in the different regions, reflecting the functional requirements in each area. The head rests on the atlas (CI) which consists of a bony ring with anterior and posterior arches. It has large lateral masses containing the articular surfaces (facets). The superior facets move on the occipital condyles of the skull and the inferior facets articulate with the body of C2, 1807</page><page sequence="19">the axis (Figure C2a). The body of C2 has a superior projection often referred as the dens or odontoid process. The odontoid process is located at CI and is maintained in contact against the inner anterior aspect of the arch of CI by ligaments (Figure C2b). The third through the seventh vertebrae (C3-C7) are similar. The most prominent feature of the vertebra is its body located anteriorly from which vertebral arches extend posteriorly. This arch is composed of the pedicle, the articular facets having both superior and inferior portions, and the laminae which come together posteriorly to close the arch. The vertebral foramen is thus formed through which the spinal cord and coverings pass. Extending laterally from the arch is the transverse process and posteriorly is the spinous process (Figure C3). Pedicels are pillar shaped masses just anterior to the facets between the neuroforamina. The lamina of the cervical spine are narrow and imbricated with the caudal bodies of a given lamina slightly overlapping the superior aspect of the lamina below. The spinous process are short and bifid. The vertebrae are interconnected anteriorly by the disc between each successive body (Cl and C2 are exceptions) and posteriorly by a synovial joint between superior and inferior articular facets of adjacent vertebrae. Because of the peculiarities of the atlas and axis, there is no disc between Cl and C2. Intervertebral discs are fibrocartilagious structures which attach to the vertebral bodies centrally via the hyaline cartilagious endplate and peripherally via ligaments and fibers of the annulus. The annulus is the outer component made of fibrous tissue arranged obliquely which surrounds the central nucleus pulposus made of mucopolysaccharides with a high water content. Ligaments and joint capsules preserve the articulated nature of the spine, allowing a requisite but restrained movement; they may connect agacent vertebrae or extend over several segments. The ligaments are composed primarily of elastin and collagen. Since the skull, atlas, and axis are devoid of discs,' this region has some unique ligamentous complex (Figure C2). Typical ligaments in the C2-C7 region are shown in Figure C4. Cervical 7 Figure Cl: Lateral and postero-lateral views of the human spinal column. There are seven cervical, twelve thoracic, and five lumbar vertebrae, with 23 intervertebral discs. The articulating facets are very important in the cervical spine because they allow rotation and movement. They provide posterior support for the spine for the "tripod" effect when considered with the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. The presence of articulating facets acts as a secondary loading path for the transmission of external forces. The facets change in shape from cervical through the lumbar spine, but at all levels provide articulations between the superior and inferior levels of the spine. An abrupt change in the direction planes of the facets between the skull-C3, and around the cervicothoracic junction (C7-T1) is characteristic of the human cervical column. The largest amount of flexion occurs in the lower cervical elements; in contrast, the largest amount of extension occurs at occiput-Cl level followed by the lower cervical elements. The greatest axial rotation occurs about the odontoid process, and lateral bending at C2-C3. The combination of the architecture of the cervical facets, the attendant ligaments, joint capsules, and soft tissues permit these complex motions of the cervical spine. Since the superior articular surfaces of the facets slope in a antero- cranial to posterocaudal direction, neither pure rotation or pure lateral flexion are possible. These movements are always coupled. The vertebral artery is the major source of blood supply for the cervical cord and cervical spine.

The axis (C2) has the prominent odontoid process around which the atlas pivots to give the neck its primary rotating capability. 1808</page><page sequence="20">the anterior and posterior spinal arteries. The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior column of the central gray cells in the ventral and lateral columns including the cortical spinal, spinal thalamic, and other ventral and lateral tracks. The posterior spinal system supplies the posterior column and posterior horn of the central gray cells. Venous blood returns from the spinal cord by way of a comparable system of anterior and posterior channels. The anterior system is comprised of three veins that run parallel to the longitudinal anterior spinal artery and one of these accompanies the anterior artery in the median ventral fissure. While few permanent cervical vascular injuries occur in vehicle accidents, knowledge of the arterial supply of the spinal cord is important in their analysis. Catastrophic injuries to the cervical column involve permanent alteration of the spinal cord. This routinely occurs when the spinal cord is compromised in the spinal canal. The average dimension of the cervical spinal cord is 13 mm lateral width x 7 mm in anteroposterior direction. The largest diameter of the cervical spinal canal is in the upper cervical region. The spinal canal is lengthened by flexion and shortened by extension. During extension it is often narrowed by the folding of the ligamentum flavum. Considerable variation in the size of the spinal canal can exist; therefore, persons with narrow canals are at a greater risk for cord damage. Degenerative diseases of the spine, including cervical spondylolysis, metabolic bone disease, and stenosis can reduce the size of the canal.

Note that the anterior atlanto-occipital membrane is a continuation of the anterior longitudinal ligament and the tectoral membrane continues inferiorly as the posterior longitudinal ligament. The posterior atlanto- occipital membrane is functionally in the same place as the ligamentum flavum. Figure C3: A typical cervical vertebrae.
