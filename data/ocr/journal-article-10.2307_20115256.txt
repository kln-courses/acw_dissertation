ZAHLER CATASTROPHE THEORY AS APPLIED TO THE SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES: A CRITIQUE* When we propose to apply mathematics we are stepping outside our own realm, and such a venture is not without dangers. For having stepped out, we must be prepared to be judged by standards not of our own making and to play games whose rules have been laid down with little or no consultation with us. Of course, we do not have to play, but if we do we have to abide by the rules and above all not try to change them merely because we find them uncomfortable or restrictive. M.Kac / agree with P. Antonelli when he states that theoretical biology should be done in Mathematical Departments; we have to let biologists busy themselves with their very concrete - but almost meaningless - experiments; in developmental Biology, how could they hope to solve a problem they cannot even formulate?

INTRODUCTION 'Catastrophe theory' denotes both a purely mathematical discipline describing certain singularities of smooth maps, as well as the concerted effort to apply these theorems to a wide variety of problems in fields ranging from linguistics and psychology to embryology, evolution, physics, and engineering. Scarcely eight years old, this 'applied' catastrophe theory (ACT) has reaped wide spread praise: ? "The most important development since calculus" (Newsweek) ; ? "Affords novel and deep insights into the world in which we live" (New Scientist); ? "The Promised Land may be in sight at last" (Science).

ZAHLER find themselves suddenly sought after: all kinds of people are curious about the new world of cusps and butterflies, and how it can explain so many things. There is no question that ACT has strong appeal. The wit and enthusiasm of the catastrophists is stimulating. Gracefully convoluted surfaces, labeled with terms like 'fear', 'cost', 'attack', and 'crash' appear to give surprising and fresh insights ? about the stock market, war, anger ... and sometimes testable predictions. The mathematics is said to rely on deep theorems, yet is easy to explain to the layman. There is even a 'catastrophe machine' that a seventh-grader can build for the science fair. Although we too admire the ingenuity that characterizes the best of ACT, we are skeptical. We feel that the claims of ACT are exaggerated and its real accomplishments so far are meager. In fact, in dealing with problems in the biological and social sciences, catastrophe theorists have - misused the basic mathematics in ways that lead to indefensible arguments; - offered models which are based on unreasonable assumptions and which lead to implausible conclusions; - made predictions which are frequently vacuous, tautologous, vague, or impossible to test experimentally. We will document these charges below by an examination of several models considered by the catastrophists themselves to be especially success ful.1 In a later paper we will extend our detailed criticisms to cover all currently suggested areas of application of catastrophe theory to the biological and social sciences. We emphasize that the validity or importance of CT from a mathematical standpoint is not at issue here. We are concerned only with evaluating the usefulness of CT as a tool for extra-mathematical applications. It may be asked why it is necessary to write a paper with such a negative purpose. Aside from the obvious reason ? to alert researchers to the danger of investing valuable effort in a field which may not be as promising as it sounds ? we feel that we are articulating the feelings of the sizeable segment of the mathematical community that is eager for new applications of mathematics, provided always that they are legitimate. The intriguing pictures and abstruse theoretical foundations of CT ? fully understandable only to a small number of mathematicians ? may impress some people who would</page><page sequence="3">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 119 easily see through a similarly weak theorem based, say, on straightforward differential equations or statistical methods. Furthermore, like other critics of ACT, we feel that we are fulfilling a duty towards the scientific community by presenting our criticisms. Perhaps they will even help stimulate catastro phists to vindicate their theory by creating more carefully thought-out models. The mathematics of the theory of singularities is the tool on which CT is based. We have therefore been confronted with a dilemma: either take the mathematics for granted, which would have made the paper accessible only to mathematicians and, in fact, only to a small minority of them, or explain it, which would have enormously increased the length of the paper. We chose a middle-of-the road solution. We explain some simple things, such as the cusp surface, rather carefully, with the hope that at least that much will be accessible to everybody. Other more complicated ideas are explained more briefly, and the reader who so wishes may skip those parts. Some important ideas are not discussed at all. One example of this is the butterfly catastrophe, which has played a role in some proposed applications. We found that the number of applications in which it appears is relatively so small, and a description of the butterfly would have to be so long, that no significant gain would have resulted from such an undertaking. A much more important omission is the idea of structural stability, and Ren? Thorn's theory of morphogenesis. To describe this theory, and analyze its flaws, would have doubled the length of the paper. We are, however, preparing an article which will deal extensively with Thorn's theory. Our decision not to discuss it here was made for the reason mentioned earlier, plus the fact that, inasmuch as Catastrophe Theory has acquired popularity, it is mostly through the articles of E.C. Zeeman and his coworkers, which makes it necessary to discuss this version of the theory first. Moreover, it is Zeeman's theory that poses the most immediate danger. By discussing things such as prison disturbances, and actually claiming that, on the basis of their theory, they can show mathematically that certain ways of handling riots are better, the Catastrophists are creating the possibility that their advice might be followed by those who do not understand the mathematics, and are therefore unable to perceive that it is being misused. The structure of the paper is as follows. Part I begins by describing the cusp surface and then explaining, by means of a simple example, how it is supposed to be of help in modelling a psychological phenomenon, animal</page><page sequence="4">120 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER aggression. The animal aggression model is then examined, and it is shown that it bears little or no relationship to reality. Part II discusses one aspect of the mathematical reasons why the cusp surface is supposed to be important: Thorn's theorem (for one and two controls) is stated. It is then shown that the derivation of the cusp from Thorn's theorem - the main feature of most ACT models, and the only one which is mathematically nontrivial ? is invalid. Furthermore, we show that Thorn's theorem can never give information that is useful on a practical level (cf. Section 7.1). In Part III, we give a detailed analysis of Zeeman's nerve impulse models, and both criticisms made before are found to apply: the reasoning leading to the model is wrong, and the conclusions disagree violently with the experimental evidence. Moreover, the nerve impulse models can be compared with an existing mathematical theory that describes the same phenomenon, the famous work of Hodgkin and Huxley. It is found that the Hodgkin Huxley theory has much more explanatory power and agrees better with the data. This belies one of the standard tenets of the Catastrophists: their claim that no mathematical theory existed before for the kind of phenomena that can be handled by Catastrophe Theory (cf. also Section 13). Part IV discusses another basic mathematical idea of CT, the concept of genericity. The misuse of this concept is illustrated with a discussion of Zeeman's paper on primary and secondary waves in developmental biology. The main theorem of the paper is stated, its 'proof is described and analyzed, and it is found to be flawed in a substantially large number of ways. Part V concludes the paper and presents several miscellaneous topics: the misleading distinction between 'quantitative' and 'qualitative' in the work of the catastrophists; the underlying continuous nature of the models, which artificially introduces continuity into phenomena where no such continuity is present; some possible reasons for the popularity of CT, and others. PARTI. HOW CATASTROPHE THEORY DESCRIBES DISCONTINUITY 2. THE CUSP CATASTROPHE Most ACT models in the social sciences are based on the use of the Cusp Catastrophe. In this section, we describe this surface, as well as some of the terminology associated with it.</page><page sequence="5">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 121 We consider a phenomenon in which three numerical variables x, y and z are involved, and we draw Cartesian axes in the customary way, so that triples of values of x, y, z are represented as points in three-dimensional space. Let us think of a situation in which the variables x,y play the role of 'external parameters', and z is a 'behavior variable' whose value is somehow determined by the values of x and y. Following Zeeman, we make this distinction apparent by referring to x and y as the control variables, and to z as the state variable, or the behavior variable. The simplest way of formalizing what we mean by the assertion that 'z is somehow determined by x and y* would be to assume that z is a function of x and y, i.e. that those triples (x,y,z) of points that actually represent possible behavior must satisfy an equation z=f(x,y). The behavior points would then be those points that lie on the graph of the function /, i.e. on the surface S shown in Figure 1. The behavior set is, in this case, a two-dimensional surface. Moreover, it is a surface of a very special kind, namely, one with the property that every vertical line intersects it exactly once (i.e. it is the graph of a function). One may allow for behavior sets that are more complicated than graphs of functions. For instance, the behavior set need not be a surface at all or, if it is one, it need not be a graph of a function. A simple example of a surface which is not a graph is shown in Figure 2. Any surface with the shape shown in Figure 2 will be referred to as a 'cusp surface7 (cf. Section 5 for more details). The basic features of such a surface are: (I) There is a region R in the plane of the control variables x, y, with the property that a vertical line through (x, y) intersects the surface once if(x, y) is outside R, and three times if(x, y) is inside R. (II) The region R is bounded by a curve B, which is made of two branches emerging from a point C, and tangent to each other at C. The point C is the cusp point. We refer to B as the bifurcation curve, to the portion of the (x,y) plane which is outside R as the region ofunimodal behavior, and to R as the region of bimodal behavior. (Note: the reader may wonder why R is not called the region of trimodal behavior since, for (x, y) in R, there are three possible values of z. The reason is that, in Zeeman's models,</page><page sequence="6">122 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER z=f(x,y) Fig. 1. A surface which is the graph of a function of two variables. the middle sheet of the cusp surface does not represent observable behavior, as will be explained later). In the cusp catastrophe models, it is assumed that: (D) As x and y vary continuously, then z will always be such that the point (x,y, z) belongs to the cusp surface. Moreover, z will vary continuously as long as possible. When continuous variation ofz is not possible, then z will jump. From now on, Assumption (D) will be referred to as the Delay Rule. We illustrate the kind of behavior that arises from the Delay Rule by considering what happens if the control parameters vary in such a way that the control point (x,y) moves from P0 to Px along the path shown in Figure 3. Initially,</page><page sequence="7">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 123 Fig. 2. A cusp surface. R is the region of bimodal behavior. B is the bifurcation curve. C is the cusp point. there is no doubt as to the possible value of z, since P0 is hi tne region of unimodal behavior. This is true until point / is reached. In particular, it is clear that z will vary continuously as the control point moves from P0 to /. What happens as we move from / to K? Here the indeterminacy of z is removed by the Delay Rule, which tells us that z will not jump at /, since it is possible for it to go on varying continuously. It follows that the behavior</page><page sequence="8">124 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Fig. 3. As the control point moves from P0 to Pl along a path in the xy plane, the behavior point describes the path from P? to P[ in the cusp surface. Behavior is discontinuous at point K. point (x,y,z) will remain in the lower sheet of the surface S, until the control point reaches K. When this happens, there is no way for z to remain continuous, so a jump necessarily occurs. In the various models, the sense in which the cusp surface represents behavior may vary. Here are some possibilities: (1) The surface S is the set of all possible behavior points. The behavior point is assumed to lie in S, but no additional constraints are postulated.</page><page sequence="9">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 125 (2) The cusp surface is the surface of most probable behavior i.e. it is assumed that, for each (x,y), the values of z can vary, but that they are distributed according to a probability density PXf y(z). Then S is the locus of the points of maximum probability. (3) The cusp surface is an attractor, i.e. it is assumed that the behavior is described by a dynamical system in three-dimensional space. This system involves, primarily, a 'fast' dynamic which pulls a given point (x,y, z) quickly Fig. 4.</page><page sequence="10">126 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER towards S in a vertical direction, where the 'slow' dynamic then takes over, and moves the behavior point within 5 in a deterministic fashion (cf. Section 8). In addition to one of these alternatives, there are extra postulates that may be imposed. For instance, the assumption that the behavior point belongs to S may be supplemented by postulating that the motion within S is governed by a vector field, or it may be assumed that random noise is present. However, these extra features do not alter the basic nature of the models and we shall for the most part ignore them. The most important aspect of the Cusp Catastrophe models is the qualitative behavior that arises from them. We have already described one aspect of this behavior, by showing what happens when the control point moves along the path from P0 to Px in Figure 3. We showed, in particular, how discontinuous behavior occurs. Another important aspect of the cusp catastrophe models is the phenomenon o? divergence. To illustrate this, let us compare the two paths shown in Figure 4. Though these paths are very close, the resulting behaviors are quite different. For Path 1, the behavior point moves continuously and, therefore, it eventually stays in the lower sheet of S. For Path 2, the behavior point will move into the upper sheet of S. Hence the value of z at P2 will be much larger than the value at Pi, even though Pi and P2 are close. 3. ANIMAL. AGGRESSION: AN EXAMPLE OF A CUSP-CATASTROPHE MODEL We now give a detailed description of a model for animal aggression proposed by Zeeman (1971a; 1973a; 1974a; and 1976a). We begin by quoting from Zeeman's paper to the 1974 International Congress of Mathematicians. In p. 535 Zeeman writes (the remarks in square brackets are ours): According to Konrad Lorenz, fear and rage are conflicting drives influencing aggression. Here the two extreme behavior modes are attack/flight, and x [i.e. the behavior variable] represents a 1-dimensional spectrum of behavior varying from neutral to the two extremes at either end. The cause c [i.e. the control parameter] is 2-dimensional representing the strengths of the fear and rage drives present in the animal at that moment. Lorenz observes that in the case of dogs the coordinates of fear and rage can be read from the facial expression. Rage only causes attack, fear only causes flight, and when both are present the effect is one of two extremes but unpredictable. Therefore</page><page sequence="11">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 127 Fig. 5. (Fig. 1 of Zeeman 1974a.) the probability goes bimodal, and as a first approximation we might expect our cloud of points to cluster around a cause-effect graph equivalent to the cusp-catastrophe as shown in Figure 1 [our Figure 5 ]. In p. 537 of (1974a), Zeeman continues his discussion of the aggression model. He shows how various paths in the control space may lead to different kinds of behavior. Tor example in Figure 1 [our Figure 5 ] the path Px, representing increasing rage at a fixed level of fear, as for instance in a cornered dog, will lead to a sudden attack at cx while path Pt to a sudden disengagement at c2 [sic]. Meanwhile pathsPS,P4 illustrate how nearby paths can lead to divergent behavior. Similarly humans, when made angry and frightened, are unpredictable and are denied access to rational behavior, and may jump from abuse to apology, from hysteria to tears.</page><page sequence="12">128 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Zeeman then proceeds to explain that the model may apply under fairly general circumstances (p. 538): The interest of this example is that it may provide a general model for control of aggression, valid for different species under varying circumstances, and may give insights into how such controls developed and have evolved. In his Scientific American article, (1976a), Zeeman describes the same model in much more detailed fashion. He begins by referring, again, to Konrad Lorenz, who "has pointed out that aggressive behavior is influenced by two conflicting drives, rage and fear", and "has proposed that, in the dog, these factors can be measured with some reliability. A dog's rage is correlated with the degree to which its mouth is open or its teeth are bared; its fear is reflected by how much its ears are flattened back." Zeeman then analyzes how these two factors, rage and fear, influence behavior: If only one of the conflicting emotional factors is present, the response of the dog is relatively easy to predict. If the dog is enraged but not afraid, then some aggressive action, such as attacking, can be expected. When the dog is frightened but is not provoked to anger, aggression becomes improbable and the dog will most likely flee. Prediction is also straightforward if neither stimulus is present, then the dog is likely to express some neutral kind of behavior unrelated to either aggression or submission. Having asserted that the behavior is easy to predict when "only one factor is present", Zeeman then discusses what happens when both factors are present simultaneously. When this happens: The two controlling factors are in direct conflict. Simple models that cannot accommodate discontinuity might predict that the two stimuli would cancel each other, leading again to neutral behavior. That prediction merely reveals the shortcomings of such simplistic models, since neutrality is in fact the least likely behavior. When a dog is both angry and frightened, the probabilities of both extreme modes of behavior are high, the dog may attack or it may flee, but it will not remain indifferent. It is the strength of the model derived from catastrophe theory that it can account for this bimodal distribution of probabilities. Moreover, the model provides a basis for predicting, under particular circumstances, which behavior the dog will choose. Zeeman then describes how the model is constructed. The two 'control parameters', rage and fear, are plotted in the horizontal plane.</page><page sequence="13">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 129 The behavior of the dog is then measured on a third axis, the behavior axis, which is perpendicular to the first two. We might assume that there is a smooth continuum of possible modes of behavior ranging, for example, from outright retreat through cowering, avoidance, neutrality, growling and snarling to attacking. The most aggressive modes of behavior are assigned the largest values on the behavior axis, the least aggressive the smallest values. Zeeman then explains that, for each point on the control plane, there will be at least one corresponding behavior point and that for many points ? when one of the two factors is clearly dominant ? the behavior point will be unique. However, for those points "where rage and fear are roughly equal", each point in the control plane has two behavior points, one at a large value of the behavior axis representing aggressive action, the other at a small value representing submissive action. In addition, we can note a third point that will always fall between these two, representing the least likely neutral behavior. We are then told that, if the behavior points for the entire control surface are plotted and then connected, they form a smooth surface: the behavior surface. The surface has an overall slope from high values where rage predominates to low values in the region where fear is the prevailing state of mind, but the slope is not its most distinctive feature. Catastrophe theory reveals that in the middle of the surface there must be a smooth double fold, creating a pleat without creases, which grows narrower from the front of the surface to the back and eventually disappears in a singular point where the three sheets of the pleat come together. It is the pleat that gives the model its most interesting characteristics. All the points on the behavior surface represent the most probable behavior of the dog, with the exception of those on the middle sheet, which represent least probable behavior. Through catastrophe theory we can deduce the shape of the entire surface from the fact that the behavior is bimodal for some control points. Zeeman then explains "how the model predicts behavior". The explana tion follows the same lines as the one given in the paper for the International Congress of Mathematicians, i.e. several paths in the control plane are described, together with the corresponding behavior. The only difference between the two articles is that, in the one we are now considering, extra color is added by the use of familiar terms and a somewhat more impressionistic language. For instance, here is how Zeeman presents the effect of a gradual</page><page sequence="14">130 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER increase in fear, while the rage is kept constant (i.e. of path P2 in Figure 5). At first, the dog remains aggressive. As fear continues to increase, however, the behavior point must eventually reach the edge of the pleat. The novel and illuminating properties of the model then become evident. At the edge of the pleat the sheet on which the behavior point has been traveling folds under and is thereby effectively annihilated; with any additional increase in fear the sheet vanishes. The behavior state must therefore fall directly to the bottom sheet of the graph, which represents quite different modes of behavior. The aggressive states of the top sheet are no longer possible; there is no alternative but a sudden, and indeed catastrophic, change to a meeker attitude. The model thus predicts that if an enraged dog is made progressively more fearful, it will eventually break off its attack and retreat. The change in behavior might be called a flight catastrophe. Zeeman then describes, in similar terms, the effect of progressively increasing rage while fear is kept constant (i.e. Path Pi of Figure 5), and concludes that "a frightened dog, if it is placed in a situation in which rage steadily increases, may suddenly attack". Finally, Zeeman shows how the phenomenon of 'divergence' occurs in the model. This is done by describing the behavior that arises from paths P3 and P4 of Figure 5. This concludes Zeeman's description of the model and of its contribution to our understanding of aggression. 4. ANALYSIS OF THE AGGRESSION MODEL 4.1. Approaches to the Model In our experience, readers of Zeeman's presentation of the CT aggression model described in the preceding section ? lay people and specialists alike ? react to it in very disparate ways. Before we can analyze the model we must carefully consider these different viewpoints. Broadly speaking, we can distinguish five (overlapping) types of reaction. Perhaps the reader's is one of them. These reactions are: (Bl) The belief that what has been described above must be a brief, nontechnical summary of the model The 'real' model, presumably, exists somewhere else. It probably takes the form of a long paper in some psychology journal, in which a large number of observations of various kinds of aggressive behavior are analyzed, the data plotted in three-dimensional space, and the cusp surface is found to fit these data reasonably well.</page><page sequence="15">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 131 Moreover, that longer paper presumably gives the detailed mathematical theory whose existence is implied, but not asserted, by Zeeman's remarks (e.g. his statements that "through Catastrophe Theory we can deduce the shape of the entire surface from the fact that the behavior is bimodal for some control points", that the model can "account for this bimodal distribution of probabilities" and, especially, that "Catastrophe Theory reveals that in the middle of the surface there must be a smooth double fold, creating a pleat without creases,..."). (B2) The belief that this 'aggression model' is probably not meant to be taken seriously, and that it is only presented as a simple illustration of the geometry of the cusp surface, rather than as a genuine theory of animal aggression. (B3) The belief that this model is probably not a good representative of the 'applications of Catastrophe Theory to the social sciences'. Holders of this belief are likely to think, at this point, that we are being unfair to Catastrophe Theory by using this particular model to illustrate how, it is applied. The "real, solid applications" are, presumably, of a different nature, and the critics ought to have chosen one of them, rather than the aggression model, to show Catastrophe Theory at work. (B4) The belief that this model actually seems to account for some aspects of animal aggression. It seems to explain a puzzling phenomenon ? the discontinuity exhibited by animal aggressive behavior. (B5) The belief, most likely to be held by mathematicians, that, even if the model is somewhat unsatisfactory on some counts, it is still better than what existed before. Another version of this belief, approximately equivalent to the first statement, is that nothing really scientific had been said about animal aggression anyhow and that Zeeman's aggression model, whatever its flaws, is at least a step in the right direction, since it represents a first serious attempt to develop a scientific theory of the phenomenon. We will now show that all five of these beliefs are false. To begin with, what has been presented here is as good a description of the model as is available anywhere in the scientific literature. What Zeeman says about animal aggression in Scientific American is not a "summary of the real model"; it is the real model. There is no paper where data are shown which provide evidence for the model. As for the mathematical reasoning, there is none, at least for this model. In other models of a similar nature, Zeeman</page><page sequence="16">132 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER actually does describe an argument which, he claims, makes it possible to deduce the cusp surface from simple assumptions by means of some deep mathematics. We will discuss this reasoning when we analyze such models, and we will show that it is not valid (cf. Section 7). For the aggression model, Zeeman does not state his reasoning explicitly. It must be presumed that his argument is probably the same as for the other models and, consequently, invalid as well. So belief Bl is false. As for belief B2, let us keep in mind the fact that Zeeman uses this model as his first illustration of the uses of Catastrophe Theory in his paper for the 1974 International Congress of Mathematicians. Moreover, he asserts in that paper, that "the cusp catastrophe can ... provide an explicit model, which for individual animals might be made quantitative and predictive" and, later on, that this "may provide a general model for control of aggression, valid for different species under varying circumstances, and may give insight into how such controls develop and have evolved". These are serious claims, expressed at an important international scientific forum. It is hard to accept the belief that Zeeman is only playing some kind of game. It is much more reasonable to take Zeeman's word literally, and to assume that he means what he says. We must therefore conclude that belief 2 is false, and that the model is meant in all seriousness. Belief 3 is also false. The dog aggression model is quite representative of the kind of speculation that is involved in the use of Catastrophe Theory in the social sciences.2 It is true that some of the other proposed social science applications involve some additional structure, but the difference is not substantial. The only reasons why we chose to use the animal aggression model to start our analysis are (a) that the model is quite easy to explain, (b) that it can be used to present, in a concrete example, criticisms which are valid in general and (c) that Zeeman also uses this model, in two of his most important papers, as his first example. Belief B5 will be examined later. In Section 13, we will show that Zeeman's dog aggression model is inferior to the simplest model that can be produced using thresholds. We are left with belief B4: that the model actually seems to account for some aspects of animal aggression. We shall now attempt tc determine whether (a) the model improves our understanding of aggressive behavior by making correct, nontrivial testable predictions, or whether, at least (b) the model accounts for a reasonable collection of already known facts.</page><page sequence="17">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 133 As for item (a), the answer is clearly 'no'. No such predictions are stated by Zeeman, nor are any experiments proposed that might validate the model. There remains, however, the possibility that the model may deserve a favorable judgement according to the less stringent condition (b). So, let us ask what facts about animal aggression are accounted for by the model. Zeeman's description of what can be done with the model seems to include only two such 'facts', namely (i) the existence of'catastrophes' of attack and withdrawal (as exemplified by paths Px and P2 of Figure 5), and (ii) the phenomenon of 'divergence'. Before we embark upon a discussion of how Zeeman's model accounts for these facts it has to be pointed out that, for the second 'fact', it is not even clear whether or not it truly is a fact. In the absence of experimental evidence for the 'divergence' phenomenon, it is hard to see why the fact that Catastrophe Theory accounts for it ? if it does ? should be regarded as a point in favor of the model. We now face the fundamental question, namely, whether Zeeman's model accounts for, or provides any insights into the discontinuities that are clearly present in the observed behavior of dogs. Now, what appears in the model is a certain mathematical phenomenon: a discontinuity of a function. If we are going to assert that the model 'accounts' for the observed discontinuities of dog behavior, it is necessary - but by no means sufficient - that this mathematical phenomenon exhibit a reasonable degree of similarity to the real one. The fact that in both cases there is a discontinuity is not sufficient, otherwise any discontinuous mathematical function / whatsoever could be said to 'account' for any natural phenomenon whatsoever in which discontinuity is present. Moreover, it does not suffice to require that there exist a significant similarity between the mathematical phenomenon that occurs in the model and the real phenomenon that the model is supposed to account for. At least one other condition must be satisfied, namely, nontriviality. The mathematical phenomenon must be shown to follow from the assumptions of the model in a nontrivial way, and it cannot just be a part of the assumptions. To see why this is a fundamental point, imagine a 'theory' of stock-market crashes in which it is postulated that the stock price index is a function of time which is continuous, except for some jumps. If such a 'theory' were presented, and the claim were made that it accounts for stock-market crashes, the claim would have to be rejected. What the 'theory' does is, at best, restate the fact that there are crashes, not account for it. The</page><page sequence="18">134 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER fact that sudden jumps occur is a part of the assumptions, so that the theory's 'account' of these jumps is, simply, that 'there are jumps because there are jumps', which is hardly a contribution to our understanding. Contrast this, for instance, with Newton's theory of gravitation. The theory certainly accounts for the three empirically derived Kepler laws, in that the laws follow, by mathematical reasoning, from the postulate of a gravitational force inversely proportional to the square of the distance. That the ellipticity of planetary orbits can actually be derived from this postulate is far from immediately obvious.3 It is precisely because the Newtonian postulate seems at first sight to be unrelated to the ellipticity of the orbits that, when the relation is shown to exist, we conclude that the theory explains why orbits are elliptic. On the other hand, if there were a theory in which it is postulated that planetary orbits are ellipses, such a theory could not be said to account for the ellipticity of the orbits, since this fact is merely restated as a postulate of the theory. Summarizing the preceding discussion, we must find out: (I) if the discontinuity that appears in the model resembles the behavioral discontinuity in a significant way, and (II) if the model actually accounts for it or merely postulates it. We now discuss the answers to these questions. 4.2. The Meaning of'Attack' In the model, there is a behavior variable x. Zeeman says that an 'attack catastrophe' occurs when, as a result of a crossing of the bifurcation curve, the value of x jumps upwards. Similarly, a downwards jump of x is described as a 'withdrawal catastrophe'. What does* represent? According to Zeeman's description ? quoted before ? "the behavior of the dog is ... measured on a third axis, the behavior axis, which is perpendicular to the first two. We might assume that there is a smooth continuum of possible modes of behavior ranging, for example, from outright retreat through cowering, avoidance, neutrality, growling and snarling to attacking. The most aggressive modes of behavior are assigned the largest values on the behavior axis, the least aggressive the smallest values". So, the value of x measures how aggressively the dog is behaving. In particular, a very large value ofx represents attacking behavior. On the other hand, an 'attack catastrophe' is an upward jump of the value of x. So, it seems that we must distinguish between two kinds of</page><page sequence="19">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 135 Fig. 6. attacks, namely: (a) attacking behavior, which is represented in the model by a high value of the variable x, and (b) attack catastrophes, represented by jumps in the value of x. In particular, it is perfectly possible, in the 'model', for an 'attack' in the first sense to take place without there being an 'attack catastrophe'. That is, it is possible to reach a high value of x in a continuous way, without jumps. Indeed, consider the behavior that arises when the control parameters are varied along path Q of Figure 6. We start at a very low level of fear and rage, and we progressively enrage the dog while the fear is kept constant. The resulting behavior is, simply, that x increases con tinuously. By sufficiently increasing the rage, we can attain very high values of x. What does this mean? If we interpret the word 'attack' in the first of the two possible ways mentioned above, then we must conclude that there is an attack, but not a discontinuity in behavior. If we interpret it in the second way, then the conclusion is that there is no attack. Which interpretation is</page><page sequence="20">136 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER correct? Zeeman does not tell. Consequently, we do not know whether or not Zeeman's model predicts an attack in this case. It seems most likely to us that Zeeman has the second interpretation in mind, as shown by his assertion that the model predicts that "a frightened dog, if it is placed in a situation in which rage steadily increases, may suddenly attack". This statement is made as a description of the behavior that results from path Px of Figure 5. Therefore, it seems that the 'sudden attack' is the jump that occurs when crossing the bifurcation curve, and the dog must be frightened for an attack to occur. If this is so, the implication would be that, when a dog is 'placed in a situation in which rage steadily increases' then, if the dog is not frightened, it will not attack. We prefer, however, not to draw this conclusion, and to leave the question open. The reason is that Zeeman's statement also lends itself to a different interpretation: it is possible that Zeeman meant the emphasis to be put on the words 'frightened' and 'suddenly', in which case what he means could be rendered as follows: "if a dog is progressively enraged, while keeping a constant level of fear, it will eventually attack. If the fear level is high the attack will be sudden but, if the level is low, the attack will be gradual". This rendering of Zeeman's statement would be consistent with interpretation (a) of the use of the word 'attack'. The discussion that will follow does not depend on which interpretation is chosen, and therefore no choice will be made. It must be pointed out, however, that the mere fact that such an ambiguity is present already suffices to justify serious doubts about the model. Indeed, the main claim of this model is that it accounts for 'attacks' and 'withdrawals'. The least that can be required of a mathematical 'model' that purports to account for a fact F is that there be a clearly specified proposition P in the model which clearly asserts the truth of F, when the abstract terms of the model are 'interpreted' (e.g. when the numerical value x is interpreted as 'aggression'), and that P be true in the model. In the aggression model, we see that it is not even clear what P should be, if F is the fact that dogs' aggressive behavior exhibits discontinuity. But there is an even more serious objection. Attacks by animals are clearly discontinuous, 'yes or no' phenomena. A snake will stay still while an animal is approaching, it may hesitate and not know whether or not to attack, but when it does it, it does it all the way. A dog, if made progressively angrier, may grow tenser, it may growl and threaten, but there is a clear, unequivocal</page><page sequence="21">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 137 distinction between the behavior of a dog which is standing still, and one that is attacking. There is no continuity in the behavior of a dog which stands still until, suddenly, it jumps at a man, or at another dog. There may be an underlying continuous dispositional variable ? the dog's 'willingness to attack', or the anger, or the probability of an attack - but the behavioral variable ? i.e. 'jump vs. no jump', 'attack vs. no attack' ? exhibits a real dichotomy. There are no intermediate stages. Half-attacks, or attacks of size 1/4 do not seem to exist. In fact, the concept of a 'semi-attack' by a dog, or of a snake gradually attacking a person, is utterly meaningless. Everybody is aware of these facts, and it is probably for this reason that Zeeman's aggression model, which seems to exhibit the same dichotomy, may produce a somewhat favorable initial impression. However, in Zeeman's model there really is no discontinuity that corresponds to the one that we all know from direct observation. It is easy to see that this is the case whether we assume interpretation (a) or (b) of the use of the word 'attack'. Indeed, let us first assume (a), i.e. that an attack is represented by a high value of x. If this is the case, then x is a continuous variable, and it is not clear at all how the 'attack?no attack' dichotomy arises. Zeeman's words are clear, and deserve to be quoted once again: "we may assume that there is a smooth continuum of possible modes of behavior ranging, for example, from outright retreat through cowering, avoidance, neutrality, growling and snarling to attacking'. Exactly what are the 'modes of behavior' in the last part of the 'smooth continuum', i.e. from 'snarling' to 'attacking'? The reader should try to imagine a continuous progression from snarling to attacking as would result when following path Q of Figure 6. He will fail. No matter how good his imagination is, the progression will be discontinuous: there will be one instant when the dog jumps. The existence of such an instant establishes a clear dichotomy between attacking behavior, and any behavior which does not involve an attack. (The reader may object that he can imagine a dog becoming progressively tenser, and readier to attack, in a continuous fashion. But this would only establish the existence of an underlying continuous dispositional variable. The fact would still remain that the overt behavior is clearly discontinuous). This is the discontinuity that we think about when we assert that animal aggressive behavior is discontinuous. It is because Zeeman's words create the impression that his model explains it, that some may react</page><page sequence="22">138 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER favorably to it. But, as we have seen, Zeeman's model not only fails to account for the behavioral discontinuity, it actually postulates its non existence, at least if we use interpretation (a). Do things become better if, instead, we assume interpretation (b), i.e. that an 'attack' is an upward jump in the value of x? It is difficult to resist the belief that, this time, we have at least achieved an appropriate mathematical description of one aspect of the 'attack' phenomenon. At least, we now have a genuine discontinuity in the model! However, we must proceed with caution, and be wary of first impressions derived from superficial analogies. A function that jumps is not the same as a dog that jumps. A discontinuous function cannot be said to explain discontinuous behavior merely because it is discontinuous. So we must ask whether the discontinuity of the model resembles the real discontinuity in a significant way. In the model, it is possible to draw paths in the control plane that cross the bifurcation curve at any desired point. In particular, the magnitude of the jump that will take place when the crossing occurs is a continuous quantity. If we adopt interpretation (b), we must conclude that, for a given dog, there is a continuum of possible 'attacks' and, in particular, that there are 'attacks of size e' for any sufficiently small e, since we can always enrage a dog while keeping a constant level /of fear, and we can choose/so that the crossing of the bifurcation curve will take place as close to the cusp point as desired. Therefore, the model incorporates a continuum of possible 'attack sizes' Ax, all the way down to Ax = 0. Now, what are these attacks of small size? Is every jump of x by a positive amount an 'attack', even if the size of the jump is very small? Or, perhaps, only a reasonably large jump is an attack? Zeeman does not tell us, but his answer can be inferred from his discussion of another model of his, in which the same problem arises. In his paper on stock exchanges [1974b], Zeeman uses the cusp catastrophe in a fashion which is quite similar to the 'aggression model'. The vertical variable in the stock exchanges model is the rate of change / of the stock price index. When the control path crosses the appropriate branch of the bifurcation curve,/jumps to a lower value. Zeeman resists the obvious temptation of identifying this jump with a crash, and he does so for a good reason, namely, that a very small jump in / would certainly not be thought of by anybody as a crash. So, instead, Zeeman writes: "If BBf [i.e. the jump] is very large, causing a very steep descent, then we are liable to call the recession a crash".</page><page sequence="23">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 139 The difficulty described above is not specific to the stock exchange model. The same problem arises in any cusp catastrophe model in which an observed dichotomy is 'accounted for' by reducing it to a crossing of the bifurcation curve. Returning now to the 'animal aggression model', we see no alternative but to assume that Zeeman means to call a jump an 'attack' if it is large enough. But then, how large does the jump have to be? And, if indeed there is a continuum of possible jumps, how does one explain the clear discontinuity that we seem to perceive? If we are liable to call a large jump an 'attack', what name do we give to small and medium size jumps? No such names seem to exist, for the very simple reason that the behavior they might describe does not exist. The dichotomy 'attack?no attack' is a very distinct one, the two possibilities are clearly differentiated, and no intermediate types of behavior seem to occur. Dichotomies (e.g. 'attack?no attack', 'large?small') are very common in our language. It is clear that there is a distinction between two kinds of dichotomies: the objective and the subjective ones. An objective dichotomy is one that is 'in the things themselves'. For instance, the male?female dichotomy (for, say, human beings) is objective, in that (except for some very rare cases) every member of the human species is either one or the other, and there is no continuous spectrum of intermediate sexes. A subjective dichotomy is one which is in our way of describing things, rather than in the things themselves. An example of this is the large?small dichotomy. Apples come in all sizes, but we use the words 'large' and 'small' to describe those sizes. The presence of a subjective dichotomy is easy to recognize: if the actual reality is continuous, then the use of dichotomous language is insufficient to describe it, and new expressions are naturally created in order to make it pQSsible to give a more accurate description. For instance, the large?small dichotomy is supplemented in our language by a variety of expressions that increase the precision of our description of sizes (e.g. medium size, very large, moderately large, etc.). On the other hand, an objective dichotomy such as 'alive?dead' is not accompanied by such a collection of expressions. One does not talk about a person being 'dead but not too much', for instance. (Expressions such as 'half-dead' or 'very much alive' are of course purely figurative.) We can now begin to see that Zeeman's 'aggression model' does make a nontrivial statement about the discontinuity that is present in animal</page><page sequence="24">140 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER aggressive behavior: it asserts that the attack-non attack dichotomy is subjective, rather than objective, i.e. that the neat distinction that we believed to exist between the two types of behavior is really in our minds, not in the behavior itself. This is true whether we accept interpretation (a) or (b) of the word 'attack' for, in either case, the 'attacking behavior' is embedded in a continuum of possible behaviors, and nothing is said to explain why it seems to be so neatly different from other types of behavior. If Zeeman's theory indeed asserts that the attack-no attack dichotomy is subjective ? and we see no way to escape the conclusion that it does ? then this invalidates the theory for at least two reasons, each of which, all by itself, would suffice. First, because it is patently false that the attack?no attack dichotomy is subjective. As we have already pointed out before, the distinction between the two kinds of behavior is clearly there, it is hard to imagine what an intermediate behavior would be like, and no words seem to exist to describe it. Moreover, there is a good scientific reason why this is an objective dichotomy. An animal that had, as one of its possible modes of behavior, a 'half-attack' (e.g. a tiger slowly jumping at a deer, or jumping but only scratching the deer's skin with his claws) would loose out in competition with other members of his species. 'Half-attacks' are not very efficient for survival, and therefore the theory of natural selection explains why snakes, tigers and dogs do not exhibit a continuum of possible behavior modes. A second reason which also suffices to invalidate the model is that, if it is true that the attack?no attack dichotomy is subjective, then the model, rather than explain the discontinuity, merely shifts it. If the discontinuity is really in our minds, then why is it there? What needs to be explained now is why we seem to distinguish so clearly between two types of behavior. And Zeeman's model does not give such an explanation. Let us summarize our conclusions: (I) The only predictions that Zeeman states for his model are (a) that a frightened dog, if angered, may attack (and, if the cause of the anger is removed, may withdraw) and (b) that divergence may occur. Prediction (a) is trivial, and for (b) no evidence as to its validity is provided. (II) There is a basic ambiguity in the model, since the word 'attack' is given at least two different meanings. However, no matter which of the two meanings is adopted we find that, in the model, the discontinuity of the attack vanishes, and the attack is now embedded in a continuous family of</page><page sequence="25">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 141 behaviors. The model does nothing to account for the fact that a genuine discontinuity occurs, both in the actual behavior and in our description of it. (Ill) If we interpret 'attack' to mean a crossing of the bifurcation curve, then the model makes a testable prediction: a dog which is not frightened will not attack, no matter how enraged. This prediction is plainly false. If, on the other hand, it is assumed that an attack is a high value of the behavior variable, then the model's prediction is no longer false, but unintelligible: a dog which is not frightened will attack if enraged, but the 'attack' will be gradual, and there will be no breaking point at which the qualitative nature of the dog's behavior changes drastically. These conclusions clearly show that there is little in common between what happens in the model and what happens in reality, except for the fact that in both cases there are discontinuities. The mystery that confronts us now is: why the cusp surface? If the cusp surface does not agree with actual behavior, why introduce it? According to the catastrophists, one is inevitably led to the cusp surface for certain deep mathematical reasons. To them we turn now. PART II THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS: THOM'S THEOREM 5. THOM'S THEOREM The behavior of many physical, chemical, biological or social systems can be described by means of equilibrium conditions. It is assumed that the state of the system can be characterized by the values of certain real variables Xi,... , x?, called the 'state variables', or 'internal variables'. Moreover, it is assumed that the values of the variables must satisfy a set of equilibrium equations: (EQ) ei(xi9...,xn) = 0 e2(xu...,xn) = 0 em(xi,...,xn) = 0</page><page sequence="26">142 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER As an example, consider an economy with n commodities, labelled 1,..., ru Let x/ denote the price of the /-th commodity. The demand and supply of each commodity are functions of the prices of all the commodities. Let e?(xi,..., xn) be the excess demand (i.e. demand minus supply) of the z-th commodity when the prices are Xi,..., xn. Then (EQ) are the equations of equilibrium of supply and demand. (In this case, m = n) If we just 'count equations and unknowns', it is clear that the system (EQ) is likely to be overdetermined if m &gt; n, and underdetermined if m &lt; n. So, if m&gt;n,we should expect that, most of the time, (EQ) will have no solutions whereas, if m&lt;n, one can expect an n - m dimensional manifold of solutions. When m = n, one expects a discrete set of solutions. It is therefore reasonable to single out the case m = n as the most important one. If m &gt; n then m- n o? the equations must be redundant, or else there is no behavior. If m &lt; n then the behavior is undetermined, suggesting that we need more equations. So, from now on, we shall only consider systems (EQ) with m = n. The fact that m = n does not rigorously imply that the set of solutions of (EQ) is discrete, unless further restrictions are satisfied. One such restriction is nondegeneracy: consider a system (EQ) in which m = n and the functions ei,..., en have continuous partial derivatives. We call (EQ) nondegenerate if, at every point (x?,..., xj) which satisfies (EQ), we have For a nondegenerate system, the solutions of (EQ) form a discrete set. Now suppose that the functions ex,..., en also depend on some external parameters ai,...,&lt;xp. (For instance, in the supply-demand example, ai,..., OLp could be people's tastes, the government's fiscal policy, expectations about the future of the economy, political unrest, etc.). Then, for each value of a?9..., ap, the values of xt,...,xn 'are determined' by (EQ') ex(ai,..., ccp;xi,...,xn) = 0 e2(ot1,...,CLp;xi,...,xn) = 0 en(al9... tOpiXi,... ,xn) = 0</page><page sequence="27">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 143 So (EQ') 'determines' xx,. .. , x? as 'functions' of ax,_otp. The reason for the quotation marks is, naturally, that (EQ') need not have a unique solution: it may have none whatsoever, or it may have infinitely many. Let S denote the set of solutions al9... ,0ip;Xl,... ,xn of (EQ'). Then S is called the equilibrium surface even though, in 'pathological' cases, it may not be a surface. Since S is defined by n equations, one can expect S to be a p-dimensional manifold in the p + n dimensional space of the a's and the x's. Let us consider two examples of this, both with p = n = \. First, consider the equilibrium equation a - x = 0. In this case, of course, the equilibrium surface is the line x = a in the a, x plane (cf. Figure 7a). The equilibrium condition actually defines x as a function of a. Our second example is the equilibrium equation e(a, x) = a - x2 =0. Here the equilibrium surface is the parabola a = x2 in the a,x plane. The equilibrium condition does not determine x as a single-valued function of a since, for negative a, there is no x whatsoever, and for positive a there are two (cf. Figure 7b). Observe that, if a is a positive number, then there are two functions x+(a), x_(&lt;k), defined for a in an interval / containing ?, and having the property that the part Sj of S which consists of those points whose abscissa is in / is actually the union of the graphs of these two functions. Observe also that the reason why the functions x+ can be found is that be/bx =? 0 at the two points (?, ? y/?) where e = 0, and therefore the implicit function theorem can be used. If ? &gt; 0, then the most basic qualitative property of the solutions of e(a, x) = 0 ? their number ? remains unchanged for a in the neighborhood of ?. The same is true if ? &lt; 0. When ? = 0, however, we are witnessing a transition from one type of qualitative behavior to a radically different one. No solutions exist to the left of ? = 0, and two exist for a to the right of 0. This is a 'catastrophe'. Notice that, at the point (0,0), we have e = 0 and bejbx = 0. It is because be/bx = 0 that we cannot use the implicit function theorem to solve, in a neighborhood of ol = 0, for x as a function of a.</page><page sequence="28">H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S.

If (a?,... , otp;x?) = P is a point in the equilibrium set which is not a singular point, then be/bx = 0 at P, and therefore we can use the implicit function theorem and conclude that, in a neighborhood of P, the equilibrium surface S is the graph of a function x = x(u?i ,..., ap). The singular points are those points in the neighborhood of which the equilibrium equation fails to determine x as a function of a.x,..., ap.4 For systems with several state variables, we can define similarly the concepts of 'singular point' and 'catastrophe'. Consider the system (EQ') with n = m Assume that the functions ex,..., en are continuously differentiate. Then a point (a?,..., a?p ; x?,. .., xn) = P in the surface S is singular if det (!H at P.

The critical set is given by the equation x2 - a = 0. This set, and the corresponding catastrophe set, has been studied above (cf. Figure 7b). There is exactly one catastrophe point, namely, a = 0. For our second example consider the function x4 x2 /(?&gt;*) = J-2 ax. The equation of the critical set is x3 - x = a. This equation does not determine x as a function of a. However, it is very easy to draw the graph of the critical set, as shown in Figure 8. We can divide catastrophe point catastrophe point ^ +2/-}/r Fig. 8.</page><page sequence="31">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 147 the a axis into three parts: (i) the half-line -?&gt;&lt;&lt;*&lt;-(2/3\/3), 00 the segment - (2/3\/3) &lt; a &lt; (2/3\/3) and (iii) the half-line (2/3&gt;/3) &lt; a &lt; ?. For each a in the segment (~(2/3\/3), (2/3\/3)) there are f/zree solutions x of the equilibrium equation. Elsewhere, i.e. for a &lt; ? (2/3&gt;/3) or a &gt; (2/3\/3), the solution x is unique. The points a = ? (2/3\/3) are therefore the ones where a change takes place from one type of behavior to another. And, indeed, an easy computation shows that these are the catastrophe points in the sense of our definition. We now study the cusp catastrophe, in which two parameters a and ? are involved. We obtain it by considering the function5 ? x4 3?x2 /(a,?;x) = ?-ax. The equilibrium equation is bf/bx = 0, i.e.: (*) x3-30x = a. In order to study the solutions of (*), we consider separately the cases ? &lt; 0 and ? &gt; 0. For each fixed ?, we draw in the a, x plane the curve F? determined by (*). Let g?(x) denote the left side of (*). The derivative ofg? is dx If j3&lt;0 then this derivative is always positive, and g? is a steadily increasing function of x. We can thus sketch the graph ofg^x) = a (Figure 9). If ? &gt; 0 then (dg?/dx) is positive for - ?? &lt; x &lt; - y/?, then negative for ? y/?&lt;x&lt; y/?, then positive again for y/? &lt; x &lt; + ??. So g?(x) increases as x grows from ? ?? to ? y/?, then decreases as x grows from ? y/? to y/?, and then increases again. The values of g? for x = ? y/? and x = y/? are a = 2j33^2 and a = ? 203/2, respectively. Hence, the graph T? ofg?(x) = a has the shape depicted in Figure 9. The full picture of the critical set of/is obtained by putting together the curves T? for all ?. The result is a surface in three dimensional space, depicted in Figure 10. The reader will recognize it as the cusp surface described in Section 2. The catastrophe set is, in this case, a curve in the a, ? plane, called the bifurcation curve.

We must now discuss the concept of equivalence of singularities. Roughly speaking, we want to say that two singularities are equivalent if we can transform one into the other by means of a change of coordinates. However, we do not wish to allow for completely arbitrary changes of coordinates, since we want to preserve certain qualitative features. An admissible transformation of the coordinates ait... ,ap;xl9... ,xn to the coordinates a\,.. ., ap\x\,.. ., xn is a transformation of the form (A) oci =Ai(ai,...,ap) ap=hp(ai,...,ap) xi =*x(ai,.. .,ap,xx,.. .,xn) Xn = kn(&lt;*l &gt; - ,OLp,Xx,.. .,Xn)</page><page sequence="33">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 149 Fig. 10. for which the functions hi,..., hp, kx,..., kn are infinitely differentiable and which, in addition, has the property that the inverse of the trans formation also exists and is given by infinitely differentiable functions.

SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER If of Rp+n, with the property that, whenever ux EU is in the same fiber as u2 ? U, then it follows that Tux is in the same fiber as Tu2.) If S is a set of points ax,.. ., ap, Xi,. .., xn in p + ?-dimensional space, then an admissible transformation maps S into a set S' of points &lt;*i,... , ap,x\,... , xn. We call two equilibrium sets S, S* equivalent if Sf can be obtained from S by means of an admissible transformation. There is a corresponding local concept. If s, s' are points of S, S', we say that S looks the same near s as S* does near s', if there is an admissible transformation which is defined in a neighborhood Uofs, takes s into s', and is such that the image of the set of points of S that lie in U is exactly the set of points of S* that lie in the corresponding neighborhood if ofs'. Our subsequent discussion will require a good understanding of the intuitive meaning of equivalence. We will illustrate this with some examples for which p =n = 1. First, consider any two sets S, S' that are graphs of infinitely differentiable functions. Let S, S' be given, respectively, by the equations and x=/2(a). Then S and S' are equivalent. Indeed, we can define an admissible transformation by ol = a x'=x-fi(a)+f2((*). It is clear that this transformation carries S onto S'. Now consider, as our second example, the set S which is the graph of an infinitely differentiable function x =/(a), and the set Sf given by the equation x2 = a. Here it is not hard to prove that S and S' are not equivalent. Indeed, let us proceed by contradiction and assume that an admissible transformation a'=h(a) x = k(a, x)</page><page sequence="35">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 151 exists which carries S onto S'. Since there are two points (a, x) in S' for which a = 1, there must be two points (a, x) in S for which h(d) = 1. But then these two points correspond to the same value of a, and so S is not the graph of a function. Let us say that a point sofa subset S of the a, x plane is an ordinary point of S if, in a neighborhood of s, the set S is the graph of a function x = g(a). Let us say that x is a fold singularity of S if S looks near s like the set S' of solutions of x2 = a looks near the origin of the (a, x) plane. Thorn's theorem for one control parameter assets that 'most' infinitely differentiable functions fia, x) have the property that every point s of the critical set ?J) is either an ordinary point or a fold singularity of C(f). The precise meaning of the word 'most' can only be explained in more technical terms, and we shall do so later, in Section 8. However, at this point there is no need to go beyond the intuitive meaning. We now consider critical sets of functions that involve two parameters. For subsets S of a, ?, x space, we define an ordinary point of S to be a point s Fig. 11.</page><page sequence="36">152 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER near which S is the graph of a function. A fold singularity of S is a point s of S such that S looks near s like the surface S' given by a = x2 looks near (0, 0, 0). Finally, let S" be the critical set off(a,?, x) = x4/4 - ?(3/2)x2 - ax. We say that S has a cusp singularity at s if S looks near s like S" does near (0,0,0). (cf. Figure 11). Thorn's theorem for two parameters says that most infinitely differ entiable functions fia, ?, x) have the property that every point of the critical set Of) of/is either an ordinary point of C(f), or a fold singularity, or a cusp singularity. There are similar theorems for three, four and five parameters. The result for four parameters ? which involves seven different types of singularities, known as the 'seven elementary catastrophes' ? is Thorn's famous classifi cation theorem. The names of the seven elementary catastrophes are: fold, cusp, swallow's tail, butterfly, elliptic umbilic, hyperbolic umbilic, and parabolic umbilic. The theorem for five parameters involves eleven 'element ary catastrophes'. For six or more parameters there exist infinitely many nonequivalent singularities. Our discussion does not require an understanding of these results since, in most proposed applications, only two parameters occur. 6. THE THEOREM AS IT IS USED In his Scientific American article (1976a), Zeeman describes the general reason why, in his view, Catastrophe Theory is likely to have a wide range of applications. ... the underlying forces in nature can be described by smooth surfaces of equilibrium, it is when the equilibrium breaks down that catastrophes occur. The problem for catastrophe theory is therefore to describe the shapes of all possible equilibrium surfaces. Thorn has solved this problem in terms of a few archetypal forms, which he calls elementary catastrophes. The proof of Thorn's theorem is a difficult one, but the results of the proof are relatively easy to comprehend. The elementary catastrophes themselves can be understood and applied to problems in the sciences without reference to the proof. The purpose of this section is to analyze the validity of the preceding claim. We shall start by considering an example of how Zeeman applies Thorn's theorem, and then we shall discuss Zeeman's general claim.</page><page sequence="37">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 153 The general pattern of the 'social science models' involving the cusp surface, as introduced by Zeeman and his coworkers, is as follows: Step I: three variables a, ?, x are singled out. Step 2: a function fia, ?, x) is assumed to govern the behavior by means of the rule that, for each a, ?, the value of x is chosen so as to locally minimize / If more than one local minimum occurs, then the 'delay rule' is used to decide which one is chosen. Precisely, the delay rule asserts that x will remain continuous as long as possible. An illustration of how this rule works is given in Figure 12. We consider a function fia,x) whose graph, as a function of x, is as depicted in the figure for various values of a. Assume that a changes'in time, starting at some value a0 such that a0 &lt;&lt;*!. As long as &lt;*&lt;&lt;*!, there is a unique minimum x, and therefore there is no ambiguity as to the value of x. For ai &lt; a &lt; a2 there are two local minima. However, there is no ambiguity as to the value of x, since the delay rule specifies that the left minimum will be chosen. If a keeps growing and reaches the value a2, then the left minimum disappears, and x jumps. Notice that, if a had varied in the opposite direction, then the jump would have occurred at a = c*i rather than at a = a2. In particular, the value of x is not determined merely by that of a, if a is in the interval ai &lt; a &lt; a2. Further information on the 'history of the system' is needed to determine x. Step 3. Some 'reasonable' qualitative assumptions are made on/. Step 4. It is stated that, from these assumptions, one can conclude, by means of Thorn's theorem, that the critical set of/is equivalent to the cusp surface. What is done after Step 4 has already been illustrated with the example of the aggression model. We now describe these four steps, and their justification, by analyzing the war model of Isnard and Zeeman (1974a). The purpose of the model is to study the decision-making by the administration of a country that is confronted with threats by an enemy and must respond with military activity. Since our aim in this section is to show how Step 4 is carried out ? i.e. how Thorn's theorem is used ? we shall describe Steps 1, 2 and 3 rather quickly. We begin by explaining Step 1, i.e. the choice of the three variables. They are the threat a posed by the enemy, the cost of the war ? which we shall denote by ? ? and the level x of military action. Step 2 requires the choice of a function / to be minimized. We choose,</page><page sequence="38">154 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Fig. 12. The delay rule.

Here is how Pis introduced by Isnard and Zeeman: At a given moment, let P(x) be the number of people in the population that would approve of policy x, in other words would approve of the adoption by the administration of the level x of military action. The number P(x) can be weighted, if one wishes, to take into account the relative influence that different segments of the</page><page sequence="39">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 155 population may have on the administration. Also the function P can be normalized, if one wishes, in other words scaled down so that there is a unit area under the graph. Hence P can be regarded as the probability distribution of public opinion. Having thus explained what P is, Isnard and Zeeman justify the maximization of P and the delay rule. The assumption that x is chosen by the administration so as to maximize P is justified, simply, on the grounds that the administration wants to maximize approval. The Delay Rule is then justified 'sociologically' in five different ways. We shall not analyze this argument here; we prefer to proceed directly to steps 3 and 4. Step 3 is the statement of five hypotheses, the first one of which is mathematical, while the other four are 'sociological'. Hypothesis 1 is that P is smooth and generic. 'Smooth' means infinitely differentiate. 'Generic' has a more technical meaning. Precisely, it means that P has a certain property G, whose mathematical definition does not have to be understood by the reader in order to follow our reasoning.6 The only things that the reader needs to know is that (a) 'most' Fs have G and (b) every P which has G satisfies the conclusions of Thorn's theorem for two parameters ? i.e. the critical set of P consists of ordinary points, folds and cusps. Hypothesis 1 is justified by asserting that "this is a technical but harmless mathematical assumption". We now proceed to state the four 'sociological' hypotheses. Isnard and Zeeman do not say anything to justify them, presumably because they believe that the hypotheses are self-evident. We will discuss later whether this is true (cf. Section 13). Hypothesis 2 is that "If the cost of the war is low, then opinion will be unified, and the greater the threat, the greater will be the level of military action called for". Hypothesis 3 is that "if the cost is high, and the threat moderate, then opinion will be split between doves and hawks". Hypothesis 4 is that "if the cost is high, but the threat very great, then opinion will be unified in favor of strong military action". Finally, Hypothesis 5 asserts that "if the cost is high, but the threat very small, then opinion will be unified in favor of withdrawal". Having presented the five hypotheses, Isnard and Zeeman now use them to conclude that the critical set of the function Pis a cusp surface. This assertion</page><page sequence="40">156 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER is actually made in a somewhat unclear way, which we now describe to the reader. The crucial part is Sections 12 and 13 of the Isnard?Zeeman paper. Section 12 begins with a description of the canonical model for the cusp catastrophe. This is followed by the statement of Thorn's theorem for two control parameters, followed in turn by three technical remarks, and the introduction of two notational conventions. The first one of the two is the agreement that the control variables a, ? that occur in the cusp catastrophe are called the 'normal factor' and the 'splitting factor', respectively. The second convention is that, if the axes in the control plane are drawn differently, in such a way that the axis of the bifurcation curve forms approximately equal angles with the coordinate axes, then the two variables are called 'conflicting factors' (as in the dog aggression model, cf. Figure 5). The authors continue: We emphasize that both of the above notational statements are precise qualitative statements that the graph of x as a function of the controls is equivalent to. the cusp catastrophe. Each statement can play several roles: it can serve as: (i) a theorem, provable from simpler hypotheses, as in the next section, (ii)a hypothesis (or conjecture) providing the theoretical framework for design of experiments, (iii) a bw, summarizing experimental results. The statement itself is a synthesis of many ideas, with the following aspects: Profondity [sic], due to the mathematical uniqueness and stability, depending on deep theorems. Universality. In any aspect of nature, or any scientific experiment, where two factors influence behavior, where splitting and discontinuous effects are observed, and where smooth genericity may be assumed, the graph must contain the cusp catastrophe. Insight. From the model one can explain, predict, and relate a variety of phenomena that previously may not have appeared to be related. As an example we return to the problem on hand. With these words Section 12 ends. Section 13, entitled 'Application of the Cusp Catastrophe', begins as follows: THEOREM. Threat is a normal factor and cost is a splitting factor influencing the level of military action. We are entitled to label this statement as a theorem because it is an immediate corollary of the classification theorem [i.e. Thorn's theorem] and the graphs in Figures 6, 7 arising from the 5 hypotheses in Section 8. Alternatively we could label it as</page><page sequence="41">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 157 a hypothesis, and then the 4 previous sociological hypotheses would be corollaries, testable by experiment. An 'experiment' in this case might take the form of analyzing the behavior of a particular nation over a period and would involve quantifying, that is to say inventing methods of measurement from historical data of indices of cost, threat and action. If sufficiently many experiments were successful,... then the statement would become a candidate for a law. The authors then proceed to show how the model can be used to derive predictions, by considering several paths in control space, much as the dog aggression model is used (cf. Section 3). 7. USE OR MISUSE? In the preceding section, we quoted that part of the Isnard?Zeeman paper dealing with the main theorem. If a proof is actually given, it must be somehow contained in the words we quoted. However, these words do not contain any statement, or sequence of statements, that are labelled as the proof of the theorem. They do contain a number of expressions that are likely to intimidate the non-mathematical reader (e.g. the reference to 'profondity', 'universality', 'insight', the mention of 'deep mathematics'). Moreover, the assertion that the theorem is a theorem is made quite clearly, but a small amount of confusion is added by the statement that the 'theorem' could also be labeMed a 'hypothesis'. Leaving these expository problems aside, we must concentrate on the main questions of this section, namely: (a) does the theorem follow from the hypotheses of the Isnard?Zeeman model? And, if it does, (b) does it follow because of 'deep mathematics' ? i.e. Thorn's classification theorem ? or is it just a mere rewording of the hypotheses? It will turn out that question (a) cannot be answered in a clear-cut way, because the 'sociological hypotheses' of the model are not stated as precisely as would be needed to decide whether the theorem follows from them. As in our discussion of the dog aggression model, we will find a basic ambiguity at a fundamental point. But we will show that, no matter how the ambiguity is removed, one of the following is true: either the theorem does not follow at all from the hypotheses, or it is a mere restatement of them, and does not require the use of any deep mathematics. The ambiguity in the hypotheses is due to the authors' use of the words</page><page sequence="42">158 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER 'low' and 'high' in their statement. The hypotheses involve some assertions about what happens when the cost is 'low', and when the cost is 'high'. For high cost, separate hypotheses are made about the behavior for high, moderate, and small threat. What do these words mean? In mathematics, the words, 'small' and 'large', or 'low' and 'high' are not unambiguous technical terms. Some statements involving these words have a unanimously agreed upon technical interpretation. (For instance, the sentence 'fix) is small whenever x is small' is usually interpreted as making the technically unambiguous assertion that lim fix) = 0.) But the statements that appear in the 'sociological hypotheses' of Isnard and Zeeman are not ofthat sort. Let us consider a statement S of the form: 'When y is small A happens, and whenjv is large B happens'. Such a statement can be interpreted in at least two different ways: First way: S asserts that there exists a threshold value y0 such that (a) A happens whenever y &lt; y0 and (b) B happens whenever y &gt; y0. Second way: S asserts that there exist values yi,y2, such that (a) y i &lt;y2i (b)A happens whenever y &lt;yx and (c)B happens whenjy &gt;y2. We shall refer to the first and second way as the total and partial interpretation of S, respectively. The reason for our choice of terminology is quite simple: under the total interpretation of S, the statement actually tells us what happens for all values of y (except for y =y0). Under the partial interpretation, there is a whole range of values of y ? the interval yi^y^y2 ? about which S asserts nothing. It is clear that statements such as 'A happens for low y, B for high y and C for moderate y* can also be interpreted totally or partially. Now let us return to the war model. If the 'sociological hypotheses' are given the total interpretation, then the resulting translation reads as follows: There exists a value ?0 of the cost such that (i) For every value ? of the cost which is less than ?0, and every value a of the threat, the function x -&gt; P(a, ?, x) has a unique maximum. The value ofx where this maximum is reached increases, for each ?, as a increases. (ii) For each ?&gt;?o there are aiy a2 - depending on ?- such that &lt;*i &lt;a2, and that, for a&lt;ax, or a&gt;a2, the function x -&gt;P(a, ?,x) has a unique maximum, whereas for ax &lt; a &lt; a2 the function has two maxima. If this interpretation is accepted, then it is clear that the hypotheses of the Isnard?Zeeman model already describe the set of critical points of P for</page><page sequence="43">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 159 every point (a, ?) of the control plant. In particular, these hypotheses state that the critical set of the function P has the shape of the cusp surface. Now consider the second possibility, i.e. that the statements that contain words such as 'high' and 'low' are given the partial interpretation. If this is the case, then the 'sociological hypotheses' of Isnard and Zeeman assert nothing at all about the nature of the critical set for a certain range of values of the control parameters. (For instance, if we interpret them as asserting that there are values ?i, ?2 such that ?1 &lt; ?2 and that P(a, ?, x) has one maximum for ?&lt;?i, and one or three ? depending on a - for ? &gt; ?2, then the hypotheses say nothing about what happens for ?i &lt;?&lt;?2.) In this case, Isnard and Zeeman are asserting that, by means of Thorn's theorem, one can draw conclusions about the critical set even for those values of a, ? for which the hypotheses specify nothing. But this is false. Thorn's theorem asserts that, for 'most' functions fia, ?, x), the critical set of / consists of ordinary points, folds and cusps. The theorem does not say how many cusps there are. It is very easy to draw surfaces that satisfy all the 'sociological hypotheses' of Isnard and Zeeman ? interpreted in the 'partial' way ? and yet have any number of cusp singularities. We have therefore seen that, if the hypotheses are given the total interpretation, then the cusp surface is really a part of the hypotheses, and Thorn's theorem plays no role in inferring it. If the partial interpretation is given, then the use of Thorn's theorem is illegitimate, since the theorem does not imply what Isnard and Zeeman claim it does. In either case, the reasoning is faulty. Is this flaw in the reasoning a minor point or a major one? Here, we must remind the reader of the fact that the 'use of Thorn's theorem' is the only mathematically nontrivial step in the whole paper. We have already quoted the awe-inspiring words which Isnard and Zeeman use to present this step ('profondity', 'mathematical uniqueness and stability', 'deep theorems', 'universality', 'insight'). As in a good magician's performance, the words serve the purpose of directing our attention away from where the sleight-of-hand is being performed. Most readers are likely to be so intimidated by such words that the mathematical incorrectness will go unnoticed. The method of 'reasoning' that we have illustrated by means of the war model of Isnard and Zeeman is actually an essential feature of Zeeman's proposed applications of Catastrophe Theory. A false impression is conveyed that the 'deep mathematics' of the theory makes it possible to get nontrivial</page><page sequence="44">160 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER conclusions from qualitative hypotheses. In his description of the dog aggression model, in his Scientific American article, Zeeman makes the mathematically false assertion that Through catastrophe theory we can deduce the shape of the entire surface from the fact that the behavior is bimodal for some control points. We have already examined how the step is carried out in the war paper. Let us briefly quote two more examples. In his paper on prison disturbances (1976b), the crucial step is again carried out by asserting: We now appeal to the classification theory catastrophe theory (Thorn, 1972) and deduce that G and T together form a smooth surface equivalent to the cusp-catastrophe surface. Again, no indication is provided of how this 'deduction' is made. In the stock exchange model (1974b), the same pattern recurs. Zeeman says that We now use the deep classification theorem of Thorn to synthesize the information acquired so far into a 3-dimensional picture of the surface S. Zeeman then proceeds to describe the picture, but no explanation is given of why the theorem of Thorn implies that S has the proposed shape.7 7.1. Thorn's Theorem is Inherently Uninformative We can now return to the statement that we quoted earlier, in which Zeeman describes why Catastrophe Theory should work. According to Zeeman, "the problem for Catastrophe Theory is... to describe the shapes of all possible equilibrium surfaces". And "Thorn has solved this problem in terms of a few archetypal forms". In the minds of many readers, Zeeman's assertion is likely to suggest that the "shapes of all possible equilibrium surfaces" that Thorn has classified are somehow like the shapes of all possible planetary orbits that Newton described. But these two classification results are of a very different nature! From simple postulates (F = ma, and the inverse square law), Newton was able to deduce that the orbits necessarily were conic sections. This conclusion is highly nontrivial, and it leads to very precise predictions, because the class of curves thus singled out by Newton is a very</page><page sequence="45">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 161 small one. 'Most' curves are not conic sections and therefore, if we know of a certain curve C that it is a conic section, we have a lot of information about C. For instance, if we succeed in determining five points of C, then we know the whole curve. So, if C is the trajectory of a heavenly body, a few observations of its position suffice to make it possible to determine its position for all past and future times. How does Thorn's theorem compare with our example of Newton's theory? First of all, Thorn's theorem is about 'most' families of functions. It involves no hypotheses that place nontrivial constraints on the functions, i.e. no 'physical laws'. Second, the class 2 of those surfaces that appear in the conclusions of Thorn's theorem is the class of all surfaces whose only singularities are of a certain type. This class is indistinguishable, for all practical purposes, from the class of all surfaces. Indeed, the following three facts are true (and easy to prove): (1) Every surface can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a surface in 2. (2) The surfaces in 2 are 'nonrigid' in the following sense: if S is in 2 and if U, V are disjoint regions in space, and T is an arbitrary surface in V, then there are surfaces S' in 2 that are arbitrarily close to T in V, while coinciding with S on U. (3) If F is any finite set of points whatsoever, then there is a surface in 2 that passes through all the points in F. Property (1) implies that, for an experimenter, there is no way to test the hypothesis that a surface is in 2. Indeed, all observations have an error. Therefore any arbitrary surface S is observationally indistinguishable from some surface Sf in 2. (Just take S' to be a surface in 2 that approximates S to within a distance smaller than the error.) Property (3) says that any set of observations is consistent with the hypothesis that the set of possible states is a surface in 2. Finally, property (2) asserts that a knowledge of the surface in some region says nothing whatsoever about the surface in any other region. What the preceding remarks amount to is the following very simple conclusion: if we wish to describe systems that obey equilibrium equations, then Thorn's theorem is not helpful. It actually is not much better than the tautologous statement that 'an equilibrium surface is a surface'. Knowing that S is not just any surface, but a surface that satisfies the properties of Thorn's</page><page sequence="46">162 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER theorem, gives very little extra information about S, since the properties that occur in Thorn's theorem are local. It is not surprising that this should be the case. Since Thorn's theorem involves no behavioral hypotheses whatsoever ? nothing like, say, Newton's inverse square law ? it is natural that its conclusion should say nothing whatever about behavior. Suggesting that one can deduce nontrivial facts about 'the shape of all possible equilibrium surfaces' from a theory that makes no physical or behavioral assumptions is tantamount to claiming that the world can be deduced by pure thought, a claim which, so far, has not proved very successful. Summarizing, we can draw the following conclusions: (a) The claim that Thorn's theorem can be used to infer the shape of a surface from some partial knowledge of it is false. (b) The claim is repeatedly made by Zeeman and his coworkers. (c) The main step of most of Zeeman's ACT papers depends crucially on it. Without Thorn's theorem to lend an aura of mathematical depth, Zeeman's social science models become no more than attempts to fit a certain surface in various contexts. The particular choice of a surface that is made in Catastrophe Theory is no longer forced onto us for 'deep mathematical reasons', but it is a rather arbitrary one. ///. ZEEMAN'S NERVE IMPULSE MODELS 8. CRITICAL SETS AS ATTRACTORS As a preliminary to our discussion of Zeeman's nerve impulse models, we describe how critical sets of functions (such as the cusp surface) can.appear as attractor surfaces. Consider a system of equations ? f (F) ex = - ? (ai,...,ah,x) ?i =?i(ai&gt;... ,&lt;*,,,x) (S) . &lt;*h =^(ai5.-.5^,x), where the dots indicate differentiation with respect to time, and where e is a small positive parameter.</page><page sequence="47">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 163 The first equation can be rewritten as dx 1 bf , (F&gt; d?"" ?&lt;" * *&gt; If e is very small, then the right side of this equation will be much larger than that of the other equations. Hence x will be changing much faster than ax,... , an. For this reason, we can refer to (F) as the fast equation, and to (S) as the slow equation. If e is very small, then it is reasonable to expect that the behavior described by our system of equations will be as follows. If we start at a point p? = (a?x,..., a%, x?), for which (bf/bx)(p?) * 0 then x will vary very fast, while ax,... ,ah will remain approximately constant. If (bf/bx) is positive, then x will decrease all the way to ? &lt;?, or until it reaches a value for which /, as a function of x, has a local minimum. If bf/bx is negative, then x will increase, and therefore / will decrease (smce (bf/bx) &lt; 0). So, either x will go to + ??, or to a value for which/has a local minimum. Once a minimum has been reached, the right side of (F )will no longer be large, and the slow equations will not be negligible anymore. So the point p will now evolve according to the slow equations. However, every time ax,..., ah change by some amounts Aax,... , &amp;an, then the value x which was an equilibrium for ax,...,an (i.e. for which fiai,...,an,x), regarded as a function of x, had a minimum) will no longer be an equilibrium for at + Aax,..., ah + ?an. Hence the right side of (F') will no longer be zero, and the fast equation will force x to readjust. If there is a value x + A x, close to x, at which fiai + Ac^,..., an + Aa^, x) has a local minimum, then (F ) will force x to move towards this value. However, it may happen that no such value exists. In this case x will change very fast, so as to make / decrease until a new minimum is reached. In the limit, as e -? 0, the resulting behavior is therefore as follows: (I) the fast equation pulls the point P = (&lt;*i,..., c$, x?) to the critical set of/and, more precisely, to that point E(p) that has the same oti,..., a/, coordinates asp, and whose x coordinate x is characterized by the conditions that (i) fia\,... ,olyl,x) has a minimum at x and (ii) as x varies from x? to x,f decreases.8 The points (ax,..., ah, x) for which /, as a function of x, has a local minimum are called locally stable equilibria.

Consider the equations ex = ?(x3 -x +a) ? = x (Here a is one dimensional, and fia, x) = (x4/4) - (x2/2) + ax). The critical set of / is the set of solutions of x3 - x + a = 0, i.e. the cubic curve in the (a, x) plane with equation a = x - x3. The sign of bf/bx is as shown in Figure 15. The dynamical behavior that arises is shown in Figure 16. We see that, if we start at, say, point P, then the fast dynamic will pull P down to point Q. There the slow dynamic will move us along the critical set, until the threshold point T is reached. When this happens, we jump down to point A, and then the slow dynamic causes motion to the left, until T is reached. There follows a jump to A, smooth Fig. 15.

The 'catastrophes' (i.e., the jumps) occur at those points where the critical set has singularities (folds, in this case). A more complicated example, involving the cusp catastrophe surface, will be considered in Section 10. 9. SMOOTH VS. JUMP, AND SLOW VS. FAST Many of the proposed applications of Catastrophe Theory involve the use of models in which some variables are 'faster' than the others. As shown in Section 8, this leads naturally to the consideration of critical sets and catastrophe points. There are, however, many conceptual difficulties with these ideas, which the catastrophists usually ignore.</page><page sequence="52">168 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER The main difficulty arises from the concepts that Catastrophe Theory is supposedly best equipped to handle: the ideas of jump and discontinuity. What is a jump? There is a very precise mathematical idea which, sometimes, is regarded as an appropriate formalization of the intuitive idea of 'jump'. Mathematically a function fit) of one variable has a jump discontinuity at t = t0 if the left and right limits of/ at t0 exist and are different. But, is this what we mean when we talk about jumps in some physical or biological or social system? It is easy to see that the answer is 'no'. First, because a very small jump in some variable might not be perceived as a jump (in fact, it might not be perceived at all). Second, because a very large continuous change that occurs in a very short time interval is, for all practical purposes, the same as a jump. So the local properties of the function /, in the sense of the mathematical theory of continuity of functions, are not the same as what we really mean by 'jump'. What we need is to have a large value of Af=fit + Ai) ?fit) for some small value of Ai, and it does not matter too much whether / is continuous or not. How large does A/have to be? How small must At be? As usual, this is a question that cannot be given a precise answer since, in the terminology of Section 4, the 'jump?no jump' dichotomy is a subjective one. Catastrophe theorists play with both uses of the word 'jump', the technical one and the intuitive one. They alternate between them, and use them in an inconsistent way. They prove theorems about the 'technical' jump, and claim that these say something about jumps in our everyday sense. A good illustration of this is Zeeman's 'proof, in his nerve impulse paper (1972a, p. 22, Lemma 3), that, in two dimensions, there cannot exist a system in which there is a threshold, from which a jump occurs, followed by smooth return to equilibrium. The proof is topological, and it involves looking at Figure 16, and observing that, once we are on an attractor arc such asyl' T\ there cannot be a return to a point such as A unless the attractor folds over, thus creating a new threshold T\ and a nonsmooth jump to A. This 'proof is correct only if one is allowed to shift from one interpretation of the word 'jump' to the other at will, but not if a single interpretation is used throughout. Indeed, let us first recall that the idea of talking about 'fast' and 'slow' dynamics was justified only for very small e, and that the discon tinuous behavior only occurs in the limit e -+ 0. For any nonzero value of e, the trajectories are continuous. In reality (and in the Catastrophe Theory</page><page sequence="53">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 169 models) e is not zero (often, it is not even small). So no jumps in the technical mathematical sense can occur. Therefore, in order to even talk about attractors, thresholds and fast and slow dynamics, we must mean 'jump' in the everyday, nonmathematical sense. However, this meaning of 'jump' has to be changed if we want our conclusion. Indeed, the assertion that there must be another threshold Ie only implies that there is another mathematical jump. But nothing whatsover seems to prevent the threshold T* from being very close to the point A, in which case the 'jump' from TxoA will be a mathematical discontinuity but not a jump in the everyday sense of the word, since the change in the value of x can be as small as desired (cf. Section 10, especially Figure 20). So we have found yet another instance of what we described in earlier sections: ambiguous words are used with inconsistent meanings and, when the ambiguity is eliminated, nothing remains except for incorrect mathematics. That there is difficulty with the idea of 'jump' had already been pointed out in Section 4, in our discussion of the dog aggression model. The problem described here is essentially of the same nature. Now let us consider the distinction between 'fast' and 'slow' variables, which has no parallel in the dog aggression model. Here, again, we see that the concepts are ambiguous. What is a 'fast' variable? In ? topological theory, any variable can be regarded as fast, or slow, after a change of coordinates. A good example of what can be done with 'fast' and 'slow' can be found in Jones (1975a). After devising a model in which it is predicted that a certain variable will rise very fast at some time t0, comparison with data shows that the variable does indeed rise, but very slowly. Jones then proceeds to change to a logarithmic scale, and finds that, in the new scale, fast increase takes place as predicted! In an equation such as ex =x3, a change of coordinates can change the value of e at will. For instance, let r &gt; 0 be arbitrary. Change coordinates by letting Then, in terms of y, the equation reads</page><page sequence="54">170 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER or ry=y3. So, by a change of coordinates, e can be changed into any arbitrarily prescribed positive number r. In particular, 'fast' can be made 'slow', and vice versa. It is only for the limiting singular theory obtained by letting e - 0, that the distinction between fast and slow makes sense in a topologicai setting. For a theory with e ?* 0, it does not. 10. ANALYSIS OF THE NERVE IMPULSE MODEL E. C. Zeeman's model of the nerve impulse (Zeeman, 1972a, hereafter called HNI) attempts to improve on the Nobel-Prize-winning neurophysiological work of A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley (1952, hereafter referred to as HH; see also Hodgkin, 1964a) relating the potential difference V across a nerve membrane to changes in sodium and potassium conductane (?Na and^K) ?f the membrane. The object is to account for the observed 'action potential' (Figure 17b) which travels down certain types of nerve axons when one end is electrically stimulated. In a series of experiments using a technique known as voltage clamp, Hodgkin and Huxley first studied the time course of the membrane potential under conditions where there was no traveling impulse, and the potential itself was held fixed by an external feedback circuit. From this and other laboratory results they expressed the membrane-potential-versus-time function as the sum of two main components, corresponding to the transmembrane flow of sodium and potassium ions. A somewhat speculative model was set up to account for the implied membrane conductance changes during voltage clamp. When the standard equation for an electrical cable was combined with the clamp model, a system of differential equations resulted. Hodgkin and Huxley found that numerical solutions of the system provided a good approximation to the observed shape and speed of the traveling wave. The Hodgkin?Huxley equations have since been centrally important through out neurophysiology. Zeeman's models also attempt to account for both the voltage-clamp results and the propagated action potential; the main difference from (HH) is the derivation, via catastrophe theory, of new functions describing the</page><page sequence="55">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 171 synapses Fig. 17a. A nerve cell (HNI p. 9). Fig. 17b. Action potential in squid giant axon at 18.5? C. (HNI p. 12). sodium and potassium conductances. It is first observed that the nerve membrane potential, once displaced from equilibrium by a stimulus larger than a certain threshold value, exhibits first a sudden rise, then a 'smooth' return to equilibrium (Figure 17b). Zeeman argues that such a phenomenon is impossible in a dynamical system in two variables (HNI, p. 22), and thus attempts to find the simplest possible paradigm in three dimensions. Such a dynamic can be constructed in the surface of the canonical cusp catastrophe (Figure 18). Moreover, Zeeman claims that this is not only possible but necessary. Invoking Thorn's theorem, Zeeman concludes that</page><page sequence="56">172 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Fig. 18. Model I. "the criteria of topological and biological simplicity imply the existence of a cusp". (HNI, p. 31). We thus obtain Model I (HM, p. 32) (1) ex = -(x3 +ax+b) (2) ? = -2a-2x (3) b = -a - 1 where e is small, b is identified with the membrane potential V, a with g^, and-x with^Na Here, according to Zeeman, is how Modell (as pictured in Figure 18) corresponds to the voltage clamp data (Figure 19).

Voltage Clamp Data of Hodgkin and Huxley (Fig. 23 of HNI). (where it is held fixed by the external circuit), so the state moves from the equilibrium E to the point F in the clamp plane V = Vc. Next, the fast equation (1) moves the state rapidly to the point G on the slow manifold, and the slow equation (2) carries the state to H (the point on the clamp plane where a = 0). Thus, "the effect of the voltage clamp on the sodium conductance #Na is a fast increase along the path FG, followed by a slow decrease GH, while the effect on the potassium conductance gK is a delay FG, followed by a slow increase GIT\ (HNI, p. 50). While he asserts that Model I presents "all the correct qualitative features observed during experiments" (HNI, p. 34), Zeeman goes on to build a second model which attempts to be more quantitatively accurate. First, by the conceptual experiment of cutting the axon at a point y before and after the arrival of the propagated action potential at y, Zeeman emphasizes the importance of keeping the equations for the local action potential in time (at</page><page sequence="58">174 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER the fixed point y) separate from the global propagation wave (moving in both space and time). The local action potential can be obtained by fitting the experimental voltage clamp data of (HH). Zeeman keeps the canonical cusp catastrophe, equation (1) of Model I, but modifies the other two as follows. Following neurophysiological procedure, the transmembrane current I is written (4) I = cV +gK(V - VK) +*Na(V - VNa) +?C1(V - Vcl) (HNI, p. 53), where c = membrane capacity per unit area, and each subscripted V is a constant 'equilibrium potential' for the respective species of ion (Cl = chloride ion). Zeeman then argues that I = 0 is a reasonable assumption for voltage clamp, thus obtaining from (4) a second equation. The third equation comes from an ad hoc fit of the voltage clamp data. We thus arrive at Model II: (5) x=-1.25(x3+ax+Z&gt;) (6) ? = (x + 0.06(0 + 0.5))(x - 1 .Sa - 1.67)(0.054(Z&gt; - 0.8)2 + 0.75) (7) b = -gK(b + 1.4) -gNii(b - 4.95) -gcl(b - 0.15) (HNI, p. 54) where now b, a, and x are no longer the same as V, gK, and -gNa ', instead (8) V = 20Z&gt; + 16; 2.38(? + 0.5) a &gt; -0.5 otherwise; (9) *k={o ? 16(x+0.5)2 (10) ^Na=(0 x &lt; -0,5 otherwise. Model II leads to a dynamic like that shown in Figure 18, except that the equilibrium is shifted slightly from the point E: (b = 0, a = ? 1, x = 1), to (b = - 0.8, a = - 0.4, x = 1.07), and a saddle point is created on the upper surface of the cusp. Zeeman now applies Model II to the propagation problem. Assume that the propagated action potential is a traveling wave which proceeds uniformly with constant velocity 0. Also assume that at any location on the axon the value of V is determined by the traveling wave up to a point /, and afterwards</page><page sequence="59">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 175 by the local equations of Model II. From the experimentally observed action potential (Figure 17b), one estimates numerical values of V and V at /, and calculates 0 = 21.9 m sec"1, which "agrees well with the observed velocity of 21.2 m sec"1 ... and is slightly better than the Hodgkin?Huxley computa tion of 18.8 msec?1,." (HNI, p. 58.) The shape of the propagated action potential calculated from Model II is also asserted to be better than that given by the Hodgkin?Huxley theory. While explaining that the quantitative features of Model II are subject to revision, Zeeman concludes by comparing this model favorably with Hodgkin and Huxley's in several other ways, and offering suggestions on how the cusp models might be tested experimentally. The beguiling paper which presents Models I and II also contains a stimulating introduction to the mathematical theory of dynamical systems, which has given new insights to many readers. The paper is enjoyable reading, an elegant piece of mathematical exposition. Nevertheless, we claim that the models themselves are poorly justified and fail completely to provide a reasonable paradigm for the nerve impulse. Furthermore, their few successes are based entirely on the experimental data and have no relation to the catastrophe theory. We will show this by analyzing first Zeeman's general conceptual framework, then the voltage clamp model, and finally the propagated action potential. Central to the derivation of the cusp models as the inescapable, simplest possible analogues of the nerve is the notion of 'fast' and 'slow' variables (a well-known concept in dynamical systems theory for years before catastrophe theory) which stems in turn from the 'jump' rise as opposed to the 'smooth' return. Elsewhere we discuss the mathematical problems involved in the use of terms such as 'fast' and 'slow' in a topological setting (cf. Section 9). Here the difficulties are easier to see. Model I is developed by letting x (corresponding to gNa) be the fast variable, while a and b (corresponding to gK and V, respectively) are the slow ones. In reality, however, if we measure speed in terms of relaxation times, V and #Na are the fastest, while g^ is much slower (R. Fitzhugh, 1969). Zeeman attempts to circumvent this apparent contradiction by equations (8)?(10): V and#Na are greatly speeded up compared to b and x, while gK is only about twice as fast as a. (In terms of relaxation times at the equilibrium point, however, #n8 remains the fastest variable in Zeeman's model II, while V is the slowest). Changes of scale by fiat are fine from the abstract topological viewpoint. But they destroy the</page><page sequence="60">176 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER rationale offered for the model, for if one allows scale factors which have different values at different points in the plane (such as Zeeman's), 'fast' and 'slow' lose any intuitive meaning. For the same reason, the parameters x and a lack physiological meaning (even qualitatively), unlike those of the Hodgkin?Huxley model. (Zeeman expresses the hope that they may describe some aspects of the underlying membrane chemistry, but the process by which they were defined makes this doubtful, to say the least). The misuse of the dichotomy of 'jump' versus 'smooth' in the work of the catastrophists is also discussed in Section 9. From the rigorous mathematical standpoint, though, notice that equations (9) and (10) display gNa and^K as non-smooth functions of x and a. This is inconsistent with the use of Thorn's theorem, which holds only in the category of smooth functions. There are other problems, however. Even if we accept Zeeman's premise that the nerve exhibits a smooth return, his 'proof that this cannot be modeled in R2 (HNI, p. 22) is spurious. He argues (Figures 20a and 20b) that, after starting at the threshold T and being carried quickly to A (the 'jump') by the fast vertical vector field, there is no way to return to equilibrium E without another vertical jump upwards. This would be true if we insisted, as Zeeman does surreptitiously, that the quantity e in equations such as (1), which can be thought of as the ratio of slow (horizontal) speed to fast (vertical) speed, be a constant. But there is no reason why e may not be a function of x and b, designed to be very small on the line TA and moderate on BE. Then TA would be a jump, yet BE would be a smooth return. Alternatively, a piece of slow manifold might approach E as close as desired (Figure 20b); then the final 'jump' BE would be completely imperceptible in any experiment. Let us move from these general considerations to an evaluation of how well the catastrophe-theory models explain voltage clamp. Here w? have four main criticisms. 1. Discontinuous response to continuous change of clamp voltage. Although the nerve response is sudden for any given value of the clamp voltage V^, if we compare the recorded response-current curves for different clamp values we find that the curves change continuously. In Zeeman's models, however, when the clamp is turned on the state point jumps either to the upper or the lower attractor surface of the smooth manifold, depending on whether Vc is smaller or larger than a certain critical value V? (Figure 18). Thus the</page><page sequence="61">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 177 b (?low) Fig. 20a. Fig. 20b. behavior changes abruptly as Vc passes V?, unlike the experimental result (Cole, 1968a, Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz, 1952a, p. 431-434). Further, the model predicts that the steady-state value ofgK will be small if Vc &lt; V?, and much larger if VC&gt;V?; it also forecasts that gK will increase almost immediately (no 'delay') when the clamp is turned on, if Vc &lt; Vj. Both of these predictions are qualitatively very different from experimental results (Compare Figure 19).</page><page sequence="62">178 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER 2. Independence of K and Na channels. Zeeman explains (HNI, p. 61) that his model assumes that the membrane permeabilities (conductances) for potassium and sodium are interrelated: "In essence we say that the potassium conductance cannot begin to rise until the sodium conductance has reached its peak." He contrasts this to (HH)'s assumption that the two permeabilities are independent. In fact this 'assumption' of independence has been experimentally verified both by use of radioactive potassium and the selective neurotoxins TTX and TEA (Ehrenstein and Lecar, 1972a, p. 356). Further more, Zeeman's models are both based on his Figure 24, which consists of curves constructed by Hodgkin and Huxley on the assumption that gNa and gK were independent. This further weakens the theoretical underpinnings of the catastrophe theory models. Alternatively, if the catastrophe theory models are viewed as 'predicting' that#K and^Na are interdependent, then this prediction contradicts experiment. A related misunderstanding of physiology occurs, on p. 62, where Zeeman points out that his Model II has no inward sodium leak at or near the resting potential, remarks that there is no experimental evidence for such a leak, and goes on to speculate about the significance of this new insight. In fact, however, the inward sodium leak at the resting potential is firmly established experimentally in a wide variety of cells (Hodgkin, 1964a, p. 73) and is a commonplace of modern cell biology. 3. (Model I) Shut-off of the voltage clamp. On page 50 (HNI) it is stated, "If the clamp is released then the state returns to equilibrium E along the dotted flow lines of the slow equations". (Cf. Figure 18). This would be true if 'turning off the clamp meant that the membrane potential was suddenly allowed to vary freely after having been fixed electronically at the value Vc. In the actual experiment, however, the membrane is under voltage clamp the whole time: the clamp voltage is changed discontinuously from a starting value (often equal to the resting potential) to a different potential, with a final discontinuous return to the original value. If the steady-state under the clamped voltage Vc is the point H of Figure 18, then returning the clamp voltage to zero corresponds to holding the dynamics in the plane b = 0 (note that zero on the ft-axis is misplaced in Figure 23 of HNI) and following the trajectory of the projection of H on this plane. Figure 21 is a sketch of the phase plane b = 0. Notice that the origin is a</page><page sequence="63">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 179 Fig. 21. RS is the line ? = 0. The locus of x = 0 is the parabola POQ, together with the a axis. singular critical point which is stable on one side and unstable on the other. Thus if the potential is returned exactly to zero, the system returns not to E but to the origin. A similar phase-plane analysis for small values of I b I reveals that, subject to the random fluctuations to be expected in a physical system, the state, point will return either to E or to the origin, at random. This is not what happens in experiments: the final resting value is a predictable function of the clamp voltage. 4. (Model II) The applied current. On page 54 (HNI) Zeeman notes that Model II is based on the assumption I = 0, where I is the total outward flow of current across the membrane per unit area. In the voltage clamp experiment, however, the membrane potential is controlled electronically and what is recorded is the transmembrane current. Thus a model with 1 = 0 cannot describe the voltage clamp experiment. At this point someone might reply that the voltage-clamp situation is only</page><page sequence="64">180 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER an artificial experimental setup; the key test of a nerve fibre model should be the propagated action potential, which is, after all, the way the nerve actually goes about transmitting impulses. Here two further difficulties arise: 5. Calculation of the speed of propagation. Zeeman derives the speed 0 of the nerve impulse in squid giant axon from Model II as follows. First, he proves, using the local nerve impulse equations (5)?(10): LEMMA. If the resting potential is perturbed then the outward ionic current is approx imately kW per unit area of membrane, where k = 0.388. (HNI, p. 57.) Now define I by equation (4). Using the standard equation for an electric core-conductor cable, together with the assumption that the propagated action potential is a traveling wave which proceeds uniformly with constant velocity, an expression for V in the initial rising phase of the propagated action potential is derived (HNI, Th. 3, p. 57). Then values of V and V are obtained from an experiment of Hodgkin and Huxley and used to calculate 0 = 21.9 m sec"1. This is claimed to be 'slightly better' than the Hodgkin? Huxley computation of 0. In reality, however, this computation has nothing to do with Zeeman's cusp models. For the only place the models are used is in the proof of the above lemma, where they are invoked only to establish that near equilibrium ?k ~ 0.238, gNa =0, and gC\ = 0.15. But Zeeman has obtained the resting values of #Na and gc\ used nere fr?m experimental data, and once these are given, the resting value of #k follows at once from (4) ? which is a well-known equation ? by setting I = V = 0 and using experimentally deter mined values of Vjc, VNa, Vc?, and the resting potential V. The rest of the calculation of 0 is no more original. So it is unfair to claim this calculation of the speed of propagation as favorable evidence for the cusp models ? it is an old-fashioned calculation based solely on experimental data that have nothing to do with these models. A correct computation of the propagation speed implied by Zeeman's Model II requires the analysis below. 6. Numerical calculation of the shape of the traveling wave. Zeeman's determination of the shape of the propagated action potential is a heuristic argument based on the following two assumptions:</page><page sequence="65">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 181 A. The propagated action potential is a traveling wave with velocity 0=21.9 m sec"1. B. At any location y on the axon, the potential V(y, t) as a function of time t is determined by the traveling wave up to a point t = /, and afterwards by the local equations (5)?(10). In general, however, the existence of a traveling wave solution - that is, one which maintains exactly the same temporal profile as it propagates spatially? is not guaranteed, and we have seen that the value 0=21.9 cannot be deduced from Zeeman's Model II. In support of (B), Zeeman argues that the propagating wave traverses a 1 mm length of axon 100 times faster than the duration of the complete local action potential, and this justifies the separation of local and global phenomena. Although '10 times faster ' would be a fairer estimate (he has simultaneously exaggerated the speed of propagation in the squid giant axon and underestimated the duration of the action potential), the basic fact is that there is no rigorous way to justify the proposed method of solution. From the physiological point of view, the problem is that Zeeman's 'solution' is found by numerically solving the ordinary differential equations for the 1 = 0 situation of Model II, ignoring the current contributed by the cable equation. The correct way to obtain the propagated action potential (HH, pp. 522?524, Fitzhugh, op. cit.) is to start with the partial differential equation obtained from the membrane ordinary differential equations (5)?(10) combined with the cable equation, convert this to an ordinary differential equation by assuming that the solution is a function of t+ (y/0) = s, and find that value of 0 for which the solution remains bounded as s approaches ? ??. (This value of 0 is the speed of propagation). When this is done, we obtain the equation (11) ^ -lfV-gK(b + 1.4) -gm(b- 4.95) -gcl(b- 0.15) = 0 along with (5) and (6). (See HNI for the notation.) After substituting numerical values for the constants, the search for the proper 0 value can be carried out on a computer using standard methods for the numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential equations. We have tested Model II applied to the propagated action potential in this way. Initial conditions for V and V were calculated, following (HH), as</page><page sequence="66">182 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER follows. Fix 0, and let K = 2p02 c/r. Near equilibrium, the resting con ductance g0 is 0.388 mmho cm"2 (cf. HNI, p. 57). Replacing the last three terms in (11) by g0i the solution of the resulting equation is V(t) = V(0)e?t, where ?jl is a solution of M2-Km-1Wc = 0. Then we take V(0) = ;uV(0), where V(0) = 0.1 mV. We find that for numerous values of 0, ranging from 30 m sec"1 down to 1.5 msec"1 at least, the solution V(s) tends monotonically to +?&gt; as s increases; in other words, after the potential begins rising at the start of the impulse, it keeps rising forever without ever beginning a descent toward equilibrium (Table I). This certainly looks nothing like the observed action potential (cf. Figure 17b). Even if it turns out that there is a value of 0 so small that the corresponding solution remains bounded, it is clear that the speed of propagation predicted by Model II is at least an order of magnitude away from the correct answer. We have shown that the catastrophe-theory models are capable of explaining neither the voltage clamp data nor the propagated action potential. It is thus hard to see how Zeeman can compare his work to that of Hodgkin and Huxley and their followers, especially since the latter model also provides TABLE I Sample numerical solution of Model II equations for propagated impulse 0(msec"1) rNa(msec) V(fNa)(mV) rsoo(msec) 27 .40 693 .39 20 .68 340 .72 10 2.33 116 2.81 5 8.0 54 10.6 2.5 27 32 36.5 1.5 66.5 26.8 86.3 ?Na = time when #Na turns on- f s 0 0 = time when V exceeds 500 mV (arbitrarily chosen nonphysiological level).

In fact, however, the catastrophe-theory approach makes no testable predictions at all, despite Zeeman's insistence that it "provides explicit equations for testing experimentally" (HNI, p. 8). For example, Zeeman points out that a small perturbation of Model II leads to a neuron which would start firing by itself periodically with no triggering impulse, and suggests that this might be "a fruitful source of experiments". Since this behavior can also be obtained from the Hodkin?Huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models, however, it cannot be used as a way of checking the cusp model. Later (HNI, p. 62) Zeeman 'tentatively' suggests that the cut-off devices built into equations (9) and (10) could relate to the mechanism of certain unknown membrane transport systems and "perhaps may suffice to germinate more specific chemical hypotheses that can be tested experimentally".These suggestions are so vague, though, that it is hard to see how they could be of any use to an experimenter looking for specific membrane transport substances. In fact, we know of no transport system which has been found to exhibit such cut-off behavior, nor for that matter do we know of any neurophysiologist who has attempted to test Zeeman's nerve models.9 PARTIV. THEMATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS: GENERICITY AND ITS MISUSE 11. THE MEANING OF GENERICITY Our statement of Thorn's theorem involved the word 'most' (cf. Section 5). To translate this into more precise language, we must describe the idea of genericity. If X is a set of objects, we would like to talk about properties that hold for 'most' elements of X. What does this mean? There are at least two mathematical situations in which there exists a technically precise concept which, in the opinion of mathematicians, captures the intuition behind the word 'most*. The first such situation will not concern us here, and we only mention it</page><page sequence="68">184 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER for illustrative purposes. It is the case when a measure m is defined on the set X. That is, m assigns to certain sets A contained in X a non-negative number m(A), called the measure of A. If a property P(x) holds for all elements x of X, with the exception of those x that belong to a set of measure zero, then we say that P holds for almost every x in X. We now describe the second situation, which is the one that interests us. The reader who so wishes may skip the technical paragraph that follows, and proceed directly to the examples, from which he will get a clear under standing of genericity. Formally, suppose that X is a topological space which has the Baire property (i.e. every countable intersection of open dense sets is dense). A property P(x) is said to be generic if it holds for all elements x of a set A which is a countable intersection of open dense sets. The technical reason why this definition is chosen cannot and need not be explained here. The important points behind it are, however, quite easy to explain. To say that a property P is generic means two things: (a) that every x, whether or not it satisfies P, can be approximated as close as desired by objects for which P holds, and (b) that the set of objects x for which P holds is quite thick. EXAMPLES. (1) Let S be the set of all real numbers. Let P be the property of being nonzero. That is, P holds for x if and only if x =? 0. Then P is generic. Indeed, if x is any number, then there are, arbitrarily close to x, numbers y that are nonzero (this is true even if x is itself zero). Moreover, the set of nonzero numbers is 'quite thick', since it is open (i.e. if x is nonzero, there is a whole interval about x all whose elements are nonzero). We express the fact that P is generic by a statement such as: 'a generic real number is nonzero', or 'generically, real numbers are different from zero'. (2) A generic curve C in two- or three-dimensional space is not a straight line. Indeed, any curve whatsover, whether or not it is straight, can be made non-straight by just perturbing it a little. Also, if a curve is not straight, it is not possible to make it straight by an arbitrarily small perturbation. (3) Fix a straight line L in the plane. Consider the properties P, Q of curves in the plane defined by: (a) C has P if C crosses L, and (b) C has Q if C does not cross L. A curve C which does not cross L cannot be changed into one that does by an arbitrarily small perturbation. Hence Pis not generic. Now take a curve Cthat crossesL, e.g. a straight line perpendicular to L. Any curve which is very close to Cwill also</page><page sequence="69">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 185 cross L. So C cannot be changed, by a small perturbation, into a curve that satisfies Q. So Q is not generic either. The preceding discussion should make it clear that (I) Genericity is not a property of individual objects, but a property of properties. Despite the informal language of the quotes above, it does not make sense to say that a given point in space, or a plane curve, is generic. A property of points, or of curves, could be generic. (II) The intuitive content of genericity is as follows: to say that 'property P is generic' is to say that 'not having Pis a very exceptional occurrence', that 'most objects have P\ We are now able to give a precise statement of the classification theorem of Thorn, for the case of two control parameters (cf. Section 5). The theorem asserts that, in the space F of all infinitely differentiable functions fia, ?; x), a certain property P is generic. The property P is defined as follows: fhas P if the critical set off is a surface all of whose points are either ordinary points, folds, or cusps. (Since the concept of genericity, to be meaningful, requires a topology on F, we must indicate which topology is being used. It is the C?? Whitney topology. We omit the definition, and refer the reader to Golubitsky and Guillemin (1974a), or to Sussmann (1975a), for more details. Sussmann (1975a) contains a much more extensive explanation of the intuitive meaning of genericity.) 12. GENERICITY MISUSED Genericity, as defined in Section 11, is a very precise mathematical concept. In Catastrophe Theory, however, it is subject to constant misuse. The main source of the misuse comes from talking as though genericity were a property of objects, rather than of properties. As an example, consider the war model (cf. Section 6). It deals with a function P(a, ?, x) of three variables. It is assumed that P satisfies certain 'sociological hypotheses', as well as the technical mathematical condition of smoothness. Moreover, it is assumed that Pis generic (Hypothesis 1). Now, as we indicated in Section 11, a property of functions can be generic, but it does not make sense to assume that a single function is. In the particular case of the war model, Isnard and Zeeman explain in a footnote</page><page sequence="70">186 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER that genericity means that "P is transverse to the natural stratification", and that "smooth generic Fs are open and dense in the space of all smooth Fs, which are dense in the space of all continuous Fs. Therefore any continuous P can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a smooth generic P, justifying the use of smooth generic P". The preceding quotation shows that, in this case, Isnard and Zeeman have selected one generic property 0* of functions ? the property of being transverse to the natural stratification of the space of functions ? and, when they say "P is generic", they mean 'P has ^'. Therefore, at least in this case, the Isnard?Zeeman use of the word is unambiguous. We shall see later that this is often not the case. But first let us concentrate on the second half of the quotation. This is as good a justification as any that can be found in the Catastrophe Theory literature for assuming that all functions in sight are smooth and generic. The argument is that every function can be approxi mated arbitrarily closely by functions that have the generic property. Why this is a justification we are not told, but it is not difficult to imagine the reason: if a particular P happened not to have property 0&gt;, it would be possible to approximate P by another P' that does have 0*. In particular, we could choose P' so close to P that the difference between them is smaller than the minimum distance we can discern. Hence there would really be no way for us to tell that the function is P, rather than P', so we might as well assume that the function isP'. Though the preceding justification has a certain ring of plausibility, a loose use of the reasoning by genericity can lead to all kinds of absurdities. First, observe that the Isnard?Zeeman quotation is self-contradictory. Indeed, within the class of continuous functions, the class of nowhere smooth ones is generic, and the class of smooth ones is not. So, if there is a valid reason for assuming P generic, once it has been assumed to be smooth, there is an equally valid reason for assuming that P is not smooth, once it has been assumed continuous. Second, the method, if pushed too far, can be used to establish that nothing whatsoever is the case. Indeed, take any event at all, such as the fact that yesterday I got up at 8:00 a.m. Let T be the time when I got up yesterday. Appealing to genericity, we can justify assuming that T is not 8:00 a.m., since the property T =5^8:00 a.m.' is generic. In fact, we can justify assuming that T?= f, no matter what T is, since, for any particular T,</page><page sequence="71">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 187 the property "T7^ 71" is generic. So, actually, we can justify assuming that I did not get up at all! As another example of the absurdities one can 'prove' if the idea of genericity is misused, consider the following situation. A material body B is located in space. The position p(t) of the center of mass is a (vector) function of the time t. Clearly, B moves if p(t) changes as t changes, and B is at rest if p is constant. Now, within the class of all vector functions/?, the nonconstant ones are dense. Hence, we can 'prove', via genericity, that p is not constant. We have 'proved', by pure thought, that nothing can be at rest! Though some readers may feel that the conclusion is probably true, in some sense, this is certainly too cheap a way of establishing it! The mathematical fallacy that underlies the preceding 'proofs' is easy to understand. Recall that the standard justification for assuming genericity is that every P can be approximated arbitrarily closely by generic ones. "To show that P has property St, we might as well assume P to be generic, since in any case one can find a P/, arbitrarily close to P, such that P' is generic." However, this justification only works if the property St is closed, in the sense that the set of objects that satisfy St is closed. For such a property, if we prove that St holds for generic points P, it follows that it holds for all P. Now consider the property St of curves p defined as follows: the curve t -&gt; p(t) has St if and only if p is a nonconstant curve. It is clear that St is not closed, since any constant curve can be approximated by nonconstant ones. 12.1. Primary Waves in Embryology, or How to Prove, by Pure Thought, that Everything Moves In Section 12 we illustrated, by means of two examples, the dangers of misusing the idea of genericity. The 'proofs' that I did not get up at 8:00 a.m., and that everything moves, are clearly incorrect, and the mathematical fallacy on which they depend is completely transparent. 'So', the reader must be thinking, 'these proofs are only presented here to show that the idea of genericity has to be used more carefully, but surely no Catastrophist is capable of going to the extreme of actually proving, by pure thought, that everything moves!' However, Catastrophe Theory can produce the impossible, and we shall now present an account of how Zeeman has succeeded in proving motion by pure thought. In his paper on 'Primary and Secondary Waves in Developmental Biology'</page><page sequence="72">188 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER (1974c, henceforth referred to as PSW), Zeeman 'proves' that, when homogeneous tissue of an embryo differentiates into two kinds separated by a frontier, then the frontier moves and deepens until it stabilizes. We quote in full what Zeeman labels as the Main Theorem of this 94-page long paper. MAIN THEOREM. Homeostasis, continuity, differentiation and repeatability imply the existence of a primary wave. In other words, a frontier forms, moves and deepens, then slows up and stabilizes, and finally deepens further. The 'theorem' deals with the following situation: one is given a substratum that consists of large number of objects located in space (e.g. cells). It is assumed that this substratum differentiates, i.e. that initially all the cells are of the same kind, while some time later they are of two different kinds. The motion of the frontier between the two types is what Zeeman calls a 'primary wave'. The 'proof of the main theorem is given in pp. 85 to 92 of PSW. It consists of, first assuming that the cells have a state space X which models their biochemistry. Without loss of generality, X can be assumed to be one-dimensional. (Remark: this is probably the only step in the 'proof that can be given a sound justification.) Space is assumed to be one-dimensional. The word 'homeostasis' is translated by assuming that the dynamics of the cell is described by a potential fit, s, x) which depends on time t, position s, and the internal state x. The cell is assumed to seek to locally minimize /, and to obey the delay rule. The word 'continuity' is translated by assuming that / is smooth. 'Differentiation' is translated into the assumption that, for the initial time tQ, the value of x that minimizes f(t0,s,x) is more or less the same for all s whereas, for large t, there are two kinds of cells, namely, those with small x and those with large x Figure 22 conveys all this information. From this Zeeman concludes that the critical set has the shape shown in figure 23. This conclusion is derived by a series of steps. First, the repeatability hypothesis is translated into 'genericity', which implies that the critical set has only cusps and folds as its singularities. Second, 'continuity' is given a new meaning, which somehow implies that there is only one cusp. Zeeman's precise words are: A single cusp would be sufficient. Moreover, a single cusp is qualitatively the simplest solution of the extension problem, and we can justify the simplest solution by again</page><page sequence="73">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 189 Fig. 23.</page><page sequence="74">190 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Fig. 24. appealing to Hypothesis II, continuity; in other words, we assume minimal discontinuity subject to Hypothesis III, differentiation. A new piece of hocus-pocus is now needed to explain why the shape of Figure 23 is chosen, rather than that of Figure 24. Here 'repeatability' is appealed to again. Figure 24, we are told, "is exceptional, because the time-axis at the cusp point c0 coincides with the cusp axis. Hypothesis IV, repeatability, forbids this exceptional situation'. Next, we must know why Figure 23 rather than Figure 25, i.e. why there must exist a point c2 where the bifurcation curve becomes parallel to the time axis. Nothing 'exceptional' seems to happen in Figure 25, so Zeeman solves his problem by the same method used in proving the main theorem of the war paper: what cannot be proved is just asserted with conviction. In this case, Zeeman simply says (PSW, p. 89) that "as the two branches of the cusp widen out, there will be a unique first point c2 (on the branch for which t is greater) where the tangent is parallel to the time-axis". Finally, it would be nice to know why Figure 23 rather than Figure 26. (Notice that in Figure 26 to lower sheet slopes upwards as t increases, and moves closer to the upper sheet.) Here the problem is simply ignored, although it is quite important, as we shall see. Zeeman then shows how Figure 23 yields the conclusions of his 'theorem'.</page><page sequence="75">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 191 Fig. 25. A frontier that does not stabilize, even though it is consistent with all the hypotheses of Zeeman's Theorem. Shown in Figure 23 are the development paths of five cells A, B, C, D, E. The path of A proceeds smoothly into the lower sheet. All the paths are smooth up to time f j. After this time, there will be jumps. For instance, B jumps at time tB, and Cat the later time tc. Hence the frontier between the two kinds of tissue describes the ?curve cxc2 in space-time. Once c2 is reached, no more switchings occur, since the path of a point such as E will proceed smoothly to the upper sheet. So, at time t2, the frontier stabilizes at c2. Finally, that the frontier deepens is shown by the fact that the distance between the lower sheet and the upper sheet increases. This 'proof of Zeeman's is spurious for a large number of reasons. Let us quote just a few. First, because it is a 'proof by choice of meaning', in that, as part of the proof, meanings are chosen for the terms involved. Second, because the meanings that are chosen actually vary during the proof (Example: 'continuity' is used twice, with different meanings). Third, because the stabilization of the frontier is not proved at all, since it depends on the existence of the point c2, where the bifurcation curve is parallel to the t axis. As we pointed out before, the existence of c2 is not proved, and it does not</page><page sequence="76">192 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Fig. 26. A frontier that does not deepen. follow even if the rest of Zeeman's framework is accepted, Fourth, the deepening of the frontier is not proved either, and it does not follow, as shown by the fact that Figure 26 is possible. A lot more could be said about this proof, and the reader who wishes to pursue the subject should read PSW. Here, we shall concentrate on one point which we have reserved for the end: the 'proof that the frontier moves: The frontier moves because Figure 24 is excluded. Figure 24 is excluded because it is exceptional, and the repeatability hypothesis forbids exceptional situations. The repeatability hypothesis forbids exceptional situations because Zeeman chose to interpret the hypothesis this way.</page><page sequence="77">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 193 The situation of Figure 24 is exceptional because Zeeman chose to interpret the word 'exceptional' this way. So, if we translate back into English, and eliminate all the intermediate 'Mathematics', which is irrelevant anyhow, we are left with the following restatement of Zeeman's result, and of its proof: THEOREM. If nothing exceptional happens, then the frontier moves. Proof. If it did not move, that would be quite exceptional. By hypothesis, exceptional things do not happen. Hence it moves. Q.E.D. The reader should notice that, when so restated, there is nothing in the theorem that forces us to restrict ourselves to frontiers of tissues. The same method of proof applies to anything whatsoever. So, as promised, we find that we have deduced, by pure thought, that everything moves (except for those exceptional objects which, at exceptional times, do not). PART V. A FINAL ASSESSMENT 13. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES We shall discuss, rather briefly, a number of issues which have not been touched upon in the preceding sections. 1. The hypotheses of the ACT models. Most ACT models of Zeeman and coworkers are presented as though they were based on reasonable hypotheses from which, by means of mathematical reasoning, conclusions are drawn which say something significant about the phenomenon under study. We have already analyzed the quality of the mathematical reasoning (cf. also item 6 below) and, for the dog aggression and nerve impulse models, we have evaluated the conclusions. But, what about the hypotheses? Are they, at least, reasonable? Examination of the models shows that, in most cases, they are not. Consider, for instance, the Isnard?Zeeman war model. We have already listed, in Section 6, their four 'sociological hypotheses'. Are they plausible? Hypothesis 3 says that, "if the cost is high, and the threat moderate, then opinion will be split between doves and hawks". Hypothesis 2</page><page sequence="78">194 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL.S..ZAHLER says that "if the cost is low, then opinion will be unified, and the greater the threat, the greater will be the level of military action called for". There is no doubt that Hypothesis 3 is quite reasonable. Let us examine why. If a country is under 'moderate threat', then there will be some people that will want to take action and go to war, while others will oppose it. One thing that nobody will want ? except for traitors and suicides ? is to go to war but with such a small military force that the enemy will surely crush it. If the people of country A believe that the minimum size of the military force needed to defeat country B is 100 000 soldiers, then some will be in favor of sending 100 000 soldiers, others of sending none at all, but few will want to send 20 000 soldiers to a sure defeat. In other words, you either want war or not, but if you want it, then you want to make the minimum necessary effort. This is why public opinion is polarized. But, once this is seen, we realize that the cost has little to do with the polarization. The reasons we just gave apply equally well whether the cost is high or low. War vs. no war is a discrete set of alternatives.10 So Hypothesis 2, which postulates a unified public opinion, collapses. And this is, indeed, as it should be. Suppose that country A can wage war against country B quite cheaply, and country B becomes increasingly threatening. Hypothesis 2 says that, as the threat grows, public opinion will be unified in favor of a level x of military action. Moreover, x will increase continuously as the threat increases. In reality, however, something quite different will happen. Some people will wish to attack country B; others will not. The larger the threat becomes, the stronger the feeling will be in favor of war. But never will there be a unified public opinion supporting the sending of only 100 soldiers to be massacred. The preceding objection is quite important. If Hypothesis 2 is removed, and replaced by the more reasonable one that, at all levels of cost and threat, public opinion is divided between doves and hawks, then there is no longera cusp surface. The behavior set now consists of two surfaces, one on top of the other. The resulting theory is probably reasonable ? at least, it is better than the Isnard?Zeeman model, since it captures the fact that war ? no war is a genuinely discrete variable ? but it has nothing to do with Catastrophe Theory any more. There are, of course, many other reasons why the Isnard?Zeeman hypotheses are wrong. For instance, the Delay Rule implies that, if public opinion gradually shifts from hawkish to dovish, the administration's</page><page sequence="79">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 195 response will follow but with a delay, i.e. for a while the administration will be 'stuck' with an unpopular policy of war. But the Delay Rule also operates the other way. If public opinion shifts from dovish to hawkish, the administration's response will be delayed, and the administration will be stuck with an unpopular policy of peace even after most people want war. Isnard and Zeeman do not state this as consequence of their model (although it follows in exactly the same way as the first consequence). It is not hard to understand why. History presents us with many cases of administrations that stubbornly refused to end a war despite the fact that the majority of the population wanted it ended ? e.g. Russia in World War I and, possibly, the U.S. in Vietnam ? but with few cases of governments that refused to go to war despite strong pressure by public opinion. The reader will have no difficulty finding many more such objections. Moreover, the same can be done with most of the other models, and we shall omit the details. 2. Spurious quantification. The idea that anything we talk about can somehow be made into a numerical variable is one of the most pervasive diseases of contemporary science. Andreski (1973a), p. 130, writes that to describe what people do to one another we employ words like 'form', 'structure', or 'relation* (taken from the crafts of pottery, masonry and basketry) because we have nothing better, but we should beware of imagining that social phenomena offer anything but the vaguest analogy to the things or physical operations for which these words were first coined. To take another example; when we talk about status being higher or lower, we are entitled to use the latter words only in a purely metaphoric sense; and should beware of making a gratuitous assumption that the multifarious behaviour which we label as the relations of status is in fact amenable to a univocal linear ordering within which every individual must have a precise location. The assumption about the linearity of status seldom holds even for a pecking order of a few hens; because even there we often find such a situation that A pecks B, B pecks C, and C pecks A, not to speak of even more convoluted permutations. The basic point is that you cannot convert vague and dubious approximations (not to speak of nonsense and half-truths) into a mathematical science simply by transcribing them into the symbolism of mathematics. Not even the most powerful theorems of today's mathematics could be of any help in an attempt to make aristotelian physics into an exact science. The principle that 'nature abhors a vacuum' was a valuable idea at the time, even useful for practical purposes such as making pumps, but no amount of juggling with symbols could convert it into a proposition of mathematical physics.</page><page sequence="80">196 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER In Catastrophe Theory we find a very acute case of the disease of spurious quantification. Expressions such as 'aggression level' are made into numerical variables. We have already described the consequences of manufacturing a continuous numerical variable out of such a concept. Let us add here that the same is even true of many variables that seem quantifiable at first sight, such as the 'cost' of the war. In reality, there are all kinds of'costs', and there are at least two that are completely different conceptually. One is expected cost, i.e. how much people think a war might cost. The other one isactual cost, i.e. how much the war is actually costing, if there is a war. The two are so different that they vary in opposite ways in their relation to level of military activity. If there is no war, then the higher the expected cost the less willing people are likely to be to go to war (other things being equal). So expected cost and level of military activity, if correlated at all, are likely to be inversely correlated. Actual cost, however, is directly correlated with level of military activity, i.e. once there is war, the higher the military activity, the higher its cost. In fact, even expected cost and actual cost are very complex, imprecise aggregates. To lump all these into one variable is unacceptable and confusing. The same is true of the 'threat'. Actually, one of the most serious reasons why there is often polarization of public opinion into hawks and doves is that the perceived threat varies from person to person. Hawks are, mostly, those who think the threat is high, while those who believe that the threat is low are most likely to be doves. Even if the threat perceived by each individual were a quantifiable variable ? which is not clear at all ? the aggregation of all these threats into one number is inadmissible for a model that pretends to deal with the polarization of public opinion. It is as though one attempted to make a model of social unrest using 'income' as a variable, and aggregating all income into one variable, without looking into how income is distributed. A phenomenon parallel to spurious quantification is spurious functional ization, i.e. the translation of everyday English statements into functional relationships between variables. For instance, one could translate the sentence 'older people are wiser' into mathematics, by writing (*) w =/(*), da</page><page sequence="81">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 197 where a is age and w is wisdom. Of course, nothing is gained, and much is lost, in such a translation. The formal equation (*) has a rigidity to it that is absent from the English sentence. Is / the same function for all people? Surely not, since many young people are wiser than many old ones. Is / a different function for each individual? Even this is doubtful, for then (*) would be asserting that each person grows wiser as he grows older, a statement to which counterexamples abound. But, even if we assume that this is indeed what (*) asserts, one could only conclude that (*) is a good description of how age and wisdom are related for a single individual. When many individuals are present, there is no way to infer anything about the relationship between age and wisdom for the group. For instance, the possibility that (*) holds for each person (but with person-dependent f) is consistent with the existence of a negative correlation between a and w for a group (e.g. if each generation starts off at a higher level of wisdom than the one that preceded it). Spurious functionalization remains spurious if strict functional relations such as w =f(a) are replaced by slightly more general relationships, such as allowing the curve of w as a function of a to have folds, or cusps if w is a function of two variables. In the Catastrophe Theory models, spurious functionalization occurs throughout. A dog's aggression level is a 'function' (which is bimodal at certain points) of its fear and rage. Is the 'function' the same for each dog, as time passes? Does it change in time? The former possibility looks quite implausible, since it assumes a rigid relationship between stimuli and response, not dependent on other factors. If, on the other hand, the 'function' does change in time, then the model says nothing, since (a) every point in space is contained in some cusp surface, (b) different observations of the same dog will be at different times. Hence one never has more than one point per dog at each time and, if we allow a different cusp surface at each time, we can always fit one. Notice, however, that planes, paraboloids, or Peano curves would do the job equally well. It is quite suggestive that, in the only model where some attempt is made to analyze actual data, Zeeman and his coauthors are forced to assume a moving cusp (cf. Zeeman et. al., 1976b). The model is supposed to describe prison riots. Zeeman et al plot a number of observations of 'tension' and 'alienation' at a British prison, and try to show that the points plotted fall in</page><page sequence="82">198 H?CTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER the region between the branches of the bifurcation curve of a cusp. Since the points do not fall in such a region ? inspection of the picture shows clearly that the points fall in the region between two parallel lines - the usual sleight-of-hand is performed. Suddenly, it is decided that there is not one but two cusps, i.e. that the cusp must have moved! (cf. Figure 3 of Zeeman et ah, 1976b, and its caption, where it is explained that "the movement of the cusp may represent a higher tolerance level of tension in the institution after the first mass protest".) In p. 129 of his book, Andreski writes that "to give a physical analogy of what passes for mathematical sociology, one would have to put into a mathematical formula statements like 'if you bang them hard enough, most things crack up'." Of course, Andreski is being sarcastic. Hardly could he imagine, in 1972, that a few years later a theory would be hailed for using mathematics to make predictions such as that "a frightened dog, if it is placed in a situation in which rage steadily increases, may suddenly attack". (Zeeman 1976a, p. 67.) 3. Qualitative vs. Quantitative. The Catastrophe Theorists repeatedly assert that their theory is qualitative rather than quantitative. This, in their view, is a good thing, flowever, there is ? according to them - a general prejudice in the scientific community against purely qualitative reasoning, and this explains why so many scientists are unsympathetic to CT. (For examples of this, cf. Section 10 of the Isnard?Zeeman paper, or Thorn 1974b, p. 388.) We do not know if there is such a prejudice against qualitative reasoning. Even if it exists, we do not share it. Darwin's theory of evolution, Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, C. Wright Mills' theory of the power elite, psychoanalysis, are examples of great pieces of qualitative theorizing. However, qualitative theories, like quantitative ones, can be good or bad, right or wrong. Just the fact that you are 'reasoning qualitatively' does not suffice to make you right. Zeeman's dog aggression model predicts that a non-frightened dog, if enraged, will not attack. The war model predicts that a country that can wage war cheaply will not suddenly attack, no matter how threatened. Zeeman's stock market model predicts that a purely speculative market cannot crash. These predictions are simply wrong, and the question of whether they are qualitative or quantitative is just irrelevant. We criticize them because they are wrong, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The</page><page sequence="83">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 199 reader is encouraged to go through this paper and look for examples of objections that we raise that consist of "criticizing Catastrophe Theory because it is qualitative rather than quantitative". He will not find any. On the other hand, it is quite ironic that ACT should employ such a line of defense. As we showed before, ACT repeatedly perpetrates what we called 'spurious quantification', i.e. the transformation of imprecise everyday concepts into numerical variables. ACT turns 'rage', 'threat', 'fear' into real-valued variables. It even turns clearly discrete ones - such as aggression ? into continuous ones. And then, after this orgy of spurious quantification, it pristinely calls itself 'qualitative'. Catastrophe Theory performs a disservice to those who wish to develop a science of the qualitative. In practice, ACT uses the words 'qualitative reasoning' as an excuse for faulty reasoning. If one can claim the right to freely choose and change the meanings of words within an argument, and if one defends this by claiming that the reasoning is only qualitative, it follows that 'qualitative' is being equated to 'anything goes'. We do not believe that this is the meaning of 'qualitative', and we do not believe that, because they are 'only being qualitative', Catastrophe Theorists should be relieved from the usual intellectual standards of rigor. 4. Local vs. Global. A very large part of mathematics is concerned with the local properties of certain objects, such as functions, curves, or surfaces. Local properties are those that have to do with the behavior in arbitrarily small neighborhoods. Continuity, differentiability, are local properties. Now, quite often, objects that have very different local properties are indistin guishable at the macroscopic level, i.e. look exactly alike to the naked eye. A constant function, and a periodic function that has a very small period and a very small amplitude will be, for all practical purposes, identical from the macroscopic point of view. Global theories have to do with what is visible to the naked eye. Though much of mathematics is local, it is safe to state that most mathematics that can be applied deals with global properties. Local properties matter inasmuch as they can somehow be 'integrated' to yield global ones. For instance, if we know of a function fit) that it is differentiable, this tells us nothing. We could know the values of /at several pointe ti, .. ., tk, and the value at some other point T can still be anything we please. On the other hand, if we know that / satisfies the local condition</page><page sequence="84">200 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER then we can get global information about / For instance, if we know that f(2) = 3, then we can be sure that /(4) is at least 3. The differential equations that govern planetary motion in Newton's theory of gravitation are local, but one can extract global information from them (e.g. that orbits are in first approximation, conic sections). Only this information can be compared with what the naked eye can see. When a phenomenon is modelled by a system of differential equations (as is often done in physics, engineering and biology), the success of the model depends on the global information that can be extracted from it. For instance, if we know that the system has at least one stable equilibrium, (a local property) this says little unless we have some idea of the size of the domain of attraction of the equilibrium. The mathematics of Catastrophe Theory is purely local. Its main theorem refers exclusively to the local behavior of certain functions and surfaces. From a knowledge that a curve or surface satisfies the conclusions of Thorn's theorem, it is not possible to infer anything global about such curve or surface. For instance, the curves (A), (B), (C) of Figure 27 would look exactly alike to the naked eye if the parameters p, q, r were made small enough. Yet, in Thorn's theory, these curves are quite different. (A) is 'exceptional', and does not satisfy the conclusions of the theorem (actually, it is not even smooth) while (B) and (C) are nice and 'generic'. From the local knowledge that the only singularities of a curve are folds, nothing global can be inferred about it. If we wish to make global inferences we must either have some global information, or else some local information that can be integrated to yield global conclusions. But, once we have such knowledge, the fact that the only singularities are folds ceases to matter. These considerations are important, because the fact that CT is only local suffices to invalidate most of its uses and, in particular, the claim that CT has something significant to say about discontinuous behavior. In a neighborhood U of a cusp point P, it is true that a path in the control plane will give rise to a path in the cusp surface that exhibits a jump. It is also true that, in a neighborhood of P, the size of the jump will increase as we move away from the singularity. However, U can be very small, and there is no reason why,</page><page sequence="85">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 201 *P (A) (B) (c) Fig. 27. after we leave U, the distance between the two sheets of the cusp surface should grow significantly. If it does not grow above a threshold that is perceptible by the naked eye, then the jump will be undetectable and, for all practical purposes, there will be no discontinuous behavior. The mathematical jump that appears in CT models is a local phenomenon, which has little in common with observed jumps (cf. Section 9). 5. Alternatives. The claim is sometimes made that Catastrophe Theory, despite its defects, is the first step towards the development of a mathematical theory of discontinuous phenomena. Whatever its short comings, it is said, it is the only tool we have got. Defending Catastrophe Theory this way is like defending the proposal to use chicken soup as a cure for appendicitis, by means of the argument that 'it may not be a very good method, but we have nothing better'. Of course, (a)</page><page sequence="86">202 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER we do have something better, and (b) even if we did not, that does not suffice to establish that chicken soup is any good as a cure for appendicitis. That Catastrophe Theory is not a very good cure has been clearly shown in the preceding pages. Let us show, briefly that, even for the situations discussed by Zeeman, simple-minded classical mathematics (at the high-school level) can do much better than the cusp catastrophe. Consider, again, the war model, and let us assume that we accept Zeeman's choice of variables. Instead of Zeeman's 'sociological hypotheses', make the following basic assumption: there is a 'threshold value' x, which represents the level of military activity perceived by the people of country A as the minimum needed to defeat country B. The variable x is exogenous, and it can change (for instance, if it is found out that Z?'s military defenses are better than had been believed, then x goes up). The maximum acceptable level x of military activity is a function of cost, threat, and as many other variables as the reader may wish to include. The actual level x of military activity is determined by x-x if x&gt;x x = 0 if x&lt;x (i.e. if the government is willing to go along with at least as much effort as is needed, then there will be war. Otherwise, there will not). Such a 'model' is, of course, very poor. Its choice of variables (cost, threat) is very bad, as we pointed out when discussing Zeeman's model. It leaves out other factors, such as strength of desire to go to war. (These factors could be incorporated by adding more variables.) However, our only purpose here is to show that this model is better than Zeeman's. (a) Our model is more natural. The mechanism creating the discontinuity in our 'model' is precisely the one that is responsible for the discontinuity in reality, i.e. that nobody wants to wage war with fewer forces than are needed to win. (b) Absurd behavior that is predicted by Zeeman's model is absent from ours. In Zeeman's model, a country that can wage war cheaply will never attack suddenly, no matter how threatened. In ours, it will. The reader can decide which conclusion is better, (c) In our model, war vs. no war is a genuinely discontinuous variable, while Zeeman's model artifically makes it continuous, (d) Our model can explain continuous escalation better than Zeeman's. In our model, there will be</page><page sequence="87">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 203 continuous escalation if x rises gradually, starting from a small value. In Zeeman's model, to get continuous escalation, it must be the case that the threat posed by the enemy increases steadily, while the cost of war remains small. The most recent example of continuous escalation is the U.S. participation in the Vietnam war. The explanation provided by our model is as follows: the reason for the continuous escalation is that, initially, it was believed that a small American force would suffice (i.e. x was small). As the war progressed, it became clear that American involvement, to be successful, had to be much larger than was originally believed, i.e. x rose. The explanation provided by Zeeman's model is quite different: there was continuous escalation because the cost was low, while the threat posed by the enemy rose steadily. Again, the reader can judge by himself which explanation is better. The point of the preceding threshold model is, very simply, that (a) discontinuous behavior can be described mathematically in simple ways and (b) such descriptions are much better than the one provided by the cusp models. Our conclusion, although illustrated by one example, has a wide range of validity. For instance, a similar analysis can be performed for the dog aggression model. We start from the observation that animal A will not attack animal B in such a way that retaliation by B is certain to hurt A badly (e.g. a dog A will not jump at another dog B, and sink its teeth one millimeter deep into B's skin, having achieved nothing but getting B angry.) If A attacks, it will do it all the way. Hence, attack is a discrete, zero-one variable. A continuous variable p, the probability of attack, can be introduced, and made into a function of rage and fear. The behavior that results is obvious. This model compares favorably with Zeeman's in that it predicts that attack will always be a discontinuous phenomenon whereas, in Zeeman's model, a nonfrightened dog, if angered, will increase its aggression level continuously. (A Catastrophist may object that our model does not exhibit 'divergence'. But, until evidence is provided by him that divergence actually occurs in the behavior of dogs, this is not a valid objection.) Our model is actually an accurate rendering of what Lorenz says in his book on aggression. In p. 93, Lorenz discusses a diagram he has presented in p. 92, in which various facial expressions of a dog are shown, corresponding to different values of rage and fear. Fear increases vertically downward, and rage increases as we move from</page><page sequence="88">204 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER left to right. Lorenz writes: If the opinion we have formed from situation analysis and movement analysis is correct and the right-hand upper dog is only angry and hardly afraid, attack but almost never flight will follow the expression movement depicted. If it is correct that, in the center dog, anger and fear are almost equally mixed, this expression will be followed by attack in half the cases and by flight in the other half. Tinbergen and his collaborators made numerous motivation analyses on suitable objects, particularly on the threatening movements of sea-gulls, and the conformity of agreement from these three sources has convincingly proved, on the broadest statistical basis, the correctness of their conclusions. It is clear from this quotation ? and from a reading of all of Chapter 6 of 'On Aggression' ? that Lorenz clearly distinguishes between the discon tinuous variable 'attack-flight' and continuous variables such as rage and fear. The value of the discontinuous variable ? i.e. the outcome ? is random, its probability being a function of rage and fear. No mysterious 'continuous spectrum of modes of behavior' is mentioned. In an effort to force the cusp into animal aggression, Zeeman seems to have misread his main source. 6. A remark on mathematical rigor. The reader who still believes that it may be possible to rescue some of the 'proofs' that were discussed earlier ? perhaps by rewriting them more carefully, and stating the theorems less vaguely ? is advised to consider the following piece, taken from Zeeman (1974c) COROLLARY 1. Initially, when the frontier first moves, it is moving at constant speed. Proof. The path of the wave is the branch cx c% of the cusp, which, near cx, to first order, can be replaced by the tangent at cx. The 'frontier' referred to here is the frontier of the wave, as we described in Section 12. The reader may observe that the 'Corollary' would apply equally well to anything that moves along a differentiable curve, and not just at the initial point, but at every point. So Zeeman is actually 'proving' that everything moves at constant velocity (that everything moves was 'proved' in Section 12). The reader who believes in the existence of nonconstant velocities is invited to find the fallacy in Zeeman's proof.11 Notice also that, in the surrealistic world of Catastrophe Theory, everything can be proved, even things that have been disproved. For instance,</page><page sequence="89">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 205 one can prove: initially the frontier is moving at nonconstant velocity. ('Proof: by genericity, the acceleration at the initial time is not zero, since it would be exceptional if it were. Hence the velocity changes.) We leave it as an exercise for the reader to prove that, initially, the frontier is not moving at all, even though it was 'proved' in Section 12 that it is. (Hint: use the fact that the trajectory is continuous, and replace it, initially, to zeroth order approximation, by a constant function.) 7. The benefit of the doubt. Many of the proposed Catastrophe Theory models could be (and have been) defended from criticisms like ours, by attempting to rearrange meanings. For instance, one could argue that Zeeman probably did not mean his 'aggression level' in the dog model to be a behavioral variable, but a dispositional one, e.g. probability of attack, or strength of urge to attack. Each defense of this kind can be countered by showing that, under the new proposed interpretation, the model does not make any more sense than it did before. But then a new reinterpretation can be proposed,... and the game can proceed indefinitely. A critic cannot consider all possible reinterpretations, especially when the subject matter of the discussion is a universe in which, as we showed earlier, the authors of the models grant themselves the freedom to assign to each word, at each time, whichever meaning may best suit the purpose at hand. Humpty Dumpty's choices of meaning, despite their strangeness, were at least consistent. To the proponents of reinterpretations of what may have been meant, one may reply by paraphrasing Humpty Dumpty's remark to Alice: "if he'd meant that, he'd have said it". On the other hand, a case could be made that one ought not to be inflexible, and reject any piece of intellectual speculation just because the author did not make himself clear. This is true, but one has to reject some pieces of speculation for that reason, or else we would fall in the opposite extreme of accepting anything whatsover, provided only that it is ambiguous and vague. Neither extreme is good so, as usual, the question is where to draw the line, i.e. how much the benefit of the doubt can be granted to an author. This is why, in this paper, we have emphasized so strongly the mathematical aspects of ACT. There, at least, the case is clear-cut. A student of mathematics would not pass a Calculus course if he writes something like 'Corollary 1' and its 'proof, as quoted above. If no benefit of doubt is given</page><page sequence="90">206 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER to him, there is no reason why it should be given to a Professor of Mathematics, however famous. Nor is there a justification for giving the benefit of the doubt when the logical flaws, the inconsistencies and vaguenesses are (a) present throughout and (b) essential ingredients without which the main points being proposed cease to be valid. 8 Why the success? The great success that Catastrophe Theory seems to have had is a phenomenon in need of an explanation, in view of our criticisms above. The interest it has aroused among the public at large is mostly understandable in terms of the fascination which the mystery of mathematics exerts upon the mathematically uneducated. Mathematics, in the perception of many, is like sorcery. The mathematician performs mysterious passes that others cannot understand, and suddenly a prediction, a theory, emerges. Consider, for instance, the description of how Catastrophe Theory works, as provided to its readers by Newsweek magazine (Jan. 19, 1976, pp. 54?55): To apply catastrophe theory, a mathematician first selects the variables that are relevant to his problem - these might be 'growth' and 'inflation' in a particular economic environment. He then compiles as much statistical and behavioral data as possible and takes stock of the extraneous factors that might influence the economic climate. Finally, using highly complex mathematics and a computer, the mathematician forms a qualitative and quantitative model that, if properly formulated, can make precise forecasts of behavior which Zeeman says are far superior to any that can be achieved with the best statistical techniques known. The image presented here of the mathematician at work is very much like that of a sorcerer. The statistical data and the computer replace, the wand and the flowing robes, but the actual nature of the mathematician's activity is equally mysterious. As in the case of sorcerers who were supposed to have all kinds of powers, yet seldom were able to perform a specific, reproducible feat, the Catastrophist is supposed to be able to make "forecasts" that are "far superior to any that can be achieved with the best statistical techniques available", although not a single example of such a forecast exists. The intimidatory power that mathematics in general has over the nonmathematician is enhanced, in this case, by certain features of Catas trophe Theory that are exceptional even for mathematics, such as: (1) The claim to universality, since Catastrophe Theory, in the words of</page><page sequence="91">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 207 R. Thorn, is supposed to "offer far-reaching possibilities to attack the problem of the stability of self-reproducing structures, like living beings", and "the validity of this type of dynamics [sic] description exceeds by far the biological realm, and may be applied to all morphological processes ? whether animate or inanimate ? where discontinuities prohibit the use of classical quantitative models" (Thorn, 1969a, p. 89). Or, in Zeeman's words, "The method has the potential for describing the evolution of form in all aspects of nature, and hence it embodies a theory of great generality" (Zeeman, 1976a, p. 65). (2) The unusual nature of the mathematics utilized, which is very much unlike the kind of mathematics most nonmathematicians are acquainted with. It combines concepts that are completely inaccessible to anyone who is not a professional mathematician ? e.g. Whitney topology, genericity, structural stability, unfoldings ? with the use of some pictures of amazing simplicity ? e.g. the cusp surface. The mystificatory power of the combination is explosive: when confronted with a cusp surface ? which anyone can understand ? and the claim that, for "deep mathematical reasons" the surface explains why dogs attack, it is hard to resist. Those who demand an explanation will be told something like: "well, consider the natural stratification of the space of smooth families of functions... ", at which point even the most sophisticated physicist or engineer will prefer to give up. (3) The claim that known facts are explained by catastrophe theory, in fields ranging from aggression to stock exchanges, prison riots, embryology, ecology, censorship, evolution, linguistics, nerve impulses, and even the theory of literary symbolism. (4) The redundant accumulation of supportive statements. Write a paper stating an unsupported theory, and this will not cause the theory to be believed. Write a second paper in which you refer to the theory of the first as "well established", and the acceptance level will increase. Let a colleague of yours write a paper referring to your deep work and the level will rise still more. Multiply all this by two hundred, and you obtain something like Catastrophe Theory. By the time the whole thing reaches the average reader, it will be through articles in which the theory is taken for granted. The reader who wishes to pursue the matter further will be referred to more articles in which the same is done. Few will follow the thread all the way. Those few who do will require such an intellectual effort ? since they will have to learn</page><page sequence="92">208 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER all about maps and diffeomorphisms and singularities and stability ? that, when they reach the end and realize that the thread is not tied to any external evidence, but only to itself, it will be hard for them to accept the truth, and to acknowledge that their effort has been in vain. A good example of how truth is transformed into untruth by repetition is afforded by Zeeman's nerve impulse models. As was shown in Part III, the models make no predictions that compare favorably with those of Hodgkin and Huxley, and makes many that are far removed from what is found experimentally. Though Zeeman suggests some experiments that might test the theory, his suggestions are too vague to be carried out, and none have been, to this date (February, 1977). Yet, in 1972, R. Abraham wrote, referring to Zeeman's heartbeat and nerve impulse article: This is one of the most impressive applications of catastrophe theory, and it is well worthwhile to read Zeeman's paper. It is also a pioneer example of collaboration of mathematical and empirical morphologists, as Zeeman has recommended experiments suggested by his model, which have been performed, certifying his predictions.12 Finally, one important factor must be mentioned, namely (5) The impressive name given to the subject. 9. Catastrophe Theory and the Philosophy of Science. Although this paper is only concerned with the most popular version of Catastrophe Theory ? i.e. Zeeman's work ? it is important to give at least some idea of the philosophical views that underlie the theory. Explicit statements of these views are to be found mostly in the work of R. Thorn. The purpose of the following quotations is to present these views to the reader. It will be clear from them that Catastrophe Theory is an attempt to approach science by trying to impose a preconceived set of mathematical structures upon the world, rather then by means of the experimental method. Particular instances of this approach at work have been already described in this paper. The mysterious fact that the Catastrophists make such enormous efforts to fit cusp surfaces everywhere becomes less mysterious once this basic philo sophical attitude is understood. Ren? Thorn writes on Catastrophe Theory: There is no doubt it is on the philosophical plane that these models have the most immediate interest. They give the first rigorously monistic model of the living being, and</page><page sequence="93">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 209 they reduce the paradox of the soul and the body to a single geometrical object. Likewise on the plane of the biological dynamic, they combine causality and finality into one pure topological continuum, viewed from different angles. Of course this requires the abandonment of a universal mechanism and Laplacian determinism [and also of the experimental method, H. S. and R. Z.], but have these ever been anything but wishful thinking? Our models attribute all morphogenesis to conflict, a struggle between two or more attractors. This is the 2500 year old idea of the first presocratic philosophers, Anaximander and Heraclitus. They have been accused of primitive confusionism, because they used a vocabulary with human and social origins (conflict, injustice, etc.) to explain the appearance of the physical world, but I think that they were far from wrong because they had the following fundamentally valid intuition: the dynamical situations governing the evolution of natural phenomena are basically the same as those governing the evolution of man and societies, profoundly justifying the use of anthropomorphic words in physics. Inasmuch as we use the word 'conflict' to express a well-defined geometrical situation in a dynamical system, there is no objection to using the word \p describe quickly and qualitatively a given dynamical situation. When we geometrize also the words 'information', 'message' and 'plan', as our models are trying to do, any objection to the use of these terms is removed. And this will represent not a little progress for present-day molecular biology. (Thorn 1975a, pp. 323-324). As a general conclusion about CT in Biology, I feel that we should not hurry for any 'experimental confirmation', I think that a lot of theoretical thinking, of speculative modelling, has to be done before one might really start to experiment to make a choice between models. Even so, it is doubtful that these experiments would interest very much present biologists, as they would be unable to understand their motivation. Quite likely, there is very little which can be done about the present situation: I agree with P. Antonelli, when he states that theoretical biology should be done in Mathematical Departments; we have to let biologists busy themselves with their very concrete - but almost meaningless - experiments; in developmental Biology, how could they hope to solve a problem that they cannot even formulate? (Thorn, 1974b, p. 387). One senses in the preceding words an attitude of contempt by the pure thinker towards those busy themselves with almost meaningless tasks such as the deciphering of the genetic code, instead of undertaking the nobler task of discovering that "it is tempting to see the history of nations as a sequence of catastrophes between metabolic forms; what better example is there of a generalized catastrophe than the disintegration of a great empire, like Alexander's". (Thorn 1975a, p. 320). Such statements also give clues towards an understanding of why, as Thorn puts it, "this may cause ? among positivist minded scientists ? a 'backlash' reaction against Catastrophe Theory'. (Thorn 1974b, p. 387). But, for those mathematicians that are not 'positivist-minded', Thorn has a vision to offer, that of the mathematician's Platonic dreamworld, a world of pure ideas</page><page sequence="94">210 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER uncorrupted by the intrusion of treacherous facts. This is how Thorn describes his magnificent dream (we translate from the French, the source of Thorn, 1975b, pp. 372-373): In my view, scientific theorizing, in every discipline, necessarily involves the elimination of concepts, and their replacement by combinatorial constructions on forms. It is the extension to natural science of Hubert's program of the elimination of intuition in the axiomatization of Geometry. To fulfill such a program, a theory of Gestalten is needed, and the theory must be flexible enough to account formally for the deductive possibilities of usual language. The theory will therefore have to simulate the semantic universe of our languages, i.e. to give a model of it. So we are lead back to the dream of Leibniz' Characteristica Universalis (with the qualification that the Calculus of Forms could be a much more flexible operation than a simple algebraic calculus... ) Catastrophe Theory, inasmuch as it provides a theory of analogy, is undoubtedly a first step in that direction. It is not by chance that this theory is based, mathematically, on the idea of singularity ; a singularity, in fact, concentrates a global structure in one point, so that this concept is the ideal tool for the extension from the local to the global. Through this natural door, algebra enters the theorization, algebra also comes in from a different direction, to wit, the generating power of operations, the indefinite iteration of a calculation. If we look at things this way, there is a certain reemergence of the vitalistic idea of a subject capable of indefinitely repeating the same act without being affected. Hence, the appeal to the Calculus, which was supposed to eliminate all anthropomorphism, entails in fact a subtle reference to the permanence of the acting subject, for which there is nothing equivalent in the various natural dynamics. When man thus imposes the mathematical infinity upon the world, isn't he showing the same unconscious presumption as the primitive magician that commanded the Gods... ? In such optics of scientific explanation, all scientific theorising would be mathe matical, the concepts used in each discipline, not being susceptible of achieving a usage agreed upon by consensus ... would have to be progressively eliminated, once their heuristic role is fulfilled. In such a vision of science, only the mathematician, who knows how to characterize and generate stable, long-lasting forms, has the right %to use the (mathematical) concepts; ultimately, only he has the right to be intelligent. 14. CONCLUSION Referring to the qualities of discontinuity and divergence, E. C. Zeeman has said, Throughout the biological and social sciences these two qualities are frequently found, and are the origin of the label the 'inexact sciences' because it was thought that the existence of such qualities proved the impossibility of finding mathematical models that could be used for predictions. Now catastrophe theory shows that these two qualities are mathematically natural, and can be handled precisely. Moreover classifying the</page><page sequence="95">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 211 singularities synthesizes the information about the possible types of discontinuity and divergence. Therefore catastrophe theory promises to be a major advance in making the inexact sciences exact and scientific. (Zeeman, 1973a, p. 13). While this assessment seems to us over-optimistic about the future of ACT, it is certainly wrong about the capabilities and past achievements of the rest of applied mathematics. Whatever the contribution of CT within pure mathematics itself, for applications to the 'inexact sciences' there are plenty of existing mathematical tools capable of handling discontinuity and divergence more simply and effectively. The mathematics of quantum theory, bifurcation theory, and shock waves, for example, are well established, widely used methods involving discontinuity and divergence. Even simpleminded thresholds can describe these quantities, as we have shown: CT is unneces sary. As for neurophysiology, the Hodgkin?Huxley equations are far superior to the CT model. It may well be that the tradition of using only continuous models has hampered the applicability of mathematics to biology and the social sciences. Since CT is also continuous (smooth, in fact), it falls within this very tradition. Purely discrete methods (graph theory, automata theory, combina torial methods, etc.) are gaining widespread acceptance in the 'inexact sciences', however, and it would be unfortunate if the claims of ACT obscured this. It will be said that ACT is a new theory, and while none of the models is completely successful, each one has benefits of one kind or another that make it worthwhile. We are willing to be lenient. We are prepared to consider a model useful even if - it rests on questionable assumptions;or - it is based on faulty reasoning; or - it leads to wrong conclusions; or - it deals with ambiguous concepts; or - it does not make testable predictions. A model with several of these faults may still be valuable ? so long as it does not have all of them. In this paper we have examined a few CT models which are regarded as important and typical by E. C. Zeeman, one of the leading proponents of</page><page sequence="96">212 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER ACT.13 In these models (as well as many more by different authors which will be treated in a forthcoming paper) we find a combination of all of the above deficiencies. The assumptions made are usually well suited to force a catastrophe into the picture, but are not themselves plausible. Mathe matically, the arguments frequently depend on misusing Thorn's theorem and ignoring important questions about smoothness versus continuity versus discontinuity, so the reasoning cannot be called sound. While it may be possible to draw sensible inferences from some CT models, they lead to at least as many nonsensical conclusions. No CT model that we have seen is quantitatively correct, and the qualitative conclusions drawn are frequently wrong or vague or tautologous. Finally, the models do not really make testable predictions. It is thus hard to see what contribution CT has made to the biological and social sciences. Department of Mathematics Rutgers University NOTES * R. FitzHugh has contributed many illuminating comments in his letters to us, for which we are grateful. Jane Scanlon joined us in lengthy discussions that were of great help to us. We are indebted to H. Othmer, G. Carpenter, R. Bumby, and M. Golubitsky for their comments, and to David Berlinski for providing much of the stimulus to which this paper owes its existence. Finally, our warmest thanks go to the many mathe maticians who have expressed their support, as well as to those who have contributed comments critical of our work. 1 Precisely, the models considered here are taken from the list provided to us by Prof. E. C. Zeeman, in which he indicated which are, in his opinion, the most important applications of the theory. We are grateful to Prof. Zeeman for having helped us make a fair choice of what to criticize. 2 The model is not, however, representative of the proposed biological applications of Catastrophe Theory. When, in Parts III and IV, we discuss examples of such applications, it will become necessary to raise the level of mathematical sophistication. 3 For instance, here is a description, quoted by Bronowski (1973a), p. 233, of what took place when, in 1684, the astronomer Edmond Halley went to Cambridge to see Newton: "After they had been sometime together, the doctor [Halley] asked him what he thought the curve would be described by the planets, supposing the force of attraction towards the sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it. Sir Isaac replied immediately that it would be an ellipsis. The doctor, struck with joy and amazement,</page><page sequence="97">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 213 asked him how he knew it. 'Why', saith he, 'I have calculated it', Whereupon Dr. Halley asked him for his calculation without any further delay. Sir Isaac looked among his papers but could not find it, but he promised to renew it and then to send it to him". 4 More precisely, they are the points near which the implicit function theorem does not make it possible to solve for x. It may be possible to solve anyhow, as shown by the example of the equation (x - a)2 = 0, which defines x as a function of a in an obvious way, although every point in the solution set is singular. 5 Precisely, the critical set of the function / is the canonical model of the cusp surface. A surface S is a cusp surface if it is equivalent to the canonical model, i.e. if there is an admissible transformation that transforms it into the canonical model. The definition of 'admissible transformation' is given later. 6 Let X be a topological space that has the Baire property, i.e. every intersection of a countable family of open dense sets is dense. A property of elements of X is generic if the set of points of X that satisfy the property contains a set which is a countable intersection of open dense sets. Therefore, genericity is not a property that elements of X may or may not have. It is a property of properties. Sometimes, if there is one generic property G of elements of X that clearly deserves to be singled out, one talks about points of X being 'generic', instead of saying that they satisfy property G, which happens to be generic. In the case we are now considering, Isnard and Zeeman use 'genericity' in this sense. The space X is the space of all smooth functions of three variables, with the Whitney topology. The property G is formally defined as follows. Consider P as a map from the a, ? plane to the space (f?(R) of C?? real-valued functions of one real variable. Then P has G if and only if P is transversal to the natural stratification of C??(R). 7 The reader should notice the dates of the four examples just quoted. Two of them - the war model and the one on stock exchanges - appear in articles published in 1974, whereas the other two are taken from articles published in 1976. It is interesting to compare these examples with Zeeman's 1974 paper on 'Primary and Secondary Waves in Developmental Biology', which we discuss in Section 12.1. In that paper, Zeeman is confronted, in one step of the proof of his 'main theorem', with the same difficulty: he has information about the critical set of a family of functions, from which it follows that there must be at least one cusp. He then wants to conclude that there is exactly one cusp. However, the conclusion does not follow, for the same reason why it does not follow in the four examples that we have just discussed. So Zeeman brings in an ad-hoc hypothesis, especially tailored to get the desired conclusion. Precisely, he makes an ad-hoc reinterpretation of one of the vague words that appear in the statement of his theorem, namely, 'continuity'. He chooses to interpret it as "minimal discontinuity subject to differentiation" (after having chosen a different meaning earlier in the proof). He then asserts that, with this interpretation, 'continuity' implies that there is only one cusp, since a single cusp is the "simplest solution of the extension problem". It is significant that two of the four papers discussed here were written the same year as the 'Primary Waves ... ' article, and that the other two were written two years later. 8 x' need not exist, since it may happen that / decreases without every reaching a minimum, e.g. if fia, x) = x. If x exists, it need not be unique, but the only case when x may fail to be unique is when /has a local maximum at jc? . (Cf. Figure 13.) 9 A letter by one of the authors to E. C. Zeeman inquiring about "experiments that might test Catastrophe Theory" elicited the reply that "There are none! Like</page><page sequence="98">214 HECTOR J. SUSSMANN AND RAPHAEL S. ZAHLER Differential Equations Theory, Catastrophe Theory is a mathematical theory, not a scientific one [sic], that nevertheless gains interest from its applications. Of course there are many applications, both good and bad, and some of those can be tested - but the best people to ask about experiments are the practitioners in the specific fields, who have proposed models and are working with them, rather than to ask mathematicians". (Letter from E. C. Zeeman to H. J. Sussmann, dated October 22, 1976.) This was followed by a letter from H. J. Sussmann, in which a specific question was asked about "experiments testing the nerve impulse model". Zeeman's reply, dated February 2, 1977, states that "no experimentalist has written to me saying he has tested the nerve-impulse model, nor have I heard of anyone doing experiments to test it yet". 1 ? A defender of the Isnard-Zeeman model might reply as follows: 'It is absurd to assert that there is nothing between peace and all-out war. A government can put its forces on alert, it can issue threatening statements, it can use covert action, it can apply economic pressure, it can support the political opposition of the rival nation'. This reply in no way invalidates our argument. Indeed: (a) our reasoning does not deny the existence of a large number of possibilities other than war and peace. The assumption that these alternatives can be parameterized by a one-dimensional continuum - the level of military action - is made by Isnard and Zeeman, not by us. Our criticism of Isnard-Zeeman only makes that same assumption for the purpose of this argument. Otherwise, if the assumption is rejected, then the case against the Isnard-Zeeman model is even stronger. (?Given the assumption of a one-dimensional continuum of alternatives, one can either imagine this as a continuum of values of one clearly observable variable (say, the number of soldiers send to attack the enemy nation), or as a continuum of values of a not-so-well-defined variable which represents 'strength of action* in such a way that each policy corresponds to a value of the variable. If the latter interpretation is adopted, then it may seem reasonable to interpret the Isnard-Zeeman model as including all the possibilities, such as covert action or economic pressure, in this continuum. As usual, the discussion by Isnard and Zeeman is not clear enough for us to be able to figure out which interpretation they have in mind. However, our criticism applies no matter which one is adopted. Indeed, this is clear if we adopt the first interpretation. Suppose now that we adopt the second one. Consider, for instance, the policy CA (for 'covert action') which consists of sending ten secret agents to assassinate the president of the enemy nation. For each x, let sx be the policy that consists of invading the enemy nation with an army of x soldiers. Under the assumption of a one-dimensional continuum of 'strengths of military action', it is clear that there is a value x?A ?f x sucn that the policy 5*cA *s equivalent to CA, in the sense that both correspond to the same level of military action. (Reason: sx corresponds to very weak action if x is very small, and to very strong action if x is very large. Hence, by continuity, there is an x such that sx corresponds to the same strength as the 'intermediate' action CA.) In this way, it seems that one can regard each possible policy p as 'equivalent' to a policy of the form sx, where x will depend on p. Now, the fact still remains that what is usually meant by 'the outburst of a war' is a sudden transition from a policy sx with x = 0 to a policy sy with v very large. Also, the fact remains that the policies sx that correspond to 'intermediate' values of x (e.g. the Japanese sending just one plane to attack Pearl Harbor) are not feasible, although for each one there may be another feasible policy that is 'equally strong' (e.g. attacking Pearl Harbor with just one plane</page><page sequence="99">CATASTROPHE THEORY: A CRITIQUE 215 may have been 'equally strong' as sending an agent to assassinate the mayor of a small town in Nevada). And the fact that these policies are not feasible suffices to explain why Ihere are 'attack catastrophes' (i.e. upwards jumps in the value of x). The existence of the other policies is therefore completely irrelevant. 1 * More than two thousand years ago, Zeno formulated his celebrated paradox of the arrow. Consider an arrow in its flight. "At each instant of its flight the tip of the arrow occupies a definite position. At that instant the arrow cannot move, for an instant has no duration. Hence, at each instant the arrow is at rest. Since this is true at each instant, the moving arrow is always at rest. This paradox is almost startling. It appears to defy logic itself." (Kline, 1964a, p. 404) The development of Calculus has resolved this paradox, and taught us how it is possible for things to change and, at the same time, be what they are at each instant. The position of the tip of the arrow is what it is at each time, but it is different at different times. Hence the arrow can have a definite position at each time, and not be at rest. What is true of the position is also true of velocity. The velocity has a value at each point, but this does not mean that it is constant. Zeeman, a Twentieth Century Zeno, is reformulating the paradox as a Corollary, thus ignoring more than two millenia of mathematics. 12 Professor R. Abraham informed one of us (H. Sussmann), on January 21,1977, that the source of his statement was Professor Zeeman, in a conversation he had with Prof. Abraham. To our knowledge, no effort has been made by Prof. Zeeman in the five years that have elapsed since the publication of Prof. Abraham's notes, to correct the statment we have quoted. That the statement was false, and remains false as of February, 1977, can be seen from Note 9. 13 Cf. Note 1.
