      <p>As Laurie Maguire points out in this engaging, learned, and far-reaching
inquiry into names and naming, the act of assigning names to living
creatures is one of the first of God's commissions bestowed on Adam
in the Garden of Eden. Maguire quickly goes on to cite “She
Unnames Them” (1985), a short story by Ursula K. Le Guin in
which the unnamed wife of Adam undoes all this naming frenzy; the
animals gladly accept namelessness because generic names of the sort
Adam presumably uses are not linked to individual identity. The act
of naming can too easily become masculine, generalizing, anthropomorphic,
and phallocentric, especially when it comes to generic names of species.
Personal names and nicknames are more comfortable; they fit the individual,
whereas generic labels are useful to others. They belong to the nominator,
not the nominee. “All is convention and habit of the users,”
says Hermogenes in Plato's <italic>Cratylus</italic>.1 Le Guin's Eve gladly gives her own name back to
Adam and to Adam's “father” by way of attempting to abolish
difference, hierarchy, the divisiveness of linguistic labeling, and
the role imposed on her as the mother of the human race.</p>
      <p>Maguire's book is thus not simply about the importance of names
in Shakespeare's plays; it is also, as she says, “a book about
the ways in which language (of which names are a subdivision) relates
to material objects.” Names matter, and they themselves “are
matter—material entities capable of assuming lives and voices
of their own” (4). Her topic has important implications for
the studies of philosophy and history, but her main focus is on language
and on formal close analysis of six plays in particular: <italic>Romeo
and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer
Night's Dream, All's Well That Ends Well</italic>, and <italic>Troilus
and Cressida</italic>. She illustrates from modern journalism, film,
cartoons, and fiction (though without pictured illustrations, other
than Evelyn De Morgan's <italic>Helen of Troy</italic> [1898] on the
dust jacket).</p>
      <p>Maguire begins her task with a historical survey of the problematic
relationship between names and what they are used to signify, from
the Bible and Greek literature on down to contemporary literary theory
and social anthropology. Names are the means by which we are given
status in society; to be nameless is to suffer erasure of social identity
and uniqueness. Ill-chosen names can bring bad luck. Tragedy uses
real names, comedy fictional ones (as Aristotle observes).</p>
      <p>A chapter on patronymics focuses on <italic>Romeo and Juliet</italic> and on the ways in which the labels “Montague” and “Capulet”
become hardened into battle cries of senseless differences between
the two families; the names have codified into linguistic forms of
knowing one's family identity and hence whom one is supposed to hate.
Romeo and Juliet are nameless to each other when they meet, but all
too soon “What's in a name?” takes on ominous meaning.
The wish to deny what is spoken proves impossible. Oxymoron is the
play's dominant linguistic mode. Linguistic disagreement has lent
itself well to a 1989 Canadian production of <italic>Romeo and Juliet,</italic> with six anglophone cast members ranged against six francophones,
showing how the discourse of the lovers is virtually bilingual. Chapter
3 is all about “Helen” and its variant forms of “Helena”
and “Nell,” a name so potent in Trojan history that it
has a determining effect on those so named in <italic>A Midsummer
Night's Dream, Troilus and Cressida, All's Well,</italic> and the <italic>Henry IV/V</italic> plays to the extent that the dramatist is driven
to seeking means of redressing a historical injustice. An old false
etymology saw in “Helen” the Greek root <italic>hele</italic>, or “destroyer,” despite the efforts of Euripides and
others to defend her reputation. Theseus took part in the rape of
Helen, according to Plutarch, thereby introducing the theme of sexual
violence into the stories of both Hippolyta and Helena in <italic>A Midsummer Night's Dream</italic>. Helena in <italic>All's Well
That Ends Well</italic>  is repeatedly associated with Helen
of Troy's binary reputation for whorishness and maligned virtue. Helena
is also associated with Cressida, whose seduction extensively parallels
that of Helen of Troy.</p>
      <p>Chapter 4 turns to “Kate” as a prominent instance in
Shakespeare of a diminutive, asking what such a form of the name has
to say about the character. The point is illustrated in an open-air
metatheatrical production of <italic>The Taming of the Shrew</italic> by the Oxford Stage Company in the summer of 2006. Maguire's analysis
is deeply informed by Maurice Natanson's study of the anonymity that
results from a person's being seen in terms of her or his social role.2 Anonymity can reside in multiple
names. By addressing Katherine (as she is known to herself and others)
as “Kate,” Petruchio in effect renames the woman he plans
to control, because once she takes his name in marriage her name and
reputation will be subsumed into his good name.</p>
      <p>Chapter 5 is about the place-name “Ephesus” (Shakespeare's
substitute for the “Epidamnum” or “Epidamnus”
of his source in Plautus) as it bears on questions of gender in <italic>The Comedy of Errors</italic>. The history of “Ephesus,”
it turns out, incorporates two disparate traditions, one depicting
the independent pagan Amazonian woman (cf. Adriana), and the other,
conversely, the submissively Christian Pauline wife (Luciana). Marriage
is at once a transaction in which men trade women as their possessions
and a sacred union combining two in one. Twentieth-century productions
tend to bear out Maguire's thesis that the play is about thematic
as well as cast doubling and that the play might just as well be called “the
girls from Syracuse.”</p>
      <p>The book is beautifully written, with verve and urbane wit and
not a smidgen of critical jargon, providing instructive and lively
instances from every imaginable corner of the author's widely varied
reading experience. Maguire wears her learning lightly. She quotes
David Lodge, Margaret Atwood, Helen Cooper, Derek Walcott, and Seamus
Heaney along with Frances Dolan, Anne Barton, Jocelyn Catty, Juliet
Dusinberre, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. The book is an essay in
the great tradition of Montaigne, Bacon, Madame de Staël, George
Orwell, and E. B. White. It abounds in  anecdotal illustrations about
punning etymologies like <italic>domini canes</italic> (hounds of
God) for the Dominicans, punning book titles like Erasmus's <italic>Moriae encomium</italic> (Praise of folly<italic>)</italic> with
reference to Thomas More; humorous reflections of the meaning of names
(what was Saint Christopher, meaning “carrying Christ,”
called before he carried Christ across a river?); sexual double entendres
(Dame Pliant in Jonson's <italic>The Alchemist</italic>); foreign
language puns (Harry Le Roi in <italic>Henry V</italic> );
disguise names (Aliena for Celia in <italic>As You Like It</italic>); comically appropriate names (Les Plack, a dentist); and much more.
Maguire cherishes anthologies of naming, such as William Camden's <italic>Remains</italic> and Richard Verstegan's <italic>A Restitution of
Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities</italic>, both printed in 1605.
She offers a well-documented argument that Shakespeare could have
read Euripides. <italic>Shakespeare's Names</italic> is, to borrow
a phrase from <italic>Love's Labour's Lost</italic>, “a great
feast of languages,” both in its graceful writing and its endearing
subject.3</p>
