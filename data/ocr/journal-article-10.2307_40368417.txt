MALCOLM TURVEY I In The World Viewed, Stanley Cavell argues that "film is a moving image of skepti- cism."1 Due to what he calls its "automatism," its removal of "the human agent from the task of reproduction,"2 film, he claims, satisfies the wish, borne of skepticism and "intensifying in the West since the Reformation, to escape subjectivity and metaphysi- cal isolation - a wish for the power to reach this world, having for so long tried, at last hopelessly, to manifest fidelity to another."3 By skepticism, it should be noted, Cavell does not mean a rigorously theorized philosophical doctrine, but rather the some- what vaguer idea, hugely influential in modernity and still very much with us, that the ability of us human beings to know the world around us is limited, that we are unable, or fail, to know reality as it really is. The deep hold of this skeptical idea over film theorists and filmmakers has not, I think, been given its due. The same is true of that which skepticism gives rise to: the wish to escape the limits of human knowledge and access reality as it really is. Much film theory and filmmaking informed by film theory, especially prior to the 1960s, is a euphoric expression of the belief that in the cinema we finally have at our disposal an artistic medium that satisfies the skeptical wish identified by Cavell, that overcomes the gulf created by skepticism between subject and object, self and other, conscious- ness and nature - our "metaphysical isolation," to use Cavell's felicitous phrase. For most, however, it is not only what Cavell calls film's automatism that enables it to "escape subjectivity" and "reach this world." In the context of film, skepticism has typically taken the form of claims about the limits of human vision, about our inability to see reality as it really is, which is unsurprising given that the cinema is widely consid- ered to be a visual art. And it is the cinema's capacity to reveal truths about reality invisible to human sight that is viewed by many as the source of its power to escape the 1.

The major film theorists who conceive of the cinema in this way are Jean Epstein (1897-1953), Dziga Vertov (1896-1954), Siegfried Kracauer (1889-1966), and Bela Balázs (1884-1949) in the material from Der sichtbare Mensch (The Visible Man, 1924), his first book of film theory, which he includes in Theory of the Film (1948), his third, and which he elaborates on in other chapters of Theory of the Film, such as chapter eight, titled "The Face of Man." Like Epstein, Vertov, and Kracauer (in Theory of Film, 1960), Balázs answers the question What is Cinema? in this material by arguing that one of the cinema's most significant properties is its capacity to reveal features of reality invisible to the naked human eye: "In the silent film facial expression, isolated from its surroundings [by the close-up] , seemed to penetrate to a strange new dimension of the soul. It revealed to us a new world - a world of micro-physiognomy which could not otherwise be seen with the naked eye or in everyday life."4 And again like these theorists, Balázs often compares the cinema to other visual technologies, in particular the microscope: The technique of the close-up . . . was able to make us feel nerve-rackingly the sultry tension underneath the superficial calm; the fierce storms raging under the surface were made tangible by mere microscopic movements, by the displacement of a hair. Such films were unsurpassed in showing the Strindbergian moods in the savagely antagonistic silences of human beings confined together in narrow spaces. The micro-tragedies in the peace and quiet of ordinary families were shown as deadly battles, just as the microscope shows the fierce struggles of micro-organisms in a drop of water. (TTF, pp. 84-85) Like these theorists, Balázs also attaches considerable significance and value to the cinema's revelatory capacity. Indeed, he claims that this capacity has brought about the evolution of new perceptual and cognitive abilities in human beings: "The birth of film art led not only to the creation of new works of art but to the emer- gence of new human faculties with which to perceive and understand this new art" (TTF, p. 33). And he declares that it is the task of his film theory to "investigate and outline that sphere of the development of human sensibility which developed in mutual interaction with the evolution of the art of the film" (TTF, p. 33). Because it has lead to the evolution of new perceptual and cognitive abilities, Balázs pro- nounces the invention of the cinema to be an epochal transformation for the better in human existence: The evolution of the human capacity for understanding, which was brought about by the art of the film, opened a new chapter in the history of human culture We were witnesses not only to the development of a new art but to the development of a new sensibility, a new understanding, a new culture in its public We have learned to see.

For Epstein and Vertov, the eye is flawed and unreliable because of innate, physiological handicaps, which cannot be over- come (except perhaps by evolution). For Epstein, the eye shrouds reality in deceptive, anthropomorphic appearances: These [cinematic] experiments contradict and throw into confusion the sense of order which we have established at great cost in our conception of the universe. Yet it is hardly news that any classification has something of the arbitrary about it and that we abandon frameworks that seem overly artificial. The generalized sense of our own psychological time, which still varies very little, turns out to be an illusion that we have created in order to think more easily. The gaze which cinematography lets us cast over nature, where such time is neither unique nor constant, is perhaps more fecund than the one we cast out of egocentric habit Not without some anxiety, man finds himself before that chaos which he has covered up, denied, for- gotten, or thought was tamed. Cinema apprises him of a monster.5 In 1921, for example, Epstein evokes the scientific doctrine of "secondary qualities" to make this point: The senses, of course, present us only with symbols of reality: uniform, proportionate, elective metaphors. And symbols not of matter, which therefore does not exist, but of energy; that is, of something which in itself seems not to be, except in its effects as they affect us. We say "red," "soprano," "sweet," "cypress," when there are only velocities, movements, vibrations.6 By contrast, the cinema is able to reveal what is hidden by such secondary qualities, namely, reality as it really is: the "waves invisible to us, and the screen's creative pas- sion [which] contains what no other has ever had before; its proper share of ultraviolet."7 For Vertov, meanwhile, the eye is very bad at processing visual data into organized, intelligible patterns. Hence, human beings are normally confused by what they see. Vertov gives as an example stage performances. "The viewer at a ballet fol- lows, in confusion, now the combined legs of dancers, now random individual figures, now someone's legs - a series of scattered perceptions, different for each viewer."8 The cinema, according to Vertov, is able to overcome this limitation, 5.

A day of visual impressions has passed. How is one to construct the impressions of the day into an effective whole, a visual study? If one films everything the eye has seen, the result, of course, will be a jumble. If one skillfully edits what's been photographed, the result will be clearer. If one scraps bothersome waste, it will be better still. One obtains an organized memo of the ordinary eye's impressions.10 But for Balázs, at least in part, human beings cannot see properly because they have forgotten how to, due to historically specific forces at work in modernity. According to Balázs, the invention of the printing press made language and the printed word the dominant media through which human beings express their inner, mental lives in modernity, giving rise to what Balázs calls a "word culture": "The print- ing press has grown to be the main bridge over which the more remote interhuman spiritual exchanges take place and the soul has been concentrated and crystallized chiefly in the word" (7TF, p. 41). The result, for Balázs, is that within modernity, human beings have almost totally lost the capacity to express the inner with their faces and bodies: "The animals that do not chew lose their teeth. In the epoch of word cul- ture we made little use of the expressive powers of our body and have therefore partly lost that power" (TTF, p. 42). The loss of this ability means that the dimension of the inner that used to be expressed by the face and body can no longer be expressed: We had, however, when we neglected the body as a means of expression, lost more than mere corporal power of expression. That which was to have been expressed was also narrowed down by this neglect. For it is not the same spirit, not the same soul that is expressed once in words and once in gestures. ( TTF, p. 42) While language is capable of expressing the inner, it cannot express the same dimen- sion of the inner as facial expression and bodily behavior. Language and the body each express different realms of the inner. Those who do not speak may be brimming over with emotions which can be expressed only in forms and pictures, in gesture and play of fea- ture. The man of visual culture uses these not as substitutes for words, as a deaf-mute uses his fingers. He does not think in words, the syllables of which he sketches in the air like the dots and dashes of the Morse code. 9. Vertov, "Kino-Eve" (1926), in ibid., p. 73. 10.

Such emotions lie in the deepest levels of the soul and cannot be approached by words that are mere reflections of con- cepts; just as our musical experiences cannot be expressed in rationalized concepts. What appears on the face and in facial expression is a spiritual experience which is rendered immediately visible without the intermedi- ary of words. (TTF, p. 40) With the loss of the face and body's ability to express the inner comes a concomitant spiritual impoverishment in modernity. That realm of the inner that can only be expressed by the face and body - the realm of "non-rational emotions" - remains unexpressed, leaving just the "rational, conceptual culture" of the word (TTF, p. 43). The loss of the capacity to use the face and body to express the inner in turn has an impact on normal human vision, and it is in describing this impact that the influence on Balázs of skepticism emerges. Human beings have forgotten how to see the face and body as expressive of the inner in the "word culture" of modernity, according to Balázs. They have lost this visual capacity or skill, because the face and body are no longer used to express the inner. Meanwhile, because the cinema lacks synchronized sound in the silent era, actors are forced to re-learn how to express the inner through facial expression and bodily behavior. This is why Balázs in his early film theory believes that the cinema is bringing about the evolution of new percep- tual and cognitive abilities in human beings. Now the film is about to inaugurate a new direction in our culture. Many million people sit in the picture houses every evening and purely through vision, experience happenings, characters, emotions, moods, even thoughts, without the need for many words. Humanity is already learning the rich and colorful language of gesture, movement, and facial expression. This is not a language of signs as a substitute for words, like the sign language of the deaf and dumb - it is the visual means of communication, without intermediary of souls clothed in flesh. Man has again become visible. (TTF, p. 41) Due to the cinema's lack of synchronized sound, actors are forced to express the inner through the face and body. From them, human beings are once again re- learning how to "read" the "language" of the face and body: Now we are beginning to remember and relearn this tongue. It is still clumsy and primitive and very far removed as yet from the refinements of word art. But already it is beginning to be able sometimes to express things that escape the artists of the word. How much of human thought would remain unexpressed if we had no music! The now developing art of facial expression and gesture will bring just as many submerged</page><page sequence="6">82 OCTOBER contents to the surface. Although these human experiences are not rational, conceptual contents, they are nevertheless neither vague nor blurred, but as clear and unequivocal as is music. Thus the inner man, too, will become visible. ( TTF, p. 42) According to Balázs, therefore, normal human vision suffers from a historical limitation specific to the "word culture" of modernity. Because this limitation is only historical, as opposed to physiological, the eye can potentially recover from it, and this is precisely what Balázs believed was starting to happen in the silent era. The cin- ema, he thought, was re-educating human beings how to use and understand the language of facial expression and bodily behavior. What Balázs calls the "submerged," "unexpressed" realm of the inner was becoming visible again for the first time since the invention of the printing press. With the arrival of synchronized sound, however, all of this changed. Actors reverted to spoken language to express the inner, and the new education being offered by cinema in the silent era was cut short. Balázs's skepticism about normal human vision is an idiosyncratic version of what can be called the "modern consciousness" theory, which has its roots in Romanticism. This argues that various forces in modernity - principally science, technology, and the putative penetration of "instrumental reason" into all spheres of human existence - have had a profound effect on human beings. These forces have actually altered the way that the average person's mind works, giving rise to a distinctively modern form of consciousness that is overly "rationalistic" and intrinsi- cally divorced from the senses, the body, and nature in general. Rudolf Arnheim nicely summarizes key elements of this view at the beginning of Art and Visual Perception (1954): We have neglected the gift of comprehending things through our senses. Concept is divorced from precept, and thought moves among abstrac- tions. Our eyes have been reduced to instruments with which to identify and to measure; hence we suffer a paucity of ideas that can be expressed in images and an incapacity to discover meaning in what we see. Naturally we feel lost in the presence of objects that make sense only to undiluted vision, and we seek refuge in the more familiar medium of words.11 We can unweave several strands in this familiar generalization about modern con- sciousness. First is the argument that it is divided into two realms, the mental and the physical, and that they are divorced from each other ("concept is divorced from pre- cept"). Second is the suggestion that the overly rationalistic mental realm dominates the physical senses, particularly the eyes ("our eyes have been reduced to instruments with which to identify and measure"). As a result, human beings no longer attend to what the senses have to teach them independently of the mental realm ("we have neglected the gift of comprehending things through our senses"). Finally, there is the 11. Rudolf Arnheim, Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), newversion, expanded and rev. ed., p. 1.</page><page sequence="7">Balázs: Realist or Modernist f 83 claim that people now typically "seek refuge" in the more familiar mental realm of "abstractions," "concept [s]," and the "medium of words," rather than the physical realm of the senses, because rationalistic consciousness no longer knows how to learn from "undiluted vision," namely, vision functioning independently of the mental. Clearly, this theory evinces a deep skepticism about the normal exercise of the visual faculty, seeing it as part of a modern consciousness enslaved to rational, instru- mental imperatives. Human beings have lost the capacity of gaining purely visual knowledge of reality in modernity ("the gift of comprehending things through our senses"; "undiluted vision"). Balázs modifies this theory by placing an intermediary stage - the use of language in place of the face and body to express the inner - in between the tendency to "seek refuge in the more familiar medium of words" and the failure to attend to what the senses have to teach independently of language. It is the use of language in place of the face and body, due to the dominance of language in the "word culture" of modernity, which results in human beings forgetting how to see the face and body of another as expressive of mind, according to Balázs. As we shall see in a moment, this did not mean, however, that for Balázs the realm of the inner expressed by the face and body once again became "submerged" and "unexpressed" when synchronized sound arrived, as it had been prior to the invention of cinema. According to Balázs, normal human vision also suffers from a second limitation, namely, its failure to see details: By means of the close-up the camera in the days of the silent film revealed also the hidden mainsprings of a life that we had thought we already knew so well. Blurred outlines are mostly the result of our insensitive short-sightedness and superficiality. We skim over the teeming substance of life. The camera has uncovered that cell life of the vital issues in which all great events are ultimately conceived; for the greatest landslide is only the aggregate of the movements of single particles. A multitude of close- ups can show us the very instant in which the general is transformed into the particular. The close-up has not only widened our vision of life, it has also deepened it. In the days of the silent film it not only revealed new things, but showed us the meaning of the old. (TTF, p. 55) Human beings, Balázs argues again and again, are very bad at noticing details. They tend to "skim over the teeming substance of life." They look at reality as a concert-goer ignorant of music listens to an orchestra playing a sym- phony. All he hears is the leading melody, all the rest is blurred into a gen- eral murmur. Only those who can really understand and enjoy the music can hear the contrapuntal architecture of each part in the score. This is how we see life: only its leading melody meets the eye. ( TTF, p. 55) It is not clear from these passages whether Balázs believes that the inability to notice details is an innate physiological limitation of normal human vision or a visual habit that can be corrected. But either way, it is a limitation that the cinema overcomes,</page><page sequence="8">84 OCTOBER primarily through the close-up: "But a good film with its close-ups reveals the most hidden parts in our polyphonous life, and teaches us to see the intricate visual details of life as one reads an orchestra score" (TTF, p. 55). Because it isolates and magnifies, the close-up reveals details that are invisible to sight: "An ant-heap is life- less if seen from a distance, but at close quarters it is teeming with busy life. The gray, dull texture of everyday life shows in its microdramatics many profoundly moving happenings, if we look at it carefully enough in close-up" ( TTF, p. 86). Because the naked eye cannot see details, it is unable to see the inner expressed in the details of the faces and bodies of others. But the close-up isolates, magnifies, and therefore renders visible the inner manifested in the details of a face or body; "But in the isolated close-up of the film we can see to the bottom of a soul by means of such tiny movements of facial muscles which even the most observant part- ner would never perceive" (TTF, p. 63). Thus, the realm of the inner expressed by the face and body did not once again become "submerged" and "unexpressed" when synchronized sound arrived. Although this happened to some extent, the use of the close-up in sound film ensured that this realm of the inner remained partially visible, even though actors were no longer forced to use their faces and bodies to express themselves because of synchronized dialogue. This is because the close-up, by isolat- ing and magnifying the details of the faces and bodies it films, can reveal the inner expressed in those details - details that the naked eye cannot see unaided. To summarize, though human beings cannot see details or the face and body as expressive of the inner due to the "word culture" of modernity, the cinema escapes these limits because, in the silent era, actors are forced to learn how to express them- selves through their faces and bodies, thereby educating the film viewer to see the face and body as expressive of mind; and because the close-up isolates and magnifies details invisible to normal vision. It is for this reason that Balázs believes that the cin- ema can initiate an epochal transformation for the better in human existence. Its revelatory capacity rescues human beings from the particular type of blindness that, due to skepticism, he believes the naked eye to be suffering from: an inability to see other minds. II I have argued that Balázs, like Epstein, Vertov, and the later Kracauer, answers the question What is Cinema? by arguing that one of the cinema's most significant properties is its capacity to reveal truths about reality invisible to the naked human eye. This answer is different from the two answers to this question that have domi- nated film theorizing since it began. The first of these is that the cinema's most significant property, at least for the purpose of creating art, is "its capacity to manipu- late reality, that is, to rearrange and thereby reconstitute the profilmic event (the event that transpires in front of the camera)."12 This answer is identified as modernist 12. Noel Carroll, Philosophical Problems of Classical Film Theory (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 7.</page><page sequence="9">Balázs: Realist or Modernist ? 85 because it is predicated on conceptions of art prevalent in modernism - anti- imitation, medium-specificity - and it was the most popular answer among film theorists until the 1930s, the period when the influence of modernism was at its height. Furthermore, like modernism, it reemerged with renewed vigor in the 1950s. A famous example of this modernist answer is provided by Arnheim in his Film as Art, first published in 1932. According to Arnheim, if a filmmaker wishes to create a work of art, he cannot simply reproduce what is in front of the camera. Rather, he must express something about what is in front of the camera using uniquely cinematic techniques. This is because Arnheim has an anti-imitation and a medium-specificity conception of art, both prevalent in modernism: The film producer himself is influenced by the strong resemblance of his photographic material to reality. As distinguished from the tools of the sculptor and the painter, which by themselves produce nothing resem- bling nature, the camera starts to turn and a likeness of the real world results mechanically. There is serious danger that the filmmaker will rest content with such shapeless reproduction. In order that the film artist may create a work of art it is important that he consciously stress the pecu- liarities of his medium. This, however, should be done in such a manner that the character of the objects represented should not thereby be destroyed but rather strengthened, concentrated, and interpreted.13 Although they would not necessarily agree with Arnheim 's expression conception of art - his claim that "the character of ... objects represented should not ... be destroyed but rather strengthened, concentrated, and interpreted" - many other modernist film theorists argue that the cinema's most significant property is its capacity to manipulate reality. They include German psychologist Hugo Münsterberg; Soviet montage filmmakers of the 1920s, such as Lev Kuleshov and Sergei Eisenstein; and most of the French Impressionist filmmakers of the 1920s, such as Germaine Dulac. The second of the historically dominant answers to the question What is Cinema? is that the cinema's most significant property is its capacity to reproduce, rather than manipulate, reality. The most famous representative of this answer is probably André Bazin, who grew to maturity during the 1930s when realism renewed its influence on western artists and intellectuals. Bazin offers a number of arguments in his writings for why this is so. One focuses on the fact that photographs mechani- cally record reality. When exposed, the chemicals on the surface of a film automatically register the light emanating from whatever the camera is pointing toward. According to Bazin, a photograph therefore "shares, by virtue of the very process of its becoming, the being of the model of which it is the reproduction; it is the model."14 This means that, for the first time in history, photographs allow human 13.

Hugh Gray (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), p. 14.</page><page sequence="10">86 OCTOBER beings to "re-present" reality. Cinema goes one step further than still photography in re-presenting reality because "for the first time, the image of things is likewise the image of their duration, change mummified as it were."15 Because Bazin believes that human beings have "a basic psychological need ... to have the last word in the argu- ment with death by means of the form that endures,"16 and because photography and cinema offer an unprecedented way of satisfying this need by re-presenting real- ity, he concludes that the cinema's most significant property, especially with the advent of synchronized sound, is its capacity to reproduce reality, not manipulate it. While I do not dispute that these two answers - the modernist and the realist - to the question What is Cinema? are historically dominant in film theory even to this day, there are others, including the one advanced by Epstein, Vertov, Balázs, and Kracauer - namely, that the cinema's most significant feature is its capacity to reveal truths about reality invisible to the naked human eye. This answer constitutes a dis- tinct alternative to the historically dominant ones of modernism and realism. For on the one hand, like the realist answer, it views the cinema's ability to reproduce reality as a valuable one, rather than denigrating it, as do modernists such as Arnheim. Epstein, Vertov, Balázs, and Kracauer constantly laud the cinema's capacity to repro- duce reality as it really is. However, as we have seen in the case of Balázs, these film theorists are influ- enced by a skepticism that takes the form of doubts about normal human vision. It is this that sets them apart from realists such as Bazin, who believe in the capacity of the human eye to see reality as it really is, who have faith in normal human vision. Linda Nochlin cites the writings of the painter Edgar Degas as an example of this faith in everyday sight in nineteenth-century realism: In his notebooks, Degas reiterated in both words and sketches his passion for concrete, direct observation and notation of ordinary, everyday expe- rience: "Do every kind of worn object . . . corsets which have just been taken off . . . series on instruments and instrumentalists . . . for example, puffing out and hollowing of the cheeks of bassoons, oboes, etc. . . . On the bakery, the bread: series on journeyman bakers, seen in the cellar itself or through the air vents from the street. ... No one has ever done monuments or houses from below, from beneath, up close, as one sees them going by in the streets."17 In Bazin 's writings, we often encounter a similar faith in normal human vision, and the view that certain films are realist art works because they imitate features of every- day sight. In an article on William Wyler, for example, Bazin argues that "'Realism' consists not only of showing us a corpse, but also of showing it to us under conditions that re-create certain physiological or mental givens of natural perception."18 And he 15.

Bert Cardullo,</page><page sequence="11">Balázs: Realist or Modernist f 87 celebrates directors such as Jean Renoir and Wyler because they use stylistic tech- niques such as the long take that, supposedly, better imitate the "givens of natural perception" than editing. For Epstein, Vertov, Balázs, and Kracauer, the human eye is not to be trusted. It is not a reliable source of information about reality. Hence, contrary to Bazin, these theorists view those stylistic techniques that depart from everyday sight as most likely to reveal reality as it really is, techniques that modernists such as Arnheim typically celebrate due to their anti-imitation, medium-specific conceptions of art: slow motion, fast motion, reverse motion, extreme close-ups or long shots, editing, and so on. As Vertov puts it, Until now many a cameraman has been criticized for having filmed a run- ning horse moving with unnatural slowness on the screen (rapid cranking of the camera) - or for the opposite, a tractor plowing a field too swiftly (slow cranking of the camera), and the like. These are chance occurrences, of course, but we are preparing a system, a deliberate system of such occurrences, a system of seeming irreg- ularities to investigate and organize phenomena. Until now, we have violated the movie camera and forced it to copy the work of the eye. And the better the copy, the better the shooting was thought to be. Starting today we are liberating the camera and making it work in the opposite direction - away from copying.19 However, unlike modernists such as Arnheim, Epstein, Vertov, Balázs, and Kracauer do not view these techniques as incompatible with recording and reproducing reality. Rather, they celebrate these techniques, including the cinema's capacity to record reality, because they better enable filmmakers to reproduce reality as it really is, not because they enable filmmakers to avoid "merely" reproducing reality, as they do for Arnheim and other modernists. Because this answer - call it the revelationist answer - to the question What is Cinema? shares features with both the modernist and realist answers, there has been some debate about how to categorize the work of these film theorists. Dudley Andrew's The Major Film Theories (1976), for example, has been criticized by Sabine Hake for placing Balázs along with Arnheim in the "formative" or modernist tradi- tion, and Kracauer in the realist.20 However, if I am correct, Balázs and our other theorists belong neither in the one nor the other. Rather, they propose an answer to the question What is Cinema? that is distinct from the realist and modernist answers, even while it has features in common with them.21 trans.
