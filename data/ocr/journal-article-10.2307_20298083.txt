<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonas Salk The Survival of the Wisest A complete inversion of values is necessary if man is to move from the Darwinian era to the "epoch of cooperation"; the alternative is species suicide. X?1 unprecedented explosion of in terest and movements concerned with the survival of the species is now taking place. The idea of extermination, by man, of various forms of life on the planet, and the danger to human life, induces a fear that preoccupies increas ing numbers of individuals, especially of the generations now maturing. Those who are ecologically oriented and those who are profoundly concerned with the quality of life for the species as well as for the individual appear to stand in Opposition to others less aware of such problems. The fundamental difference between these two attitudes is that the first expresses concern for the individual and the species; the second reveals principally, and perhaps exclusively, an interest in the individual and the par ticular group of which he is a part. A major threat to the species is attributed to the increasing size of the human population, which, in turn, is ascribed to successes in science and technology. This "explanation" has evoked an attack upon science and the exploitation of its technology, to the development of which are attributed many adverse effects upon the human species and upon other forms of life. "Polluters" who befoul the planet affect the "quality of life," and are regarded as a threat to the present and future equilibrium of the species and of the planet. Those who consider themselves on the side of nature, and therefore of the human species, see others in opposi tion to both nature and man. Hence we are concerned not only with man's relationship to nature but with man's relationship to himself. If human life is to express as much harmony, constructiveness, and creativi ty as are possible for fulfilling the purpose o/life, as "required" by nature, and the purposes in life, as "chosen" by man, an attitude will be needed, not of man "against" nature, but man "in clusive with" nature. A more reasonable attitude would be for man to "serve nature" in order to serve himself, rather than to "serve himself without regard for, or at the expense of, nature and others. By recognizing and respecting the natural "hierarchies of purpose," man would be better able to gauge his JONAS SALK is founding director and resident fellow, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, Calif From the book The Survival of the Wisest, Copyright ?1973 by Jonas Salk.

The fork in the road at which man now stands offers either a path toward the development of ways and means for maximizing self-expression and self restraint, by means of external restraints that are not suppressive or oppressive, or an alternative path of limitless license which could unleash destructive and pathological greed at the expense of constructive and creative individuals. The challenge is to establish an equilib rium between self-expression with self restraint on the one hand, and self protection with self-restriction on the other. If man is to take advantage of the opportunities to remedy difficulties that have arisen as a result of his evolution, then he needs to understand his rela tionship to the evolutionary process which plays with and upon him. At this point in time, hypothetical models of probable patterns and mechanisms in volved would have to be tested for validity and would be helpful for guid ance. As we sharpen our ability to discern the pattern of order that must exist in the seeming chaos that we wish to comprehend, as we distinguish the elements that compose the conflicts and paradoxes of our lives, we encounter striking differences between age groups in the questions, preoccupations, and values espoused, especially in the so called advanced countries. This is most marked in the United States, but is by no means restricted to it; there is ample evidence of the same phenomena in other areas of the world where similar circumstances and conditions have de veloped. In our search for models, let us look at the curve describing the growth of human population on the face of the earth and the present reasonable projec tion over the next few decades to the year 2000 (Figure 1). This curve tells the story simply, although within it are expressed vast and complex implications for the character and quality of human life which concern relationships as well as resources for the present and the future. The trajectory not yet traced raises questions as to the means that man or nature will invoke to deal with the excesses that have developed and the insufficiencies that persist. Will man create his own procedures to deal with them, or will nature's simple ways come into play, some of which may prove quite undesirable from man's point of view? This, in fact, may already be occurring. Before turning our attention to the questions and consequences of the rapidly mounting curve of population increase as drawn in Figure 1, or of the implications of its curtailment or of its continuation, let us look at patterns of growth in other living systems. For example, Figure 2 shows the growth curve of a fruit fly population as ob served by Raymond Pearl in 1925. The S-shaped or sigmoid curve which described the growth of fruit flies is also seen in curves of growth of micro organisms and of cells or molecules. Similar curves are seen for hormone production after suitable stimulus, and a similar effect occurs in tissue repair after injury. Significantly, this is not true in cancerous conditions, where the cancerous cells have escaped the normal ly present control and regulatory factors which have developed in the course of evolution in surviving organisms. Since the planet earth can be considered a closed system, and since the sigmoid curve reflects the operation of control and regulatory mechanisms which ap pear to be associated with survival of the individual or of the species, it would seem reasonable to expect that the 668 PHI DELTA KAPPAN</page><page sequence="3">8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 April May Figure 2.

It is possible, of course, that an alternative pattern might resemble that of the lemmings, in which periodic catastrophe occurs with enormous loss of life. How ever, man's attitude toward human life would have to alter significantly for such patterns to be endured; he is more likely to choose other ways than catas trophe for maintaining optimal numbers on the face of the earth while remaining within the limit of available resources. As man has still to complete a cycle of growth on this planet, he has not yet fully revealed the pattern biologically programmed in him, or the way it will be influenced by factors he is responsi ble for, or by natural forces beyond his control. Therefore we are unable to know the pattern of his trajectory in the short- or long-term future. The "catas trophists" and harbingers of doom are in themselves evidence that man pos sesses a signaling mechanism for sound ing warnings of danger. If we assume that man has the power of choice and can influence the course of his growth curve on this planet, then it is of special interest to look carefully at the sigmoid curve in terms meaning ful for him. It is interesting to explore the possible meaning of the similarities observed in the human population growth curve as manifested thus far, and the first portion of the growth curve of the fruit fly population and similar curves in the subsystems of other living systems. If we allow our imaginations free rein to reflect on the implications for man of the curve depicted in Figure 2, and if we think in anthropomorphic terms, as suming the flies arc sentient beings possessing foresight and insight, then it is apparent that the "outlook" of each new generation must differ from that of others, depending on the circumstances prevailing at the point in time along the curve when that generation came on the scene. As we study the curve in Figure 2, consideration of the lower portion only gives the impression of continuous, even explosive, expansion, whereas con sideration of the upper portion gives the impression of modulation and control of this expansion, so that finally a limit is established. At the junction of the lower and upper portions of the curve is a region of inflection at which there is a change from progressive acceleration to progressive deceleration and at which the influence of the controlling process is clearly visible. The break apparent in this region suggests that a "signaling" mechanism of some kind must operate to bring about this change, producing an effect which, judging from the shape of the curve, indicates the existence of a uniform process, reflecting the opera tion of some kind of ordering principle in response to "signals" both from the environment and from within the or ganisms themselves. At different points in time along the curve, latent qualities and reactions are evoked which are appropriate to survival, the program for which is coded in the germ plasm, which also contains an accumulation of regu latory factors essential thereto. At the plateau stage of numbers, the individuals in the fly population would be expected to "behave" differently, as compared to those alive earlier in the growth curve, i.e., before the zone of inflection when different "problems" prevailed. Man differs from other living or ganisms in possessing another "control and regulatory" system for response to environmental and other changes, in addition to that genetically coded and automatically operative as in the fruit fly, which has been tested and selected in the course of evolutionary history. Man is able to exercise learned behavior. He also possesses individual will, which can be either in accord qr in conflict with genetically coded patterns of re sponse. In this sense, man is more complex and more unpredictable than the fruit fly. He can also learn to behave in ways that are anti-life as well as pro-life, anti-evolution as well as pro evolution. He remains to be tested for this pattern of response to all that is implied in the need for changing values to make the transition from Epoch A (first half of the sigmoid curve) to Epoch B. Because man's greed and ideologies have caused many of his conflicts, attitudes as well as values will be put to test in the transition from Epoch A to Epoch B. Thus man is being subjected to a new and possibly more severe challenge than ever before, for which he needs perspec tive and insight. He must become aware of the opportunities and the dangers that he will have to face when con fronted by the conflicts resulting from a necessary inversion of such magnitude as implied by the diagram in Figure 2. The profundity of the change in values required for survival and for the quality of life in the periods I have la beled Epochs A and B makes it seem not only that what was of positive value in A may, in fact, become of negative value in B; but, also, if "B values" had prevailed earlier, they would have been of opposite value in the A epoch. From this point of view, it is not difficult to understand the depth and meaning of the change which man is now ex periencing in the various forms that have already become manifest under the specific historical circumstances in dif ferent cultures in all parts of the world.
