<plain_text><page sequence="1">"I Aint Heard One in Years": Wolves as Metaphor in The Crossing Wallis R. Sanborn, III In The Crossing , the hinge of the Border Trilogy and Cormac McCarthy's seventh novel, the wolf is an honorable warrior animal, and its absence from the New Mexico of the novel signals man's presence there and becomes a negative metaphor for man's ceaseless appetite for control over the natural world. Man controls or kills that which exists freely in the natural world, and in The Crossing, the wolfs absence is the direct result of man's acts and desires, for the wolf is a livestock predator and as such, must be eradicated. In order to better understand Cormac McCarthy's use of the wolf in The Crossing , historical context of European man's views on the wolf must be addressed. Fear and loathing of the wolf have long been custom in Europe, and as Barry Lopez, the author of the comprehensive text Of Wolves and Men, notes, the Lascaux caves in Dordogne, France, feature pictographs of prey animals drawn circa 13,000 BC and highlight the an- cient rivalry between wolf and man (88, 96). Further, the prehistoric com- petition between man and wolf for game and territory was the dominant predatory rivalry of its day, and that competition for prey created a natural oppositional dyad between man and beast (Lopez 88). Because of this rivalry, the wolf was both vilified by peoples of European descent well into twentieth century and mythologized by many indigenous peoples in the western hemisphere. For the Europeans, the wolf was an enemy in the fight of survival, but the wolf played an important role in the religious ceremony of many non-Christian and pre-Christian peoples, and "native human hunters ascribed to wolves many positive qualities such as intelli- gence, boldness, and skill" (Klinghammer 80). The importance of the wolf in the life of pre-modern, pre- Christian man can best be evidenced by the legend of the founding of Rome, which, according to Roman mythology, would have been impossi- ble without the aid of a benevolent she-wolf. Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of the god Mars and the Vestal Virgin, Rea Silvia, were cast into the Tiber River in a basket by Amulius, Rea Silvia's father; after the bas- ket floated to shore, the infants "were suckled by a she-wolf' (Tripp 514- 15), an animal sacred to their father. Eventually, Romulus, determined to found a new city, did so, naming it after himself (Tripp 514-16). The pre- Roman she-wolf is not the rival of man, but is the savior of Rome and is a sacred animal worthy of veneration. In an image that McCarthy exploits in The Crossing , the she-wolf is maternalized as well, becoming a surro- gate mother to the infants. Clearly, the she- wolf of classical Roman my- thology is, in a manner of speaking, the mother of Rome, and she is nei- ther feared nor loathed. However, in Greek mythology, the pejorative legend of the were- 25</page><page sequence="2">wolf was created (Klinghammer 79), and the werewolf legend threaded through history and became intertwined with Christianity. With the advent of Christianity and the dawning of the Dark Ages, the wolf once again became a villain. The wolf was vilified in medieval Europe primarily be- cause the Roman church, the dominant cultural and religious force of the day, "exploited the sinister image of the wolves" (Lopez 208) in order to control the people through fear, and subsequently, thousands of people were tried and then executed as werewolves. The Church's use of the ly- canthropic image was so effective because "in medieval Europe... the wolf had become a widespread symbol of evil" (Klinghammer 79), and to equate a person - man, woman or child - with a wolf was to equate that person with evil incarnate. Through both propaganda and prosecution, the ruthless Church hegemony contributed to the common perception of the wolf and wolf-likeness as evil. The result was a sort of mass hysteria, which lasted well into the second millennia. The second great medieval European influence contributing to the wolfs vilification was the advent of early modern agricultural and ranching practices. In early modern Europe, with the domestication of sheep and cattle, farmers viewed the wolf as a threat to their existence and sustenance. As Erich Klinghammer notes, wolves and agriculturists have long been at odds: Early European pastoralists and farmers probably knew very little about the ways of the wolves with which they shared a common habitat, other that that wolves killed their livestock. The wolf thus became hated as a raider and an enemy, and to this day ranchers chiefly see what (to them) is the bad side of the wolf - its predatory nature. (80) Clearly, the medieval farmer rightly feared the wolfs ability to prey upon stock, but his image of the wolf was "embellished, exaggerated, distorted, or twisted to fit an image based not on careful observation but on imagination, myth, and anthropomorphic projections of human charac- teristics onto the wolf' (Klinghammer 78). Interestingly, the wolf remains vilified through the second millen- nia and into the third. And regardless of where European settlers landed in the Western Hemisphere, they perpetuated their phobia and hatred of the wolf. As Klinghammer notes, people's hatreds and prejudices migrate with them: "European immigrants to North America brought along their negative attitudes toward the wolf, and this resulted in efforts to destroy wolves wherever they were found" (88). After the early 1600s, when Wil- liam Penn "established possibly the first governmental wolf bounty" (Robisch 289) in the new world, the wolf had bounty- value and thus was worth more dead than it is alive. Klinghammer also points out that west- ward migration meant "the wolf and one of its prey species, the American bison, had to give way" (88). Consequently, wolves "did take their share of livestock, especially when human activities displaced or destroyed their natural prey" (Klinghammer 81). And as the wolves' prey diminished during the last half of the nineteenth century due to man's hunting and land clearing and not the wolves' natural pr√©dation, the wolves sought sustenance by attacking easy fodder - the domestic animals owned by westerly moving settlers. As the wolves attacked more and more live- 26</page><page sequence="3">stock, their increasing bounty- value occasioned a bounty system created to eradicate them and to appease and compensate the livestock owners who were settling the American West and Southwest (Klinghammer 81). The bounty system in New Mexico continued through the turn of the twentieth century and into the late nineteen twenties, when it was led by J. Stokely Ligon, "who oversaw the New Mexico district of the Bureau of Biological Survey [and] made heroes of the trappers on the payroll" (Robisch 289). The result of the centuries-old battle against the wolf in the United States is obvious: the wolf has very nearly been eradicated from North America. But as the twentieth century closed, the federal government has again gone to work, this time in an attempt to save the wolf: Two pairs of endangered Mexican gray wolves were placed in holding pens Thursday on the Gila Wilderness as a preamble to their even- tual release into the wild. Ranchers, including one not far from the release site, accepted the news philosophically, but said they were opposed to it. . .[and] are surprised that the Bush administration permits the program to continue. ("Endangered" B 1 5) Even at the dawn of the twenty-first century, old animosities persist, and as the Associated Press has reported, "the livestock industry continues to try to sabotage the [wolf release] program" ("Endangered" B15). Even one wolf near livestock is one too many, as is evident in The Crossing , and to some extent, in all three texts of the Border Trilogy. Throughout Part I of The Crossing, McCarthy promotes wolves collectively and the she-wolf individually, elevating the beast above popu- lar mythology while concurrently acknowledging its doom as an indige- nous species of the southwestern United States. In McCarthy's Naturalist world, man - as a separate and unequal member of nature - controls the animals he can, and he kills those animals he cannot. The rancher's desire to rid southern New Mexico of the wolf (which, unlike the carrion- scavenging coyote, is the bane of the commercial livestock industry) made the wolf bounty lucrative, so the wolf had already been nearly extermi- nated from the southwestern United States prior to the chronology of The Crossing. Indeed, the wolfs absence from southern New Mexico is why the she-wolfs presence in Hidalgo County is so exciting to Billy Parham. By the opening of the text proper, which James Bell identifies as 1941 (40), the wolf has been banished from the area of action, but in a brief scene of pre-chronology, set in 1931, a six-year-old Billy watches the last of the New Mexico-based Mexican gray wolves run antelope in the winter moonlight (C 3-5). The ethereal scene of these master predators is one Billy will never see again, for the wolf is gone from New Mexico by his sixteenth year. In the midst of the wolf-eradication frenzy, Billy commits a shortsighted, but seemingly noble and honorable act: he attempts to re- turn the captured she-wolf to Sonora, Mexico. But after the she-wolf is trapped, she suffers a series of indignities. In addition to being captured by an adolescent, the she-wolf, pregnant and forever separated from her deceased life-mate, is dragged by Billy's horse, muzzled, attacked by ranch dogs, tied up, force-fed cold rabbit (a humiliation to the master predator), nearly drowned while bound, stolen from Billy, poked and spit upon by Mexican rabble, forced to fight for show until death, and finally, 27</page><page sequence="4">finally, shot by Billy out of mercy. Of course, had he not initially caught and taken control over the wild animal - an utterly human act in McCarthy's world - the she-wolf perhaps would have returned to Mexico on her own and survived and birthed her litter, thus perpetuating her spe- cies. But the she-wolf is most likely doomed from the instant a rancher discovers her first local kill, a "veal calf' (15) - a valued commodity. While Billy's misguided attempts at honor do allow the doomed she-wolf some dignity prior to her demise as she battles the dogs, the she-wolf is nonetheless just as dead as she would have been if some rancher had shot her while she was caught in a trap. The calculus remains the same: man controls, often through killing, that which exists freely in the natural world. In The Crossing, the absence of the wolf from southern New Mex- ico is the direct result of the acts and desires of man, for the wolf is a live- stock and game animal predator and as such, must be controlled, that is, hunted to the point of extinction. In "The Trapper Mystic: Werewolves in The Crossing ," S. K. Robisch argues that in The Crossing , the trapper (the wer-wulf / the man- wolf) is in a cosmic dyad with the wolf, in which both are mystified and mythologized and subject to reciprocal extinction: "McCarthy has given us opportunities to romanticize and mystify the wolf, but he has also loaded his narrative with the blood and darkness that ensue when we seize those opportunities - that is, when we trap the wolf' (290). Robisch points out that the material absence of the legendary trapper Echols implies that "the success of the trapper results in his own extinction as well as his prey's" (290). The trapper and the wolf are in a blood covenant, the result of which is loss of trapper and loss of wolf, and perhaps the ancient rituals of blood between man and wolf are part of the collective unconscious of each, and of both. Don Arnulfo warns Billy that trapping a wolf sets the wolf towards incorporeality, for one can neither possess nor know a wolf (C 46). Billy sets the traps as instructed by Don Arnulfo, and he traps not only the she-wolf but himself as well (Robisch 291). For Robisch, the final mystification of the trapper, of the wolf and "of the hunt is found in McCarthy's indication that the she-wolf is caught in Billy's trap the day his parents are killed" (292). Death begets death, and "there is no me- chanical trap without its astral counterpart" (292). Robisch effectively shows the mystification and mythologizing of the wolf in The Crossing , but McCarthy mythologizes the wolf in other texts as well. In Cormac McCarthy's four novels of the Border Southwest, the presence of wolves in the text decreases as the dating of the action of the texts moves foreword approximately one hundred years. In the Border Southwest of 1848-49, wolves actively inhabit the region and the text and are quite often present with McCarthy's historical gang of scalphunters. In fact, wolves are granted warrior status, akin to the scalphunters they shadow through the mountains and deserts of Chihuahua and Sonora states, Mexico. Blood Meridian has McCarthy first defining the mythic qualities of the wolf, while the text also lends a ghost-like quality to the animal - as if the animals are haunting the men: "They [the kid and Sproule] set forth with first light while wolves. . .dissolved in the fog of the streets" (61). The wolves, who trail the men in shadowy fashion, disap- 28</page><page sequence="5">pear when the killing is in temporary reprieve; the wolves reappear when killing occurs to dine on gore "pudding" (60), but McCarthy uses a verb with mythic, mystical and magical connotation - dissolve - to label the animals' exit from the streets. These wolves do not lope into the bushes; they become incorporeal. In using such a verb, McCarthy's narrator im- plies that wolves are not bound by material limits, and wolves can thus appear, disappear, and reappear at will. Later in the text, the wolfs super- natural powers are further alluded to when the kid and Sproule are afoot and come upon a band of Mexican bandits, whose leader says to the Anglo pair, "When the lambs is lost in the mountain... They is cry. Sometime come the mother. Sometime the wolf' (65). This explicit warning utilizes the legend of the wolfs predatory prowess to suggest that the pair is lucky the Mexicans are in a benevolent frame of mind. But read more closely, the passage suggests the wolf is such a tremendous predator that the ani- mal's auditory sense is so acute that it is finer than the hearing of the lamb's mother, that the wolfs predatory senses are in effect more power- ful than the bond between mother and child. Consequently, the wolf can halt the life cycle prematurely. This interpretation also hints at the wolf as the bane of commer- cial or sustenance livestock owners of the early and middle twentieth cen- tury. Finally in Blood Meridian , Tobin the expriest, the second most learned scalphunter, claims that the power of the wolf exceeds the under- standing of even an enlightened man: "we come upon a band of wolves. They scattered and come back, not a sound out of them no more than smoke. . .Bold as brass. . .1 would never shoot a wolf and I know other men of the same sentiments" (129). In this passage, McCarthy again alludes to the wolves' power to mesmerize and mystify; the wolves are as silent and weightless as floating smoke. McCarthy implies that the wolves are ethe- real, not physical. These wolves are also animals of courage, and the wolves do no cower in fear of the scalphunters, but close in around the human predators. Moreover, Tobin implicitly argues that it is a karmic mistake to kill a wolf, and for effect, Tobin includes the assertion that other men feel about wolves as he does. Even the judge, master predator among the predatory, seems somewhat in awe of wolves: "Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could?" (146). Tobin, the judge and the others - men who live and kill and die on a daily basis - fear and admire wolves for their legendary and factual powers. Perhaps these superstitious fears are part of what contributed to the demise of the wolf in the Border Southwest. By the opening of All the Pretty Horses , wolves are all but extinct in Texas, the border regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. McCarthy has stepped for- ward a century, and in late March of 1950 (Bell 3), John Grady Cole, Lacey Rawlins and Jimmy Blevins exit Texas, U.S.A., and enter Mexico. In doing so, the trio enters a world unknown to them, and part of this un- known world is the fauna of Mexico, specifically, the wolf. On a night spent on the run from a posse from the pueblo of Encantada, the trio settles for the evening and hears a sound heretofore unheard by their twentieth century Texans' ears: 29</page><page sequence="6">. . . At just dark they benched out on a gravel shelf and made their camp and that night they heard what they'd none heard before, three long howls to the southwest and all afterwards a silence. You hear that? said Rawlins. Yeah. It's a wolf, aint it? Yeah. ...He [Cole] lay a long time listening to the others breathing in their sleep while he contemplated the wildness about him. ... (59-60) In this brief dialogue Rawlins seeks from Cole a second in his opinion that the howls are those of a wolf, and it is readily apparent that neither has heard the call of a wolf before, for McCarthy presents Texas in 1950 as a place where the wolf is extinct. The presence of the wolf sym- bolizes that the three boys are no longer in the "civilized" confines of the forty-eight United States and that they are now in a wild, savage country. The howling wolf, now no longer merely a legend to them, has the power to capture their minds and conversation. Interestingly, in this scene the wolf is heard, but is not seen. In presenting the animal as a sound in the dark, McCarthy further elevates the mystical and supernatural value of the wolf. The power of the wolfs howl resonates in Cole's mind; up until this moment in his life, Cole, growing up in a land where wolves have been displaced by cattle and cattle ranches, knows only the legend of wolves. In Cities of the Plain , McCarthy uses the character of the aged rancher, Mr. Johnson, as a conduit to the era between Blood Meridian and the Border Trilogy, and through him, explains the disappearance of the wolf from the Border Southwest while further reinforcing the mystical qualities of the master canine. Mr. Johnson, McCarthy's vehicle to the vanished past, tells of man's ignoble treatment of the noble, but problem- atic, predator: . . .Maybe it's just that when things are gone they're gone. . . . ...The day after my fiftieth birthday in March of nine- teen and seventeen I rode into the old headquarters at the Wilde well and there was six dead wolves hangin on the fence. I rode along the fence and ran my hand along em. I looked at their eyes. A government trapper had brought em in the night before. They'd been killed with poison baits. Strychnine. Whatever. Up in the Sacramentos. A week later he brought in four more. I aint heard a wolf in this country since. I suppose that's a good thing. They can be hell on stock. But I guess I was always what you might call superstitious. I know I damn sure wasnt religious. And it had always seemed to me that something can live and die but that the kind of thing that they were was always there. I didnt know you could poison that. I aint heard a wolf howl in thirty odd years. I dont know where you'd go to hear one. There may not be any such a place. (126) 30</page><page sequence="7">Mr. Johnson shows that the wolves' time in that country has passed, due to man's ability to poison and eradicate the predators. Wolves kill stock, so the wolves must be banished from the country. And as usual in McCarthy's universe, through blood or poison, the stronger, better, more effective predator defeats the able, but less-skilled predator. And as Mr. Johnson indicates, not only is the wolf gone from the area, but also the aura of the wolf has been poisoned and has disappeared. Clearly, Mr. Johnson's lament is meant to bridge the chronological gap between the close of Blood Meridian , in 1878, and the opening of All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing, in 1949 and 1941, respectively. Note also that the pas- sage alludes to the federal government's wolf eradication program and hints at the bounty-value of the dead wolf; to man, to the rancher, to the hunter, to the federal government, the wolf is an animal worth more dead than alive. In this brief but telling passage, the sad history of the eradica- tion of the wolf from the southwestern United States is redacted. The wolf was not allowed to survive. Hence, McCarthy throws a wolf into a wolf- less world, and hence Billy Parham begins his ill-fated quest. In her influential essay, "The Vanishing World of Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy," Dianne C. Luce examines the ecological implications of the trilogy with its exploration of "the predatory nature of man and his drive for civilization" (122) and argues that Billy Parham becomes externally and internally hardened by death and brutality, "because he has learned not to feel so deeply his pain at the extermination of the Mexican wolf in the Southwest, the incursion of technology and government into the terrain of his youth, the vanishing of the cowboy and his way of life-or to acknowledge it consciously" (121). Luce maintains "the ecological vision of the Border Trilogy" (121) is most "explicit" in Part I of The Crossing and situates upon "the ecological and spiritual con- cerns of Billy Parham, whose totem is the wolf (the predator who must remain wild if she is to exist at all)" (122). Luce points out that "the core image of the vanishing world in the trilogy is the vanishing loba-thQ Mexican gray wolf," who "comes to represent not only the material world of nature destroyed by man, but the very spirit of wildness and of the ex- ternal world itself, a swift huntress that the world cannot lose... an indis- pensable manifestation of the world itself' (125,130). But Billy and the world do lose the Mexican gray wolf, and as Luce adroitly shows, this loss is central to Part I of The Crossing and, indeed, is a motif in all three texts of the Border Trilogy. McCarthy uses this irremediable loss as a metaphor for man's ceaseless quest to control the natural world, even to the point of self- destruction that Robisch's analysis of the symbiosis between trapper and wolf suggests. The absence of the wolf from the southwestern United States - with emphasis here on Hidalgo County, New Mexico, in the win- ter and spring of 1941 - indicates the encroachment of Western man upon the wolfs historical territories to meet his own agricultural needs. How- ever, in a scene set a decade before the primary action of the text, McCarthy shows that the eradication of the wolf from the area is a fairly 31</page><page sequence="8">recent thing, while he also mythologizes the ancient hunters: On a winter's night that first year [Billy Parham] woke to hear wolves in the low hills to the west of the house and he knew that they would be coming out onto the plain in the new snow to run the antelope in the moonlight. . . .(3) This moonlight hunt is a window into the past, not only Billy's childhood past, but the pre-human past. McCarthy is allowing the reader, as well as Billy, to see that which occurred prior to the encroachment of man upon the territories of the wolf. This ancient ritual, taking place in 1931, is McCarthy's statement of the wolfs mythic timelessness; wolves will be eradicated over time, but the wolfs essence - its social and preda- tory skills - will exist so long as one wolf exists in the wild. The scene takes place during the Parham family's first winter in Hidalgo County. The family is representative of many, many families encroaching upon the wolfs territory at the time. Additionally, the family's home is located on the fringe of the wilderness. Aided by proximity, Billy is allowed to field study the wolf pack on the hunt to the west of the house. This direction indicates the Wild West, that is, the uncivilized and untamed west, the west of the wolf now threatened by the proximity of agricultural man. In this passage early in the novel, McCarthy turns the hunt into an ethereal ballet, and the wolves and their prey leap and dance, seemingly at play. But as "they" enter onto the plain, that is, as the wolves and antelope collectively race onto the plain, the killing will occur, outside the textual action. Because McCarthy presents the scene from Billy's point of view, the narrator does not follow the hunt to its climax. Instead, McCarthy waits with Billy until the wolves, sans antelope, return moving south and west: He was very cold. . .and he waited a long time. Then he saw them coming. Loping and twisting. Dancing. Tunneling their noses in the snow. Loping and running and rising by twos in a standing dance and running on again. There were seven of them and they passed within twenty feet of where he lay. He could see their almond eyes in the moonlight. He could hear their breath. He could feel the presence of their knowing that was electric in the air. They bunched and nuzzled and licked one another. Then they stopped. They stood with their ears cocked. Some with one forefoot raised to their chest. They were looking at him. He did not breathe. They did not breathe. They stood. Then they turned and quietly trotted on. . . .He never told anybody. (4-5) As six-year-old Billy waits for the return of the hunters, he no- tices the cold, but as the wolves approach, he is transfixed as the animals socialize in collective joy. Notice that in this scene, McCarthy does not perpetuate any negative mythology of the wolf, but he shows an ancient action that is eventually extinguished by civilized man. What makes this hunt even more unique is that it is a pack-on-herd hunt, not a hunt between individual animals. This group-on-group hunt emphasizes the destructive 32</page><page sequence="9">power of man upon the natural world, for by 1941, the year the text proper begins, no wolf packs or antelope herds exist in Hidalgo County. Another facet reinforcing the hunt's mystical quality is the fact that Billy never tells anyone about what he saw and experienced on this night, and as read- ers of the third text in the Border Trilogy are aware, Billy lives quite a long life. Interestingly, Billy learns of the presence of the she-wolf in Hi- dalgo County at the dinner table, when the Parham family is dining on beefsteak: You all set down, their mother said. She set a platter of fried steaks on the table. A bowl of beans. When they'd said grace she handed the platter to their father and he forked one of the steaks onto his plate and passed it on to Billy. Pap says there's a wolf on the range, she said. Billy sat holding the platter, his knife aloft. A wolf? Boyd said. His father nodded. She pulled down a pretty good sized veal calf up at the head of Foster Draw. When? said Billy. Been a week or more. ...She come up out of Mexico. (15) This humorously ironic scene identifies the absolutely important role of the beef in the lives of the Parham family; beef is sustenance and life. Twice in this brief passage, McCarthy identifies the bovine with hu- man consumption. The family dines on fried beefsteak, while the family discusses the presence and damage caused by a lone wolf. Of course, the wolf has killed a calf, and not merely a calf, but a veal calf - a calf specifi- cally bred for commercial production and human consumption. So, obvi- ous to reader and character alike, the wolf must be eradicated by whatever means necessary, for one marauding wolf in Hidalgo County is one wolf too many. And the hunt is on, but when Billy traps the she-wolf, he is faced with a dilemma, one in which even honorable acts go horribly awry. While McCarthy honors and promotes the mythos of the wolf in The Crossing, he also demonstrates man's urge to control the natural world in a series of human-driven indignities the she-wolf is forced to un- dergo prior to her death. Ironically, all of these indignities occur only be- cause Billy attempts to help the she-wolf. As is true with many of McCarthy's other works, the noble act is punished. Although noble, Billy's mission to return the captured she-wolf to Mexico is abjectly flawed. It is based on human control over the natural world; Billy first captures and controls the she-wolf through trickery and force (52). He then binds and muzzles the animal and drags her back to Mexico (74). Thus Billy's mission is nothing more than a man violently controlling a wild animal through the guise of pseudo-nobility, just another of many McCarthy examples of man overwhelming the fauna and flora of the natu- ral world. In The Crossing, not only do Anglos seek dominion over the 33</page><page sequence="10">natural world, but Mexicans do as well, and McCarthy shows that the thirst to control the natural world is not limited by race or nationality. In a telling scene, a scene that incorporates the Mexican citizen into the slaugh- ter of the wolf, McCarthy's narrator describes the situation for the she- wolf on the Mexican side of the border: ...She carried a scabbedover wound on her hip where her mate had bitten her two weeks before somewhere in the mountains of Sonora. He'd bitten her because she would not leave him. Standing with one forefoot in the jaws of a steeltrap and snarling at her to drive her off where she lay just beyond the reach of the chain. She'd flattened her ears and whined and she would not leave. In the morning they came on horses. She watched from a slope a hundred yards away as he stood up to meet them. She wandered the eastern slopes of the Sierra de la Madera for a week. Her ancestors had hunted camels and primi- tive toy horses on these grounds. She found little to eat. Most of the game was slaughtered out of the country. Most of the forest cut to feed the boilers of the stampmills at the mines. (24-25) Here, the she-wolf is witness to man's controlling hand, and the she-wolf is also astute enough to move from the area as man approaches. Of course, the wolf hunters are to kill the trapped male wolf. In doing so, they kill the progenitor of the she-wolfs unborn litter (25) and the social and biological mate of the she-wolf. In essence, killing the alpha member of this pack of two is killing the entire genetic line, for the fetal pups die after the she-wolf is killed and buried (129). Consequently, the pair and all of their offspring and potential offspring are eradicated in the single snapping shut of a trap. The passage above indicates that northern Mexico is devoid of wolves, too, and that man's encroachment upon the natural world - in this case the industry is mining - in either Mexico or the United States leads to devastation of the wolf. Notable, too, is the fact that hunt- ing, ranching, farming, mining and lumbering are all commercial ventures where man seeks to control or dominate the natural world. All these hu- man activities devastate the wolfs natural habitat. Like the southwestern United States, Sonora, Mexico, is devoid of prey for the wolf, for man in Mexico has also killed off the wolfs natural prey. The result for a wolf is the same in both Mexico and New Mexico. On both sides of the border, man is attempting to eradicate the wolf, so the Mexicans' delight in seeing the wolf do blood-battle with the hounds is somewhat understandable. But, of course, the she-wolf would not have ended up in the gladiatorial arena if Billy had not trapped, muzzled, and bound her in the first place. Billy's trapping the she-wolf ultimately destroys her. Billy is representative of man; his actions, man's encroachment upon the natural world. He captures the she-wolf because she is encroaching upon ranch- ing man's world, a world where cattle are both highly valued commercial property and a primary source of sustenance. Billy therefore knows that 34</page><page sequence="11">his father or another rancher will kill the she-wolf without hesitation. Moreover, his capture of the she-wolf is analogous to all the previous cap- tures and killings of wolves that were committed by man: "She was caught by the right forefoot [like her mate]. The drag had caught in a cholla less than a hundred feet from the fire and there she stood. He patted the horse and spoke to it and reached down and unfastened the buckle on the saddlescabbard and slid the rifle free and stepped down and dropped the reins. The wolf crouched slightly"(52). In a scene foreshadowing the she-wolfs death, Billy pulls his rifle from its scabbard and considers shooting the she-wolf, as his father had advised, but he does not. "In no way prepared for what he beheld" (53), Billy remounts his horse and be- gins to ride away. However, he decides to return to the she-wolf, and in a mildly brutal scene, he successfully muzzles and lassoes and secures the she-wolf. "It aint no use to fight it" (56), Billy says to the wolf. It is also no use for the wolf to fight the encroachment of man, for man overwhelms the natural world. And once the she-wolf (or any wolf for that matter) is captured, the wolf is doomed. Billy's binding and muzzling of the she- wolf is a very human act in McCarthy's world, and a rare one in middle twentieth century New Mexico, for a passing old man - a character similar to Mr. Johnson - is McCarthy's bridge between the present and the past: I guess you'll collect the bounty. Sell the hide. Yessir. . . .When we used to bring cattle up from the valley from down around Ci√©nega Springs. ... And you could hear em all across the valley. Them first warm nights. You'd nearly always hear em in that part of the valley. I aint heard one in years. (60) The old gentleman, a former cowboy, notes that the wolves heard once are to be heard no longer, because the lupine predator became a bounty animal and subsequently was hunted to regional extinction. Ad- ditionally, this passage indicates a change in the natural world that was brought on by man's willful actions. And when Billy decides to take the she-wolf to Mexico, his decision only hastens the inevitable death of the animal. Billy decides to take the she-wolf into Mexico (63), but his deci- sion is not necessarily the decision that kills the she-wolf, for the she-wolf as negative metaphor for man's encroachment upon, and destruction of, the natural world, must die. The day following the capture, the ill-fated pair enters Sonora. But in Mexico, as has previously been noted, the wolf is also a bounty animal and a rare sight as well. Subsequently, Billy is arrested and the she-wolf is confiscated, and Billy's dream of returning the she-wolf to the Pilares Teras comes to its necessary end, and the she-wolf is to fight to the death paired teams of two dozen hunting dogs. The she- wolf battles nobly, and to save the she-wolf from being torn apart, liter- ally, Billy first argues for the wolfs life and then shoots the she-wolf: "He said that the tracks of the wolf had led out of Mexico. He said the wolf knew nothing of boundaries. The young don nodded as if in agree- ment but what he said was that whatever the wolf knew or did not know 35</page><page sequence="12">was irrelevant and that if the wolf had crossed that boundary it was per- haps so much the worse for the wolf but the boundary stood without re- gard" (119). Although boundaries and borders are manmade, man rules either side of any boundary. According to the Hacendado' s son, Billy and the she-wolf are encamped on the wrong side of the boundary, but in fact, she will die on either side. For the wolf, there is no right side. In an act of submission and an attempt to save her from further humiliation and suffer- ing, Billy finishes her off: "He... levered a shell into the chamber of the rifle and halted ten feet from her and raised the rifle to his shoulder and took aim at the bloodied head and fired" (122). Billy returns the she-wolf to the earth, but McCarthy does not entirely remove the wolf from the text. Interestingly, the text is devoid of flesh-and-blood wolves after Part I, but Billy does manifestly dream of wolves two times (295-96, 325-26). Billy's first dream is especially sig- nificant: He'd trudged in his dream through a deep snow along a ridge toward a darkened house and the wolves had followed him as far as the fence. They ran their lean mouths against each other's flanks and they flowed about his knees and furrowed the snow with their noses and tossed their heads and in the cold their pooled breath made a cauldron about him and the snow lay so blue in the moonlight and those eyes were palest topaz where they crouched and whined and tucked their tails and they fawned and shuddered as they drew close to the house and their teeth shone that were so white and their red tongues lolled. At the gate they would go no further. They looked back toward the dark shapes of the mountains. ...and then they turned and wheeled away and loped off through the snow and vanished smoking into the winter night. (295) The dreamscape is similar in tone and atmosphere to the opening hunting passage of the text, but here, the wolves follow Billy. However, he is followed only up to the point where he enters the world of civilized man, the fence. Of course, in the old west, the gated fence was symbolic of man corralling or capturing a measured and surveyed section of the natural world. In this dream, the wolves refuse to enter the world of civi- lized man, even though the wolves do follow Billy part way. For to enter the gated area is to enter a world of imminent death and destruction, be- cause the gated fence is also representative of man as cattle rancher, and cattle ranchers are the bane of the wolf. The wolves let Billy enter the gated area, while they also look and then run toward the mountains, a pos- sible avenue to freedom from man. Of course, as the reader is well aware, the mountains, be they in Mexico or New Mexico, cannot hide the wolf from man, and in this dream scene, the narrator, the reader, and perhaps even Billy, can read the explicit symbolism of the wolves' refusal to enter the gated area of the homestead. The wolf and the man cannot coexist. Before the wolves, is the gate, the fence, man's homestead, the present and future. Behind the wolves are the mountains and the past. The dream 36</page><page sequence="13">wolves attempt to return to the past, and their aura-their authenticity, their wolfness- exists only in Billy's memory and psyche once he awakens. In The Crossing, the absence of the wolf from the southwestern United States, with emphasis on southern New Mexico and northern Mex- ico, signals the presence of man, not just any man, but European man; history shows that European man has a cultural bias against the wolf, and when this bias is conjoined with New World capitalism, he views the eradication of the wolf as apt and fit. More specifically, the absence of the wolf indicates the presence of the cattle rancher, for in both the United States and in Mexico, the existence of the wolf is contrary to successful cattle production. Wolves do not know borders and so cross them when- ever survival dictates, but the wolf is doomed in either country, on either side of the border. And McCarthy shows that both the Americans and the Mexicans seek the demise of the wolf, specifically here the she-wolf Billy traps and captures. Man's intolerance for the wolf leaves little room for man's honor, and both man and the wolves suffer because of the dishonor involved in the eradication efforts; man suffers because man is dishonor- able, and the wolf suffers because she is annihilated. McCarthy uses a lone wolf, the pregnant she-wolf, to present his argument that man kills that which he cannot control. The wolf cannot be controlled; therefore, the wolf is eradicated. In The Crossing, the controlled animal may be dif- ferent from the animals of other McCarthy texts, but the controller is al- ways the same. Works Cited Bell, James.
