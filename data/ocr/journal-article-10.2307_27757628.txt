The 18th century saw an immense enlargement of European hor izons in space and time: explorations of the more exotic parts of the Earth; ascent of some of its highest mountains; probing of the lower atmosphere in balloons; mapping of galactic and extragalactic space; extension of the estimated age of the Earth from thousands to millions of years. These changes were both cause and effect of the emergence of new scientific disciplines, notably archeology, probability theory, hsps, 19:2 (1989)</page><page sequence="2">350 geology, and biology (in the sense of a unified approach to the study of living beings). As for the older sciences, physics (in the modern sense) by the century's end had become mathematized, fully experimental, and on its way to full professionalization; chemistry would soon fol low; and the study of living beings admitted novel ideas about orderly inheritance and the transformation of species, and substituted innova tively organicist for traditional mechanistic approaches to nature. Until fairly recently, historians of science have neglected this cor nucopia of significant developments. Why? Was it written off as a period of stock taking and consolidation between the dizzyingly rapid advances of the 17th and 19th centuries? Or because it contained few figures whose names are attached to scientific "revolutions"? Or be cause, following the lead of political and social historians, historians of science have shrunk the century by a quarter, and conceived it to run from 1715 to 1789?1 Here as elsewhere periodization is no trivial matter, as the following examples should make clear. Guerlac accepts 1715 as the year "with which, to all intents and purposes, the eighteenth century was ushered in,"2 and mentions pol itical events that marked the opening?the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the death of Queen Anne in 1714, and the death of Louis XIV in 1715. What has it to do with Guerlac's topic, the reasons for the de layed acceptance of Newton's theory of color in France? Guerlac claims that starting in about 1714 there emerged a more rigorous stan dard for experimental demonstrations, exemplified in Desaguliers' re petitions before the Royal Society that year of nine of the prism ex periments in Newton's Opticks. They were "an early example of that painstaking description of the conditions and disposition of an experi ment now expected in reports of scientific results so that they can be readily confirmed or 'falsified.'"3 Guerlac offers another reason for re garding the years around 1715 as significant for his topic as well as for European politics. "The accession of George I brought embassies of congratulation from the chief countries of Europe, and in their train, disguised as secretaries of mission, came a small platoon of scientific personages curious to see the great Newton, to attend meetings of the Royal Society, and.. .to observe an eclipse of the sun which promised to be visible in its totality at London, on 22 April 1715."4 Among the visitors were three members of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1.

Their positive report to their colleagues in Paris was especially important because Newton's Opticks was not yet published in French (that occurred in Amsterdam in 1720 and Paris in 1722). Also among the foreign visitors to Lon don in 1715 was the secretary to the Dutch embassy, W.J.'sGraves ande, who met Newton and Desaguliers and, perhaps in consequence, became one of the leading Continental Newtonians. We may grant therefore that 1715 marks the beginning of the diffusion of "Newtonianism"?at least in optics?to Continental Europe. But this hardly warrants any inference as to the significance of this year for other scientific developments, whether in England or on the Con tinent. Turning next to the other key date in the truncated 18th century, McClellan writes that "the French Revolution would bring the whole edifice [of scientific societies] down."5 The assertion is dubious. Ac cording to Hufbauer, even during the unsettled period between 1795 and 1815, there were "substantial improvements in material support for the science [of chemistry] in schools and academies in Berlin, Er langen, Freiberg, G?ttingen, Jena, Kiel, Marburg, Munich, and Prague."6 And yet McClellan constructs his valuable account of scientific societies as if the terminal year 1793 is equally appropriate for all of them. In France, where the Revolutionaries systematically abolished learned societies, it makes perfect sense to terminate a description of the relations between science and the French state with the end of the Old Regime.7 It is always hazardous to postulate identi cal effects in widely separated regions stemming from a single set of causes. Leaving historical time now for historical space, I suggest that by 1800 at the latest the largest significant unit had become the terrestrial globe itself: During the 18th century Europe interacted with the rest of the globe in ways of utmost significance for Western science. One result of these interactions was a change in attitudes toward ethnic and cultural diversity. As Marshall and Williams point out, "Men were now able to seek explanations of their own society in a much wider continuum of time and space."8 5. J.E.

Source: McClellan (ref. 5), 67. One other quantitative aspect of the 18th century deserves recogni tion here. Europe's population grew at a rate without precedent: slow but steady before midcentury and dramatically rapid thereafter (roughly, 120 million in 1700, 140 million in 1750, and 180-190 mil lion in 1800.) The rate varied from place to place: There was no in crease at all in the Dutch Netherlands, a near doubling in England and Wales, Prussia, and Sweden, and a trebling or even quadrupling in Russia and Hungary; France, already densely populated at the begin ning of the century, increased by 30%, from 20 million to 26 million.9 These spectacular increases derived apparently from a reduction in the mortality rate. When the causes for the decline in mortality rate are better understood, the connections of demographic with other histori cal developments, including developments in science, should become clearer. Even now it is hard to deny that "The decline in mortality rates since 1700 is one of the greatest events of human history."10 9. Woloch (ref. 1), 107-108, or Anderson (ref. 1), 73. 10.

Rousseau and Roy Porter. In their programmatic and provocative introduction, they describe a revolution they see underway among historians of sci ence in terms of contextualist, externalist, Marxist, structuralist, and similarly novel approaches, many of which challenge the authority and hegemony of institutionalized science.11 Rousseau and Porter have every right to emphasize what they see as the most promising direc tions for current research in 18th-century science. But they have missed the point of the remark by Susan Cannon, deploring the state of scholarship on the subject, with which they open their discussion. Cannon laments the lack of "hard" history of science for the 18th cen tury, of a body of well established results on which a 19th century his torian like herself might build with confidence. What she had in mind, and wanted, appears from her single example, the gap in our knowledge of what happened in optics between Newton and Young. 1. ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM As Rousseau and Porter were writing, one gap in our knowledge of 18th century physics was being filled by the superb researches of Heil bron and Home on electricity and magnetism.12 Home's work is the more traditional in that it consists of a substantial monograph on the life and scientific achievements of one man, F.U.T. Aepinus; the monograph precedes Connor's translation of Aepinus' most important work. Nevertheless, Home covers some unfamiliar ground, as well as the work of the Eulers, Leonhard (father) and Johann Albrecht (son), on electricity, and Aepinus' dual career, first as a member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences and later as a courtier and civil ser vant. "Aepinus' activities at the College of Foreign Affairs illustrate one fascinating yet generally unrecognized way in which mathematical talents were put to use in the eighteenth century, since the post he oc cupied within the College was head of the Cipher Department."13 11.

Home and P.J. Connor, Aepinus's essay on the theory of electricity and magnetism (Princeton, 1979). A later book by Heilbron, Elements of ear ly modern physics (Berkeley, 1982), reprints the first two chapters of the earlier book and adds a third chapter summarizing the history of electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries. 13. Home and Connor (ref. 12), 54.</page><page sequence="6">354 Aepinus' scientific activities often collided with those of Mikhail Lomonosov (1711-1765). In Home's account of the numerous con frontations between the two men, Aepinus turns out to have been more often in the right; the opposite conclusion emerges, not surpris ingly, from a recent Soviet hagiography of Lomonosov.14 From a modern point of view, Lomonosov's main failing in science was the rejection of a mathematical approach to the study of nature. That would make him an unlikely contributor to optics. Yet he has been put forward as an anticipator of Thomas Young's three color theory of vision and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light.15 Lomonosov's misguided criticism of Newton's theory of light and color on the ground that there are three rather than seven primary colors hardly anticipated Young, and Lomonosov's vague doctrine that the ether conducts both light and electricity bears no significant resemblance to Maxwell's theory. Lomonosov's most successful deal ing with light was his revival of the medieval art of mosaics by developing methods for the production of glass in colors other than the traditional green and blue.16 Heilbron also treats Aepinus in detail and, like Home, gives a relevant account of the Eulers' theory of electricity, paying special at tention to what he calls the "heady and irrelevant mathematics" of the Eulers' hydrodynamic analogy. He adds a summary of the "feeble" ideas of Paolo Frisi, who came in second to Johann Albrecht Euler in the 1754 competition on electricity sponsed by the Petersburg Academy. By contrast to both Euler and Frisi, Heilbron goes on, "Ae pinus owed his success to strict adherence to the program of the Prin cipia, which he read as an applied mathematician."17 With the back ground Heilbron has provided, "Newtonianism" as an influential pro gram in 18th-century physics becomes a useful historical category in stead of an empty label. That Aepinus' Essay itself did not begin to become influential until several decades after its publication tells us something vital about what was happening in physics toward the end of the 18th century: In Home's words: "Only when mathematics and experiment combined in the last years of the eighteenth and the first 14.

An illustration of this admirable interrelated ness is Heilbron's analysis of the several factors that helped make Franklin such an outstanding scientist. To begin with, there was his discipline as a printer, with its requirements of "the coordination of head and hand, familiarity with wood and metal, exactness, neatness, dispatch." Again, "His success in building up his business and shaping his community, in mastering people and machines, supported his characteristic optimism, the expectation that he could control or cajole his environment."20 And finally, "In his first published work, A disser tation on liberty and necessity, pleasure and pain (1725), he considered the freedom of the will using terms he later found convenient for clas sifying sparks."21 Two general aspects of Heilbron's book have not perhaps been sufficiently appreciated. The first concerns his printed sources. (Heil bron also lists a couple of dozen manuscript sources in his bibliogra phy.) There is a satisfying completeness or closure about the printed sources, suggested by Heilbron's remark that he has examined the publications of the three hundred odd writers on electricity between 1600 and 1790, "whose publications are noticed in the catalogs of the world's great collections." From this group of so-called electricians Heilbron selects for special study those writers, some 210 in all, "who made significant contributions to the understanding of electrical phenomena."22 In eliminating the insignificant writers, Heilbron ap 18. Home and Connor (ref. 12), 224. 19. Cf. Heilbron's remark (in Rousseau and Porter (ref. 11), 359) that Wolfs History of science, technology, and philosophy in the 18th century (first published in 1938, re edited by Douglas McKie in 1952, reprinted in 1961, and now out of print) "contains the best recent general account of eighteenth-century physics with which I am acquaint ed." 20. Heilbron, Elements (ref. 12), 187-188. 21. Ibid., 189-190. Only this last factor is briefly discussed in Heilbron, Electricity (ref. 12), 329, n. 14. 22. Ibid., 98.</page><page sequence="8">356 peals to the criterion of their contributions to the understanding of electrical phenomena. That "understanding" is some appropriate combination of both contemporary and retrospective points of view. Thus, though Heilbron distinguishes Benjamin Franklin among all other 18th century electricians by referring to "The Age of Franklin" (the title of Part Four of his book), he can be quite critical of some of Franklin's ideas. Franklin appealed to the analogy of pulling hairs from a horse's tail in order to explain why pointed conductors can so readily draw off electric fire from a charged body. Heilbron com ments: "This reasoning would not earn its author high marks in phy sics even in the eighteenth century."23 Here, Franklin's ideas are held up against an 18th century consensus about good reasoning in physics. But if Franklin's ideas sometimes fall below that consensus, Aepinus' ideas sometimes rise far above it (as a result of "too much mathemat ics, magnetism, Latin, and detail for most electricians of the eighteenth century"),24 and here Heilbron perforce uses a retrospective standard in praising Aepinus' work. The second aspect of Heilbron's book is stylistic. Most reviewers have praised Heilbron's literary gifts and especially his witty, occa sionally even brilliantly epigrammatic, style. What I wish to point out is that Heilbron's wit serves not merely to lighten the strenuous effort of reading his long and complicated book but also frequently as an im plicit mode of evaluating his material. For example, in describing some magnetic measurements of J.H. van Swinden, "a great admirer of Newton as a methodologist," Heilbron both illustrates his point that "in respect of exactness of measurement, which constitutes the basis of quantitative physics, a great change occurred during the latter eighteenth century" and expresses doubt whether mere accumulation of measurements is always worthwhile: "Our methodologist van Swin den likewise recommended sedulous attention to exact observation, and supplied a heroic example by measuring the magnetic variation every hour of every day for ten years."25 In sum, both by its principles of selection and emphasis and by certain features of its style Heilbron's book displays the continuing presence of a controlling and evaluating authorial intelligence. 23.

Though the observa tions were made in hopes of establishing a (non-existent) correlation between weather and public health, the resulting data have enabled modern meteorologists to deduce Eu ropean weather patterns during the period in question; see John Kington, The weather of the 1780s over Europe (Cambridge, 1988), 5-13.</page><page sequence="9">357 2. LIGHT Geoffrey Cantor purports to provide a more sophisticated account of 18th century optics than has hitherto been available, which means, in his words, "to present the eighteenth century in terms of the prob lems and perceptions of the writers themselves." Cantor contrasts his account with that of William Whewell (still the received view, accord ing to Cantor, though formulated 150 years ago), whose main thesis was that under the baleful influence of Newton's corpuscular theory of light no significant advances in optics occurred for a century. But, as Cantor points out, Joseph Priestley, in his The history and present state of discoveries relating to vision, light and colours (1772) had al ready "pointed to recent research into photometry, the action of phos phorescent substances, attempts to measure the momentum of light, the theories of transparency, diffraction and dispersion, work on halos and parhelia, explanations of distance perception and a host of other phenomena."26 Unfortunately, Cantor's narrowly conceived theme? "beliefs about the nature of light.. .in natural philosophical con texts"27 ?could very well reinforce Whewell's thesis because his own account shows little significant change in theories of light until Fresnel's work in the 19th century. Choice of subject matter is not Cantor's only dubious self-imposed restriction. There is also his ex clusion of Continental optical theorists, some of whom, however, re fuse to disappear because they are the authors of three of his four theories of light! These are the projectile (the corpuscles of Newton's Opticks of 1704); the fluid (Boerhaave's fire, known in Britain through his A new method of chemistry of 1727); the vibration (Euler's longitu dinal aethereal waves, from his Nova theoria lucis et colorum of 1746; and the wave (Fresnel's transverse aethereal waves, which flooded the British Isles during the 1820s and 1830s). Cantor claims that his improved taxonomy has revealed that the projectile theory had serious rivals in Britain: 22 fluidists (e.g., John Hutchinson, Samuel Pike, Duncan Forbes, and William Jones), 10 vi brationists (e.g., Abraham Bennet, Benjamin Franklin, and Gowin Knight), 67 projectionists (e.g., John Desaguliers, Richard Helsham, Thomas Melvil, Robert Smith, and Joseph Priestley). Cantor presents his dramatis personae in a useful table that indicates their education and profession. Another table compares the four theories themselves with respect to means of dissemination, audience, and aptness for mathematical formulation. The projectile and vibration theorists were 26. G.N.

FIG. 2 Reflection and refraction, Robert Smith, A compleat system of opticks (1738). Source: Cantor (ref. 26), 41. An undesirable consequence of Cantor's revisionist historiography is that both Huygens and Young become anomalous when they should be central. "The position of Huygens is not germane to the present argument."28 Proceeding from this proposition, Cantor never ade quately brings out the significance for both Young and Fresnel of Hu ygens' analysis of double refraction and of Laplace's and Malus' ac commodation of this analysis to the projectile theory.29 Their achieve ments in 1809/10 may well have made possible Fresnel's success in formulating a wave theory of diffraction in 1818. At first, in his isola tion outside Paris, Fresnel's ignorance of their work meant that he could not be inhibited by the enormous prestige and power of the French proponents of the projectile theory.30 Later, however, it was 28. Ibid., 15. 29. Cantor refers to this work of Laplace and Malus but says little about it (ibid., 150-151).

"Fresnel," 167.</page><page sequence="11">359 this very prestige and power that led the Academy of Sciences to pro pose in 1818 the prize competition on diffraction, which, to the surprise of Laplace and his followers, Fresnel eventually won. Cantor characterizes the allusion to Huygens in Young's first major exposition of his interference principle as part of "a convoluted discourse with the past" whose "aim was to show the plausibility of the vibration theory at a time when projectile theorists although begin ning to acknowledge the bankruptcy of their own theory were unwil ling to consider seriously its rival."31 This interpretation is forced. After high praise for Newton and an attempt to enlist the support of some of Newton's ideas on optics for the vibration theory, suddenly, at the end of his lengthy paper, Young accuses Newton of departing from his "usual accuracy and candour" in his attempts to correct Hu ygens' "most elegant and ingenious theory" of double refraction.32 Young's obeisance to Huygens seems genuine and straightforward. It is perhaps relevant here that in the same volume in which his own pa per appeared, a friend of Young's, William Wollaston, reported exper iments on double refraction performed at Young's suggestion, which confirmed Huygens' law for the phenomenon rather than Newton's.33 Later, Young returned to Huygens' theory of double refraction in a critique of Laplace's explanation of double refraction. Laplace began with Huygens' application of Fermat's principle of least time to the movement of light rays through a transparent crystal, which yielded the spheroidal construction corresponding to the experimentally deter mined law of extraordinary refraction. Laplace then applied the correlate of Fermat's principle for material points (Maupertuis' princi ple of least action), which was known to govern the motions of materi al points, subjected to attractive and repulsive forces. Laplace con cluded that such forces acted on the material point representing the light ray. That was not to achieve much. As Young pointed out, "M. Laplace has.. .given himself much trouble to prove that coincidence in a particular case, which must necessarily be true in all possible cases."34 The real problem for Laplace was to discover a plausible law of force. 31.

Such a structure of the elementary atoms of the crystal may be understood by comparing them to a block of wood or of mica." Young then offered a geometrical demonstration of the proposition that " 'an impulse is propagated through every per pendicular section of a lamellar elastic substance in the form of an el liptic undulation.'" It remained for the "undulation" theory to ex plain polarization phenomena, about which Young had this to say: "an undulation, which has passed through a crystal, is not, as some authors have taken for granted, alike on all sides; nor can it be proved, that the difference of its curvature, in its different sections, may not be sufficient to produce all the observable modifications of its subsequent subdivision."35 No doubt this last statement is unsatisfactorily vague. Young ap pears to have recognized that it did not authorize a strong claim for the wave theory.36 .. it must be remembered, that we have been considering a single class of phenomena only; the two rival theories must be viewed in a multipli city of various lights, before a fair estimate can be candidly formed of their comparative merits; and we are not arguing for a decision in favour of either, but for a temperate suspension of judgment, until more complete and more satisfactory evidence can be obtained. Whatever Young may have felt earlier, he cannot at this point be described, as Cantor describes him, as "complacently convinced that he had found a true law of nature."37 Cantor classifies Young as a vibration theorist with the difference that he exploited the "principle of interference." According to Cantor, Young's optical work was not given a more favorable reception between 1800 and 1820 because the principle of interference was ei ther too novel to be easily understood or too tainted by its association with "a long-exploded and methodologically unsound theory of light [the vibration theory]."38 Either way, Young's reputation as a creative scientist suffers. He is either a disciple of Euler's "of moderate com petence" or the originator of a principle of interference much less gen 35. Ibid., 228-229. 36. Ibid., 232. 37. Cantor (ref. 26), 140. 38. Ibid., 146.</page><page sequence="13">361 eral and rigorous than Fresnel's.39 Cantor gives Young little credit for recognizing the possibility of a transverse vibration to explain polari zation, because he "did not elaborate on this suggestion" and "shied away from its physical implications, whereas by 1821 Fresnel had committed himself to transverse vibrations."40 This is to undervalue not only the context but also the effect of Young's recognition. In a letter now lost of April 29, 1818 to Arago, Young elaborated his suggestion to the extent of comparing the aether to a long vibrating string.41 This analogy stimulated Fresnel to take up once more his own inadequate transverse wave hypothesis of 1816; and, having final ly proved in 1820 that Young's analogy could hold for a liquid, Fresnel published his first formulation of the hypothesis in 1821.42 In Cantor's revisionist historiography, as Young's status goes down, that of his harshest critic, Henry Brougham, goes up. Cantor himself cites two egregious instances of Brougham's failure to under stand straightforward optical texts.43 The more shocking of these con cerns an unproblematic passage of Newton's Opticks (Prop. Ill, Part One, Book I), which points out that the more refrangible rays are more reflexible, i.e., they are totally reflected sooner as the prism is ro tated. Brougham comments: "That the demonstration involves a logi cal error appears pretty evident."44 The logical error is entirely Brougham's in failing to note what Newton meant by "reflexibility." Brougham's comment concluded a paper in which he claimed to have experimentally overturned the universality of the law of reflection! Cantor scarcely raises an eyebrow in describing Brougham's modified law of reflection, which has the angle of reflection depend on the color of the ray in certain circumstances.45 Cantor interprets Brougham's attack on Young as proceeding not from personal animosity but from commitment to a Scottish methodo logical tradition intensely skeptical of physical hypotheses such as 39.

Cantor points out that Brougham adopt ed Thomas Reid's extreme skepticism characteristic of an earlier gen eration of Scottish thinkers rather than the more balanced methodolo gy of Brougham's "contemporaries in the Edinburgh scientific com munity."46 This hardly strengthens the case for Brougham's scientific perspicacity. It is good to rehabilitate thinkers whose reputations have been unfairly impugned; but Brougham does not meet the fair ness test. Cantor also tries to rehabilitate the 18th century fluid theorists of light. It is not clear why, since few of them "were concerned with ex plaining the standard optical phenomena of reflection, refraction and flection [diffraction],"47 and all of them opposed mathematical formu lations. They were concerned not with the science of optics, but with the sun as the source of light?and as the physical counterpart of the first person of the Trinity?and with the Bible as the key to under standing nature. The earliest text expounding a fluid theory of light was John Hutchinson's Moses's principia (1724-27), an all-out attack on Newton's scientific and theological doctrines. Cantor correctly judges that Hutchinson's "rather undeveloped views on physical optics added nothing substantive to the subject;" nonetheless, "his writings are of historical importance because they illustrate the way in which optics could be subsidiary to the wider concerns of revealed theology and the divine economy of nature." Cantor's justification for admit ting the fluidists and not other light metaphysicians is that fluid theor ists always formulated their speculations in natural scientific?as op posed to poetic or aesthetic?contexts; and that certain of them, such as Peter Leslie, Bryan Higgins, and William Jones, made experimental investigations of fire, which they took to be closely related to light.48 By attending to the fluid theorists, Cantor thinks that he is avoid ing the "Whiggism of the standard account" while avoiding "the ex treme of portraying all beliefs as equally important." But this is not very persuasive. The fluid theorists in Cantor's sample were highly marginal to the main scientific community of 18th century Britain and Ireland: only 14% were members of the Royal Society (compared with 53% of the projectile theorists and 70% of the vibration theorists), and only six or seven fluidists on whom data are available were profession ally associated with the natural sciences or medicine. Fluid theorists engaged in a radically different enterprise from the other groups. And Cantor, in a later publication, seems to recognize this truth when he contrasts two modes of discourse about light, one subscribing to a 46. Ibid., 85. 47. Cantor (ref. 26), 91. 48. Ibid., 102-103.</page><page sequence="15">363 Lockean theory of language and the other opposing it.49 The former mode, which sees language as entirely conventional, was practiced by both projectile and wave theorists, while the latter mode, which sees language?or, at least some language?as endowed with magical powers was practiced by such writers as William Law and John Hutchinson.50 Linguistically speaking at least, the work of the fluid theorists was in commensurable with that of the other light theorists. Once again, however, Cantor blurs this incommensurability by suggesting that the anti-Lockean mode of optical discourse is "richer."51 Since Cantor decided to include the fluidists, it is unfortunate that he did not consider William Blake's conception of light. Possibly through the influence of William Law, Blake's descriptions of light sometimes resemble theirs but are expressed with far greater poetic in tensity. In a later essay, however, Cantor refers briefly to a poem by Blake in which the projectile conception of light seems to occur.52 Be cause the fluid constituting light was often thought of as a flow of par ticles, literary descriptions of the two theories tend to be similar. The (untitled) poem, dating from the period 1800-1806, begins, "Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau," and includes the lines "And Newton's Particles of light/Are sands upon the Red sea shore."53 Cantor finds a source for Blake's sand metaphor in a book on natural theology by Bernard Nieuwentijdt, which was translated into English by Desagu liers and published in 1718/9.54 Now, in 1800 Blake wrote a poetic letter to Thomas Butts, which begins, "To my friend Butts/My first Vision of Light/On the yellow sands sitting."55 The intense experience of sunlight sitting on a beach was perhaps more important than any thing Blake might have read for the composition of "Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau." 49. See Cantor (ref. 26), 92 and Cantor, "Light and Enlightenment: An exploration of mid-eighteenth-century modes of discourse," in The discourse of light from the Mid dle Ages to the Enlightenment (Los Angeles, 1985), 69-106, on 70. 50. Law was "a nonjuring theologian who from the mid-1730s until his death in 1761 was the principal British exponent of Jacob Boehme's mystical philosophy" (Can tor (ref. 49), 76). Law does not figure in Cantor's Optics after Newton, presumably be cause his discussions of light do not occur in natural-philosophical contexts. 51. Cantor (ref. 49), 91. 52.

This happened when various natural philosophers (Cantor mentions four) cited Nieuwentijdt's "pseudo-calculation" of the im mense number of particles of light emitted per second by a burning candle but omitted the original natural theological context, thereby "legitimating" the scientific status of the calculation. It would be better to say that the calculation was not transformed from illegiti mate to legitimate, but only changed its significance as it shifted from one context (or discursive mode) to another; and better not to talk of the "blurring" of the boundaries between the two contexts. The exam ple provides only the frailest of supports for Cantor's grandiose thesis concerning "the theological origin of many eighteenth-century optical metaphors and thus the theological underpinnings of optical discourse."56 Cantor's other examples of the role of optical metaphors in scientific contexts involve the comparison of light particles with can non balls, and attempts to measure the momentum of light. The point of the ballistic metaphor in theological contexts was that cannon balls travelled much faster than any other man-made bodies and yet far slower than light; hence, God was infinitely more powerful than man. Again, unlike Cantor, I see here not a blurring of theological and scientific contexts but merely diverse applications in different contexts of a particular claim about the speed of light.57 We thus come neatly to the dispute about the results of so-called crucial experiments designed to measure the "weight" (momentum) of light and thereby decide between the projectile and vibration theories. Cantor questions whether the best way to view these experiments is "as offering a means of testing scientific theories" because the ap paratus itself could only be interpreted as "the reification of a meta phor," that is, the introduction of the instruments of mechanics into the optical laboratory. The experimental reports?whether claiming to detect momentum (John Michell's of the 1750s, unpublished until 1772) or not (Abraham Bennet's published in 1792)?were singularly unconvincing, because, according to Cantor, of their basically meta phorical nature. "The experiments and experimental reports, then, take on a symbolic role, articulating the known rather than offering a crucial test."58 Now, in the 1780s Coulomb was using his torsion bal 56.

Claiming to have found such a law, Coulomb initially managed to persuade only his French colleagues.59 Was this because of "the reification of a metaphor" in Coulomb's apparatus? But perhaps use of the torsion balance did not constitute a transference of apparatus from the "mechanics" to the "electricity" laboratory? Beyond issues of language and modes of discourse, there is the ur gent practical and subtle methodological question of how to select a sample of texts on which to base a history of optics or any of its branches. We recall Heilbron's criterion for inclusion in his history of electricity: all writers "who made significant contributions to the understanding of electrical phenomena." Does this criterion leave out any writers on electricity of possible historical interest? I think it does, and quite properly so. There were, for example, writers who described various forms of electric therapy; of the six discussed in a recent publication,60 only two, Ledru (pseudonym: Comus) and Bertholon, receive fleeting references in Heilbron's book and not for their work in medicine. (The other four were Mauduyt, Thourry, Thouvenel, and Bachaumont.) The topic of electricity and medicine as a whole is barely touched on by Heilbron for what I take to be the sufficient reason that investigations in this area did not lead to in creased understanding of electrical phenomena?by 18th century stan dards. Thus, Heilbron's only extended discussion of electricity and medicine concerns Nollet, whose electrical theory was the most widely accepted throughout Europe before Franklin's. Nollet was skeptical about electric therapy. In 1749 he made a triumphant tour of Italy in the course of which he "cut a swath through miracle mongers from Turin to Naples."61 Cantor discusses the "practical issue[s].. .of.. .the location of ap propriate source material," explicitly noting that, by contrast with "the field of electricity, which gave rise to a plethora of monographs during the latter half of the eighteenth century..., specialist works on light were few and far between." He decided to examine not just the textbooks on optics published in the British Isles during the 18th cen tury (some nine in all), but also publications on vision; textbooks on natural philosophy; dictionaries, works on theology, philosophy, chem istry, and electricity; and manuscripts, presumably on any of the sub jects previously mentioned.62 Apparently, he applied no criteria of 59.

Instead, he classified these highly heterogeneous materials according to his four theories of light. While this procedure some times produced interesting sociological generalizations, it also contri buted to the historiographical weaknesses discussed above. 3. GEOLOGY Optics has existed as a recognized subject for over 2000 years. Yet there are difficulties in demarcating its boundaries and thereby select ing texts relevant to the composition of its history during the 18th century. One can expect difficulties even more severe in attempts to write the history of a science from its origins. Rachel Laudan does well to begin her book with a justification of the two key terms of her title and with a general analysis of the aims and methods of early modern geology. "Mineralogy" meant in the 17th and 18th centuries the study of "all the naturally occurring, nonliving, solid objects on the globe (and in some systems, fluids as well)."63 Minerals were generally further classified as metals, earths and stones, salts, and sulfurs (or bitumens or inflammables), and also, on the basis of their spatial configurations in the earth, as rocks, veins, and strata.64 By 1774 Werner could identify mineralogy with the study of the classification, distribution, formation, and history of the four types of mineral substances, and so the scope of mineralogy had come closer to that of modern geology. But the transition from mineralogy so understood to geology in the modern sense required clarification or even redefinition of the aims and methods of the discipline of?what shall we call it? The term "geology" has been viewed as misleadingly anachronistic because it only came into use during the early 19th cen tury. Laudan judges the allegedly less anachronistic terms recently in troduced by other historians to be at least equally problematic. Thus Jordanova and Porter's preferred terms?"earth sciences" or "environ mental sciences"?far from merely "denoting] the objects of study," "were invented in the 1960s in order to reformulate the boundaries of geology so as to accomodate new sources of funding associated with the space race and oceanographic exploration and new sensibilities as sociated with the environmental movement."65 63. Laudan, From mineralogy to geology: The foundations of a science, 1650-1830 (Chicago, 1987), 21. The Encyclopedie (1765) defines "mineral regne" as "1'assemblage total des corps qui appartiennent ? la terre, et qui se forment dans son sein," 10, 534. 64. Laudan, Mineralogy (ref. 63), 22-28. 65. Ibid., 229-230, n. 1.</page><page sequence="19">367 Terminology alone can rarely provide criteria for the historical identity of a science, and so Laudan turns to aims and methods. Rehearsing her own personal history as an undergraduate student of geology, she discerns in her historical materials the same duality of aims and methods evidently present in contemporary geology. One aim is historical ("geology should describe the development of the earth from its earliest beginnings to its present form"), the other causal ("geology should lay out the causes operating to shape the earth and to produce its distinctive objects"). These two aims have been pursued in relative independence of one another, resulting in quite different sorts of basic concepts; for example, historical geology em ploys "formations," defined by Werner as "the collection of rocks formed during a certain period," whereas causal geology prefers "na tural kinds," such as basalt and feldspar. As for the methods of geolo gy, Laudan thinks these have scarcely changed since the late 18th cen tury; they include enumerative induction, analogy, and the vera causa method. (The methods of hypothesis and eliminative induction were largely discredited by the early 19th century.)66 The larger portion of Laudan's compact, clearly written, and fairly well illustrated book consists of a narrative history of leading minera logical, cosmogonical, and geological theories from the mid-17th to the early 19th century. Laudan considers the chemical cosmogonies of the Becher-Stahl school as most important of the early theories be cause they fed into what is for her the mainstream work of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749-1817). Seeking to undermine the traditional historiography of geology, which takes Werner's influence to have been largely pernicious?a view that can be traced back to Archibald Geikie's The founders of geology (1902) and thence to Charles Lyell's Principles of geology (1830-1833)?Laudan devotes a chapter to Werner and the two divergent subgroups of geologists (one primarily historical, one primarily causal) which constitute, in Laudan's phrase, the "Wernerian radiation." She also devotes a chapter to the subse quent history of each branch of this radiation. (Laudan admits that Wernerians differed widely among themselves but insists that they shared a common attachment to "a very substantial portion of Werner's theory.")67 Werner taught many of the leading geologists of the early 19th cen tury at the mining academy in Freiberg, Saxony; Wernerians dominat ed geology in the areas of teaching, textbooks, and journals; and Werner's influence extended to France, England, Scotland, the United 66. Ibid., 2, 6, 7-16. 67. Ibid., 107.</page><page sequence="20">368 States, and Mexico. In 1829 Elie de Beaumont (1798-1874) effected a synthesis of historical and causal geology in his elevation theory of mountain formation, which retained the Wernerian historical ap proach but replaced Wernerian chemical causation with his own variety of physical causation. So, concludes Laudan, "The [Werneri an] program that had directed geological research for half a century was replaced by one with different foundations, a different attitude to ward causes, and a much more catastrophist interpretation of the his tory of the earth."68 This new synthesis might have been more influential than Lyell's slightly later (and opposed) synthesis. We can not know until much more historical research has been done on 19th century geology. Three of the ten chapters in Laudan's book deal with bywaters re lative to mainstream Wernerianism. Chapter 4, "The botanical model rejected," describes attempts to apply Linnaean taxonomic principles to mineralogy by classifying minerals on the basis of their external characteristics. (Linnaeus himself proposed counting the number of faces in crystalline minerals.) Most mineralogists, however, preferred chemical principles of classification, though continuing, like Werner, to use external characteristics for identification. Laudan concludes this chapter with some sensible remarks directed against those who, like Thomas Kuhn and Mary Hesse, think preoccupation with classificatory procedures is the mark of an immature science, and those who, like Michel Foucault, think such a preoccupation charac teristic of a particular period (1660-1800) in European thought. Lau dan rightly takes modern geology to be a powerful counterexample to both of these theses. Chapter 6, "The Huttonian alternative," shows how radically James Hutton (1726-1797) differed from members of the Becher Stahl-Werner tradition. Hutton insisted on a theologically grounded (deistic) cyclic causal theory of the earth as opposed to the genetic or historical unidirectional theories of the chemical cosmogonists (which, when theologically grounded at all, could be either Christian or deistic in character); and he constructed his causal geological theory on the basis of Boerhaavian heat theory rather than Stahlian chemistry. For her evaluation of Hutton's work Laudan expresses her indebtedness to half a dozen scholars of the 1960s and 1970s, who "discredited once and for all the notion that Hutton eschewed speculation and placed him firmly within the cosmogonic tradition." Her own conclusion is that "Hutton made a limited but significant contribution to causal geology which his successors recognized. But the Huttonian position 68. Ibid., 200.</page><page sequence="21">369 was distinctly a minority one in the thirty years following his death."69 FIG. 3 Hutton's interpretation of the structure of the Isle of Arran as a core of granite surrounded by flanking sedimentary rocks, watercolor by John Clerk or his son (1787). Source: Laudan (ref. 63), 130. Laudan's revaluation of Hutton leads her to a revaluation of Lyell. In her penultimate chapter, "Lyell's geological logic," Laudan argues that the coolness with which both British and continental geologists greeted LyelFs work can be explained partly as a result of his relentless demand for a strict vera causa methodology and partly as a result of his failure to construct a convincing theory of elevation.70 Laudan's most provocative formulation of the thesis of her book comes in her "Postscript:"71 I believe that geology came of age in the late eighteenth century, not the early nineteenth, in the context of developments within mineralogy rath er than in the context of a new interest in history and the outdoors, and in Germany and continental Europe rather than in Britain. Put in its bluntest form, I believe that the record shows that the Wernerians for mulated the conceptual foundations of geology and dominated its intel lectual and institutional development in the period between 1780 and 1830. I must leave to others the task of deciding how close Laudan comes to proving her case. Two things about her book, however, strike me as exemplary: her deliberate consideration of the methodologies of the texts she is studying and of her own practice as a historian, and her 69. Ibid., 128, 137. Laudan's discussion of Hutton may be usefully supplemented by that of Stephen Jay Gould's Time's arrow time's cycle: Myth and metaphor in the discovery of geological time (Cambridge, MA, 1987). Laudan mentions but chooses not to discuss Hutton's deistic beliefs, whereas Gould, in keeping with his theme, em phasizes just this aspect of Hutton's thought and its implications for his theory of the earth. 70. Once again, Gould's discussion of Lyell usefully supplements Laudan's. Both sort out the shifting meanings of uniformitarianism in LyelFs Principles of geology but Laudan stresses more the logic and Gould more the rhetoric of the book. 71. Laudan, Mineralogy (ref. 63), 224.</page><page sequence="22">370 concern to avoid the parochialism of national histories of geology. She herself recognizes the need for further research on 19th century geology. This research should also include members of the Wernerian radiation, since most of them are characterized by little more than their life spans and the titles of their publications in Laudan's book. 4. MOUNTAINS Mountains became increasingly important to geologists during the course of the 19th century. It was, however, in the 18th century that mountains were not merely discovered but in a way invented as Euro peans began to pay more attention to mountains?moving them, climbing them, contemplating them, depicting them (in words, in pig ments), and speculating about their origin, fate, and structure. Were these various bodily, aesthetic, and intellectual activities connected with one another? A start toward an answer may be obtained from two accounts of the earth's topography (including mountains) com posed about a century apart, and each just recently published for the first time: William Hobbs' "The earth generated and anatomized" (finished about 1715) and some popular geology lectures by Humphrey Davy (delivered in 1806).72 To evaluate properly what Hobbs and Davy say about mountains it helps to know something of the larger in tellectual and social contexts in which they were writing. The little that is known about Hobbs does not include the place or date of his birth. His only other extant writing is his paper, "An essay concerning Motion," which he submitted to the Royal Society in De cember 1708. In May 1709 William Derham read a summary and cri tique of Hobbs' paper. Here is how Derham began: "I have with as much Care in my Opinion as they Deserve read over Mr Hobbs' Pa pers, in which I find him to have a Clear Head, and to be a Person of great Diligence and pretty good Judgment considering his Want of Learning." The paper of 1708 was never published; Hobbs included its contents in his manuscript of 1715. As Porter points out, Hobbs probably never went to a university and he seems to have been ig norant of much of the physics and astronomy of his day.73 In contrast, Davy was a thoroughly professional and distinguished chemist, and his "geological experience by 1805 was sufficient to make his observations on the state of the science worthy of respect, and his 72.

Porter (ref. 72), 12, 6.</page><page sequence="23">371 noninvolvement in the polemical disputes of the time provides us with an account free of committed partisanship."74 Davy's lectures on geology came before any English textbook of geology had been pub lished and may, therefore, have had some influence on the develop ment of geological thought in Britain, and he certainly helped to furth er the subject by joining in the founding of the Geological Society of London in 1807. Nonetheless, Davy deserves no greater prominence than Hobbs in a disciplinary history of 18th century geology. Why, then, should a historian of the subject bother with their ideas about the earth? Because for the purpose at hand?an investigation of that larger context of ideas and cultural practices in which every science is embedded?the non-specialist status of Hobbs and Davy may be an advantage and may make their ideas about mountains of special in terest. Hobbs' title page gives a good summary of his views:75 Wherein is shown What the Chaos was: How and when the Oyster Shells, Cockle-Shells, and all other Marine productions, were brought upon, and incorporated in the Rocks and Mountains of the Earth. Proving that it was not at, or by the Deluge, as is Vulgarly Supposed. Also Why and When the Said Hills and Mountains were raised. To move from chaos to the present constitution of the earth, Hobbs invokes an analogy with the generation of an ostrich in its shell by the sole influence of the sun's heat. Thus, Hobbs postulates that at the center of the earth the sun's heat has engendered a heart, or pulsating source of heat, which is the ultimate cause of the cyclical motion of the tides, the tidal motion in turn causing the rotation of the earth. Hobbs rejects lunar influence as the cause of the tides on the grounds that no medium exists between moon and earth to transmit the influence and that his own tide tables at Weymouth, recorded over a period of three years, do not correlate well with the phases of the moon.76 He also claims that his own observations "in near half the Countys of this Kingdom" are the basis for the generalization that all over the surface of the earth "the Stratas, or rather Beds of Earth; whether it was Level, Hilly, or Mountainious [sic]', were exactly parral lel [sic] to each other." Hobbs somehow infers that "two or three Dayes, before Adam was Created" such strata were parallel to the hor izon, and that the present jumble, in the vicinity of hills and moun 74. Siegfried and Dott (ref. 72), xiii, xvii. 75. Porter (ref. 72), 36-37. 76. Porter (ref. 72), 18, points out "Hobbs was not out of date in still puzzling over the issue [of the tides]." Although Porter (ref. 72), 134, n. 166, thinks there is a distinct possibility that Hobbs read Halley's account of the tides in the Philosophical transac tions (1697), Hobbs writes in seeming ignorance of Newtonian gravitation.</page><page sequence="24">372 tains, can only have been caused by "the internall Animateing heat and Motion, within the Earth."77 In all his theorizing Hobbs consistently eschews appeal to Scriptur al authority, though he sometimes cites the Bible as confirming his own explanations. But, of course, Hobbs' cosmology is Christian and therefore teleological throughout. Thus Hobbs justifies the existence of mountains by explaining how the water evaporated from the earth by the sun's heat and the earth's internal heat will flow back to the ocean through the valleys?thereby maintaining what later became known as a "steady state" with respect to the relative proportions of ocean and dry land. This aspect of Hobbs' cosmology reminds one of Hutton:78 Not until new natural philosophies came into vogue associated with men such as Hutton, which were not precisely like Hobbs's but which carried many of the same burdens?the stress upon the activity, and or ganization of the Earth, upon its being transformed gradually and con tinuously, the demotion of Biblical literalism and of miraculous agency?could the study of the Earth actually rediscover many of the important foci of Hobbs's interest. Davy's 1805 lectures on geology take up mountains in connection with primitive rocks, that is, rocks not containing "organic remains" (fossils) and not produced by volcanic activity or deposition from wa ter. Neither the "Huttonian or Plutonic" hypothesis of an igneous origin of primitive rocks nor the "Wernerian or Neptunian" hy pothesis of an alluvial origin satisfied him; indeed, he thought it possi ble that the riddle of their creation "must be forever concealed from us."79 Davy's supposition that there might well be undecidable geolog ical questions derived from his extreme Baconian inductivism, which saw "all the sciences [as] nothing more than expressions of facts." Nevertheless, much of interest concerning primitive rocks remained to be studied, notably "their general uses in the economy of nature." 77. Ibid., 39, 107-108. 78. Ibid., 108, 29. The attribution of functions to mountains in what may be called the "aqueous economy" of the earth has a history going back to Pliny. Thomas Browne, for example, saw mountains as nature's stills, serving to desalinate water and make it potable; see Marjorie Hope Nicolson, Mountain gloom and mountain glory: The development of the aesthetics of the infinite (Ithaca, 1959), 116-117. 79. Siegfried and Dott (ref. 72), 68. Davy uses the opposition between neptunism and vulcanism to characterize the state of geology in his time; recent historians of geolo gy, like Laudan (ref. 63), 223, find such oppositions misleading: "we no longer need to argue, as we did only a couple of decades ago, that categories like 'neptunist,' 'vulcan ist,' 'uniformitarian,' and 'catastrophist,' confuse as much as they clarify in the history of geology." The appropriate terms for analyzing a scientific episode are not always the terms used by participants in the episode.</page><page sequence="25">373 Here he pointed to the role of mountain chains composed of primitive rocks in producing streams that "become in their progress the cause of the fertility of the rich valley and produce the verdure of the cultivat ed plain."80 We are back to Hobbs' economy of nature?now, howev er, definitely anthropomorphic in its teleology.81 Quite a different anthropomorphism of mountains may be found in Thomas Burnet's Sacred theory of the earth. Although Burnet en joyed contemplating mountains almost as much as viewing the starry heavens,82 he recognized in them a sign of the human condition. In Burnet's goal-directed but cyclical view of time and history, moun tains and valleys represent a sinful state physically degraded by the universal deluge; a state preceded by the perfectly spherical shape of sinless Eden, to which the earth will return after the universal conflagration has purged away all sin.83 Burnet saw cycles in the mi crocosm too. "For what is this Life but a Circulation of little mean Actions? We lie down and rise again, dress and undress, feed and wax hungry, work or play, and are weary, and then we lie down again, and the Circle returns."84 A few years after the publication of Burnet's book in English, Joseph Addison was crossing the Alps. They "form one of the most irregular, mis-shapen scenes in the world," he wrote a friend, and "fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror."85 Moreover, they hemmed in his view. "The Mind of Man naturally hates every thing that looks like a Restraint upon it, and is apt to fancy it self under a sort of Confinement, when the Sight is pent up in a narrow Compass, and shortened on every side by the Neighborhood of Walls or Moun 80. Ibid., 39, 70, 72. 81. Equally anthropomorphic was Hutton's idea that, as Mott Greene puts it, "rivers which.. .cut out valleys and broke the rock to soil provided a means whereby plants and animals might find places in which to flourish," Geology in the nineteenth century (Itha ca, 1982), 23. This is just the sort of consideration that John Playfair omitted from his exposition (and modification) of Hutton's views; see Playfair's Illustrations of the Hut tonian theory of the earth (1802; reprint: Urbana, 1956), note xvi. 82.

To improve the view at his Chatsworth estate, he "removed, and perfectly carried away a great mountain that stood in the way, and which interrupted the prospect."87 A recent his torian of the British landscape, Carole Fabricant, sees the willingness to remove natural obstructions as "part of a general demystification of once symbolically rich features of the landscape such as mountains, whereby the latter were divested of their privileged status and became one object among many in the natural world which were vulnerable to the spectator's restless eye and to the estate owner's desire for visual and territorial expansion." This attitude derived, she holds, from an "optimistic faith in a new age of capitalist enterprise and expan sion."88 After the middle of the century, the aggression that moved mountains was challenged increasingly by a sense of awe in the present of "sublime" natural phenomena. Charlton's book extends my inventory of mountain examples to the Continent. Its dust jacket shows a shepherdess and her sheep 86.

The date and theme fit perfectly into Charlton's periodization of European literature (following Van Tieghem): "from about 1730 a gradual rise of interest in mountains; from about 1762 a more em phatic liking for the lower, more pastoral slopes of mountains; from about 1773 an extension of that liking to include the high, deserted mountain peaks." Some examples of landscape representations men tioned by Charlton suggest that a similar progression in attitudes to ward mountains may have occurred in European painting.89 Also noteworthy is the beginning of tourism in the Alps (especially among the British and Germans, far less among the French) and in the Scot tish Highlands; Charlton cites an estimated 1500 visitors (three quarters of whom were British) in 1783 to the Alpine resort of Chamonix near Mont Blanc.90 By the end of the 18th century, both verbal and painted depictions of "high, deserted mountain peaks" (as well as other "sublime" aspects of nature, such as stormy seas) were very much in fashion. These themes dominate Christopher Thacker's The wildness pleases, which, though less systematic than Charlton's book, extends its coverage.91 As history, both books suffer from their concern to identify harbingers of Romanticism. In 1883, when he was fourteen, Ruskin and his parents visited Switzerland. They first saw the Alps just before sunset. "They were clear as crystal, sharp on the pure horizon sky, and already tinged with rose by the sinking sun. Infinitely beyond all that we had ever thought or dreamed,?the seen walls of lost Eden could not have been more beautiful to us; not more awful, round heaven, the walls of sacred Death." Ruskin's historical sense made him add: "the temperament [for appreciating mountains] belonged to the age: a very few years,? within the hundred,?before that, no child could have been born to care for mountains, or for the men that lived among them, in that way."92 Europeans of the 18th century travelled much further afield than the Alps, and published many (usually illustrated) travel books based on their global excursions. Barbara Stafford's massive volume deals with the subgroup of these books "with a natural-history bent." Ac 89. Charlton (ref. 85), 45-46. 90. Ibid., 208, 51. 91.

From these accounts she reproduces 270 illustrations?an invaluable corpus of fascinating and hitherto inaccessible pictures. Stafford pro vides no chronological or geographical classification of either the trav el accounts or the illustrations, and little analysis of the media used by her artist-illustrators. The importance of these media for geological illustration in the period Stafford covers was emphasized in a brilliant essay by Martin Rudwick. He distinguished the special advantages and limitations of copper and steel engraving, watercolor, aquatint, woodcut, and lithograph in developing "a visual language that was ap propriate to the subject-matter of the science, and which could com plement verbal descriptions and theories by communicating observa tions and ideas that could not be expressed in words." For example, "in the early nineteenth century, hand-coloured aquatints became for a time the supreme medium for topographical and natural-history colour-plate books," and "the invention of lithography.. .enabled finely-graded shading and textural detail to be expressed with far more precision and subtlety."94 Stafford's complex and esoteric analytical categories may be exemplified by her accounts of the exploration of mountainous terrain. Sometime during the 18th century, the combination of an intensified interest in matter as matter (consequent on a triumphant Newtonian ism) and a novel ascription of historical meaning to certain large-scale and relatively permanent material configurations (consequent on their being seen as witnesses to the newly conceptualized dynamic earth) led to the idea of a "natural masterpiece." It is typical of the style and construction of Stafford's book that the most succinct and clearest ex planations of these aspects of a "natural masterpiece" occur not in the 93.

"It was mountain scenery.. .rather than the sea or remote lands, that first seriously engaged knowledgeable beholders."96 Europeans first assimilated the scenery of the Alps around 1760, of the Pyrenees during the 1780s.97 But more remote regions were also being explored. Stafford provides pictures of mountains from travel books about Chile (1761), New Zealand (1768), Sandwich Islands (1784), St. Helena (1794), the northwest coast of North America (1797), India (1799), and Egypt (1801). The explorers did not reach the Altai (in Central Asia), Alleghenies, Urals, Andes, or Mexican Sier ras until the early 1800s.98 How convincing a case has been made that in 18th-century moun tain exploration "science and the arts converged on similar conclu sions" and a "strong alliance [existed] between art and science"?99 One answer begins with the observation that among the leading au thors of Alpine travel accounts were such distinguished scientists as J.J. Scheuchzer, Albrecht von Haller, and H.B. de Saussure. Perhaps the most remarkable was Saussure (1740-1799), who spent most of his life after 1760 exploring the geology and natural history of the Alps. His four-volume work, Voyages dans les Alpes (1779-1796), contained engraved illustrations. Rudwick judged those of "mountain scen ery. . .markedly unconvincing." "A comparison with the more ade quate engraving of the gentler environs of Geneva suggests that what was at fault was not so much a lack of skill on the part of de Saussure's artist and engraver, but rather the lack of an appropriate artistic tradition that could cope adequately with the wild irregulari ties of mountain landscapes."100 95.

Hutton quoted long sections of Saussure's Voyages in his Theory of the earth and many geological books in the 19th century reproduced Saussure's dictum that "it is above all the study of mountains which will ac celerate progress in the theory of the earth."102 Stafford explains Saussure's reasoning about the pre-eminence of mountains as fol lows:103 From the standpoint of the investigator of mountains, the plains do not display their constitutive layers except through the chance effects of erosion_From the heights of Mont Blanc or Mount Etna, [Saussure] notes, one can see clearly and grasp immediately the extent rolled out under foot; icy ramparts, subterranean fires, and borderless oceans en gage the natural philosopher standing on top of the world. But Saussure also appreciated the aesthetics of the feelings of "terror" they gave him, which "have a sort of attractiveness which is difficult to resist."104 Stafford sees the research by 18th-century "geognosts and mineralogists" as providing empirical support for Burke's insight that "a perpendicular has more force in forming the sublime than an in clined plane." And, Stafford goes on, "By examining the vertical struc ture of mountains they recognized the signs of sudden upheaval, and by perusing horizontal strata they discerned the serenity of infinite duration."105 This suggests that a common psychology may underlie the attitudes of the late 18th-century spectator, explorer, and scientific investigator of mountains. This psychology may also be reflected in the famous blots of Alexander Cozens. The purpose of Alexander Cozens' A new method of landscape (1785) was to free the imagination of the artist by initiating the work with a blot of ink arising from the application of the following "rule:" "with the swiftest hand make all possible variety of shapes and strokes 101. "Haller went [to the Alps] to collect plant specimens, but the outcome was the first major work of mountain literature, his long poem Die Alpen (1732)." When Saus sure reached the top of Mont Blanc, "He spent his 4 1/2 hours there not, as we might, in viewing the scenery, but in taking readings on his barometers, thermometers, and electrometers, in testing magnetic variations, finding the temperature of boiling water, taking the pulse-rates of others in his party, and so on."

Only three explicitly refer to mountains (1, 2, 9) but, to my eye, at least eight more (3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16) suggest moun tainous formations. Using the Rorschach technique on Cozens' own blots, I would say that he had a powerful unconscious fixation on mountainous landscapes. Unconscious preoccupation with mountains might also be manifested in dreams, such as one of Addison's recount ed by Nicolson.107 Did dreams of mountains become more common during the 18th century? 5. SCIENTIFIC ILLUSTRATION In his recent survey of 18th-century science, Hankins devotes a few carefully composed pages to geology, illustrated by a picture of Mont Blanc from Saussure's Voyages dans les Alpes. He holds that Huttoni an and Wernerian positions had something in common. "Simply put (too simply for complete accuracy), Werner was more like Linnaeus and Hutton was more like Buffon. The differences in their approaches to natural history were more differences of subject and method than differences of belief."108 Elsewhere Hankins is similarly sensitive to the nuances of up-to-date studies of 18th-century science. This may cause difficulties for readers who prefer their history in the form of simple, mnenomically efficient dichotomies; but for imaginative teach ers the occasionally unresolved issues in Hankins' book could provide welcome opportunities for classroom discussion. Several other aspects of the book make it especially accessible and attractive to beginning students of the history of science. The material is arranged, apart from "the moral sciences," according to a recognizably modern classification (mathematics, experimental physics, chemistry, physiolo gy, geology), even though Hankins begins by showing that "eighteenth-century science was not organized in terms of the modern disciplines" and later reinforces the point by reproducing from the Encyclopedie a portion of the tree of knowledge.109 Also on the plus side, Hankins supplies modern explanations for phenomena that puz zled 18th-century investigators (e.g., the so-called barometric light, or the optimal shape for lightning rods); and he enlivens his text with 106.

I trust that the crucial importance of visual documentation is becoming better recognized by historians of science; but for 18th-century science, despite the immense wealth of potentially valuable material, there are few picture books. In the series of attractive, large-format Albums of science edited by LB. Cohen, the pertinent volume contains only 159 18th-century pictures out of a total of 368 illustrations.113 Gillispie's edition of plates from the Encyclopedic on manufacturing and the technical arts gives no place to strictly scientific illustrations.114 The reduced-size but nevertheless legible five-volume reprint of the Encyclopedic reproduces all the plates. My call is not for bare, unannotated pictures. Some indication of the historical context in which a given illustration was produced and seen must be provided if the maximum impact of the illustration? both in its time and for our time?is to be realized. A good example of what is wanted is A hotbed of genius, published in 1986 in connec tion with an exhibition in Edinburgh.115 Only 160 pages long, the volume contains over 180 illustrations, 37 of them in color, and all ex cellently reproduced. There are portraits, cartoons, landscapes, seas capes, architectural subjects, domestic interiors, title pages, and 110. Ibid., 33-36. 111. Ibid., vii.

These last occur particularly in the contributions by R.G.W. Anderson on Joseph Black and by Jean Jones on James Hutton. With respect to their expositions of the purely scientific work of Black and Hutton respectively there is not much to choose between Anderson and Jones on the one hand and, on the other, the corresponding articles by Henry Guerlac and V.A. Eyles in the Dic tionary of scientific biography.ne As introductions to the lives and achievements of Black and Hutton, however, the essays from A hotbed of genius are distinctly superior, in large part because of their illustra tions. Consider first Joseph Black (1728-1799). Guerlac mentions two oil paintings of Black, but reproduces neither, and misses a third, iconographically by far the most interesting, which Anderson gives in color. This half-length portrait shows Black standing behind a table bearing his spectacles, a book and some papers, an empty bird cage, a candle, and several pieces of glass apparatus; he holds a large glass U tube. Anderson also provides photographs of a distilling apparatus, balance and bellows used by Black. These images of Black's apparatus could enable us to refine our comprehension of his experimental work; careful correlation of pictures and verbal accounts would be required, which Anderson does not attempt. Nonetheless, Anderson's illustrat ed account of Black's business ventures and his activities as physician, industrial consultant, and teacher of chemistry not only adds dimen sions to Black's life missing from accounts limited to his purely scientific researches but helps us to reconstruct essential aspects of his historical background in the Scottish Enlightenment.117 Black's busi ness partnership with James Watt and Alexander Wilson (a typefound er who became professor of astronomy at the University of Glasgow) is illustrated by a model Newcomen engine of the kind that stimulated Watt to invent the separate condenser and by a type-specimen sheet from Wilson's foundry; and Black's provision of lead assays for the Earl of Hopetoun is illustrated with a painting of lead production by David Allan. Jean Jones' essay on James Hutton (1726-1797) is unquestionably enhanced by its illustrations. The more important are the geological ones, for example, a color photograph of a boulder of conglomerate 116. In his later article, "Joseph Black's work on heat," in A.D.C. Simpson, ed., Joseph Black 1728-1799: A commemorative symposium (Edinburgh, 1982), 13-22, Guer lac expresses dissatisfaction with all previous expositions (including his own) of Black's work on heat, and freshly expounds it. 117.

Source: Daiches et al. (ref. 115), 127. Jones' treatment of Hutton's geology overemphasizes the opposi tion between Hutton's and Werner's theories and occasionally ap proaches hagiography. "Basing his reasoning on diligent observation" and "bold suppositions," Hutton "freed geological thinking from any restrictions of time scale and laid the foundations of the modern sci ence."120 Eyles' article on Hutton suffers from the same tendency: but he wrote before the revisionist history of geology of the 1970s and 1980s. 6. LAVOISIER AND ENLIGHTENMENT SCIENCE Few historians of science today would wish to dispute the amount of attention that has been lavished in recent years on the quintessen tial Enlightenment figure of Lavoisier. Contemporary Lavoisier stu dies have perhaps entered a new critical phase consequent upon a de bunking phase that reacted to a celebratory phase. First we had La voisier the self-proclaimed maker of a chemical revolution, whose suc tended for the third volume of Hutton's Theory of the earth, the manuscript of which was discovered and published by Frank Dawson Adams in 1899. The drawings turned up in 1968 and have been published in G.Y. Craig, ed., James Hutton's theory of the earth: The lost drawings (Edinburgh, 1978), together with a portfolio of twenty-seven colored facsimiles. 119. See H.H. Lowry, ed., Chemistry of coal utilization (2 vols., New York, 1945), 2, 1031, 1075. 120. Jones in Daiches et al. (ref. 115), 116.</page><page sequence="37">385 cess depended on following a few simple methodological precepts of which the most fundamental was "never to form any conclusion which is not an immediate consequence necessarily flowing from observation and experiment."121 More recently, we have had Lavoisier the indifferent experimenter, whose main contribution to chemistry was to formulate novel interpretations of the experimental discoveries of oth ers. With the superb book by Holmes on Lavoisier's chemical investi gations of life, we have a fresh approach that transcends previous scholarship on Lavoisier both in its methodological sophistication and in its coverage of the evidence.122 In the matter of evidence Holmes tells a poignant story. After he had finished writing a book based on Lavoisier's published papers and on the twelve extant volumes of Lavoisier's laboratory notebooks, Holmes decided he ought to spend a little time examining manuscript versions of the publications for possibly interesting variants. What he found were successive drafts that gave a "crucial.. .insight into Lavoisier's creative thought,"123 insight now incorporated in the book before us. As for methodology, Holmes recognizes what he calls "a general consensus" among historians of science today "that we should judge the scientists of the past, no longer by the standards of present knowledge, but in the context of their own times."124 In keeping with this view, Holmes consistently avoids modernizing 18th-century chem ical terminology. At one point, in translating a key passage from Lavoisier's "Reflections on the decomposition of water by vegetable and animal substances" (published in 1788), Holmes changes Lavoisier's terminology back to what it had been when the memoir was first written (in 1786).125 This insistence on using out-of-date language naturally slows the reader down, which may be essential to the result Holmes wants to produce. To learn that "acid of sugar"? discovered by Torbern Bergman, in 1777, as a distillation product of sugar treated with "nitrous acid"?is what we call "oxalic acid," the reader must wait almost 250 pages, until the chronological presenta 121. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, Elements of chemistry, trans. Robert Kerr (1790; re printed, New York, 1965), xviii. 122. In one important case the coverage has been exhaustive. "Lavoisier's experi ments directly involving respiration are described completely, and the development of his thought on that subject is traced in as intimate detail as surviving records permit," in F.L. Holmes, Lavoisier and the chemistry of life: An exploration of scientific creativity (Madison, 1985), 1. 123. Frederick L.

Han dling the terminology is a tricky business, however, as the case of "acid of tartar," mentioned just once by Holmes, may illustrate.126 An 18th-century chemist would have known all about the production and properties of tartar and acid of tartar, whereas Holmes' readers may not; in an effort to ensure that his readers do not know too much, Holmes may leave them knowing too little. One can, of course, look "tartar" up, and in this case an ordinary dictionary will do. FIG. 9 Lavoisier's sketch of apparatus for distillation analysis of sugar (1787). Source: Holmes (ref. 122), 338. But Holmes does not stop with the rejection of presentist, or Whig, history; he insists that "doing away with the older decisions of 'correct' and 'incorrect' does not relieve us of the need to recognize qualitatively better and worse science." He refuses to accept the view that science "is not about anything 'out there' beyond the consensus of the contemporary scientific community, that it is merely the out come of contingent social processes." His judgments on Lavoisier as a scientist are based (as they must and should be) on a complex combi nation of presentist and 18th-century considerations. Thus he writes: "the tighter control over the reasoning, the more purposeful ordering of investigations, the ability to focus on the essential and to discount the secondary.. .appear to mark [Lavoisier's] contributions as superior to most of what others were saying and doing within the same domain."127 Occasionally, Holmes permits himself to appeal explicitly to a cri terion of "correctness" as determined by later scientific results or pro cedures. He allows that Lavoisier's preferred value for the composi 126. Ibid., 110, 356. 127. Ibid., xvii, 466.</page><page sequence="39">387 tion of fixed air (72 parts oxygen to 28 carbon) "has held up extraordi narily well," referring to the experimental work of Dumas and Stas in 1840. Again, the superiority of Lavoisier's writings to "the refreshing but rambling tales of personal experimental adventures that Priestley published" is apparent to us just because "Lavoisier's approach to sci ence was so like that of our own age." Sometimes, our own standards and those of an earlier age coincide. Holmes' reference to Lavoisier's indefensible "penchant for presenting quantitative results with long strings of numbers after the decimal point" agrees with a criticism al ready formulated by William Nicholson in 1789.128 Holmes' methodological sophistication is in evidence throughout his patient and painstaking tracing of the course of Lavoisier's studies of the chemistry of life through the two decades from 1773 to 1792. Because of the richness and relevance of all the detail it would be pointless, if not indeed misleading, to summarize even portions of this treatment. It will be better to mention the provocative implications of Holmes' study for larger questions concerning Lavoisier's working methods and the development of his general chemical system. Holmes shows that from the time of Lavoisier's earliest studies of the burning of sulfur and phosphorous "the physiological process of respiration was an integral component of his investigative pro gram."129 So, one important thing that Holmes accomplishes is to re store the integral character of Lavoisier's research program. That pro gram was controlled by a powerful drive toward generality, occasional ly strong enough even to override his own experimental findings. An interesting reflection of Lavoisier's generally ambivalent attitude to ward experiments is found in a draft memoir on combustion of 1777: "As dangerous as the systematic spirit is in the physical sciences, it is just as much to be feared that in accumulating too great a multiplicity of experiments without order, one may obscure the science instead of clarifying it." And the memoir goes on to expound a "new theory of combustion" whose fundamental "law" is that "in every combustion pure air is destroyed."130 In 1786, in another draft memoir, Lavoisier extends the term "combustion" to include any combination of carbon with oxygen even in the absence of air, as in the heating of plant or an imal matter in a closed vessel over an open fire, in vinous and putrid fermentations, and in the germination of seeds.

Holmes comments that "this later develop ment has attracted less than its share of historical attention, since Lavoisier's general chemical system is regarded as having been essen tially completed by [1786]," whereas, in fact, "the special problems he encountered in plant chemistry.. .induced a significant new develop ment of his general chemical theory."131 FIG. 10 Surviving fermentation apparatus of Lavoisier.

Lavoisier was serious enough at this time about the importance of vegetation chemistry to attempt some controlled germination experi ments with cress, maize, nasturtium, and sunflower seeds. The labora tory notebook record starts on August 6, 1786, breaks off abruptly on September 13, and contains no conclusive results about the respective roles of water, air, and light in the germination process. Among Lavoisier's last actions in the Academy of Sciences just a year before it was suppressed in 1793 was his helping to establish a commission to perform experiments on vegetation and to set up a prize for the best investigation of animal digestion.132 131.

He emphasizes the impor tance of the act of writing for Lavoisier's scientific thinking: "produc ing his scientific papers was, in short, not a matter of reporting accu rately or inaccurately on something he had previously done, but an in tegral part of the creative process." He notes Lavoisier's flexible or tolerant?hostile critics might say, cavalier?attitude toward experi mental results; if "in his operations and equipment, he displayed a meticulous care, unsurpassed in his age," he also "frequently used the results of experiments he knew to be flawed."133 Also, Lavoisier was a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences for almost his entire scientific career, with mixed effects on his scientific creativity: the "near professionalism" of the Academy was highly stimulating but the absence of adequate financial reward necessitated a dependence on other sources of income and left Lavoisier with only one full day a week for research.134 A different interpretation of Lavoisier's financial situation is possible; after all, he inherited a substantial fortune from his mother and he married into wealth.135 Furthermore, it was social connections with mathematically-minded Academicians (in particular, Gaspard Monge and Laplace) that encouraged Lavoisier to push as far as he could (some critics might say, too far) the analogy between alge braic equations and chemical balance sheets. Holmes says little about another likely factor in Lavoisier's scientific creativity, his education. The influence of the geologist Guettard and the chemist Rouelle is well-known; it is more difficult to know what he learned earlier while attending the College Mazarin from 1754 to 1761. Unfortunately, not much is known about the teaching of Lavoisier's professors; even the new prosopographical stu dies of the professoriate of the Ancien Regime turned up very little.136 Complementary to Holmes' focus on Lavoisier's work in the la boratory is Gillispie's account of Lavoisier's administrative work for the French government. Gillispie's book is packed with rich and relevant detail concerning a great variety of Old Regime institutions, and he also manages to include trenchant, often entertaining, bio graphical sketches of many of the leading figures in his story.137 No 133.

Lavoisier was connect ed to the government through the Tax Farm (in which he invested heavily and profitably) and the Gunpowder Farm (which he directed from the time of its reorganization by Turgot in 1775). Gillispie's ac count of the French gunpowder industry is a masterpiece of compres sion, and also amusing. As Gillispie explains, saltpetre was collected in Paris by members of "a guild of gothic harpies" from "cellars and courts, damp passages and privies, debris and demolitions" and in the country from "compost and manure heaps and.. .the humid under reaches of farm buildings." He does not hesitate to reveal to us?what was not yet known in Lavoisier's time?the composition of saltpetre (at least, when it is formed on limestone), namely, calcium nitrate.138 If Lavoisier was the cynosure of the Academy, and therefore of the French scientific community, in the decade before the French Revolu tion, Jean-Paul Marat (1743-1793), Lavoisier's exact contemporary, was, in Gillispie's words, "already in 1780.. .perceived as a pest, one among many, if not a menace, by members of the Academy of Sci ence." Complaining that previous students of Marat's work have not read Marat's writings, Gillispie sets out to "try to recover how Marat must have appeared in his own eyes and in the eyes of others up to the end of the year 1788, when he published the last of his scientific books." Gillispie succeeds admirably in this feat of historical recovery. After practicing and writing about medicine, Marat turned to physics, and eventually published works on fire, electricity, and light, as well as a French translation of Newton's Opticks (1787), which Gillispie pro nounces "excellent."139 Marat began his physics books with a sweep ing rejection of virtually all recent and contemporary research; his theory of fire, for example, retained a conception of phlogiston and therefore opposed up-to-date chemistry. Marat came to hate the Academy, which rejected his work, and especially Lavoisier. In Sep tember 1791 Marat vilified the members of the Academy in a speech entitled "The modern charlatans," but he did not live quite long enough to see the Academy finally suppressed in August 1793. Marat's theories about light hold some interest. They derived from the observations he made through his solar microscope of the well known fringe phenomena, all of which he tries to explain in terms of Newtonian "inflexion." Marat went so far as to explain the dispersion 138. Ibid., 51-54. According to Lavoisier, saltpetre is a combination of nitric acid "with lime and magnesia, sometimes with potash, and rarely with argill [clay, or alumi nosilicate]." Lavoisier (ref. 121), 214. 139.

He also insisted on taking red, blue, and green as primary colors rather than (as he supposed) Newton's seven hues. But this, of course, is a total misunderstanding of Newton's concep tion of primary colors?of which there are an indefinitely large number?and I am surprised that Gillispie thinks otherwise.141 As for achromatic lenses, Marat was certainly right that Newton discounted their possibility on the mistaken ground that dispersion is indepen 140. Ibid., 324, n. 222 seems to take seriously this alleged non-parallelism, not, to be sure, on Marat's grounds but because the rays come from different points on the solar disc. But Newton deals with this problem quite carefully showing both by calculation and experiment that the finite diameter of the solar disc can be ignored. The full theoretical calculation can be found in his Lectiones Opticae. 141. Gillispie (ref. 7), 307-308. Gillispie relies on recent critiques of Newton's op tics, whose cogency I question.</page><page sequence="44">392 dent of refractive index, but this in no way mars the coherence of Newton's theory of light and colors. Marat's critique falls into a tradition of misunderstanding pre valent among Continental optical writers (including even the great Huygens) from Newton's initial publication in 1672 to and beyond Goethe's Farbenlehre of 1810.142 Most of the critiques either miscon ceive Newton's theory or rely on mistaken experiments, or both; Marat seems no exception. What then should be made of Gillispie's claim that Marat's experiments are "impossible to distinguish in prin ciple from others by means of which persons then and now recognized to be scientists have explored the world"? The fatal flaw in Marat's hundreds of repetitions of Newton's elongated solar spectrum experi ment, "each requiring a distinct manipulation of lens, prism, screen, and light beam," is perhaps that, unlike Newton's experiments, they were designed neither to refute clearly formulated hypotheses nor to generate inductive generalizations.143 7. LAVOISIER: SMELLS, PHLOGISTON, DISCOURSE There are many ways in which any historical figure can be contex tualized; one of the oddest is the recent insertion of Lavoisier into an osphresiological context. Osphresiology is the science of smells. La voisier did not contribute directly to the development of such a sci ence, which was adumbrated in attempts to classify smells by Lin naeus, Haller, and others, and reached some sort of culmination with Hyppolite Cloquet's immense compilation, Osphresiologie ou traite des odeurs (1821). But the development of a science of odors may well have presupposed Lavoisier's theory of gases, which was explicitly ap plied to odors by two of his associates, Fourcroy and Berthollet.144 No longer were odors to be thought of as mysterious subtle fluids but rather as corpuscles dissolved in gases or liquids. Furthermore, ac cording to Alain Corbin, a revolution in the perception of odor oc curred concomitantly with, and was perhaps facilitated by, the development of a science of "airs." 142. Goethe approved of some of Marat's optical investigations (Gillispie, ibid., 325, n. 224). For recent sympathetic discussions of Goethe's critique of Newton, see Freder ick Amrine, Francis J. Zucker, and Harvey Wheeler, eds., Goethe and the sciences: A reappraisal (Dordrecht, 1987). 143. Ibid., 312, 324.

Alain Corbin, The foul and the fragrant: Odor and the French social imagination (Cambridge, MA, 1986), 112.</page><page sequence="45">393 The principal feature of this revolution was a "lowering of the threshold of olfactory tolerance."145 Corbin cites numerous contem porary observers who attest to this newly heightened sensitivity to smells, both "unpleasant" (e.g., stinks from cesspools, slaughterhouses, and tallow-melting houses) and "pleasant" (e.g., strong perfumes such as musk, civet, and ambergris). Though his evidence is mostly literary and impressionistic, Corbin can cite several "scientific" studies of the odor of decomposition or putrefaction (Thiroux d'Arconville, 1766; Guillaume-Lambert Godart, 1763; Fulgence Raymond, before 1769). Furthermore, Corbin finds as a forerunner of the olfactory revolution a revolutionary linguistic change in the 17th century, which purged the French language "of the more malodorous features of its vocabu lary."146 Toward the end of the 18th century in France (and even earlier in England) the proper ventilation of crowded places, such as prisons, barracks, hospitals, and ships, became a matter of concern. "Deodori zation was both outcome and proof of this control of currents [of air]," and "Lavoisier's chemistry made it possible to define precise norms of ventilation."147 (The antithesis of these crowded places, by the way, was the mountain, where one was known to breathe free ly).148 All this throws a fresh light on Lavoisier's interest in the disin fection of cesspools, the ventilation of prisons, and the minimum size of hospital rooms.149 Lavoisier made at least one furtive foray into a crowded theater to sample the air, and recorded the event in a paper for the Society of Medicine. Here is part of Holmes' summary of the unpublished manuscript:150 [Lavoisier] chose the palace of the Tuileries, where the Comedie Franchise was then playing to a full house. Carrying a pneumatic flask filled with water up into the balcony, he collected one sample of air from a vacant box. To collect his lower sample he descended into the orchestra pit with another pneumatic jar. He was so afraid that he would attract attention and disrupt the performance, however, that he slipped in hurriedly a few minutes before it ended, hastily collected the air, and departed. When he afterward examined this air and found "no sensible difference from outdoor air," he decided that the reason was that he had obtained it too close to the entrance. 145. Ibid., 59-61. 146.

Holmes (ref. 122), 239-240.</page><page sequence="46">394 The olfactory revolution had its political side. This became clear during the 19th century, with what Corbin calls "the bourgeois control of the sense of smell."151 Corbin has hit on a fascinating and certainly neglected subject. His method for handling it, however, is hardly ade quate, amounting to little more than the accumulation of striking pas sages from a great variety of texts differing widely in genre and in date, accompanied by enunciation of resounding taxonomic principles that are more portentous than illuminating. I turn to two other guises in which Lavoisier appears in recent books. Karl Hufbauer offers the first study of the emergence of a pro fessional community of chemists in Germany during the 1780s. He measures the degree of social solidarity of that community by how its members responded to the challenge of Lavoisier's new chemistry in the 1790s. Wilda Anderson's central theme concerns Lavoisier's new philosophy of language, which is taken to determine a new epistemolo gy, which in turn determines both a new definition of the field of chemistry and a new method. In keeping with this theme, Anderson presents a literary analysis of chemical texts, particularly Pierre Joseph Macquer's Dictionary of chemistry and Lavoisier's Elements of chemis try. Whereas Hufbauer uses the prosopographic methods of social his tory and citation analysis from the sociology of science, Anderson sees herself as applying perhaps for the first time to scientific texts Michel Foucault's notion of "discourse."152 The books are short (each 151 pages), but each has useful appen dices. Hufbauer's presents biographical profiles of 65 German chem ists, institutional histories of 64 German universities and schools, and a study of the subscribers to Crell's Chemische Annalen for the years 1784-1791. Anderson's reproduces three tables of elements and com pounds from Guyton de Morveau and Lavoisier and translate into En glish the 213 passages quoted in French in the text. Hufbauer's book is clearly written, persuasively argued, and a significant contribution to the cultural-institutional history of science; Anderson's book is too obscurely written for me to be able to guess what it might be good for. The first German journal devoted exclusively to chemistry (Crell's Chemische Annalen) began publishing in 1778. Choosing the year 1789, Hufbauer locates 134 contributors living in Germany. By counting how often they refer to one another, he finds that a hundred contributors were peripheral, 19 between the periphery and the core, and 15 at the core. Three of the last group were known mainly for editing and translating, and the remaining 12 "for their efforts to ap 151. Corbin (ref. 144), 141. 152.

Eight of them "constituted an interactive collectivity." Their initial attitude toward the new chemis try may have been caught in a letter from Paris, which Crell printed in his journal in 1789, immediately after the publication of Lavoisier's Elements of chemistry.152, I have witnessed a most remarkable drama here, one which to me as a German was very unexpected, and quite shocking. I saw the famous M. Lavoisier hold a ceremonial auto-da-fe of phlogiston in the Arsenal. His wife.. .served as the sacrificial priestess, and Stahl appeared as the advo catus diaboli to defend phlogiston. In the end, poor phlogiston was burned on the accusation of oxygen. Gradually Lavoisier's antiphlogistic chemistry picked up adherents in Germany. The first two, in 1789, were H.F. Link, a medical stu dent, and Hermbstaedt, a member of the core; by 1792, there were ten more, none of them a chemist, except Klaproth, the most dis tinguished analytical chemist in Germany. Hufbauer explains this pattern by arguing that there was more pressure on core members (as opposed to peripheral or non-members) of the German chemical com munity to hold on to the traditional, German, phlogiston theory. Confirmation of this explanation comes from the relatively large number (nine by 1790) of conversions to antiphlogistonism in Vienna, Prague, and Schemnitz: Hapsburg Germany was geographically, ethni cally, and religiously far from the core of the German chemical com munity. As for Hermbstaedt, Hufbauer explains: "he was an ambi tious man who, though he had publicly renounced his pharmaceutical career in 1786, had not yet managed to obtain an academic position;" "he could easily have sensed that adoption and espousal of a theory with so many strengths and such good prospects might redound to his advantage."154 It was he who converted Klaproth (whose reputation was never in jeopardy). The other core members of the German chemical community demanded experimental proof. The crucial evidence came from mer cury calx per se (prepared by heating mercury in the atmosphere) and red precipitate of mercury (prepared by heating the product obtained from dissolving mercury in nitric acid). Lavoisier asserted that these two mercury compounds were identical because both yielded equivalent amounts of the same gas (vital air, or oxygen) when heated, and that the calx (supposedly mercury minus phlogiston) could be changed back to mercury by heating without any source of phlogiston (such as charcoal). In 1790/1, Trommsdorff and Westrumb challenged 153. Hufbauer (ref. 6), 90-91, 96. 154. Ibid., 114-115.</page><page sequence="48">396 the accuracy of Lavoisier's experiments when they claimed to have heated red calx of mercury and obtained not oxygen but water vapor. There followed a prolonged and passionate debate. Hermbstaendt and Klaproth demonstrated Lavoisier's result and before a dozen witnesses; the date was April 3, 1793, which Hermbstaendt hoped would be "the second death day of phlogiston."155 A young Belgian chemist named van M?ns found the reason for the failure of Wes trumb and TrommsdorfFs reduction experiments: by prolonged heat ing of the calx (in order to dehydrate it), they had changed it into a blackish-red oxide of mercury that produces no oxygen on further heating.156 Westrumb and TrommsdorfT capitulated. Of the eight leading German chemists, only Crell, Gmelin, and Wiegleb were left to lead a futile opposition. A new periodical, the Allgemeiner Journal der Chemie, which reflected the new orthodoxy within the German chemical community, came into existence in 1798 and rapidly sup planted Crell's journal. Hufbauer believes that his study shows that the increasingly cons cious self-identity of the German chemical community was not based on "a common paradigm for investigating and interpreting chemical phenomena" but rather on an "ideology" featuring "confidence in chemistry's usefulness and profundity, enthusiasm for chemical experi mentation, pride in their identity as German chemists." "Social soli darity," however, did not emerge until Crell's journal made available a reliable means by which German chemists could communicate with one another. The antiphlogiston episode demonstrates that social soli darity can have cognitive consequences by "conditioning, perhaps in some instances dictating" the attachment of German chemists to one side or the other in the controvery.157 Hufbauer's analysis of the German chemical community may be compared profitably with Gillispie's criteria for the existence of a pro fession: "mastery of a body of knowledge;" "legitimately followed for gain;" and "self-governing in that it exercises jurisdiction over the education, qualifications, and conduct of its members."158 By his cri teria, Gillispie says, divinity, law, and medicine, but not science, which met only the first criterion, were professions in the 18th centu ry. (Hufbauer seems to agree with Gillispie since he asserts that pro 155. Ibid., 134-135. Trommsdorff was one of those about whom Hufbauer says that "the pressure to conform was such that most of the community's ambitious young re cruits remained phlogistonists throughout the first phase of the German antiphlogistic revolution" (105). 156. Ibid., 137. 157. Ibid., 5. 158. Gillispie (ref. 7), 84-85.</page><page sequence="49">397 fessionalization of German chemistry first occurred in the 19th centu ry, when German universities were transformed into research centers.)159 Gillispie's three criteria are "mixed," one cognitive and two social. He holds that the two types are not independent of each other, for sometimes the content of a science determines its organiza tion and its relation to government; for example, the French govern ment became less disposed to interfere in the operations of the Academy as the content of the sciences became more rigorous and technical. Thus, reversing Hufbauer's sequence, cognitive criteria now have social consequences. The trouble is that this makes the profes sionalization of science appear almost inevitable?which could discourage detailed study of individual case histories. Hufbauer's book is especially welcome because historians of chem istry have concentrated on the British and French chemical communi ties. This historiographical emphasis is partly explained by sheer numbers. As Crosland puts it: "In the period 1760-95 French chemi cal authors outnumbered their British counterparts by more than 3 to 1; Scandinavian and German contributors followed some way behind."160 The Scandinavian chemists now deserve more attention outside Sweden. This is the burden of a short note by Marco Beretta, whose particular concern is Torbern Bergman (1735-1784). Beretta mentions the rich scholarly resource represented by the 29 volumes of Bergman manuscripts in the library of the University of Uppsala. Despite Bergman's lifelong loyalty to phlogiston, "he was very close to Lavoisier's chemistry, of which he rejected the results but surely not the methods." Beretta traces the divergence in results to the influence of divergent philosophical traditions: Bergman drew on Newton, Keill, and Euler, while Lavoisier?probably?on Condillac.161 Condillac returns us to Anderson, who says that she uses his philosophy?in particular, his concept of analysis?-to contrast Mac quer and Lavoisier. Uninterested in anything so mundane as intellec tual influence, Anderson can brush off the fact that Condillac's funda mental work, his Logique (1785), was not published until after the second edition of Macquer's Dictionnaire de chymie (1778). "Since I am talking here about analysis as a commonplace of Enlightenment thought, or rather, as one of the major organizing principles of the 159. Hufbauer (ref. 6), 2-3. 160. Maurice Crosland, "Chemistry and the chemical revolution," in Rousseau and Porter (ref. 11), 389-416, on 411. 161.

Melhado, Jacob Berzelius: The emergence of his chemi cal system (Madison, 1981).</page><page sequence="50">398 classical episteme, there is perhaps no reason to privilege chronological priority over clarity in choosing the basic model."162 Anderson's claims seem to go something like this. Macquer's basic metaphor for both the history of chemistry and the system of chemis try is spatial (as in a map), and this emphasis is reflected in his pre ferred literary genre, the dictionary; whereas Lavoisier's basic meta phor for the system of chemistry is temporal (as in the operation of a grammatical rule), and this emphasis on temporality is reflected in his preferred literary genre, the (linear) treatise.163 "Temporal" is my term; Anderson never opposes in so many words "temporal" and "spatial" discourse, though she does oppose spatiality to "progress along a line." (With a little ingenuity one could no doubt relate Lavoisier's refusal to invoke the history of chemistry to his very em phasis on temporality.)164 Both Macquer and Lavoisier claim to be pursuing an analytical method that Anderson finds formulated in Condillac; or rather, two versions of this method may be found in Condillac's Logic. On the one hand, Condillac explains how a visually perceived landscape can only be described in language by first examining the landscape, part by part, in an orderly fashion and then reassembling the successively per ceived parts into a simultaneous whole.165 On the other hand, Condil lac, in a passage quoted by Lavoisier, virtually identifies language and algebra, and concludes that "The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged.'"166 Anderson seems to take the spatial metaphor as dominant in Condillac's thought because she asks us "to follow Lavoisier through his seemingly conventional evocation of Con dillac, in order to see how each all-too-familiar term in the analytic vocabulary takes on a different meaning when read in the context of this shift of priorities"167 ?a shift which must now be explained. The organization of a dictionary of chemistry is entirely arbitrary. Those who consult such a work are, therefore, free to organize the field in alternative ways; Macquer says as much.168 Macquer could not 162. Anderson (ref. 152), 23, n. 4. 163. Ibid., 20, 125. 164.

To help the reader, Macquer provided a detailed table of contents and recommended reading certain articles in a preferred order. In Anderson's terms, the table of contents betrayed Macquer's spatial format. The recommend ed plan of reading might seem to be temporally organized, but Ander son finds a way to make it appropriate for Macquer:169 The reader is instructed several times to reread groups of articles that he has already read, or to refer to several other articles at a time for com parison. The map of the reader's trajectory would not be a straight line, as it would be when reading a treatise, but a wandering, backtracking, and sometimes multiple or splintered path, as would be the path of Diderot's reader of the Encyclopedie. Anderson's allusion to Diderot's Encyclopedie is not casual, for she sees it to have "the same underlying epistemology" as Macquer's Dic tionary. The underlying epistemology is, of course, Condillac's "language-dominated theory of analytic perception and knowledge." This theory gave rise to a subversive social philosophy, whose adherents were generated by the system of cross-references, which brings together previously unconnected ideas in the mind of the reader. The opposite of such an alphabetized literary work is the linear treatise with its "repressive nomenclature," whose "primary function.. .is to keep [the] scientist in line, in both senses of the term." Here the reader does not exercise mastery over the subject matter, the reverse occurs: "both the knowledge and those who use it or who are privileged by it are in a position of mastery with respect to the reader."170 It is this transition from texts like Macquer's and Diderot's to texts like Lavoisier's that Anderson identifies as the critical shift from na tural philosophy to modern science: "The real difference.. .grows out of this shift of emphasis away from seeing science as an individual operation performed on a language to one in which language sets the parameters for the writers." Science henceforth speaks with a "collec tive voice." "The impersonal language of positivist science directs the ongoing research."171 Here we arrrive at a paradox because the indivi dual scientist, no longer, even in his own eyes, the "author" of his theory (who is, rather, nature herself), nevertheless continues to be "responsible for.. .the work he produces inside that theory."172 169.

Ibid., 151.</page><page sequence="52">400 To illustrate how Lavoisier's chemical theories reflect his methodo logical assumptions, Anderson describes his doctrine of elements. Here she makes much of the distinction Lavoisier draws in his Tratte between "simple substances" and "elements." Lavoisier classifies light, caloric, oxygen, azote (nitrogen), and hydrogen as "simple substances belonging to all the kingdoms of nature, which may be considered as the elements of bodies." The remaining simple substances fall into three groups: "Oxydable and acidifiable simple substances not metal lic," "oxydable and acidifiable simple metallic bodies," and "salifiable simple earthy substances." Lavoisier thereby singles out as elements a certain group of simple substances (which he defines, in general, as "simple in the present state of our knowledge, and so far as chemical analysis has hitherto been able to show"), which are very widely distri buted throughout nature.173 Anderson, however, finds "metaphysics" in the distinction, citing a passage in which (as she sees it) Lavoisier uses that term to distinguish more and less provisional meanings for elements. But this passage (from the preface to the Traite) constitutes a forthright rejection by Lavoisier of any metaphysical meaning for elements. (A crucial terminological point: in his Preface Lavoisier does not yet use the term "element" with the special connotations of his later table of simple substances.) Anderson ends with the odd view that the elements are "an indication of Lavoisier's backwardness, of his tendency to revert to the old chemistry of the four elements."174 For support for this interpretation she turns to a powerful but un likely source: Henry Guerlac. Guerlac once quoted the following note, which Lavoisier wrote in 1792: It is not enough for a substance to be simple, indivisible, or at least un decomposed for us to call it an element. It is also necessary for it to be abundantly distributed in nature and to enter as an essential and consti tuent principle in the composition of a great number of bodies. What is critical for Guerlac in this passage is the phrase, "to enter as an essential and constituent principle." He takes it to refer to the trad itional "chemistry of principles," where "elements.. .were thought of as the bearers and the causes of the distinctive qualities of bodies into which they enter." Guerlac explains how Lavoisier might have thought of each of his five elements as the "principle" of a certain kind of bo dies; caloric accounting for physical state, oxygen for acidity, hydrogen for water, light for vegetation, and azote for alkalis.175 I find it more 173.

Perrin, "Lavoisier's table of the elements: A reappraisal," Ambix, 20 (1973), 95-105, and rejected by Robert Siegfried, "Lavoisier's table of simple substances: Its origin and interpretation," Ambix, 29(1982), 29-48.</page><page sequence="53">401 plausible to take Lavoisier at his word in the "Table of simple sub stances," which treats elements as unusual owing to their widespread presence in all three kingdoms of nature. Anderson's claim that Lavoisier's classification of the simple sub stances into two groups "serves the rhetorical function of disguising the fact that the two groups should have been divided between light and caloric on one side and all of the rest as simple substances on the other side,"176 seems far-fetched to me. No doubt caloric and light possess peculiar properties; Lavoisier acknowledged the fact when he introduced caloric as a "hypothetical fluid" in the first chapter of his Traite. Like many of Anderson's other claims, I find this one not demonstrably false but uninteresting. Other readers of her book have had reactions quite different from mine.177 Robert Palter Trinity College Hartford, CT 06106 176. Anderson (ref. 152), 145. 177.
