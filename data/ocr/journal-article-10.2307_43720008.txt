<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW LATIN PSALTER: AN EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY1 IV- PSALMS 7; 8 Ernest Lussier Ps. 7 Appeal of One Calumniated to the Judge of Ail The title states that the poem is a lamentation of David which he sang to God because of the words of Cush the Benjaminite. Cush is not other- wise known to us but he must have been a partisan of the Benjaminite Saul who calumniated David before the king (cf. I Sam. 24:10). David prays for aid against his calumniators (w. 2, 3), solemnly pro- testing his innocence of the crimes laid to his charge (4-6). He appeals to the judgment of God, the judge of the nations (7-10) professing his com- plete trust in God, the just judge (11-14). He finally described the punishment of the wicked and his own salvation (15-18). V. 2. The Psalm begins with a pious captatio benevolentiae , a delicate expression of trust in God. David will be torn to pieces, like a lion's prey, unless God saves him (v. 3). In verses 4 to 6 the Psalmist's appeal for help ils supported by a solemn protestation of innocence. He imprecates death upon himself if he has done the wrong charged against him. V. 5. His conduct has been the very opposite of what is attributed to him. Far from being guilty of unprovoked outrages he has saved the life of his enemies, even though their hostility was causeless. This must be a ref- erence to the occasions in the cave and in the camp when he prevented his followers from killing Saul (I Sam. 24:11; 26:9). V. 6. Söul, life, honor are parallel and synonymous. The soul is desig- nated as "honor," being the noblest part of man, the seat of his honor and dignity, and the image of the divine glory (cf. Gen. 1:26). There is a climax in the three clauses. If I am guilty let my enemies take my life with every circumstance not only of violence but also of disgrace. Vv. 7-10. Conscious of his integrity, David now appeals to the judgment of God, the judge of the world, for the vindication of his innocence. V. 7. God's condemnation of sin and evil, His holiness and justice are well described as anger or fury. The thought is highly anthropomorphic, couched in very human language. God is urged to stand up as though He 1 Cf.

Ps. 120:3-4). V. 8. The psalmist prays that God, summoning round His tribunal all the nations, would hold a great assize and vindicate his innocence (v. 9). He makes no claim of being perfect but protests that he is innocent of the crimes with which he has been charged. V. 10. In the Bible the heart usually symbolizes mind and character, thought and will; the reins (kidneys) figure the affections and emotions. By proving men's hearts and reins God knows their inmost thoughts and affections.2 Vv. 11-14. David now professes his complete trust in the judicial right- eousness of God. He has been crying for justice, asking God to set up His tribunal and mete out judgment; but he knows well that God's judicial wrath agains evil never rests, and that the punishment of the wicked willl surely come. Unless they are converted, God, like a mighty warrior, will arm Himself with sword and bow and execute justice upon them (v. 13). He will whet His sword and prepare for them deadly darts. The reference in verse 14 is apparently to the fire-darts of ancient warfare. Inflammable materials like tow and pitch were attached to arrows which were then lighted and shot into a besieged city setting it on fire. Vv. 15-18. This last strophe describes the punishment of the wicked as the natural result of their own evil actions. They will fall into the snares which they had laid for others, whereas the righteous psalmist will be saved. V. 15. The sinner is compared to a woman in childbirth. The child conceived is all manner of evil: iniquity, malice, delusion ( dolum ), ultimate disappointment for its author. Verse 16 contains another picture of the destruction of the wicked. The sinner, like a hunter, digs with care a deep pit to destroy the just, but he is buried in his own trench and caught in his own trap. V. 17. A third figure sets forth the same truth. Evil certainly recoils on the evil-doer, like a stone which falls back on him who threw it up (cf. Ecclus. 27:35). V. 18. The Psalm closes on a joyous note; it is the calm after the storm. David returns to the strain of the beginning of the Psalm, but instead of the confidence with which he had entrusted his cause to God, we find an out- burst of praise for God who, the psalmist is sure, has answered his prayer. David promises to make his life a hymn of praise of God's righteousness which will be manifested in the punishment of the wicked. God will show that He is the most high, the supreme master of the whole world. 1 Paul Dhorme, L' Emploi métaphorique des noms de parties du corps en hébreu et en akkadien, (Paris: Gabalda, 1923), pp. 109-133.</page><page sequence="3">The New Latin Psalter 83 Liturgical Use Psalm 7 is recited at Compline on Monday. It presents God as judge and should be a good reminder to examine our onscience; it is thus well suited for recitation at night prayers. At the office for the dead verse 3 is the antiphon. The deceased person begs God to be freed from Satan's power. Ps. 8 Th Majesty of God and the Dignity of Man* The title states that the Psalm is from the choirmaster's collection and that it is a mizmor (psalmus) of David, meaning that it was destined to be sung to a musical accompaniment. The title specifies further that the poem was originally set to a melody entitled "Wine-presses." No serious objection can be made against the Davidic authorship of this Psalm although there is nothing in the text to suggest when David actually wrote it. The psalmist compares the majesty of God with the littleness of man (w. 2-5). Man, however, has been made to God's image and appointed His viceregent over creation (6, 7), in all its varied forms of life (8, 9). Verse 10 repeats verse 2 as a refrain. Verse 2 has the fundamental thought, the theme of the Psalm: admiration and praise of God the Creator of our wonderful universe and the signal benefactor of man who by nature is so insignificant. V. 2. God's name is glorious over all the earth; creation is a magnificent manifestation of God's character and of His attributes. His majesty reaches above the heavens; it is self-sufficient ( extulisti ) and greater than we can suspect. V. 3. The verse is a bit awkward but it attaches beuatifully the unre- flecting witness of the very young to the testimony of the heavens. The innocent prattling of children is praise which from God's viewpoint out- weighs the plots of His enemies. The babes' incoherent babbling actually gives God glory, is worth something in His sight, whereas His enemies' opposition is powerless against Him. God created the innocent mumbling of children to silence the malicious plots of men. On Palm Sunday Our Lord quoted this verse very aptly to confound the priests and the scribes who were moved with indignation when they heard the Hosannas of the boys in the temple (Mt. 21 :15, 16). • Cf.

As he looks up to the heavens and views all their splendor, the psalmist is forced to wonder that God has chosen so insignificant a being as man for the object of His special regard, His constant, loving, providential care. David is thinking of the sky at night for he does not mention the sun whose praise is so well sung in Psalm 18. The star-lit sky, especially in the transparent clearness of the Eastern atmosphere, suggests naturally to a thinking mind the vastness, variety, and mystery of the universe, a vague reflection of the beauty, immensity, and majesty of the Creator. The creative operation of God is compared to the deft workmanship of a skilful artist. "Thy fingers' art" is Milton's5 translation of "opus digitorum tuorum ." God set the moon and the stars in their places (Jundasti) after he had created them (cf. Gen. 1:17). The sky is imagined popularly as a solid vault on which the moon and stars have been fixed in their places. The ellipse between verses 4 and 5 may be filled in as follows: "As I look up to your heavens . . . the thought is forced upon me: what is man, etc." V. 5. The expression "son of man" is only a poetic variation for man. Notice how modern astronomical discovery has only deepened and in- tensified the meaning of the poet's observation. The thought of this verse is repeated in Ps. 143 :3. It is bitterly parodied by Job (7 :17, 18) who wonders that God should think it worth while to make man the object of His unceasing persecution. Vv. 6-9. Notwithstanding his littleness, man has been elevated to a very high dignity. V. 6. The later Greek versions (Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotian) and Saint Jerome translate the text, "You have made him little less than Elohim ," i.e. yourself. If that were the meaning we should rather expect ' 'little less than yourself In all cases, the LXX, the Vulgate, the Targum, and the Peshitta have all understood Elohim as referring not to God but to the angels, and they are more probably right (cf. Heb. 2:7). The word Elohim in Scripture applies not only to God but also to false gods (Ps. 85:8) and to every being constituted in dignity, judges, kings (Ps. 81:1,. 6) or angels (Ps. 137:1), which apparently are meant here. However, many modern critics think, with Saint Jerome, that Elohim here really means God, but all commentators are agreed that the text alludes to the creation of man as told in Gen. 1 :26-28. 4 Cf.

Here, as in Genesis, man's dignity, his spiritual nature, which makes of him a more perfect representation of God's infinite perfections than all the other creatures here below, this elevated rank, the honor and glory with which God has crowned him, gives him sovereignty over the rest of creation (v. 7). This sovereignty is not so much mere physical power and domintaion, although man has that also to a great extent, but rather a greatness inherent to his nature which surpasses by far the rest of God's material creation. Bossuet's® commentary on this verse is noteworthy. God made man a little less than the angels. Less, for man's spirit is united to a body, and so is inferior to the angels who are pure spirits. But only a little less, for like the angels man has life, intelligence, and love; and man is happy only in the participation of the happiness of the angels, in God who is the common beatitude of both man and angel. Saint Paul accommodates verses 5 to 7 in his Epistle to the Hebrews (2 :6ff ) making use of the words more than of the sense. By His Incarnation and especially His death Christ was made less than the angels, but by his Resurrection and his Ascension he was crowned with honor and glory. In 1 Cor. 15-26 (cp. Eph. 1 :22) we find another accommodation, this time of verse 7b, to express the subjection of all things to Christ. Vv. 7-9. These verses pass in review man's subjects; the domestic animals and the wild animals, the birds of the air, the fish in the sea and all the inhabitants of the. mysterious depths of the ocean have been sub- jected to his sway. The creatures enumerated represent all creation ( omnia v. 7). Milton7 translates: O'er the works of thy hands thou mad'st him lord, Thou hast put all under his lordly feet, All flocks, and herds, by thy commanding word, All beasts that in the field or forest meet, Fowl of the Heavens, and fish that through the wet Seapaths in shoals do slide, and know no dearth. Verse 10 repeats the great theme of the psalm. It strikes again the note of reverent wonder and thanksgiving found at the beginning. But the leitmotiv is sounded, we may say, an octave higher and graced with all the richness of a perfect chord after the intervening melody. Speaking without •Cf.

Liturgical Use This beautiful Psalm is frequently used in the divine office: Trinity, Holy Name (v. 2a),8 Finding of the Holy Cross, Transfiguration (vv. 6, 7), Ascension (v. 2b), Immaculate Conception, Holy Angels, All Saints (vv. 2a, 6b, 7), One Martyr (v. 6b), Confessors (vv. 2a, 6b, 7), Virgins and Holy Women. All these applications are so natural that any explanation seems superfluous. 8 The verses indicated are used as antiphons in the Breviary and give the key-note of the liturgical application.</page></plain_text>
