<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Educational Research Fall 1977, Vol. 47, No. 4, Pp. 651-693 Constructivist Approaches in Educational Research A. Jon Magoon University of Delaware This review briefly examines what will be called a "construc- tivist" theme in the history and philosophy of the social and behavioral sciences, outlines a rationale for such studies in education today, and evaluates some applications. It is probable that such views will rapidly gain credibility in the decade ahead for educational researchers, much as cognitive views gained acceptance in the parent disciplines of psychology and sociology within the last two decades. The development of the fields of cognitive psychology and sociology is not clearly understood by most educational researchers, but represents the adoption of somewhat nontraditional values regarding what the important phenomena are in the social and behavioral sciences. These values need to be briefly described and examined at the outset, but will also be reconsidered in more detail from time to time in the discussion. The constructivist perspective holds as a chief assumption about much complex behavior that the "subjects" being studied I am indebted to the following colleagues for their insight into many of these matters and their careful commentaries or suggestions on drafts of this work: Theodore Feely, Rita Fillos, Sandra Harding, Betty Haslett, Charles Marler, Ludwig Mosberg, Frank Murray, Ann Pace, and Jay Price. 651</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH must at a minimum be considered knowing beings, and that this knowledge they possess has important consequences for how behavior or actions are interpreted. This is, of course, the life- blood of the cognitive proposal, for cognition is literally defined as "knowledge or the capacity for it . . ." (Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1958). This knowledge is further assumed to have a complex set of referents and meanings that also must be taken into account when the scientist is studying human actions or behavior. A second assumption, independent of the first, is that the locus of control over much so-called intelligent behavior resides initially within the subjects themselves, although this capacity for autonomous action is often severely constrained, for example, by either explicit or tacit recognition of social norms. The important implication here is that much behavior must be understood as purposive; i.e., aimed toward some end. In other words, much important complex behavior like teaching and learning might be best understood as being constructed purpos- ively by the subjects (both teachers and pupils) themselves, and cannot adequately be studied without accounting for meaning and purposes. A third important assumption is that Darwinian evolution has left the human species (and others close to it philogenetically) with a highly developed capacity for (a) develop- ing knowledge by organizing complexity rapidly; (b) attending to the meanings of complex communications rather than the sur- face elements; and (c) having individuals take on complex social roles and reconstruct elaborate social roles. The prime phenomena for the educational researcher may well be at their most basic level unavoidably sophisticated and highly organized. Given that these phenomena are thought to be most central by those of a constructivist persuasion, then it is not surprising that a social anthropological methodology, which seeks to explicate the relationships among such phenomena as well as other fac- tors, has such appeal. A constructivist approach, in brief, amounts to a refocusing of educational research on another part of the schooling phenomena and consequently taking an ap- proach to it that is called ethnographic; that is, an extensive descriptive and interpretive effort at explaining the complexity. There is supposed to be an important traditional concern for similar constructions of minds, but it is, in fact, a standard more honored in the breech than in practice (Messick, 1975). Educators are familiar with the notion of a psychological construct (APA, p. 29, 1974): ".... an idea developed or 'constructed' as a work of informed, scientific imagination; that is, it is a theoretical idea developed to explain and to organize some aspects of existing knowledge." The process of construct validation aims at the determination of the meaning of a measure, and this review will focus on analogous meanings to participants. Just as individual 652 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="3">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH scientists and scientific communities develop constructs, con- structivists point out that individuals in their societies do pre- cisely the same thing; i.e., invent, organize, and act via rules; and that social and behavioral scientists can and should study both this process as well as the end-product. Specific proposals for precisely this kind of scientific focus have come from Geertz (1973) in anthropology, Heider (1958) in psychology, and Schutz (1970) in sociology. Many recent educational ethnographies ap- pear to implicitly attend to similar assumptions and appear to reject many traditional norms that educational researchers have held, which raises the question of whether this constructivist approach cannot be described as a "competing paradigm" in the sense that the historian of the physical sciences Kuhn (1962) described alternative and incompatible perspectives regarding the same phenomena. Kuhn's account of scientific progress and change from one approach to another has lessons for social and behavioral scien- tists as well as a likely parallel with regard to constructivism and traditional behaviorism and associationism today (Campbell, 1975; Erickson, in press; Patton, 1973; Rist, in press). Following a major scientific achievement (e.g., Newton's Principia) scientists would work out the knots and puzzles within a "paradigm" where they never questioned their assumptions about relevant focus, such as Newton's laws of motion. Yet sooner or later anomalies come to be widely recognized and a crisis is recognized, as exemplified by failure of existing Newtonian theory to account for particle behavior when it approached the speed of light. Finally, Kuhn notes that a competing paradigm, as in this case Einstein's theory, has taken over and becomes the normal science. There are some good indications that educational re- search may have reached a crisis stage with regard to its major Fisherian experimental design tradition, and perhaps that the paradigm has never worked. At any rate schooling, teaching, and learning go on without being explicable via traditional ap- proaches, and serious doubts about methodology have been raised publicly from within the research community (Cronbach, 1975; Husen, 1974; Snow, 1974). Some examples may illustrate this dilemma in educational research more clearly and show that other reviewers have pro- vided some hints about constructivist approaches. Presumed links between particular instructional methods and student achievement have not been found after more than a half century of research (Berliner &amp; Gage, 1976; Duncan &amp; Biddle, 1974; Stephens, 1967). Stephens, whose work has largely been ignored, proposed that "humble forces" due to evolutionary development of the race have made human beings particularly adept at learning anything intended by mentors. Berliner and Gage pro- 653 MAGOON</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH posed to explain the lack of learning differences via Chomsky's constructivist notion of surface and deep structures, and suggested that surface differences are reconstructed into the same deeper meaning structures. It has often been assumed that Stephens' conclusions would be overturned by slightly more sophisticated examinations of how instructional methods inter- act or exhibit differential effects for different types of learners. This assumption has proven false in an important way; for strong, simple aptitude treatment interactions in school-like settings are very rare and searching for them may well be fruitless (Bracht &amp; Glass, 1968; Bracht, 1970; Cronbach, 1975). The reason for this state of affairs, according to Cronbach's account, is not that interactions do not occur, but that there are weak interactions with many things-in fact, usually too many in instructional research (p. 124). The dilemma is that more complex interactions have a tendency to hide the simpler ones ad in- finitum. What does Cronbach suggest to take the place of Fishe- rian techniques when the going gets too rough? He proposes that researchers simply but radically reverse the priority they have traditionally placed on building generalizations about effects of variables and give careful attention to particular cases first: "As he goes from situation to situation, his first task is to describe and interpret the effect anew in each locale, perhaps taking into account factors unique to that locale of series of events (cf. Geertz, 1973, Chap. 1, on thick description)" (p. 125). Although Cronbach does not specifically equate unique local factors with an examination of how participants in the situation "construct" or interpret it, as has been noted above, Geertz (1973) advocates this focus in social anthropological studies: "Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning" (p. 5). Geertz's "thick description" has enormous implications of which Cronbach seemed quite aware. Before getting further into this issue, it is important to note that as it turns out each proposal (Stephens', Berliner and Gage's, and Cronbach's) is consistent with construc- tivist assumptions, and such bellweather signs, in the face of an apparent methodological crisis, likely point toward a different focus ahead for educational research. This emerging field may not be well enough marked so that it is recognizable, but there are several studies of schooling and teachers stretching back more than twenty-five years that opted for "thick description" and hence focused on how teachers, administrators, and school children constructed and interpreted their situations. Bantock (1973) has called for this approach, but until quite recently there has been little advocacy of this ap- 654 Vol. 47. No. 4</page><page sequence="5">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH proach. Such studies as have been done have not been valued and consequently have remained unrecognized basically because the researchers took a different position on the question of whether one should be interested as a scientist in what minds construct. This in turn is the historic issue of epistemology in psychology and philosophy-i.e., the study or assumptions concerning what the mind knows and how it does so. What some have described as a cognitive revolution in psychology (Segal &amp; Stacy, 1975) is a return to an ancient concern for constructions of the mind that goes back to Aristotle and Plato (Baumrin, 1975; Weimer, 1973). For at least the last decade cognitive psychologists have felt comfortable in studying this type of phenomena for none other than the simple reason that it is there (Neisser, 1967, p. 5). There are many applications of the central tenets of cognitive psychol- ogy in educational research at either a structural level or a dynamic level, or both. The claim is made that a significant part of the context of behavior that educational researchers observe is a structure produced by the constructions of the observed subject. The dynamic focus, in contrast, proposes that educa- tional researchers examine acts of construction as they occur in schools (Mehan, Cazden, Coles, Fisher, &amp; Maroules, Note 1; Robinson, 1974). In this, one need not include the separate but key issue of motivation for the explanation of behavior (Neisser, 1967, Powers, 1973). Some of these proposals will be examined later in this review, after first tracing the roots of what appears to be a strange perspective to educational researchers, as well as the development of constructivist views in psychology and sociol- ogy. Philosophical Support Is there a philosophical tradition, aside from the more obvious humanism, that downplays the importance of the associationist explanation that a subject's behavior is a response to stimuli, and instead emphasizes that much important behavior is ac- tively constructed? The general answer is yes, for such familiar figures as Chomsky (1966) have long claimed that they have followed a different philosophical theme in linguistics. An illus- tration of constructions in this context might be seen when someone hears a question they have never heard before (i.e., interprets a new linguistic communication) and then answers the question or constructs a response. Recently an important litera- ture has emerged in the philosophies of educational research, education, and the social sciences, where the claim is made that such constructions should be the most highly-valued phenomena in the social and behavioral sciences. This section attempts to pull together several of these diverse writings to briefly show 655 MAGOON</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH that there is a coherent focus on constructions throughout and that these have traditionally been examined via special tech- niques called "analytic methods" since the time of the philoso- pher Kant. Analytic methods, in turn, bear a strong resemblance to the approach advocated indirectly by Cronbach and directly by Geertz for the simple reason that "thick descriptions" are in their lineage direct descendants of more recent British linguistic philosophers, especially the late Wittgenstein. It should be noted at the outset that there is a major develop- ment in Western philosophy that has taken place in the past sixty years, namely the (philosophical) analytic method that developed out of the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and his interest in the concept of "other minds." Wittgenstein concluded that philosophers must approach such problems of how other minds function in an empirical manner by making real-life observations concerning how such things work-the analytic method. Regardless of the strong impact this has had on philoso- phy today, it has the special effect of placing philosophical investigation close to psychological and sociological inquiry. Traditionally educational researchers had been advised that the only way to construct such things as definitions was through just the opposite kind of construction called synthetic definition, which is exemplified by classical operational definitions. In syn- thetic definition, the emphasis is on the putting together of various parts to form a definition. The distinction between "judgments" that were arrived at synthetically rather than analytically (where in the latter case meanings and definitions are arrived at through analysis and reconstruction) was first noted by Kant, who in the same sense that is preserved here saw the former process as "expansive" and the latter as "merely explicative" (Kant, 1949, p. 14). Analytic approaches should prob- ably enjoy equal status with synthetic operational procedures, for they are clearly heir to the same failings that have been pointed out about empirical definitions by Ennis (1973), Hempel (1956), and Waisman (1973). Perhaps the most obvious result of many analytic examina- tions of constructions would be the explication of rules that were either being constructed or being followed by the observed subject(s). There has been a certain amount of interest recently among educational philosophers in a similar notion which they describe as "rationality theories" (Hawkins, 1972; Nuthall &amp; Snook, 1973; Scheffler, 1960), but it is difficult to determine from their writing what the key assumptions are that distinguish "rationality theories" from other theories about behavior. Mar- tin (1970) found this conception needed to be liberalized in order to be more widely applicable. Rational in this sense literally means "endowed with the faculty of reason" (Random House 656 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="7">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH Dictionary, 1966). Marler (1974) has summarized the assumption of rational behavior as that behavior in which ".. . people usually intend the most probable consequences of their actions-even though they may err in estimating the actual consequences that follow a given action" (p. 304). This seems to be a central point of all discussions of "rationality theories." Historically this is the assumption about a science of human behavior that Mischel (1969) in a different context has traced back to the writings of Kant, who thought psychology had to deal with a special phenomena in comparison with sciences like physics, for exam- ple. The basic assumption derived from Kant, as Mischel notes (p. 17), is that man mostly comes to know his world by actively constructing it, and not so much by the passive reception of inputs. Thinking in Kant's view was "the unification of some diversity" on the basis of rules where the rules were either learned or themselves constructed by the individual. Baumrin (1975), in examining the importance of this assumption for cogni- tive psychology, found that Aristotle took this same epistemolog- ical position. The objection might be raised that this constructivist concern would perhaps provide valuable guidance to sociologists or an- thropologists, but is too comlex to be of much utility to educa- tional researchers at their present stage of sophistication. This is what is known as the reductionist argument; i.e., when behavior has been reduced and understood at an appropriately elemen- tary level, then more complex behavior may be studied appropri- ately by combining well-understood fundamental parts. Mean- ings and other abstractions, or constructions of behavior, so goes this reasoning, conjure up the image of a complex knowing agent. Countering this approach, constructivists would assert that the central virtue of their view is the assurance that research investigations would include an account of the social context of the phenomenon. It would require researchers to approach the phenomena as social psychologists, sociologists, and social an- thropologists, with corresponding attention to social definitions, rules, norms, values, etc. An antireductive stance is hardly a wild new idea, even with reference to modern psychology. The psychologist Guthrie nearly twenty years ago concluded that meanings of the situation to the organism were crucial to the explanation of either animal or human behavior (1959, p. 165). Tolman (1959) explicated a practi- cal way that purposive human behavior with which educational research should concern itself might be investigated: "... we might assert rather that the laws of sociology come first, since they determine the response ranges and the nature of the stimulus settings actually available to the individual ... ." p. 96. Some recent events in sociobiology and psychology point out 657 MAGOON</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH the more important assumption that Tolman's writing only hints at, namely, that biological and social evolution have left some responses so highly developed that it makes no sense at all to think about them in simplistic terms. A recent treatise entitled Sociobiology attempts to demonstrate that vastly different types of social behavior in animals has a biological basis as the result of Darwinian evolutionary development, with startling implica- tions for human behavior (Wilson, 1975). For example, animals close to man philogenetically (e.g., chimpanzees) are exceptional one-trial imitators and easily pass on such complex things as tool traditions in the natural habitat to offspring and others, as well as adopting particular social roles in monkey troops. Similar role playing and changing is a fundamental ingredient in human organization, Wilson speculates: "Human societies have effloresced to levels of extreme complexity because their mem- bers have the intelligence and flexibility to play roles of virtually any degree of specification, and to switch them as occasion demands" (p. 554). Reflecting on this and other similar works, Campbell (1975, in a presidential address to the APA) found that the case for sociocultural evolution-the selective cumulation of skills, technologies, beliefs, etc.-must be taken very seriously by psychologists, should be treated as adaptive and hence respected, and must be incorporated in any explanation of human behavior. The complexity of behavior that is constrained by the adaptive function of both biological and social evolution requires a special set of assumptions of psychologists: "... we need a purposive- behaviorist, cybernetic model of the biological individual, produc- ing a basic need to set goals and complete them, a self-indulgence in autonomy and self-direction even when this purpose-effecting serves no simpler self-serving motive" (p. 1119). This recent example of an exceptional antireductivist position, an emphasis on a primary phenomenon of role playing, is highly supportive of the constructivist claim that this is the basic phenomena that the sociobehavioral scientist has to work with. Many educational researchers would agree that human behav- ior might often be described as rule-following, but few have felt that how such rules are constructed and applied by persons should be rigorously examined. The reason for this is that practitioners generally hold preconceptions about what scientific methods are and about which phenomena are amenable to scien- tific analysis. Despite the usual credibility of a Campbell, the notion of studying the purposive acts of autonomous agents is thought to be at variance with assumptions about the necessity of limiting observation to "objective" and reliable phenomena (where reliability is determined in a special way) requisite for the construction of a science of human behavior; after all, hasn't such an orientation been of immense value in the development of 658 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="9">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH the natural sciences? More than a decade ago, this assumption that the social and behavioral sciences must mimic the methods of the physical sciences, was given detailed examination in a widely-read book by Kaplan (1964). He concluded that this as- sumption was a misconception that could be characterized as the "myth of methodology," for he found that "... methodology is very far from being a sufficient condition for scientific achieve- ment" (p. 24). The special domain of behavioral science is what should be emphasized, Kaplan argued, and that domain is its subject matter where signs, symbols, and meanings play a cru- cial role (p. 32). He furthermore concluded that although the interpretation of an act's meaning to actors might require special analytical techniques, these could be subject to the same methodological norms (e.g., validity) that apply to any research procedures. In other words, for many practicing educational researchers to seriously consider this approach as viable, they must at least be willing to concede that multiple scientific methods of studying the same phenomena are possible. Less well-known writers have made the point that the investigation of the meaning of terms should be one of the important tasks of scientific inquiry into certain kinds of human behavior. "Since the giving and grasping of meanings is the mechanism of much of the patterns of social interaction, greater precision of the deline- ation of meanings is what corresponds in the social sciences to the development of greater accuracy of measurement of parame- ters in the physical sciences" (Harre &amp; Secord, 1972, p. 132). It is probably fair to say that such views have had little influence on the general set of rules which practicing researchers in educa- tion consider as their norms of scientific activity. Several essays in a recent National Society for the Study of Education Yearbook, Philosophical Redirection of Educational Research (Thomas, 1972) elaborated on implicit themes of re- search on autonomous rule-applying agents in an educational context, and several writers examined philosophical assumptions held by educational researchers. Gowin (1972), like Kaplan, found that when analytic philosophers carefully examine education, the phenomena turn out to be quite unlike those in the physical sciences (p. 9-10). For that reason, Gowin suggested, the kinds of regularities researchers would find in educational phenomena would have been socially conditioned by normative judgments such as rules, policies, and value judgments. Dunkel (1972) agrees with Gowin that some kind of normative base must be recognized as underlying education if education is to be more than a "mindless technology," and proposed that the construc- tion of an educational philosophy rooted in a central concept of human rationality would be an important first step. Krimmer- man (1972) outlined a similar science of autonomy. This advice is 659 MAGOON</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH not more specific, unfortunately, and is difficult to connect directly to research practice. Scriven (1972), in this same collection of essays, has examined the concept of "reliability" as it is presently understood by educational researchers. He found that there exists a fundamen- tal confusion between the terms objectivity and subjectivity, and concluded that if certain precautions were taken, subjective reports could be classified as reliable. He provided the following example: If we can test someone's claim on a very large number of occasions and find him extremely reliable, we have good reason to believe him on other occasions when he testified about events of a kind that we know to exist even though we cannot check them directly ourselves; that is, unless we know of some pervasive source of error about such testimony by him that overrides the prima facie case we can build up from his usual reliability. (p. 96) The traditional association of reliability and factuality with reports from or observations on multiple research subjects (rather than assuming that reliability is independent of the number of observers) has led to what Scriven describes as the fallacy of methodological behaviorism: "... the view that, with- out committing oneself to any stand about the reality of mental states . . . it is good methodological practice to ignore them" (p. 101). Were traditional objections to self-reports to be overcome, Scriven suggests that educational researchers would naturally pay more attention to people's reasons for action in contrast to their present attempts to determine causal accounts of it. The writing of Levine (1974), Peters (1960, 1974) and Taylor (1970) generally supports Scriven's points here. Analytic philosophers and linguists have offered cautionary and general advice regarding how one determines meaning, and agree that this results from a series of inferences (Alston, 1964; Black, 1968; Green, 1971). Philosophical writing in sociology has examined an issue that bears on validity of proposed meanings: Is an observer's understanding of an act by an actor a validation of that phenomena? The discussion has focused on Weber's doctrine of verstehen (understanding), which is the assumption that an act's meaning to the actor can be explained in at least one way: Place the observer in the actor's situation and see what meaning he then gives to the action. Truzzi (1974) has recently collected an excellent series of essays on this topic, mainly for sociologists, yet readable by the initiated. Petri (1972) concluded that with reference to educational research what ought to be emphasized in regard to the verstehen is that human action (i.e., movement that is intended) is just as observable as any human 660 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="11">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH behavior. Strike (1972) found that the concept of verstehen is defensible against many kinds of criticisms, but that that under- standing via verstehen should not be confused with explanation of such behavior. Kaplan (1964) would clearly opt for external validation: "... the operation of verstehen is an inferential and problematic as are those of cryptanalyses. Its outcome is familiar and, generally speaking, reliable, but it does not constitute its own validation" (p. 143). Martin (1970, p. 164) generally agrees with this conclusion. In summary one might say that through the verstehen approach the researcher is in a position much like a member of the audience in a play, attempting to pull together hints, consistencies, and patterns in order to answer the ques- tion: What did the actor mean by that? The audience or jury might then provide the set of inferences-that is, the meaning of acts for further scientific analysis, or as final results in a particular inquiry. Not only would such an enterprise require special reconcep- tions of reliability and validity, but they would also demand a reformulation of scientific "ends," i.e., what the end product of scientific effort would be. Both Scriven and Kaplan have argued that the end product of scientific inquiry into human behavior need not be prediction of that behavior (although prediction would be quite useful) but simply be explanation without predic- tion. As Kaplan has put the case: "... if we look at the explana- tions without being able to predict, that is, without being in a position where we could have predicted if only we had had the explanation in time" (p. 347). Two models of explanation were described by Kaplan, each of which he suggests may be universal in application: the pattern model of explanation, whereby we know the reason for something when it fits into a known pattern; and the deductive model, where a reason is deduced from known truths (p. 347). Instead of traditional null hypothesis tests of a statistical nature being the final arbiters of research findings, one could instead evaluate one account of a situation (e.g., a pattern of intentional relationships between teachers and pupils) and weigh this account against other accounts or the proposition that there is no pattern in the situation at all. Gradually one pattern would be recognized as the scientific explanation of that particular type of situation and would probably be recognized as a weak form of prediction. It can generally be concluded that analytic and Kantian phi- losophers have taken a strong interest in how a science of human behavior should be conducted, and are strongly supportive of social science research that would attend to what has been called the constructivist metaphor for such inquiry. Most who have written for educational audiences have not been very specific about how such assumptions have or could be brought into a 661 MAGOON</page><page sequence="12">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH research account, and educational researchers have for many reasons not been paying much attention to this theme. The program that these philosophers outline is adaptable to the present research framework in much of psychology and educa- tional research and has been utilized for years. The assumption that meanings should be the prime considerations in some types of research does not necessarily place this inquiry beyond the pale of a liberal behaviorism, much less empiricism, for many have argued that meanings are often to be empirically assessed and multiply-inferred through such things as observations of behavior. Applications of traditional statistical analyses and tests should be utilized whenever possible, but strictly as ser- vants of a somewhat different enterprise. Proposals for a More Constructivist Psychology There is also a literature in psychology that supports the claim that constructions and rules should be a central focus for inquiry (Neisser, 1967). The study of the application of a special set of rules has a long history in psychology, stretching back to the seventeenth century in the case of models of the nature and development of language (Chomsky, 1966). Chomsky has pointed out that such a focus offers a general alternative to S-R concep- tualizations (1970, p. 450). Indeed, grammars are powerful sets of rules that are utilized almost universally by human beings. The major influence toward a more constructivist psychology, how- ever, has been the research and writing of Jean Piaget. He has consistently adhered to what he calls "structuralist" philo- sophical position over the nearly half-century of his inquiry into cognitive development. He has asserted that in any particular content area of the human sciences (a) structural models are sufficient for conducting research, and (b) furthermore offer: "... an ideal (perhaps a hope) of intrinsic intelligibility" (1970, p. 9). In other words, Piaget is saying here that research can be done on various levels of the phenomenon (e.g., physiological, physical behavior, meaningful behavior) and that some of the higher levels are more amenable to inquiry because they make more "sense" to human investigators. The Russian psychologist and linguist, Vigotsky (1962), followed such advice in his work forty years ago. At about the same time the writings of the American social psychologist George Mead (1964) assigned "meaning of actions" a central place. He argued that, in order to account for many types of human behavior, one must take into account a great variety of socially-defined rules of meaning. The Mead tradition is alive and well in sociology today (Glaser &amp; Straus, 1968). The best known treatise on intended meaningful behavior is 662 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="13">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH Miller, Gallanter, and Pribram's Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), which was proposed from within the American psychological tradition. Drawing heavily in the construction of their model on a philosophical analysis of human action provided by C. I. Lewis (very similar to those of Kaplan and Peters), they proposed a simple psychological structure for the representation of intelligent self-initiated behavior. Lewis observed that (cited in Miller, Gallanter, &amp; Pribram, p. 71): "Knowledge, action and evaluation are essentially connected." Miller, Gallanter, and Pribram constructed a psychological analogue that would repre- sent such a connection. This is the well-known Test-Operate- Test-Exit (TOTE) unit, which they claimed at a minimum ".. . as- serts simply that the operations an organism performs are constantly guided by the outcomes of various tests" (p. 29). The implications of focusing on "plans" are far reaching; for example, they found that the "roles" of traditional role theory should be redefined in terms of the plans the role taker expects to execute. Along these same lines, Powers (1973) has more recently pro- posed that all behavior might best be described as control of perception, while perceptions themselves were constructed by a nervous system modeled after an analogue computer. In sum- mary, one could take a systems theory approach to the explana- tion of behavior that is highly compatible with constructivist assumptions. Recent critical reviews of behavioral psychology (Peters, 1974; Toulmin, 1970) have argued for more constructivist approaches. Ironically there is a perspective and empirical tradition in mod- ern psychology that is highly consistent with the proposals of the critics regarding what the focus of modern psychology ought to be, and that is the study of what has been termed "common-sense psychology" by Heider (1958) and his intellectual descendants in attribution theory, Weiner (1973). Heider's view of man was rooted in the German phenomenological tradition, which is philo- sophically based on a Kantian orientation, and Heider was well aware of the close tie between analytic philosophy and his studies of what he called "naive psychology." He felt that formal scientific psychology could benefit greatly by the careful, often analytic analysis of common everyday understanding and rela- tionships and combined this with empirical work on everyday human perceptions of causality. Harre and Secord (1972) have recently proposed a far-reaching reconstruction of psychology that rests mainly on constructivist assumptions, by means of a science that need not seek causal linkages (i.e., nonpositivist). They reject mechanistic models or metaphors, and claim that a science of human behavior can be "anthropomorphic": "In treating people like priests, actors, or players we are departing from the mechanical model, which 663 MAGOON</page><page sequence="14">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH assumes that the attributes of such entities as people can be treated as parameters-some parameters held constant, others varied" (p. 16). Their man-as-an-object-of-scientific-inquiry bears a close resemblance to the TOTE unit (p. 93). American developmental psychology, no doubt due to the in- fluence of Piaget's work, evidences many "structuralist" tenden- cies. Reese and Overton (1970), in a discussion of "behaviorist" vs. "organismic" (i.e., structural) models of development, make the following distinctions: The epistomological position that derives from the organic model of man is constructivism. It asserts that the knower, on the basis of his inherent activity and organization, ac- tively participates in the construction of known reality.... The acceptance of the active organism model has implica- tions for the acceptance of various theories and techniques. The individual who accepts this model will tend to emphasize the significance of processes over products, and qualitative changes over quantitative changes. (p. 134) Segal and Stacy (1975) have, in a similar vein, discussed the power of the concept of rule-governed constructive behavior in cognitive psychology. They have gone so far as to posit that rule-governed behavior is the central unreducible phenomena in this field (p. 544). These researchers also would utilize pattern explanation and a somewhat more generalized TOTE unit as the representation of an act, argued that behavior need not be reduced further than acts in order to be effectively analyzed, and concluded that explanations of behavior will have closer "con- nections with lay explanations" of the same phenomena. It is difficult to gauge the eventual impact of this kind of thinking on the metaphors that educational researchers employ and methods they use to conduct their inquiries, but something of a "cognitive revolution" with linguistic, structural, or or- ganismic facets appears to be sweeping psychology. It is this literature that ought to be recognized as a valuable addition to the psychological tradition in educational research, since it pro- vides an important link between the phenomena and nontradi- tional methodology. Criticisms of constructivist approaches will no doubt soon appear in quantity. Skinner (1974), a prominent behaviorist, has recently given extended attention to struc- turalism and rule-following behavior; and he found that these approaches tell how people behave (a descriptive account) rather than answer the question of why (lawful mechanism). Skinner thus prefers a reductive approach that ignores autonomous constructions and hopes for an explanation like those he sees in the natural sciences. 664 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="15">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH Constructivist Sociology Much of the impetus for constructivist educational research comes however from present day sociological researchers who trace their roots to German idealism with its central concern for constructions. In the recent Handbook of Research on Teaching, Snow (1973) wrote about the need for educational researchers to find new and better metaphors by which teaching could be studied, and it should be recognized that these sociologists utilize a metaphor similar to that enunciated in the eighteenth century by Kant: Observe teachers and students as active constructors of their knowledge and rules, who are often capable of autonomous acts based on their applications of knowledge and rules. Many sociologists today would further agree that there certainly are limits as to what comes to be constructed, and an account needs to be taken of external structural constraints that have a heavy influence on individual constructions (Berger &amp; Luckman, 1966; Gellner, 1974; Sharp &amp; Green, 1975). For example, in many of the ethnographic analyses in educational situations, the central question is whether particular types of constraints were operat- ing, such as a "tendency" for middle-class teachers to dissociate themselves from lower-class school children. Acknowledgement that such "social facts" exist raises a central question for sociological theory and points out the task of the sociology of knowledge say Berger and Luckman. "How is it possible that subjective meanings become objective facticities?" (p. 50). At least three different strands descending from the idealist position are prominent in the sociological literature today, that of Weber (1949), Winch (1958), and Schutz (1970). Weber, writing at the turn of this century, gave an early detailed analysis of the problem that subjective meanings raised for the social scientist, and initiated a sociological concern for action as meaningful behavior. Winch, writing from a British analytic tradition, out- lined the objectives of a social science of rule-following persons in The Idea of a Social Science (1958), and was especially concerned that students of the social sciences become aware of the differ- ence between the science of "natural" phenomena and events having a social construction. Schutz (1970), following the lead of the phenomenalist philosopher Husserl, independently came to the same conclusion: ". .. the constructs of the social sciences are constructs of the second degree, namely constructs of the con- structs made by actors on the social scene, whose behavior the social scientist has to observe and explain..." (p. 272). There is no clearer example of sociological research in the "meaningful actions" tradition than that of Goffman (1969a, 1969b, 1971), who distinguishes his focus on dynamic role enact- ment or role performance from more traditional Parsonian con- 665 MAGOON</page><page sequence="16">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ceptions of a static social role. The theme for Goffman is "man the actor" who can take on several roles sequentially, and the locus of his research is largely face-to-face public interaction where roles are in a sense "picked up" by participants in common everyday occurrences. Garfinkle (1967) has had a far more impor- tant influence on educational studies, even though his aim is much more complicated than Goffman's and more difficult to accomplish. Utilizing an "ethnomethodological" approach the sociologist can, claims Garfinkle, determine how activities are understood by participants: "Ethnomethodological studies analyze everyday activities as member's methods for making those same activities visibly-rational-and-reportable-for-all- practical-purposes-i.e., accountable as organizations of common- place everyday activities" (p. vii). Cicourel and Kitsuse (1963) applied this methodology, really a special variant of general ethnographic techniques, to the study of students and guidance counselors in a large mid-western high school, and Mehan et al. (Note 1) have likewise used this approach in a study of first- grade interactions. These types of ethnographies will be dealt with below, and merely point out the connection to deeper sociological themes. It is difficult to estimate whether ordinary sociologists understand the ramifications of this rather non- positivist half of their background, but some claim that this revolution is nearly complete in sociology (Douglas, 1970). Anthropology has long evidenced a systematic interest in constructions of the mind, particularly primitive minds, with perhaps the most famous recent work being Levi-Strauss The Savage Mind (1966). Reviewing voluminous ethnographic an- thropological studies-i.e., external descriptive studies-led Levi-Strauss to conclude that primitive classification schemes, a construction in the sense used here, have an apparent intrinsic value of their own: ".. . founded on a demand for order" (p. 10). In a word, the savage mind is capable of very complex, systematic thought with a logic of its own. Wax and Wax (1971) and Cohen (1971) have recently made the point that anthropological methods could be fruitfully employed in the studying of schooling in one's own culture. Cohen in a sense extends the Levi-Strauss theme: "... educational institutions and others involved in the self-perpetuation of culture through the shaping of mens' minds-are amenable to, the same modes of analysis that have been developed by anthropologists to study kinship and mar- riage, etc" (p. 47). Recently, just this kind of approach to barrio schooling has been taken by Ogbu (1974) who as an an- thropologist visited an American ghetto school system and in the process examined social stratification effects on children and teachers. Few other studies of educational phenomena have been undertaken with Ogbu's scope, although many have had a much 666 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="17">CONSTRUICTIVIST RESEARCH smaller field and have hence been dubbed "micro-ethnographies" (Burnett, 1973, Smith &amp; Geoffrey, 1968). A review of some exam- ples constitutes the bulk of the following section. Recently educational researchers have taken an increasing interest in anthropological ethnographic approaches to phenomena, and how this conforms to scientific theory develop- ment (Lutz &amp; Ramsay, 1974; Overholt &amp; Stallings, 1976). Often in this context reference is made to the anthropologist Malinowski's pioneering ethnographic approach to such things as native cul- ture on South Pacific islands, and the point that is often made is that educational researchers could profitably apply such tech- niques to school situations in this culture (Rist, 1975). Indeed, Malinowski's approach is classic "thick description," where the meaning of events to the natives involved was the central purpose for the voluminous observations, analysis, and years of involvement. The key to the success of such an account for Malinowski was to have it corroborated by some of the partici- pants, i.e., an especially perceptive native informant. This vali- dation strategy has been independently argued to be central in a reconstructed social science (Harre &amp; Secord, 1972), and has been recently practiced by Mehan et al. (Note 1) as educational re- searchers in a teacher-pupil interaction study. It is at the heart of a constructivist validation scheme. Malinowski put this point well at the time his ethnography was published on the life, economy, agriculture, magic, and religion of the Trobrianders (Coral Gardens and their Magic, 1935), which he felt was the best of his eleven works; this was due in his view to the good fortune he had in having a very wise and concerned native review the ethnographer's interpretations of native magic, wording of spells, and meanings of these things to the natives. Malinowski made the case very strongly: "To a large extent my informants are responsible for the correct interpretation and perspective, for the sincerity and relevance of what is contained in these vol- umes..." (p. x). The important methodological lesson is that ethnographic studies often should be joint cooperative enter- prises where the integrity of the participants' views are to be carefully maintained. Applications in Education There appear to be a few dozen published studies of a variety of general educational phenomena that clearly illustrate how "thick description" or constructive ethnographies have been accomplished, and these approaches have typically been de- scribed as qualitative (Erickson, in press; Rist, in press), phenomenological (Busis, Chittenden, &amp; Amarel, 1976), Lewinian (Baker &amp; Wright, 1955; Bronfenbrenner, 1976), microethno- 667 MAGOON</page><page sequence="18">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH graphic (Burnett, 1973; Smith &amp; Geoffrey, 1968), ethnomethodolog- ical (Cicourel &amp; Kitsuse, 1963), or sociolinguistic (Cicourel, Jen- nings, K. H., Jennings, S. H. M., Leiter, MacKay, Mehan, &amp; Roth, 1974). Table 1 reveals that constructivist applications are clearly discernable within six facets of educational research; from clas- sic system-wide anthropological ethnographies, closer studies of teachers and administrators, and sociolinguistic analyses of classroom exchanges to a relatively large set of methodological and philosophical proposals some of which have been cited above, and applications in both educational evaluation and measure- ment. This literature has been assembled to demonstrate that there is a body of educational research that displays central elements reasonably consistent with constructivist assumptions, but is too extensive to review in detail. A few studies have been selected as representative of how a constructivist analysis has been applied in each area, and the particular approach of each briefly reviewed. The criteria for quality research here involves both a slightly different definition of reliability, and an emphasis on construct validation. The scientific goal, as has been noted at several points above, is often not the traditional one of accurate prediction but instead the careful description and validation of a patterned set of interrelationships. The following is a brief summary of examples of reliability concerns, validation strate- gies, and scientific objectives found in constructivist educational research studies. Certain types of reliability, such as that evidenced when the same observation or measure is taken on two different occasions (e.g., test-retest reliability), have been of little interest to con- structivists, perhaps because of a basic assumption that the flow of events in the ancient phenomenological sense causes construc- tions to be altered somewhat in order to account for the new information. Single observers or groups must be assessed via the "credible witness" tests outlined above by Scriven (1972); and/or should provide "specimen records" of observed behavior which according to Barker and Gump (1964) have high utility in normal social intercourse: "The whole experience of mankind indicates this method is sufficiently reliable for many kinds of personal understandings..." (p. 213). Multiple observers with the same focus, however, would be expected to produce accounts that corroborated with the others, but in normal anthropological ethnographies this often would not be worth the expense in- volved and the other criteria would have to suffice. In ethnographic school studies it sometimes turns out that multiple observers are a manageable problem in the sense that the time span and field are sharply limited, as exemplified by the Tikunoff, Berliner, and Rist (Note 2) study of 40 classrooms. In this study 16 pairs of highly-trained ethnographic raters were 668 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="19">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH assigned the task of rating teachers' protocols dichotomously on approximately sixty dimensions, and for more than half these dimensions ethnographers agreed with between 75 and 100 per- cent accuracy as to where the teacher should be placed (p. 68). Such reliability seemed to these researchers to be very promis- ing, and constitutes the only known case where specific ethno- graphic interpretations on fairly narrow dimensions such as "awareness of developmental levels" have been multiply assessed. The strengths of ethnographic studies are claimed to lie in their heavy emphasis on validity (Rist, in press). and, as one might expect, the emphasis is on construct validation-the mean- ing of events or situations to participants-rather than tradi- tional predictive or concurrent validation. Whereas predictive and concurrent validity are limited by low correlational esti- mates of reliability, construct validity depends to a large degree on reliability in the "credible witness" and/or "specimen record" sense. A good example of this emphasis is found in Busis, Chittenden, and Amarel, Beyond Surface Curriculum (1976), where they conducted in-depth interviews of sixty teachers in a new phenomenalistic/ethnographic approach: "By its very na- ture, then, a revised paradigm for research would have to be as much concerned with the quality of experience and the meaning of behavior as with the occurrence of the behavior, and it would not assume that similar behavioral expressions by different people have the same meanings" (p. 14). Other educational researchers, applying more of an ethnomethodological approach to classroom instructional settings, are unaware that they utilize the old validation criterion first described by Malinowski as the hallmark of a successful ethnography (Mehan et al.. Note 1): "... insure that the structure of the events described by the researcher converges with the structure of events held by partic- ipants in the event" (p. 12). Other cases for the validity of findings are similar to those (e.g., Barker &amp; Wright, 1955; Becker, Geerz, &amp; Hughes, 1968; Ogbu, 1974; Patton, 1973; Smith, 1974). More exacting standards regarding validity have been enun- ciated by Geertz (1973) who considers evidence for consistency and elaboration of meaning important but secondary criteria for high-quality ethnographies. The primary concern should be for how well the ethnographer fits his description of what might be called a social discourse into a theoretical exploration (p. 20): Cultural analysis is (or should be) guessing at meanings, assessing the guesses, and drawing explanatory conclusions from the better guesses.... (p. 20) It was in just such a vein that Ogbu (1974) concluded that one of the major implications from his findings was that the historical 669 MAGOON</page><page sequence="20">os 0) Table 1 Constructivist Perspectives in Educational Research (i.e., where the constructed reality/meanings of the observed participants was the primary focus) Author, Title, Date Setting and Focus (P = Participant Observer) Some Conclusions I.

The real function of schooling may be related more to the social demands of established interests than developing talent. An innovative "open" school is led by crusaders and mostly green staff, and all finally bow to hard realities of mass schooling. Intellectual and artistic values occupied a central place in the value hierarchy, but physical labor left little room for this in the developing personality. Commitment to appropriate philosophy is necessary for teachers to successfully implement open education; committed teachers are enormously influenced by outside advisors in implementing open education.</page><page sequence="22">Table 1 (Continued) Constructivist Perspectives in Educational Research (i.e., where the constructed reality/meanings of the observed participants was the primary focus) Author, Title, Date Setting and Focus (P = Participant Observer) Some Conclusions Cicourel, Kitsuse.

Test-taking and test-scoring are often interpretive and interrac- tional processes; poor performance may well be due to the structure of the interrogational situation rather than inherent lack of ability in the case of minority examinees. Meanings are falsely tied to content validity, because of ambivalence toward measurement variability and the behaviorist legacy of a product-and-outcome-oriented ide- ology; assumptions and ideologies must be confronted and examined. The best option for studying such phenomena appears to be anthropological direct observation and qualitative assessment.</page><page sequence="30">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH relationships of blacks, Chicanos, and the dominant white class has had a profound effect on ghetto educational patterns today, even though this remains largely unarticulated by the minority members themselves, yet symbolized by massive school failure. The "historic roots" explanation, given scientists might believe in the efficacy of historic causes, is a special process of construct validation reappearing again in a different guise (Geertz, 1973): "In ethnography, the office of theory is to provide a vocabulary in which what symbolic action has to say about itself-that is, about the role of culture in human life-can be expressed" (p. 27). With a special form of construct validation as a major scientific standard, ethnographic studies can hardly be described as radi- cal departures from current scientific ideals in educational re- search. The scientific goals for constructivist educational research studies have recently been given a detailed examination by Overholt and Stallings (1976), who distinguish between (a) the traditional educational research hypothesis test and (b) the generation of hypotheses as a result of ethnographic accounts of how a particular situation can be explained within the framework of a more general theory. The generation of specific hypotheses of this nature, which fit ethnographic facts, could lead to a further testing of such hypotheses in the more tradi- tional hypothetico-deductive model. Hanson (1961) has argued that this is the basic route of scientic discovery; and the sociologists, Glaser and Strauss, in The Discovery of Grounded Theory (1968), view theory as a never-ending process when facts are constantly brought into consideration via such processes as ethnographies. Smith and Geoffrey (1968) used just such an approach in the microethnographic analysis of an urban class- room, and offer one of the best statements anywhere about the general goals of such research: The argument we are making is that our observations make us privy to an immense number of sequences of events. As we try to shape these into empirical and conceptual order, hypotheses arise. In checking back to the written record we keep looking for the exception to our generalizations that would make the model less credible. As we find consequences congruent with the model, we move toward greater credibil- ity. In all of this it is not possible to attach clear .05 or .01 probability statements. Nonetheless, the strategy seems sig- nificant and important. (p. 161) At this point, the discussion turns from general concerns to focus on specific examples of constructivist applications in edu- cational research on school systems or school-related com- munities (see Table 1, Section I, System-Wide Ethnographies). 680 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="31">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH These appear similar in several respects to classic anthropologi- cal ethnographies in the Malinowski tradition, almost all were participant observer studies, many were of more than one year's duration, and each has a strong although different theoretical orientation toward constructions and how such findings are validated. For example, the Barker studies (Barker &amp; Wright, 1955; Barker &amp; Gump, 1964) were designed to examine the Lewinian notion of "lifespace" and placed heavy emphasis on elaborate specimen record sets and commonsense interpreta- tions of situations; the more social systems-oriented Smith and Keith (1971) analysis of an innovative school draws heavily on writings about noninterferring sociological field studies and relies on verbatim accounts of meetings and announcements to describe school evolution. These authors seem in the end very credible witnesses indeed, and extensive care has been taken in each book to preserve extensive raw observations, dialogues, specimen records, or other materials for the reader's own in- terpretation and validation check. Two of these studies warrant further attention because of the importance of their findings and their exemplary methodology. The heavily anthropological Ogbu study was directed at the American urban barrio/ghetto "folk system" (i.e., constructed social reality) and depended on interviews, questionnaires, other documents, and observation. Ogbu spent 21 months on this study, had formal ties with two neighborhood associations, built up an elaborate network of informants, interviewed more than 225 students, and surveyed more than 100 families and 40 of them intensively in follow-ups. He also interviewed many middle-class residents of the nearby city as to their views on substantive issues, and visited and observed in the schools. Ogbu was in- terested in historical, cultural, and structural factors that influ- enced the "folk system," and in this regard leveled a criticism at the traditional American belief that the child is largely responsi- ble for his own success or failure. Ogbu presents informant evidence to bolster his claim that the most fundamental factor in the schooling failure evidenced by "subordinate minorities" is the historic lack of correspondence between schooling and social attainment or betterment within this group, due largely to societal prejudice against much minority groups. Schooling for that reason is held in low repute, and special accommodations are constructed by the group: They generally complain that they are getting a 'dirty deal.' What my informants repeatedly implied is that they have not been adequately rewarded for their educational accomplish- ments. It seems to me it is for this reason that Burgersiders (ghetto residents) ... have developed the types of attitudes 681 MAGOON</page><page sequence="32">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH that prevent them from actually competing effectively in schools. This adaptation developed as a collective response to a situation they faced as a group rather than as individ- uals.... (p. 257) The responsibility for such school failure, Ogbu concludes, lies in the larger community which even fails to examine its own myths about minority school failure. Were other ethnographies done, would the educational research community be bold and sophisti- cated enough to accept such conclusions? A second excellent study in this group was done in a very different location, at a working-class school in Britain, by two sociologists who spent a year observing and participating in the school and its community (Sharp &amp; Green, 1975). Though an "open" primary school, they claimed the effect of external social structure was pronounced and had an effect contrary to the professed commitments and causes the teachers espoused. Their assumptions were that schooling is a political process (p. x), teachers and pupils were best described as actors who participate in their ". .. own conceptualization construction of the world .. ." (p. 5), and that other social structures within which actors are embedded must be dealt with (p. 26). Such structures could, on the one hand, be time and space constraints; and: "Other signifi- cant aspects of resource and restraint which constitute the teacher's situation which can be clearly seen as social, arise from the expectations of her by other actors in the situation such as other teachers, the headmaster, and a wider structure of profes- sional colleagues outside the school, parents, etc" (p. 31). The authors conclude that although the open classroom depends on the teacher "knowing the child," paradoxically constraints within and beyond the classroom drastically limit what gets known, and hence many students learn the hidden curriculum which passes on the message that they do not matter. The authors propose that social stratification emerges because teachers attend to th-se students who count socially: "Thus, whilst teachers display a moral concern that every child matters, in practice there is a subtle process of sponsorship developing where opportunity is being offered to some and closed off to others" (p. 218). Finally, Sharp and Green suggest that educators will continue to be unwilling victims of a structure that under- mines their moral concerns unless they attend to their own "structural location" and the necessity of political action. If these two examples and their conclusions strain credibility as scientific endeavors for many traditional educational re- searchers, it is because societal and cultural values are very much a part of what is said and seen. Studies in the second category (see Table 1, Section II, Teachers, Administrators) 682 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="33">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH would seem closer to traditional educational research because they appear to be less like cultural anthropology and more like school case studies. These are cases with a difference, however, because these are examples of how small groups or individual teachers or administrators construct their respective worlds. McPherson (1972), for example, presents a systematic but per- sonal account of how she managed the teacher role and saw it evolve over several years of teaching in a small school; a much broader questionnaire survey by Lortie (1975) sought to assess how teachers personally conceived of their work roles and gauged their efficacy. One of the best examples of constructivist research with this focus is an in-depth interview study of teacher beliefs about curriculum, teaching approaches, and open education conducted at several different locations by Bussis, Chittenden, and Amarel entitled Beyond Surface Curriculum, (1976). They began with what they described as an "interactivist" position regarding the centrality of teacher understanding and constructs: "This posi- tion assumes that internal mental processes (such as under- standings, beliefs, and values) are major underlying determi- nants of behavior and the environments that people create" (p. 1). The indepth interviews were aimed at eliciting internalized assumptions and constructs about teaching, and showed in part that teacher priorities for both cognitive and social development could be placed along a continuum from narrow (e.g., cognitive knowledge of grade-level facts) to comprehensive (e.g., social awareness and acceptance of self). Overall the researchers felt that such a gradation represented commitment to a deeper construct of the "child-as-resource," and presented other coded anecdotal data to show how some teachers saw open classroom teaching as largely process of inquiry for themselves as well as the children. Section III of Table 1 (Classroom Communications) is about "classroom interaction," but not for the traditional behavioral reasons for finding links between teacher and pupil behavior (Flanders, 1970). These were done instead for purposes that seem to satisfy Westbury's (1971) criticism of traditional classroom interaction analysis as lacking in concern for the internal mean- ings of these social actions. This research ranges from what the authors describe as microethnographies (Burnett, 1973; Smith &amp; Geoffrey, 1968), e.g., the rules and meanings relevant to tiny cultures like classrooms; to linguistic analyses of classroom interchanges between minority school children and teachers (Cazden, John, &amp; Hymes, 1972; Cicourel et al., 1974). The linguists and others generally subscribe to a phrasing of the instructional communications problem articulated by Bernstein (1972): "If the culture of the teacher is to be in the consciousness of the child, 683 MAGOON</page><page sequence="34">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH then the culture of the child must be in the consciousness of the teacher" (p. 149). The book length report on a single classroom Mehan et al. (Note 1) is indirectly related to this issue and sought to show how both teachers and students worked to put together classroom events such as reading lessons, following the ethnomethodological format of Garfinkle and Cicourel. The study exhibits some of the highest standards with respect to paradig- matic reliability and validity. For example, an elaborate set of specimen records taken from video-tapings (both the original transcript and interpretations) is contained in a 100-page appen- dix, and a convergence between the researchers' and the partici- pants' perspectives was sought. The authors concluded that, in addition to the academic demands classroom interaction places on students, there are two different types of normative demands (social rules that must usually be followed)-communicative competence and interpretive skills. Communicative competence involves knowing that certain ways of talking and acting are appropriate, and interpretive competence requires that implicit or tacit classroom rules be picked up by the student. An implica- tion to be drawn from this study is that normative competence may be an important part of the teacher's "culture" in Bern- stein's terms, but teachers may not be "conscious" of the norma- tive competence of students. Section IV of Table I, entitled Philosophical and Methodologi- cal Proposals, shows there have been several constructivist proposals for a different but legitimate branch of educational research, and most of these have been cited above. Two highly relevant discussions of aspects of this model are contained in separate chapters of the Second Handbook of Research on Teach- ing (Travers, 1973), one by Nuthall and Snook (1973) where a brief discussion of "rational models" took place and is equivalent to "rule constructing and following" as it has been used in this discussion; and a chapter by Bidwell on the Social Psychology of Teaching (1973). Bidwell described how Newcomb's ABX theory might be applicable as a "personal influence" model in teaching, where teaching itself would be defined normatively, and often best observed "naturalistically." Bidwell's is one of the most detailed and complete constructivist proposals in the educational research literature. A few recent educational evaluation reports and proposals evidence a constructivist point of view, as Section V of Table 1 indicates. Partlett and Hamilton (1975) make a strong theoretical case for "illuminative evaluation" describable as a social anthropological approach to evaluation, which contrasted with traditional agronomy models (i.e., experimental and quasi-experimental de- signs) seemed to them to represent a Kuhnian paradigmatic 684 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="35">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH shift. They note that the primary concern is not with prediction and measurement, but with description and interpretation: "It aims to discover what it is like to be participating in the scheme, whether as a teacher or a pupil, and, in addition, to discern and discuss the innovation's most significant features, reoccuring concomitants, and critical processes" (p. 144). The evaluative study over more than a year's time of a CAI math drill project in American "rural highlands" by Smith and Pohland (1974) was recognized by Parlett and Hamilton as one of the best educa- tional applications of this type. Indeed these evaluators make their own case for utilization of a Malinowskian inquiry process, and make a particularly strong point that various publics ought to see such results as credible because of a complex validation strategy involving field notes, documents, and summary obser- vations in a generalization of a multimethod, multitrait proce- dure called the "multimethod, multiperson, multisituational, multivariable matrix" (p. 48). Their major conclusions were that (a) teachers showed large variability with regard to CAI utiliza- tion, and (b) that CAI evoked a complex response having physi- cal, cognitive, emotional, and social aspects. A constructivist perspective seems well-established in educational evaluation. The same cannot be said about the field of educational mea- surement, Section VI of Table 1, for there has been little profes- sional interest in broadening disciplinary guidelines so that such activities as ethnographies would somehow be classified as "reli- able and valid." Hastings (1969), for example, criticized the field for its dependence on psychology and noted that anthropological techniques ought to be utilized in educational measurement, but there has been no response from within the discipline and the applied literature in this category has been written by outsiders in sociology. Messick (1975) has recently reviewed the status of constructs, meanings, and values in the educational measure- ment community that are highly relevant issues in this discus- sion and concluded that these basic concepts have not been considered relevant to educational measurement concerns be- cause other criteria such as predictive and content validity have been considered sufficient. This position is scientifically in- adequate, Messick points out in a carefully-reasoned argument, because: ". .. the meaning of the measure must also be pondered in order to evaluate responsibly the possible consequences of the proposed use" (p. 956). Educational measurement comes close to being the enterprise of a narrow ideological cult, of the type that Hudson (1972) wrote about in other parts of psychology, where here the domain of the cult is found in the limited concern for behavioral facts as anything more than ends in themselves (cf. Messick, 1975). Examples of a concern for what some educational measures 685 MAGOON</page><page sequence="36">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH mean to examinees who take these as tests has been the focus of several ethnomethodological studies (Cicourel et al., 1974; Me- han, 1973, 1974; Mehan et al., (Note 1). These studies depending in part on the analysis of examinees' own accounts generally raise troublesome questions regarding traditional measurement procedures; in particular, the validity of standardized test scores for minority group school children. Cicourel summarizes this point as follows: Our research shows that what could be called 'errors' in responding to standardized curricula and tests may be the result of misunderstanding on the part of teachers, testers, and children which are created by the interactional activities they are engaged in. Problems of attention, memory, dialect difference, incorrect guesses, and the like emerge in educa- tional interaction, but are not addressed as central ingre- dients of learning and evaluation that take place in the classroom. Treating errors and misunderstandings as natu- ral aspects of educational encounters would enable partici- pants to have access to them and become less preoccupied with a rigid notion of what is right and what is wrong. (p. 5-6) Cicourel finds that there are larger implications from these findings, and here he echoes many others (Hudson, 1972; Mes- sick, 1975; Kaplan, 1964; Scriven, 1972) that disciplines like the educational research and measurement community must come to realize that they view things from a particular vantage point, that this cannot be helped, but that it must be acknowledged and opened to both examination and other viewpoints. Put in the context of this essay, the measurement field has a particular constructed view of what is right and what is wrong on educa- tional tests, and this position requires rethinking. Conclusion There are a number of conclusions and implications that should be clarified, particularly the point that the "constructed worlds" of both the researcher and the observed human subjects need to be accounted for in many scientific explanations. This review indicates that constructed worlds of teachers and pupils have been studied by several workers utilizing a wide variety of ethnographic procedures, and are generally claimed to show that participants' constructions, such as roles played or rules fol- lowed, have a large effect on educational outcomes. A literature that is strongly supportive of this general approach is evident in writings about the philosophy of the social sciences, but at the same time very serious questions have come to be raised regard- 686 Vol. 47, No. 4</page><page sequence="37">CONSTRUCTIVIST RESEARCH ing the adequacy of the traditional approaches in educational research. The problems with present educational research procedures, goals, and methodology are everywhere, but rarely more clearly seen than in new teacher education problems. In a recent teacher education (PBTE), the present author found that such "innova- tive" programs were based in fact on time-honored assumptions underlying traditional behaviorist psychology (Magoon, 1976). Specifically, such programs insist that teacher behaviors should have a substantial effect on student behaviors (often defined as academic achievement). From a review of relevant literature it was concluded that this conception of teaching has yet to be validated against the behaviorist criterion, and that prototypical PBTE programs gloss over this flaw; i.e., a trainee's "perform- ance to criterion" is never taken to mean that the trainee has empirically demonstrated a general ability to change student behaviors. While PBTE advocates were found to assume that more experimental research on this problem would validate the PBTE concept of successful teaching, research reviews over the past two decades offer pessimistic conclusions on this point: Research on teacher behaviors which consistently affect student behaviors has had little or no success (Duncan &amp; Biddle, 1974). These findings were interpreted as indicative of serious imiscon- ceptions of the phenomenon being studied. New and broader conceptions of the teaching situation were seen to be required, and a general constructivist metaphor appeared to offer a viable alternative to present strategies. Construct validation is a scientific standard more honored in the breech than in practice among educational researchers. The inclusion of constructivist assumptions in educational research theory would not necessarily mark a radical break from tradi- tion, and could be the beginning of a systematic concern for constructs that both the scientists and the observed subjects hold. This is not an easy task. Constructions are not always something participants are particularly aware of; for example, such as intentions of teachers "to separate the wheat from the chaff' insofar as students are concerned (Rist, 1970; Sharp &amp; Green, 1975). Evidence for these structures needs to be carefully assembled and evaluated like any data. Educational researchers have somehow avoided serious examinations of constructs, most likely because the field was considered to be an "applied area" of psychology or sociology and the parent disciplines were seen as responsible for constructs. Educational researchers need to take constructions of participants and their own more or less implicit constructs very seriously if the discipline is to be reasonably comprehensive and self-critical as a scientific endeavor. Since values have a significant impact on what is seen by researchers, 687 MAGOON</page><page sequence="38">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH an attempt should always be made to articulate these as part of any research activity. In this regard a new standard may well be required, that of critical appraisal (cf., Adorno, 1976; Popper, 1972), which is a social science activity aimed at elucidating the social values that are implicit or explicit in various social re- search activities. Educational researchers appear to support high scientific standards and goals for their work and often ironically express doubts about the usefulness of mental notions such as con- structs. Constructions of the mind may often offer exceptionally good explanations for what is going on, the dyed-in-the-wool behaviorist educational researcher, for example, may assert, but is that of any scientific value insofar as prediction of behavior is concerned? One can simply respond by noting that an ethnog- rapher could predict quite well what such behaviorists would be looking for (i.e., linkages between behaviors) when scientifically analyzing teaching and learning, and the issue boils down to whether or not such a finding is valuable as a scientific state- ment. Predictions about precise individual behavior are one facet of explanation, but pattern explanations are equally legitimate and useful and may be a better scientific goal approximation for many purposes.
