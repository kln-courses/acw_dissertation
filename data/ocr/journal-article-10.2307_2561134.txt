<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANNALS of the Association of American Geographers Volume XXXII MARCH, 1942 No. 1 Environment, Village and City A Genetic Approach to Urban Geography; with Some Reference to Possibilism* GRIFFITH TAYLOR INTRODUCTION This is an outstanding year because it is marked by the complete econotic and military alliance of the United States and the British Empire. They are united in their determination not only to defeat enemy aggression, but also to root out evil developments based on what is false in the Totalitarian soci- ology. The international crisis makes me, as a Britisher, feel the more honoured to be chosen to present the annual address to this Assoc ation of American Geographers. The geographer studies environment. He believes that it is a vital factor in determining human progress. Some few of us who are willing to pro- claim ourselves as, in some measure, "tarred with the determinist brush," think that this has been true right through main's history. But the detailed study of environment, with the production of accurate maps and isopleth charts, is a comparatively recent plhase of research. Hence some of our sister disciplines, such as history and anthropology, are not yet willing to give mnuch time to its study, or indeed to grant the necessity for such study.1 The present writer has devoted a good deal of attention to the way in - Presidential address, delivered before the Association at New York, N.

As regards their earliest phases this research has great bearing onl the fundamentals of anthropology. I have ventured to produce a theory of racial evolution and classification which is making a good many converts among professional anthropologists. In the later phases the study of modern migrations is of course linked up with the development of pioneer lands.2 If we now turn to the smaller and perhaps more complex groups of man known as 'nationis, another set of problems arises, which may be included in the term Cultural Geography. The charting of national distributions and their relation to environment have given rise to a field of research midway between general geography and history, wihich the writer has found of great interest.3 Finally the still siiiallcr examples of human association are offered for our attention in the form of cities, towns, and villages. They are closely anchored to the envirolment, and this relation has been engaging my interest since I first becamlle associated with the original surveys for the projected capital of Australia, some thirty years ago. I believe that geographical tech- nicque will enable us to analyse the data connected with smaller human ag- glorneratiolls, and to develop Urban Geography as an orderly departmllent of our discipline. This should be of service to the sociologist and town planner; just as, I firmly believe, our techniques have already helped the anthropolo- gist and historian. Passing now to the third term in the title of my address, some explanation may seem to be necessary for introducing the determliinism-i-possilbilislml contro- versy into this study. It is precisely because I believe tthat manl has more "cchoice" of procedure as lhe is concerned 'vxith the details bf geographic study, that I am making the attempt to discriminate between the' two controls (en- vironmiental and human) in this approach to Urban Geography. I think that my objection to the possibilist is not because lhe seems often to be mainly on the lookout to see where man has exercised his powers over Nature, but because lhe rather tends to ignore the vastly greater importance of environ- mental control in most parts of the world. I have heard emlinent geogra- plhers apologise for using the termi. "cenvironnmental control"; and this, I confess, annoys me. I can make my point clearer perhaps by two exampleks drawn from lands which I have studied in detail: Australia and Antarctica. I would say that the most important geographical problem in Australia is to try to picture its population-pattern a century hence; and then to develop Australia in that 2En~vio.ironmctnt, Race, and Migrat[ion, Griffith Taylor.

The extreme possibIlist says that such a project is quite visiOn- arv, because man's plans and tools will change so greatly in the interval. I have studied developments in other, older parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia, and to mne it seems clear that the general population- pattern in the past has been determined almost exclusively by the environl- ment; and so it will be in the newer lands. In Antarctica I have no doubt that a few way-stations for aviators, and a few resorts for tourists, will develop there in the next century. These the possibilist will emphasize, as developing in spite of environment. But the determinist \vill say that such trivial details, in an icy area of five million square miles, are not worth mentioning in an attempt to evaluate environ- mental versus human control. Now these same principles hold in other better-endowed lands. The progress of settlement in North Amer-ica is in the main essentials due to environmental control; and we ought (as the chief interpreters of enlviroll- ment) to stress this fact. Where does the possibilist come in? As I see it, lhe is the short-range geographer, whereas the environmentalist takes a longer view. Nature needs centuries for her influences to work properly. In mlOSt major geographical problems there is one best 'wiay to do things, and of course a dozen less satisfactory ways which man can "choose." Usually man (and in this lhe is, in a sense, supported by the possibilist) endeavours to proceed by the long-established mnethod of trial and error. He chooses one possible way and theen another and finally adopts the one best suited to the environ- ment. It is true that at times it is difficult to say whlJiclh is the "best way,'l but the environmentalist is always del)ating the matter. We may use the sugar industry in northeast Australia as an illustration of the difference in views. The possibilist points out that mlan has chosen to grow sugar in this region, even though it can be purchased for half th e price in the foreign market. The long-range environmentalist would say that Australia has not yet arrived at the stage wvlhere sugar should be growv 1 in her tropics. Australia is a pioneer country with a small population ; and should at present concentrate on industries which require less costly laboour. Even if he grants that the WVhite Australia policy is worth some sacrifice, it is the geographer's duty, as I see it, to point out wherein man is departing from the logical o-de)r of material development. We see here why most economists and technologists dislike the determinist idea. They are "short-range" developers; and none the less valuable teachers because that is their province. But the geogra- pher, in my opinion, should look much farther ahead. He should try to find the best plan among those possible. Exaggerating somiewhat, I feel that man's part in the programme of a country's evolution is not unlike that of a traffic policeman. In nline-tentlhs of the wvorld-but</page><page sequence="4">4 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar. not so definitely in the much restricted better-endowed parts of the world-a "Stop-and-Go Determinism" seems the logical ideology for the geographer. Nature determines the route, man can only control the rate of progress.' Let us now return to the topics which formh the main purpose of this address. Though Urban Geography is a rather new development, there is already a considerable literature onl the subject. However I propose in this address to discuss certain aspects of the growtvh of villages, towns, and cities which I have investigated during mly rather wide experience as a wanldering geographer. It is difficult to decide wvhere the geographical observer should set llis professional limi-its. The choice of the site of the young settlement is largely controlled by the environment. So also is its subsequent growth, excluding perhaps the pattern of the streets. The form and construction of the houses depend largely on the environment (e.g., the climate) and on the materials available. But admittedly many of the aspects of a town are due to human choice, and seem to have little to do wvith the local environment. In these aspects this geographer has less interest. Sometimes, indeed, the city seems to develop in defiance of the environment; and this has led to waste and unnecessary expense, as I hope to show later. Several aspects of town development have not been as fully discussed as they might be by geographers. These, as well as some more familiar prob- lems, I hope to lay before you in soniewvhat the following order: a. Some variations of towns with latitude. 1b. The city made to plan, e.g., Canberra. c. The city as controlled by geological structure, e.g., Sydney. d. Stages in the development of a city, e.g., Toronto. e. The "Zones and Strata" concept as applied to towns (Port Credit &amp; Whit by). f. The classification of towns, and their description by formulae. g.

SECTION A SEVEN EXAMPLES OF SETTLEMENTS FROM TYPICAL LATITUDES In this address I do not hope to do more than draw attention to the vari- ous aspects of human clusters which should be of interest in a genuine geo- graphical approach. As a parallel I may cite the botanist, who does not need to knoxv every unimportant detail about a plant in order to classify it, and to place it in its proper category. Or to comle nearer home, K6ppen has produced a workable classification of the innumerable variations in the 4Presidential Address to the British Geographers (B.A.A.S.), Griffith Taylor.

We have first to answ"Ter the question, That are the main elements in the orowth of a hulaman cluster, wvhether in its early or its late stages? I have therefore thought that it would be of interest to describe briefly a number of towns and settlements which I have investigated in very differ- ent parts of the world. Plans of each are illustrated, and some indications of the surrounding region and of its influence on the agglomeration is givenl. Iln several recent memoirs I have adopted the "traverse" p)lan of studly. Thus in the northern Sahara I described15 the changes as one journeyed fromt the xvet coast to the southern desert. Later, in studying the main principles of the Australian settlement in my recent book,3 I made a similar studv and iuvestigated conditions at (qial (listfllcs across the continent. As regards the present study dealing with towns in general, we all know that latittide is the chief variable which affects settlement. Hence the first part of this address considers seven settlements on a traverse from the Poles to the Equator approximately 10O of latitude apart, each in a different continent. Furthermore it will be of interest to try ald decide the respective impor- tances of the environment and the human factor in these type examples. No accurate evaluation is possible, but the writer (who is somewhat of a (le- termiuist in the broader fields of racial and national distril)ution) is prepared to admit that the hutiman factor becomes of increasingly greater importance as we consider smaller and smaller hutiman agglomerations in otur research. The following table shows some of the main characters of the seven samples chosen.

Cape Evaiis, a settlciiiciit on the Antarctic ice cap We may learn a good deal as to the role of an adverse environment in the development of a settlement, by considering the first attempts to live in Antarctica. No doubt one of the little coal towns in Spitsbergen (such as Longyear City) wonldl be m-ore informative, bnt the sole experience of the writer has been gained on the west coast of Ross Island in latitnce 770 30' Sonth.

Hence Ross Island in the Ross Sea offered the best site for exploration, and for extending in this unique environment our knowledge of meteorology, magnetism, glacial erosion, geology, plaiit and animlal ecol- ogy, etc. Secondly, why was Cape Evans chosen rather thkav- any, other site? Here we have one of the best examples of enviroma-yiettal control known to the writer. Every explorer wished to land his stores at the most southern spol- available, as car/v in the stummer season as possible. Hence the huts were invariably erected at the edge of the open sea, wivhen the boats reached Ross</page><page sequence="8">S TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mlar. Island early in January.

On Scott's second expedition, in which the writer was senior geologist we found thick bay-ice south of Cape Evans on the 4th of Januar-y. This fixed the site of the hut at Caje Evans (Photo 2). The southern parties were able to reach the Ross Ice Shelf as late as the 24th of January, buit in a few days open water separated the hut fromt the Ice Shelf. It is of interest that our sledging parties returning fromt the soutlh were unable to return to our own hut at Cape Evans until the 13th of April. In the meantime we lived in the communal settlement at Hut Point (Photo 1). Two years later two men were drowned on this short crossing of 14 miles, because theey tried to traverse the sea ice to Cape Evans before the new ice was thlick enotugh. In the map (Fig. 2) I have added actual dates in 1911 when the sea froze near Hut Point, and when the ice broke away near Cape Evans. Such then Aw-as the uniland of Cape Evans. To the east extended uninter- rupted ice slopes to the summit of Erebus at 13,000 feet. In places fields of cre-vasses prevented any crossing of the land ice; and of course the le-vel sea- ice was far preferable for sledgillg except in the season when it was liable to break away under one (in the summer). The third question to answer is "What kind of a settlement developed on the chosen site ?" I have ventured to talk of Cape Evans as a "communal hamalet"; since it reminds one of the similar settlements in Jugoslavia in the late middle ages. (Still better would the term apply to the more complex lhamlet at Little America.) The main hut (Fig. 2) had a floor area of 50 feet 1)Y 25 feet, and a simple roof with a central ridge. Three small windows, permanently shut and with doubled panes, admitted sufficient ligh1t ill the stummer, while in the lonug winter an acetylene plant in the porch gave us liglt. Of considerable interest were the preQautions to keep out the cold. In addition to five layers of wood and packing forming the walls, the hut was protected by side-sheds. These two annexes are clearly shownl in the plan (Fig. 2). On the west the stables were built of compressed coal hlile oln the east an enclosed verandah was built of boxes of food, etc. To serve the varied needs of the 25 settlers there were smaller btildinngs in the vicinity such as the magnetic hut and the ice grottoes for storing food (and for pendulum work). There was also a great store of compressed chaff for the support of the ponies; wvhile the dog kennels formed a livel faltboliry to the south. At the end of the second w inter the southeast blizzards had covered everythilng, so that the hut was almost invisible.

Outside the average temperature for July was around - 200 F. If we use the analogy of living organisms in connection with this study of town development, then the hamlet just considered may be likened to an extremely simple animal consisting of only one cell. All functions are carried on in this cell, and no "zones" are present. It represents the simplest of lhunan clusters, and is clearly in the infantile stage of town development. A few further notes on the environment may be added. The normal sledging- season extends from about September 20th to March 20th. In these latitudes (77-? S.) the sun vanished about April 22nd and returned on August 22nd. However the great cold and the almost constant blizzards made March and September very unpleasant for such sledging as had to be done. No vegetation (except rare moss and lichen) is found in the whole continent, so that no animals can live on the land. Practically all the food (except seal meat) had to be brought from civilised lands. The density of human settlement under these conditions is too low to be charted. It may be noted that the nearest similar temporary settlement was the hut 400 miles north at Cape Adare; while Framheim-1 (Little America) was about the same distance to the east. As far as the Antarctic continent is concerned, the geographer can say that the environment is supreme. Man (in the form of explorers and scientists) may choose to inhabit certain minute clots therein temporarily and at great expense, but the writer sees no argu- Ilent in favour of Possibilism in our first example. 2. Bergchi, a large tozcit i' tale cool te;tperatc Portion of Europe As noted earlier, our examples are to be taken at average intervals of 10 degrees of latitude. Hence our second example is in a cool temperate climate, but is not typical thereof; since the coast of Norway has the highest winter anomaly in the world. However it is an extremely interesting town, for a variety of reasons. Owing to its position on the northwest of Europe it experiences almost constant, warmi, moist, southwest winds. These pro- dluce a typical marine climate (Cfb, as shown in Fig. 1), with a heavy rain- fall and a very mild winter. In addition to the unusual climate, Bergen has an unusual topography. Owing to the epeirogenic uplift of the Caledonian Folds in Norway during late Tertiary times, the hinterland of Bergen is a plateau of about 4000 feet elevation. The Caledonian folding took the form of a series of parallel arcs, whose anatomy is clearly visible in the topography today, for the uplift con- sisted of alternating strips of. hard granitic material and of softer Silurian schists. Erosion since the uplift, whether by water or ice, has removed the softer schists much more quickly than the harder eruptive rocks, and these</page><page sequence="11">1942] BERGEN, NORWAY 11 "Bergen Arcs" (crossed by what seem to be tension cracks) account for the regular valleys and gulfs which have in large part determined the site of Bergen (See the inset in Fig. 3).

"Why did folks settle at Bergen in the first place?" We may safely assume that it was but one of numerous sites used by the early Viking seamen. In the soft silts at the north side of the By Fiord, they dragged their boats ashore near the Sandvik of today (Fig. 3). In the early days Lungegaard Lake was connected to Vaagen Bay; while two morainic ridges separated Vaagen from Pudcle Fiord. The town was founded near the present Bergenhus (No. 2 in the plan) about 1075 ; and in later times several forts were built hereabouts to protect the harbour. The Danish King Canute controlled Britain, Denmark, and Norway; and he placed his capital at Bergen; which lay midway between Edinborough, Opslo (Oslo), and Nidaros (Trondheim). The name Bergen is derived</page><page sequence="12">12 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar. from Berg-vin, i.e., mountain meadows, and refers to the abundant grass on the slopes of the By Fiord. During the, 12th century English traders were gradually replaced by Germans belonging to the Hanseatic League. During the next few centuries they built large warehouses all along the north side of the Vaagen, which is called Tydske-brygge (i.e., Deutsch Quay) to this dav. About 1600 the power of the Hansa declined, and trade had all passed into Norwegian hands by 1750. Before examining further the growth of Bergen it may be well to point out that it is the most northern city containing 100,000 people. This is the more remarkable since it is not a capital city, having been replaced by Oslo several centuries ago. (Helsinki, Stockholm, and Leningrad are all further south.) Nor has it any fertile hinterland, as is obvious front the inset map. We may safely say that its advantageous position in respect to the fishing grounds, and to the trade of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, led to its very considerable expansion. As the map shows, it is protected from storms by the "skerry guard" of the low Sartor Isles. Areas of farm-land on the floors of the numerous glacier-cut troughs are relatively large to the south- east of Bergen. Especially after the Bergen-Oslo Railway was built in 1900 did the city grow vigorously. Fish at first, and later ship-building and an entrepot trade in grain, wool, and petrol, account for Bergen's prosperity. It is still the chief trading port for Norway. Reference to the main map in Figure 3 shows that Bergen was confined to the east side of Vaagen until 1300. This was the Hanseatic centre, per- lhaps at its maximum about 1500. Then the swampy land at the head of Vaagen was gradually covered with streets and houses. The present shop- ping and office centre is along the Torv (market) and Strand streets. Here also is one of the largest fish markets in the world. By 1750 the area between Vaagen and Lungegaard was all occupied by buildings (Photo 3). Bergen has been the scene of manly fires, one of the worst occurring in the district around the Pool in 1916, but this area has all been covered with large stone buildings since that date. Modern suburbs have spread round Pudde Fiord and Lungegaard. Various factories, mostly connected with ships or fish, have sprung up in outlying areas like Laksevaag or Sandvik. The steep sides of the hills, Floi-Fell (900 feet) on the east, and Lovstaken (1500 feet) on the southwest, have prevented the city front spreading far from the original site around Vaagen. We can clearly see the part played by topography and climate in the growth of a town as large as Bergen in this high latitude; the same as that of South Greenland, north Labrador and the Bering Sea. Yet many cul- tural factors are of course present. Bergen was an early centre of religious and political power, and these are man-made factors. Water-power, fish- eries, tourist trade, and railways depend partly on physical, partly on cultural</page><page sequence="13">1942] BERGEN, NORWAY 13 T. _, PHOTO 3.-The WVharf at Bergen, once occupied by the Hansa merchants. The harbour (Vaagen) lies to the left (Courtesy of Robert S. Platt.) conditions. A determinist will stress the former and say that water-power depends primarily on topography and rainfall, fisheries depend on the tem- perature and food conditions in the sea. Tourism flourishes where Nature has displayed her choicest scenery. Railways must go where the natural corridors are easiest. Man can choose one of an infinite number of ways of exploiting a country; but it seems to the writer that our "chooser" rather resembles the so-called "yes-man." If he is to prosper, he does well to choose what Dame Nature the Dictator indicates is the best for him!! My visit to Bergen in 1931 was too short for me to make a functional survey of the town; and so far as I know this is not available. Many of the historic data in my main map are based on H. Slanar (Proc. Geog. Soc., Vienna, 1918). It is obvious that the city exhibits the usual plan; with the business centre near the Torv, and with more or less concentric zones of offices, apartments, and villas to the south. These zones are somewhat horse- shoe shaped (rather than circular), in accord with the unusually hilly topography of the site. 3. McMurray, a fur-trading river port in North America In 1778 Peter Pond explored the region north of Lake Athabasca, and about 1790 the Northwest Company established a fur-trading station at McMurray on the Athabasca River (Fig. 4 at A). It was situated on the man corridor of canoe-travel from the Great Lakes to the Mackenzie River. Canoes reached Lake Winnipeg vta the Lake of the Woods. Thence they</page><page sequence="14">14 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar. f,0 \Ch 7. -4&lt; f re sh / ? e/ lip zh ~~~ s/ ~ ~ H o FIG. 4.-Settlement conditions inl the Taiga of north Canada.

At the hiead of this stream the Frog Poi-tage led to the Chlurchlill Rivler which rises in La Loche lake. At the north end of</page><page sequence="15">1942] MCMURRAY, ALBERTA 15 the latter was the famous La Loche Portage where M\1ethye Fort was built (Fig. 4). A rough wagon road of 12{ miles was constructed here in 1875, so that heavy goods could be placed on the Clearwater River. McMurray, the settlenment under discussion, grew up 40 miles west of the portage at the junction of the Clearwater with the mighty Athabasca River. The waters of the latter, after passing through Lake Athabasca and Great Slave Lake, reach the Mackenzie River. The first steamer traversed the Mackenzie from Fort Smith Rapids in 1887, while in 1920 the railway fromli Edmonton reached Waterways on the Clearwater. Today the train traverses thle Taiga north of Edmonton once a week, and I made my survey in July, 1936. At Lac La Biche (132 nmiles north) is the last of the farming country, though small patches of crops are grown right to the Arctic Circle. The chief inhabitants north of Lac La Biche are Cree Indians, engaged in trap ping and fishing. The little towns, marked hereabouts on the map, usually contain fewer than half a dozen houses. It is therefore somewhat of a surprise to find that there are two towns at the end of the railway. These are Waterways and McMurray (Fig. 4 at B). Possibly it was intended to carry the railway beyond Waterways to the older settlenment of McMurray. But deep water is available in the Clearwater; while rather high prices were demanded for the necessary lands at Mc- Murray, so that there seenms no likelihood of the railway being extended at present over the intervening three miles. Waterways controls the railway traffic, and here the loading of the steamers and scowNs for the northern country takes place. McMurray is still the centre for the local fur-trade, and for the growing air-borne traffic to the mlinaing fields of the north. There is little doubt in the writer's miind that this "twin settlement" is destined to grow rapidly in the next few decades. Hence it seems of impor- tance to learn just how the town has progressed in the years since the railway arrived. One must confess that Waterways shows no evidence of any design whatever (Fig. 4 at C). The railway curves round the station in a loop which serves the huge storage sheds of the Hudson Bay and Northern Transport Companies. The offices of the Companies are naturally close to these sheds. A large oil depot is between the two (Photo 6). Five smiall steamer-scow units link Waterways to the portage at Fort Smith. The river is open from mid-May to mlid-October. There are a dozen wooden houses, maostly little mllore than frame shacks, scattered in the vicinity. A few lundred yards from the station is the com- blined hotel and store-a miore elaborate two-storey buildinlgf-which is the natural centre for Waterways. Water for the hotel is obtained fromt the village pump across the street. One other smaller store is nearby.

Perhaps one reason for the lack of plan is the possibility of floods. In the spring and autumn the northern parts of the rivers are frozen, while the southern waters are still pouring their supply northwards. Hence wide- spread floods occur at times, which drown the houses of Waterways in several feet of water. Back of the settlement (Fig. 4) are rounded hills rising 300 feet above the river. These are clothed in a regular jungle of conifers and aspens. Natural clearings with considerable areas of pasture occur in places, and one such grassy meadows was grazed by the cattle of the early fur traders (about one mile east of 'Mc'Murray) in the district now called Prairie (Fig. 4 at B). For a settlement 140 years old Mic'Murrav is not very imposing. There is the straight main street about a mile long. which runs west to the junction of the two rivers (Fig. 4 at D). All the houses are shown in this large-scale map; and they are almost all frame houses and one storev high, though the shops often have a false two-storev front. However the Hudson Bay Store and the chief hotel are more imposing buildings, and most of them were neat and freshly painted. Indeed the school and churches are quite attractive buildings (Photo 4). PHo~ro 4.-The main street of McMurray (Alberta) looking to the west. The large building on the left is the Hotel, the Hudson Bay Store is four buildings to the west. In addition to the big Company store there were three other stores, three cafes. two butchers, two barbers, and a drug store. The Bank, Post Office, and Dance Hall are in the shopping block.

The frame building is typical of this pioneer settlement, and was transferred here from a former rail terminus. The site of Mfc'furrav is clearly determined by the junction of the two streams of canoe traffic via the Athabasca and La Loche. The steamer port was placed here because of the rapids in the Athabasca just above MIcMurrav. The next similar steamer port is at Fort Smith Rapids, about 230 miles to the north. But the railway is unlikely to be extended to Fort Smith since air traffic is already reducing the importance of steamers and railways in the empty northlands. Apart from its junction-position below the rapids. Mc- Murray seems to offer no advantage over a dozen other sites in northern central Canada. But this definite environmental factor has given it a small lead, enough to make it the railway terminus and air-port. Cannot we agree again that man has "chosen." out of many "possible" sites, that which Nature had already marked out as the best?' 4. Pekin, a delta cita' in the temperate zone of Asia Pekin offers a fair example of a large city which has developed under temperate conditions in a gigantic deltaic plain. It is larger, older, and much more complex in its evolution than any of the other examples, so that it represents the other extreme in our study from the settlement at Cape Evans.</page><page sequence="19">1942] PEKIN, CHINA 19 Yet we must try to answer our fundamental questions just the same. It is difficult to point to any environmental factor which has led to Pekin's dlomi- nance over mlost of the towns in the deltaic deposits of the Hoang-Ho. These cover an area of about 80,000 square miles; for though the plain extends south to Shanghai the southern portion (containing this city and Nanking) does not derive fromt the Hoalig-Ho. One would have expected the chief northern city to lhave developed either in the centre of the plain, or near the main river, or possibly at a good harbour on the coast.. Pekin fulfils none of these conditions. Iln early historic days the capital of China was undoubtedly in Shensi. About the time of Christ it was moved east to Honan, and about A.D. 317 to the coastal province of Kiang-su. For a time around 960 it was placed at Kaifeng, which has a central position on the great river. However in the 12th century the Kin tribes of the north made Chung-tu their capital and this town occupies the site later known as the Chinese section of Pekin (Fig. 5).

It seemns clear that a considerable "human" element is involved in the choice of the site of Pekin. In early days necromancers ascribed to the site a peculiarlv fortunate character.

In the latter the streets are broader and the buildings larger and much more imposing.

They are enclosed ill high vrivate walls which enabled them to withstand the Boxer rebels ill 1900. A stream formerly. crossed the Tatar city fromt North to South; and this has given rise to a number of ornamental lakes, which beatutifyr the palace grounds of the Imperial City. The latter is enclosed in the centre of the Tatar city, and ill turn it protects the Forbiddena City where the Emperors spent most of their lives. In the northern part of the Imperial City is a small hill 200 feet high called Coal Hill. It is crowned by several small temples, and contrasts with the surrounding plains; but this "eillillence is undoubtedly artificial ill origin. The Tatar City is covered with buildings, streets and palaces; and though many Manchus still live here, the majority of the people are nlO Chinese. It is difficult to chart functional zones for this city, fcor the alnc'ent and modern plans are somewlhat at variance. Originally the emperor s palaces and house- hold occupied the Forbidden City. The government officials lived in the Imperial City, the ruling caste of Manchus in the Tatar City, wlile the sub- ject groups of Chinese xere ill the adjacent but separate Chinese Ctyv. To- clay the palaces are larg ely nmisetums, while the governmelnt offices are iiiostly scattered through the southern half of the Tatar City, though some are still ill the Imperial City. Probably the huge walls will be levelled in the near future, and the space converted into wide boulevards awl gardens. It may be noted that though large areas of the Chinese City are empty, yet there are a few small "suburbs" outside the walls especially to the east of the Tatar City. A glance at the map of China shows that there is no other large city in North China near to Pekin, except Tientsin. The magical and political fac- tors (briefly referred to earlier) led to the city's birth, perhaps as far back as 723 B.C. At this timre Chli" was the capital of the Yen kingdom, accord- ing to the Enicyclopedia Si1iica (Fig. 5). Giveln this start no other city seems to have arisen to compete with it, though other sites such as Kaifeng would seem to have more to recommend them. In process of time the main roads inevitably led to Pekin, and six of these Imperial Roads (A to F) are shown ill Figure 5. Later the four main railways also radiated fromt Pekin, respectively to Mukclen, Paotu, Canton and Shanghai. In latitude and origin Pekin reminds one of Madrid, but the climate is rather different. There is a hot, wet sutmmer and a verv cold, dry winter.</page><page sequence="22">22 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [ Mar. Owing to its eastern position in the huge land-mass of Asia Pekin has a rather extreme climate, as is clearly shown by the hythergraph in Figure 1. The long extension of the graph to the right (in summer) indicates a marked rainy season, so that the graph for Pekin is fairly typical of Monsoon con- ditions. The present plan of Pekin is essentially oriental acd medieval. But an enclave of occidental culture is being incorporated in it, especially in the southern part of the Tatar City. We may perhaps compare this enclave to the neotechnic sections developing in certain parts of an occidental city. (I returin to this concept later when discussing the plans and growth of Trento.) The palaces clearly form the nucleus of Pekin, even though today no emperor lives there. Around them is an administrative zone, and beyond that the upper-class town of the Tatar City. Smaller slhops and slum areas are rather characteristic of the separate southern qluarter called, the Chinese City. I shall not try later on to give a formula for Pekin; but may remark that we are here confronted with an example of city structure as complex as some of those composite iuiilcrals, whose chemistry almost dlefies the formula-mi-aker. Luckily few towns are so complex. It must be admitted that the choice of the site of Pekin is not clue to any marked environmental factors. Obviously in such a rich agricultural region as the Hoang-Ho delta, some large distributing centres were bound to de- velop, but they are less characteristic of a primitive oriental culture than of a modern industrial occidental culture. We may perhaps grant that Pekin- situated in a vast region of tunifor111 environmient-iS a good example to sug- gest that the possibilist theory does, uinder such conditions, explain the facts of geographical distribution. 5. Bisk ra, a desert towzen in the 11iloditerran(c'11ean regionl In 1938 I was able to carry out a life-long plan to compare the Sahara Desert with the arid areas of Australia. While the environmnents are alike, there is naturally very little resemblance in the human settlements. This may, at first sight, be taken as a triutmplh for the Possibilist Party. I am of the opinion, however, that the dissimilarities in the two types of settle- ment are merely due to the different stages of development obtaining in Algeria and Australia. Let us compare Coward Springs in Australia (450 miles northwest of Adelaide) witlh Biskra. Both lie on the edge of the desert, and have a winter rainfall of 4 inches. The covering of sparse but regular vegetation in each case is similar in pattern though not in genera. Both, curiously enough, are situated on the edges of artesian basins. Both. have railways, which have been running for many years, in the case of Coward Springs</page><page sequence="23">1942] BISKRA, ALGERIA 23 since 1890. When I visited Coward Springs in 1919 it was the chief settle- ment on the railway for 50 miles in either direction.

(Given an (ceil-clit environment, stuch as at Chicago, a settlement might add a million to its population in thle samire period.) Let us now see what has happened iii the Sahara with a far lower standard of living and a far greater population pressure. In spite of an equally unfavourable environment, Biskra is an apparently flourishing tonwl witlh about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom 2000 are French (Fig. 6).

The little river Tilatou runs south from the interior plateau to the marginal range, and thence through the gorge at El Kantara to the Sahara. At this settlement wheat is grown on little hill-fans just north of the gorge; while south of it in or near the stream-bed is a large date oasis which sup- ports 6000 Arabs. From El Kantara the water (in winter) flows south for miles into the veritable desert and reaches Biskra (Photo 8). Thence PHOTO 8.-The palm Oasis of Biskra in the Sahara, showing the water from the Atlas fountains which irrigates the Date Palms. it flows south, and, at times, reaches the salt playa called Shott Meirir, which is below sea level.

A rectangular arrangement of streets, with the main axis running N.W.-S.E., extends for half a mile between the station and the group of large hotels in the south- east. The centre of the town contains the Town Hall and Post Office, while barracks are to be found near the wadi to the east. But the most note- worthy feature of the town is the large Fort- (400 by 200 yards) which defends the town on the north. This is surrounded by stout brick walls about 20 feet high, and guarded by towers with slots for rifles. Inside this wall are the military offices, hospitals, as well as many small houses for officers, etc. (Photo 9). At the extreme southeast corner of Biskra is I_ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1r PHOTrO 9.-The walls of Biskra, with a flock of goats brought in from the environs. A tower of the French Fort appears in the background. the small "negro village," though the dwellers seemed to be of Arab rather than negro origin. A large and roughly circular area of date plantations extends for nearly 2 miles to the south of the town. The houses are built of brick or of irregular stones covered with stucco and painted white. In the town both the French and Arab quarters contain two-storey houses, but in the lower-class houses in the quarter south of the main town, the characteristic high Arab walls enclosed small yards on to which various flat-roofed rooms opened. A crowded open market, as well as a mosque, are typical buildings in the Arab portion of the town. Biskra is-the terminus of a light railway which runs south to Touggourt, and collects the date harvest for export from the Sahara (Fig. 6). Possi-</page><page sequence="26">26 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [ Mlar. bly foreigners imiagine that many stuch railways may run south into the rainless desert in the future. But it is the artesian water which makes possible the string of oases to the south of Biskra; and so far as I know there is no other locality in the French Sahara so well endowed. In pre- historic times the rains on the Ahaggar Plateau gave rise to the large river Igharghar, which flowed north to Touggourt. Probably today some of the scantv waters flow far to the north along relatively deep-seated permeable beds, and replenish the artesian basin under Touggourt. No doubt waters from the Atlas mountains also reach this basinl. The city-plan of Biskra shows us a fort in the north with a park belt and a zone of offices just to the south. The latter lies in the centre of a belt of better-class French houses. Still farther south is another zone of second- class houses , while yet south again is a belt of smaller oriental Arab houses. How does Biskra fit into our determinist-possibilist debate? When we think of the enormous length of the northern border of the desert, which extends about 2500 miles from the Waadi Draa to Suez in the east, it is clear that only a few districts are as favoured as Biskra. There is only one by- gone Igharghar River, and probably no equal to the Touggourt artesian area. Figuig and Laghouat are similar desert outposts, but only the former is served by a desert railway. - Hence I should make use of our Biskra example as follows: Given desert conditiolls such as obtain in- the Sahara there are only a very few sites where the am-ieliorating factors have justified modern enter- prise in developing the district as the French have developed Biskra. Even the military site was strictly determined by the water and the traffic condi- tions. We may note that these were also in operation in Romian times, centuries before the French took over Algeria. As usual I see Nature (i.e., the environm-ient) acting as the dictator far more than man in the settlement problem under these difficult conlditi ons. The possibilist, it seems to me, puts the cart before the horse. He would say "Ah, but the vital trade in dates owes iniuch to the artesian bores and to the desert railway; and surely these are due to human energy ?' The determinist replies "Man can put down bores and build railways anywhere in the Sahara; but in the vast majority of cases lhe takes very good care to do so only where Nature has provided the conditions to make such expenditure worth while." In such exploitation Nature determines the route of development, m1an only determines its rate. To returns to the parallel with Coward Springs in Australia. I see no sign of man utilising this southern region yet. But when population pressure has increased to som-iething like that present in Algeria, then we shall find man in Australia using the methods of develop-</page><page sequence="27">1942] URANDANJI, QUEENSLAND 27 ment which Nature has driven man to use in the same environm-lent at Biskra. \XWe may illustrate this phenomenon of population-pressure by compar- ing the population densities in three regions, each of which has much the same environment. They are western Spain, Algeria and southern Australia. All have a Mediterranean climate with similar and pleasant temperature conditions on the whole. In all three regions the rainfall diminishes in the interior. It is obvious that crop-densities (and therefore populations) depend primarily on rainfall. Iii the graph inset in Figure 1 the relation is expressed approximately bly a straight line for each of these regions. Spain and Algeria exhibit very similar conditions; and, to the writer, this indicates that the population- pressure is about the same in each. Southern Australia shows a much lower density of population for the same rainfall. At a rough approximation, this seems to indicate that the population pressure in Spain and Algeria is about eight times as great as in southern Australia. The natural result is that standards of living are far higher in Australia. But it is entirely probable that population pressure in Australia will increase considerably as time goes on. Later on, the graph-line for Australia will climb to a position much closer to those for Spain and Algeria. The difference is not really clue to human choice, but to the 11i1111itulrc character of Australian settlement. 6. Urandaiji, a scemi-dcsert liamIilct iii t[le cast of tropicmal Alstr(alia(l For my sixth sample I have chosen a tiny village on the pioneer fringe of Australia, of which I made a sketch survey when I was investigating the rival trans-continental railways in 1922. Uranclanji, tiny as it is, appears on most maps of Australia for it is the sole settlement in that part of Queens- land. Camooweal is 120 miles north, while Boulia is the same distance' to the south. Soinewvhat nearer are the mines at Dajarra and Duchess on the railway to Townsville. The striking feature about Uranclanji's position however is that there is no town to the westward for 1200 ulcs, until one reaches Marble Bar not far front the Indian Ocean. It is true that there are a few large cattle ranches near Barrow Creek (Fig. 7) but hardly a score of white folk inhabit these areas of sparse pastoral occupation. They are indicated as white patches in the uninhabited portions of tropical Aus- tralia which are shown b)y close ruling. What sort of a settlement has grown up in this pioneer region of Aus- tralia during the fifty years or so of its pastoral development ? With a total rainfall of only 11.4 inches, and an average temperature of 740 F., one could not expect much of a humian agglomeration, especially as the evaporation is not far from 120 inches a year.</page><page sequence="28">28 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [ Mar. One day in August 1922 we motored west across the rather rough land- scape between the railway at Duchess and Uranldanji. We passed two ranches in which the usual bare iron buildings (raised on wooden piles to combat white ants) rather repel the traveller who comes fromt more favoured districts. Some 20 mailes fromt Duchess we clim-ibed up a stony pass amid giant ant-nests and clumps of desert spinifex grass (Triodia). West of this range the rock outcrops changed fromt sandstone to shale, witth an immediate improvement in the grazing capacity. In these plains the soil is often a red gravelly clay and carries sparse Mitchell Grass. Wild bustards and large kangaroos were occasionally seen. The little township lies 150 miles on the hot side of the Tropic of Capricorn. It consisted (in 1922) of aii hotel, two stores, the post office and a few other houses disposed on each side of the broad 1mnain street. (Fig. 7).

Iron roofs and verandahs are universal. The most prominent features were half a dozen iron windmills, which pump up river soakage from wells some 50 feet deep. Though no large trees grow in the township, yet there are some fine hedges of acacia; and two or three of the gardens contained beautiful rose- trees. The Georgina River rises north of Camooweal, and after a course of 200 miles passes close to Urandanji. In times of flood the river may be several miles wide, but on my visit hardly any rain had fallen for the last six months (Photo 10). However there was a fine pool in the river, about half a mile long, near the township, which indeed owed its position partly to this Vital factor. the river. PHOTO 10.-The Georgina River which flows through Urandanji in the west of Queensland. The rainfall is about 10 inches here, but large waterholes persist for many months in some parts of the river. Further up the river in Northern Territory is Lake Nash (Fig. 7). It is the only permanent water available to the wild blacks in a dry season. and accordingly they tend to congregate here each November. A large cat- tle station has been established at Lake Nash, to the west of which is the Arunta Desert. We may sum up by stating that under the environmental conditions cited, with cattle ranches about 20 miles apart, a little town such as Urandanji has developed about half way between Camooweal and Boulia, i.e., 120 miles from either. The hamlet is on the great stock-route of cattle travelling from Northern Territory and Camooweal to the South Australian Railway at Marree. Some day Urandanji may be on or</page><page sequence="30">30 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GE'qOGRAPHY [i Mar. close to the logical transcontinental railway, which will ililnk Darwin to the populous country in the southeast of the continent. It is worth noting that the Uranldanji district is a homoclime of much of the Darfur, Chad, and Middle Niger regions in Africa. These receive about 11 inches of suimmer rain, ald this is sufficient to enalble hundreds of small towns to develop in Africa. The average population density in the African belt is about 6 per square mile. In Australia it is about one-eighth of a person per square mile for similar environments. The writer does not agree that this illustrates "human choice," i.e., that 50 folk choose to live in Darfur for one who chooses to live in Westeri QOueensland. It is merely another example of the stages of development in man's occupation of a specific environment. In a pioneer country, with no population pressure and with high stan dards of living, we find an early stage with a density of only one-eighth. Under the competitive conchtions o)taini'ng in the Sudan. six folk per sqcuare mile can be supported at a very low standard of living. Thougffh it is highly unlikely that Urandanji will ever reach this hligh density ; its population may advance considerably as pressure increases in the rest of Australia. However, a local resident (Mr. V. Bye) writes me in 1941 that only two more houses have been built in Uranldanji in the last twenty years, while one original house has been burnt down and one store closed. Hence man has not exercised his powers of choice very noticeably as regards this possiible site. 7. Santa. Marta-a tropical monsoon0 tozew i11 Somth Aiiierica For my last example I have chosen a sea-level town only 11 degrees from the Ecluator. Here with an average monthly temperature of 81.50 F. we find a fairly typical tropical settlement, even though the rainfall of 43 inches is rather small for such a low latitude. Santa Marta in Colombia is the most northern large town in South America. Moreover it lies south- west of the first settlement made in 1493 by Columbus in Santo Domingo. Since the constant trade-winds would drive the early Spanish ships south- ward to Santa Marta, it is not surprising that Ojeda 1)uilt a fortress here in 1502, possibly before the foundation of Nombre de Dios in Panamla. Thus our seventh example is in a sense the oldest settlement in North or South America. The town however was not properly established until 1525. My survey was made in December 1930, when I made several short journeys into the Andes, which here reach their most northern position.S A rocky cape projects like a hook to the southwvest, and so affords ample S "Settlemient Zones in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia," Griffith Taylor, Gcog.

According to E. R. Tirado, towards the end of the 16th century the town already contained six of the present rectangular streets and a church in what is now the southeast of the town. It was however almost moribund by 1882, when the railway to the interior was begun. Today its prosperity depends almost wholly on the banana trade, which is most efficiently directed by the Amenrican colony connected with the United Fruit Company of Boston. As regards the town itself it is built on the flat plain north of the little Manzanares River. The town, sheltered from the trade winds, is muggy and hot.

There are four types of l)uikl- ings, which tooether constitute practically the whole of the town. These are arranoged ill definite zones, and are plotted ill Figure 9. The foreign bnsi- ness is chiefly ill the west, and the local business in the centre. The poorer people live chiefly ill the east. One-storey bnilcllngs prevail save ill the wvest of the tow;In, and only a few of the larger public or private buildings have three storeys. Santa Marta is the capital of thle large Department of Magdalena, and some of its official buildings are quite pleasing ill appearance. Inl the southwest of the town are a number of villas in gardenss, and they more closely resemable the houses of northern peoples. North of the towni has arisen a barrack-like sunurb largely inhabited by laborers onl the wharves. Very different is the sunurb south of the city where unlder beautif ul poinciana and acacia trees are the bngualows of the United Fruit Company. IlHow does Santa AMlarta illustrate our discussion onl Possibilism? The fine harbour was no doubt a major factor determining the original site, wvhile the lack of anly easily exploited resources led to the long stagnation of the town. It will no doubt be stated that its present prosperity is largely dlne to the initiative of certain Bostonians. This is no doubt true; but the Bostonians were led to Santa AMlarta by the uniqcie environment; in which nnmerons ice-fed streams flow down to the Caribbean plains. Ir1-igatioll is the key to the expansion of thle town in the last 40 years, and this is snrely a gift fromt niature; developed of course by hnman initiative. The United Fruit Company conld bnild a railway anywhere along the Spanish Main. They wisely "chose" the one district where large-scale irrigation was possible. The present writer credits the expansion of a town based oil a "Hobson's choice" of this kind to the acconnt of the determinists. SECTION B CANBERRA-THE CITY BUILT TO A PLAN ()ne of the mnost interesting hnman clusters is that of Canberra, the capital of the Commonwealth of Australia. Most of the world's chief capitals have been fairly large towns before they became of great political importance. For instance, there was a considerable popolation at Ottawa before it was chosen ill 1858. Washington onl the other handl seems to have been of little or no importance before 1790, when Hamilton, it is said in return for political favours by Jefferson, agreed to the latter's desire to place the capital on the Potomac. However Canberra belongs to this cenl- tury's history, and every detail of its development is ascertainable. More- over the writer had a fairly close personal association with the capital in its earliest years, which may add to the interest of this brief record.</page><page sequence="35">1942] CANBERRA , AUSTRALIA 35 Ini 1900 it was decreed that the capital should he huilt in the state of New South Wales. But partly dule to the jealousy of the other states it was ruled that the city should not he less than 100 miles from Sydney (the state capital). Since the western part of New South WVales is so ho, t anLld dry that it is not stited for agrictlture, it is clear that the new clitv would develop in the rather elevated and etter areas in the east of the state. Vanlotis ComllmlliSSions visited suggested sites, and the first inspection placed Bomhala ahead, with Yass and Oranoge second (Fig. 10).

Probably any of the tenl places shown on the map wotlld1 have been fairly suitable. Canberra has however some advantages. It lies close to the route linking the two chief cities of Sydney and iVIelboturne. It is 1900 feet above the sea, whiclh gives a cooler climate than that of most of the sites. It is close to a long plateau (Bimberi) w\vhich rises over 6000 feet, and here the Cotter river acts as a valuable collecting ground for the water supply of the city. - Canberra is on the line joining the centre of population of Australia (at Hillston, H on Fig. 10) to the east coast.

Onl the other hand the rainfall is low (23 inches) since the site is at the north end of the Cooma rain-shadow strip (Fig. 10). This however meant that the land was used primarily for grazing, and was not ill private hands. It is in the faulted area of southeast Australia; but earth-tremors, though not uncom- mon ill the district, have never been alarming. The two first pastoralists settled ill the district about 1823; and one of these used the name Calnberry for the district which surrounded his ranch, which lhe called Acton. The other built the house named Duntrooll oln the adjacent ranch to the east. The same squatter also erected the church at Canberra ill 1826. For a time Acton was ill the hands of the Brasseys-a well known naval famlily ill England. Further w- Rest was Yarralulmla, now used by the Governor General. The whole Federal Territory was occupied by a score of stations (ranches) mostly raisilng sheep, but in the very rugged southwest section beyond Tharwa cattle are grazed. By 1909 there were a few tiny settlements servilng these stations, such as Canberra, Tharwa, Hall, and Uriarra, some of which are shmown onl the map (Fig. 12). The total population was about 1500. The writer had described the topography of the upper Molonoglo River as early as 1907 (in his paper on Lake George), but did not visit the actual site until July 1910. At this tillme the Federal Survey was housed ill tents and ill two fabric huts just north of the Red Hill. Todav the Primle Minister's Lodcge occupies almost the samie spot. (P.M.L. ill Fig. 12.) A preliminary paper oil the topography of the Territory appeared in December 1910 (MI(ictcorol. B ld- letihi 6); and I gave a full discussion of the topography and history ill tlhe Geoyraplical Jo urzial (London) of 1914. There were only two large houses oln the city site ill those early clays. One was Acton used by the Surveyor General, and the other was the Rectory about a mile to the northeast. A little house near Ainslie was the official post office (Photo 12). Dun troon to the east soon became the nucleus of the 1M/Jilitary College; but it is still well outside the city, thougl a flourishinog suburb of the latter. The main road led from Queanbmean to Yass and ran just to the east of Ainslie. Here another road came up from Tharwa ill the south, while less important roads led to Acton ald Yar- ralmula. All these are sho11Wn by broken lilies oln Figure 12. After my return from Antarctica I was elngaged onl the geological survey of the Territory. Our chief object was to find brick-clays and buildling stones, which unfortunately are not altogether satisfactory ill the Territory itself. By 1912 there were several wooden cottages near Acton for the surveyors and clerks. A post office, drawing office, and bank had also been erected in the vicinity, and a large house (R. ill Fig. 12) was built for the Adnmlinis-</page><page sequence="38">38 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar.

Soon a short railway was run in from Queanbevan eight miles to the east; while the Power House (P.H.) w-as perhaps the most ambitious building in those early days. Meanwhile plans were invited for the future capital, and those of a Chicago architect (WN. B. Griffin) were chosen. The actual street-plan follows his design, whicir gave much prominence to the local environment. The city has developed in a broad flat plain between three conical hills, which rise respectively 400, 700, and 800 feet above the Mfolonglo plain (at about 1900 feet). The Mlolonglo river winds in its flood-silts across this plain, running westward to join the NIurrumbidgee River (Fig. 12). The main vista is the view northwards between Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie. Here Commonwealth Avenue was made the axis of the chief corridor; and it leads northwards from a low hillock, called Capital Hill, to the Civic Centre across the -Molonglo River. The cobweb pattern was adopted, with two main cobwebs at Capital Hill and the Civic Centre. But other cobwebs were also laid out, most of which are still only in the embryo stage. However in my sketch map I indi- cate a number of these lesser cobwebs; i.e., one northwest of Red Hill and three between the latter and the railway station. Another lies near Dun- troon, while the largest cobweb of all is quite outside -the sketch map to the north. This last is not yet bordered by any houses. It will be noticed</page><page sequence="39">1942] CANBERRA-OCCUPIED QUARTERS 39 that there is not much similarity between the simple early road-pattern (shown by heavy broken lines) and the rather complicated cobwebs of today. The actual arrangement of modern houses is indicated in Figure 12, though every small street is not included. It will be seen that there are three or four scattered quarters separated by wide spaces where the streets have not been developed yet. South of Capital Hill are the largest houses, with the Prime Minister's Lodge (P.M.L.) in the north. Another quarter served by a duster of shops and a theatre is to the east. Still further to the east are the Railway Stationi, Power House and Printing Office with adjacent houses. Parliment House and the chief Government buildings, are about a mile north of these residential quarters (Photo 13). PHOrO 13.-Loking southwest over Canberra.

Presuml-ably similar streets will in the future fill all the empty portions of the map, as well as the flat plain north of the Civic Centre. A dozen small parks are scattered among the street blocks, but they are omnitted in mly sketch plan. The splendid plantations in the west of the city are an attractive feature, and a small hamllet has developed near the Forestry Building to care for them. Clearly we have here a departure from the plans of most cities of today. The experiment of splitting up a small town of some 7000 people into civic and political units is very interesting. The rather wide distance be- tween the southern and northern clusters seems at present to waste a good deal of citizens' time. But in Canberra the designer is commendably look- ing forward to a city of three or four times the present size. It must be confessed that the choice of a cobweb plan supports the possibilist's thesis. ?-000 9 &gt;7300' X4 a,/os ' C 44( C L kW/a,&amp;f - e 3o/y 3.

Hence, as usual, in city evolution, we must agree that nature and manl both play important parts. SECTION C SYDNEY-A METROPOLIS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY GEOLOGICAL CONTROLS Having granted that the details of a city are man-made and lend small support to the determinist, let us devote a little time to the broad(er aspects of a city's evolution. We shall find that here the possibilist thesis meets with much less encouragement. Sydney the largest city in Australia, and the second ill the British Emipire has perhaps the most uunusual umiland that the writer has investigated. Its population is 1.3 millions, and ill U.S.A. is only exceeded by New York Chicago Philadelphia, and Detroit. It offers us all interesting study, ill part because the first settlement was so recent as 1788. The writer lived ill Sydney for over 20 years, during Most of which lhe was coimected w'ith the University there. In 1770 Captain Cook discovered the east coast of Australia, and lhe spent some days at Botany Bay (Fig. 13). Sir Joseph Banks was greatly impressed by the new flora which lhe observed here; and later lhe advised the British authorities to make the first settlement at Botany Bay. When the First Fleet arrived ill 1788, Captain Phillip was not much taken with the wide shallow bay or its sandy shores, and lhe preferred Port Jackson about 12 miles to the north (Photo 14). This magnificent harbour had ncot been visited by Cook. We may well consider for a few minutes the interaction between manl and environmient ill this locality. The build of the Sydney district is relatively simple. A somiewhat elon- gated geological "basin," withl its centre just west of Sydiey, is built tup of three main formations. The foundation rocks are Silurian slates and limestonies (1 ill Fig. 13). Above these comes a thlick series of Coal Mea- sures of Permjjo-Carboniferous age (2). Two very valuable series of coal seamns are found ill these beds of wlhich the uipper series lies about 3000 feet below the city of Sydney. This coal outcrops on the coast at Newcastle to the north, at Coalcliff to the south, and also at Lithgow. some 70 miles to the west of Sydney. Above the Coal Measures is the determining factor in human settlemient around Sydney. It is a widespread layer of rather -oarso sauidstonic about 1000 feet thick -\which. covers all area of about 1200 scquare miles. This layer of Trias sandstone (3 ill Fig. 13) is usually bounded by vertical cliffs, and these are suggested oln its western edge in Fig. 13. Along the coast both at Sydney Harbour and at the mouth of the Hawvlkesbury River, the coast consists of similar high sandstone cliffs. (On1lY the soutthern third of this sandstone area is shown ill Figure 13.) It weathers to a sterile</page><page sequence="42">42 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar.

(Courtesy, Gov- ernment Printer, Sydney, N.S.W.) sandv soil, which is covered with heathy plants or scrubby trees, and sup- ports no crops of importance. Above this Hawkesbury Sandstone is a layer of Trias shale (4), which gives rise to clay soils of much greater agricultural value. Probably if these surface strata were relatively level and undisturbed, far better conditions for close settlement would have arisen, through the deposition of silts, humus, etc. But quite lately in geological time the mar- gins of this irregular basin were warped upward. To the north of Sydney is a fairly steep warp amounting to 800 feet, to the south the land was raised by a gentle incline to a height of 1000 feet, while to the west-at a distance of 35 miles-a very marked hinge-line developed. To the west of this line the surface was elevated to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet in a remarkable "monocline." As the land rose, the Nepean River was forced to flow along the remarkable series of short gorges and alternating flats which I have described elsewhere. (These latter are omitted in the sketch Fig. 13.) As a result of these uplifts, especially in the west, the topography around Sydney is much dissected. Indeed near Katoomba are canyons 2000 feet</page><page sequence="43">1942] SYDNEY-DISTRIEBUTION OF SETTLEMENT 43 deep, of which some (like the Grose Valley, Fig. 13) end to the west in giant cliffs (Photo 15).

(Courtesy, Government Printer, Sydney, N.S.W.) ctions, and indeed not for a quarter of a century could the settlers find a way across the sandstone plateau. However the centre of the original basin ,wras not elevated; so that here the upper layer of shales was preserved, while the soft shales were soon removed from the up-warped marginal surfaces. We now have the key to the remarkable unfland of the city of Sydney. The distribution of population is given in Fig. 14.

The writer will not attempt to compare the respective total attrac tions of the two sites of Syrdney and Newcastle, but the topic is of more than- local interest.

In a large city we need to know the position of the commercial core, the industrial areas, and the general characters of the resi- dential quarters. The latter may be fowl/til class (Hdl), small inconvenient (or decayed) houses without gardens; tllir(1 class (Hc), better houses but still without much space or convenience; sccowl class (Hb) ,nmodern two- or three-storey brick houses with fair garlenis or lastly first class (Ha) with rather large gardens for a town, and of the type that at timlles might be called mansions. These types of residences are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the maps for 1885 and 1940 in Figure 16. If we iglore the other details we see that there is a constant chanlge in the position of these zones. This chanige takes place in two ways. The best class houses of one decade become thle second class houses of a later decade. But this change in zonal distribution is complicated byv the building of nlewR; sulurbs of various classes in the margillal hitherto empty regionls. There is therefore no very close resemblance between the development of a city and that of an animal. But it is somlething like the way a yountg tree grows. Its trunk and branches increase bgy a sort of expansion, while quite new charac- ters such as flowers and fruit appear as it reaches maturity. The lower diagram in Figure 16 shows Toronto in 1818. The originlal grid of nine streets was laid out about 1790, on well-drained ground at thle head of the enclosed bay, near the Don outlet; w, There also the best protection from naval attack was prestumably to be gained. The junction of King a` l George streets was the early centre of the city. By 1818 small industries such as tannilng and brewaTin g were scattered near the origilial settlement. A few larger houses were built on the margiis of the town, but all but a few of the dwliaellings were still built of wood. The population was about 1200 at this time, and the built-in area covered about half a square mile. As usual in such a young organism it is not possible to distingutish the zones wh1icl will only dliferefltiate at a later date. By 1842 the town had about 20,000 inhabitants. The centre had shifted to the lower end of Yonige Street, the main corridor to the interior. SwrTamps near the foot of Yonlge Street tenided at first to isolate the old from the new portion of the town, but these were filled ill bgy degrees; so that by 1842 this sw"Tamplancd was becomilg- the commercial core of the city. The houses were still small for the most part, but finer residences were being built on the northern margins. One of these was the Grange, which is 1now part of the City Art Gallery. The built-in area (diagonal ruling) now covered about two square miles. In 1885 the town contained about 120,000 citizens, and extended over most of the City Plain, betwleen the lake and the 40-foot cliff of thle old Lake Iroquois Shore-line. The commercial core has moved a trifle north, but</page><page sequence="48">48 TAYLOR GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar. still keeps to the Yonge Street axis. The houses are now numerous enough to show a fairly clear folliiig, rangilng from the poorest houses (4 or Hd) tup to near-mansions (1 or Ha). The underprivileged live near the heart of the city, in old houses for the most part. The wealtlhy are building large residences on the margins, where parks (as in the west) or deep ravines (as in the east) promise security from further encroachment. The built-in area covers approximately eight square miles. The city is definitely growing to the northwviaest, mainly because the deep wide valley of the Don bars ready access to the east. The little streami-valleys also guide the expansion in the same direction. It is still not easy to differentiate betweeii'thfe commercial and industrial areas of the city. In a later section (p. 59) we sihall label such a stage of development as Early Mature. In the modern city of 1940 -which contains nearly 900,000 inhabitants, if adjacent satellites are incluclecl--there has been an enormous expansion of houses in every direction, but especially to the nortlh and northwest. The old shore-line ceased to be the northern boundary about 1890. A great de- velopment of industrial plants has taken place, especially along the main railways west of the city, and on the filled-in lake areas to the southeast of thle city. The commercial core has broadened somewhat, but is still clus- terecd about Yolnge, Queen, King and Bay streets. Here also are the large department stores, which have not been differentiated in my discussion. In the last half century the thiird-class houses have become the poor-class houses of 1940. The earlier first and second-class houses have been enhmmed in by the growing city, riddled with small shops and with small industrial establishmients. They have become the tlird-class houses (3) of today. To keep pace with the immense growtvh of the city, now seven times as populous as in 1885, vast areas of third-class houses cover most of the City Plain ; but naturally many of the better houses (2) hold their own in the marginal por- tions of zone 3. The modern zone 2 has developed mainly along Yolnge Street, the main corridor to the north, especially near the fine west-east avenue called St. Clair. In the extreme west near the Humber, and the extreme east towards Scarborough Cliffs, there are other clusters of second- class houses. The positions of the four first-class suburbs (1, or Ha) are interesting. Partly they occupy the margins of ravines, as near Lawrence Park (L.P.) in the north, Rosedale (R.D.) in the east, and Humberside in the west. But the development of Forest Hill is perhaps dlue to the times of prosperity about twenty years ago. The high rolling hills of till, here about 300 feet above the lake, were beyond the city at that date, and were rapidly covered by large and expensive mansions. Possibly no similar development will</page><page sequence="49">1942] STAGES IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT 49 occor again, since both the children in families and domestic servants are nowv rather rapidly declining ill numbers. Tentative "ages" of a city I have labelled the foor stages shown in Fignre 16 with the names so familiar to Us in regard to anl evolving landscape. Most progressive cities of the occidental type go throngh similar stages. Inl the earliest stage there is no clear differentiation betweenl indnstrial, commercial, or residential areas. The first tendency is for the bigger honses to develop near the margins, where gardens and privacy are available. We see Toronto in this infantile stage tip to 1818. In the next stage there is a fairly clear segregation of ail extensive coll- mercial qoarter towards the celntre of the town,, inclnding a nnmber of streets withont residences. But shops, offices and small indnstries are still rather mixed. A definite zone of better-class honses fringes the town. The poorer folk live near the centre; ill meanly cases taking over the better honses of the former stage, bnt also bnilding new~v small honses ill any empty spaces. This may be called the JIznciile stage, and is illnstrated aronnd 1842 in Toronto. The beginning of maturity is shown by a definite differentiation of the residences. The varions types are displaced otntward as the years love on, thoogh natnrally examples of the early honses snrvive ill the expanding zones. Inl 1885 the foor classes of residences mentioned earlier were begin- mling to become evident. Poor qoarters (4) clnstered aronnd the cenltre of the town. The best residences wJere onl the margins, bht were not numerous enlotugh to forma a connected zone. Higlh Park ill the west helped to deter- mine the zone. The ravines at Rosedale attracted another area of good houses. This stage is adolescent or car-ly inathire. Inl the mature stage of Toronto we see that the concentration of industrial areas along the railways and onl the made ground is the chief chalnge in the conditions. Toronto is still growing, but the main axis of growth (i.e., the central line of the new industrial zone) is now along the railway to the northwest. There is a separation of the inldustrial city fromll the residential city, and the city is mature. Perhaps whell a definite zolning is carried out accordinlg to a laid-down plan (snich as is indicated in- Canberra) a city mlay be said to reach its zenlith or climax; ill geographical lanlguage it is late immature. The semmile condition of a city is not indicated in- Toronto. Such towns as Pekin (Fig. 5) or Nanl- king, with vast areas originally covered with houses but ]now hleaps of ruinls, may perhaps be described as partly senile. But the complexity of a large and ancient city is like the complexity of a long river like the Nile. Parts of the Nile are juvenile, others mature, others selile, depenldinig onl external factors developing during the life of the river.</page><page sequence="50">50 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [M//a r. Eiivirloji1'icluit cud[ the city's groecthi A city is obviously an artificial growth. Nature produces nothling resem- bling a city, and so at first glance would seem to have no say in the develop- ment of a city. I have discussed this aspect of the problelml as regards Toronto in several publications.1' Here therefore I wvill only introduce one diagram (Fig. 15), and point out a few examples where nature's lay-out iight well lhave been considered in deciding man'Is design. Tile Toronto enlvironlment consists of a topography built tip wholly of glacial debris, either till or sanlds. These are 300 feet thick in tle tipper part of the town, alnd about 60 feet thick in tile low Jer part. Rock outtcrops are aibsenlt everyvwlere, except ill tile bed of tile Humber. Tile City Plain ex- tenlds from Lake Ontario (246 feet) tip to tile Iroquois siloreline (425 feet). Here a sharp slope, almiost a cliff 4-0 feet or more in lheight, (wilicil was cut out by tlhe waves of foriller Lake Iroquois), separates tile lower from the tipper towvnl. The Canadian Pacific Railway runs along tile foot of the Iroquois shloreline and definitely blocks road communication with tile upper suburbs. The chief natural features of the town., however, are the ravines, which hlave been eroded in thee.till by the drainage from the former ice-sheet. Tilese are 50 to 100 feet deep, and in general run from nortlhwAlest to southeast (Fig. 15). The civic fathers followed the usual chessboard lay-out of the streets, witil thleir axes near the cardlinal directions. Hence tile roads ilave been made without the slightest reference to tile ravines, andl withotut Illuch regard for tile maill objective of the citizens' journeys (whichl was to reach tile centre of the city). Some of the most expensive city-viaducts ill tile world- hlave beell built to cross tile Don and Humber valleys. Thlese were inevitable, but otlhers over tlhe smaller ravines need lnot have beell built if the roads ilad been built aloiig the divides between the ravines. Ill the west part of tile towvn such roads would have tile added acdvantage that they led directly to the centre of the city. For instance, Vaughan Road running diagonally between ravines is a much more sensibly designed road than Spadina Road with its huge viaduct. In Toronto, as in many other fairly modern cities, the chessboard was laid out on tlhe surveyor's chlart, and often the roads were nanled before construction. Thus we find a continuous Walmer Road in the middle of thle city map (see WVal. on Fig. 15), but actually it is still in three isolated pieces. These sections are separated from each other by the Iroquois cliff, or by deep ravines, or by the railway. Tile most amusing example is Woodhine Avenue (W1, W2, W3 on 10 "Topographic Control in the Toronto Regon," Griffith Taylor. Can. Jill. ECOl1., (Nov., 1936).</page><page sequence="51">1942j TILE "ZONES AND STRATA" CONCEPT 51 Fig. 15) which has a gap three miles long ill its continuity fromll W2 to W3. It seems hardly likely that the whole of the Little Doll valley will be filled up to enable the surveyor's design to be maintained ! Yet this is mlierely a large-scale example (of which we see many smaller illustrations) of the absurdity of ignoring the environment ill planninog the development of a large city. Lack of space forbids my enumierating miany other examples of manls unsatisfactory choice of plan ill this connection. The writer would like to enter a plea for the use of the block diagram (as ill Fig. 15) to illustrate the setting of a city. Its history may be so easily summarized therefrom, as follows: The first houses ill 1793 were built near the black square ill the south- east. This is the "nucleus" of the city. By 1818 the little town had spreacl along the shoreline. Two isopleths, indicating the outer limits of built-in streets in 1889 and 1932, show the expansion of the city at two later periods. The large valleys of the Humber and the Doll, the small glacial-water ravines and the Irocquois shoreline are clearly represented. This illustration should be used ill conjtinction with the stage-diagram (Fig. 16). SECTION E THE "ZONES AND STRATA" CONCEPT APPLIED TO CITIES; TORONTO, PORT CREDIT AND WHITBY In the case of large human movements-such as racial llligrations-the use of the zones and strata technique enables us to deduce the cradle of lmman evolution anld the order of development of the races.1" But it is also of coil- siderable value ill connection with the much smaller agglomerations of man which we call villages and cities. Here also we are concerned with clusters of folk about the original nucleus, about wNhich the town gradually expanlds. What value has this technique ill city evolution? Perhaps in connection with house-types we see the process most clearly. The first houses at Toronto were log hutts, of which one is actually still preserved in the Exhibi- tion Grounds. This was originally erected where Queen Street crosses the Dotn River (Photo 16). The nearest log hut, ill use today much as it was originally, is (as far as I know) in Queensville, 35 miles north of Toronto. Thus the first stage of house has now been pushed out for 30 miles or so from its original position. The second type was the small framle house built of horizontal planks. I recently photographed one of these houses ill the heart of the city ill Queen Street opposite Osgoode Hall (Photo 17). It has now been pulled clown, but plenty of specimens still remain in corners of the city. They are now found fairly numerously ill the little to\\Tlns near Toronto; 1' See the writer's Environnment, Racc and Mligyration.

Today houses of this type andI culture are not found n-earer than Rosedlale or Forest Hill, i.c., about 4 miles north. Finally in the busiedst part of the city we find the latest type of building, the ski-sc rap er, which is almost wholly found in the vicinity of Ot i eon, Bay, and Yonge Streets. They of course constitute the most striking buildings in the commercial core. The zones are therefore fairly definite today. If we assume that the few relics of older types still remlaining are fragrments of ancient "~strata," most of which have been "buried" ie. removed), thens the evidence givent above shows hlow the teclhique cano be applied to city evolution. In other wordis all the types originated near the heart of the modern city (near the "nlu- cleus") ;but the older the type the further it has been displacedi to the miar- ginls as the city evolves. Conversely froml the dlistribution of these zones we can deduce the way inl whI-ich the houses have evolved.)- The data canl be summn-arized in a table as follows, with the oldest types of building at the foot of the table. 12 The writer first used this technique for Chicago; see his paper "Geography, the Correlative Science."

In effect he said "Look around you, and you will be able to reconstruct the evolution of the coral atoll." The epitaph of Wren the architect in Saint Paul's in a sense contains the same idea, ''Si requ-iris iiiomiituciitaiii, ci rcuin1l- spice." We can usefully apply the same concept of "looking around you" to city evolution. The village is father to the city; hence if we study a village in the same environment as the city, we shall learn something as to an early stage in the evolution of the city. I have made a number of surveys of towns and villages in southern Ontario, and I think it will be of interest to discuss two of these. Port Credit is a little town on the lake 13 miles west of Toronto. It has about 2000 inhabitants, and in some ways resembles an early stage of Toronto, when the latter contained about the same number of folk. (It is not of much sig- nificance that modern features such as electricity in Port Credit had no counterpart in the early stages of Toronto.) My second illustration is the town of Whitby (5000 inhabitants), which has grown tip about 27 mailes east of Toronto with much the same topography and hinterland as the other two lake settlements. Port Credit was first settled in 1804 at the mouth of the Credit River (Fig. 18), and until 1845 the village was confined to the western bank. Almost all the houses were wooden, and wer-e mostly two-storey gabled residences, of which several still survive. The next few decades were quite prosperous, and the little town had a considerable trade with U.S.A. in grain and timber (Photo 18). There was a bJuSY port witlh quays, harbour works and a lighthouse. But tariff laws ruined the American grain trade, while 13 If you wish- to pronounce "Circunmspice"; Don't rhyme it with "Mice" . . . but with "Mickey"!</page><page sequence="55">19421 POST CRIFDIT, ONTARIO 55 all the timber was exhausted in the hinterland during the seventies. The storms around 1878 demolished the harbour works, and they were never rebuilt. The railway station was placed on the east side of the estuary in 1855, and this led to the development of a new town nearer to the station, in which - 9t &lt;Ott k Brick I. 2 X 2 Ad &amp;Rv(w)-Pt (E) lop 0t0I588 eor r-2 jio 45 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ FIG 182 (ft-A- funtiona pla of th litetw fPr Crdt westoforoto.Two scntouseredcae Th house are in fou clsss Ha Hb Hc an Hd th lager ar osl 01 shacks.

The 1populatiou was about 450 ill 1877, when the town contained three churches and three hotels; which is the same as today with a population almost 2000. Iln 1900 the easteru portion equalled the western in area, but since that date there has been a great expansion to the east, as Figure 18 shoows. Thus Port Credit developed ill three stages; the old vooclen town ill the west till 1855 or so; the miodern brick and wood towNln between the station and the little harbour till 1900 and after that date the newer portion right in the east. There are two large industrial plants, each givinog work to about 100 employees. The Starch Company commenced about 1889, and the large Oil Refinery in- 1933. Today the town contains two schools and a High School, two banks and a large brick post office. The two rows of shops shown onl the main street comprise 3 stores, 4 cafes, 3 realtors, 3 barbers, 2 butchers, a drug store, anud a picture house. The town pattern is early matuitrc, sin-ce the older wooden houses were long ago replaced by brick near the shopping centre. The cheap wooden houses (Hd) have grown tup oln the margills, partly ill response to the two large industrial plants. The very slow growth of the town has prevented the change of early homies (Hc) into the near-slums (Hd ill part) as in Toronto. The group of large brick houses (Ha) ill the southeast is not a natural out- growth of Port Credit, but a sort of forest-suburb of Toronto. It seemis likely that the oldest western part of the tonll, consisting largely of wooden houses, gives us some idea of Toronto about 1840, though the latter was of course far larger (Photo 18). The addition of the newer east- ern portion of the town with its numerous two-storey brick houses affords a picture which to some extent resembles Toronto ill the seventies, before the development of special industrial sections ill the city. T he large houses (Ha) ill the southeast, each surrounded with a large garden and often by small forest trees, are really outlying parts of Toronto, for their owners have ill general not much cultural connection with Port Credit. However there are still many acres of farmland separating the little town fromt the mlletropo- lis. Not yet has it joilned Long Branch and 1\Iimico and become a mere satellite of Toronto. A second example of a small town oil the lake-shore near Toronto will show uls the normal development of a town considerably larger than Port Credit. I haave chosen Wh;jjitbzy, wNhiclh is 22 miles east of the metropolis. Its site is much the same as at Port Credit, save that there is no river there, but only a small shallow bay which has been converted into a harbour b)y a breakwater across the nmouth. The main cross-road follows along one of the usual broad north-south ridges of this coast. The 300-foot contour is shown on Figure 19. The swamips near the harbour have prevented house develop- ment near the lake. As at Port Credit, the clays of shipping grain and timber have passed. Now oil is the chief import, and is stored ill four tanks which</page><page sequence="58">58 TAYLOR-GE-NETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [MTTar. take the place of bygone elevators. A stllbulrl) south of the Canadian National railway survives from these earlier clays. The total popuilation is about 4500. Whitly today has developed at the cross-roads, where the Toronto- Kingstonl corridor crosses the north-south road to the little port. The impor- tance of Whitby as a port has almost vanlished, but a number of small fac- ealinlg wRitll br-ass-)rk tanig, bl)lankets, and canning, are adding to the vitality of the little agricultural townii. The factories are nOt yet segre- gatecl, indeed several of them are not even onl the various railways wh1ich meet at Whitby. The pattern of the town shows the uisuial inner zone of shops at the cross- roads together with the post office and Townv Hall. Outside this is the zolle of largelr hoses, lleal- T all of lbrick (2 ill Fig. 19), and here are found the chief churches. Beyond these zoi.les the houses are onl the whole built of wood, the nearer being usually two-storey and the distant houses one-storey. However a few larger houses are of course to be found ill these zones also. A large Ladies' College is isolated on a ridge to the east of the town11. Although the town is twice as large as Port Credit it is not ill quite such anl advanced stage of uirban development , mainly because the factories are smaller. The toWln may be described as ill the aulolcsc(cit stage, for there is no industrial zone and no zone of larger residences. Owing to the vicinity of Toronto, which tends to attract so much lof the local trade, it does not seem likely that Whitby will soon advance much beyond this stage of cldevelopment. SE'CTION F THE CLASSIFICATION OF TOWNS There are innumerable types of towns scattered over the face of the earth, but it seems possible to clarify ouir ideas a little by "look1inlg around" for stages ill evolution as suggested earlier. The earliest settlements and towllns seem to have (levelopecl ill Mesopotamia ()r thereabouts. We can undoubtedly still finld examples which cliffer little from those evolved many thousand years ago. They developed in turn into the crowded oriental townlS of today. Perhaps one useful distinction is that between the oriental (or at any rate non-European) tcmwn and the occ0iC/lfal town of Europe or North America. This latter had its fairly well-defined evolution, whlich Geclcles and Iltiunforcl have examined.1 WNe may uise their terms, wvhich I have briefly defined in parentheses. Eotechnic (wvalled) towns, Baroque (palace) tDwlns, Paleotechnic (industrial) tOWvns, Neotechnic (planned) toC)Wns, Biotechnic (regional) towns, cane all still be studied if we look far enoulghl afield. In accord with the Zones and Strata Concept the more primitive towns 14 Patrick Geddes, Cities iil Evolutioni, London, 1915. Lewis MIN'umford, CGnit/-c of Cities, New York, 1938.</page><page sequence="59">1942] CLASSIFICATION OF TOWVNS 59 will be found near the marginis, the more advanced near the centre of stimu- luis. Accordingly near New York and London we see the latest types, garden cities such as Radburn (N. J.) and LetchlwoN-orth near London. These are perhaps Neotcchutic iln character. But the great majority of our occi- dental towns are Palcotecliic. Still, in qcuiet districts such as Carlsruihe or Versailles, we may gain some idea of the Baroqute town of 200 years ago. Still further afield Old Carcassonne and Aigues M\/Iortes in the south of France have changed little fromt the Eot(echuic style. In Africa the oriental town still remains very little altered by a thousand years of progress else- where. In the present address I am almost entirely concerned with the indus- trial (Paleotechnic) type of towni. It is the stilcdivisions of this type with which we are immediately concerned. I have already suggested that most cities of our age and culture pass through a numbel of similar stages. It should be the duty of the urban geographer to integrate his data in this research, much as WV. MI. Davis did in his classic studies of the evolution of landscapes. But our problem will be more difficult, since our agent-deter- milinig the evolution of cities-is imaii the irrational, while the agent in his prolblem was ever-logical XAaatuitrc. The matter may well be set out in a table as follows: CLASSES OF TOW\NS; SUBDIVISIONS Or PALEOTECHNIc TOWvNS Evolution of towns Occidental or Oriental. Occidental towns Eotechnic, Baroque, Paleotecimic, Neotecimic, Biotechnic. Paleotechnic stages Infantile, Juvenile, Adolescent, Mature, Senile. Infantile towns (In) Haphazard distribution of houses and shops, no factories. Juvenile towns (Ju) Differentiation into zones (of houses and shops) starts. Adolescent (Ad) Scattered factories-, no definite zone of 'Ha' houses. Early Mature (Er) Resideiice zones fairly defined, no segregation of factories. Mature (Ma) Four zones of houses, separate commercial and industrial areas. Late Mature (La) Indications of advance to biotechnic development. Senile (Se) Large areas of town abandoned, remainder stagnlant. Foariiu/ac for toarems In a genietic approach to urban geography we are chiefly interested in the town as an evolving organism. We want to know its present pattern, hmowR that developed, and where and why the town started. For the present we caln ignore the street plan, the source of its tradle, the extent of its um-ilancl, andl a vast number of other interestinog features of a city. I see the city as a series of zones, expandling fromt the original nucleus, and usually condlitionedl in its growth by the surroundling environment, unless we are dlealing with a city of the plains. Several features therefore seem to be essential in our proposedl formulae. We shouldl know solmnething as to the original site or</page><page sequence="60">60 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [ Mar. nlutcletus; as to the reason for its founding; as to its grow~th with respect to the nucleus. As regards the zones, we should know their width and position. Further we might well include some clue to its stage of development, and of course a reference to the total populatioln. In 1938 I read a paper before this Association dealing wvith a nluter of towns in the Italian region of the Trentino. There I gave a preliminary description of formulae, including many of these terms. Since that time I have been trying to apply the same technique to American and other towns. I feel sure that such research is worth while, avid equally sure that the techniqlue which is suggested herewith will be greatly iniprovecl upon as time goes on.

Let us run over the description of Port Credit and see how our formula would work out (Fig. 18). The population is about 2000. This would be represented by "2' (the number of thousands) in the formula. The town was originally a lake-port on a little river. This is indicated 1by Rv Pt. \Vith regard to the nultcleuts, the river is to the west, and the lake (or sea) to the southeast. So our for1mla becomes "Rv (XV.) Pt (S.E.) ." The stage of development is between adolescent and early mature. Since it is so smnall a town, and the mansions are linked to Toronto rather than to Port Credit, it would seema to be adolescent (Ad). This general portion of the formula forms the left side of our equation. Now we may turn to the particular zones, wvhich appear in the. rig/it-hand side of the equation. The present shopping cenltre has been shifted fromt the original nucleus, about I kilometre to the north. Thus the shop-zonle appears as "Sh(1N.)." The house-zones should be given in order from the centre of the town outwards. Tlus the second-class, houses (Hb) form a zone with</page><page sequence="61">1942] FORMULAE FOR CLASSIFICATION 61 a centre about one kilomietre northeast of the nucleus i.e., Hb(1N.E.). Then comes Hc, the original large wooden houses wlhiclh still surrounnd the nncleus, but also cover a zone one kilometre to the north, i.e., Hc(Nu - IN.). The shacks Hd are founld one kilometre west of the nucleus and also 2 kilo- metres north and so we get Hd (1\V. + 2N.). Finally the large hrick houses (not quite mansions) represent class Ha, and are heing huilt 2 kilometres northeast of the nucleus i.e., Ha (2N.E.). The total formula comprises two sides of anl equation as follows: 2Ad + Rv(W.)Pt(S.E.) - Sh (-IN.) + 1-Hl(1N.E.) + Hc(Nu i 1N.) T Hd(1W. - 2N.) + Ha(2N.E.) The factories are not arranged in a zonle hence are not mentioned in the formula; bht the presence of a few factories may The gathered fromt the fact that the town is adolescent. To reconstruct a rough plan fromt the formula, we proceed as follows (see the inset in Fig. 18). A large dot is placed for the nuclens, and con- centric circles are draw~n with radii increasing hy half kilometres. \Ve can add the river coming in from the west, and the lak e shore along the south. The distance indices (in the hracklets) show the position of the centre of a zone. Thus the shops canl he placedl half a kilometre to the north of the nucleus. If reasonable patches or zones he drawvn contignous to each other, in accord with the indices we ohtain a plan whiclh is quite close to the actual pattern of Port Credit, and gives us almost all the characteristic features of the settlement. The formula for \.Vhitby canl be obtained in the same fashion. It comes out somewhat as follows: 4.5 Ad - CrPt(3S.) = Sh (Nu) + HI)(-1E. I?V.) - Hc(S.-1- 1VS.) T Hd( N. + I1S. + 21 S.) We may interpret this as follows. A small town in the adolescent stage with a population of 4,500 has developed at a cross-roads with a little port 3 kilometres to the south. Onl the right of the equation we find the zones; i.e. the shops at the nuclens, witlh three house-zones at varions distances as shown in the brackets. For instance there are three separate areas of Hd (smallest honses) : at one-half kilometre north, one kilometre sonth, and again at 21 kilometres sonth. A reconstrnction from the formnla is given as an 2 inset in Figure 19. It clearly gives us a fair pictnre of the actual plan of Vlhitby. Forll-fae for Toronito. Turning noxv to the four diagrams given in Figure 16 we may reduce the zones to formulae somewvhat as follows: Toronto was primarily a harbour, and the sandy hook (shown in Fig. 15) was probably more vital in 1793 than it would be now. For instance, such important ports as Chicago and Gary lhave been developed where natural</page><page sequence="62">62 TAYLOR GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar.

But as time went oln the political aspects became of great impor- tance. Hence we must indicate that Toronto is a Capital (Cp) ill our formula. Obviously each of the four maps of Toronto (at different periods) has a different formula; but the nucleus is always as indicated by the little circle in the earliest map. For the town in 1818 the formula is 1.2 Ila + Pt (S.) Cp = Hd (Nu) HI) (2WV.) For the town ill 1842 we get 20 Ju + Pt(S.)Cp Hc(Nu + 2W.) + Slh(lW.) + H11)(2N.W. -'- N.E.) For the town ill 1885 120 Er+ Pt(S.)Cp- Hcl(Nu?+2W.) + Of(1W.) -P Hc(N. -3W.) + Hb (3N. + 4N.W. + 4W.) + Ha (2N. 4- 5W. ) For the present town ill 1940, the formula is naturally a long one. 890 Ma + Pt (S.) Cp = 5Hd (Nu + 1E. + 3W.) + Of ( 1W.) + Fc ( 11S.E. 4W. + 6N.V.) + Hc[7(2N.E. - 3N.W.) + 6N.V.] + Hb(4E. 4N. - 7N.W.) + Ha(3N. + 6N.W. + 9N.W.) In this formula the area covered bgy tlird-class houses (Hc) is in two definite belts. These are suggested by the double brackets in the formula. Obviously other details may be added to the formula. For instance apart- ment houses form a characteristic zone (for whichl we may use the abbrevi- ation "Apa-so") five kilometres to the northwest of the original nucleus. This could be shown as "Ap(5N.WV.)." Since no figure appears outside the "direction" bracket, we should plot it as a patclh less than kilomletre wide. We may use the contraction 'Holu-fo" for the characteristic house-zones, amd so for the other leading features which determine the character of the town and formula.

The present town had as a nucleus the medieval castle (Ft. i.e., Fort) which commanded the wide glacial trough of the Adige River.1 It was, till lately, a typical walled (Eotechnic) town; while the modern town is of the adolescent Paleo- technic type (Photo 19). Its present population is about 60,000. Hence -4. PHoro 19.-The town of Trento in the Alpine portion of Italy.

If we draw the half kilometre circles about the nucleus, we summarize the "Hou-zo" as follows (on the right of the equation). Hb(S.W.) + 2Ap(S.) + Ha(S.E.) + Of ( 1 S.W.) - Hc(I1N.W.) There is no well-developed belt of industries, though a few factories occur in the northeast. A modernist tourist quarter occurs in the heart of the Hc zone; but is too small to be represented in the formula. 15 "Trento to the Reschen Pass," Griffith Taylor. Geog.

It is situated near the junction (Jn) of the Adige and the Isarco (which rises in the Brenner Pass). It is built on the large detrital fan of the Talvera Torrent. Like Trento it is half Eotechnic and half Paleotechnic in pattern. The 'Hou-zo ' are perhaps more regular in Bolzano, and the formula is as follows: 40 (Eo-Ad) -FnJn(14S.W.) = Hc(Nu) -- Of( S.W.) - Ap( W. - X E.) - Ha (1NN . -- IN.E.) The little Village of Laives with a population of about 500 has grown up on a fan about 8 miles south of Bolzano (Fig. 20). It is less than one kilometre across (Photo 20). Here we find merely a series of about 60 PHOTO 20.-Laives, a small notch-village built on an alluvial fan in the Adige Cor- ridor about 8 miles south of Bolzano.

Enough examples have been given for the reader to realise that it is quite possible to summarise in a one-line fornmula the salient features of a town.

I have not attempted to</page><page sequence="65">1942] POSSIBILISM IN RACE AND NATION 65 cover any but paleotechnic towns (i.e., the usual occidental industrial towns); but of those referred to earlier in this address, Pekin is oriental with some senile characters; while Biskra is partly paleotechnic and partly oriental. Urandanji, McMurray, and Waterways are infantile. Canberra with its cobweb patterns and its isolated communities is neotechnic, approaching the biotechnic town; but lack of space forbids my discussing any but the paleo- technic type of town. SECTION G POSSIBILISM APPLIED TO RACE, NATION AND CITY As most of my readers know, I have always been a rather definite environ- mentalist. In concluding this address, I wish to consider whether deter- minism or possibilism is of more importance in connection with the three types of human groups which I have studied with some thoroughness. In my book on the major human races (Environmnent, Race and Migration, cit.), I advanced data which seemed to me to prove that in the remote past races had actually differentiated as the result of environmental control and environ- mental changes. In those remote periods (certainly prior to 20,000 years ago) man migrated primarily for the same reasons as the higher mammals. He exercised little choice, and a geographer in those days would almost certainly have been a whole-hearted determinist! Thus the major human clusters in the far past were certainly chiefly controlled by environment. In the later historic period, the major migrations of earlier times, and the mass-migrations of today, seem to me to illustrate the push from the home- land combined with the pull of the pioneer lands. If a man experiences neither push nor pull, he stays at home. A study of the environmental con- trols of various parts of the world, and the way in which these may affect migrations of the future was published by the writer in 1922.16 Turning now to the smaller groups such as the nations of Europe, I studied the reasons for the distributions of cultures, towns and populations in that continent. It seemed to me clear than those anthropomorphic ser- vants of the environment, King Coal, King Frost, and King Drought, were far more important in producing the population-pattern of saturated Europe than were the actions and orders of men, from Charlemagne and Napoleon downward. The widespread changes due to human orders (i.e., "choice") produced permanent results only if they were in line with environmental con- trol, but if not, such changes were soon dissipated or annulled. (Environ- ment and Nation, cit.). In a general sense this is true of major cultures as of major populations. Roumanian culture has persisted chiefly owing to the ever-present refuge 16 "Distribution of Future White Settlement" Geog. Rev., 12 (July, 1922).</page><page sequence="66">66 TAYLOR-GENETIC URBAN GEOGRAPHY [Mar. given by the southern Carpathian plateaux. Italian culture is the creation of the northern Alpine barrier. Swiss culture clings to its Alpine refuge. French culture is Roman culture, bounded by the Rhine barrier and the Rhine defence. German culture is in large part the non-Roman culture preserved in the thick forests of the west German plain. British culture is due to her sea-girt island. Yet it is clear to the impartial student that as the human clusters become smaller, the general effects of environmental control on the unit become intermingled with rather special results due to man himself. Thousands of worthy Americans live in Indiana today, partly because (as the possibilists say) the ancestral emigrants "chose" to leave England. But what seems an even more potent reason to a determinist is that the environment favoured large and prosperous families. Other quite similar emigrants, in the distant past, chose to migrate to the West Indies, but their numbers have remained negligible; for environmental reasons as I see it. Ratzel was the great German protagonist of determinism; and I have often wondered if the growth of Possibilism in France was not in some measure due to a national antipathy to all things German. Indeed I have seen the statement that Haushofer's modern Geopolitics (extreme Imperial- ism) is a logical outcome of Ratzel's Determinism. Could not one as well derive the many dangerous schisms in French politics from the individualism of French Possibilisim! I illustrate the effect of environment upon one's philosophic creed by an exaggerated reference to certain American geog- raphers. I ask you to- pity our unfortunate colleagues who have been brought up in that part of the Eastern States whimsically called the "Middle West." The region between Chicago, Omaha and St. Louis has so uniform a climate and so level a topography that major environmental controls are necessarily almost lacking. Moreover the general conditions were so favourable to settlement (at any rate in the early days) that wise, medium, or foolish, choices of settlement-technicques all resulted in a fair measure of prosperity. How could our worthy Middle West colleagues escape becoming Possibilists! I said I was exaggerating, but I do firmly believe that on some nine-tenths of the earth's surface man's choice is so limited as to be almost negligible. There is usually only one way to exploit the terrain most successfully, and it can only be ascertained by lengthy and thorough investigation of the environ- ment. The third of our categories concerns town and cities. Here we are deal- ing with man-made structures, and it is evident that man can choose every detail of the object of his own creating. Here I grant that possibilism plays a role of greater importance that does the environment. Yet even in the</page><page sequence="67">1942] POSSIBILISM IN CITY AND TOWN 67 innumerable towns of the fertile plains of the Middle West-where the chief feature of a suburb is said to depend on which side of the railway it lies-even in these checkerboard towns there are many problems which depend very largely on the environment. I often wonder why there is so much opposition by geographers to the concept of environmental control. One would think little of a doctor who spent ten years studying medicine, and then practised according to the tenets of Mary Baker Eddy. Or of a lawyer who summed up his studies in the words of Bumble the Beadle, and loudly proclaimed that the "Law is an Ass." A student of the widespread sterile areas in the world inevitably tends to become somewhat of a determinist. It is precisely because the student of Urban Geography is engaged in the field which is least affected by environ- mental control that I have dwelt on possibilism in this address. Man, like every other living creature, is a parasite on the surface of the earth. He exists by exploiting the environment. For me, the answer to our con- troversy (possibilism versus determinism) is suggested by a modification of the old proverb, "Nature pays the piper, and, in most parts of the world, she also calls the tune." A dozen years ago I was in Shanghai, and made some study of Sun Yat Sen's book "International Development of China." I was much impressed to find that this book, by the leader of the young Republican Party of China, was largely a study of the economic geography of that country. We see the same thing in the plans of the Soviet Union. Some day our discipline will progress beyond its present stage of the Cinderella of the sciences. Cannot we geographers study the world to such purpose that we shall in time be accepted as a body well suited to guide the nation along the paths of material and cultural progress? Can we not all strive to become Nation-Planners ?17 May the day come when the public will say of every careful student of our discipline, "He has studied material progress all over the world. He knows the possibilities, and can interpret our environment to our best benefit. In a word he is a competent geographer. We must listen to him." Acknowledgem~tents.
