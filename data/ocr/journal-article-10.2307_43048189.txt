Willem came here in order to continue his doctoral research while I was appointed as a teacher of Hellenistic Greek and New Testament interpretation. As close col- leagues Willem and I had regular and- owing to Willem' s often challenging points of view - long and intense discussions about our common field of study. This was the beginning of a friendship which would last until Willem* s early death. I appreciate the initiative of his South African colleagues and students to prepare a volume in memory of Willem, and I am greatly honoured to be able to contribute. In the course of time our discussions tended to concentrate on two thematic clusters. The first was closely related to our gradual dissatisfaction with historical-critical approaches to biblical texts. Willem was convinced- perhaps even more than I was- that New Testament scholars were too much concerned with phenomena behind the text (religio-historical backgrounds, traditio- 0254-8356/94 $4,00 Â© NTSSA ABSTRACT The first part of this paper discusses various forms of Christian Judaism and their relationship to lawfree Christianity. It is argued that it was on the basis of Luke- Acts that the Church Fathers were able to condemn Christian Jews as sectarians who had turned away from the original apostolic truth. The second part tries to explain why Gnostic philosophers were interested in the biblical stories about the creation of man and the early history of humankind, why Christians felt attracted to Gnostic mythological stories and their apparent distor- tions of Old Testament scripture, and why they were prepared to present the Gnostic myth of origins as the definitive truth revealed by Jesus Christ. It concludes with a few observations concerning the relationship between Gnostic and non-Gnostic Christians and their eventual separation.</page><page sequence="2">220 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS historical developments, sources and influences) and did not pay enough atten- tion to the meaning of the finished texts. At a later time, our interest shifted from the text to its readers: to the history of reception of New Testament texts but also to the question of how the intended audience might have understood the message of the text1. I will not pursue this complex of questions here. It will certainly be dealt with in other contributions to this volume. The other cluster of themes discusssed by us during many years is of a very different kind. Willem and I, presumably influenced by the sphere of interest of professor Klijn and other scholars in Groningen, became more and more aware that early Christianity must have been a highly pluriform phenomenon and that whoever is interested in the early development of the Christian reli- gion cannot restrict his or her studies to the writings of the canonical New Testament.2 While Willem became more interested in the reception of early Christian writings and in the role of the reader in the assignment of meaning to the text, my attention was drawn to those early forms of Christianity which, from the point of view of later mainstream Christianity, were regarded as heterodox. Initially (in connection with the preparation of my dissertation on the Revela- tion of Elchasai) I was interested mainly in the surviving evidence of Jewish Christianity (I now prefer the designation 'Christian Judaism', see below), and later in early Christian Gnosis. It is in line with our discussions when I dwell here on problems connected with the study of early Christian Judaism and Christian Gnosis. I will elaborate upon several ideas discussed with Willem on diverse occasions. Of course this does not mean that Willem always agreed with my views. 2 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM I use the designations 'early Christian Jews' and 'Nasoraean Jews' to refer to Jews who believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah (or as the greatest of Israel's 1 Cf Willem's essay 'Intertextuality and Redaktionsgeschichte ' in: S. Draisma (ed), lntertextuality in Biblical Writings : Essays in honour of Bas van 1er sel , Kampen: Kok 1989, ppl5-26. Willem was an active member of a seminar of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas in which the reception of New Testament texts (notably Rm 13:1- 7) was a main topic of discussion. 2 Cf Willem's remark at the end of his contribution to the Festschrift for A.F.J. Klijn, The Protevangelium of James and Intertextuality' in: T. Baarda (et al), Text and Testimony , Kampen: Kok 1988, pp262-75): '(Professor Klijn...) has taught me not to restrict my views on early Christianity to those presented by the canonical writing. Early Christian faith was after all a dynamic process, not a closed system* (:275).</page><page sequence="3">NEOTESTAMENTICA 28(3) 1994 (Special Edition) 221 prophets)3. I suggest that these designations include the first Jewish followers of Jesus (in the few decades before the emergence of lawfree Christianity) as well as the law-keeping Jewish believers of the next four centuries (who were treated as dissidents by early rabbinic Judaism and by emerging mainstream Christianity). This enables us to distinguish, on the one hand, two subsequent stages of early Christian or Nasoraean Judaism, and, on the other, lawfree mainstream Christianity. In the New Testament we find two conflicting answers to the question of how lawfree Christianity originated and how it was related historically to the Judaism of Jesus and his first followers. The first answer is given in the letters of Paul, notably in his letter to the Galatians, the other in the Lucan writings, particularly in the Book of Acts, the only canonical writing which presents a coherent overview of events and developments during the first generations of Christians.4 2.1 The letter to the Galatians It is apparent from the letter to the Galatians that Paul's proclamation of a gospel without circumcision and observance of the law was a new development in the early Christian movement, a development, that is, which was initially disapproved of by the apostles in Jerusalem and which also at a later time encountered much opposition and incomprehension. Paul is convinced that he himself took the decisive step to exempt Gentiles who believed in Christ from observance of the Jewish law. Moreover, he affirms that he did so without consulting the church leaders in Jerusalem (Gl 1:15-20). For several years he had proclaimed a lawfree gospel in Syria and Cilicia before he went to Jerusalem, in the company of Barnabas and the uncircumcised Titus, in order to defend his gospel before James, Peter and John (1:21-2:10). Back in Antioch (2:11-14) and later in Galatia and elsewhere Paul was confronted with Christian Jews who objected to his separating gospel and Torah observance. The letter to the Galatians shows a fierce reaction by Paul to the activity of similar opponents in the communities he founded in Galatia. Furthermore the letter makes it clear that under the influence of Paul's Christian Jewish opponents, at least some Gentile converts sought salvation i Today, the current designation of Jews believing in Jesus is 4 Messianic Jews' or- with a missionary connotation - 4 Jews for Jesus'. As a rule they share the traditional beliefs of orthodox Christianity. In this respect, they resemble the Nasoraeans of the fourth century (see below).

Kampen: Kok 1991, ppi 63-89.</page><page sequence="4">222 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS through observance of the law (5:4; cf 4:21), that they were prepared to be cir- cumcised (5:2-3 and 6:12-13) and to observe sabbath and the Jewish feasts (4:10). Apparently Paul's rivals had convinced his converts that their belief in Jesus would not be complete as long as they had not incorporated themselves - through circumcision- into the people of the covenant (cf 3:3) and as long as they did not live according to God's law. They seem to have assured these Gentile converts that God's promises to Abraham were meant only for Abraham's legal heirs (cf 3:7 and 4:28) and that Jerusalem remained the mother of all those who worship Israel's God (cf 4:26). It may be added here that there are good reasons to assume that the opinions of the critics of Paul's missionary preaching were closely related to those of the author of the first Gospel.5 In all likelihood, Matthew held the view that Gentiles who wished to be disciples of Jesus were obliged to observe the whole Mosaic law and thus should be circumcised. We are forced to accept this as a conclusion if we are right in considering Jesus' commission to go to all Gentile peoples, make them his disciples and teach them to observe every- thing he had commanded (Mt 28:19-20) combined with Jesus' principal state- ments about the enduring validity of the law, quoted in 5:17-20 (cf also 23:3). In no way does Matthew's Gospel indicate why these commandments of Jesus should not apply to Gentile believers. 2.2 The Lucan writings In the Lucan writings, composed some 25 to 50 years after Paul's letter to the Galatians, we find quite a different view of how the origin of lawfree Christianity was related to the Judaism of Jesus and his first followers. The author suggests that there is a direct and unbroken line from Israel and its prophets to Jesus, and from Jesus- via the testimony of the apostolic wit- nesses-to Paul and the Pauline communities. He is convinced that with the coming of Jesus the time of redemption, promised to Israel, had been realised, and that this redemption was destined for all people (cf esp Lk 2:30-31 and Ac 13:46-47). In Acts, Paul's preaching of a gospel without observance of the Mosaic law is definitely not considered a new and revolutionary development in the early Christian movement. The opposite is true. Paul's work is presented as the logi- cal continuation of the mission to the Gentiles initiated by the so-called Hel- lenists and by the apostle Peter. It is not an exaggeration to state that, accord- ing to Acts, Peter is the apostle of the Gentiles, and not Paul. Compare the words spoken by Peter during the meeting of apostles and elders in Jerusalem: 5 Cf U. Luz, Das Evangelium nach MatthÃ¤us (EKK 1,1), 1985, p 69.</page><page sequence="5">NEOTESTAMENTICA 28(3) 1994 (Special Edition) 223 4 You know that in the early days God made his choice among you: From my lips the Gentiles were to hear and believe the message of the gospel' (Ac 15:7). As a witness to Jesus (the definition of Ac 1:21-26 precludes that Paul is an apostle) Paul continues outside Israel's boundaries the task commissioned to Peter and to the other apostles (Ac 1:8). Thus there is a clear difference between Paul's view of the relation of the Judaism of Jesus' first followers to emerging lawfree Christianity and the view forwarded by Luke. Paul affirms that the disconnection of gospel and Torah observance was introduced by himself. Up to this point his opponents in Galatia were of the same opinion. But, whereas his critics rejected this innova- tion, Paul believed himself to be called by God (Gl 1:15-16) to proclaim that in the Messianic era all believers- not just the Jews- participated in the fulfil- ment of God's promises to Abraham, and that accordingly the law had lost its former function as a protective fence around the chosen people of Israel (3:19, 24). In the Lucan writings we may look in vain for the differences of opinion which accompanied Paul's proclamation of a lawfree gospel to the Gentiles. In Luke- Acts such notions as harmony, continuity and gradual progression prevail. It is important to note that Luke's view on the continuity between Israel, the first community of believers in Jerusalem, and lawfree Pauline Christianity enabled the early church fathers to condemn contemporary Christian Judaism as a heretical aberration. On the basis of Luke-Acts the church fathers were convinced that lawfree Christianity was the only legitimate continuation of the beliefs of the apostles. On the assumption that Christian Jews were sectarians who had turned away from the original apostolic truth, they were inclined to hold a putative heterodox teacher (a 'heresiarch') responsible for the origin of these sectarian communities. It should be clear, however, that as far as their attitude towards the Mosaic Law is concerned, Christian or Nasoraean Jews could correctly refer to a tradition going back to Jesus and his first disciples. 2.3 Nasoraeans, Ebionites, Elkesaites It would seem that initially the name 'Nasoraeans', that is, followers of 'the Nasoraean', referred to all disciples of Jesus (cf Ac 24:5). 6 At a later time, when uncircumcised Gentiles were admitted to the communities of believers in ^ The designation 'Nasoraean' is applied to Jesus in Mt 2:23 and in several other New Testament passages. The most plausible explanation of this name still is that it was derived from the word netzer ('branch '/'sprout' [of Jesse]) in Is 11:1, and thus qualifies Jesus as Messianic son of Jesse and David (see Ac 13:22-23). Cf R.A. Pritz, Nazarene Jewish Christianity. Leiden: Brill 1988, ppll-14.</page><page sequence="6">224 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS Jesus, the name 'Christians', that is, followers of Christos , came into use (cf Ac 11:26). For this reason the designation 'Nasoraean Jews' or simply 'Nasoraeans' can be used as an equivalent of 'Christian Jews'.7 It is only at the end of the fourth century that the name 'Nasoraean s' /nazareni -turns up as the name of a sect. But actually the only 'heretic' element Epiphanius ( Panarion 29) and Jerome could find in the Nasoraeans was their full observance of the Mosaic law. The fourth century Nasoraeans accepted Paul and his mission to the Gentiles, and they believed in the virgin birth and the divine sonship of Jesus. The Gospel they read must have been a free Aramaic translation of the canonical Matthew.8 Obviously these Nasoraeans were profoundly influenced by the teachings of the orthodox church. On this fundamental point they differed from the Ebionites (see below). It is somewhat confusing indeed that the name 'Nasoraeans' can be used to refer to the whole phenomenon of early Christian Judaism but also to a subgroup. What distinguished the Nasaoraeans as a subgroup of Christian Jews was their gradual adoption of (proto-)orthodox beliefs. The name 'Ebionites' (the more usual spelling of the sources is 'Ebionaeans') is related etymologically to the Hewbrew word ebjonim , 'poor ones'. Apparently, communities of followers of Jesus called themselves 'the poor', in the sense of 'poor before God' (cf the first beatitude in Mt 5:3). As far as we know, Tertullian ( CarChr 14; 18; 24) is the first to derive the name from a supposed heresiarch 'Ebion'. The Ebionites were followers of Jesus who lived in conformity with the law of Moses. Origen accounts for the pos- sibility that they were motivated to do so by their desire to imitate Christ {Matth comm ser 39). The Ebionites maintained a 'natural' christology: In their view Jesus was the son of Joseph. According to Irenaeus ( Haer 3.21.1), their text of Is 7:14 mentioned a 'young woman' (not a 'virgin'). The Ebionites did not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus and they denied his divinity. Irenaeus reports that according to the Ebionites, Paul had rejected the Mosaic law (1 .26.2). Several Christian Jewish communities existed in Syria and Mesopotamia (Epiphanius does not clearly distinguish these diverse groups and calls several of them 'Ebionites', cf esp Panarion 30). Traces of one branch of Christian Judaism in Syria can be found in the pseudo-Clementine writings. These 'pseudo-Clementine' Christian Jews regarded Jesus as the last one in a series of 7 It should be noted that in Arabic and in other near Eastern languages, 'Nasoraeans' has become the current designation of all Christians. 8 For the surviving fragments of Christian Jewish Gospels see W. Schneemelcher, N eut estamentlichen Apokryphen I. TÃ¼bingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 5th ed. 1987, pp. 114-147, and A.F.J. Klijn, Jewish Christian Gospel Tradition. Leiden: Brill 1992.</page><page sequence="7">NEOTESTAMENTICA 28(3) 1994 (Special Edition) 225 manifestations of 'the True Prophet' Adam-Christ. Furthermore they believed that the Bible contains 'false peri copes', notably passages affirming the sacrifi- cial cult in Jerusalem. In their view, one of the tasks of the True Prophet was to distinguish these passages from the true pericopes. The so-called Gospel of the Ebionites seems to have originated somewhere among these Christian Jews in Syria. In this Gospel, John the Baptist and Jesus are presented as vegetarians. It states that Jesus came to abolish sacrifices and to replace them by a baptism for the remission of sins. Because of the central place of water rites in their religion (apart from a baptism for the remission of sins, they were familiar with ritual ablutions and exorcism by means of water rites) these Syrian Christian Jews can be designated as baptists. We must assume that the Christian Jewish baptists in Syria were related to the Mesopotamian baptist community in which Mani was reared according to a new sources (the Cologne Mani Codex).9 Also the Elkesaites were related to Christian Jewish baptist communities in Syria. Their name is derived from the name of an esoteric book, 'Elchasai' or 'Elxai'. Apparently the book was called after the (Aramaic) name of an angelic revealer figure, hyl ksy ('hidden power'). Elkesaite missionaries, who were active in the churches of Rome and Palestine in the first half of the third century, combined the message of a new remission of sins contained in their book with the observance of the Jewish law, the rejection of the apostle Paul, and a christology which had some features in common with 'pseudo- Clementine' speculations about the many appearances of Christ. But they also believed in the virgin birth of Jesus. Besides, their teachings contained ele- ments of pagan learning (Hippolytus Ref 9.13-17; cf 10.29; Eus HE 6.38). Obviously we are dealing with a characteristically syncretistic type of Christian Judaism. Finally mention has to be made of the poorly attested existence of Christian Jews in Egypt, more particularly in Alexandria. The most significant traces of this type of Christian Judaism are a few quotations by the Egyptian writers Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind from a document that they designate as the Gospel of the Hebrews. Characteristic of the Christian Jewish ideas of this Gospel is the emphasis on the authority of James, the brother of Jesus. It reports that James was present at Jesus' last supper, and that after his resurrec- tion Jesus appeared first to him. Furthermore this Gospel speaks about the (female) Holy Spirit in a way which is reminiscent of Jewish Wisdom specula- tions. 9 Cf L. Koenen and C. RÃ¶mer, Der KÃ¶lner Mani-Kodex , Opladen: Westdeutscher Verlag 1988, and my study The Revelation ofElchasai , TÃ¼bingen: J.C.B. Mohr 1985, esp pp 153-1 64.</page><page sequence="8">226 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS It will be clear, in conclusion, that diverse forms of Christian or Nasoraean Judaism existed during the first four centuries. Moreover, as we have already seen, the beliefs of these various groups had developed in the course of the centuries. But this does not alter the fact that, in their persistent observance of the law of Moses, they remained true to the Judaism of Jesus and his first fol- lowers. Therefore early Christian Judaism should not be regarded as just a branch of early Christianity. Rather they represented the trunk, while lawfree mainstream Christianity developed from a Pauline side branch. Christian Judaism in its diverse forms had a tragic history. Its right to exist was disputed by rabbinic Judaism as well as by emerging orthodox Christianity. The evidence of the sources suggests that after the fourth century there were no important Christian Jewish communities left. The few reports about Christian Judaism written after the fourth century were not based on direct observations but are all borrowings from earlier sources. 3 EARLY CHRISTIAN GNOSIS It is much more difficult to assess the exact historical relationship between Christianity and Gnosis. One of the main problems lies in the fact that the ear- liest sources (patristic reports, notably in Irenaeus' Adversus Haereses , and authentic Gnostic texts) date from the second half of the second century. There may be reasons to believe that the Gnostic way of thinking originated at an ear- lier time (e g the fact that at the time of the earliest sources several different Gnostic schools of thought already existed). However, in the absence of clear external testimonies we are wholly dependent on internal evidence, which we can only obtain by carefully analysing the second century and later sources. Another problem concerns the definition of 'Gnosis' or 'Gnostics' and the relations between the various schools of thought. It will be clear that we can- not hope to answer the question of whether or not traces of Gnostic thinking can be found in New Testament writings without a workable definition of this phenomenon. At the moment, however, it seems to be premature to give such a broad definition. What still has to be done is to examine the specific features of the individual documents, and then to try to classify the evidence from pri- mary and secondary sources. In this way we will come to a more balanced and realistic picture of the complex and pluriform phenomenon of ancient Gnosis. One of the more promising attempts is the tentative identification of a 4 Sethi an' or 'classic Gnostic' school of thought.10 The main characteristic of 10 Cf H.-M. Schenke, 'Das sethianische System nach Nag-Hammadi-Handschriften', in: P. Nagel (ed), Studia Coptica.

Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures. New York: Doubleday 1987, esp pp5-22.</page><page sequence="9">NEOTEST AMENTICA 28(3) 1994 (Special Edition) 227 this type of Gnosis is a complex and distinctive myth of origins.11 Structural components of the myth are the supramundane divine world with its numerous aeons, the behaviour of Sophia or divine Wisdom, the origin of the material world and its rulers, the creation of the first humans by these cosmic rulers, the early history of mankind, and the enlightenment and eventual redemption of the spiritual descendants of Adam and Seth (the Gnostics or Sethians). In connection with the redemption of the Gnostics reference is made to a baptis- mal rite. As we shall see further below, in the surviving narrations of the myth ample use is made of biblical and post-biblical Jewish stories and motifs. This is particularly true of the sections dealing with the origins of evil, the creation of man and the early history of mankind. The most complete version of this myth of origins is narrated in The Secret Book of John, a writing which can be dated back to the second half of the sec- ond century (Irenaeus gives a summary account of this text in his Iren Haer, written ca 180; three of the Nag Hammadi codices [NHC 2, 3, 4] open with a copy of the Secret Book; it is further included in the Coptic Berlin Codex [BG 2]). Other more or less clear exponents of this type of mythological Gnosis are The Revelation of Adam (NHC 5.5), The Nature of the Archons (NHC 2.4), The Gospel of the Egyptians (NHC 3.2 and 4.2), The Three Tablets of Seth (NHC 7.5), and Trimorphic Protennoia (NHC 13.1). More texts may be added to this list which does not claim to be exhaustive. In several cases, however, the classification with Sethian or classic Gnosis is less easy, in particular when a text contains a very brief or incomplete narration of the Gnostic myth (e g The Letter of Peter to Philip [NHC 8.2], The Letter of Eugnostos [NHC 3.3 and 5.1], The Wisdom of Jesus Christ [NHC 3.4 and BG 3], or where the myth is presupposed rather than actually told (eg in The Revelation of Peter [NHC 7.3]). On the following pages I will concentrate on this type of Gnosis and its connections with early Christianity. The surviving classic Gnostic documents were read and copied by Christians. But it is questionable whether they originated in early Christian circles. Here a comparison with Old Testament apocrypha and pseudepigrapha may be of some help. These writings were read and copied- and thus preserved for later generations- by Christians. Several of them were also adapted by Christian editors in order to bring their contents in more agreement with Christian beliefs. But in their original form the majority of these texts were composed by Jewish writers who were not familiar with Christian views. The comparison does not hold in every respect (I hope to show that Gnostic mythology has a pagan rather than a Jewish origin). But it is my contention 11 B. Lay ton, The Gnostic Scriptures , p9.</page><page sequence="10">228 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS that in both cases we are dealing with literature read and interpreted by early Christians but originating outside the sphere of influence of early Christianity. The following observations may elucidate this. 3.1 The Wisdom of Jesus Christ and The Secret Book of John The Letter of Eugnostos and The Wisdom of Jesus Christ show remarkable agreements as far as their actual teachings are concerned. However, in The Letter of Eugnostos these teachings are presented in a learned philosophical tractate preceded by a formal letter opening, whereas in The Wisdom of Jesus Christ more or less the same teachings are part of a revelation granted by the resurrected Jesus to his twelve apostles and seven women followers. The argument of The Letter of Eugnostos begins with a statement to the effect that, as yet, the wisest among men have explained the world too superfi- cially because they did not realise that behind the visible heaven and earth there is an invisible world of light, where the supreme God dwells. The text continues with an exposition about the ineffable, nameless God and with detailed descriptions of the aeons which emanated from the highest God. Almost the same argument can be found in The Wisdom of Jesus Christ. This text opens with a frame story in which Christ and his disciples figure. It is reported that the twelve apostles and seven women followers had gathered together on the Mount of Olives after the resurrection of Christ while they were in a state of uncertainty about the nature of the Universe and the Saviour's plan of salvation. The Saviour appears on the mountain in the form of a great angel of light and he asks his disciples why they are uncertain. When Philip voices their doubts, the Saviour answers by referring to the explanations about the world by the wisest among men, with which The Letter of Eugnostos begins. After a request from Matthew to teach the truth, expositions follow about the ineffable supreme God and the many aeons which emanated from him. The exposition barely differs from that in The Letter of Eugnostos. It should be noticed dat the revelation discourse in The Wisdom of Jesus Christ is interrupted here and there- sometimes in a rather clumsy manner- by further questions from the apostles and Mary Magdalene.12 The Saviour does not really answer these questions but just resumes his exposition after the inter- ruptions. For this reason we must assume that the frame story and the ques- tions of the disciples are additions to a completed text. This would imply that The Wisdom of Jesus Christ is a Christian re-edition of The Letter of Eug- 12 Cf M. Krause, 'Das literarische VerhÃ¤ltnis des Eugnostosbriefes zur Sophia Jesu Christi', in: Jahrbuch fiir Antike und Christentum , ErgÃ¤nzungsband I. MÃ¼nster: Aschendorff 1964, pp215-223.</page><page sequence="11">NEOTESTAMENTICA 28(3) 1994 (Special Edition) 229 nostos. Below, we will try to answer the question why the teaching of Eug- nostos was presented as a revelation by the resurrected Jesus.13 In The Wisdom of Jesus Christ, the Christian Saviour does not merely fig- ure in the (secondary) frame narrative. In a few passages of the actual revela- tion discourse Christ seems to speak about himself in the first person style (cf Codex III, p 97.22, where the Saviour says: 4 1 have addressed those who are awake', and p 106.5-8: *1 came from Selfbegotten and First Infinite Light in order to reveal everything to you'). Statements like these suggest that the Christian Gnostic editor of the text attempts to identify the Christian Saviour with one of the eternal Light beings, and, furthermore, with the voice or mythical figure who, ever since Adam and Eve, has been bringing gnosis to mankind. The Secret Book of John has basically the same literary structure as The Wisdom of Jesus Christ. It is a revelation discourse encased in a frame narra- tive in which the resurrected Christ appears to John, the apostle. To him Christ reveals the hidden truth about God and the world. Also in this writing an attempt is made to identify Christ with one of the Light beings that emanated from the highest God (cf BG 2, pp 30-35). The Christian Saviour, speaking to John, further reveals that he played a role in the enlightenment of the first human beings: he tells how he had urged Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. By eating from the tree of gnosis they regained knowledge of their origin and true identity (BG 2, pp 57-58). However, else- where in the Secret Book, Christ relates that a female figure, Epinoia ('Insight'), had informed Adam and Eve that by eating from the tree of knowl- edge they would recover their former perfection (BG 2, p 61). Apparently, an attempt has been made to introduce Christ as bringer of revelation into the story about the first humans without Epinoia having to disappear. The comparison between The Letter of Eugnostos and The Wisdom of Jesus Christ, and the somewhat hesitant introduction of the Christian Saviour into the story about Adam and Eve in The Secret Book of John clearly suggest that the earlier stages of the Gnostic mythological teaching did not yet contain references to Jesus and his mission. It is not my intention to discuss the question of whether religious texts which did not refer to the person and the mission of Jesus, could have been composed by Christians. The more pertinent question is: Why did early Christians read and appropriate these mythological stories? And why did they Here, it may suffice to refer to D.M.Parrott's assumption that the Christian editor intended to convert non-Christian Gnostics to Christian Gnosis (Nag Hammadi Codices 111,3-4 and V,l. Leiden: E.J. Brill 1991, p4).</page><page sequence="12">230 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS put these stories into the mouth of Jesus? But first another question with respect to the origin and early development of Gnostic mythology must be con- sidered. 3.2 The use of Jewish texts and traditions by Gnostic mythologisers In the surviving versions of the Gnostic myth of origins ample use is made of the Old Testament, in particular the book Genesis, and of Jewish traditions and narrative motifs. On the other hand, however, many elements of this myth are at odds with Jewish views. By far the most striking feature in this respect is the identification of the biblical creator-God with the ignorant, arrogant and indeed demonic demiurge, called Jaldabaoth, Samael or Saklas, who, in the Gnostic myth, is made responsible for the creation of the dark world in which the Gnostics are forced to live as his prisoners. In accordance with this view of the God of the Old Testament, his commandments are interpreted as means to bind the Gnostics further to the cosmos and to prevent them from reaching their destination in the supramundane world of light. The strong biblical and Jewish component in the Gnostic myth has induced scholars to connect the origin and early development of the myth and, con- sequently, the origin of classic or Sethian Gnosis, directly with a Jewish milieu. Because of the highly critical attitude towards the Jewish God and Jewish scripture it is sometimes argued that the Gnostic mythological thinking and bible interpretation originated somewhere in the periphery of Judaism14. The latter hypothesis, in particular, seems to me to be questionable. There are grounds for looking for a more natural explanation of the critical interpretation of biblical and Jewish traditions in Gnostic mythological texts. Ancient Gnostics were firmly convinced that, as pneumatic or enlightened persons, they had access to the ultimate and full truth about God, the world, and man. But their knowledge of the truth did not prevent them from being interested in all kinds of Gnostic and non-Gnostic religious and philosophical books and traditions. It is important to note, though, that they understood and interpreted heterogeneous texts and ideas in the light of their own preconceived Gnostic systems of thought. Apparently, they were convinced that it is only in a superficial and therefore misleading way that non-Gnostic texts refer to 14 Cf eg G. Quispel, 'Christliche Gnosis und jÃ¼dische Heterodoxie', Evangelische Theologie 14(1954), pp474-84; R.M. Grant, Gnosticism and Early Christianity. New York: Columbia University Press 1959; K.

Their gnosis would grant them entry to the complete truth which was supposedly hidden under the sur- face of the text. Gnostic philosophers therefore felt free to radically review earlier traditions and ideas. At best, the literal text of an earlier piece of work was seen as a symbol of the deeper lying truth, but sometimes rather as a misleading con- cealment of the truth. The result is that in Gnostic documents allegorical explanations can be found which are contrary to the prima facie understanding of the text. In The Secret Book of John such critical interpretations of the book Genesis are preceded by a standard formula: 'It is not as Moses said, but...'. It is plausible to regard the free and critical use of the first chapters of Genesis as an attempt by Gnostic philosophers to integrate the biblical story about the origin of the world and the early history of mankind into an essen- tially different pattern of thought: The Genesis accounts were used- and inter- preted allegorically - to give more detailed expression to a basically pagan philosophical myth. Actually, this explanation gives rise to the question whether the radical revisions, if not perversions, of the first chapters of Genesis were intentionally anti- Jewish at all, and whether it is correct to label this critical (in fact allegorical) interpretation as 'protest exegesis'.15 It would seem that to Gnostic philosophers the story of the creation in Genesis com- bined with the anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to the biblical God was reason enough to identify this God not with their supreme and unknown God but with the lower demiurge of the imperfect world. If this explanation is plausible, we cannot assume that the thought pattern underlying the several versions of the Gnostic myth of origins had developed from Jewish exegetical methods and speculations. Rather, the structure of the myth draws upon philosophical ideas about the origin of the world and mankind which ultimately go back to Plato's creation myth in his Timaeus. Essential to this mythical thought pattern must have been the idea to the effect that the phenomenal world was created by a lower demiurge after prototypes supplied by the noetic or divine world, with the exception, that is, of the human intellect or spirit which was believed to belong to the higher world. On the other hand, it is not difficult to see why Platonist mythmakers took an interest in the biblical stories about the creation of the world and particu- larly in the account of the creation of man after the image and likeness of God. Yet, even after the radical re-interpretation of these biblical stories, elements remain which betray their heterogeneous background. It is plausible, for instance, that the idea of Adam's body being made by the biblical God after a 15 Cf K. Rudolph, art cit (nl4), pi 17.</page><page sequence="14">232 EARLY CHRISTIAN JUDAISM AND GNOSIS divine image (Gn 1:27) appealed to Platonist philosophers. Apparently, they connected this idea with a mythical story to the effect that the supreme God wished to deceive the ignorant demiurge. Yet it remains curious that precisely the material (or, in another version of the Gnostic myth, the psychic) com- ponent of man should bear likeness to the highest God in a myth which stresses that the only God-like element in man is his pneuma .16 3.3 The use of Gnostic myths by early Christians Now we turn to the question why early Christians felt attracted to these mytho- logical stories and their apparent distortions of Old Testament scripture. It must be remembered, first of all, that the early generations of Christian believers may not yet have been familiar with those writings which were to become part of the New Testament, and with other writings that gained author- ity in various Christian communities. Their scriptures were basically the books of the Septuagint and perhaps some Old Testament apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. It is a plausible assumption that some Christians received insights from the esoteric Gnostic teachings which the biblical writings could not possibly offer. We also have to bear in mind that- as we have seen in the first half of this essay - quite early in the development of the Christian movement, there was a strong tendency to separate from the synagogue. This was accompanied by a critical attitude towards the Old Testament scriptures. Suffice it to refer to M arciÃ³n' s rejection of the Jewish scriptures and to the attempt by the author of the Letter of Barnabas to find a deeper meaning in the Old Testament. Inciden- tally, this author designates his deeper understanding of scripture as 'perfect gnosis' , a type of knowledge that allegedly surpasses the simple Christian belief and is accessible only to those who are worthy. It would therefore seem that the free and often negative interpretation of Old Testament texts and ideas in Gnostic mythological writings can hardly have impeded early Christians to read and appropriate these writings. As we have already seen, in the course of time the myth was presented as a revelation by the risen Jesus to his chosen disciples. The reason may simply be that Christian Gnostics were convinced that the full and definitive truth about the divine world of light and the origins of evil was revealed by Jesus Christ (in esoteric teachings directed to a select group of followers). 16 Cf my essay The Jewish Factor in the Development of the Gnostic Myth of Origins: Some Observations', in: T.

This is apparent, for instance, from the interpretation of Jesus' suffering in such texts as The Apocalypse of Peter (NHC 8. 3) 17 and The Letter of Peter to Philip (NHC 8.2). 18 Indeed texts and traditions of all kinds and provenance were used and allegorically interpreted by Gnostics in the light of their privileged knowledge of the truth. Now it is possible to outline the early development of classic mythological Gnosis and to indicate how it was related to early Christianity. The origin and early history of mythological gnosis must be traced back to speculative philosophical circles inspired by Plato's Timaeus. When the basic narrative structure of the myth had developed it was enriched with biblical and post- biblical Jewish stories and narrative motifs, which, however, had been thoroughly revised and fully integrated into a basically non- Jewish mythical thought structure. It was in this form that the myth was adopted by Christians who subsequently presented it as the definitive truth revealed by Jesus Christ. Apparently these early Christians were convinced that the esoteric knowledge contained in the mythological writings surpassed the insights offered by bibli- cal and other non-Gnostic texts. This last observation may enable us to find out how Christian Gnostics defined themselves in relation to (other) early Christians. In all likelihood, they saw themselves as enlightened Christians who had access to the full divine truth. Initially Christian Gnostics and non-Gnostic Christians may well have been members of the same local religious communities and have used the same Christian symbols (scriptural texts, beliefs, worship). In that case it is possible to conceive of these Gnostics as an inner circle (or higher level) of enlightened, esoteric believers in a broader congregation of Christians.19 But Christian Gnostics are liable to have assigned different meanings to these common symbols. For Christian Gnostics, the Christian symbols referred to a spiritual reality which fully transcended all cosmic phenomena. Accor- dingly, Gnostics could blame other Christians for their supposed superficiality: non-enlightened Christians attached meaning to the literal text of biblical 17 Cf H.W.

At the beginning of this essay, I men- tioned that in our discussions Willem and I grew more and more convinced that the study of the reception and the impact of the New Testament is at least as important and relevant as that of its backgrounds and sources. The interest- ing thing is that it was not necessary for us to make an exception for the study of the relation between Gnosis and the New Testament. It is increasingly diffi- cult to maintain Bultmann' s position and to believe that New Testament tradi- tions drew on any recorded form of the Gnostic myth. It is much more promis- ing to look in the opposite direction, and- as Willem proposes in the introduc- tion to his translation of The Letter of Rheginos (NHC 1 .4) - to focus attention on the use of New Testament texts and traditions in Gnostic documents.22 The newly discovered Christian Gnostic writings help us to realise the diversity of thought patterns and the range of biblical interpretations in early Christianity.
