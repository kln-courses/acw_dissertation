Air has been separated off from the earth vaporized because of the latter's stronger compression; the sun is an exhalation of fire and such is the Milky Way. The moon is a mixture of both air and fire. Aether is topmost, surrounding all; beneath it there is that fire-like part which we call sky; beneath it is what surrounds the earth. Since H. Diels it is customary to view the solid in the center of the rings as the earth.7 However, this leads to a serious problem: if the cen- tral solid is the earth, what can the fiery ring said to surround it be? As there is no cosmological reality to which a fiery ring contiguous to the earth can correspond, Aetius' account is declared unreliable.8 I find it difficult to understand why this interpretation, which is dogmatic and raises insuperable difficulties, is still current. The simple fact is that Aetius definitely distinguishes "the rare" (apal6v), i.e., light or fire, "the dense" (rrUKVOV), i.e., darkness or light, and "the solid" (aTEpe6v).9 There is no justification whatever for the identification of "the solid" with "the dense," and it is not surprising that on this identifi- cation the report becomes unintelligible.

It is true that from a purely philological standpoint, the Greek can also be understood as referring to many pairs of alternating un- mixed rings; however, I do not see how, on this interpretation, Aetius' report can purport to provide a picture which somehow agrees with cos- mological reality. The need to excise "around which there is again a fiery [ring]" arises as a direct result of identifying "the solid" with "the dense" and thus it is Taran, and not Aetius, who is responsible for the first of the difficulties. As to the second difficulty, two and a half lines lacking a broader context and not even grammatically self-contained cannot prove anything "beyond doubt." For this reason I think it would 'iTaran (note 8 above) 236. 305</page><page sequence="4">ARYEH FINKELBERG be wisest to set aside fr. 12 until we have tried to understand what Aetius tells us. It may well prove that the criticism of Aetius' reliability was premature. Aetius proceeds: What surrounds them all [i.e., the rings of the rare, of the dense, and of the mixture of both] like a wall is solid, beneath which there is a fiery ring, and what is in the middle of all rings is (solid) around which there is again a fiery [sc. ring]. We must now supplement our diagram with the solid peripheral "shell" and the solid center surrounded with a fiery ring: y^^ fire the solid 'shell' the mixed rings fire the solid center This, according to Aetius, is the Parmenidean system of cosmic rings.

A trustworthy doxographic tradition attributes to Parmenides the conception of a spherical earth in the center of the universe.12 Taken "Morrison's proposed mixed rings beneath the earth are not found in Aetius' re- port; the attempt to find them in the corrupt sentence referring to the goddess is philo- logically not felicitous.

This enables us to make further identifications: 1) the ring of fire which surrounds the solid center and is surrounded by the spherical earth is the subterranean fire; 2) the ring of pure fire beneath the solid "shell" of the world is the heavenly aether; and 3) the rings of mixed light and darkness between the heavenly aether and the earth correspond to the atmosphere: the solid 'shell' the heavenly aether the atmosphere the earth the subterranean fire the solid center This seems to be a perfectly intelligible system consistent with cos- mological reality and reflecting the specifically Italian experience of the earth's volcanic activity.14 The cosmological meaning of the Parmenidean rings is reflected in the way in which Aetius accounts for them. The report seems to be set forth illogically, for instead of following the order of the Parmenidean l:Morrison's reconstruction, magnificent as it is (Guthrie, i 62, n. 3), falls along with his notion of the flat earth in Parmenides upon which, as he himself points out (note 7 above, p. 64), it is based.

Empedocles, fr. 52 and 54; Pythagorean analogies are aptly adduced by Morrison (note 7 above) 65. 307</page><page sequence="6">ARYEH FINKELBERG rings, Aetius begins with the rings of light and of darkness, says that between them there are mixed rings and then mentions the two "solids": that which surrounds the ring of light and that which is surrounded by a previously unmentioned ring of light in the center of the system. How- ever, when the cosmological counterparts of the rings are identified, the report displays a certain logic. Aetius approaches the Parmenidean rings from the standpoint of conventional cosmology: he first accounts for Parmenides' conception of the visible world -heaven, earth and the atmosphere between them, and only afterwards mentions two Parme- nidean "peculiarities" -the "shell" beyond the visible sky and the solid center surrounded by fire beneath the earth. II The question we must now turn to is whether the system described by Aetius is compatible with fr. 12. The narrower [sc. rings] were filled with unmixed fire, and those next to them with night, and into them / after them / between them a portion of fire is brought; in the middle of these rings is the goddess . . . ' The presence of solitary article and an adjective with no name makes it clear that this fragment was a part of a more extensive pas- sage--at least by a few lines - dealing with the cosmic system. This in itself is sufficient to undermine the contention that fr. 12 is the only source of Aetius' report.'6 On the contrary, the fact that neither the solid "shell" nor the solid center are mentioned here necessitates the conclusion that these lines constitute only a fragment of the system which Aetius is presumably describing, a supposition which must now be investigated. The words 0PTQc 65 (Aoyo6q ieTaT aloa in fr. 122 can be understood in the following three ways: (a) next to rings of fire there are mixed rings; (b) after rings of fire come rings of night and after them there is mixture of fire and night; (c) between rings of fire and night there is mixture. These options can be represented as follows (here I am ab- ';ai yap oTiLvoTESpa nArVTo rrupo6 aKprlTOlo, ai 6' eni TaCt VUKTO6, pCITI 65 qAoy6c iSTat aioa' sv 65 pIo(a TOUOTCV 15aip)v KTA.

For if rings made of the same material are contiguous, i.e., are not separated by rings of another kind, what makes them separate rings rather than a single thick band? (This problem does not necessarily arise in the case of mixed rings, which may differ in the ratio of their respective components.) Now, without trying to reconstruct Parmenides' reasons for speaking of sev- eral contiguous rings of the same kind, one can still agree that for the 309</page><page sequence="8">ARYEH FINKELBERG purpose of simplification it is possible to describe contiguous rings of the same substance as single rings, as in Aetius where only the mixed rings are contiguous, while there are no contiguous rings of pure fire or pure night. Having thus reconciled the problem of the discrepancy between the single rings of fire and night in Aetius and the unspecified plurality of such rings in fr. 12, we can turn to the main problem concerning the relation between the description found in fr. 121_2 and Aetius' account. The following diagram shows that fr. 12, under each of its three possible interpretations (see the last diagram), constitutes a fragment of the sys- tem described in Aitius: the solid 'shell' Thus, there is no conflict between fr. 121 3, and the account of Aetius and no reason to call the reliability of the latter into question. The choice between the three possible interpretations of the frag- ment has nothing to do with reconstructing the Parmenidean system of cosmic rings and is in fact a separate task, namely, reconstruction of the broader context of the extant lines of Parmenides. Obviously, here we can do no better than conjecture. The main factor determining our choice between the alternative interpretations of fr. 121 3 is the location of the goddess, itself a contro- versial problem. The expression ev d5e po.c TOUTODV in fr. 123 may mean either "in the center of the rings" or "between the rings" (though 310</page><page sequence="9">THE COSMOLOGY OF PARMENIDES it seems to me that since concentric rings are being referred to the former is more natural).17 The other sources for the goddess' location are Simplicius, who definitely asserts that the goddess is in the center of the world,18 and the above account of Aetius, in which the goddess is said to be the middlemost of the mixed rings. This contradiction seems to force us to choose between the authorities of Simplicius19 and Theophrastus, who is presumably Aetius' source.20 But in fact the choice is not between Simplicius and Theophrastus, but between Sim- plicius and a corrupt sentence in the over-condensed excerpt from Theophrastus, which is missing two words. However, the corruption may go deeper than the mere loss of two words, as is indicated by the fact that already in the previous sentence (Tespe6v) must be supplied and the relative pronoun emended; the discrepancy with Simplicius' in- formation shows that indeed the corruption is much more serious.21 If placed in the center of the world the goddess is identical with either the solid or the fiery ring surrounding it.22 The latter identifica- tion is supported by Aetius' reference to the goddess as a ring. And in- deed, if Parmenides wished to personify fire in an anthropomorphic im- age, he would use a feminine one, for he believed that the female is hotter than the male,23 and hence a feminine image was more suitable for representing the hot principle. Let us examine each of the three ren- derings of the fragment on the assumption that the goddess is the center fiery ring. On the interpretation (a), fr. 121 3 seems to aim at specifying the location of the goddess. Now the most natural way to single out one of a number of concentric rings is to mention the ring(s) closest to it. If the `Cf. Diels, Parmenides' Lehrgedicht (Berlin 1897) 107. '8Simpl.

Interpretation (b) appears to provide a list of concentric rings from center to periphery. But it seems odd to begin with the center ring without specifying it as such, to end the enumeration at the next-to-last ring, and to declare the first ring to be the central one. To provide a list of concentric rings from periphery to center, it would be logical to begin with the outermost ring and end with the cen- ter one, specifying it as such. This is precisely what we have with inter- pretation (c), for on the assumption that the goddess is the center ring of fire, the expression "in the center of these rings is the goddess" amounts to "in the center of these rings is the fiery ring."24 On this interpretation fr. 12 is exactly parallel to Aetius' account (from periphery to center: fire-mixture -night--fire) except for one point: in the extant lines of Parmenides neither the solid "shell" nor the solid center of the world are mentioned. We can therefore conclude that in the preceding lines both "solids" were described. I would suggest that Parmenides begins his explanation of the arrangement of the universe with its solid center (it seems natural to begin with such a cornerstone of the system), preceeds to its solid "shell" (thus delineating the solid boundaries of the world) and then, passing from the peripheral solid to the fiery ring beneath it,25 he lists the interior rings until the innermost ' 'Mention of the mixture after the more central ring(s) of night have been referred to may seem to be a deviation from a realistic order of enumeration. But since the mix- ture appears here not as rings but as a region where fire from the preceding ring(s) pene- trates the night of the following ring(s), that is, as a mere border area between fire and night, it is quite natural for the mixture to be referred to after both types of rings have been mentioned. In view of this, it may well be that the Parmenidean "mixed rings" are no more than the doxographic description of the region where the peripheral ring of fire and the ring of night meet. This can explain how these rings of fire and night are said to be "wound one around the other" and at the same time described as separated by interja- cent rings of mixture. In Parmenides (note 15 above) what corresponds to Aetius' mixed rings appears as puTa 6s tAoyoq iSTal aioa, i.e. as an addition of fire to night. This strongly suggests that what is rendered in Aetius as mixed rings was actually envisaged by Parmenides as fusion of fire and night found in the area where the rings of pure fire and pure night meet, and this is precisely the reason why these rings are called "wound one around the other." -'And hence "narrower" in fr. 12, should be understood as implying a comparison with the diameter of the peripheral solid.

The moon is a mixture of both air and fire. Aether is top- most, surrounding all; beneath it there is fire-like part which we call sky; beneath it is what lies around the earth. The last sentence suggests the following stratification: AETHER SKY 'WHAT LIES AROUND THE EARTH' The strata seem to correspond to the peripheral solid, the ring of fire beneath it, and the mixed rings, respectively. This identification is also suggested by the resemblance between the description of the pe- ripheral solid as surrounding all like a wall, having a fiery ring beneath it and the description of the aether as topmost, surrounding all, and having the fire-like region called sky beneath it. What Aetius accounts for in the lines quoted above is the Parme- nidean meteorology. But we must recall that Aetius' approach is tran- scendent and he dissociates the sky from its "shell"; hence in this ac- count of the sky and the heavenly bodies he may well choose not to 'We can now concur with Frankel (note 16 above) 183 that Aetius paraphrases fr. 12, while still denying that he paraphrases only fr. 12, and of course, that he does so incorrectly. "7In my reconstruction I consciously avoid referring to the Proem (fr. 1), for the controversies involved are not, in my opinion, worth the information on our subject which can be drawn from it. For a review of current approaches to the Proem see Pelli- kaan-Engel (note 22 above) 63-78. 313</page><page sequence="12">ARYEH FINKELBERG mention this "shell." And indeed, Cicero's report makes it clear that the aether is not identical with the peripheral solid:28 Parmenides . . . makes a crown-like ring containing fire (he calls it OTs- &lt;)dvrl) which surrounds the sky and which he calls god. That the fiery ring spoken of here corresponds to Aetius' aether is clear both from Cicero's use of the word ardores29 and from the fact that like the aether in Aetius, the fiery ring in Cicero encircles the sky. But Cicero specifies that Parmenides called the aether a "ring" and hence the aether is not the solid which encircles the system of the rings but is itself one of the rings, namely, the fiery one beneath the solid periphery. It follows that Aetius' reference to the aether as "topmost, surrounding all" does not mean more than that aether forms the outermost ring of the sky, precisely as in fr. 105 the sky which is itself embraced by the aether and the solid "shell" is nevertheless said to "embrace all." From the passages from Aetius and Cicero quoted above it emerges that Parmenides draws a distinction between the aether and the sky, and this distinction is implied in fr. 10:30 And you will know the nature of the aether and all the marks in the ae- ther and the invisible:' works of the pure torch of the shining sun, and 2"Cic.

According to this report, the sun comes immediately after the ring of pure fire, the aether; below it, in the region Parmenides calls "sky," are the stars.36 The fact that the moon is not mentioned here indicates that it is not found in the "sky" and hence must be located beneath it in the region defined by Aetius as "what lies around the earth." This fits in with the moon's being a mixture of fire and air, unlike the sun and stars, '"In addition to the passage under consideration, see also ii 15.4 (DK 28 A 40a). :Elsewhere (ii 20.8a; iii 1,4; DK 28 A 43, 43a) Aetius asserts that the Milky Way in Parmenides is a mixture.

Parmenides presumably recognized three kinds of mixed things: air, moisture,38 and organic bodies.39 Obviously, the region adjoining the earth must include all three kinds of mixed bodies. If we ascend, organic bodies vanish, but not moisture, which is found in the form of exhalations, vapors, clouds, and so on. Here we must have a ring filled with air and moisture. Ascending still further, moisture will gradually vanish and an admixture of fire will appear in the air; at this point the moon is nearby. As we proceed, a greater amount of fire is present and we find ourselves in the fire-like region where the stars are found and on the upper border of which is the sun, a sort of emanation from the pure fire or aether which fills the next region.4? It is impossible and unnecessary to try to determine the precise number and exact limits of the mixed rings.

But Frankel's identification of "the solid" with "the dense" confuses the picture: taking the peripheral solid as "pure night," Frankel wonders "what drove this heavy material into the utmost heights?" (ibid., 185, n. 1). "It is now obvious that the Parmenidean "rings" are in fact spheres, namely, spherical layers or "shells" surrounding the spherical earth. Cf. Frankel (note 16 above) 184; R.

In fact, using aoaipa as hollow sphere is firmly attested to by the fourth century B.c., but it may well be that in the early fifth century to say "there are cqaLpoa in succession, one around the other" would sound as puzzling as "there are balls in succession, one around the other." 316</page><page sequence="15">THE COSMOLOGY OF PARMENIDES 317 The results of the reconstruction of the Parmenidean cosmology are summarized in the following diagram: the uttermost Olympos the heavenly aether the sun stars in air / the moon ARYEH FINKELBERG 'I 11'; II3RI.;\\ UNI\'VERSITY 01F JERLUSAI.E\M</page></plain_text>
