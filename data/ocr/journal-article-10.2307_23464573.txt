The small hook brings some of the first results (a kind of prolegomena) of the author's complex study of Athenian vases and their iconography. It shows ideas and deep insight into an immense iconographie corpus, coliected and arran ged for other purposes by the late Sir John Beazley. As against many „metho dically pure" works dealing with spécifie détails rather mechanically, the author views the problems from various angles, and in the context of Greek civilisation as a whole: this has enabled him to un derstand the problems more deeply than most of his predecessors. Ch. 1 [Homeric gold and Athenian pot tery) deals with the role played by Athe nian fine pottery: iike Homeric keimélia, tbey represented their holders on festival occasions, they were kept hidden and oniy used at symposiums. This sounds correct, but it probably is not the sole aspect. They tvere not exhibited ali the time (the décoration of household inte riors became popular only after the 5th century), but we also keep most of four family silverware and crystal glasses loc ked away as in the Xenophon's times. The décoration of evervthing which surroun ded human beings with anthropomorphic art was considered necessary by ancient Greeks, and symposiums were the cen tres of Greek social life. Metal vases we re hardly es excpetional as is supposed: ali pottery shapes imitate them. They are nearly absent among Greek finds, but not only the Vix krater, also the best painted vases were discovered outside proper Greece. Ch. 2 (Ideality of scenes of reality) also takes us forward. The modem dicho tomy between religious and secular did not exist, there was no strict boundary between mythical and reality scenes and both show an adhérence to iconographie 184</page><page sequence="2">REFERÁTY rules.
