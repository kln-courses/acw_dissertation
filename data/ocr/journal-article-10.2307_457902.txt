<plain_text><page sequence="1">XXXII SPENSER'S "MUTABILITIE" SEVERAL recent articles have called attention once more to the problems presented by Spenser's Mutabilitie. Two of them, by Ronald B. Levinson' and Evelyn May Albright,2 deal with certain portions of a series of three essays which I published several years ago,3 and concern Spenser's use of materials drawn from various sources on the general subject of what Mr. Grierson has called meta- physical poetry. Three others, by Miss Albright,4 H. M. Belden,5 and by Miss Albright in reply to Mr. Belden,6 raise questions concern- ing the dating of the poem and its relation to Harvey's criticism of the first draft of the Faerie Queene. Since with the single exception of the problem of historical allegory, no topic in Spenser criticism is of comparable interest just now, it is important to review the present state of the inquiry and to consider what remains to be done. I Mr. Levinson is perturbed over the presence of Lucretian elements in the work of a poet who was fundamentally a Platonist. He speaks of his desire to save Spenser from a "charge of inconsistency too gross even for poetic license to condone," of the "appalling incongruity" between the Platonic elements in the Garden of Adonis passage and the Lucretian materialism which I have pointed out, and which he agrees is present. He is no better pleased with the similar combination of Lucretius and the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian cosmogony of Mutabilitie, and calls upon the name of historicity, whatever that muse may be, to preserve some distinction between Aristotle and Epicurus. Now the answer to this is very short, but it is decisive. The appalling incongruity, the jarring opposition, is purely a figment of Mr. Levinson's imagination. Every student of Spenser is aware of his practice of combining in a single passage matters drawn from widely different sources. It is part of his theory of his art, and part 1"Spenser and Bruno," PMLA XLIII, 675. 2Spenser's Cosmic Philosophy and his Religion," PMLA XLIV, 715.

It is, moreover, characteristic of the Renaissance-this combining, this building up of learning through ma- terials drawn from many sources. Sometimes the practice led to combinations far more paradoxical than this one that pains Mr. Levinson, as in Bacon, for example. 'Mr. Levinson appeals in the name of historicity against the view that Spenser would use a Ptolemaic-Aristotelian cosmogony in combination with Lucretian theories of chaos, the void, the infinite inane and ruining atoms. Let Mr. Levinson, then, explain how it is that Milton does precisely this thing in the second book of Paradise Lost. Mr. Levinson's main contention is thus reduced to absurdity. It remains to inquire as to the validity of the case he has made out for the influence of Bruno on Spenser. The first impression is that he has spoiled a good subject by his method of approach. For in his anxiety to free Spenser from the suspicion of appalling inconsistency he seeks to put the blame upon Bruno. Spenser, he says, would not have been guilty of combining, for example in the Adonis passage, Lucretian materialism with Platonic idealism. But Bruno did this, therefore Spenser must have been getting it from Bruno. One may remark in passing that it is difficult to see why Spenser is blameworthy if he made the combination himself, but is free from blame if he lifted it from another. But let us see what positive evidence is brought forth. Mr. Levinson acknowledges that he has no proof of Spenser's knowledge of Bruno, but insists that the two have much in common. This is true, as I recognized in the first of the three articles which Mr. Levinson is presumably passing under review, where I pointed out several specific instances of analogy which Mr. Levinson might have used to strengthen his case. His single point, so far as the Adonis matter is concerned, turns upon the interpretation of the word "sub- stance." Mr. Levinson remarks that this word is not used by Lucre- tius, that it is not equivalent to the Lucretian atom, but that it im- plies spiritual, not material values. He cites a passage from the Spaccio in which Bruno uses the word "substance" with this signifi- cance in setting forth his understanding of change. The passage is an interesting analogue, but it derives, as Mr. Levinson confesses, un- questionably from Lucretius. Does it, then, have superior authority to the Lucretian passage which I cited, especially in view of the fact that we know that Spenser was acquainted with Lucretius and we do not know whether or not he ever read this or any other work of Bruno's? Moreover, Bruno himself uses the word, in various places 685</page><page sequence="3">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" in his works, with either meaning, evidently deriving his ideas from Lucretius. That is, both meanings are possible in Lucretius himself. Thus, I have already cited several reasons for equating Spenser's "substance" with the Lucretian "first beginnings," citing Munro's note on I. 55. The words in the passage which I believe Spenser was using, II. 1002-1003, are materiai corpora. On this see Munro's note on the passage 991-1022, in which while he argues that in his judg- ment Lucretius is sufficiently Epicurean, that the passage is thorough- ly materialistic, he nevertheless cites Zeller to the effect that here both Epicurus and Lucretius show belief in a divine origin of the human race, and also cites Lactantius, who taxes Lucretius with incon- sistency. But these are experts; the testimony shows honest differ- ence of opinion among professed scholars from the time of the early commentators to the present day. Does Mr. Levinson, then, suppose that Spenser was sufficiently an expert to distinguish such subtle shades of meaning? Why, then, this pother about Spenser's seeming inconsistency, or the feeling that to condone his fault we must have recourse to Bruno? It is thus apparent that Mr. Levinson's purpose, in his postulation of Brunonian influence, is to explain a quite needless feeling of incon- sistency in Spenser's thinking. We are the more aware of this as we pass to his discussion of Mutabilitie. He apparently accepts Mr. Elton's suggestion that Mutabilitie derives from Bruno's Spaccio, but he neither takes into account the extremely slender grounds for such an assumption nor adds anything of importance to what Mr. Elton pointed out. As the matter is of some importance, let us get the record straight. Mr. Elton, following an earlier suggestion of Mr. T. Whittaker, thinks that Spenser may have heard of, or seen, Bruno's work through Sidney. He holds that there are certain correspondences in theme, such as the conclave of the gods, the dealing with certain large con- ceptions of change and recurrence, while Spenser's final reconcilia- tion of the problem might have been found in Bruno's Eroici Furori. Now it is worth noting that this suggestion comes in an essay of some length in which Mr. Elton's subject is the life of Bruno in England, that it is made tentatively, and that it is very evidently not based on a serious study of Mutabilitie. Furthermore, all that Mr. Elton dis- cusses in other parts of his paper militates against such a conclu- sion. Thus, he agrees that Bruno apparently had no influence on the Sidney group, or, indeed, on English thought of the period; that 686</page><page sequence="4">Edwin Greenlaw his philosophy was incoherent and difficult to understand, apart from certain conventional Platonic elements. He thinks that there may in- deed have been some "celestial thieving" such as we find in Spenser's taking over certain passages from Tasso, but this does not take into account the fact that Tasso, an epic poet, was one of Spenser's poetic models; no such impulse obtained in the case of Bruno. But Mr. Elton agrees that Bruno's system was not coherent, that his style was utterly foreign to anything known in England, except perhaps the style of Nashe, that he did not speak English, and that the distinctive features of his thought could not have been understood by his hosts. Thus it is apparent that a very large burden of proof must rest upon any one who maintains direct influence of the Spaccio upon Spenser's poem. If we turn to the Spaccio itself, we see at once the great difficulties. Every one of the points that Mr. Elton names as possible points of contact is a commonplace: the assembly of the gods, the large treatment of cosmic matters, the conclusion. More- over, there is no correspondence between Spenser's theme and Bruno's. In Bruno, Jove is old, remorseful, fearing dissolution; he wants the signs of the amours of the gods taken from the constellations. Bruno's setting, his story, are used only to give means for his attack on anthropomorphism and his satire on the vices of the time. One has only to compare the combination of Lucretius and Alanus de In- sulis as sources supplying the whole frame of Spenser's story, with the conventional application of the attempt of the Titans on the gods, in order to be sure that whatever the soundness or the unsound- ness of my contention, certainly Bruno must be ruled out of account. If we turn, then, to Mr. Levinson's positive suggestions, we shall find only two points. First, he thinks that the Titaness of Spenser is like the Fortuna of Bruno, who asked for the place in the heavens left vacant by the expulsion of the Great Bear. But Fortuna is a very different divinity, and she is after a very different thing. His second point is that the verdict, that all things seek their perfection by change, the conception of a cycle of alteration, is found in the Spac- cio. Mr. Elton, as I remarked a moment ago, found it in Eroici Furori, but remarks that the idea is very old. I related it to the Platonic Great Year. The point is that while Spenser might have read it in one or another of the passages in Bruno, the idea was thoroughly conventional, and moreover that it is precisely the one idea that Spenser must have used in order to bring his poem to an orthodox, or seemingly orthodox conclusion. 687</page><page sequence="5">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" Mr. Levinson, then, has added nothing of value to our knowledge of the possible relations between Spenser and Bruno, in spite of the fact that there are matters of great importance in a complete and scholarly study of Bruno's thought, particularly as expressed in the works printed in England. The method of source study is not to try to find, in isolation, passages that resemble each other in the works of different writers. Much more fundamental matters are involved. If Mr. Levinson had considered some of these matters, he would not have misrepresented my position as he has done throughout his article, and particularly in his concluding paragraph. And he would not then have disregarded the third in the series of essays, with the summary which I have there printed.7 II Miss Albright is quite unnecesssarily perturbed over the fear lest Spenser be accused of atheism. Her long article is repetitious and a little incoherent, but so far as it has any thesis it is that to admit any Lucretian influence in Spenser would be tantamount to accusing him of seeking to overthrow revealed religion. She thinks, or at least she says, not once but many times, that there is no possibility of har- monizing such divergent beliefs in the soul of a poet who is sane. And she reaches a climax in the statement that to brand a sixteenth century Englishman with atheism is a serious stigma. What naive and romantic ideas she must entertain of sixteenth century English gentlemen! I have no intention of being led into what the Autocrat once called "the hydrostatic paradox of controversy," which he explained through saying that if you have a bent tube, one arm of which was the size of a pipestem and the other big enough to hold the ocean, water would stand at the same height in both. I will content myself with a flat denial either that I intended to present Spenser as an atheist or that any such construction can legitimately be placed on what I wrote. I suspect that Miss Albright does not take sufficiently into account the difference between atheism and scepticism. Even scepti- cism I have not postulated in Spenser's case, except in the Erasmian sense of intellectual curiosity. I was discussing, in the paper to which Miss Albright gives most attention, two passages in Spenser's poetry, not the whole body of his poetry, and in these two passages the pres- 7SP XX, 240. 688</page><page sequence="6">Edwin Greenlaw ence, among other things, of elements which I believe to be derived directly from Spenser's reading of Lucretius. It is not logical argu- ment to set over against these passages testimony from Daphnaida, the Hymnes, and the Calender to prove that Spenser expressed re- ligious faith, or to hold that because he used certain Lucretian ele- ments in certain portions of his work he was therefore a believer in the whole system of Lucretius, or wrote from the same purpose. With this, I am willing to let the record stand. I see no reason, in anything that Miss Albright has brought forward, that would neces- sitate revising my original statement of the problems of Lucretian in- fluence. She offers no other source for the matters which I discuss; her attempt to shift the emphasis on sources to Empedocles is beside the point, for the doctrine of the four elements was an Elizabethan commonplace, not to be traced to any one source in Spenser any more than in Chaucer, Shakespeare, or Milton. I may comment briefly on one aspect of her misunderstanding of the problem because it is characteristic, both of her methods and of her reasoning. She re- marks (p. 719): "Astonishingly enough, Professor Greenlaw is willing to make Spenser an atomist, 'almost as much a materialist as Lu- cretius,' a denier of the immortality of the soul, and of the Creatorl" This remarkable sentence is followed immediately by a quotation from my essay in which I describe the chief characteristics of the Lucretian philosophy, opposite in nearly every respect from the Platonic philos- ophy, and ready to establish fruitful contacts, in the period immedi- ately following Spenser, with the new science. Now the first of her statements refers not to any interpretation by me of the whole body of Spenser's work, but to a specific passage on pages 449 and following of my article, in which I show Spenser's use of the conception of chaos, of the constant replenishment of the world through "substances" like the Lucretian first bodies. Into this she injects, in quotation marks but without page reference, a misquotation of my words on page 445, about another point, in which I speak of a single passage in FQ which passes from a Platonic conception of the origin of souls to certain details as materialistic as those found in Lucretius. And the long quotation which she uses as a basis for the remainder of her paragraph comes from the second paragraph of my article (p. 439), in which I am giving, as a general introduction, some of the characteristics of the Lucretian philosophy as a whole, setting it over against Platonism, and proposing, as the body of my discussion, to show that this philosophy also, along with Platonism, "formed another element in 689</page><page sequence="7">690 Spenser's "Mutabilitie" the range of his [Spenser's] interests." Thus her argument proceeds by taking selected passages from three different portions of a closely knit exposition, misquoting in detail, and combining the whole in such a way as to give an impression wholly misleading.8 I am unwilling to pursue further this aspect of the case. In a foot- note I have listed some of the more glaring among other cases of similar distortion or misinterpretation, which those interested in the matter may follow up. Let us put the most charitable construction that is possible. It would be, I take it, that Miss Albright is convinced that any admission of interest on Spenser's part in the Lucretian phil- osophy, or any poetic use he made of portions of it, would necessi- tate our believing that he broke with his Platonic faith or that it would 8 Examples of this distortion are too numerous to cite. The curious reader, however, may compare with what I say such of Miss Albright's ideas as the following: 1. That I hold Spenser's gods (i.e. his personal religious faith) to be like those of Lucretius. 2. To imagine Lucretius praying the great Sabaoth God for rest (where the implication is that my evidence is intended to convey the impression that Spenser had become a disciple of Lucretius in his personal religious view). 3. That I seek to show that Spenser, like Lucretius, aims to overthrow superstition based on ignorance and that this involves also the assumption that Spenser adopted the beliefs of Lucretius on personal immortality. What is really at issue in the passage from my essay (page 461) from which she here quotes is that there is a difference between Lu- cretius and Ovid in theories of change; she does not quote my statement on page 462 which is vital to my argument. 4. Her repeated assumption that I identify Mutability, the adversary of Jove, with Spenser; e.g. "Here, as usual, Mr. Greenlaw attributes to Spenser allegiance to the materialistic Mutability." Now as Miss Albright very well knows, "Spenser" in such passages is a short- hand reference to the way in which an incident or an idea is handled by the poet in a particular passage, not to his theology. 5. "Mr. Greenlaw does not notice that God is in the Garden" (an idea which is an obsession with her, for she refers to it three times). If she will look at the passage in Spenser she will see that God is not in the Garden, having departed. But this is a mere quibble; she may restore God to her Garden, if she desires, without in any way affecting the argument, which is that the description of the Garden contains elements taken from Lucretius. 6. The impossibility of harmonizing these beliefs (they are not beliefs, but facts) in the mind of a poet who is sane. But the materialistic belief, once more, is Mutability's. 7. "Mr. Greenlaw charges that Spenser like Lucretius aimed to depose God as creator and ruler of men." But this is the argument of the poem; specifically, the argument of Mutability the Titaness; it has nothing to do with Spenser's, religion. 8. After referring to the concluding prayer of Spenser's poem: "This is the poem which according to Mr. Greenlaw was designed to unseat God from his throne." Comment is superfluous. Other illustrations could be given, were it worth while.</page><page sequence="8">Edwin Greenlaw illustrate a confusion of mind appalling to contemplate in the case of a poet who is sane. Let us examine this position for a moment. I pass over such elementary and well known facts that just such com- binations, from all sorts of sources, are of the essence of Spenser's method; that even in his philosophical method he resembled his mas- ter Plato in making such combinations; that he was in no sense a systematic philosopher. These facts alone dispose of Miss Albright's thesis, as they dispose of Mr. Levinson's. But in order to show, with no possibility of quibble or evasion, that such a thesis is untenable even in the case of a much more systematically minded poet, let us con- sider the case of Paradise Lost. Paradise Lost is based, ultimately, on Genesis. But Milton, in his cosmogony, goes far beyond the biblical account. In the second book, for example, we find a cosmogony as definite as Dante's, though wholly different. Dante's universe, Ptolemaic-Aristotelian, is closed, com- plete, systematic. There are the circles of Hell, the circles of Purgatory rising to the first sphere of the Ptolemaic universe, the succession of spheres enclosing the earth, the Empyrean, possibly unlimited in extent, which is the highest heaven. There is no place for chaos, or for replenishment of substances, or for anything remotely resembling the Lucretian cosmogony. With Milton we come upon a completely different series of conceptions: a world created out of chaos, against which the strife of the elements and of the atoms goes on unceasingly. Milton tells us that this world, or created universe, may one day sink back into the chaos from which it sprang, which is exactly the view of Lucretius. In Milton's chaos, as in that of Lucretius, we have the strife of the elements, the strife of the atoms also, ruled by chance, swirling about, forming momentary clusters, Chance being the ruler of all. That is, we find in Milton not only Genesis and the four elements of the old physics, both of them matters of convention, but also a strong infusion of material taken either directly from Lucretius or from a source ultimately Lucretian. All this is fused through the poet's imagination into a consistent and vivid conception of the world and of the chaos outside the world. Ptolemy, Plato, Lucretius, the Bible, are all combined. But does it produce in us any sense of a poet whose mind is not sane? Or of hopeless inconsistency? Or of atheism? Other illustrations could be given which, like this one, dispose of Miss Albright's extraordinary thesis, but it is not necessary. I have spoken of her article as incoherent and repetitious. It is in the sum- 691</page><page sequence="9">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" mary of an essay that we find, if anywhere, what the writer is really seeking to expound. Miss Albright's summary is illuminating. There are ten points. Several of these rest on misconceptions of Lucretius, such as the statement that the elements find no place in Lucretius; they do. Or the statement that Lucretius has no place for love and strife in conflict; he does. Or that the one modem note in Lucretius is the doctrine of the survival of the fittest; Munro says, on the con- trary, that this is not certainly in Lucretius, and that the modern note, as everyone recognizes, is his conception of the atoms and his general spirit of scepticism. That Spenser uses the theory of the ele- ments is true, is a commonplace of the time, involves no contradiction, is probably ultimately from Empedocles, though Miss Albright has given no proof that Spenser read Empedocles, or that he could read the fragments, or that there was the slightest reason why he should have found it necessary to read the fragments in order to get from them what was the common belief of his time. And the climax of her summary is that since Lucretius denies God as creator, and Spenser believes, therefore Spenser could not have used Lucretius, for to quote Miss Albright finally and completely, "Lucretius has no heaven; Spenser has!" Since, then, Miss Albright is attacking a position which I never suggested, and since in order to do this she has misrepresented and distorted the evidence, it follows that her testimony is to be thrown out of court as irrelevant. But I do wish, in order that further in- vestigation may proceed upon what seems to me to be the only sound basis, to call attention very briefly to some points of importance. We may assume, I think, that the ultimate critical problem takes two forms. The first of these is the necessity of studying not Spen- ser alone but the whole subject of nature philosophy in Renaissance literature, and, more specifically, the relation of certain aspects of this philosophy to the period beginning at the end of the sixteenth century in England and proceeding down to say the end of the seventeenth century. I have pointed out, in a paper on English poetry and the new science in the seventeenth century,9 some aspects of this subject, and much work is now under way on certain phases. Other illustrations are in the interest which Shakespeare undoubtedly took in the matter, notably in Troilus and Lear; in the relations to Du Bartas; in the relations of growing materialism and scepticism as 9 The Johns Hopkins Alumni Magazine, June, 1925. 692</page><page sequence="10">Edwin Greenlaw 693 part of the disillusion that crept into English thought in the 1590's and later. I have suggested that the presence of so much of this naturalistic material in Spenser may indicate a range of interests similar to that which was to produce the new scientific movement, but I said that such a generalization is dangerous and that I do not wish to press it, or even to affirm it until we have further evidence. What is certain is the presence of this matter, and its presence through a considerable part of Spenser's major work. My only purpose has been to show this fact and to isolate some of the material for examina- tion. Much of it, like the four elements material, is certainly con- ventional, and it may be that even the conception of chaos, the atomic matter, or the peculiar nature mysticism which I have related to Alanus de Insulis, belong to a wider circle of literary works than I have recognized. The question of source, therefore, must as always proceed carefully in the attempt to distinguish between conventional ideas and that which by reason of direct translation or close following of topics in an original gives ground for supposing that Spenser had Lucretius or Alanus before him. But the question of precise source is subordinate here as always to the recognition of the material and its significance. We are thus in possession of a certain body of facts. These may be added to, or the sources of Spenser's information may be enlarged or corrected, but there can be no gainsaying of the facts. The question then becomes, so far as Spenser is concerned, one of interpretation and appraisal. I have time here for but a single illustration. The most perplexing problem in the interpretation of Mutabilitie as an expression of Spenser's own thought is presented by the two stanzas that con- stitute all of the eighth canto that has come down to us. If we did not have these stanzas, we should look upon the poem simply as a case of imitation of that cosmical, that astronomical poetry which Spenser, like others of his time, held to be part of the province of a great poet. His model inevitably would be Lucretius, as we know from contemporary Elizabethan criticism, but he would also, follow- ing his ideas of originality and imitation, bring in material from other sources, in this case chiefly, I believe, Ovid and Alanus de Insulis. For all these influences and models we have good evidence; we know why he would have known them and why he would have been interested in them. The result is a new poem of surpassing imaginative power, a unit complete in itself, in which the ideas expressed by the Titaness</page><page sequence="11">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" are not necessarily Spenser's own ideas or deepest convictions. To argue that they are, is to be betrayed by the fallacy that sees in Shakespeare's lines saying As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport, a reflection of Shakespeare's own religious belief. They may be, of course, but we must see in Gloster's words, as in Mutability's, pri- marily only the dramatic, not the subjective. As for Spenser's con- clusion, that the order of Nature is justified, that too is conventional, not original, and may be satisfying or not according to our ideas of how the story should end. My point, therefore, is that the presence of Lucretian, Ovidian, and other elements in Mutabilitie has nothing whatever to do, necessarily, with inconsistency, repudiation of the sentiments of the Calender, the Daphnaida, the Hymnes, or with his personal religious faith. The poem is what Mr. Grierson has defined as metaphysical, a poem dealing with cosmical questions, but Spen- ser's treatment is essentially dramatic; the poem is a unit in an imitation of a kind of poetry well recognized in his time, imitating Lucretius precisely as in other parts of FQ he imitated Vergil. With this we could stop, were it not for those troublesome two stanzas. What do they mean, this meditation on the speech of Mutability, on the judgment of Nature, this prayer to Sabaoth God? Let me here refer to a point which I have purposely reserved until this moment. Miss Albright says that Spenser put away his doubt by an act of faith. She thus admits doubt, admits his attempt to resolve these doubts by logical means, and finds the end in a will to believe. That is, having argued against doubt, she finally postulates it. But my point, clearly stated not only in the article which she is reviewing but in the two other essays of the series, is merely that the presence of this material in Spenser indicates his intellectual interest. I have spoken of the sceptical spirit, it is true, but sceptical, of course, means not atheistical, as Miss Albright curiously and unwarrantably inter- prets it, but questioning, the method of Erasmus, the intellectual curi- osity which Spenser possessed as a true son of the Renaissance. But I have also expressed interest in and doubt as to the proper interpre- tation of the two stanzas of reminiscence and prayer. I am not sure what they mean. They may mean, as Miss Albright suggests, the putting off of doubt through definite will to believe. They may have been intended to prelude further metaphysical poetry, the last 694</page><page sequence="12">Edwin Greenlaw two Hymnes, for example. They may have been intended to lead to some part of the fourth book, in which the same problem is treated from the standpoint of worldly affairs. I do not know. My point at present is that here is a critical problem of importance on which difference of opinion may legitimately work, and which will require, if solution is possible, not only further study of evidence but also the most delicate appraisal. Is the poet's position, then, one merely of imitation, imitation of Lucretius or another, a joyous exercise of his creative imagination? Is it, to take another possible view, similar to that of the hymn: Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou who changest not, abide with me. Or is it prelude to a new phase of the entire question, cosmological like the third and fourth hymns, or social like the fourth FQ? Or, finally, is it the real cry of the soul confronted by the mystery of life, unable to find relief in conventional reiteration of a law of order in the universe, responsive to intellectual currents that we know were gaining increased strength when the poem was written. I do not know. This is the ultimate problem of mutability, in Spenser, and in human life. The glory of the poem is that it presents, in cloudy symbol and with unexampled power, a matter of fundamental im- portance. Let us not in our squabble over the first beginnings, the atoms, the elements which are the sources of the poem, lose sight of the end to which all such study, if it is of any moment, must follow, the richer understanding of the poet's genius. III It is pleasant to turn from these matters to more constructive work. In the second of Miss Albright's papers'0 already referred to, she puts forward some novel suggestions in regard to Spenser's Cantos of Mutabilitie. She holds, in brief, that the cantos are early work, that they form that portion of FQ to which Harvey registered ob- jections, and that because of these objections Spenser did not publish them, though he re-worked portions for use in Book V and elsewhere in his work. As a basis for this very interesting hypothesis, she cites not only the letter in which Harvey expressed distaste for FQ in April 1580, but brings into connection with it portions of another letter, this one taken from the Letter Book and not certainly sent to O1 "Spenser's Reasons for Rejecting the Cantos of Mutabilitie," SP XXV, 93. 695</page><page sequence="13">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" Spenser, of uncertain date, but apparently belonging to about the same period. Harvey's adverse report has, of course, long been used in biographies of the poet. It is important for us to recall that in it he speaks of the poem as the "Faerie Queene," as "That Eluish Queene," and that he thinks that Spenser has not succeeded in his purpose to overgo the Orlando Furioso. That is, Harvey was evidently talking of a poem about Elizabeth as a fairy queen, pretty certainly com- mendatory of her, and the poem was a metrical romance. The other letter is longer. It has been singularly neglected, and Miss Albright has done a service in bringing it out into the main stream of Spenser criticism. Three years ago, I read a paper before the Johns Hopkins Philological Association, in which I pointed out the emergence in this letter of three themes that are major through- out Spenser's poetry, including the mutability motif, and suggested the extraordinary interest of the fact that the two friends discussed these themes, that the major interests of all Spenser's work were held in solution in this single document. But I did not publish the paper because of my doubt as to the proper interpretation to be placed on Harvey's words, uncertainty as to the date of the letter, and a convic- tion that the whole subject of the Harvey correspondence is still too uncertain to permit exact reasoning based upon it. For example, this letter, like the famous Harvey-Spenser letters themselves, may have been merely a literary exercise designed chiefly to win publicity. More important, it is impossible, I think, to be certain that Harvey is not really in agreement with Spenser and is merely ironical here. It did not occur to me, of course, to look upon Mutabilitie as the rejected portion of FQ, the rejection being due to Harvey's influence. I am willing, for the present, to drop these doubts about the interpreta- tion of Harvey's words and to examine Miss Albright's thesis on the assumption that the letter is to be taken at its face value. A clear analysis of Miss Albright's argument is difficult for two reasons. In the first place, her article is unnecessarily long by the inclusion of irrelevant and extraneous matter. An example is the long discussion of the curious poem entitled "A Schollars Love," which has nothing to do with the matter that we are now considering. In the second place, Miss Albright repeatedly suggests something as a possibility, and then proceeds to assume that she has proved it and makes use of it in the main portion of her argument. I will give two examples, both of them vital. On page 102, and throughout the later 696</page><page sequence="14">Edwin Greenlawz portion of her essay, she assumes as proved that Harvey read the cantos of Mutabilitie to the friends spoken of in his letter. Her words are, "Harvey's judgment of Mutability was very different from that of most modem critics." If we look back over the earlier pages to see just how we know that what we have in the letter is Harvey's judgment of a particular poem, we find, on page 97, the words, "We may then infer that the letter shows that the Cantos of Mutability were read by Harvey to his circle." We rub our eyes at this calm assumption, and look still farther back, in order to find some grounds, only to discover nothing but the fact that among many other things in the letter is a passage in which Harvey criticizes the poet, or seems to criticize him, for holding views about mutability. That is, there is no indication whatever in the letter that Harvey was speaking of ideas that Spenser had put into verse; the letter is not criticism of poetry but of ideas; and, moreover, these ideas are not so peculiar that their occurrence in the poem Mutabilitie arrests our attention; they are commonplaces of the time. Let us look a bit more closely at this letter. The natural inter- pretation of it would seem to be that Spenser, either in conversation or in another letter, had expressed envy of the quiet life of Cam- bridge scholars, and that Harvey at the instance of his circle had been deputed to rebuke him for entertaining any such exalted views of academic seclusion. The scholar, he says, is wretched; there is not "the like wofull and miserable creature to be founde within the cumpas of the whole worlde .... meere bookeworms and verye idolles, the most intolerable creatures to cum in any good sociable cumpanye that God ever creatid." This done, he launches into his "attack" on Spenser for holding bookish views; criticizes these views, among them the idea of mutability. Not a single word in the letter indicates that Harvey was criticizing a poem, and, as I shall show presently, the mutability matter is by no means the only one of Spenser's ideas which is passed under review. Certainly we cannot assume, without proof, that a specific poem was the subject of discussion. A still more surprising example of that elementary error in investi- gation which we are perpetually warning our students to guard against, namely the error of suggesting a thing as a possibility, then assuming it as true, and finally proceeding to build an argument upon it as a thing proved, appears in Miss Albright's handling of the fancied first book of Irish affairs. We come upon the assumption, fully fledged, on page 115, in the following words: "His [Harvey's] criticism was no 697</page><page sequence="15">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" doubt directly responsible for Spenser's rejecting a plan for one proposed book on Irish affairs at a date when he knew comparatively little about them," etc., which is followed by the assertion, in the same paragraph, that "certain portions of the old book are preserved in Book V," while through the remainder of the essay this is assumed as proved and made the basis of further conclusions. If, as before, we look back through the earlier pages to find on what grounds we are to believe that Spenser projected, 1579-80, a book on Irish affairs, we find, on page 109, the words: "If the IConstancy legend was in- tended in part as a criticism of Elizabeth, it probably had to do with her shifting Irish policies," a sentence which is a masterpiece of in- sinuation without a shred of supporting fact, but which is later, as we have seen, assumed as proved. This is not all, for a moment later, on the same page, we come upon a quotation from Harvey, from the Marginalia, dated 1579 but without any apparent reference to Spen- ser, a warning to all and sundry that treason cannot be wrought with impunity, and that frowardness towards any is a vile state of mind but is peculiarly pernicious and senseless when directed against a prince. Let me insist that nothing in this note indicates any reference to Spenser, least of all to a hypothetical book on Irish affairs. Yet Miss Albright proceeds, "It is possible that besides feeling that the Mutability cantos were poor philosophy Harvey feared that the pro- jected book on Ireland would be too open in criticism of fluctuating policies of state." This is surely an amazing assumption; we may be certain that Harvey did not have Spenser in mind in his note, and also that "the projected book on Irish affairs" has no other basis than Miss Albright's too vivid imagination. If we trace the assumption to its inception, we find, on page 95 of her article, a reference to the Irish setting of both cantos, a fact that requires a very different in- terpretation from that which Miss Albright seeks to fasten upon it. We have then a series of assumptions and suggestions, without proof of any sort save the fact of Irish setting, the suggestion of the editor of the 1609 folio that Mutabilitie appears to be part of a projected book on Constancy, and a casual correspondence in idea be- tween a portion of the Harvey letter and the general topic of mutability in human affairs, that are little by little insinuated as matters proved. When they are examined, they disappear like the giant in Spenser's Legend of Justice. But let us now approach the problem from a different angle, and purely on its merits. Let us assume that Miss Albright merely raises 698</page><page sequence="16">Edwin Greenlawz the interesting question that since it is known that Harvey saw a first draft of a portion of FQ, censured it, and returned it, and since it is known that he expressed disapproval of certain of Spenser's ideas about mutability in this world, a subject which is certainly treated in the cantos of 1609, and since it is also a fact that Mutabilitie was not published until ten years after the poet's death, is it not possible that the poet rejected them because of Harvey's censure. So stated, the suggestion, like any honest suggestion about one of the most vexed problems in Spenser criticism, is attractive and deserves con- sideration. For the statements made above are facts, and admit of no argument; the only question is whether the conclusion that Miss Albright proposes has sound basis. I can find nothing that substantiates Miss Albright's contention. In the first place, there is no connection whatever between Harvey's letter about returning FQ and the letter which Miss Albright takes as a detailed criticism of the first draft of the poem. That is, we have no right to assume that because Harvey returned the MS with the statement that he did not like it, he gave his detailed reasons for not liking it in this other letter, for which we have no date, and which, in its contents, certainly bears no indication that he was discussing Spen- ser's poetry. In the second place, while his letter about FQ has no detailed criticism, we know from it the name of the poem, and that this aspect of the poem was so clear in the portion of it which Harvey saw that he speaks of Spenser's "Eluish Queene," and that it was in- tended to suggest comparison with Orlando Furioso, a highly romantic poem, utterly different from Mutabilitie. If we turn to the letter of censure, we find in it no mention of literary matters, except that Spenser is accused, seriously or jocosely, of being "bookish." We find no suggestion of Irish affairs, or of loyalty to the sovereign or of anything that even remotely suggests a hypothetical "first book of Ireland." On the contrary, Harvey, an opportunist, is blaming Spenser for being "bookish" and not up to date in his view of the world. Third, I wish to consider for a moment Miss Albright's hypothesis of a first book of Ireland as the first form of FQ, the form which Harvey is supposed to be criticizing in this letter. For this hypothesis we have already noted the total absence of evidence, beyond the fact that the setting of Mutabilitie is Irish. This setting, however, has a very different value, one that flatly denies Miss Albright's thesis. It is that the poem belongs to the post Colin Clout period, that is, after 699</page><page sequence="17">Sppenser's "Mutabilitie" 1591. Miss Albright is put into the unfortunate position of main- taining that Spenser wrote a first book of Ireland not only when, as she admits, he knew little of Irish affairs but also when he did not know Irish geography, and, furthermore, when the very passage on which she relies carries with it the lines which point to a late date for the cantos. But I am willing to accept, for the moment, this con- tention as debatable, in order to adduce graver reasons against the hypothesis. For Miss Albright, it will be remembered, postulates a first book of Ireland, on Constancy, presumably critical of the Queen's Irish policy; argues that Harvey objected; and that Spenser, yielding to his friend's advice, suppressed his poem. But Spenser, according to Miss Albright, put a large amount of matter from this hypothetical first book not only into Book V but into other portions of the poem as published. Thus we are put into the impossible position of holding that Spenser rejected Mutabilitie because of Harvey, but that he used the major portion of the book, containing the subjects which Harvey censured most gravely, in the part of FQ that he published during his lifetime. To this Miss Albright would doubtless reply, and with some reason, that it was the controversial and critical part, the dis- loyal part, that was criticized. To which I reply with the query as to what evidence have we of this excised or disloyal part. The answer is that there is none; an answer which cannot be evaded or escaped, and it is final so far as this part of the hypothesis is concerned. Now let us look a little more narrowly into this letter. The passage on which Miss Albright rests her thesis is undubitably a sort of gloss on the idea of mutability. Harvey speaks of a variable course and revolution of all things; the succession of the seasons; the changeable- ness of nature; the changes in moon and tides. So it is with forms and ceremonies, trades, sciences-all flourish for a time and give way. We get tired of the familiar, and men change even in matters of doctrine and religion. That is, Harvey notes mutability, and ap- proves. His objection to Spenser's cantos, then, would be not the content of the cantos, but the conclusion. To put it in another way, his position is that change is a law of life, to be accepted; Spenser, he says, blends the idea of a decadence from a golden age with the theological idea of the effect of sin and the expulsion of Adam from Paradise. It was this interweaving of the two related ideas that was to prove the text of so many discourses in verse and prose of the following century; it is repeated by Milton in Paradise Lost. The 700</page><page sequence="18">Edwin Greenlaw ideas in Spenser are not confined to Mutabilitie alone; they recur again and again in his poetry. Let us look back at Harvey's letter. The passage which I have summarized immediately follows Harvey's com- plaint that Spenser's idealized golden age might have been reasonable a thousand years ago. That is, the point at issue is less that of mutability in human affairs than the unreasonableness of a theory of a golden age. But this theory of a golden age is the fundamental principle of FQ. The return of the Tudors is his theme, the oppor- tunity for the return of the golden age of Arthurian chivalry. I have no time to pursue this matter farther; the one point necessary to the present discussion is to see that far from profiting by or adopting Harvey's criticism, Spenser's whole major poetry is based upon a negation of it. Nor is this all. Besides the golden age motif and the mutability motif in the Harvey letter, there is a third, equally important. It is that while Spenser is inclined to base his ethic on 'the idea of a return of the virtues of the good old times, Harvey says that times have changed. Reason, he tells us, is Spenser's ideal; but the ideal of the present, contrariwise, is appetite. You are over credulous to believe, he says, whatsoever is unadvisedly committed to writings; your greatest error is to suppose that reason should be mistress, plausi- ble enough a thousand years ago, but look about you and you will see that Aristotle is out of fashion, modern wits have all the vogue, men like Machiavel and Aretine. Now this whole passage is a gloss on the position taken by Spenser in the Book of Guyon. Far from accepting Harvey's point of view, the necessity of conformity with the time, Spenser grounds his ethic on the ancients. Harvey's letter, therefore, brings into brief compass three themes in Spenser's work that are seen to be related. We thus realize that what appear to be merely conven- tional references to a golden age in his poetry are not conventional at all but a part of his philosophy of life. Again, the idea of the degenera- tion of nature, clearly set forth by Spenser in a number of places, and coupled by him with the doctrine of the old age of the world, is itself important in the history of ideas and was destined to be brought, in the following century, into sharp conflict with the idea of progress. And finally, the bases of Spenser's thought are to be found in antiquity, not in adaptation to the new world except as the new world might be found to possess images of the old antiquity. What all this means is clear. In the first place, the letter to which Miss Albright directs our attention contains matter not only of 701</page><page sequence="19">Spenser's "Mutabilitie" mutability but also the golden age theme and the reason vs. appetite theme, the three themes that run through the entire body of Spenser's major poetry. If, then, we assume Mutabilitie as already written in 1579-80, we have the same reason for assuming that all the rest of FQ had also been written by that time. Miss Albright's thesis is thus reduced to absurdity. The truth of the matter is, that while Harvey's letter is valueless as a source, since Spenser certainly did not get his ideas from his friend, or trim his course to the advice con- tained in the letter, it is of high value in that it contains in solution an analysis of the major ideas of Spenser's poetry, thus indicating, first, that the two men discussed these ideas together, and, second, that Spenser's thought was not an evolution, but was fairly consistent. This in itself militates against Miss Albright's thesis that Mutabilitie is early work. But not less convincing is the fact that emerges, that Mutabilitie is precisely the one part of FQ that Harvey would have unreservedly endorsed, always assuming, of course, that Spenser was honestly troubled by the argument of the Titaness and that his ac- ceptance of the universe was, as Miss Albright contends in her article on Spenser's religious faith, the result of his will to believe. Harvey would have endorsed the story of Mutabilitie, the body of the poem; he would have jeered at the act of faith. Thus the wheel comes full circle, a proposition which I will not elaborate here. At any rate, we cannot postulate in Mutabilitie an early view of life, abandoned as Spenser grew to maturity. The theme was not peculiar to Spenser, or to Elizabethan literature of the 1580 period. It acquired depth and momentum as the Renaissance passed into the modem world of the seventeenth century. There are other grave reasons why Miss Albright's thesis cannot be accepted, for example, the matter of internal evidence. Professor Belden's article calls attention to the passage in Mutabilitie that definitely places it after Colin Clout. Thus we find in Mutabilitie one of the comparatively few passages in Spenser which can be defi- nitely dated by internal evidence. To Professor Belden's objections, which he sums up by saying that he cannot accept Miss Albright's theories that the poem was composed before Spenser went to Ireland, nor, by consequence, that Harvey's letter is an attack upon it, Miss Albright has made a lengthy but unsatisfactory reply. She confesses that she had not given sufficient attention to the vexed passage, but excuses this inattention on the ground that she is bored by long de- scriptions of underground love affairs, or even respectable public 702</page><page sequence="20">Edwin Greenlaw weddings of English or Irish rivers. This may be true of Miss Al- bright, but Elizabethans were not bored, and we must take them as they were. Aroused by Professor Belden, she studies the subject, and arrives at the conclusion that the passage in question must be an in- terpolation. For this extraordinary idea no satisfactory evidence is given. We are asked, in effect, to believe that the passage is an inter- polation because Miss Albright does not like the subject and because it destroys her thesis. As for what she says of the matter as an interpolation interrupting the main story, the most elementary knowl- edge of Spenser's narrative technique affords illustrations of his habit of varying the monotony of his high heroic flights by interpolations, often pastoral, always in quieter tone. It seems to me, therefore, that Mr. Belden's original contention remains unshaken, and that this fact alone, irrespective of the other considerations which I have brought into the story, must render the judgment against Miss Albright final. If further evidence is needed, however, it is at hand. As Mr. J. C. Smith has pointed out in his edition, the first three books of FQ contain practically no feminine rimes. With Book IV we immedi- ately come upon abundant evidence of this phenomenon. Mutabilitie is marked by it, and is therefore late work.
