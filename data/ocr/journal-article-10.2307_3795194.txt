<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edouard Manet as an Illustrator In his essay on nineteenth-century art, called The Earthly Paradise, Werner Hofmann reminds us that art in this century was preoccupied with defining itself and its aims, that "indeed, the artistic consciousness became its own subject in works of art."1 Each art form excluded from its sphere of attention allusions to, or use of, the techniques and imagery of other arts in order to con- centrate most completely on its own unique qualities of expression. The poet Stephane Mallarme recognized that this aim of exclusiveness was an important element in the painting of his time. In 1876, in an article devoted to Manet, he stated very accurately, in the form of a simulated manifesto, the aims of Impres- sionist painting: "That which I [the Impressionist painter] preserve through the power of Impres- sionism is not the material portion which already exists, superior to any mere representation of it, but the delight of having recreated nature touch by touch. I leave the massive and tangible solidity to its fitter exponent sculpture ... and I take from reality only that which properly belongs to my art."2 Because of this exclusive attitude of each art form, there tended to be little collaboration between practitioners of different artistic media, a phenomenon which was especially true with respect to painting and poetry. Painters were thoroughly determined to escape from the tyranny of the ut pictura poesis theory which had dominated European sculpture and painting since the Renaissance. Many painters had the utmost scorn for the world of literary allusion and symbols, preferring to concentrate on the invention of new means of translating visual impressions onto their canvases. As Mallarme put it, again in the Impressionist manifesto cited above: "I content myself with reflecting on the clear and durable mirror of painting that which perpetually lives yet dies every moment, which only exists by the will of Idea, yet constitutes in my domain the only authentic and certain merit of nature-The Aspect."3 The Impressionist painter (here the word is used to include all of the painters whom Mallarme included in his manifesto; in addition to Manet, there were Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, Morisot, Renoir) not only experimented with various means of transferring the evanescent onto his canvas, but also deliberately chose to depict those commonplace facts of the visual world which had no literary associations. In this sense, not only the tech- nique but also the subject matter of avant-garde painting tried to disavow reliance on any analogies derived from or relating to the world of literature. In spite of this fact, however, some contacts between writers and painters persisted in the third quarter of the century, the years which concern us here. In fact, not only were there contacts, but also there were notable instances of collaboration, some of which form the basis of this study. It is quite surprising that we should find among the works of the outspokenly painting-directed and dominated master of early Impressionism, Edouard Manet, with his reputed scorn for the literary in painting, several notable examples of collaboration with the literary world in the form of illustrations for poetry. Not only do we find these 223</page><page sequence="2">1. Manet, Exotic Flower, (State I) The Maryland Institute (Lucas Collection), Baltimore by courtesy of the Baltimore Museum of Art 2.

Prints Division, The New York Public Library - - Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations illustrations, but we also find that, in handling them, Manet arrived, by means of a subtle transformation of his naturalistic aesthetic, at a form of expression which transcended "that pedestrian banality, that accepted rendering of every- day reality, toward which Impressionism presumably pointed," and instead "arrived," as Robert Goldwater has suggested Monetdid later, "at the Mallarm6an (Symbolist) principle of suggestion by infinite nuance alone."4 The term "illustration" will be used here to describe the works by Manet which are the subject of this study, although in a sense the word is misleading. Manet's prints are not really illustrations in the conventional sense of the word. Rather they are primarily accompaniments or embellishments of words. Now Manet was not by any means the only artist of his time to view the function of illustration as properly being that of an accompaniment or embellishment; in fact, among those of his artistic contemporaries whose artistic reputations have withstood the test of time, this attitude toward illustration was the rule rather than the exception.5 Just as the medieval monk indulged in pure aesthetic enjoyment when he elaborated the letters of a manuscript with fantastic beast, foliage and interlaces, so the illustrators of the eighteen-sixties, the decade when Manet began as an illustrator, very often felt perfectly free to indulge their own whims in the execution of illustrations. In fact, apparently many books which contained mere words alone were saved from complete extinction, or at least lack of sale, by the addition of elegant pictorial adornment.6 We must not make the mistake of thinking that Manet's illustrations are all of a piece, however, for his approach to the artistic problem changed. As we shall see, it became increasingly individual and inventive. The first works that he made in connection with literary commissions followed the common practise of the day of letting the imagination improvise on a general theme, but not bothering to be governed by the specific words, while his illustrations of the seventies display 224</page><page sequence="4">=~-"-~ - - ~-b '-- )L 7 ;-_- A ...4. Manet, The Cat and the Flowers (State I) Philadelphia Museum of Art a greater consciousness of the text and spirit of the literature which they accompany. Before we embark on the examination of the prints themselves, a few more general remarks are in order. We must keep in mind that Manet's graphic works in general, and his illustrations in particular, do not occupy a central position within his artistic output. But this fact does not prevent their providing a special insight into the character of his art as a whole, for in his graphic works he often experimented, less significantly perhaps, but with great simplicity and directness, with effects that are not so immediately apparent in his oils. Because Manet made no essential distinction between works in black and white and those in color, it was possible for him to attack similar artistic problems in several media.7 Hence, some conclusions about his art can be drawn from the study of his illustrations which may shed light upon the content of his oils. Manet's first works in a graphic medium were etchings, and this is true of his illustrations, too, even though the latter were not executed until he had been involved in print-making for about seven or eight years.8 Etching was undergoing a revival when Manet first began his print-making career, having been in a short period of eclipse in the forties and fifties. This revival, promoted by litterateurs, aimed to ensure that etching be spared the fate which had befallen lithography and wood-engraving, which had become very mechanized because of their application to illustrated material for popular magazines and newspapers. Critics like Baudelaire and Gautier promoted the idea that the true role of etching was to express the personality of the draughtsman, to convey his handwriting to the spectator.9 Also, editions of etchings were very carefully handled when they were issued; they were issued only in limited numbers and were lavish in format. Undoubtedly, the emphasis upon the unique spontaneity of etching, as well as on its esoteric quality, had a great effect upon Manet's print-making endeavors 225</page><page sequence="5">5. Manet, Illustrations for Le Fleuve by Charles Cros Library of Congress, Rosenwald Collection 5a. High Mountains 5b. Mountain Meadow 5c. The River in the Plain 5d. The Sea 226</page><page sequence="6">as well as upon the taste of those consumers on whose taste he depended for commissions. The attitude also helps to explain in part why Manet's illustrations were all done to accompany poetry. Manet's first illustration was an etching, made to accompany a sonnet by Armand Renaud entitled Exotic Flower (illus. 1), which appeared in Philippe Burty's deluxe publication, Sonnets and Etchings, published in 1868.10 The print is related to the sonnet only in title. Its appeal is self-sufficient, being conveyed in its picturesque, romantic imagery. Like many of the artist's paintings of the earlier part of the sixties, the imagery depends in part on the spectator's awareness of its quotation of a visual source; this time Goya, plate 15 of the Caprichos, entitled "Bellos consejos" (illus. 2) seems the most similar in its handling of the etching and aquatint combination and the design of the figure. At the same time, Manet's lady is more aloof than Goya's and implies none of the moral commentary that is so essential to the meaning of the Spanish print. Manet has flattened the woman's figure by covering separate areas with uniform tone and has silhouetted her against the aquatinted background so as to reinforce the effect of the two- dimensional pattern rather than to focus attention on a narrative connotation. In a very real sense, Manet has contrived an image which is a statement of this unique artistic vision rather than an interpretation of words on a page. The second of Manet's illustrations, another work of the late sixties, exhibits a similar preoccupation with conveying his artistic message rather than with the specific content of the literature which the illustration accompanies. The print, a lithograph, entitled the Meeting of the Cats (illus. 3), was used to embellish an article on cats appearing in La Chronique Illustree of October 25, 1868, and also as a poster announcing the forthcoming publication of a book about cats, their habits and history, by Champfleury.'1 Again, as in the case of the Exotic Flower, stylization through reduction of the cats' shapes to rather bizarre, two-dimensional silhouettes, combined with a conventionally drawn perspective delineation of the setting, is more important to the artist than the text which the depiction accom- panied. The most satisfactory explanation of the expressive function of this contrast in handling seems to be that Manet viewed the print as a means of pro- moting his own artistic experimentations rather than as an enhancement of a text. The third and final print of the sixties which Manet executed as an accompani- ment to literature is the etching and aquatint, The Cat and the Flowers (illus. 4), which appeared in the second, deluxe edition of Champfleury's book on cats mentioned above.'2 In this etching, Manet integrates the decorative, two-dimen- sional and the spatial, three-dimensional elements seen in the other two illustra- tions while at the same time he retains their quality of self-sufficiency and static elegance. An exotic flavor, this time inspired by a Japanese color wood-block print, and the continued use of flattened areas and linear surface embellishments attest to the artist's continued fascination with stylization to create a striking design. Once more, we see that there is no specific relation to words in the book, but that there is a perfect consistency with the most "conservative" ele- ments of Manet's painting style during the sixties. Undoubtedly a major reason 227</page><page sequence="7">6. Manet, Illustrations for Le Corbeau, Mallarm6's translation of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe Philadelphia Museum of Art ex libris 6a. The Flying Raven (ex libris) for the persistence, this late in his work, of the romantic picturesque element which he had by this time erased from his oils was that the litterateurs with whom Manet was collaborating continued to admire his etchings of this type.13 Manet's illustrations of the seventies are quite different from those of the sixties. Instead of relying on linear, retrospectively derived and decorative elegance for the main effect of his images, Manet selected objects and personages from his immediate experience and rendered them in the most abbreviated manner possible. This new graphic style is first seen in a series of eight small etchings illustrating, or accompanying a poem by Charles Cros entitled Le Fleuve.'4 The etchings seem to have been executed during the second half of the year 1873, although they were not published until the following spring. The poem describes stages in the life of a large river, beginning with its origins in the glaciers of the high mountains, running through upland meadows, fertile plains, populous cities, until it ends its life in the sea. Six little etchings depict scenes directly associated with the poetic description of the major stages in the river's career. To typify each stage, Manet created a small landscape view, which, despite its small size and consequent lack of detail, immediately calls to mind the terrain described in the text. Each of these views differs quite markedly from the other, indicating the extent to which Manet had already abandoned the mannerisms and elegant stylizations of his earlier work in favor of an apparent ingenuousness which defied simple stylistic labelling. In the scene of High Mountains (illus. 5a), the peaks and glacier stand out in strong relief against an almost black,densely hatched sky, while the snow-covered areas in light contain no modelling what- soever. The scene of the Mountain Meadow (illus. 5b), by contrast, shows an almost completely unshadowed scene, with trees and land indicated in very brief outlines. The third illustration, The River in the Plain (illus. 5c), presents 228</page><page sequence="8">6b. "Once upon a midnight dreary..." a scene of calm serentiy and breadth, with no sharp light or strong contrasts indicated. In contrast to the three rural scenes, which are unspecific as to loca- tion, the two urban views are clearly scenes of Paris, showing glimpses of life on the banks of the Seine. Finally, the last scene of the series, in many ways the finest depicts the sea as the culmination of the river's life in a lively and captivating image (illus. 5d). Each boat and wave is indicated with utter simplicity, but with complete recognizability. The composition is similar to that of other marines by Manet, but no other version is as summarily handled as this one. In addition to the six little landscape vignettes of Le Fleuve, Manet made two little etchings to serve as hors textes, or adornments. Unlike the landscapes, these are merely single images which serve to characterize the theme of the poem without specific reference to its words. One shows a dragonfly, drawn with a few fine lines and areas of drypoint. The other shows two swallows winging together through the sky. Both of these little adornments illustrate Manet's power of selectivity and his command of his newly devised graphic style as compared with the meticulously detailed rendering of his earlier etchings. The change of style seen in Manet's illustrations for Le Fleuve is further developed in this next series of illustrations, those for Mallarm6's translation of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe.15 Unlike the illustrations for Cros' poem, the large illustra- tions for Le Corbeau were printed on sheets separated from the text and were lithographs executed on transfer paper with a brush and ink, a technique which allowed the artist not only to work easily on a large scale, but also to render areas and shapes with a maximum spontaneity. The medium also facilitated the suppression of detail and the limitation of value gradations to the two extremes of black and white. 229</page><page sequence="9">6c. The raven entering the room W Although there are differences in handling evident between the illustrations for Le Fleuve and those of Le Corbeau, they must not blind us to the fact that the latter represent a development of the style first used in the former rather than a negation of it. In the first place, the images are all directly related to the words of the poem. Secondly, they are all contemporary in source, containing no refer- ences to the styles of older artists. Finally, the meaning is conveyed through the handling of the forms themselves rather than through extra-artistic means. Although the images are completely individual, their full meaning is not apparent until they are viewed in the context of the words which they accompany. At the same time, when the poem is read in conjunction with the illustrations, one has no difficulty in understanding what is being depicted. There are four narrative pictures and two ornamentations outside of the text. One of these latter, showing the bust of the bird in profile (cover illus.), appeared on the posters announcing the forthcoming publications of Mallarme's transla- tion, as well as on its title page. In this image, we see how far Manet has moved from his prints of the sixties. Gone is the chic stylization, the sophisticated quotation of other works of art. Instead, the raven is characterized for us by his head alone. Manet has endowed the bird with an almost human expression, a short-of-malevolent sneer, which emphasizes the dominant feeling that the poem presents about the creature's destructive presence. For the ex libris page (illus. 6a), Manet selected a different image of the bird, perhaps to complement the anthropomorphic conception given on the frontis- piece. Here he stresses the predatory nature of the raven as it soars in the air with outstretched wings. This image, although not directly inspired by a textual 230</page><page sequence="10">6d. The raven "perched upon the bust of Pallas" - ^. r . delineation, is an extremely forceful characterization of the evil genius which broods throughout the poem. If we turn now to the scenes which are direct illustrations of the incidents of the poem, we are struck by the fact that they illustrate only those aspects of the text which could successfully be rendered in concrete visual terms. One would like to know at this point how much Manet discussed the matter of illustrations with Mallarm6 before embarking on his task. It is quite likely that Manet knew the poem reasonably well. He had been an ardent admirer and good friend of Baudelaire before he ever met Mallarm6, and shared with the younger poet an admiration of Baudelaire's translations of the poems of the American author.16 In 1887, four years after Manet's death, Mallarm6 dedicated an edition of his own translations of Poe's poems to the artist with the words: "To Edouard Manet, these poems which we so often read together." With his interest in Poe as shared with Baudelaire and Mallarm6, then, it is possible Manet might have known about Poe's belief in the fantastic as residing in the ordinary objects of commonplace existence,17 and that this knowledge might have affected his choice of imagery to some extent. In the first scene (illus. 6b), we see the man (who, incidentally, resembles Manet's portrait of Mallarme&amp;8 rather closely) seated at his desk at night (a reference to the poem's opening words, "Once upon a midnight dreary"), poring over books- called by Poe "many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore." (One wonders if Manet had ever seen Mallarm6 pondering over some piece of cabalistic literature late at night.)19 The man has turned his head; obviously he has heard the tapping, "as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door." Manet evokes a mood of tension and foreboding here as it is conveyed in the 231 I .</page><page sequence="11">6e. "Nevermore" first three stanzas by isolating the figure under the lamplight and by covering the surrounding areas with solid black wash that trails off irregularly at the edges in agitated brush strokes. As in the poem, light is associated with reality, the facts of solid and tangible existence, while darkness is linked with the illusory, the mysterious realm of fantasy that overcomes the man later in the poem. The second scene in the series presents a different sort of image, for it depicts the poem's only dramatic occurrence, the moment when the raven enters the man's room (illus. 6c). Manet has taken advantage of a liberty which Mallarme took in the translation in order to dramatize the event. He shows the raven enter- ing the room in flight, while in the English version of the poem, the raven "stepped" into the room. Mallarme translated the passage using the word entra, so Manet was perfectly at liberty to interpret the action as flying. It may even be that Manet understood the poem only in French, in which case he might not even have been aware that he had taken any liberties with the English text, although Mallarm6 could easily have pointed out his error to him. In any case, the flying movement of the raven is not the only means by which Manet has enlivened the scene, for the disposition of tonal contrasts also heightens the feeling of excitement. The large area of dark wash into which the man's body merges beneath the open window is dramatically relieved by the stark white silhouette of the man's hand with its fingers spread wide to convey agitation. Motion is transmitted in the fluttering curtains beside the window and the active strokes which cover the area at the left. The third illustration (illus. 6d), contrasting in composition and mood with the first two as befits its different theme, has a deliberately subdued and unspecific character. Here the image refers to the entire remainder of the poem rather than 232</page><page sequence="12">to any one stanza. The man is now seated confronting the image of the bird, who perches on the bust of Pallas over the door. No emotional intensity is sug- gested here, rather there is a sense of interminable waiting. Again, Manet emphasizes the association of light with the human figure, the world of reality, while the dark, the absence of light, is associated with the bird, representative of the supernatural realm. The last picture is the most concise image of the group (illus. 6e). Its text is found in the poem's last stanza: "And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; / And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor / Shall be lifted-nevermore!" In giving visible form to these words, Manet substituted for the representations of the man and the bird an empty chair and a cast shadow. The chair faces the door, as it does in the preceding picture, but it has changed its character, for now it is small and cane-seated, probably chosen because it is more easily depicted as empty than the armchair. The empty chair, facing the shadow, suggests that the man has been swallowed up by the brooding bird whose shadow floats in the lower center of the illustration. Again, the white areas of lamplight form a stark contrast to the dark shadows of the bird and chair. The composition conveys instability which communicates the emptiness and grief, as well as the unsatisfied desires of the end of the poem. Manet must have felt that these illustrations were an artistic success, even though not a financial one, for in the years following, until just before his death, he continued to plan for other editions of Poe's poems in collaboration with his friend.20 Although no further publication of Poe's works was issued by the two men, there was one more joint project which did see the light of day, the illustrated edition of Mallarme's own poem, L'Apres-Midi d'un faune.21 For this project, Manet executed in the new style four drawings to be made into wood-engravings (illus. 7). The assignment must have posed quite a challenge to Manet, since Mallarme's poem deals not with real events, but with surrounding illusions about events, but he handled the problem in a very suitable manner by inventing two very much abbreviated images of the dramatis personae of the poem-the faun and the nymphs-and two little ornamentations, a bunch of grapes and a flower and grasses. Although in this case Manet was not called upon to do anything in the way of narrative invention, he did in his very simple succinct manner of rendering the little images succeed in finding a visual means of complementing the poem's reticent hermeticism.22 This survey of the character and scope of Manet's illustrations has been pre- sented with the hope of elucidating Manet's individual escape from the dead end of the "pedestrian banality of Impressionism." By using images which are spontaneous and essentially ingenuous in effect, he invented a new technique of expression which suggested a creative way out of his century's dilemma, the preoccupation with art for art's sake. By depicting images that, on first acquaint- ance, captivate with their freshness and simplicity, and are also endlessly rewarding on greater familiarity, he did invent a new kind of 'imaginization," or image-centered language, on which the art of the future could and did build. 233</page><page sequence="13">Notes: Manet and Mallarme :*~:^ BiSlIjSII? -^' *;.* *2B1ased on English translation in Hamilton, _r#~ ~and 4Philip Gilbert Hamerton:th Painting Thin France .' .

In fact, it is very likely that one of the first, if not the very first print which he made was a portrait of Edgar Allan Poe, which may have been intended to accompany Baudelaire's essay on the American author.
