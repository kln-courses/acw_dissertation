The authors place a good deal of emphasis on the use of "hidden pictures" in the drawings (e.g., nos. 8, 9, 22, 84, 152, I58), which at one point they even refer to as "very characteristic for Courbet" (p. 260). But, so far the only example of this practice in Courbet's art is the Fantastic Land- scape with Anthropomorphic Rocks (private collection), which was first seen at the Courbet exhibition in the Louvre in 1977 (cat. no. 81). There is no unanimous agreement as to the attribution of this painting. David Cox, 1783-I859. Exhibition catalogue by Stephen Wildman with introductory essays by Richard Lockett andJohn Murdoch, 1983-84 (Birming- ham Museums and Art Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, London). 136 pp., 73 illus., 5 text figs., i8 colorplates. David Cox was born two centuries ago-the son of a metal-worker-at Deritend, a walkable distance from the center of Birmingham. He died in 1859 at Green- field House, Harborne Village, now a residential sub- urb and a short bus journey from the same city. Of both choice and necessity he passed much of his life as a mature artist away from Birmingham, teach- ing in Hereford for a number of years and working in London for two periods of residence, the longer lasting from 1827 until 1841. Cox remains a revered native of the Midlands city, along with Edward Burne-Jones, honoured by an ex- hibition by the Arts Council of Great Britain in I975- 76. It was both predictable and appropriate, in the normal course of events, that Birmingham should stage a major commemorative Cox exhibition (uly 26-October 14, I983) organized by the City Museums and Art Gallery. Cox, however, transcends parochial hagiography as a figure of national status whose achievements demand assessment in any survey of British nineteenth-century art, and the show contin- ued to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (November 9, I983-January 8, 1984), the home of the national collection of British drawings. The last Cox exhibition of any magnitude was also held in his place of birth in 1959 to mark the centenary of the painter's death, and this, understandably, shared a number of exhibits with its successor. Over the last century the City Art Gallery has amassed the largest and most representative collection of the artist's works in all media, a situation not unrelated to the enthusiasm of local collectors and benefactors who have made im- portant gifts and bequests, including the originals of the images famous from the older literature. The last monographs, part of a spate of British publishing after the Second World War, were by Frederick Gordon Roe, Cox the Master: the Life and Art of David Cox 1783-1859 of 1946, followed the next year by David Cox by Sir Trenchard Cox, the former director of both museums taking this show and, as he often had to explain, unrelated to the artist. Since then very little has been published. The basic nineteenth-century biography ofNeil Solly (1873) has been reprinted, and the general student has had avail- able that useful summary of Cox's life-often de- scribed as uneventful-contained in the second vol- ume of Martin Hardie's Water-Colour Painting in Britain. In the catalogue of the exhibition under review, the details of the artist's career are succinctly summarized in a chronology. Historically, this exhibition belongs in a sequence of shows of the last decade or so, of varying scholarly weight, detail, and status, which have been devoted to British nineteenth-century artists. The watercolorists in particular have come under scrutiny. In the present case the selection and the catalogue have been made by Stephen Wildman, a deputy keeper in the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery with responsibility for its Department of Prints and Drawings. He has concen- trated on works available for his inspection in the United Kingdom, and there can be little to criticize in this. Some fine Cox drawings are owned outside the country, with a certain number in the United States, although his representation is not so strong in Ameri- can collections as that of many of his compatriots. The basis for any selection lies in the Birmingham hold- ings, where many items have been specially restored, but this fine nucleus was critically extended by loans from the London national museums, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Tate Gallery, along with the Courtauld Institute Gal- leries, and collections in Oxford, Cambridge, Preston, Hereford, Bury, Manchester, Liverpool, Dudley, Worcester, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Newcastle, and [ 461 ] REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">R EV I EW S private sources. The assemblage was a thoughtful, dis- criminating, and satisfyingly inclusive one, catalogued in entries which manage to be highly informative yet lively and enthusiastic. In the general light of Cox criticism, the most sub- stantial and challenging of the three introductions to the catalogue is that by John Murdoch "Cox: Doctrine, Style and Meaning." This offers a corrective for any superficial notions which might easily be given by the literature of a benign and industrious, but unideated and instinctive "Papa Cox," relentlessly pursuing a narrow course of production in provincial isolation from the intellectual and aesthetic ferments of his age, endlessly renewed only by the confrontation with the moods and effects of nature in their wilder or more placid aspects. At one level we are reminded of the influences of Fundamentalist morality and especially Tory political conservatism, but more emphatically of Cox's roots in the soils of Payne Knight's influential categorization of his concepts of the Sublime and the Beautiful and Uvedale Price's codification of the Pic- turesque. Cox came to full artistic maturity in the bur- geoning Victorian era and, as Murdoch at the outset seems willing to admit, there may be modifications that could be made to the outlines he draws, some Romantic softening and shading, it might well be felt, to the eighteenth-century credos. He describes, in a vividly phrased industrial extension of the Burkeian Sublime, the juxtaposition of stallion and distant moonlit Birmingham Express in the large, memorable watercolour The Night Train (cat. no. 79) where the steam train exemplifies "vast outpourings of opaque smoke, hellish fiery glimmers of furnace and steel, and sudden frightful noise." Literary and philosophical parallels assist here in envisaging the artist in a wider context of contemporary notions of the relationship of Man and Nature, culminating, in some senses, in the melancholy and poignancy of the late, "wild" Welsh subjects of Bettws-y-Coed. It is comforting to read a categorical rejection of the superficial and inappropri- ate coupling of Cox with French Impressionism (more specifically, it is usually the Pre-Impressionism of Boudin) in this highly stimulating essay. For much of his life Cox, like some of his peers, was obliged to make part of his living by teaching, al- though his pupils were scarcely notable and none rivaled his accomplished son. Perhaps the art of David Cox junior will be illuminated by a future Birming- ham display? Richard Lockett in the first of his two introductions, "Cox the Drawing Master," picks his way most usefully through the complex ambiguities of the published didactic treatises and drawing books bearing Cox's name or attributable to him and which promulgated some of his technical and aesthetic as- sumptions over several decades. The early nineteenth-century historicizing preoccu- pations with a largely imagined image of"olden time" -here predominantly Elizabethan and Jacobean and set against the background of surviving architectural fabric-were highly congenial to Cox's brand of Ro- manticism and conservative social precepts, and he built up a repertoire of favorite historical sites. Lock- ett's second essay, "Dear Old Haddon," with its re- lated section of the catalogue with six drawings, focuses on Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, a property of the Man- ners family, and the object of many affectionate visits. The drawings and paintings are not generally dated individually in the catalogue, but arranged in approxi- mate chronological sections, one being devoted to a selection of free, graceful, and luminous Continental studies made by the somewhat chauvinistic Cox, those of Paris, it is recorded, being often taken from a cab when the artist had sprained his ankle. He was unques- tionably less adventuresome in travels than many of his itinerant contemporaries and, apart from England, it was specifically to the solitude of the Welsh uplands that he turned; even London, for him, became too full of "bustle." Watercolors formed the backbone of this show, but the artist's drawing style was revealed in a variety of media, in the vital, fluent black chalk studies, and to a lesser extent in more intricately worked sepia wash, although there were relatively few of the studies from nature on the bright blue paper which he often used in his earlier career. To compensate, there were many major watercolors on the irregular, rough and absor- bent Dundee wrapping sheets, the "Scotch" or "David Cox" paper which he exploited with such freedom and vivacity of effect while it was available to him. Amongst them were notable works of the I840's and [ 462 ]</page><page sequence="3">I850's which represent an aesthetic climax to Cox's draughtmanship with their meandering, skeletal un- derdrawing in graphite or black chalk, casual yet pre- cise, over which float loose layers of color wash in transparent patches or stabs and dashes of flickering dilute pigment. These watercolors enshrine some of the memorable moments in the spectrum of British drawing. Famous and little-known items were scrupu- lously garnered from a field studded with careful imi- tations and respectful emulations as well as outright commercial forgeries. One of the Birmingham ver- sions of The Porch of St Phillip's Church, Birmingham (no. 36) had always perplexed the present reviewer when briefly in charge of the collection, as it seemed both gauche and labored, particularly when compared to the scintillating "study" for it (no. 35). There may be certain precedents for the dumpiness of the figures, the clumsiness of the architectural detail and awkward- ness of spatial projection, but it comes as no surprise that Scott Wilcox (Burlington Magazine, October 1983) sees this as a copy, noting also that A Risky Position (no. 67), which appeared so obtrusively hard and elaborate in handling, might be attributed to Cox junior. The graphic area was rounded out by prints by and after Cox, published drawing books, a small icono- graphic display, "David Cox the Man," and selected memorabilia which were centered around that some- what dubious recent cliche of a simulated studio, a deception happily omitted from the London showing. In 1839, at the age of 56, Cox had somewhat appre- hensively turned back again to oil painting. There re- mains to this day (as in the past) a critical division of opinion as to the stature of his oil paintings. Wildman has no doubts as to their significance among the "greatest, but least recognized, achievements of any British painter." It has often been pointed out that there are cross influences in style, handling, and tonal- ity between drawings and paintings, but such situations are not unique and this purist approach can be made too much of. Certainly some late, heavily worked drawings with their repeated strokes and superim- posed flecks of darker pigment suggest oil technique, while small oils such as Crossing the Sands or The Cross Roads (nos. 87 and 9I) reveal much of the high-keyed transparency and limpid atmospheric clarity of water- colors, but are they to be rated any lower for that? The exhibition offered opportunities for compari- sons, for example the handling of the Fitzwilliam oil Vale of Clywd (no. 90), which Wildman considers Cox's outstanding work in the medium, could be re- lated to that of watercolors such as the Whitworth Lane at Harbome (no. 8 3) dating from the same year of I 849. The catalogue is attractive, illustrating a good pro- portion of the exhibits in usually clean, only occasion- ally dense, monochrome, along with eighteen color plates which, if they occasionally stray fractionally in hue from the originals, are most evocative and ser- viceable. Comparative figures in the text are under- captioned (lacking size or medium), but this is mild criticism of a well produced reference work which will do admirable duty until a comprehensive modern study appears, and which well records a significant exhibition. Harley Preston The Pre-Raphaelites. Exhibition catalogue edited by Leslie Parris, 1984 (Tate Gallery, London). 3 12 pp., numerous illus. and color pls. At the black-tie private view of the Tate Gallery's splendid Pre-Raphaelite exhibition, crowded with le tout Londres, it was hard to remember that one was celebrating the achievement of an undoubtedly revolu- tionary movement. It is no accident that the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood was formed in I848; yet it is perhaps characteristically English that while continen- tal Europe tore itself apart in a Year of Revolutions, the most lastingly radical and anti-establishment manifes- tation to appear in London was the foundation of a group of artists who felt the enchantment of the past as much as they believed they should address themselves to the moral issues of the present.
