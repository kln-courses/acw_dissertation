THE VEDIC ANTECEDENTS OF IIVA Many of the characteristics which contribute to the apparently paradoxical nature of the Puranic Siva may be traced back to in- dividual characteristics of gods of the Vedic pantheon. Both Siva and Brahma derive their creative attributes from the Vedic figure of the Prajapati, the primeval creator; from Indra, Siva inherits his phallic and adulterous character; from Agni, the heat of asceticism and passion; and from Rudra he takes a very common epithet as well as certain dark qualities. 1. RUDRA, GOD OF DESTRUCTION Although an overemphasis on the identity of Rudra and Siva has led to certain misleading generalizations, there is nevertheless a strong relationship between them. Siva's paradoxical nature in the Puranas is based in part upon the superficially ambiguous nature of Rudra as creator and destroyer, the god with a shining exterior and a dark interior,1 god of the storm and of healing herbs.

In the Rg Veda, Rudra is invoked as a god of death: "Do not slaughter our father or our mother."2 In later metaphysical developments, death becomes less personal, and Siva destroys the universe by fire at the end of each eon, purifying it by sprinkling it with ashes.3 This cosmic role appears in the later mythology as a kind of necrophilia attributed to Siva, who fre- quents funeral grounds smeared with the ashes of corpses,4 and even becomes incarnate in a corpse.5 This significant aspect of Siva, together with the name of Rudra which is given to Siva throughout the Puranas, is derived almost entirely from the Vedic Rudra. 2. INDRA, PHALLIC GOD OF FERTILITY But the other aspect of Siva, the phallic god, the giver of seed, is not merely an arbitrary philosophical reversal of his destructive role. To a certain extent, his sexuality may be derived from his ancient connection with the ascetic cults and their sexual mani- festations, but many of the myths of fertility and much of the phallic religion may be derived from Siva's close connection with Indra, the Vedic king of the gods.6 One tie between Indra and Siva is formed by the group of the Maruts or Rudras, storm gods. In the Rg Veda they are the com- panions of Indra. Later they are called Indra's brothers, and they are the sons of Rudra,7 who, according to one myth, adopted them when Indra tried to kill them in fraternal jealousy.8 The two gods share many characteristics: both are said to have three eyes 9 or a thousand eyes,10 and for the same reason: "Once the apsaras Tilottama was sent to seduce the demons Sunda and Upasunda 2 Rg Veda I. 114.7; cf.

While she danced before them, Siva and Indra wanted to see more of her, and for this purpose Siva became four- faced and Indra thousand-eyed."11 In this, as in the myth of Brahma and his daughter,* the cause and purpose of the extra eyes is a sexual one.12 Both Indra and Siva here play the part of the seduced ascetic; both are fertility gods. Indra in the Mahd- bhdrata is the god of the seed who dissuades King Uparicara from his tapas and teaches him to erect "Indra-poles,"13 phallic em- blems which are the antecedents of the Siva-liiga. With these qualities goes a series of myths that are told about both gods. Like Siva, Indra is known as an adulterer, famed for the seduction of Ahalya, the wife of the sage Gautama,14 a crime for which he is sexually mutilated15 as Siva is.16 One version of the Pine Forest tale refers to the castration of Indra when describing the same fate as it befalls Siva.17 Indra is the traditional enemy of ascetics, as is Siva himself on occasion. The tapas of the ascetic threatens the kingdom of Indra, who is himself weakened by his lack of chastity, and Indra seduces the sage's wife or sends an ap- saras or even his own wife or daughter to weaken the ascetic and turn him from his tapas,t just as Siva uses his own sexual charms, or those of his wife, to dissuade the Pine Forest sages from their tapas.18 Both gods are associated with anti-Brahmanical, hetero- dox acts, and each loses his right to a share of the sacrifice.19 Indra once killed the Brahmin Namuci, and Namuci's head pur- 11 Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa, Mahdbhdrata (hereafter MHB), ed.

The commentator on the epic remarks that Siva may assume the epithet of Indra because there is no difference between them;23 and Indra, trying to dissuade a householder from performing tapas for Siva, says, "Siva is no different from me."24 In this context, in this role, there is no difference; Indra and Siva were not identified with each other because they hap- pened to amass similar characteristics. Rather, from the time of the late Vedas, Rudra and Indra were given similar attributes (e.g., the Maruts) because they served an identical function. 3. AGNI, THE EROTIC FIRE The ascetic Siva of the Puranas frequently uses his tapas as a weapon against his enemies, particularly against Kama. In the .Rg Veda. most of the verses in which tapas is used as heat against enemies are hymns to Agni, the god of fire,25 who blasts with his tapas those who are impious and who perform the ritual with an evil purpose,26 just as Siva burns the impious Pine Forest sages. The fiery power of tapas serves as a natural bridge between the two gods; and it is said, "All the various forms of fire are ascetics [tapasvin-s], all takers of vows, and all are known to be parts of Rudra himself."27 But most of the Saiva myths are derived from Agni personified not as the heat of tapas but as the opposite force, the heat of sexual desire. Many myths are based upon a combination of the 20 MHB IX.42.28-36; cf. MHB V.9-14, XII.273.26-54; Hdldsyamdhdtmya No. 1, p. 7; T. A.

Springing from the natural physiological analogy, the tie between Agni and kdma was supported in Hindu thinking by the identification of ritual heat, tapas, with sexual heat, kdma.28 A hymn of the Atharva Veda invokes Agni to madden a man with love ;29 another text states, "Agni is the cause of sexual union... When a man and woman become heated, the seed flows, and birth takes place."30 As a personified deity, Agni is an unscrupulous seducer of women and an adulterer, qualities which cause him to be identified with Rudra.31 When Siva destroys the triple city of the demons, his weapon is fire, one of his eight forms, and the burning of the demon women is described in erotic terms: When Siva burnt the triple city with his fiery arrow, the women were burnt as they made love with their lovers in close embraces. One woman left her lover but could go nowhere else, and she died in front of him. One lotus- eyed woman, weeping, cried, "Agni, I am another man's wife; you, who witness the virtue of the triple world, should not touch me. Go away, leav- ing this house and my husband who lies with me." ... Some women were burnt as they ran from their husbands' embraces; others, asleep and intoxi- cated, exhausted after love-making, were half-burnt before they awoke and wandered about, stunned.32 Erotic death by fire is frequently associated with the suttee motif; the original "suttee" was Sati, who entered the fire when her hus- band, Siva, was dishonored. When Sati, reborn as Parvati, was about to marry Siva again, the women of Himalaya's city admired the bridegroom, who was the personification of death by fire: "They blamed their lovers and praised Siva, saying, 'What use have we for our lovers, and our nights of love-making ? We will not continue on the wheel of life, but we will enter the fire, and Siva will be our husband.' 33 4. AGNI AND THE PINE FOREST SAGES Siva is more explicitly related to the erotic, destructive fire in the myth of the Pine Forest, which can be traced directly to the story of Agni and the wives of the Seven Sages, a text which is the source of much of the myth of the birth of Kumara as well.34 A late Vedic 28 Atharva Veda III.21.4; Taittiriya Samhitd 2.2.3.1. 29 Atharva Veda VI.130.4. 30 Satapatha Brdhmana 3.4.3.4-5 and 3.5.3.16. 31 F.

Agni desired them and united with them. His seed fell and became the earth, the sky, and the plants that are eaten by fire."35 This statement foreshadows the role of fire and water in the Kumara story (in which the seed of 8iva is placed first in Agni and then in the Ganges); another version of this story concludes: "Agni's seed fell and became gold,"36 and the seed of 8iva, the source of Kumara, is gold.? All later versions describe the seduced women not as the wives of Varuna but as the wives of the Seven Sages: Originally, the Krttikas [the Pleiades] were the wives of the Bears [or Stars, the constellation Ursa Major], for the Seven Sages were in former times called the Bears. They were, however, prevented from intercourse [with their husbands], for the latter, the Seven Sages, rise in the North, and they [the Krttikas] in the East. Now, it is a misfortune for one to be pre- vented from intercourse [with his wife] .... But in fact Agni is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have intercourse.37 No causal relationship seems to be suggested here between the Krttikas' separation from their husbands and their connection with Agni. In many of the later versions, however, it is clearly stated that they were abandoned by their husbands because of their impregnation by Agni (or 8iva),38 and in one version they are cursed to become constellations for this reason.39 Yet in the earliest full version of this story, in the Mahiibhdrata, they are given the reward of becoming constellations and dwelling forever in heaven as compensation for having been abandoned by their husbands: Once when Agni saw the beautiful wives of the great sages sleeping in their hermitage, he was overcome by desire for them. But he reflected, "It is not proper for me to be thus full of lust for the chaste wives of the Brahmins, who are not in love with me." Then he entered the household fire so that he could touch them, as it were, with his flames, but after a long time his desire became still greater, and he went into the forest, resolved to abandon his corporeal form. Then Svaha [the oblation], the daughter of Daksa, fell in love with him and watched him for a long time, seeking some weak point, but in vain. When she knew that he had gone into the forest, full of desire, the amorous goddess decided to take the forms of the wives of the Seven Sages and to seduce Agni; thus both of them would obtain their desire. Assuming the form of each of the wives in turn, she made love with Agni; she took his seed and threw it into a golden lake on the white mountain. 35 Taittiriya Samhitd 5.5.4.1. 36 Taittiriya Brahmana 1.1.3.8. ?

By his grace, they became the constellation of the Krttikas, considered the mothers of Kumara. Then Svaha married Agni.40 The elemental Agni, as well as the anthropomorphic, is very much in evidence here. He comes to the sages' wives in the form of the household fire, and, when spurned, he withdraws his elemental form as Siva does in the Pine Forest, causing darkness to spread throughout the universe.41 Agni's wife, Svaha, is merely the per- sonification of the oblation, the natural partner of the sacrificial fire; and she is the daughter of Daksa, like Sati, who makes her- self an oblation, a suttee. Later versions of the Pine Forest myth simply transfer from Agni to Siva more and more of the attributes which they share, using the basic plot and characters to point new morals, maintaining even-or rather, especially-the ambiguous elements. Thus the (false?) ascetic (Agni-8iva) desires the wives of the great sages (Pine Forest sages or Seven Sages) but conquers his own desire. He enters the forest to find them (or to avoid them), and they (or their impersonators) fall in love with him. The ques- tion of their actual seduction is unresolved, as in the myth of Rsyariiga. Upon this part of the myth the story of the castration of Siva and the origin of liiiga worship was grafted. The second half of the myth-the miraculous birth of Kumara from the golden seed placed in fire and water-was used as a sequel to the sacred wedding of Siva and Parvati; and this part of the Agni myth is based in turn upon a much older tale, the Vedic myth of Praja- pati's incestuous seed. 5. THE GOLDEN SEED OF FIRE In the Vedas, Brahma the Prajapati is called Hiranyagarbha, "he of the womb of gold," to denote his creative powers.42 The cosmo- gonic myth then postulated a golden egg instead of a golden womb,43 and this symbol was replaced in turn by the image of the god of the golden seed, an epithet of Agni and of Siva.44 By the time of the Epic, Siva was also given the original Vedic epithet, "the golden womb,"45 together with the golden seed.46 The com- 40 MHB III.213.41-52, III.214.1-17, III.219.1-15. 41 Brahmdnda 2.27.36-37; Haracarita 10.78; Siva, Dharmasamhita 10.195. 42 Rg Veda X.121.1; Atharva Veda X.5.19; Taittiriya Samhitd 5.5.1.2; Satapatha Brdhmana 6.2.2.5. 43aatapatha 11.i.6.1 and 6.1.1.10; Manu 1.8-9. 44 Amarakosa (Bombay: Government Central Book Depot, 1896), 1.58. 45 MHB I, Appendix 28, No. 1, 1. 188, and MHB XII.291.12 and 17. 46 Liiga 1.20.80-86. 7</page><page sequence="8">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva mentary on this epithet of Siva says, "First he created the waters, and released his seed in them, and that became the golden egg. In the form of Agni, he created the golden universal egg by shedding his seed."47 As the passage implies, the golden egg was the earlier concept, and the golden seed was transferred from Agni to Siva. But another text describes the situation in reverse, maintaining that when Agni bore Siva's seed for 5,000 years (before the birth of Kumara) his body became entirely golden, and so Agni became known as the bearer of the golden seed.48 In fact, both Siva and Agni derive this property from the Vedic Prajapati. F. ?IVA AND BRAHMA: OPPOSITION AND IDENTITY Siva has attracted to himself many of the roles and characteristics of Brahma, the creator, the giver of seed. In many of the later creation myths, Siva comes forth to help Brahma, usually in the form of an androgyne,49 but originally, Brahma himself was the androgyne.50 In many of the early creation myths, Brahma's sons, devoted to the performance of tapas for Siva refuse to participate in creation. 11 In a later reversal, Brahma himself plays the part of the ascetic son, to be replaced in turn by Siva, as the creative son: "Siva commanded Brahma to create, but Brahma did not; he meditated upon Siva for the sake of knowledge, and Siva was pleased by Brahma's tapas and gave him the Vedas. But Brahma still could not create, and so he again performed tapas, and Siva offered him a boon, and Brahma asked Siva to be his son."51 And in a still later layer of the mythology, Brahma again supplants the ascetic Rudra.# The balance shifts constantly between the two. 1. RUDRA VERSUS PRAJAPATI Although in several of the popular religious traditions of India Siva is himself associated with the incest typical of a primeval creator,52 in traditional Sanskrit literature he is famed primarily 47 MHB XIII.17.40 (Bombay); XIII.17.39 (Poona). 48 Vdmana 57.9-10. 49 Vdyu 1.9.68-70; Linga 1.70.324-27; Visnu 1.7.12-13. 50 Satapatha 14.4.2; Manu 1.32; Visnu 1.7.14.

The Vedic incest myth does not mention Rudra, but commentators have identified him with the avenger in the original myth, and he is specifically active as such in the later versions. The incest myth supplies much of the imagery of the Kumara birth story (in which Siva himself takes over the role of Prajapati) as well as the plot elements of the later addition to that story, the conflict between Siva and Kama (in which Siva maintains his role as opponent of Prajapati).** Thus the Puranic tradition rearranges elements of the Vedic myth in such a manner that Siva plays the role of the original sexual pro- tagonist as well as the ascetic antagonist. The original myth is told in rather vague terms, like so much of the .Rg Veda, and may in fact refer not to Brahma and his daughter but merely to heaven and the dawn: "When the father, bent upon impregnating his own daughter, united with her and discharged his seed on the earth, the benevolent gods generated prayer; they fashioned Vastospati, the protector of sacred rites."53 The father and the protector are not named, but the commentary elaborates: "Rudra Prajapati created Rudra Vastospati with a portion of himself," identifying Rudra even here with both the protector and the creator. Four other verses in the Rg Veda seem to refer to this myth and to connect it with Agni: "[As] he [Agni] made the seed for the great father, heaven... the hunter shot him as he em- braced his own daughter. Heaven laid the bright seed aside and Agni brought forth a youth. The father, heaven, impregnated his own daughter. The sacrificer into the fire committed incest with his own daughter."54 The connection with Rudra is made explicit later in the Brah- manas, which retained all the essentials of the Rg Vedic story- the incest, the seed shed upon the earth or into fire, and the punish- ment-and applied the myth to Prajapati: "Prajapati desired his daughter. He went to her, and his seed fell. He shed it in her. Then he heated it so that it would not spoil. He made it into all the animals."55 This brief story is expanded in another Brahmana: Prajapati desired his daughter.... The gods said, "Prajapati is doing something that is not to be done." They assembled various dreadful forms Studies in the Cult of the Goddess Manasd (Calcutta, 1966), pp. 191-200; Edward C. Dimock, Jr., and A. K.

He pierced him, and Prajapati fled up- wards.... The seed of Prajapati poured out, and became a lake. The gods said, "Let not the seed of Prajapati be ruined." They surrounded it with fire. The winds agitated it, and Agni made it move. The kindled seed be- came the sun; the blazing sparks became various sages, and the ashes vari- ous animals. Rudra claimed that what remained was his, but the gods deprived him of a claim.56 The Kumara story is a further expansion upon these themes. The seed of Prajapati (8iva) falls in a woman who cannot bear it (the daughter, or Parvati). It forms a lake (or is placed in the Ganges) and is surrounded by fire (swallowed by Agni), whereupon it be- comes productive. 2. BRAHMA VERSUS EKMA In the creation myths composed at the time of the Epic, the "desire" which Brahma felt for his daughter was personified as Kama. Kama then took the responsibility for the incestuous act (which even at the time of the Brahmanas was hard for some to accept as the fault of Brahma himself)57 and was punished by Siva as Brahma Prajapati was punished by Rudra. The punishment of Kama by Siva is generally implied but not narrated in the Brah- ma-Kama story, and it is in fact a separate motif, one which was known at the time of the Epic but only incorporated into Brahma's story by the time of the Puranas.tt A typical version of this myth relates it to the theme of androgynous creation: Brahma, in order to create the worlds, meditated and prayed; he broke his body into two parts, half male and half female. When he saw the woman, who was Savitri, Brahma marvelled at her beauty and was excited by the arrows of Kama, the male half of the androgyne. His sons reviled Brahma, saying, "This is your daughter," but Brahma continued to gaze at her face and even sprouted five heads in order to see her better. All the tapas that Brahma had amassed for the sake of creation was destroyed by his desire for his daughter. Then Brahma said to his sons, "Create gods and demons and men," and when they had gone to create, Brahma made love to his daughter. After 100 years she gave birth to a son, Manu.... Then Brahma was ashamed of his excessive desire for his own daughter, and he cursed Kama, saying, "Since your arrows excited my heart, Rudra will soon reduce your body to ashes." Then Kama appeased Brahma, argu- ing that he had merely acted as Brahma had instructed him to do. Brahma promised Kama that he would become incarnate again, and Kama departed, in sorrow because of the curse and in joy because of the remission.58 56 Aitareya Brdhmana 13.9-10; cf.

The male half of the androgyne, who was originally Brahma, then Rudra, is now Kama.t: And in keeping with his new character, he incites but does not participate in the act of in- cest. Kama here replaces Rudra in another sense as well; for just as Rudra pierces Prajapati with an arrow to punish him for his in- cestuous act, so Kama pierces Brahma with an arrow to cause that act. Brahma also fills several of the roles of Rudra; for he acts as chastiser (of Kama) as well as chastised, bringing upon Kama the curse of a punishment that Rudra (Siva) will later fulfil. Rudra then does not revile Brahma. This part of the role is played by Brahma's sons, who act on behalf of the ascetic, antierotic Siva as they often do. In many versions of the myth, Siva himself appears at the scene of the crime to laugh at Brahma and to mock him at great length.59 3. BRAHMA VERSUS vIVA The myth of the beheading of Brahma by Siva is very popular in India, primarily because it extols the virtue of the Kapalika ("skull bearer") cult and of Benares ("Kapalamocana," "the free- ing of the skull") as a shrine of expiation. The particular basis of the conflict underlying the beheading is the lust of Brahma; this is not clear from later versions of the myth, but may be seen in certain early versions. The head that Siva removes is the fifth head of Brahma, which appeared in the first place because of Brahma's incestuous lust. It is due to lust that it is destroyed: Brahma was dwelling in a lotus, trying to create. From his mouth a beauti- ful woman appeared; Brahma was tortured by desire, grabbed her by force, and demanded that she relieve his agony by making love with him. In anger she said to him, "This fifth head is inauspicious on your neck. Four faces would be more suitable for you." Then she vanished, and the fire of Brah- ma's anger burnt all the water on earth. Rudra then appeared and attacked the fifth head of Brahma with his nails; he took up the severed head and became known as the Kapalin [skull bearer]; he wandered over all the sacred places on earth until he came to Kapalamocana in Benares, where the skull fell from his hand and he was purified. The gods praised him, and Siva the Kapalin created from his own mouth a part of himself, born with- out a woman, a man who was an ascetic and who wandered over the earth, teaching the Aghora [Kapalika] path.60 The woman in this myth, created by Brahma, must be his daugh- t$ See Part I, Section B9. 59 iva 2.2.2.15-42, 2.2.3.1-78, 2.2.4.1-34; Kdlikd 1.24-65, 2.1-59, 3.1-49; Mahdbhdgavata 21.35-45; Skanda 5.2.13.1-20. 60 Bhavisya 3.4.13.1-19. 11</page><page sequence="12">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of ?iva ter, though she is not explicitly mentioned as such. Rudra pun- ishes Brahma for his incest, not for his impiety or pride as in the later versions. The framework of the story is that of the creation myth in which Brahma attempts to create, fails, and then is assisted by Rudra-who in this myth helps Brahma by cutting off the head that interfered with the process of creation. In another version, Brahma's incest is a direct cause of the severing of the fifth head: Brahma desired Sarasvati and went to her, asking her to stay with him. She, being his daughter, was furious at this and said, "Your mouth speaks inauspiciously and so you will always speak in a contrary way." From that day, Brahma's fifth head spoke evilly and coarsely. Therefore one day when Siva was wandering about with Parvati and came to see Brahma, Brahma's four heads praised Siva but his fifth head made an evil sound. Siva, dis- pleased with the fifth head, cut it off. The skull remained stuck fast to 8iva's hand, and though he was capable of burning it up, Siva wandered the earth with it for the sake of all people, until he came to Benares.61 The secondary cause of the beheading-the insult to Siva-is here combined with the primary cause-the daughter's curse, and the pious storyteller justifies Siva's expiation by the argument from bhakti,?? his willing submission "for the sake of all people." Here, as in the first version of the Kapalika myth, Siva's aggressive act is not only justified but considered a favor to Brahma, ridding him of an inauspicious head. The act of beheading, however, is antagonistic, as is obvious from the context as well as the back- ground myth of incest. The Abbe Dubois records another version of the myth, which restores the sexual basis of the antagonism: "Brahma.. . was born with five heads, but he outraged Parvati, the wife of Siva, and Siva avenged himself by striking off one of the heads of the adulterous god in single combat."62 There does not seem to be any Sanskrit version of this myth, but the process of substituting Parvati for the original woman is neatly paralleled by the popular tradition which makes Parvati (instead of the sages' wives) the one with whom Agni commits adultery.63 As Brahma and Agni are often confused with Siva in the mythology, such a transference is not surprising. In fact, the confusion of Siva with Brahma is the 61 Siva, Jinnasamhita 49.65-80. ?? See Part I, Section Al. 62 Abb6 J. A. Dubois, Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies, trans. and ed. H. K.

One day Brahma came to Parvati and she, mistaking him for Siva because he had five heads, fed him. Siva returned and criticized Parvati for feeding Brahma before his return; Parvati asked Siva to cut off one of Brahma's heads so that she could dis- tinguish between them. He did so, and, holding the head in his hand, he be- came mad and roamed through the burning places. Then Parvati took the head in her own hand and became mad; she is revived by the sound of the temple drum.64 Siva is frequently called Paicavaktra ("having five heads"), and is so portrayed in the iconography, but it is unusual to see such an explicit reference to the coincidence of attributes between two different gods. The real basis of the beheading is retained as an undercurrent of the myth, however. Parvati's inability to distin- guish between the two gods would give rise to a sexual conflict between them (here masked by the reference to her "feeding" Brahma) similar to the incestuous conflict which underlies the Sanskrit versions of the tale. 4. THE COMPETITION BETWEEN BRAHMA AND SIVA The sexual basis of the competition between the two gods is re- vealed in a version of the creation myth which incorporates the great myth of their conflict-the myth of the flame liiga: Brahma and Visnu asked Rudra to create. He said, "I will do it," and then he plunged into the water for a thousand years. Brahma and Vis.u began to worry, and Visnu said, "There is not much time left. You must make an effort to create." Brahma then made all the gods and demons and the other beings. When Siva emerged from the water, about to begin creation, he saw that the universe was full. He thought, "What will I do? Creation has already been achieved by Brahma. Therefore I will destroy it and tear out my own seed." So saying, he released a flame from his mouth, setting the universe on fire. Eventually Brahma propitiated Siva, who agreed to place in the sun the dangerous fire that he had emitted. Then Siva broke off his linga, saying, "There is no use for this linga except to create creatures." He threw the linga upon the earth and it broke through the earth and went down to Hell and up to the heavens. Viinu and Brahma tried in vain to find the top and bottom of it, and they worshipped it.65 In this myth, Siva is castrated not in punishment for some sexual offense-as he is in the Pine Forest-but as evidence of the lack of that very sexuality. Death is necessitated by the fulness of the closed universe; when Siva discovers that he is not needed as a 64Told by the temple drummer (Pombaikaran) of Dharanpuram, Kongu; personal communication from Brenda E.

Siva's refusal to create is symbol- ized by his castration, but this too is ambivalent, for it results in the fertility cult of liiga worship. The basis of the feud between Siva and Brahma is not in this instance the conflict between the ascetic and the incestuous creator, but between the two different valid forms of creation: Siva opposes the Prajapati because he is himself a Prajapati. This is clear from yet another myth of their conflict. When, at the wedding of Siva and Sati, Brahma is overcome with lust for the bride and even spills his seed66 (as he does at the sight of his daughter in the incest myth, of which the wedding myth is a variant), Siva wishes to kill Brahma. Visnu, trying to restrain him, argues: "Brahma was born to perform creation; if he is killed, there can be no other natural creator." But Siva replies, "I must kill this terrible sinner, but I myself will then create all beings, or by my own seed I will create another creator."67 This competition between creators, one of them ascetic and the other sexual, is re- flected in Ruben's interpretation of the Kapalin myth: "Siva cut off the head of the Creator God, Brahma, in order to become the creator himself."68 This competition is clarified in another version of the creation myth: Brahma wished to create, but he did not know how to do it. He became angry, and Rudra was born from his anger. Brahma gave Rudra a beautiful maiden for his wife, named Gauri [Parvati], and Rudra rejoiced when he received her. Then Brahma forbade Rudra to do tapas at the time of crea- tion, saying, "Rudra, you must perform creation." But Rudra said, "I am unable," and he plunged into the water, for he thought, "One without tapas is not able to create creatures." Then Brahma took Gauri back; and, wish- ing to create, he made seven mind-born sons, Daksa and his brothers. He gave Gauri to Daksa for a daughter, though she had been formerly promised in marriage to Rudra. Daksa rejoiced and began a great sacrifice which all the gods attended. Then, after 10,000 years, Rudra arose from the water, and by the power of his tapas he saw all the world before him with its forests and men and beasts, and he heard the chanting of the priests in Daksa's sacrifice. Then he became furious and he said, "Brahma created me and in- structed me to perform creation. Who is doing that work now ?" and flames issued forth from his ears and turned into ghosts and goblins and various weapons. Rudra destroyed Daksa's sacrifice, but he restored it again when the gods praised him. Daksa gave his daughter to Rudra as Brahma asked him to do, and Rudra took her with him to Kailasa mountain.69 Siva's position here is unambiguous: he rejects the wife he has 66 Siva 2.2.19.1-76; 2.2.20.1-25; 2.3.49.3-10; Siva, Jinnsamhita 18.62-68; Skanda 1.1.26.15-22; 6.77.16-75; Saura 59.54-61; Vdmana 53.56-59; Brahma 72.18. 67 Siva 2.2.19.58-60. 68 Ruben, Eisenschmiede, p. 207. 69 Varaha 1,21.1-88. 14</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions been given (though he is said to have rejoiced upon obtaining her) and does tapas because he is unable, rather than unwilling, to create without it. In the shorter version of this myth, Brahma takes care to tell him, "Create creatures to fill the universe; you are able to do this,"70 but Rudra disobeys him even then, and he clearly disagrees with him. The rejection of the woman who is the daughter of Daksa is the link used by the storyteller to introduce the related myth of the destruction of the sacrifice of Daksa, yet another variation on the theme of the conflict between Siva and Brahma; for Daksa is a Prajapati who replaces Brahmi in later mythology and who comes to represent sexual creation and incest vis-a-vis ascetic creation.71 Yet Siva does not reject the woman outright, nor does he reject creation-merely a particular aspect of it at a particular time. 5. THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF BRAHMA AND SIVA Siva's statement that he will become the destroyer, since there is already a creator, is typical of the series of myths in which Siva, having been forbidden to create immortals, refuses to create mortals and henceforth refuses to create at all.721 11[ A strong Saiva bias usually prevails in these myths, and Siva is not condemned for his passionlessness, as the ascetic sons of Brahma usually are. But this reversal is only possible because the second path-sexual creation-is understood to be practiced by someone else, in this case Brahma. The sons in the earlier myth are censured only when they are at that time the only possible source of creation. Thus, later Hinduism resolves the conflict with another division, not into cycles but into different persons, or rather different aspects of the one person who in the other context simply passes through differ- ent phases. Brahma accomplishes sexual creation and Siva devotes himself to asceticism; the universe is supplied with mortality and immortality. Moreover, by refusing to create mortals or creatures subject to sickness and old age, Siva indulges in a kind of preventa- tive euthanasia, a reversal of the reversal, so that the net result of his action is creative after all. 70 Vardha 1.33.4. 71Siva 2.2.19.56, 2.2.42.22-29; Lingga 1.63.2; Bhdgavata 4.2.22-23, 4.7.3; Skanda 4.2.87-89, 7.2.9.42; Vdyu 1.30.61; Vardha 1.33.1-33; Devibhdgavata 7.30.27-37; Kitrma 1.14.61; Harivamsa (Bombay: Laksmi-Venkatesvara Steam Press, 1833-76), 3.22.1-7. 72 MHB VII, Appendix 1, No. 8, 11. 70-131; Matsya 4.30-32; Vdyu 1.10.42-59; Brahmdnda 2.9.68-92; Siva 7.14; Liiga 1.6.10-22; Skanda 7.2.9.5-17; Kiurma 1.10.17-40. I See Part I, Section B9. 15</page><page sequence="16">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva The complementarity of the two creative methods is clear from this variation: Brahma created the mind-born sages, who remained celibate and refused to create. Brahma then created Rudra from his anger, and he gave him various wives and told him to become a Prajapati and to create progeny with the wives he had received. Rudra created creatures like himself who swallowed up the universe on all sides, burning up the skies with their blaz- ing eyes. Prajapati was frightened and said, "No more of these creatures; do tapas for the sake of all creatures, and create the universe as it was before." Siva agreed, and he went to the forest to do tapas. Then Brahma created his mental sons and Kama.73 Here Siva's act of creation is directly connected with death. Only creation by tapas is acceptable from Rudra, and Brahma supple- ments this method with his sexual creation and with the creation of Kama, to preserve the balance. Thus Brahma and Siva participate in aspects of each other so deeply that they exchange roles almost at random. Siva often acts for or instead of Brahma, and his opposition to Brahma is often based upon similarity of purpose. In many of the later myths, sexual creation is personified as Kama. And just as Brahma op- poses Kama and curses him, so Siva brings about the realization of that curse, partly as the ascetic in opposition to Brahma (resist- ing the attacks of Kama that Brahma has directed) and partly as an extension of Brahma (chastising Kama as Brahma cursed him to be chastised). Moreover, just as Brahma both curses Kama and restores him, so Siva too destroys Kama, but simultaneously participates in Kama's nature and increases his power. In this way, the complex identity-opposition relation between Brahma and the various aspects of Siva underlies much of what appears to be paradoxical in the later mythology of Siva. G. SIVA AND KAMA The conflict between Siva and Kama is a central point of the Saiva Puranas. In the later texts, Kama is sent against Siva by Brahma, merely out of spite and in revenge against Siva for chastising Brahma's incestuous behavior, as well as against Kama for caus- ing this behavior.74 In the earlier Puranas, however, Kama is sent by Indra to cause Siva to marry and beget the son needed by the gods. And in a still earlier era, before Siva became the ascetic par 73 Bhdgavata 3.12.1-26. 74 Brhaddharma 2.53.40-41; Mahdbhdgavata 12-28; Siva 2.2.8.12-22; Skanda 5.2.13. 16</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions excellence, Indra sent Kama (or his assistants, the apsaras-es) to seduce ascetics in order to reduce the threat of their powers. In the context of the Kumara story, where the Kama-8iva conflict takes place, this episode is late.75 The birth of Kumara resulted first from the incestuous seed of Prajapati, then from Agni's seduction of the sages' wives, and then from the gods' need for a general. Yet most of the Puranas include the episode of Kama, and it is highly significant for Saiva mythology. Moreover, though the episode it- self is comparatively late, the interaction of the forces which Siva and Kama represent-namely tapas and kdma-is central to Indian culture from the time of the Vedas and even before. Due to the remarkable continuity of that culture, the more elaborate and explicit myths of the Puranas may in fact capture and explain, as they claim to do, the often obscure meaning of the ancient tales. 1. THE CHASTITY OF SIVA-AND ITS CONTRADICTION Siva is the natural enemy of Kama because he is the epitome of chastity, the eternal brahmacdrin, his seed drawn up,76 the very incarnation of chastity.77 When Himalaya brings his daughter Parvati to Siva, Siva objects with the traditional argument of misogyny: "This girl with her magnificent buttocks must not come near me; I insist upon this. Wise men know that a woman is the very form of Enchantment, especially a young woman, the destruction of ascetics. I am an ascetic, a yogi; what use have I for a woman ? An ascetic must never have contact with women."78 Because of his chastity, Siva is considered the one man in the uni- verse who can resist Kama. When Brahma plots to have Siva seduced, he says, "But what woman in the triple world could enter his heart, cause him to abandon yoga, and delude him? Even Kama will not be able to delude him, for Siva is a perfect yogi and cannot bear even to hear women mentioned."79 But each of these statements is merely a thesis to be answered with an antithesis: Siva's chastity is set against his lust, his invulnerability against his susceptibility. Many of the myths illustrating the chastity of 75 A comparatively early reference to the burning of Kama by fiva appears in an inscription of A.D. 473-74, cited in John Faithfull Fleet, Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and Their Successors ("Corpus inscriptionum indicarum," Vol. III [Calcutta: Superintendent of Government Printing, 1888]), No. 18, p. 81, pl. xi, 11. 21-23. 76 MHB XIII.17.45 and 72. 77 Kumdrasambhava 5.30. 78 iva 2.3.12.28-33. 79 iva 2.2.8.17-18; cf.

One Saiva tale apparently in praise of Siva's chastity is an elaboration upon the myth in which 8iva enlightens Visnu and causes him to leave the form of the boar in which he has married the Earth.# In this version, the Earth is replaced by a group of demon women, but the troublesome sons remain: Once when Viniu had driven the demons back to Hell, he happened to see there a group of beautiful women; struck by the arrows of desire, he stayed there and made love to the women, engendering in them sons that troubled the world. To save the gods, Siva took the form of a bull; he entered Hell, bellowing, and killed Vi.nu's sons. Then he enlightened Visnu, saying, "You must not indulge yourself sexually here, a slave to desire, dependent upon women." The other gods wished to enter Hell to see the voluptuous women, but Siva pronounced a curse, saying, "Except for a perfectly controlled sage or a demon born of me, whoever enters this place will die." Thus Visnu the supreme womanizer was chastised by Siva, and the universe became happy.80 Siva's position in this myth is fairly unequivocal in its chastity, but even here he assumes the form of a bull, the emblem of sexuality, instead of the mythical sarabha beast of the boar myth, and he cleverly modifies the curse to allow himself ("the perfectly controlled sage") and his sons to enjoy the demon women. The second variant elaborates upon this aspect of Siva until the whole point of the myth is reversed. After repeating the above myth with some minor variations, it continues: After Siva had pronounced the curse and the gods had returned to heaven, some time passed. Then one day, when Siva was rapt in thought and Parvati asked him what he was thinking about, Siva said, "I am thinking about the beauty of the women of Hell, the most beautiful women in the universe." Parvati wanted to see them for herself; she went to Hell and said to the women there, "You are like poisonous vines, for your beauty is of no use. Prajapati created women for the sake of the sexual enjoyment of men, but giva cursed your husbands, forbidding them to enter here. Now let my sons, Siva's hosts, wise ascetics, be your husbands. [The commentator adds: 'They are ascetics, and so 8iva has not forbidden their entrance here']. Make love with them." Then she vanished. Thus Visnu the supreme woman- izer sported with the demon women in Hell.81 The reversal of the myth is clear from the reversal of the final line, where Visnu's sport, rather than his chastisement, is remembered. Siva himself cannot help thinking about the women, and the ambivalence of his position is revealed in the variant provided by his sons-who are allowed to make love to the demon women be- ## See Part I, Section B1. 80 Siva 3.22.45-55; 3.23.1-36. 81 Siva, Dharmasapmhita 9.46-61.</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions cause of their status as ascetics and their supposed chastity. But this paradox is a description of the contradictory nature of Siva himself. Indeed, it is almost impossible to find a myth in which Siva re- mains chaste throughout, though many myths are based upon the initial premise of his chastity. Even in the Mahdbhirata passage which describes him as the chaste brahmacdrin, Siva is praised as the god who "sports with the daughters and the wives of the sages, with erect hair, a great penis, naked, with an excited look. ... All the gods worship his liiiga."82 2. THE BURNING OF KAMA-AND THE REVIVAL The destruction of the god of desire would seem to be an unequivo- cally antisexual act, and that is in fact its original significance. The Mahdbhdrata says: "The great brahmacdrin, Siva, did not devote himself to the pleasures of lust; the husband of Parvati extinguished Kama when Kama attacked him, making Kama bodiless."83 Yet even here, the chastiser of Kama is simultaneously called the husband of Parvati, the erotic aspect of Siva. Through- out the Puranas, the meaning of the conquest of Kama by Siva is undercut by qualifying episodes and even complete reversals: Siva burns Kama only to revive him in a more powerful form; Siva burns Kama but is nevertheless sexually aroused; Siva burns Kama and is therefore a desirable lover; Siva is himself burnt by Kama; and, the final Hindu complication, Siva is Kama. Rebirth from fire is a generally accepted theme in Hinduism,84 and ashes are a particularly potent form of seed.85 The ashes of Kama, when smeared upon Siva's body in place of the usual fun- eral ashes, arouse great desire in him.86 Thus Kama's rebirth from his ashes is not surprising; in the Hindu tradition, the burning it- self implies the revival. Even in the simple context of the myth, Kama's power is not destroyed when Siva burns him. Kama re- mains "Anaiga," bodiless, but is said to retain his sexual func- tion.87 Later, he is actually revived and given a new body, a new incarnation. 82 MHB XIII, Appendix 1, No. 4, 11. 66-67, and XIII.14.101-2. 83 MHB XII.183.10.3-5. 84 catapatha Brdhmana 2.2.4.8. 85 Ibid., 6.8.2.1-2 and 6; Padma 4.103.1-26; Brahmdnda 2.27.112-13; Linga 1.34.1-3 and 7-8; Siva, Jiinnasa.mhita 48.86-89; Dani6lou, op. cit., p. 218. 86 Brhaddharma 2.53.45-46; Kdlikd 44.125-26, 45.117-18; Mahdbhdgavata 24.1-8.

She herself is the essence of Kama even when Kama is destroyed; when Kama was burnt and became bodiless, his essence entered into her limbs.91 Usually, this reincarnation is merely a metaphor: "May the water of Siva's sweat, fresh from the embrace of Gauri, which Kama employs as his aqueous weapon because of his fear of the fire of Siva's eye, protect you."92 Parvati is of course a particularly apt form for Kama to assume, as it was for her sake that he was burnt and it was her lover who burnt him, but the poetic image is ex- tended to other women as well,93 particularly to the wives of the Pine Forest sages: "One woman, strewing flowers before him, seemed to be the flower-bow of Kama, which had assumed her form when it was frightened by the eye in Siva's forehead.... Another woman teased Siva, saying, 'Did you open the fiery eye in your forehead and burn Kama?' to which he replied, 'I am in- deed made a laughingstock when he is reborn in your gaze, lovely one.' "94 The revival of Kama for the sake of Siva's honeymoon already indicates that Siva has undergone a change of heart, so it is not surprising that the reborn Kama has powers over Siva that he did not have before Siva destroyed him.95 Siva reincarnates Kama with a half of Siva's embodied essence in him,96 or he makes Kama one of his own hosts.97 In one version of the myth, Siva revives Kama at the wedding and gives him permission to use his arrows even against Siva himself.98 When the goddess revives Kama, she promises him: "Siva will lose his control because of you, and though his hatred of passion will make him angry at you, he will not be able to burn you, and he will marry Parvatl."

THE EROTIC APPEAL OF THE CHASTISER OF KAMA Many texts imply that Siva was wounded by Kama at the time when he supposedly destroyed Kama.100 Siva himself often admits that he is in the power of Kama,101 and his supposed conquest of Kama is often cited satirically when Siva is erotically engaged :102 "So now this Safkara [giva], whose asceticism is known through all the world, fearful of absence from his mistress, bears her in his very form. And they say that we were overcome by him!" Victory to Love, who with these words presses Priti's [Rati's] hand and falls to laughter.103 The basis of the satire is the same as that of the false ascetic; be- cause of his reputation for chastity, Siva's seduction is all the more to the credit of Kama and to the seductress. In praising Parvati's beauty, Narada says, "She caused Siva, who is without passion and is the enemy of Kama, to wander like a minnow lost in the depths of her loveliness.'104 This "lack of passion" makes Siva all the more desirable, as it does the conventional ascetic.*** The women of Himalaya's city marvel at Siva's beauty and say, "Kama's body was not burnt by Siva when his anger mounted, but I think that out of shame when he saw Siva, Kama himself burnt his body."105 It is his supposed invulnerability to desire that causes Parvati to desire Siva; she wants him for her husband because he has destroyed Kama. Although everyone cites the burning of Kama when trying to dissuade her from her love of Siva,106 Parvati merely laughs and replies, "This passionless Siva, who burnt Kama, will be won by my tapas, for he is loving to his devotees."107 But the bhakti argument is superfluous here, for the contradiction 99 Brahmdnda 4.30.58-61 and 71-84; cf.

Kalidasa expresses this resolution in metaphor: Though Kama's body was destroyed by Siva's eye, his arrow, unable to reach its goal and repelled by Siva's unbearable cry of defiance, wounded Parvati deeply in her heart.108 Thus Parvati desires Siva because he has destroyed Desire. And when she has won him, the poet describes her as "naively smiling when they say that he hates Love."109 In the midst of another erotic adventure, Siva remarks, "Kama is attacking me, remem- bering our former enmity."ll0 Thus Siva admits that his "de- struction" of Kama has merely added to Kama's power over him. 4. THE LUST OF THE CHASTISER OF KAMA Even without the episodes of the revival of Kama or the eventually successful attack waged by him, the very act of burning Kama betrays Siva's vulnerability and innately erotic nature. Siva is highly aroused by Kama before he can regain control of himself.111 Siva himself muses upon this phenomenon: "How can I lust to make love to Parvati when she has not performed a vow of tapas ? And how is it that I wish to rape her ? How can I have been excited by desire when I do not wish it right now? For some reason I seem to be attracted to this girl and to wish to unite with her."112 When Kama uses various magical wiles to arouse Siva, entering his heart in the form of the humming of bees or shooting him with flower arrows, Siva regains his composure with great effort by various techniques of yoga.13 The subduing of lust is an import- ant part of yoga philosophy, which emphasizes that the lust must be present in the first place for the yogi to work upon :ttt "Once the mind has stimulated the power of sex, the yogi cannot recover his mastery over himself, the brilliance of his inner light, until he has burned up lust by bringing the power of his seed up to the fifth center."ll4 Just as Kama's body is preserved in its essence in the ashes on the chest of the ascetic, so the power of lust within the 108 Kumdrasambhava 5.54. 109 Subhdsitaratnakosa No. 65. 110 Kdlika 52.112. 111 Siva, Jiinnasam.hita 9-18, 10.73; Siva 2.3.18; Skanda 1.1.21, 5.2.13; Vdmana 6; Matsya 154.237-38. 112 Kdlikd 44.110-12. 113 Matsya 154.235-48; Haracarita 9.53-57; Skanda 5.2.13.27-35. ttt See Part I, Section D3. 114 R.

The original presence of the emotion of lust is implied in 8iva's violent reaction to Kama; were he totally impervious, he would not even have bothered to burn Kama.1l5 A Ceylonese version of the burning of Kama makes explicit this vulnerability of Siva: Maha Ishvara [8iva] is God. Uma his wife lives in his turban because from the turban it is very easy to have sexual intercourse. One day Uma saw a man of great beauty. She had sex relations with the man. When Maha Ish- vara heard of this he was angry and gazed on the man with his third eye. The man was reduced to ashes. Uma craved Maha Ishvara's pardon and begged him to recreate the man. The man was recreated but he was without genitals.116 Here, Siva injures Kama not because Kama has tried to inspire lust in him, but because he has tried to interfere with it. The re- versal of the usual roles is revealed by the nature of the punish- ment inflicted upon Kama: castration, which is the central motif of many of the myths of Siva. The significance of this punishment in this context, and its pertinence to both Siva and Kama, arises from the theme of the destruction (or castration) and resurrection of the fertility god, Siva or Kama. Meyer suggests that the myth of Siva's burning of Kama stems from the Indo-Germanic rite of burning the tree that symbolizes the daemon of fertility (the ancient "Indra pole"), and that this burning was later replaced by the self-castration of the god.117 Thus, just as Siva's castration is pro- creative, releasing into the universe at large the power of his linga, so his burning of Kama is ultimately conducive to fertility. 5. THE PARTIAL IDENTITY OF SIVA AND KAMA In a relationship similar to that which characterizes his conflict with Brahma, Siva opposes Kama in part due to their opposition as ascetic and erotic gods, but in part also because of their com- petition as fertility gods. The argument used to make Brahma retract his curse upon Kama is used to make Siva revive him: "Have mercy toward Kama. It was you who created him and who instructed him in the very action which he has performed, using the ability that you gave him."ll8 The South Indian tradition 115 SubhdSitaratnakosa No. 4. 116 Nur 0.

The complexity of the manner in which Kama, Siva, Brahma, and Agni-all representing different aspects of creation-assume one another's roles may be seen in a version of the burning of Kama which transposes almost every episode of the myth, begin- ning with what is usually the end: the gods beg Siva to marry and beget a son; Siva refuses to have anything to do with a woman, but he gives them his seed [tejas, fiery glory], placed in Agni, and returns to his meditation. Only at this point does Kama appear: The gods went with giva's seed and told Brahma what had happened; Brahma laughed, and from his mouth Kama appeared, born from Brahma's creative heat [tejas]. Kama's power [tejas] caused men and women every- where to unite, tortured by lust, but Siva created a great ascetic fire [tejas] from his third eye and assuaged that sickness. Kama became angry at this, and, taking up his arrows, he filled Siva with desire. Siva married Parvati, the yogini, and made love to her for a thousand years. The gods, afraid that the world would be destroyed, went there and praised Siva. giva and Par- vati were ashamed and angry, and a great heat arose from them. The gods fled, but Kama alone remained there, unafraid; the fire of giva's anger burnt Kama to ashes, but Rati propitiated Siva so that he promised to re- vive Kama with a half of his own essence.125 Almost every element of the basic myth has been transposed: the 119 R.

In fact, the burning of Kama replaces the "burning" of Agni (i.e., the cursing of Agni to bear the burning seed), which has already taken place at the beginning of the whole sequence. This exchange of roles evolves from the basic similarity and flexibility of the characters involved, all of whom epitomize some aspect of tejas, the fiery power to create or destroy: tejas is Agni; it is the burning seed of Siva, the creative laugh of Brahma, the power of Kama to inspire desire, the power generated by the love making of Siva and Par- vati, and the fire of Siva's third eye. All of these are essential to the myth, no matter at what place in the myth they may occur. As Siva and Kama are both creators, their roles are closely intertwined in the creation myths, as are the roles of Siva and Brahma. In one version of the androgynous creation, Kama is the male half instead of Siva,126??? and Brahma creates Kama in order to proceed with eternal creation, just as he enlists the aid of Rudra when his ascetic sons fail him. Creation usually proceeds from a combination of the erotic and ascetic powers; so the ulti- mate power of Kama is derived from the force of his original essence strengthened by the contact with Siva: Siva reduced Kama to ashes, and the fire from his third eye then yawned wide to burn the universe. But then, for the sake of the world, Siva dis- persed that fire among mangoes and the moon and flowers and bees and cuckoos-thus he divided the fire of Kama. That fire which had pierced Siva inside and outside, kindling passion and affection, serves to arouse people who are separated, reaching the hearts of lovers, and it blazes night and day, hard to cure.127 Kama's power is thus no longer concentrated in one anthropomor- phic form but is diffused into the world, like the demons from Pandora's box. It is only by "destroying" Kama that Siva re- leases the full power of Kima, the more compelling as it is aug- mented by contact with Siva's own force.

The phrase "the fire of Kama" is a pun, denoting the fire used by Kama and against him as well. The image of the intermingling fires (transmuted into the mango and cuckoo) appears in a classical verse: Within the wood the cuckoos charm the heart with warbling of their throats grown strong from eating of fresh mango buds. What here pretend to be their eyes, if but the truth were known, are sparks fanned by the flames of Siva's glance from the coals of burning Love.128 Yet, in spite of all the examples of the interchanging roles of the two gods and the intermingling of their powers, it is clear that whereas Kama is merely one aspect of Siva, the reverse is not true. Siva is Kama-but he is more as well, and it is this "more" that opposes Kama. Siva is the god of virility, Kama the god of sensuality.129 Siva burns Kama because of Kama's frivolous approach to a matter which for Siva involves the procreation of the cosmos rather than the titillation which is Kama's stock in trade. When Parvati accuses Siva of taking no pleasure in Desire, Siva replies: "Our love is more than Desire; how could it be born of mere Desire ? Formerly, I made the universe by giving birth to Desire, and I myself made Desire for the sexual pleasure of each person. How then can you reproach me for burning Desire ? Kama thought that I was just like the other gods, and he disturbed my mind, and so I burnt him to ashes."'30 From this it appears that Siva objects not to Kama's essence, which he accepts as his own, but to Kama's particular way of manifesting it. Similarly, Brahma, who created Kama to excite creatures, cursed him not for doing so but for doing it at an in- appropriate time and place. Both Siva and Kama are fertility gods, but Siva is ascetic and destructive as well; and Siva has not merely assimilated the character of Kama, for Kama is a comparative latecomer to the Indian scene, and Siva's creative aspect is taken from Indra and Agni and Brahma long before the advent of Kama. It is in Agni in particular that Siva and Kama merge, both being aspects of the erotic fire, while Siva also represents the ascetic fire. 128 Subhd&amp;itaratnakosa No. 171. 129 p.

ASCETICS, HOUSEHOLDERS, AND FOREST-DWELLTTTRS IN 6AIVA MYTHOLOGY In some versions of the Pine Forest myth, Siva acts as an ascetic against the wives of the sages to make the sages devote themselves to more perfect tapas. In others he acts as an erotic god to shock the sages out of their tapas and back to their marital responsibili- ties. This confusion of purposes is strengthened by the ambiguity of Siva himself in this respect. Siva resolves these conflicts to a great extent within his own character, and the failure of the myth to come to a similar resolution with regard to his human counter- parts, the forest-dwellers, is due to the innate character of the myth, which, although free to pursue certain solutions impossible in the world of reality, must ultimately falter in the attempt to resolve a true social contradiction. ll 11 1 Siva himself opposes the compromise attempted by the forest-dwellers, striving in different versions to correct flaws either of asceticism or of worldliness, so that one goal does not eclipse the other. 1. SIVA VERSUS THE FOREST-DWELLERS Siva's opposition to the wives of the sages is based in part upon his character as the chaste, misogynist ascetic, but also upon the more generally held view that women can only cause trouble when they accompany their husbands to the forest, ### a theory which Siva proves by seducing them. Siva says, "Their wives are princesses proud of their beauty, and they befoul the sages' minds so that the sages curse whatever men enter the woods, in fear of the infidelity of their own wives .... Those 'ascetics' lust for their wives' lotus mouths."131 The sages themselves attribute their shortcomings to their marital status: "We have the wits of fools; the Self has not been revealed to the householder."132 Just as much evidence can be adduced for the opposite point of view-that Siva comes to the forest to teach the sages to give up their tapas and to devote themselves to their wives. Brahma says to the sages, "You live in a hermitage but you are overcome by anger and lust; yet the true hermitage of a wise man is his home, while for the man who is not a true yogi even the hermitage is merely a house.'l33 Agrawala sees in this myth the doctrine by I lII See Part I, Section Al. ## See Part I, Section C2. 131 Haracarita 10.27-188; Ydgi4varamdhatmya 27b.10. 132 Skanda 6.258.25-26. 133 Vdmana 43.87. 27</page><page sequence="28">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of ?iva which "one performs the ordained duties of the householder's life and thus obtains the objective of true renunciation,"134 that is, the traditional attempt to reconcile the two goals.**** This is Siva's familiar antiascetic role, the Dionysian aspect that he assumes in order to oppose the tapas of the sons of Brahma (who are the Pine Forest sages)135 and to send them back to the world of normal social involvement. In this way, both points of view are often expressed side by side in a single version, and almost all versions agree on a somewhat modified form of each extreme: Siva praises santi, calm self-control and lack of passion, even in versions which condemn violent tapas,136 and he teaches the value of linga worship even while criticizing excessive attachment to one's wife.137 He points out the insufficiency of mere tapas alone: "The sages are not free from emotions, though they have entered the forest and performed the rituals.... The smearing of ashes upon the body, the wearing of great matted locks, the bald head, garland of skulls, nakedness, the ochre robe-the whole vow is made vain by desire and anger. Being in such a state, they will not obtain Release by means of tapas, which merely dries up the body."138 Desire must be con- quered, not denied; it is by means of liiga worship that tapas be- comes successful; once the sages with their wives have worshiped his liiga, they succeed;139 yet they must honor the liiga while maintaining true chastity and great tapas.140 Tapas-with true chastity-and devotion to their wives-with liiga worship-each must be done in the proper way, and then they sustain rather than oppose each other. 2.

Mena, the mother of Parvati, scorns Siva because he is penniless and makes love to Parvati constantlyl41-that is, she sees him as a bad husband (poor) and a bad yogi (lascivious) rather than as a good husband (virile) and a good yogi (indifferent to material objects). Similarly, Daksa does not see Siva as one thing or another: "He is not primarily an ascetic, for how can an ascetic bear weapons as he does? And he cannot be counted among the householders, for he lives in a burning-ground. He is not a brahmacdrin, since he has married, and how could he be a forest-dweller, since he is deluded with pride in his supreme lordship [and a forest-dweller must give up all material ties] ? He belongs to none of the four classes, and is neither male nor female [because he is an androgyne]; and he certainly cannot be a eunuch, for his linga is an object of worship."142 A similar objection to Siva's unique behavior in the Pine Forest is the basis of the sages' curse: "This is not the kind of behavior proper for householders like us; nor is it the manner of those who are fond of chastity, nor of those who dwell in the forest. It is not the dharma for ascetics, either; it is not done anywhere."l43 The problem underlies the statement made by the Seven Sages to test Parvati: There are two kinds of pleasures in the world, mental and physical. Siva, being a disgusting beggar, is of no use for pleasures of the body, and, being inauspicious because of his necrophilic associations, he cannot even satisfy the longings of the mind.144 It is frequently said against Siva in the myths that he is a bad, or even a false, ascetic because of his involvement with Parvati. The demon Jalandhara mocks Siva: "How can you live on alms and yet keep the beautiful Parvati ? Give her to me, and wander from house to house with your alms bowl. You have fallen from your vow.... You are a yogi; what need have you for the gem of wives? You live in the woods attended by goblins and ghosts; being a naked yogi, you should give your wife to one who will appreciate her better than you do."145 This sexual involvement makes Siva vulnerable to his enemies and reduces his ascetic powers. The combination of roles works against him in the opposite 141 Vdyu 2.30.32. 142 Skanda 4.2.87.29-35. 143 Brahmdnda 2.27.28-29. 144 Matsya 154.330-39; Padma 5.40.322-33; Haracarita 9.96-100. 145 Padma 6.11.45-47, and 49, 6.11.25-26, 6.101.19-20; Skanda 2.4.17.18-19; Siva 2.5.19.8-9. 29</page><page sequence="30">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva way as well: a number of texts point out that, being an ascetic, Siva is a somewhat unsatisfactory husband.146 As Siva himself puts it: "I am the greatest of the eleven Rudras, the lord of yoga; how can I take a beautiful wife, a woman who is the very form of Illusion ? Any yogi ought to regard every woman as if she were his mother; I am a yogi; how can I marry a woman, my mother "147 In addition to the classical problems of the married yogi, Siva has certain other problems due to his immortality. This particu- larly complicates the knotty problem of the son of the ascetic: Parvati wished to have a natural son, but giva said, "I am not a house- holder, and I have no use for a son. The wicked gods presented me with a wife, but a wife is the most useless thing for a man who is without passion. Offspring are a noose and I will have none. Householders have need of a son and wealth; for them, a wife is necessary for the sake of a son, and sons are necessary to give the oblations to the ancestors. But I never die, and so I have no need for a son; when there is no disease, what use is medicine?" Still Parvati insisted, "What you say is true, but nevertheless I wish to have a child. When you have begotten a child, you can return to your yoga. I will take care of the son and you can be a yogi as you wish. I have a great desire for the kiss of a son's mouth, and since you have made me your wife you should beget a child upon me. If you wish, your son will be averse to marriage, so that you will not establish a whole lineage."'48 Thus a son is avoided by Siva for the very reason that mortals usually need one: for the sake of immortality through pro- geny.tttt The conflict cannot be resolved in cycles, as Parvati attempts to do in suggesting that the son will be chaste to make up for the sexual lapse of the father, because this involves the very chain of rebirth from which Siva, as the epitome of the yogi, has divorced himself and of which he, as a god, has no need. Nor can it be solved simply by the shorter phases of sex and yoga which alternate in the life of Sivat4:: (as she suggests, after begetting the child he may return to yoga, as he does after the birth of Skanda), for, as a mythological and symbolic figure, Siva is simul- taneously yogi and husband. In this particular instance, the solu- tion is the creation of a magical, unnatural child for Parvati, as the mortal solution was often the birth of an illegitimate child from the unnaturally shed seed of the yogi. This conflict leads to many quarrels between Siva and Par- 146 Siva 2.2.16.41 and44, 2.3.36.12, 2.3.27.32;Skanda 1.1.35.27-34, 1.1.22.67-81, 2.25.59-66. 147 Bhavisya 3.4.14.40-43. 148 Brhaddharma 2.60.7-51; cf.

When she asks him why he has burnt Kama, he answers lamely that it was not he who burnt Kama, but merely his third eye.150 At other times she teases him: "You did tapas for a long time in order to obtain me as your wife; then why did you destroy Kama ? When Kama has been destroyed, what use have you for a wife ? This is an act of a yogi [not of a husband], to destroy Kama. ... If you take no sexual pleasure in me, how have you managed to make love to me ? But sexual pleasure cannot make you happy, for you burnt Kama to ashes."151 She holds his asceticism respon- sible for the antierotic turn of mind that leads him to insult her sexual pride. Her resentment of his tapas is reflected in the belief that South Indian yogis, snake charmers, and scavengers "account for their condition as resulting from a curse that was imposed be- cause of some slighting remarks made regarding Parvati's breasts."152 3. THE RECONCILIATION OF SIVA AND PARVATI The quarrels are an important part of the mythology of Siva and Parvati, in part because they demonstrate the conflict between the aspects of Siva, but also because, in the Hindu view, quarrels, violence, and separation enhance rather than mar a sexual rela- tionship.153 The quarrels of Siva and Parvati bring about a hiatus in their sexual union that makes it possible for them to replenish their powers by means of tapas.???? Then, reconciled, they can apply those powers to the process of procreation. In the cyclic view, therefore, the quarrel is ultimately a sexual stimulus. This is most graphically illustrated by the solution of one argument: "As Siva and Parvati quarreled, the uproar from that quarrel burst through the ground and became a liiga. The gods named it the Liniga of the Lord of Quarrels, and whoever worships it is for- 149 Edward J.

When Siva quarrels with Parvati in his ascetic aspect, he re- unites with her in his erotic aspect.155 But the rapprochement may come about from the opposite direction as well: Siva may remain an ascetic and Parvati may come to accept him in this aspect. Though she often berates him for lacking a house during the rainy season,156 she consents to go with him above the clouds to avoid the rain;157 she comes to accept the clouds and mountains as a more wonderful kind of house than the conventional one. Her attachment to Siva is unconventional, and incomprehensible to her parents,158 but it is not without cause. Just as she desires him because he has destroyed Kama, so she loves him for the very reasons that are cited against him: "Bhola [the fool, a name of Siva] is ever laughing and weeping and knows no one save me. He is always eating hemp, and I must stay near him. I cannot keep from worrying... about this madman."159 The funeral ashes on his chest, the third eye in his forehead, the matted locks through which the river Ganges flows, the snakes which adorn him every- where, the bloody elephant skin wrapped around his chest, or his nakedness-all may transcend their conventional and literal re- pulsiveness and exert a magical erotic power. When Siva, in dis- guise, reviles himself before her to test her,160 he means it ostensibly as a deterrent to her love for him, but there is in all the wine and wildness which he seems to censure the Dionysian quality of life that strengthens her love even as he speaks of horrible things.

Little Kumara plays with the cobra that serves Siva as a necklace, counting his hoods or fangs with childish inaccuracy-"one, three, ten, eight"-so that Siva and Parvatl laugh.167 Kumara romps among all the ascetic accouter- ments: May Guha [Skanda] save you from misfortune, who rolls at will upon his father's chest until his limbs are whitened from the funeral ash; who from the headdress then dives deep into the Ganges at the coldness of whose stream he cries aloud, till trembling and with chattering teeth he holds his hands before the blazing eye.168 In another verse, the horrible ornaments are used as toys or "mis- taken" for toys, in the Sanskrit convention, quite transcending the natural contrast between the hideous and charming aspects of the objects: He touches the garland made of skulls in hope that they are geese 161 Subhdsitaratnakosa No. 75. 162 G.

This tension, expressed by the mythology in terms of marital discord and unnatural children, is ultimately ob- viated by the attitude of Parvati, as it is accepted in the mind of the worshiper, through bhakti, a deep love for the god, transcend- ing all reason. The Puranas abound in explicit statements of Siva's reconciliation of the two roles: "When 8iva became in- carate as the Rudra on Kailasa mountain, he was a yogi, free from any emotions; he then became a householder, marrying the best of women. Though he was an ascetic, he married her, herself an ascetic, at the importunity of Visnu."170 This importunity is described in detail: Krna summoned Siva and said, "Marry the Goddess." Siva smiled and said, "I will not take a wife like any natural man. A woman is an obstacle to knowledge and salvation, an instrument of lust and delusion. I do not want a household wife; I wish to remain free of all enjoyments and sexual pleasures." Krsna said, "You are the greatest of ascetics and yogis; but now you must marry and enjoy erotic pleasures for a thousand years. You must not be merely an ascetic; in time you will be a householder and a man of tapas as you wish. And only an evil woman brings the misery that you see in union with a wife; not a chaste woman. Sati will be your wife, and men will worship your linga placed in the yoni of the Goddess."l71 Krsna here convinces Siva to avoid being "merely" an ascetic or a householder. The argument-that a virtuous wife is a boon and only a wicked woman a burden-is used against 8iva by the Pine Forest sages, who try to convince him that his wife must be aban- doned because she is unchaste, while they wish their own "chaste" wives to remain with them.172 Without any feeling of contradiction, the devotee sees in Siva the realization of all possibilities: he is an ascetic and a house- holder at once; of course he is the eternal brahmacdrin; and he is a forest-dweller in all those myths in which he performs tapas with Parvati. A passage similar to Daksa's diatribe against Siva appears in a hymn in praise of Siva: "You are not a god or a 169 Subhdsitaratnakosa No. 91. 170 giva 2.2.1.3-5. 171 Brahmavaivarta 1.6.1-40. 172 Kurma 2.38.25-32. 34</page><page sequence="35">History of Religions demon, nor a mortal, nor an animal; you are not a Brahmin nor a man nor a woman nor a eunuch."173 Even the accusations of Daksa and the sages are based not on the absence of any particu- lar requirement for any particular stage, but rather on the presence of qualities from another stage which seem to conflict with the stage in question. He does not lack asceticism, but he has weapons as well; he does not lack a wife, but he lives in the burning- grounds (rather than in a house) as well. The stages of life meet in two ways in the mythology of Siva: Parvati herself brings elements of the householder ethic into the world of asceticism when she leaves her father's palace to marry Siva, and he introduces elements of tapas into the tradition of married life by accepting her. This mirrors the symbiotic relation- ship of conventional and ascetic thought in the actual social order. Both Siva and Parvati transgress the normal social order to unite the superficially opposed elements of tapas and kdma that are reconciled in the religious sphere and that, by implication, ought to be combined in ordinary life as well. The opposition on the mortal level is between the two goals: it is best to be a holy man, to give up all sensual pleasures, and it is best to beget sons, to ful- fil one's duties to society. This is of course a problem known to other cultures as well, but in Hinduism it is exaggerated, because nowhere on earth are passionless sages more venerated and no- where are the ties of family and progeny, strengthened by caste strictures and the importance of rituals for the dead, more com- pelling. Man himself must be both procreative and ascetic; so god must be the most ascetic of ascetics, the most erotic of lovers. He resolves the paradox in his own character by embodying a philo- sophy found throughout Hinduism: that chastity and sexuality are not opposed but symbiotic, that the chaste man is procreative by virtue of his chastity, and that the man who lives happily with his wife is performing a sacrament in his very life-if he but realizes it. I. CYCLES OF SEXUALITY AND ASCETICISM IN SIVA The social phases embodied in the four-stage system appear on the cosmic level as a constant, cyclic readjustment in the forces of tapas and kdma, a waning and waxing of powers that can never be 173 iva 2.2.15.61; cf. MHB XIII.17.56; Nilakantha on MHB XIII.17.58 (Bombay). 35</page><page sequence="36">Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva dispersed or destroyed, but only transmuted into one another. This interplay begins with the basic Hindu belief that ascetic power is destroyed by any sexual influence.17411 1[1 11 1 Siva himself is susceptible to this loss of his ascetic powers, and for this reason he destroys Kama. When he enters his procreative phase, he is not immediately reduced in any way, for his ascetic powers are sexual powers. But eventually his powers are drained, and he must pass on to the next phase of the cycle: After marrying Parvati, Siva made love to her for a thousand years, but then he lost all of his tejas and his virility. Seeing himself thus diminished, giva resolved to perform tapas, and he undertook a great vow.... He said to Parvati, "My dear, the vow that I performed before gave me powers which I have now exhausted, for I lost my ascetic merit by making love to you day and night. Now I must again enter the forest and perform tapas."175 Even without the specific tradition of asceticism, Siva must per- form tapas in order to regain his lost powers in his role of vegeta- tion god. As the representative of the powers of nature, he must, like nature itself, replenish from time to time the energies which he has spent.176 Siva exhausts his powers when he succumbs to Kama. He then returns to his tapas, but, as the cycle continues, the tapas that he performs gives him still greater sexual powers than he had before the confrontation, just as Kama himself is eventually magnified by his battle with Siva. 1. TAPAS AS EXPIATION Tapas is able to restore not only sexual power but moral power as well; a part of the traditional expiation for sexual sins is the per- formance of vows of asceticism.177 When Siva wishes to seduce the wife of Bhadrayu and Bhadrayu protests that by so doing he will incur great evil, Siva replies, "I can scatter with my tapas the sin of the slaughter of a Brahmin or the drinking of wine; so what is the seduction of another man's wife to me ? Give me your wife."'78 For this reason, the wanderings of Siva as a Kapalika, particularly 174 Dubois, op. cit., p. 508; Manu 11.121-22; Matsya 3.39-40; 14.1-8.

One text states that Siva must wander as a Kapa- lika with a skull in his right hand to replenish the powers lost by making love to Parvati.18l In the later texts, purification is auto- matic: "One who drinks wine or makes love to the wife of another man or kills a Brahmin or seduces his guru's wife is released from all sins by tapas."l82 This is precisely the boast of Siva to Bhad- rayu. The tapas which thus restores Siva also leads eventually into the next cycle of erotic activity; when Siva has married Parvati he carries her into the bedroom "with powers made great by his meditation,"l83 powers specifically said to be "an abundance of the qualities to achieve sexual intercourse."'84 Siva is said to make love to Parvati particularly well because of his tapas and to be able to continue to do so for hundreds of years.185***** 2. THE DANGEROUS EXTREMES OF CHASTITY AND SEXUALITY As Siva embodies the extremes of each aspect, he explores each one to its fullest, even absurd, extension. Though the net result of the myth is a balance, before that is achieved it may approach dangerous extremes in either or even both of its components. Both Siva's sexuality and his chastity pose certain threats to the bal- ance of the universe: his tapas generates great heat which menaces the world, like the tapas of any ascetic, until an apsaras (Parvati) is sent by Indra to disperse it.186 Moreover, as Siva embodies the 179 G.

This is one of the implications of the Pine Forest myth, in which the universe is shattered when Siva's linga falls. Another danger is that, as long as Siva remains ab- sorbed in meditation, he will be unable to undertake any functions such as creation or the killing of demons.187 For these reasons, the gods object to his chastity and beg him to marry. Yet the great majority of the Hindu myths depict Siva's sexual activity as dangerous and his chaste aspect as a refuge; where sexual activity is motion and fire, chastity is quiescence and cool water. His auspicious form is chaste, while his terrible form de- stroys the universe.188 His excessive sexual behavior weakens him so that he is unable to conquer demons, just as his excessive chastity places him hors de combat; his extreme devotion to his wife makes him a laughingstock.189 But the greatest danger arising from his sexuality is the actual friction or heat generated by the activity itself, like the dangerous tapas of chastity; the effect of the extreme form of either of the opposed aspects is the same. When Siva and Parvati make love, it is like a great, unwanted doomsday about to destroy the universe,190 shaking the earth and the universe.191 The love making of Siva and Parvati can also be dangerous for the opposite reason, like their chastity-not because it generates too much activity, but because it causes them to with- draw from all other activity, so that the universe is in danger of running down.192 While locked in Parvati's embrace, Siva per- forms no sacrifice or tapas,193 does nothing at all,194 and deprives the gods of the sight of his person.195 Even when the gods succeed in interrupting this dangerous act, they are left with the still more serious problem of the offspring of Parvati and Siva, destined to be too powerful for the world to bear.196 For this reason, Siva's seed must be taken from him and used to generate a son else- 187 Vdmana 21.10-18; Kdlikd 4.7, 9.30, 5.68, Jiva 2.2.11.21-27, 2.2.16.8-19; V.

Thus giva's tapas or his kdma may prevent the birth of a needed son or threaten to produce a dangerous son. The forces of Siva's chastity and sexuality can never be de- stroyed or turned back to their sources; the fire is never quenched, but its destructive power may be channeled into the next creative phase. Chastity develops into desire, and the fulfilment of desire leads to chastity. In Hindu terms, chastity builds up powers of tapas which are dissipated by sexual activity and then must be restored. When Siva's chastity becomes extreme, he must be se- duced by Parvati and Kama, only to become excessively sexual and forced by the gods and Agni to become chaste again. Siva himself varies his attributes in opposition to the qualities of other gods and sages, as if to set up a thermostatic control on their ex- cesses, just as they do on his. Tapas and kdma, interchangeable forms of cosmic heat, replace and limit one another to maintain the balance of the universe. 3. PRAVRTTI AND NIVRTTI In some myths, pravrtti (activity, worldly involvement) is con- trasted with nivrtti (quiescence, withdrawal), the former identified with sexual activity and the latter with asceticism. When Siva ceases to create and becomes a pillar of chastity, he is said to have nivrtti as his essence.97 As an ascetic, he dwells in nivrtti and shuns a wife, pravrtti. His mind is quiescent (nivrttam) when, after making love for many years, he is satisfied.198 But, as both tapas and kdma are forces of energy, pravrtti, to- gether they may be contrasted with their true opposite: quies- cence, nivrtti. Although quiescence is what Siva usually teaches, for it is the favorite path of the ascetic schools which he represents, pravrtti is what he himself usually embodies, pure life energy. Thus, though he is said to go to the Pine Forest to teach the sages to leave pravrtti and devote themselves to nivrtti,199 he does this by dancing in wild, naked abandon with their wives. Although he refuses to marry, saying that he delights only in tapas and nivrtti, with no use for pravrtti and the ways of mistresses,200 he does 197 Kuirma 1.10.39. 198 Siva 2.2.16.31 and 35, 2.2.23.7. 199 Linga 1.29.1-83, 1.31.21-45; Kurma 2.38.2-6 and 129-31; cf.

The cycles of his sexuality may to a certain extent be read in terms of Tantric philosophy. During the Tantric rite, the devotee exhausts the forces of pravrtti, the outgoing path, and begins to cultivate nivrtti.202ttttt Siva too must use both paths, must fol- low the outgoing path to prevent the accumulation of too great a power and then replenish that power by the path of nivrtti. At Siva's request, Brahma substitutes for universal death the process of periodical action and quiescence.203 Siva himself is said to be the source of both pravrtti and nivrtti,204 the force of life and per- fect peace. Yet quiescence in Siva is not a negative force, an absence of power; it is the ultimate solution to the problem of cycles. For Siva, unlike the mortal yogi, need not alternate phases of sexual activity and yogic restoration, but may exist in both states simultaneously. This is the meaning of the ithyphallic yogi: "In many of his icons, he [Siva] is ithyphallic; often he appears with his consort. At the same time he is the patron deity of yogis, identi- fied as such by his piled-up mass of uncut and uncombed hair, and by his nudity. This is not inconsistent with his sexual vitality. For the source of the yogi's power is his own divine sexuality, con- served and concentrated by asceticism."205 The ambiguous figure of the erotic ascetic is the only possible continuous manifestation of Siva which can hold in suspension the two extremes of chastity and sexuality. The moment at which the two phases cancel each other out is the moment of nivrtti in its broadest sense, the hiatus between the episodes of pravrtti-chaste or sexual-an apparent calm which is in fact a perfectly balanced tension. In many myths Siva is merely an erotic or merely ascetic, as a momentary view of one phase or another.
