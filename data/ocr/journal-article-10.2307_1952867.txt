<plain_text><page sequence="1">POWER AND VIOLENCE* E. V. WALTER Brandeis University The ancient Greeks rarely fail us when we turn to them in a receptive but cautious spirit for conceptual clarity, and their treatment of the abstraction "power" and terms related to it is relevant and suggestive. In Greek, a root contained in several words associated with political power has two meanings. The verb archein means both "to rule" and "to start"; the noun archer means both "sovereignty" and "beginning." J. L. Myres, in his analysis of Greek political ideas, suggests: It is now clear that in compounds the prefix arkhU (as in our words "architect" and "arch- bishop") describes not merely the first or chief man of a company or organization, but the initia- tory function of him who "starts" the others to work, and originates the design which they are to complete. And this appeal to Greek practical life confirms the view that what is essential in the notion of arkhU is just this initiatory "push" or "drive" with which the gifted man imposes his will-and-pleasure on the rest.' If we follow Myres, we may infer that in the place where Herodotus reports the wealthy noble, Otanes, to have said he had no wish "archein kai archesthai"; as well as where Aristotle writes that the good citizen must have the knowledge and the ability "archesthai kai archein" the words mean "to start and be started" as well as "to rule and be ruled."2 When Aristotle defines terms in The Meta- physics, one of the six meanings of "beginning," following the Ross translation, is the group or individual "at whose will that which is moved is moved and that which changes changes, e.g. the magistracies in cities, and oligarchies and monarchies and tyrannies, are called archai . . ."I "To have power" covers a broader range of activity than "to govern, or "to rule," but the * This essay is based on materials for a book, Terror and Society, to be published by Oxford Uni- versity Press.

Defining dynamics, Aristotle says, "the beginning of a change or movement is called a power . . ."4 In social interactions, we may say that if the source of an action performed by an individual is to be found in a prior act of another individual, then the latter has power over the former with re- spect to that act. By "source" we also mean "cause" in the sense that it must be the suffi- cient condition for the action; if the prior act did not occur, then the subsequent action would not take place. When action is "caused" in this way, then we can speak of one individual or group "controlling" the action of another. As I shall explain, however, there is more to power than "control," for power processes frequently deal with actions that are out of control. If an individual or group we shall name "P" intends to cause a respondent designated "R" to per- form an action "X", and R does not perform X, then if P proceeds to change R in some way- for example, to penalize or to "reform" R-be- cause of the failure to perform X, this pro- cedure is a form of power, since with respect to X, P is the source of changes in R.5 Aristotle states, moreover, that the tend- ency to resist change is also a kind of power,6 and the observation that resistance, or the ability to withstand attempts at control, is a form of counterpower, is a central idea in the present investigation.

The Hope translation prefers "power" to the word "potency," which is found in older translations. 6 As indicated below, I have extended the con- ception of power proposed by Felix E. Oppenheim in Dimensions of Freedom: An Analysis (New York, St. Martin's Press, 1961). His scheme is more useful than those proposed by Lasswell and other contemporary analysts of power. As David Braybrooke has stated in a recent review, Oppen- heim has probably "come closer than any previ- ous writer to achieving maximum clarity about freedom and such related concepts as power and control." I agree with Braybrooke that "the next order of business" in the analysis of power and freedom is the critique of this scheme, "for as of this moment that subject starts with Oppenheim's account."

To avoid confusion, power should be distinguished from other social transactions similar to it, especially the process that is usually called "social con- trol" in the more narrow sense. (I am excluding altogether the very general sense in which social control means regulated behavior of any kind.) In the course of socialization, the in- clinations and dispositions of individuals are shaped in ways that cause them to want to do the things that are expected of them-that is, to act in an institutionalized manner. This social conditioning yields acts which stem from the individual's own initiative. In cases of deviant behavior, excluding illegal acts, the right to levy social sanctions such as criticism or ridicule is usually exercised by an indeter- minate number of persons within a given range of social relationship. What differentiates this kind of social control from power is that first, conventional behavior comes from the indi- vidual's own initiative, and second, deviant behavior is not punished by specified persons charged with the task of enforcing the socially prescribed conduct. In contrast, a case of con- formist behavior caused by the demand for a conventional act by a specific person, is indeed an instance of power. So also is a case of legal punishment carried out by a specific staff. This is not to deny that social control and socialization are related to power as auxiliary forces. Individuals are conditioned to obedience in most societies, with lesser or greater degrees of rigor, so that in ordinary circumstances when acts of power do come their way, men are disposed to obey them. If these acts come under the aegis of legitimate authority, obedience is usually voluntary and resistance minimal. As MacIver puts it, "Men obey because they are social beings-or, if you prefer it, because they are socialized beings."7 The concept of power is often confined to acts of control. or to "the production of intended effects," as Bertrand Russell defines it.8 These notions are too limited. When controls are exercised and penalties imposed by individuals who did not think of doing so in the first place, or by those who did not foresee the conse- quences of their actions, they are unintended acts of power. Moreover, Felix Oppenheim has shown that "control" is a domain too narrow to 7 R. M. MacIver, The Web of Government (New York, 1947), p. 77. 8 Bertrand Russell, Power: A New Social Analysis (London, Unwin Books, 1962), p. 25. be identified with power, and he extends the latter to mean the ability to influence, to re- strain, or to punish. To have power, in this sense, means "to be able to subject others to one's control or to limit their freedom."9 Oppenheim's taxonomy of power relations is based on the microanalysis of particular trans- actions, but it may still be used to identify events and processes after we move from the interpersonal to the macrosocial level of ob- servation, although it has certain limitations on that level. Control of an individual's act, Oppenheim demonstrates, is exercised in two ways: through determining his choice or through managing his body or environment in such a way that he has no choice. The former way is called "influ- ence," and its several methods include "per- suasion," which means convincing him in some manner that it is to his advantage to perform (or withhold) the act in question, and "de- terrence," which means making him withhold (or perform) the act out of apprehension for the consequences if he were to refuse.10 All cases of control-with the consent of the one who is controlled as well as against his will-imply a causal relation, meaning that the act of the controller is the sufficient condition for the response of the individual controlled. "When- ever one actor exercises control over another, he causes him to behave in a certain way.""11 In addition to "exercising control," Oppen- heim introduces the category of "having con- trol," a form of potential action which includes "having influence" and "preventing." The former means that a controller stands in such a relation to an individual that if the latter were to intend performing a given act, then the controller would dissuade, deter, or otherwise influence him not to perform it. "Preventing" means not actually causing an individual to withhold a specific act, but closing the alterna- tive in advance, making it impossible-whether he decided to act or not-for him to perform the act. Oppenheim explains: Prevention is usually not mentioned among the various forms of control and power; yet, making it impossible for others to act in a certain way constitutes the most effective device of gaining control over their actual behavior. Would-be controllers usually want to establish control over their respondents in such a way that the latter make no attempt at evading it.12 Making something impossible, he observes, 9 Dimensions of Freedom, p. 100. 10 Ibid., ch. 2. "1 Ibid., p. 40. 12 Ibid., p. 52.</page><page sequence="3">352 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW frequently means constructing some physical or psychological obstacle that constitutes a sufficient condition for a state of affairs to be not realized. If a person is ordered to perform a specific act and refuses, his behavior is not controlled with respect to that act. Yet, if the commander of the act punishes the person for not perform- ing it, he still has power over the person, ac- cording to Oppenheim's scheme, with respect to that act. One has power over another with respect to a particular act if he can control (cause) the act or make it punishable to per- form or to withhold it.13 Penalizing is the major form of imposing punishment, and penalties- involving pain, privation, or some other kind of unpleasantness-are experiences which are dis- liked and avoided because they are considered harmful, or for some other obvious reason. I would go beyond Oppenheim's scheme to in- clude along with penalties, procedures of "re- form,". "treatment," and "rehabilitation." These, too, may be imposed by persons in power as responses to acts they are unable to control. In some cases, these practices are dis- guised forms of penalty. In others, they may help an individual rather than harm him-add something valuable to his life rather than take something away. Yet, regardless of whether the experience given is baneful or beneficial, it constitutes a form of power if it changes the individual whose conduct was out of control. A power relation, moreover, is a dynamic interaction in which at least some control may be exercised by all parties. It is clear, of course, that each does not control the others to the same degree, nor do they control the same thing. Oppenheim's static taxonomy, valuable as it is for some purposes of descriptive nomen- clature, cannot deal adequately with features such as reciprocity and tension.' Indeed we should not expect its conceptual frame, limited to reporting power relations as individual acts of control or punishment, to capture the dy- namic aspects of interaction. Thus, the report: "Y has power over X with respect to x, but X has power over Y with respect to y" could not inform us how behavior x is related to behavior y, nor could it tell us anything about the nature of the relation between person X and person Y. Power relations are built of repetitive, durable patterns of action, but microsociological taxo- nomic schemes, when stretched beyond their useful limits, tend to dissolve relation into indi- vidual acts. One needs to introduce a set of dynamic concepts-such as the idea of stress, developed in physics as well as in medical 13 Ibid., chs. 4, 5. 14 Ibid., chs. 1-6. pathology-to understand durable interactions, such as the relation between force and resis- tance.'" To have a conception broad enough to cover all types, elementary and complex, I would define a power system as a pattern of actions, initiated by specific persons, which controls a range of behavior in a specific group and deals with instances of behavior, within a given range, out of their control. This generic definition is formal and does not specify methods or the way in which power is experi- enced. In elementary systems of power with a solitary head, the leader, chief, or king gen- erally performs a configuration of functions that involves both controlling and punishing: initiating collective action, legitimating, co- ordinating particular acts, integrating the group, adjudicating disputes, and dealing with disruptive behavior. Some characteristics of control and integration in an elementary sys- tem of power are revealed in William F. Whyte's classic study of the Cornerville gang: The leader is the focal point for the organization of his group. In his absence, the members of the gang are divided into a number of small groups. There is no common activity or general conversa- tion. When the leader appears, the situation changes strikingly. The small units form into one large group. The conversation becomes general, and unified action frequently follows. The leader becomes the central point in the discussion. A follower starts to say something, pauses when he notices that the leader is not listening, and begins again when he has the leader's attention. When the leader leaves the group, unity gives way to the divisions that existed before his appearance.' The leader provides coordination and initia- tive, but reciprocal obligations and the ex- change of services, Whyte shows also, bind the group, and built into the leader's role is the expectation that he will be generous. George Homans has noted in Tacitus's de- scription of the German tribes how the relation between the king and his companions resembles the relation between the informal leader and the small group.' If we turn to Tacitus, we find also that the king's power is limited, and "the generals do more by example than by author- 16 Cf.

In assembly, the king or chief is heard "more because he has influence to persuade than because he has power to command." The leaders with the largest following are those whose exploits promise the largest advan- tages.'8 Similarly, in many African traditional systems, it is the practice for large followings to adhere to popular chiefs who rule well and for poor rulers to lose their people. Even among the Southern Bantu, where loyalty and pa- tience have been cardinal virtues, Eric Walker indicates that if a chief "ate up his men" by confiscating their property and otherwise met- ing excessive punishments, he might wake up to find his people gone over to a more moderate rival.'9 Whereas the traditional chief typically holds power in relatively peaceful conditions, the king is a figure more often found in conditions of repetitive, organized warfare. Weber sug- gests, "The king is everywhere primarily a war lord, and kingship evolves from charismatic heroism."20 The Israelites, one will recall, according to the King James version, wanted a king to "judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles." The king typically combines in his person several functions: military, judic- ial, religious, and civil executive. Since they have little division of function and not much constitutional machinery, primitive monarchies resemble one another, despite cultural differ- ences, in a striking way.2' Kingship of the simple kind requires ritual control over the royal ancestors and other spirits-making possible the control of nature by magic; military might-involving a staff of armed dependents; judicial skill; and the tech- niques of civil administration. Some ruling houses tended to develop this configuration of abilities as a specialty which they would bring to any people they could rule by force or by invitation. During the heroic age of Greece, there is evidence, that some Achaean princely families moved about, thrust out of one area, winning a throne in another, fleeing vengeance from one people to establish a dynasty in the midst of another. Exercising power through a typical, elementary configuration of control and punishment techniques, and by the force of their personalities, kings managed to hold to- 18 Tacitus, The Complete Works (New York, Modern Library, 1942), pp. 712, 714. 19 Eric A.

A. WV. Southall in his remarkable study of some traditional political systems in Western Uganda, describes how power-especially rainmaking and judicial skill-is a quality exclusively possessed by the lineage of Alur chiefs. Members of the chiefly family would be invited, bought, or even stolen by neighboring people who yearned for welfare and order, but knew of no other method to establish a political head.23 Power may be experienced as inspiring, wholesome, tolerable, or oppressive, depending on the circumstances. It may release creative energy, heightening vitality,24 it may destroy motivation, generating a pall of depression, or it may stimulate conflict and rebellion. It may induce a sense of freedom or a sense of tyranny, but deeper than those alternatives, Ortega has shown, sometimes the state may be shaped after the community's vital preferences and life within it felt as exhilarating freedom, whereas at other times the whole weight of regulative institutions is oppressive and life is converted into "spiritless adaptation of each individual existence to the iron mold of the state."26 From an historical point of view, the way in which power is experienced is a critical matter, for it determines the motivations of people to keep or to change the system in which they live. When people do something according to their own will, we ordinarily say they are acting voluntarily. When they act against their will, desire, inclination, or intention, we say they are being forced to do something. This is the sense in which the word "force" will be used here-a general term to include any agency that com- pels someone to do something that he does not want to do. The term "coercion" will be limited to mean any social form of compulsion-usu- 22 Cambridge Ancient History, II, 1st ed., ch. xvii; N. G. L. Hammond, A History of Greece to 322 B.C.

The term "violence" will be restricted to the sense of destructive harm; hence, a destructive kind of force. As a general term, it would include not only physical assaults that cause damage to the person, but also magic, sorcery, and the many techniques of inflicting harm by mental or emotional means. It includes psychic and spiritual harm as well as physical damage, and one may turn to anthropological literature for accounts of magical and spiritual terrorism practiced by shamans, magicians, and priests.26 Historically, however, physical violence is more ponderable, extensive, and is the type that is organized on the widest scale. Forms of "influence" such as "persuasion" are, then, not instances of force, for by them the controller changes intentions, causing people to choose to perform acts initiated by him. Deterrence, prevention, restraint, and punishment, when they work against the will of the respondent are, of course, instances of force. If people are forced in ways that are destructive and injurious, they are being treated with violence. Although the term may also be applied to property, I shall restrict its meaning to events that cause undesirable changes in the condition of the person, includ- ing processes that threaten his life or substanti- ally diminish his physical or psychic wellbeing and safety. Violence is generally understood as unmeas- ured or exaggerated harm to individuals, either not socially prescribed at all or else beyond the limits established for its use.27 Thus, it is often socially defined to include processes that may originate as authorized, measured force, but which go beyond the prescribed conditions and limits. For example, in systems such as ours, a police officer may be authorized to exercise physical restraint in making an arrest, but he will be said to act in a violent manner if, with- out acceptable reasons, he attacks and injures a fugitive. In some cases, however, police brutality may be officially condemned as vio- lence, yet socially expected and used unoffici- ally as means of control. When a violent process is socially prescribed and defined as a legitimate means of control or 26 Cf. Paul Radin, The World of Primitive Man (New York, 1960), chs. 6, 8. 27 David Cooperman takes a different approach in Power, Force, and Violence (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Minnesota, 1954). Working out the problem in a conceptual frame- work that follows Talcott Parsons, he deals with effects on the normative structure and defines violence as destructive harm not to persons, as I have defined it, but to boundaries of action. punishment, according to the practices familiar to us, the destructive harm is measured and the limits made clear. Social definition as an authorized method often extracts it from the category of violence-at least from the stand- point of the society-and places it in the same domain with other socially approved coercive techniques. In this study, however, any kind of destructive harm to the person will be taken as violence-but specified as legitimate or ille- gitimate in its social definition. Aristotle does not distinguish between force and violence, but uses the term bia, which, like the German word Gewalt, may mean both. In his works, bia is used in a very general way, standing for the physical concept referring to inanimate nature as well as for "compulsion" in human behavior. As he defines it in the fifth book of The Metaphysics, bia is a kind of neces- sity which hinders and impedes the course of impulse and purpose.28 The notion of force "as an agent of compulsory motion," Max Jammer shows, is the core of Aristotle's system of me- chanics.29 To force something means to make a thing move against its own "natural internal tendency," and the same conception appears in his ethical theory as well as in his theory of physics. In human conduct, bia refers to cases where the cause of action lies in things outside the actor, and when the actor contributes nothing.30 Jammer explains that in physics, the notion of force evolved through the Peripatetic and Scholastic stage, where it was encumbered by animistic formulations. In this stage, the notion of force was rooted in the everyday ex- perience of push and pull, but it is easy to see how close it was as well to the sociological notions of conflict and power.3" Paul Tillich, too, has indicated that the notions of power and force when expressed in words by physicists are anthropomorphic metaphors. "Power is a sociological category and from there it is trans- ferred to nature ..." he observes." Indeed, when the concept of force in physics is liberated from confusion with the sociological notion, it tends to disappear, and although modern me- chanics still tolerates it as a "methodological intermediate," Jammer argues, "the theory of fields would have to banish it even from this humble position.""3 28 Metaph. 1015a, b. 29 Max Jammer, Concepts of Force: A Study in the Foundations of Dynamics (New York, 1962), p. 37. 30 Nichomachean Ethics 111Ob. 31 Jammer, op. cit., p.

It signifies "strength" or "might," and just as archer is found in terms such as "monarchy" and "oligarchy," kratos appears in the suffix of such terms as "aristocracy," "democracy," and "plutocracy"-which mean systems in which the best-born, the people, and wealth, respectively, are the strongest element. In other contexts, however, where archer suggests initia- tive and the voluntary side of obedience, kratos indicates force and the involuntary side.34 The poetic tradition, differing from Aristotle in this respect, offers a provocative distinction between force and violence. As mythological personifications, Kratos (Might) and Bia (Violence) are individuated spirits, but they are both forms of force, and they appear together on the same team, servants of divine power. In Hesiod's genealogy of the gods, Kratos and Bia are the "wonderful children" of Pallas-whose name perhaps means the "brandisher" or "shaker" thereby representing threat-and Styx, who represents horror. Kratos and Bia dwell only in the house of Zeus and go where he directs them.35 In Prometheus Bound, they are the first to appear on stage, dragging Pro- metheus to his rock. In this play, Aeschylus conveys that Zeus is ruling as a tyrant who has seized power, having overthrown the old order of gods and having displaced the previous king, Kronos. Whenever rule is new it is harsh, we are told. A tyrant's orders are his own private business, and the new steersman on Olympus controls by rules which have no law in them.36 Kratos (Might) is the first to speak in the play; he discusses the fate of Prometheus and later rebukes him for rebellion. Bia (Violence) is silent throughout the play.37 The words of Kratos are consistently tough and bitter, and he is told that he is always ruthless and without pity.38 Even though both are instruments of force in the service of tyrannical power, the difference between the roles of Might and Violence is instructive. Might uses words and directs itself to reasoning processes. Violence remains mute. It suggests that force in the 34 In Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 373, Ismene tells exiled Oedipus that at Thebes, each of his sons is attempting to grasp both arch6 and kratos of the throne. 36 Hesiod, Theogony 385. 36 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound 34, 402, 150. 37 The fact that the official rules limited speech to only two persons on stage, it should go without saying, is hardly a complete or sufficient ex- planation for Bia's silence. 38 Aesch. Pr. 42. sense of Might is similar in some way to leader- ship, since it employs persuasion. But persua- sion for what? If leadership induces voluntary action, how can Might exhort involuntary action? If the content of Kratos' speeches is examined, an answer emerges: the persuasive mission of Might is to manage the impression of irresistibility and to diminish resistance. No one can escape obedience and service; only Zeus is free. Resistance is foolish and dangerous. The message of Kratos is that one should learn endurance and resignation in the face of supe- rior strength.39 Violence, the other instrument of tyrannical power, acts, but has nothing to say. Although men universally agree that vio- lence and other kinds of force are perennially associated with the exercise of power, there is anything but agreement over the question of the proper-in both a technical and a moral sense-relation between such methods and the power system. Among the several ideas of political power in the vast literature on the subject, two prominent conceptions appear, superficially at least, to contradict each other. One, considering violence as the failure of power, would exclude it from the definition; the other, considering violence as the specific property of political associations, makes it central to the definition of political power. When the concepts, "power" and "political" are disentangled and examined separately, the points of view may be discerned with greater clarity. One position considers "authority" as the authentic form of power, based on consent, voluntary obedience, and persuasion, and con- siders violence as a symptom attending the breakdown of authority. The nuclear ideas in this venerable notion may be found far back in the Western tradition-in Homer's and Hesiod's beliefs about the antagonism between violence and right, in the Socratic opposition to Thrasymachus, and in Plato's conviction that persuasion is morally superior to force, to mention only a few sources. The notion is held by many writers in the modern period-by Rousseau in The Social Contract, for instance- and expressed in the recent literature of social science by writers such as Charles Merriam and R. M. MacIver. Merriam protests that many observers "make the same fundamental error in analysis of the power situation in society, of overstating the role of violence." He argues: In most communities the use of force is relatively uncommon in proportion to the number of regula- tions, and the success of the organization is not 39 Ibid., 50, 10.</page><page sequence="7">356 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW measured by the amount of violence in specific cases, but by the extent to which violence is avoided and other substitutes discovered. The monopoly of force, which is so often declared to be the chief characteristic of the political associa- tion, is not meant for daily use, but as a last resort when all other measures of persuasion and con- ciliation have failed.40 Similarly, MacIver declares: Without authority force is destructive violence, spasmodic, undirected, futile. Authority is re- sponsive to the underlying social structure. The force of government is but an instrument of authority, vindicating the demands of an order that force alone never creates.4' Though writers who hold this point of view recognize that violence may be used as an in- strument of force by men in authority, they think of it as a last resort and tend to diminish its significance in the organization of controls. They are inclined to deny not only its moral value but also its effectiveness as an instru- ment. The contrary idea was expressed recently by C. Wright Mills, who states succinctly, "All politics is a struggle for power; the ultimate kind of power is violence.'"42 Although Mills and others who view power in this fashion may deplore the bitter reality they perceive, a number of writers holding similar points of view have drawn more positive conclusions. The tradition that includes many of the Sophists, Machiavelli, and Hobbes is a familiar one, and writers within it may not only de- scribe the instrumental worth of violence but also defend its moral value, arguing that it contributes to the termination of discord, the maintenance of order, or the safety of the ruler. The "Mirror of Princes" genre, which is to be found in many civilizations, frequently com- bines advice in the form of rules for cultivating personal virtue with a manual of refined violent techniques.43 In the literature of India, the combination is seen in the classic Kautilya Arthasastra, probably written at the end of the fourth century B.C. shortly after the death of Alexander, composed, according to the tradi- tion, by the Brahman who engineered the downfall of the low-caste Nanda dynasty, placed the great Maurya Chandragupta on the 40 Political Power (Glencoe, Ill., 1950), p. 21. 41 The Web of Government, p. 16. 42 C.

In this book, an introductory section on the personal conduct of the saintly king is followed by an elaborate handbook of systematic deception, violence, and internal espionage.44 Max Weber observed, "In contrast with this document Machiavelli's Principe is harmless."45 It is useful to select this kind of writing in the Indian tradition to illustrate the point of view under discussion because the contrary Indian strain with its idealism and nonviolence is more familiar. In India's Code of Manu, which tradition places at the dawn of civilization,46 violence is described as an instrument of punishment, which in turn is declared to be the most im- portant technique of power. The chapter on kingship goes so far as to state that "Punish- ment is (in reality) the king ... 4 Fear of punishment maintains social order and holds all beings, including the gods, to their duties. Above all, social order depends on the integrity of the caste system, and, indeed, "The king has been created (to be) the protector of the castes (varna) and orders, who, all according to their rank, discharge their several duties."48 The picture Manu paints of what the world would be like if the ranking system were violated re- minds one of the speech Shakespeare gives to Ulysses in Act 1, Scene iii of Troilus and Cressida: 0, when degree is shaked, Which is the ladder to all high designs, The enterprise is sick!

All castes (varna) would be corrupted (by inter- mixture), all barriers would be broken through, and all men would rage (against each other) in consequence of mistakes with respect to punish- ment. But where Punishment with a black hue and red eyes stalks about, destroying sinners, there the subjects are not disturbed, provided that he who inflicts it discerns well.49 Hence the most important function of the king is to measure and administer correct penalties in the form of violence and deprivations.50 Recognizing that violence inspires fear, Manu recommends that the king punish severely those offenders who have committed violent acts. A king must not "let go perpetra- tors of violence, who cause terror to all crea- tures," and a king who desires glory shall not, even for a moment, neglect (to punish) the man who commits violence. He who commits violence must be considered as the worst offender, (more wicked) than a defamer, than a thief, and than he who injures (another) with a staff. Official violence, however, is indispensable, and in the scale of punishments, the degree of violence administered is proportional to the gravity of the offence. Since the purpose of punishment is to maintain the social system with its castes intact, the most violent punish- ments-penalties in terrorem-are to be meted for actions which most seriously threaten the system. For example: Men who commit adultery with the wives of others, the king shall cause to be marked by punishments which cause terror, and afterwards banish. For by (adultery) is caused a mixture of the castes (varna) among men; thence (follows) sin, which cuts up even the roots and causes the destruction of everything.5' It is clear, then, that according to the ancient text of Manu, the effective and proper use of 49 Ibid., p. 219-20. 60 Ibid., p. 218-19. 51 Ibid., p. 314-15. violence as an instrument of punishment is essential to the exercise of power. The contrast between the two ideas of vio- lence in the system of power may be further illuminated by turning to the social thought of another political culture; namely, the literature of China during the latter half of the third century B.C., in which orthodox Confucianism is pitted against the so-called "Legalist" re- vision of that doctrine. Describing the con- frontation, which takes place during the Ch'in empire and continues in the revolutionary period which follows, H. G. Creel observes, "Seldom have two political principles been so clearly opposed and so plainly tested...."52 The Confucian principle maintains that govern- ment must be judged by the degree to which it satisfies the people, considers the state as a cooperative venture, and declares that the proper technique of rule is education and persuasion. The opposite doctrine maintains that it is foolish for the ruler to seek the good will of the people, and that their "wisdom" is useless, for "they are like babies." The Legal- ists hold that the only way to govern is through force and fear, and in the book named after one of their leading theorists, the Han Fei Tzu: They set forth, with ruthless clarity and astrin- gent logic, a system of totalitarian depotism. Han Fei Tzui recognizes the supremacy of nothing but force, and aims at making the ruler rich and powerful. The people are to be used completely as instruments of the ruler's designs, living or dying as suits his purpose.... The ruler need only keep [his ministers] and all of his subjects in such a state of fear that they will dare to do no wrong.63 Moreover, they offer a highly refined, repressive system of shu, or "methods," and insist that to rule properly, the sovereign must "monopolize the handles which control life and death."54 After the Han Fei Tzu, Creel remarks, "the policies of Machiavelli's Prince seem timid and vacillating." The administration of proper punishment is as crucial a matter to Han Fei-tzu as it is to 62 H. G. Creel, Confucius and the Chinese Way (New York, 1960), p. 222.

The ideal ruler of Han Fei-tzu, on the other hand, is content, the historian Fung Yu-lan indicates, with nothing less than celestial omnipotence. The "methods" guaran- tee strict enforcement, "and nothing that he encounters resists him."56 The extreme attitudes concerning the proper place of violence in the power system-one minimizing, the other maximizing its impor- tance-may be understood, as usual, as oppo- site poles of a continuum, with several alterna- tive positions between them. Among the an- cient Greeks, for example, Solon of Athens apparently believes that good order is based on the concord of classes and that the state is a cooperative venture, but, disagreeing with Hesiod, he does not think that violence and right are irreconcilable opposites. Instead, he thinks they are coordinate elements in the power system, working together in the cause of good order, and that violent force is sometimes necessary, because it separates warring factions and prevents them from destroying one another and the state.57 The extreme positions are based on presup- positions which may be expressed as two differ- ent social models. The viewpoint that min- imizes violence reasons from a model of co- operation,58 and seeing violence as an indica- tion that cooperative activity has broken down, infers that violence signifies the breakdown of power as well. The other viewpoint begins with a model of social conflict and reasons that in many cases if conflict were absent, then power would be unnecessary. Violence from this perspective may be seen as a decisive form of power responding to conflict. This point of view is classically expressed by Max Weber, who stipulates: "A social relation- ship will be referred to as 'conflict' in so far as action within it is oriented intentionally to carrying out the actor's own will against the resistance of the other party or parties."59 Weber 55Fung Yu-lan, op. cit., pp. 160, 164. 66 Ibid., p. 158, italics added. 67 T. A. Sinclair, A History of Greek Political Thought (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961), p. 24. 68 The dependence of power on cooperation is cogently argued in E. E. Harris, "Political Power," Ethics, Vol. 68 (1957), pp. 1-10. 59 Max Weber, The Theory of Social and Eco- nomic Organization, trans. A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons (New York, 1947), p. 132; italics added. then defines power as "the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resist- ance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests."60 Thus, it is clear that ac- cording to Weber, two kinds of power are pos- sible: one kind in conditions where conflict and resistance are absent; the other, a conflict in which one party successfully overcomes resis- tance. Since Weber is careful to distinguish power from other forms of social control in which cooperation is more crucial, his approach at least suggests that in the exercise of power, resistance and conflict in one degree or another are highly probable, and perhaps even ex- pected. This idea of power, therefore, tends to imply a process of overpowering. Reinhard Bendix has perceptively observed "that Weber's definition of power is very similar to Clausewitz's definition of war."" The contrary points of view reflected in the concept of power are similarly manifested in concepts of political association including, of course, the definition of the state, one view emphasizing cooperation, authority, and peace- ful methods of control; the other, conflict, coer- cion, and violence. Among the social scientists who hold the latter viewpoint, the anthropolo- gist, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, reasons that coer- cive processes lie at the heart of political or- ganization, and he states in his Preface to African Political Systems: In studying political organization, we have to deal with the maintenance or establishment of social order, within a territorial framework, by the organized exercise of coercive authority through the use, or the possibility of use, of phys- ical force. In well-organized states, the police and the army are the instruments by which coercion is exercised. Within the state, the social order, whatever it may be, is maintained by the punish- ment of those who offend against the laws and by the armed suppression of revolt. Externally the state stands ready to use armed force against other states, either to maintain the existing order or to create a new one. ... The political organization of a society is that aspect of the total organization which is concerned with the control and regulation of the use of. physical force.62 60 Ibid., p. 152, italics added. 61 Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait (New York, 1962), p. 290. 62 African Political Systems, ed.

Thus, David Easton, a political scientist who views the polit- ical structure as a distributive system, authori- tatively allocating values for the entire society, protests that Radcliffe-Brown "over-empha- sizes the role of coercive sanctions, especially force." He argues: In selecting the organized use of force as the gross distinguishing quality of political systems, neither Radcliffe-Brown nor those who share his point of view can be considered adventurous pioneers. Rather they have been following a course laid down by Thomas Hobbes, well marked out by later utilitarianism, reinforced by Max Weber, and validated by many generations of professional students of politics. It is an ap- proach that research in American political science has all but abandoned, although it still has enough vitality to raise its head from time to time.63 Easton agrees that at one time or another all kinds of different organized groups "have used both violent and non-violent means of per- suasion with varying degrees of legitimacy attached to this use," but whereas Weber claims that when they do employ violence, the use of this method gives such groups a "politi- cal" character, Easton comes to the opposite conclusion that "governmental institutions can no longer be differentiated from others merely by virtue of the sanctions that they are able to impose."64 Max Weber is often held responsible for the line of thought that identifies political action with violent techniques, and although he is hardly the originator of the idea, as Easton points out, his work nevertheless provides a classic modern statement of it. In the encyclo- pedic Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, he ascribes to the state certain formal characteristics; namely compulsory membership, territorial jurisdic- tion, continuous organization, and coercive enforcement, but he clearly singles out the use of violence as a specific characteristic giving an organization political identity. In the text of a celebrated address given in Munich in the revolutionary year, 1918, he makes his ideas on this subject clear. In that address, he observes that since there 63 David Easton, "Political Anthropology," Biennial Review of Anthropology 1959, ed. Bernard J. Siegel (Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1959), pp. 213, 218-19. 64 David Easton, The Political System (Now York, 1953), p. 153, n. 2. is no task that some political association has not taken up, and since there are no special ends that are exclusively political, the state and its historical antecedents can be defined in sociological terms: only by a specific means peculiar to it as to every political association: that of physical violence. "Every state is founded on force (Gewalt)," de- clared Trotsky duly at Brest-Litovsk. That is in point of fact correct. If there existed only social structures for which violence were unknown as a means, then would the concept, "state" be abolished, and then would emerge what is de- fined as "anarchy" in this special sense of the word. Violence is naturally not the normal or only means of the state-that goes without saying- but indeed a means specific to it. Today the rela- tion between the state and violence is especially intimate. In the past, all kinds of different associa- tions-beginning with the sib-have known phys- ical violence as an altogether normal means. On the contrary, today we have to say that a state is that human community which, within a given territory-"territory" is one of its characteristics -claims for itself (successfully) the legitimate monopoly of physical violence. Specifically, at present the right of physical violence is assigned to all other associations or individuals only to the extent permitted by the state; it is supposed to be the exclusive source of the "right" to use vio- lence.65 Instead of the more felicitous version in the volume edited by Gerth and Mills, I use my own translation here because it renders more precisely the terms under discussion. In this passage, Weber uses the word, "Gewaltsamkeit" -which means "violence" -eight times, modifying the noun four times with the word meaning "physical." Only at one point in the passage, and in a quote from Trotsky, does he use the term, "Gewalt," which may be trans- lated either as "violence" or as "force." "Gewaltsamkeit" is less equivocal. The Gerth translation diminishes the impact of the pas- sage by translating "Gewaltsamkeit" five times as "force" and three times as "violence."66 In the section from Wirtschaft und Gesell- schaft on political and hierocratic associations, which Weber takes up immediately after the section in which he defines power ("Macht"), these associations, from their aspect as struc- tures of domination, are treated as different species of the same genus; namely, groups with 65 Max Weber, "Politik als Beruf," Gesammelte Politische Schriften, 2. Aufl. (Tubingen, J. C. B. Mohr, 1958), S. 494. 16 From Max Weber; Essays in Sociology, p. 78.</page><page sequence="11">360 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW a head, staff, and members, organized accord- ing to a coercive principle. In this section, Henderson and Parsons translate "Gewalt- samkeit" each time as "force, " obscuring Weber's meaning, especially since they render "Zwang"-m-eaning "coercion"- as "force" at the same time, losing the distinction which Weber apparently wishes to make. At the beginning of the section, he identifies both hierocratic and political associations with the threat or practice of coercion-the former em- ploying a psychic kind, the latter, physical- naming violence as the specific form of coercion used by political groups exclusively. He makes it clear that other methods besides physical coercion are widely used by political groups, including the state, insisting, nevertheless, that the threat or use of violence is a special charac- teristic that identifies associations as "po- litical." Of course, translating terms such as "Macht," "Kraft," "Zwang," "Gewalt," and "Gewaltsamkeit" is a subtle problem of style with ample latitude for interpretation. But if a stranger to historical reality were to read the Henderson and Parsons translation, he might never guess that states were acquainted with violence. One could not receive that impression from reading Weber's own words.67 Few writers will commit themselves to an exclusive choice between authority and vio- lence as the essential principle of political ac- tion, for it appears more sound to work out formulas that keep them both in some pref- erential ratio. Likewise, few would, in the manner of Heinrich von Treitschke and Franz Oppenheimer, insist on force as the primary principle in formulas of the state; it is more usual to balance the principles of coercion and consent. Thus, MacIver writes: force holds nothing together. Force is a substitute for unity.... Coercive power is a criterion of the state, but not its essence.... When force is much in evidence it is a pathological symptom. ... It is true that there is no state where there is no overruling force. This is the differentia between the state and all other associations. There is no state where other associations arrogate to them- selves the exercise of compulsion. There is no state where there is anarchy. But the exercise of force does not make a state. ...68 67 Compare The Theory of Social and Economic Organization, pp. 154-56 with Max Weber, Wirt- schaft und Gesellschaft, 4. Aufl. (TUbingen, J. C. B. Mohr, 1956), I. Hbd. K. i. ? 17, S. 29-30. One should not infer from this truism that "society" always precedes, logically and his- torically, the state, or that social trust and cooperation precede without exception the mutual acceptance of coercion. Georg Simmel shows that purely antagonistic, coercive rela- tions have often been transformed into social tissue, that conflict can evolve into cooperation, and that coercive power can create a social tie which did not previously exist.69 The stale controversy over whether violence is a defective or an ultimate form of power, and, similarly, whether it is factitious or "essential" to the political system cannot be ignored be- cause it invades the ordinary usage as well as the technical usage of crucial terms. Neverthe- less, it is not useful to pursue the point of de- ciding whether coercion or consent is the "essence" of the state. The relative amounts of coercion and consent in any political structure are problematic and a matter for empirical judgment in each case. The most useful concept of power would not exclude from its domain either persuasion or coercion, nor would it consider either authority or violence to be more essential or ultimate. Similarly, a useful concept of the state would not be restricted either to moderate or to vio- lent states, for history is full of both. Nor is it reasonable to confine ideas of the political sys- tem to organized negotiation, bargaining, ex- change, competition, and other peaceful proc- esses, omitting violent methods. Both ex- tremes should be included, and conceptions framed in a manner that will lead the investiga- tor to uncover the empirical conditions deter- mining the presence or absence of violence. Merely to declare that political organizations may resort to violence because this kind of action is one of their characteristics is a circular line of reasoning without much consequence. More fruitful would it be to trace the processes, mark the structures of violent action, discern the conditions in which it takes place, and examine the various methods in use. Exploring in this way how and why organizations use violence may be crucial to a better understand- ing of the political system and its various forms. 68 R. M.
