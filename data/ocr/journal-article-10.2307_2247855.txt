<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-NEW BOOKS. Lectures on the Bases of Religious Belief. The Hibbert Lectures, 1893. By CHARLES B. UPTON, B.A., B.Sc., Professor of Philosophy in Man- chester College. Williams &amp; Norgate. Pp. xii., 364. THESE lectures are intended as an introduction to more elaborate works on the Philosophy of Religion such as Dr Martineau's, and are written under the influence of Martineau and of Lotze. The main contention is for the Immanence of God in man's rational, ethical and spiritual nature, as against Agnosticism and Deism on the one hand and the doctrine of an exclusive Incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth on the other. At the same time much pains is taken to distinguish the author's doctrine, which he calls Ethical Theism, from Pantheism; including under Pan- theism several current philosophies of Religion which claim for themselves the title of Theism, but which have not, according to Mr Upton, suf- ficiently freed themselves from the theological limits of fIegel In a book of this size and scope the merit we look for in the first place is that of clearly and also comprehensively marking out the bound- aries between the doctrine there advocated and the current doctrines of the day which are of chief influence and interest. This achievement Mr Upton has fairly made his own. Two Lectures on the Nature of Religious Belief and on Spiritual Insight hold the place of honour in his book, expound his thesis, and furnish the main evidence which he relies on to sustain it. The remainder of the book is occupied by comparisons of his doctrine with rival philosophies, a comparison which naturally emphasises its meaning and from time to time accumulates further proofs. Lecture iii. shows how the Agnosticism of Mr Spencer and the Positivism of Mr Harrison each deny and each affirm a part of Ethical Theism. Lecture iv. while abandoning what is called Dogmatic Religion to the tender mercies of Recent Science, tries to conciliate this latter power on behalf of Rational Religion, including Ethical Theism. Lecture vi. states the modification which is introduced by Ethical Theism into the old Cosmological Argument for the being of God. Lecture vii. attempts the task of reconciling the ethical item in Theism, God as the source of Ideals, with the Supreme Causation previously claimed and incorporated, in full view of difficulties stated even so recently as by Prof. Huxley. Lectures viii. and ix. finally exhibit the author's debt to Hegelianism and the additions which are necessary in order to rescue Theism from the narrower and colder limits which Hegelianism allows to the religious consciousness. As will be seen from this outline of its contents the book furnishes a convenient review of the present position of the Philosophy of Religion. The topics, references and quotations are well selected for the purpose. Most arguments commonly in the air are shortly noted at some passage or other, and yet the author does not waste his words on any writers except those who are really influential. Unfortunately we cannot say that he never wastes words over these latter. For the book is throughout so rich in phrases, the aim at forcible and balanced expression is so persistent, that philosophic readers may complain of a surfeit. How- ever the book coInsists of "Lectures," it is intended for commencing</page><page sequence="2">558 NEW BOOKS. students, and the author has a purpose to do something more than convince, to help the hearer to exercise more vividly his own spiritual intuitions. For while the lecturer makes it his primary business to inquire whether the progressive forms of religious belief which recent anthropology de- scribes rest -upon a "permanent basis," his procedure in this ambitious task is little more than an appeal to the reader's intuition. Out of the numerous passages which reiterate his main argument we select for quotation the following, a not too favourable one in regard to style "The most convincing evidence of the being and nature of God is to be found in the direct consciousness that our finite selves are dependent on, and indivisibly united with, a deeper and infinite Self; and that in our higher reason, in our ethical ideals, and in that love which rises above all egoistic interests, we feel ourselves in immediate relationship with elements of absolute and universal worth and authority which inevitably awake the belief that these are the expression of ultimate Reality, of the self-existent Ground and Source of finite existences." There is also a blend of another argument, a metaphysical interpretation of finite things and finite minds as "differentiations of the essential nature of the Divine Being," and from their origination in this way is to be expected "that there should be an immediate feeling of relationship in our individual minds with the Eternal Mind." But the main work of religious conviction has evidently got to be done by appealing to Con- sciousness. The author's method is indeed the one made so familiar to English readers by Hamilton and some of his masters, anid partially approved and followed by even Mill, that of first finding an Intuition or "fact of consciousness" and then surrendering our philosophic judgment to this charming but perhaps lying witness. "Consciousness," the fact seen by the psychologist or the autobiographer, changes chameleon-like into "Consciousness," the logical principle or premiss; and many of Mr Upton's pages furnish plain examples of this change. A religious philo- sopher who describes our intuitions with such elaboration and eloquence as Mr Upton does, performs a valuable service to Religion and to philo- sophic education. But he should very carefully avoid producing in the hearer's mind the illusion that he is proving or evidencing some truth which was uncertain previously; and in this respect Mr Upton's book, like most books of the kind, might, we think, have been more guarded. Aspects of Pessimism. By R. M. WENLEY, M.A., D. Sc., Lecturer on Philo- sophy in Queen Margaret College, Glasgow; Formerly Examiner in the University of Glasgow. William Blackwood and Sons: Edinburgh and London, 1894. Pp. 332. This work is a compilation of the Author's own contributions to various periodicals. It consists of six Essays, the first five of which pre- sent us with a quasi-historical view of the diverse forms in which Pessimism has manifested itself. The sixth essay is entitled " Pessimism as a System," and one cannot help thinking that this last should have stood first in the order of arrangement, since the meaning of the term Pessimism is not defined with sufficient clearness at the outset, so that it is not easy to determine whether the types which Dr Wenley portrays do or do not conform to the popular conception of Pessimism. In the first essay Dr Wenley devotes great erudition and critical research to the consideration of Pessimism amongst the Hebrews, and he embodies his conclusions on this point in the following remark; "Jewish theism, unique in theory and invincible in practice, set a limit to Jewish</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 559 despair. Yahveh and progress by Yahveh's hanid, in short, dictated a hereditary optimism to the Jews, though an optimism in which the pessimistic elements were not without place " (p. 9). The third essay is a character study of Shakespeare's Hamlet as a victim or an exponent of a pessimistic theory of life. Dr Wenley rightly describes Hamlet as a psychological or subjective drama, the action of which consists in the play of feeling of a central figure exposed to highly specialized conditions of life. Dr Wenley thinks that the keynote of Hamlet's conduct is " his despair, because blameless vengeance cannot be executed " (p. 126). Hamlet hesitates to commit one murder in expiation of another aind so finds himself in a moral cul-de-sac. This is a form of Pessimism. In the fourth essay Dr Wenley tries to show that although Goethe is popularly credited with an optimistic theory of existence, his works are really pervaded with a latent pessimistic tone which tinctures all his conclusions. Dr Wenley says that " pessimism is nothing more than the statement of the practical or moral difficulty which is formulated theoretically in that somewhat amorphous body of doctrine known as Agnosticism" (p. 129). According to this canon, then, Dr Wenley has no difficulty in proving Goethe's pessimistic tendencies, for agnostic Goethe assuredly was, as any reader of his representative works Wilhelm Meister and Faust must admit. In the concluding Essay Dr Wenley deals with modern Pessimism as systematized and formulated by Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann. Pessimism is, however, not a new theory of life, but in the present cen- tury, as Dr Wenley remarks, " the recurring wail of isolated melancholy has swelled into an inharmoniously harmonious symphony of despair" (p. 250). Schopenhauer's Pessimism is a philosophical theory which accepts Will as the only reality. On close investigation this Will turns out to be an all pervading energy in nature ever striving and struggling with insatiable restlessness. Pessimism then does not spring from un- satisfied yearning after the ideal. Even if the ideal was attained there would be no cessation of craving. Misery and suffering are inevitable conditions of existence consequent upon the infinite unrest by which we are ever goaded. " Will, the ultimately real, is essentially fraught with pain and every species of imperfection, because in its ceaseless and frantic effort to find perfect expression it is ever baffled " (p. 262). lHartmann's Pessimism is a very comprehensive system, having an olitological basis, a historical justification, and a rational conclusion. The ultimate reality of nature is an unconscious entity containing, however, the potentiality of will and idea. Idea emerges into consciousness, fed by illusions, the greatest of which is the expectation of happiness. "The early age of Greece was the period of its first great deceit."-" Full of high hopes for the future."-" The answer to this anticipation was the Romai dominion which, in time, itself embosomed terrific despair." " But as the hope that happiness might be realized on earth faded into thin air, it was succeeded by another"; "happiness was "conceived attainable by the indi- vidual in a transcendent life after death " (p. 289). With the Renascence came a third phase; revived interest in things earthly and a relegation of happiness to the future of the world emerged. Perfected humanity was henceforth the goal of human aspiration. In bondage to this illusion we of the nineteenth century for the most part have lived, and are still living. "After these three stages of illusion of the hope of a positive happiness" according to Hartmann " humanity has finally seen the folly of its endeavour ; it finally foregoes all positive happiness, and longs only for absolute painlessness, for nothingness, Nirvana. But not, as before,</page><page sequence="4">560 NEW BOOKS. this or that man, but mankind longs for nothingness, for annihilation" (p. 291). We can only add in conclusion that Dr Wenley has presented a very repulsive topic in a very attractive form. T. W. LEVIN. The Ethics of Hegel. Translated Selections from his Rechts-Philosophie, with an Introduction. By J. MACBRIDE SHERRETT, D.D., Professor of Philosophy in the Columbian University, Washington, D. C. Boston: Ginn &amp; Co., 1893. Pp. xii., 216. This volume is one of a series, each of which is to contain extracts from the ethical writings of some philosopher. It is said in the preface that undergraduates have no time to study more than one ethical system in detail, and that selections are better than text-books. Even if we assume that it is better they should study several systems slightly rather than one thoroughly, the conclusion seems doubtful. A good exposition by a com- mentator may be a coherent whole, but fragments of an author's work can scarcely be coherent, unless his system in full was confused. If there is any method in his writings they must be mutilated by such treatment. Hegel's system, to which method is the breath of life, is particularly unsuitable for presentation in extracts. And his Ethics are also almost in- capable of separate treatment. They depend so absolutely on his meta- physics, and they are so devoid of independent reality as against the higher stages of Spirit, in which they are transcended and lost, that a separate treatise on them can scarcely explain the real view which Hegel took of them. Dr Sherrett's introduction is clear and sympathetic, though a tendency may be noticed in it to emphasize, perhaps rather rudely, the somewhat shadowy connection between Hegel and orthodoxy. For example (p. 24), we find the transition from logic to Nature identified with creation by God. Hegel's account of it is no doubt obscure. But it seems clear that the freedom which he attributes to the Idea in it does not imply that the Idea could have refrained from the advance, nor that the worlds of Nature and Spirit are to be looked on as derivative, while the Idea is to be regarded as ultimate and independent. And in this case, creation seems an ambiguous phrase. Again, the identification of God with the Idea alone seems unjustified. For Hegel says (Enc. Section 1) that "G God, and God only, is the truth," and he would scarcely have been prepared to deny truth to the world of Spirit, and to confine it to the Logic. The statement (p. 34) that crime is "a step backward" seems to be more edifying than Hegelian. The conception of a step backward is one which can find no place in the dialectic method. Crime is no doubt a negative stage of the dialectic, but the negation is never lower than that which it negates, and must even be considered as higher, in those later stages of the process in which transition is merged in reflection and development. Philosophical Remains of G. C. ROBERTSON. With a Memoir. Edited by ALEXANDER BAIN, LL.D. and T. WHITTAKER, B.A. London: Williams and Norgate, 1894. Pp. xxiv., 481. "The present volume contains a collection of the more important philosophical writings of the late Prof. Croom Robertson. Outside this work, besides his volume on Hobbes, there remain his historical articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica on Abelard and Hobbes, his biographies of</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 561 the Grotes in the Dictionary of National Biography (George Grote, his wife and two brothers-John and Arthur) and other minor contributions to various periodicals." The papers here reprinted possess very varying degrees of interest. Among the most important are,-the admirable exposition of the part played by the social factor in the development of our mental life, which is entitled "How we come by our Knowledge,"-the articles on Analysis, Axioms, and Association of Ideas, which first appeared in the Encyclopaedia Britannica; those on The Physical Basis of Yind, on Psychology and Philosophy and the highly suggestive note on the Psycho- logical Theory of Extension, which are taken from the pages of Mind. The Theory of Inference. By the Rev. HENRY HUGHES, M.A. Kegan Paul, Trench, Triibner, and Co., 1894. Pp. xv., 256. A criticism of Mill's logical doctrines, intended to show that Inductioii and Deduction, though the only kinds of inference which are appropriate to the field of natural law, are unequal to the work of drawing conclusions about real and concrete things. In the field of history another kind, Illation, is necessary. Critical notice will follow. Kant's .1naugural Dissertation of 1770. Translated into English, with an Introduction and Discussion, by W. J. ECKOFF, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy and Psychology in the University of Colorado. Columbia College, N.Y., 1894. Pp. xi., 101. The translation is likely to prove useful, though it might be considerably improved by a careful revision. The Introduction and Discussion are without value. Dr Eckoff is apparently ignorant, to an inexcusable degree, of what has been written by others concerning Kant's philosophical development. His own contribution to the subject presents the appear- ance of being a series of rough notes taken down for his own use while reading Kant's precritical writings. He has an abominable trick of giving a paraphrase or quasi-quotations in oratio recta but without quotation marks, so that the reader has constanltly to pause and consider whether the pronouns in the first person stand for Kant or for himself. F. H. Jacobi. A Study in the Origin of German Realism. By NORMAN WILDE, Ph.D. Columbia College, N.Y., 1894. Pp. 77. This study may be regarded as a supplement to M. Levy Briihl's more pretentious work (cf. P. 567 of this No.). Dr Wilde treats of the "Formative Influences" which moulded Jacobi's thought, and gives a systematic analysis of his doctrine. The critical and polemical relations of Jacobi to Mendelssohn, Kant, and later thinkers, do not come within the scope of his work. Mr Wilde evidently knows his subjects and his style is clear and attractive. Biblioth&amp;que de Philosophie Contemporaine. Auguste Comte et Herbert Spencer. Contribution X l'histoire des Idees Philosophiques au XIXe Si4cle. Par E. DE ROBERTY. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. 200. In this dissertation M. E. De Roberty endeavours to portray in broad outline the most salient features of contemporary speculative philosophy. The ultra-positive scientific character of the age reposes on a latent hypo- thetical cosmology which philosophy endeavours to formulate, and to</page><page sequence="6">562 NEW BOOKS. construe to human intelligence. The outcome of this intellectual activity our author thinks may be summed up as Monism tempered by Agnosti- cism. With the latter M. De Roberty has already dealt in a previouq essay.' He proposes now to examine and elucidate in Book I. of this work " The problem of Monism in the philosophy of the present age," in Book IL. "The Monism of Auguste Comte," in Book III. "The Monism oI Herbert Spencer." In Book I. there is an attempt at an historic evolution of the conception of unity with which most readers of philosophy are tolerably familiar. The one and the many, unity and plurality, have been, as M. De Roberty tells us, respectively the soul and the body of philo- sophy in all stages of speculation. Monism or the principle of unity has assumed various guises; it has clothed itself in theism-in another age it has been the foundation of Metaphysic-to-day it calls itself Evolution. In each phase the human intellect seems impelled to the grand postulate or hypothesis of a single substance materialising, pervading and organizing all nature. This is Monism, an intellectual necessity-a scientific datum- an emotional craving. From pages 45 to 134 are discussed the doctrines of Auguste Comte. Positivism, M. De Roberty thinks, is destined to live as a method, but to perish as a creed. Comte, he complains, like Kant has sacrificed Logic to Ethic, the pure to the practical reason. The Monism of Comte is a chimera, the solidarity of human society, formulated as the science of sociology. M. De Roberty is an ultra-nominalist and only believes in plurality. He thinks that Comte's adoption of any monistic theory is inconsistent with positivism. Unity is only a symbol, a mere abridged abstraction of concrete reality, which must be always plural. The conception of abstract humanity M. De Roberty holds is a survival of the obsolete anthropomorphism which has haunted philosophy from the earliest ages.-M. De Roberty's scrutiny of Herbert Spencer's system is somewhat minute but altogether destructive. The Spencerian ontology is a monistic theory of being depending for its validity on a psychology and epistemology formulated in five essential points. 1. The ultimate criterion of truth or reality, the inconceivability of incompatibles, " l'inconceivabilit6 du contraire simultane6" (p. 138). M. De Roberty disposes of this principle as a mere logical quibble with no objective force. 2. The classification of the phenomena of consciousness as external and internal states. Of course our author has no difficulty in demon- strating that this distinction is a flagrant petitio principii, "une criante petition de principe " (p. 142). 3. The hypothesis of a tertium quid in which subject and object are identified. Again, says M. De Roberty, a mere logical illusion in which two species are gathered up as it were in a genus " la generalite ou identite de genre " (p. 145). 4. The hypothesis of a " transconscient " mode of being which gene- rates the object primarily, which again in its turn generates the subject, so that an unknown whole manifests itself as the envelope of the object, which is again the envelope of the subject. This M. De Roberty finds is only an illicit derivation of the concrete from the abstract. 5. A classification of the phenomena of consciousness as successive and contemporaneous states, which constitute our apprehension of time and space. These two species of mental phases resolve themselves finally into that unity which is on the one side a mode of knowing, on the other a mode of being. 1 Agnosticisme.</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 563 M. de Roberty accuses Spencer's method of deducing the conlerete from the abstract and then making the former a proof of the reality of the latter. But the kernel of Spencer's Monism is the conception of organic unity, and this M. De Roberty leaves unattacked. T. W. LEVIN. La Psychotogie de t'Amour. Par GASTON DANVILLE, Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. iii., 169. Love is the systematic direction of the sexual instinct to one person of the opposite sex to the absolute exclusion of all others. The main psycho- logical difficulty connected with it is the apparent absence of adequate motive for the exclusive selection of the special object. This distinguishes the passion of love in the proper sense of the word from the relative systematisation of the sexual impulse, produced by its union with other specific tendencies, such as friendship, esteem, vanity, and sympathy. Relative systematisation of this kind is more cornmon than love in the narrower sense, and the two are frequently confused. But the grand passion is unmistakeably marked off by distinctive features. Apart from the apparent want of motive for its absolutely exclusive selection of the special object, the experience of lovers bears witness to the perfectly unique nature of the emotion. It is indescribable, because it is like nothing else. Moreover it is sometimes not merely without assignable basis in ordinary interests, but actually opposed to such interests; and when this is the case, it overbears in its headlong career all considerations of worldly prudence and of morality, often leading to the extremes of folly and crime. This and some other of its features seem to indicate that it is a patho- logical state, to be classed as obsession by the fixed idea. This view is rejected by M. Danville. He thinks that he can trace the genesis of the passion in the normal course of phylogenetic evolution, and he thinks that it is distinguished from the various forms of insanity by being in its general tendency useful rather than harmful to the iindividual and to the race. There is no sufficient proof of the last point and the first is treated in a somewhat vague and unsatisfactory way. His account of the psycho- logical genesis of love in the individual is given in a few pages at the close of the volume. The basis of his explanation is the association of the excitement of the sexual instinct with accompanying experiences of our ordinary mental life. This association gives to these experiences a special quality which forms a rallying point of community leading to their union in a systematic synthesis. The product of this synthesis remains uncon- scious until it is excited from without by some person of the opposite sex who excites experiences which conform to it and blend with it. Thus all 'falling in love' is the sudden realisation of an unconscious and uncon- sciously formed idea. " Every normal adult possesses without knowing it this unconscious synthesis, which merely represents a latent power of virtual love." M. Danville may at least claim the credit of having fully realised the nature and difficulties of his problem. His )roposed solution is probably on the right lines, but it is obscurely expressed, and in any case a much more detailed analysis is required than he has supplied. Philosophie moral et politique. ,Etudes par J.-E. ALAUX, Prof. de Faculte, Prof. de Philosophie X l'Ecole des Lettres d'Alger. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1893. Pp. 409. Lucidly written and printed in large type, these ' studies ' are for the most part reprinted essays, articles, lectures and addresses, the first two</page><page sequence="8">564 NEW BOOKS. or three on moral and aesthetic philosophy, the remainder on questions of applied ethics. The philosophic standpoint is Intuitionalist; the religious attitude is Theistic. The first essay, 'Des Variations de la Morale' is an attempt to detect the fundamental unity of the moral principle underlying the profound differences, amounting to logical con- trariety, between the positive moralities of different times and places. In the schools there are still three points of controversy: Is morality independent? What is the sanction of morality? What is the Good? In practice the Good has always been the one aim. But ultimately le bien c'est le bien vouloir, however greatly, through commission or omission, through ignorance and weakness, the collective good will has erred in seeking the Good. Or rather Goods: progress has been from war to peace, from slavery to liberty, from privilege to equality, from despotism to justice. The second essay, ' La Moralit6 spiritualiste,' deplores the fact that philosophy, once the handmaid of theology, should have exchanged her office, not for liberty, but for the service of science, a harder yoke et d'une momns qrande dame, and holds, that, while philosophy and science have need each of the other, the ' moral idea' is the absolute inconcussum quid of philosophy, where it must cry halt to science, just as imperiously as science forbids philosophy to hold hypotheses contrary to its laws. Pour et contre l'Enseignement Philosophique. Extrait de la Revue Bleue. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. 178. Some recent changes proposed in the curriculum of study pursued in the Universities and the Higher Schools of France, seem to have aroused a controversy amongst those interested in educational matters which foLnd vent in a series of articles and letters appearing in the well-known periodical La Revue Bleue during the spring of the present year. The reform in question touched the abolition or curtailment of the special course of philosophical reading which constitutes the work of pupils during the final year of their academical career. This philosophical course is made up of Psychology, Logic, Metaphysic and Ethic, concluding with the general history of Philosophy. The feeling awakened by the attempt to modify the period allotted to the study of philosophy under these four divisions has naturally expressed itself in favour of, or against, the utility of philosophy as a special branch of education. M. Vand6rem has led off and wound up the polemic, the principal contributions to which are collected by him and comprised in the tract before us. M. Vanderem tells us in his prologue how the plan of higher education adopted in France, had been framed on the lines laid down by the Jesuits in the 17th and 18th centuries (p. 4). Their practice was to devote nine years to instruction in the usual subjects of a liberal training, languages, rhetoric, geometry &amp;c. During this period the speculative topics which philosophy is supposed especially to embrace were most rigidly excluded from the notice of the pupils, and all discussion of them was sternly pro- hibited. On entering the 10th year of study, however, this bann was withdrawn, the veil was lifted and suddenly without any previous prepara- tion the student found himself in an unaccustomed atmosphere charged with recondite problems and the sublime mysteries of life and mind, the destiny of man and the ultimate foundations of morality. Such questions were presented to a class of bewildered pupils who were expected to gallop through a course of so-called philosophy in one year-to scale under the perfunctory guidance of unsympathetic Professors, heights which the most</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 565 powerful intellects had been unable to surmount in twenty centuries. It is against this degradation of philosophy, this waste of time, expended in the attempt to convert unsophisticated youths into Cynics and Sceptics that M. Vand6rem protests, although we do not quite gather from his utterances whether it is the absolute teaching of philosophy as an element of educa- tion to which he objects or only the inadequacy of the method in which it is taught. Succeeding the introduction of M. Vand6rem we have thirteen letters from men of light and leading in the philosophical and educational world of France, amongst whom we recognize such names as Ribot, Janet, Fouill6e, H. Taine, &amp;c. M. Ribot completely concurs with M. Vand6remn's strictures on the existing mode of teaching philosophy, judging as he says from results which are brought under his notice as Examiner. He thinks the Professor whilst teaching should take more account of the capacity of his audience and not soar suddenly into too rarefied an atmosphere. M. Janet traverses the allegations of M. Vand6rem with regard to (1) the results, (2) the matter, (3) the manner of the teaching of philosophy hitherto in vogue in the higher schools of France. His attitude is purely defensive and he scarcely does more than parry the attacks of his adver- sary. He points to many distinguished contemporaries (p. 42) who are noted in every department of practical life although they have undergone during their youthful career the disabling ordeal of the class of philosophy. He endeavours to show that a disbelief in the existence of matter is a wholesome antidote to the positive proclivities of the age, and he answers the complaint of the undue disparity between the teaching of the professor and the capacity of the pupils by urging that nothing is more fascinating to the young than the mysterious and semi-intelligible. M. Fouill6e, pp. 57 to 81, advocates the retention of a special class for Philosophy, principally as a corrective to the tendency of a democratic age to exclusively technical training. Men require to be citizens as well as engineers, chemists, lawyers, &amp;c., and only a course of philosophy can remind youths that human life is not governed entirely by steam and electricity. M. Fouill6e recommends Professors to dwell more on the harmony than on the antagonism of the various schools of philosophy and to encourage the constructive rather than the critical faculty of his class. M. Fouillee concludes his paper by an elaborate syllabus containing sixty-one topics to be discussed by a model Class of Philosophy. -A letter of the late M. Taine cited by an anonymous contributor (p. 162) insists very strongly on the danger of dissipation in philosophical reading. For a beginner in philosophy he says eclecticism is worse than useless. Master one system, it matters not which, but master it in its entirety, and so the stuidy of philosophy is a splendid gymnastic. M. Vand6rem in his summing up (p. 164) claims to have established with the concurrence of the highest authorities that the philosophical course existing in the public schools and universities of France must be ended or mended. We should say that in our opinion the testimony in his favour is not quite so overwhelming as he would have us believe. In fact we cannot find one of the correspondents who grants him an unqualified adhesion. The whole question is that of the growing claims of the new learning to take the place of the old. What the age requires is a new " Instauratio Magna." But such a work must not be undertaken by a specialist, a sciolist, or a journalist. T. W. LEVIN.</page><page sequence="10">566 NEW BOOKS. Spinoza. Par LAON BRUNSCHVICG, Professeur agr6g6 de philosophie au lycee de Tours. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. 224. This is purely an exposition of the philosophy of Spinoza from Spi- noza's own standpoint, without any attempt to criticise him, or to recast his thoughts in a modern form. As a mere restatement of Spinozism it has remarkable merit. It is written throughout in lucid and graceful French; it is admirably arranged, and it is based on profound and intimate knowledge of Spinoza's text. The ethical and religious motive is given its due place from the outset, as the key to the whole system, and the inestimable value of Spinoza's practical teaching is set in a clear light. Though the work is a mere restatement, it nevertheless obviates by implication many current objections to the doctrines expounded. Indeed we may say that all difficulties which are merely based on misunderstand- ing, are here disposed of purely by the clearness and completeness of the exposition. The account of Spinoza's theory of knowledge, in Chapter II. on Method, is especially good, and its significance is again brought out at the close in Ch. VII. on Eternity. Ch. V. on Passion, is remarkable as containing a really successful statement of the psychological details of Spinoza's theory of the emotions. The intellectual love of God, and the doctrine of the eternity of the soul, are extremely well treated. Finally, the story of Spinoza's life is told at the end of the book in a most interest- ing manner, so as to exhibit it as a practical embodiment of his philosophy. L'Anne'e Philosophique. Publiee sous la direction de F. PILLON, Quatribme Ann6e, 1893. Paris: F6lix Alcan. Pp. 316. This fourth number contains three important articles: (1) "A philo- sophical study of the doctrine of Jesus," by M. Renouvier; (2) "God according to the 'Neo-Criticisme,"' by M. Jauriac; "The Evolution of Idealism in the Eighteenth Century," by M. Pillon. Of these the longest and perhaps the most interesting is M. Pillon's contribution, which treats in a very thorough and systematic way of Malebranche and his Critics. Malebranche is represented as being the founder of Eighteenth Century Idealism. He was only debarred by theo- logical considerations from a full anticipation of the doctrine of Berkeley. The Revue Bibliographique includes notices of all books of any degree of importance bearing on philosophy, which have appeared during 1893. Fuller notice follows in due course. Le sentiment et la pensee, et leu6rs princ4paux aspects physiologiques. Par A. GODFERNEAUX, Docteur 6s Lettres. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. xi., 224. 'Le sentiment,' or the emotional side of mental life, coincides, for M. Godfernaux, with the conative. All emotion has, according to him, its physiological correlative in the repression or liberation of organic ten- dencies to movement. The general purport of his book is to show the dependence of what he calls Association of Ideas, on motor tendencies, and the corresponding emotional states. Much space is devoted to illus- tration of this point, by reference to the phenomena of mental disease, of mania, melancholia, hypochondria, ecstasy, and chronic delirium. On the whole, this part of his work is good and suggestive, but his statement that, in mania, thought exists in detachment from emotion, and that, in melancholia, emotion exists in detachment from thought, breaks down when confronted with the facts as he himself states them. M.

Here, too, he is largely successful in sustaining his general thesis. The book is certailily worth reading. La Philosophie de Jacobi. Par L. LAVY-BRUHL, Professeur au Lyc6e Louis- le-Grand et X l'Eicole libre des sciences politiques. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. xxxviii., 263. This book is extremely well written and extremely interesting. The philosophy of Jacobi is in its essence a protest against the possibility of all philosophy. Its cardinal principle is that real existence must be im- mediately apprehended through feeling, sentiment or instinct, and that the whole function of the understanding consists in analysing and generalising data supplied to it by the senses or by the 'heart.' Knowledge of God and freedom is knowledge through the emotions. To attempt to deduce these fundamental verities by ratiocination, is, from the nature of the case, to deny them. To explain a thing is to assign the conditions of its existence; but God and freedom are unconditioned realities. The real interest of Jacobi's philosophical activity lies in his critical and polemical attitude to the various systems which succeeded each other in Germany, during his long life of seventy-six years. He argues throughout to support his own foregone conclusions, treating with uncompromising hostility all doctrines which denied freedom and the personality of God, or which attempted to base these tenets on any other foundation than that of immediate experience. His first controversy was directed against Moses Mendelssohn. This discussion formed a turning-point in the history of philosophy in Germany, by bringing into prominence the system of Spinoza, which afterwards combined with that of Kant to generate the philosophies of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Jacobi urged that all philo- sophy which is true to itself must end in Spinozism, i.e. the explanation of the Universe through the principle of logical identity. He put forward this thesis as an argumentum ad hominem, intending to intimidate his opponents by shewing the nature of the confusions to which their pro- cedure legitimately led. But what he succeeded in effecting was the precise opposite of this. He gave a great impetus to the study of Spinoza, which resulted in an enthusiastic appreciation of the Spinozistic method and teaching, and influenced the subsequent course of speculation in a way directly opposed to Jacobi's tendencies. Jacobi's criticism of Kant is well-known. It has the great merit of having been among the very first to discern the important significance of Kant's work, and it has also the merit of having detected with singular insight its weak points, both in the theoretical and practical sphere. The objections against the doctrine of things-in-themselves, and against the formalism of the categorical imperative, which are now generally regarded as unanswerable, were clearly and distinctly stated by Jacobi. His criticism of Fichte is of less importance, as it consists mainly in a re- iteration of what he had already urged against Mendelssohn. Schelling he appears to have totally misunderstood. The romantic school represented by Schleiermacher and the Schlegels had many points of positive affinity with him; but his own feeling towards the romnanticists seems to have been mainly one of antipathy. They appeared to him to be too frivolous, making the most sacred interests merely subject-matter for the play of fancy. On the whole Jacobi appears to have become more rigid and intolerant as he got older: in his early days he could feel admiration and affection for Spinoza, emphasising the essentially religious sentiment</page><page sequence="12">568 NEW BOOKS. which underlay what in Jacobi's view was formally atheism. But in the close of his life he seems to have lost this power of sympathetic discrimi- nation, and to have felt nothing but resentment and repugnance for all writers who denied or ignored the personality of God. He thus became isolated from all but the immediate circle of his personal admirers, finding little in contemporary thought that was not odious and repugnant to his deepest sentiments and convictions. L'Ide'e du Phenomene. Par EMILE BOIRAC, Professeur de Philosophie au Lyc6e Condorcet, Docteur es Lettres. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1894. Pp. 347. In this " analytical and critical study," M. Boirac tracks the notion of phenomenon, successor to substance and fundamental idea of contemporary philosophy, through the several systems; examines the realist conception of it as appearance, the idealist conception of it as representation, and the positivist conception of it as change (pp. 10-11),-to land eventually for himself in a species of "reformed Leibnizianism" (p. 344), conceiving " phenomenon and substance as inseparable because they are the two com- plementary, correlative aspects under which all real existence appears to us and to itself" (pp. 345-6). He realizes and clearly states the three great difficulties in the way of Monism, the duality of phenomenon and being, the duality of movement and thought, of matter and mind, and the multi- plicity of individual consciousnesses; and while claiming by the present criticism to have helped to get rid of the two first, leaves the third,-the reconciliation of the multiplicity of iildividual subjects with the unity of the universal subject-as the problem for the metaphysics of the future. Les lois psychologiques de l'e'volution des peuples. Par GUSTAVE LE BON. Paris: F. Alcan, 1894. Pp. 176. The first of the four books into which this work is divided treats of the psychological characters of races. The thesis propounded is that though a race is to a large extent capable of mental modification at different periods of its existence, yet that these fluctuations are only transient and that they are confined within fixed limits by certain fundamental psychological cha- racteristics which are transmitted by heredity. This position is supported partly by evidence adduced in this volume, partly by reference to previous works of the author. He appears to us to lay too much stress on physio- logical heredity as distinguished from social inheritance in his account of the continuity of the " soul " of a race from generation to generation. He also sets up an abstract antithesis between character and intelligence which will not, we think, sustain critical scrutiny. He thinks that what is of paramount importance in the racial soul are practical rather than theoretical aptitudes and tendencies. Thus in his fourth book, which deals with the decline and fall of civilisations, he chiefly emphasises the moral decay which makes an overcivilised people an easy prey to robuster races far inferior in intelligence but animated and guided by enthusiasm for "ideas." The truth is that M. le Bon is here measuring intelligence and character by disparate standards. He estirnates intelligence merely by the variety and complexity of intellectual life, whereas he estimates character merely by its unity and consistency. The second book shows that religions and arts are never simply transmitted from one nation to another; they always suffer radical transformation in the process. The third book investigates the leading conditions which modify the psychological characters of races. The respective influence of ideas, of religious beliefs, and of "great men"</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 569 is examined. The religious factor is regarded as most important; but the writer appears to give a very wide application to the word religion; he says that the French revolution was dominated by a religious ideal. In discussing the r6le of great inen he contrasts the discoverers of genius who advance civilisation with the "fanatics and the victims of hallucination" who "create history." The fourth book we have already referred to. It contains an interesting discussion of the social condition of modern Europe. M. le Bon thinks that the Latin races are in desperate case, and that the Germans are no better off. They are rushing headlong to socialism which is ruin. England and the United States are in a better position. But the future of the world rests with Russia. In conclusion we must add that the book is full of interest from beginning to end, though its value is somewhat marred by the French tendency to follow a one-sided idea blindly and exclusively, where an Englishman would "hedge" and a German would seek a "higher synthesis." Die Anfdnge der Kunst. Von ERNST GROSSE, Dr. Phil. Freiburg i. B. und Leipzig: J. C. B. Mohr, 1894. Pp. vii., 301. This is a work of great interest and value both for the psychologist and the student of aesthetics. It contains a careful examination of the artistic culture of those races which subsist purely by hunting, and by collection of vegetable products,-the natives of Australia, the Andaman Islanders, the Bushmen, the Eskimo, and the Fuegians. With the exception of architecture, all the forms of art which are current among the most civilised peoples appear also among these most primitive races. Cosmetic or personal adornment, decorative art, picture-making and carving, dancing, poetry (lyric, epic) and dramatic), and music, are 'everywhere clearly and distinctly traceable. It would thus appear that the art im- pulse is a common possession of the whole human race. A further point which is well brought out in the volume, is the remarkable uniformity of character which pervades the artistic activity of peoples so widely distinct in racial character, and without communication with each other. Except in the case of music, this uniformity is traceable to the common con- ditions to which all are subject, inasmuch as their subsistence depends upon the chase. The general direction of their activity, as determined by the form in which the fundamental practical need of finding food takes khape, dominates their whole circle of ideas and interests. This is most conspicuously seen, on the artistic side, in their painting and graving. Their pictures consist almost entirely in life-like reproductions of animals and men; they reproduce accurately what by the conditions of their existence they are forced to observe accurately; and the technical skill they display has its propaedeutic in the acquisition of manual dexterity required for the making of weapons effective in the chase. The same fuudamental aesthetic principles of rhythm, symmetry, contrast, gradation, and harmony, which regulate the productions of civilized art, are equally traceable in that of the lowest savages. In these points the Bushmen and Eskimo are at one with the Athenians and Florentines. In view of this fundamental agreement the differences be- tween primitive and developed forms of art seem rather quantitative than qualitative. " The sensibilities manifest in primitive art are more crude and circumscribed: its materials are scantier, its forms are poorer and coarser; but in its essential motives, means, and ends, the primaeval art is one with the art of all ages." What relation does the artistic activity of primitive peoples bear to the practical exigencies of the struggle for existence? It might be sup- 38</page><page sequence="14">570 NEW BOOKS. posed at the first blush that the diversion of energy in the direction of mere play ought to be a practical disadvantage, but Dr Grosse clearly shews that this is a mistake. Decorative art promotes technical skill; personal adornment and dancing play an important part in the intercourse of the sexes, and so tend to the improvement of the breed. Poetry, dancing and music inspire combatanits with ardour and courage, and so increase the strength of the resistance presented by a social group to hostile attacks. But the most weighty and beneficial influence exercised by art on practical life, consists in the strengthening and extension of social cohesion. Dancing and poetry are best adapted for this purpose, and in primitive states of society it is dancing which does most to bind society together. Hence we find that primitive dances are highly de- veloped and elaborate, so that our performances in this line appear by comparison to be imperfect survivals analogous to rudimentary organs. What sculpture was to the Greeks, architecture in the middle ages, painting in the Renaissance, and poetry in the Europe of to-day, such is dancing to the Australian aborigine,-an embodiment of the social ideal. It is worth noting that this practical usefulness of primitive art depends on its being pursued for its own sake, and not for ulterior ends. Art must first be art before it can be anything else, and it must therefore in the first instailce seek only its own realisation. Psyckiatrie fur Aerzte und Stuzdierende. Von TH. ZIEHEN. Berlin: Fried- rich Wreden, 1894. Pp. ix, 470. This text-book has at least two features of distinct interest. It com- mences with a psychological description of the symptoms of insanity in which the author follows the thoroughgoing association psychology adopted in his Leitfaden der physiologischen Psychologie. Although one may disagree with his doctrines, it must be acknowledged that they become in Prof. Ziehen's hands the basis of a clear and consistent account of morbid mental states. The second feature of interest is the classification, which differs con- siderably in one point from that ordinarily adopted in Great Britain, where nearly all cases of acute insanity are grouped together under the heading of mania. Most of these would by Prof. Ziehen be regarded as cases of paranoia, the cognitive side of mental life being the one primarily and chiefly affected, while he would restrict the term 'mania' to a con- dition, the opposite of melancholia, in which the chief change is an increase in the pleasurable feeling tone of mental states. Paranoia may be acute or chronic, with two main varieties according to the predominance of sensory phenomena such as hallucinations, or ideational phenomena, as delusions and incoherence. The other sections contain much that is interesting and original, and the book as a whole is a valuable contribution to the systematisation of our knowledge of mental pathology. Ueber Zeit und Raum. [Philosophische Vortrdge herausgegeben von der philosophischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin. iII. Folge. 1 Heft.] Von PRO- FESSOR Dr. A. DORING. R. Gaertner, Berlin, 1894. Pp. 41. Space and time are not subjective forms as Kant held. They are as truly constituents of the object as are the things and processes to which we attribute spatial and temporal predicates. What distinguishes them from other ingredients entering into the constitution of the world is that they stand ouitside the relation of agent to patient. Professor Doring expresses</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 571 this by saying that though they are real they are not actual (wirklich). To be actual is to be operative,-to be in some sense an agency. But space and time are immobile conditions, neither suffering nor producing change. They cannot properly be said to produce anything. But on the other hand they are the real (not merely the logical) conditions of all processes and of all products. This is Dr Doring's general point of view. His application of it in the elucidation of special points is interesting and instructive. From analysis of the general characters of actual existence in time and space, he deduces the general characters of time and space themselves, inasmuch as they condition whatever is temporal or spatial. Die Gotteslehre des Gregor von Nyssa. Von Dr. W. MEYER. Leipzig: Gustav Fock, 1894. Pp. 38. Gregory, whose date is 331-394, is treated by Dr Meyer as a typical example of the blending of Christian faith with Greek Philosophy and especially with Neoplatonism. "The same man, who, qua philosopher, accentuates the Conception of God as pure being, infinite and absolute, quh Christian clings to the personality of the divine being with all the fibres of his heart." As the child of an uncritical age, he failed to feel the incompatibility of these antithetic points of view. Of course this was only possible because the metaphysical element in his thought took the form of mysticism. Dzieje Filosofii w zarysie. A Sketch of the History of Philosophy. By Dr. MAURICE STRASZEWSKI, Professor in the Jagellonian University. Vol. i. Pp. 411. This is to be the first of five volumes ; it contains a general introduc- tion to the history of Philosophy, and an accoiXnt of the development of speculative thought in India, China, Egypt and Western Asia. The second will be devoted to philosophy in Greece, the third to Mediaeval scholasticism, and the two last to modern philosophy. In the present work the author names a good many Ernglish writers whose researches and translations have been of use to him, especially as concerns the chapters about India (Muir, Haig, Monier Williams, Ballantyne, Cole- brooke, Davies and others). The book is written with much care and completeness, and it is a pity that not one Englishman out of ten thousand will be able to judge for himself what good use Prof. Straszewski has made of his numerous English sources.
