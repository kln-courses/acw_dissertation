Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 250 pages $19.95 (paper) ...what we have, for fairly obscure purposes, is some thing like a Potemkin family. It may seem they are another "front," not "for" politics alone but a profounder vacuum. -Tom Cohen Tom Cohen's Ideology and Inscription surveys the critical scene to day, looking for theoretical lodgings in a most inhospitable land scape. Cohen finds that in current intellectual debates "politics" is frequently confounded by a mimetic bias that occludes a truly revo lutionary project of reevaluation. If this is true - as he contends it is - then the usual understanding of cultural studies as a more politi cally legitimate successor to literary theory is not as straightforward as it would appear. According to most accounts, post-structuralism led to a valuable understanding of the problematic nature of lan guage, offering lessons on the exclusions that constituted every sig nifying regime, yet its self-reflexive and allegorical aspects produced a monotonous demonstration of "aporia" or "undecidabilIity." What ever philosophical import adhered to Derrida's original contribu Qui Parle Vol. 12, No. 1 Spring/Summer 2000</page><page sequence="2">178 REVIEW ESSAY tions was lost in the American version of deconstruction cum new criticism. Its metaphysical skepticism refrained from value judgments and eroded every basis for political commitment. The textualization of history was a valuable reminder, perhaps, but in practice led to the effacement of power-relations within culturally specific networks of meaning. Consequently, as Cohen recounts, in the early eighties, criticism became burdened with a sense of exhaustion. This fatigue was not helped by the predictability of deconstructive conclusions, now reinforced by a generation of Yale-educated students mulling over the same canonical texts as de Man. A series of routine attacks "against theory" surfaced, arguing the strategic necessity of agency in place of the allegorical circularity of texts content with mere na vel-gazing. A variety of antidotes appeared: new historicism and its investigations of contextual framing; the pragmatism of Richard Rorty and Cornel West that retrieved a distinctively American tradition of practical political engagement; a cultural studies that focused on the social construction of individual identity through categories like gender and race. With a new focus on the outside- practical needs, autobiographical styles, political commitment, situated agency, and the historical economies of meaning - cultural studies could still accommodate theory, only now on the inside as a tool, method, or technique for change. In returning to this institutional history, Cohen wants to argue that not only has cultural studies failed to achieve its ostensible po litical goals, but literary theory still has radical possibilities for trans formation that have remained unexplored. Undoubtedly, cultural studies rejuvenated the academy by offering novel objects for analysis and a new sense of social urgency, yet in its myriad forms of new historicism, neopragmaticism, identity politics, and ethnic studies, all these critical projects surreptitiously reintroduced a mimetic and naively referential idea of politics at their foundation. The end prod uct was a re-assertion of subjective agency haunted by an older humanism. As Cohen summarizes, "To a degree such reclaimed 'subjectivities' and their associated motifs (return to the everyday, to socio-figural context, the 'body,' to lived 'life') involved a return to familiar names and mimetic epistemological models" (5). In short, this leftist trajectory was surprisingly coincident with a return to a</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ESSAY 179 more conservative politics. Cohen's critique, however, is not in the service of reinstituting the hegemony of theory but in collapsing, once and for all, the misleading dualism of theory and practice, intellect and commitment, upon which so much regressive postur ing has depended. In returning to the epistemology of the political, Cohen locates in those linguistic preoccupations deemed "aporetic" a transformative moment that he associates with the terms material ity and inscription. But before exploring these terms, it is important to discern what Cohen's enterprise is not. Although the volume's subtitle proudly pro claims itself an investigation of cultural studies, its chapters seem to eschew the detailed engagements that one might expect. Except for a nuanced engagement with Andrew Ross, Cohen avoids all of the key figures of new historicism and identity politics. Rather than a defect, however, this serves as a valuable reminder that Cohen is not actually opposing or critiquing cultural studies at all. In a lengthy central chap ter, Cohen usefully distinguishes between cultural studies as a valu able initial shift in vocabularies and as a secondary revision that retroactively curtailed its starting promise. He argues that the limita tions of cultural studies have little to do with the objects or objectives that it purports to have, but rather stem from the way that a certain genealogical pedigree has been applied. Reframed with reference to Habermas' communication or Bourdieu's contextual and institutional historicism, this institutionalization of cultural studies also left it a flat, sociological program that was severely handicapped by a famil iar model of reference and agency.' Cohen's problem, then, is not with cultural studies in its various familiar incarnations, but rather with what he calls "a cultural studies imaginary," that is, "a way this project has been genealogized, appropriated within critical politics, stigmatized and hailed as a 'sociological' enterprise" (99). This helps explain Cohen's specific strategy as he passes over the contemporary practitioners of cultural studies in order to focus on its genealogy. In place of the semi-official pedigree of Habermas, Bourdieu, and Stuart Hall, Cohen offers provocative allegorical readings of three crucial icons for modern thought: Benjamin, de Man, and Bakhtin. Emblem atically, the opposition of de Man and Bakhtin comes to epitomize the radically false opposition between post-structuralist theory and</page><page sequence="4">180 REVIEW ESSAY dialogic cultural studies. By transforming the relationships between these heavily invested figures, Cohen hopes to alter the constellation configuring our dominant social imaginary - replacing the cultural studies pedigree with a truly Nietzschean genealogy. But I want to maintain that insofar as the book is seen merely as a polemic with cultural studies, its true value remains unappreci ated. If de Man and Bakhtin do not prove to be trustworthy repre sentations of institutionalized positions, this is because each one folds into the other, offering a more complex rhetorical strategy than any antithesis can suggest. Therefore, we must first turn to one of Cohen's critical ciphers - the "abjected" Paul de Man - in order to understand how Cohen uses a certain version of de Man's "mate riality" as a model of ideology and strategy for intervention. Then, I want to examine the performative dimension of this genealogy, situ ating the opposition to cultural studies within the very texture and tone of the book's language. This is not, however, to level some charge concerning stylistic tics but to recognize that cultural stud ies is more than a current academic movement, representing in stead a structural moment within Cohen's own theory of ideology that inflects his very vocabulary. Since it can be shown that "cul tural studies" is itself an ideological after-effect of that very materi ality Cohen proposes as a transformational tool, cultural studies cannot be reduced to some temptation to be avoided, ridiculed, or opposed. Therefore, I want to allegorize Cohen's own polemic with cultural studies through a discussion of how he reads de Man's es say on Bakhtin. Considering the positional complexities of that en gagement, I would suggest that Cohen's rhetorical traps and feints - what I call, after his own comment on Hitchcock's Sabotage, his Potemkin politics - are far more complex than one might first al low. Considering Bakhtin's own circulation of "intentionally sabo taged figures" like dialogue or carnival, which come to mean something very different from what they officially purport, I want to suggest that Cohen's own transformational imperative operates simi larly - as an inhabitation of an official "political" vocabulary that he, nevertheless, ironically inflects and transforms without, how ever, abandoning. Only from within this prospective warping of an institutional context does Cohen's own genealogy take shape.</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ESSAY 181 Cornerstones The slightly disreputable remains of de Man's work provides Cohen with an opportunity both to explore the theoretical commitments of contemporary cultural studies and to evolve a new, finely nuanced reading of de Man's late work. Furthermore, de Man's troubled signa ture serves as a convenient condensation for attacks against decon struction and post-structuralist theory as they have become a part of our institutional history. Reviewing the now-routine dismissals of deconstruction's allegorical insularity from the political world, Cohen finds these attacks to be somewhat threadbare, showing after a time their highly formalized and disingenuous natures. Indeed, detectable behind the palpable anxiety and gleeful ressentiment that emerged around the wartime writings, one can now see that de Man was actu ally a dangerous threat who was savagely abjected by the academy so as to serve as the "founding sacrifice" beneath the edifice of cul tural studies - an inaugural act of sacrifice that Cohen wryly com pares to the Andean practice of placing "llama fetuses under new building sites" (32). Rehearsing two recent polemics - one by Jeffrey Nealon, the other by Mas'ud Zavarzadeh - we find the usual com plaints of a deconstruction that drifts into a rarefied space of pure language, indefinitely deferring true revolutionary action (Zavarzadeh), and a de Man, more specifically, who domesticates Derrida's body of work into a merely literary reading whose telos is the blackhole of "unreadability" (Nealon). But for Cohen, such dismissals only dem onstrate that these "increasingly misdirected and mechanical" argu ments against an apolitical de Man actually reveal the extremely po litical nature of his writing. For de Man, language was never the interiorizing, subjective, nonpolitical realm that it was conveniently misconstrued to be. As Cohen's references to Althusser seek to argue, "language" for de Man was a radically exterior, thoroughly public phenomenon that had more in common with Althusser's ritualized ideological state apparatuses, with their installation of a subjective habitus, than with belles Iettres. Even more, in the late work posthu mously published as Aesthetic Ideology, de Man focuses on the "ma teriality of language" in order to imply a specific technology of cul tural intervention. "Materiality" increasingly came to dominate de Man's late works,</page><page sequence="6">182 REVIEW ESSAY linked as it was with a non-temporal but even more emphatically historical mode of the event. In The Resistance to Theory, for instance, he pauses on translation's privilege as an approach towards what Benjamin calls the reine Sprache, or "pure language," of literal trans lation, a desemanticized space that exists in no positive sense except as "the permanent disjunction which inhabits all languages as such."2 Such a "pure language" coincides with what he will call in the Aes thetic Ideology Kant's "materialism." Most prominent in his "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," de Man turns towards Kant's injunction to regard the ocean as the poets do, namely "by what the eye reveals," in order to locate a materialism that is irreducible to any empiricism and entirely negative - "purely material, devoid of any semantic or intellectual complication."3 Materiality thus appears as an updated, and perhaps misleading, name for precisely those mo ments of "aporia" and "undecidability" that had all along served as hallmarks of de Man's readings. But instead of pointing to moments of stoppage that deadlock the system and close down further discus sion, materiality convokes a zone or loop through which all language necessarily passes. "Translation," for instance, is a possibility housed within every native language, just as Kant's "sublime" lingers behind every judgment of taste. Rather than closing down further movement, materiality brings already installed meanings to a crisis, precipitating something akin to what the Russian formalists called estrangement or defamiliarization - the sloughing-off of previously encrusted mean ings so that only a degree-zero of signification remained. As H6lderlin might say, sometimes language itself is wie wenn am Freiertag. But, crucially, this is not the terminus of de Man's itinerary, though it is undoubtedly the stop where so many of his detractors disembark. Reference is not in any sense permanently suspended or bracketed by the internal disjunctions of a text. From this zero-point of desemanticization an inevitable relapse into signification occurs. Aware that he was being seen as just another formalist, de Man openly critiqued Roland Barthes' semiotic self-reference as it ap peared in his Mythologies, as well as other formalist practitioners like Genette, Todorov, Greimas, and later Michael Riffaterre4 Lan guage is irrepressibly referential and semantic, de Man argued; as he once joked in slightly sinister overtones about the mean ingful</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ESSAY 183 ness of language, "Nobody is suggesting that we should do away with it."5 Here we encounter de Man's insistence on the "aberrance" of reference: meaning does not generate a reliable correspondence between signifier and referent, yet it also does not throb in quiet, onanistic self-reference. Instead, it is "aberrant" - suffering a se mantic disinvestiture that allows for novel modes of signification. The disjunction in meaning that de Man signals under materiality is not simply a potential confusion in meaning (parapraxes or puns, the showpieces in so many imitative works) or an excess of pos sible, even mutually exclusive, interpretations (often assimilated to a pancaked version of Derridean dissemination). Rather, this dis junction is a moment of passage, of transition or "translation," that adheres to all cultural systems of meaning. In the Benjamin essay, de Man heralds this as "a wandering, an errance, a kind of perma nent exile" that reminds us that all modes of reference are deeply political and open to contestation and hegemony.6 Politics does not demand referential univocality but resides in the very acts of articu lation and foreclosure that manage this inevitable errance. Cohen's book is crucial in marking this shift in perspective. Whereas de Man's political potential has been inhibited by a vocabulary focused on "aporia" and "allegory," materiality opens up a space of resignification precisely insofar as it allows for an evacuation of prior meanings. Instead of stoppage, de Man sees materiality as a circuit in the re production of every system of cultural meaning: a "motion" or even "the dimension of futurity" lodged in the very structure of language. Politics always courts a certain "necessarily nihilistic moment" in which conventional semantic measures are obliterated and new ref erential resources deployed. It is now possible to understand how Cohen can elaborate from de Man's work a revitalized notion of ideology. Since every material moment opens again the question of determining the sys tems of regulating semantic reference, the ideological domain is precisely that of errance, of reference itself as a policed system of bestowing value. If intrinsic to all cultural systems of reference there inheres such a material moment when the modes of interpretation are evacuated, then this sedimentation can be differently affected by touching upon such material moments. "What we call ideol</page><page sequence="8">184 REVIEW ESSAY ogy," de Man glosses in the lead essay from The Resistance to Theory, "is precisely the confusion of linguistic with natural reality, of refer ence with phenomenalism. It follows that, more than any other mode of inquiry, including economics, the linguistics of literariness is a powerful and indispensable tool in the unmasking of ideological aberrations, as well as a determining factor in accounting for their occurrence."7 Despite de Man's coy invocation of unmasking, such a conception of ideology is not at all reducible to the unveiling of errors or illusions. Just as the referential is an undeniable part of every interpretative system, so the putative phenomenalization of this aberrant reference is a necessary dimension of social existence. Indeed, culture is nothing other than the after-effect generated by such aberrations. While this "unmasking" reveals nothing except materiality - that is, nothing at all - this materiality offers a "tool" or technology for deciding anew which variety of aberrance or form of phenomenalization should occur. From this novel and much-needed rereading of de Man, Cohen retrieves several powerful concepts. The first is that behind our cur rent investment in lived experience and practical commitment lies a merely representational or mimetic conception of politics, which ignores the material basis actually decisive in installing such habits. To help displace this neutralization, he focuses on de Man's own interest in memory - specifically, the opposition of Erinnerung and Ged#chtnis in Hegel - in order to give it a decidedly Nietzschean twist. For de Man, the arena of living memory, or Erinnerung, must be conceived as an epiphenomenon to the dead exteriority of the mechanical memorization represented by Gedschtnis.8 Turning to Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals, Cohen couches his own inter ventionist strategies in what is called mnemotechnics- Nietzsche's name for that prehistory of mankind where memory was constructed through an unremitting ritual of pain. In asking the all-important question of the value of values, Nietzsche returns us to that cruelly inscriptive moment when memory, identity, and history are all in augurated through an inhuman exteriority. In Demanian terms, then, we must return to the material archive of dead memory - "inscrip tion" - in order to decide once again our lived experience, our cultural beliefs, our social lives - that is, "ideology."</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ESSAY 185 But in another sense my own recourse to de Man here is mis leading. For while one could trace Cohen's own genealogy back through de Man's work, given that all such genealogies are thoroughly motivated political gestures, this would miss what is truly striking in his relationship to de Man. As Cohen remarks at the end of his chap ter on de Man, "it remains boring or unproductive to recuperate or recirculate 'de Man,"' explaining that "interest fetishizes the story or profile of an unusual critical intelligence, since it comes at the ex pense of experimenting with or extending strangely won, still radical technologies of value" (54). After the "scandal" of de Man's wartime journalism surfaced, one of the unfortunately reactionary moves by an undoubtedly intelligent community was to claim that de Man had all along been discussing politics and nothing else. Suddenly "The Resistance to Theory," with its brief mention of ideology, became a cornerstone for reevaluating de Man's "political" thought. Yet one suspects that de Man's real contribution to politics occurred largely through his role in effecting a very practical change in humanities departments throughout the country. However, even this institutional politics is not without its ambiguities. When Cohen wonders, if de Man himself set a time bomb to disperse his own monumentalization" (32), perhaps it was not the wartime writings at all that posed a prob lem. Rather, the fetishization - indeed, the melancholic incorpora tion - of de Man has been the real snare all along. Neologistics Having hopefully provided sufficient background information to ex plain both Cohen's objections to cultural studies' "mimetic blind" and his own intervention as a materialist, it is fruitful to pause here in order to consider what sets the very language of Ideology and In scription apart from so many other recent theoretical works. In terms of tone and style, there is an undeniable inventiveness and energy that crackles in each page. Cohen's writing is virtuoso in the highest sense of the term -- performative without being coy, self-conscious of its own position, yet neither heavy-handed nor laborious. Never theless, there is throughout a decidedly manifesto-like air, a sense of energy and urging that crosses at crucial junctures into an apocalyp tic tone. Largely, this seems to originate from the political ethos of</page><page sequence="10">186 REVIEW ESSAY cultural studies itself, carrying a tone of authority that still emanates from invocations of world-historical transformation. In the still-lin gering terms of Marx's theses on Feuerbach, interpretation may be all good and well, but the point is still to change it. What is unique is the way this imperative has become accelerated under Cohen's dexter ous hand into a call for change that seems epochal, absolute, and even ominously cataclysmic. Characteristic in this regard are invoca tions of "an epoch-defining project upon which diverse virtual fu tures continue to depend" (1), a claim whose terms at once mix a sense of awesome inclusive gravity ("epoch-defining project") with a strangely indefinite gesture towards "diverse virtual futures." While he may mean "virtual" in a technical sense - recalling the aberrant nature of ideological production - the effect is to make these changes seem only a transient epiphenomenon, secondary to the more cru cial nihilistic moment. Moreover, since he concludes that both lib eral and conservative agendas have devolved into equally "mimetic" and humanistic projects, he retains the tone of revolutionary change while explicitly refusing its comfortable frame of reference. When Cohen therefore calls for "a transmutation of the epistemo-political management of reference, temporality, and the archive itself" (20) - escalating list of terms to which he will add the "altering of the terres trial itself" - the tone significantly introduces a dark sense of fore boding into the usual utopian promises. While questions of tone are as important as they are difficult to define, a few things are certain. First, Cohen's demands are, to my mind, not to be critiqued as being merely imprecise or abstract, as if he should somehow provide a short list of the world's ten most palpable evils. And, conversely, these in vocations are not to be dismissed as mere rhetorical soundbites that parodically mimic the political self-legitimization of cultural studies. In their dark tone sounds a sincerity that cannot be discounted as irony. Yet the precise status of this finely modulated pitch is highly elusive. A product of this transformational rhetoric is a persistent use of neologisms throughout. Certainly, they demonstrate that Cohen is not invested in a particular vocabulary or critical school, and so he is willing to borrow from de Man or Benjamin without retaining the terms that tie them to a specific historical moment. Neverthe</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW ESSAY 187 less, an inventiveness that is everywhere manifest in style and idea seems to insist on becoming literalized through a series of concep tual coinings. For instance, his stress on inscription becomes legible through this cluster of terms: graphematics, allographics, ideallographics, cinemallographics, the graphomorphic, and even a grand zoographics.9 Similarly the non-naturalness of identity and memory become reinforced through terms like counter-technicity (119), mnemotechnicity (119), and tele-mnemotechnics (50). At one point, the earth itself seems to become engulfed in a doubtlessly non-Euclidean geo-metrics (123), perhaps stimulated by too much indulgence in Benjamin's hashish-influenced pharmacopoetics (223). Such a will-to-neologism seems to be the stylistic counterpart to the transformational rhetoric already remarked, a kind of notation act ing as a syntactic place-holder for the new allographic regime of the post-human and extra-terrestrial.10 Again, these must be heard not as mere stylistic tics or lapses in literary propriety, but rather as the symptomatic indices of Cohen's very conscious rhetorical strat egy. There is, on the one hand, a certain deliberate seriousness be hind these novel terms, recalling the philological reactivations of a Nietzsche or the constructivist exuberance of a Bakhtin. But, on the other hand, there is also a knowing encounter with risk - the cal culated barrage of neologism teeters on the brink of becoming an array of substitutable non-terms. This seems the threat that Cohen encounters at every stage, always on the edge, creating a flexible, always elastic vocabulary that alters and endangers the very fabric of his writing." Further, such risks are not reduced by Cohen's habitual use of quotation marks to indicate a certain internal distance or ironic aside. In addition to the subtitle's "cultural studies," the short list would in clude: terrestrial "life" itself, the history of "organic" life on earth, de Man's "late" text and the "direction" he takes, Hitchcock's pretense to appear as "himself," Bakhtin getting "betrayed" or "forgotten," the mnemotechnic "event," the ideology of "experience," post-structur alist "theory," canonical "meaning," a "fascistic" order, cultural stud ies as "relapse," and even "something called 'nature.'" The structural complement to the neologisms, these self-consciously disavowed terms externally announce their untenability as clich6s, yet they also re</page><page sequence="12">188 REVIEW ESSAY mind us that there is no escaping from such semantic commodification. More crucially, their continued preservation as marked suggests that beyond their effaced surfaces slouch things only dimly remembered, intimating some obscure archaic disaster that still lingers traumati cally inside platitudes like "nature" or "experience." Finally, there is another aspect of Cohen's readings, already familiar to readers of Anti-Mimesis, that deserves comment. We have already seen how Cohen appropriates de Man's materiality and Benjamin's reine Sprache to indicate a structural desemanticization that opens up the possibility and politicization of interpretation as a cultural activity. In de Man, this is typically schematized as being somehow prior to any tropological exchange of figurative meaning or hermeneutic elaboration, leading Cohen to invoke the "pre-fig ural" or "pre-mimetic" elements of the text. However, this becomes literalized in his mannered, if virtuoso, attendance to the "material" play of sound, letters, and signatures. In his earlier reading of Melville's "Bartleby," for instance, Cohen suggests that behind the thematics of the copyist's eventual catalepsy stands the circulation of certain syllables or even letters that gives the lie to the mimetic pretense of the narrative.12 Likewise, in his reading of Hitchcock, he argues that these pre-semantic elements connote a "radical evacua tion of meaning" that may lead to "the potentially transformative import that a formal principle of linguistic difference may have as a caesura, a tool for intervening in received narratives, ideological habits, historical foreclosures" (171). Its genealogy would extend back to de Man's use of the hypogram in his reading of Riffaterre in "Hypogram and Inscription," taken up from Saussure's infamous hidden notebooks on Latin poetry. Yet part of the risk that adheres to this procedure is that it may seem both arbitrary and aporetic, lead ing to the dissolution of the thematic import into an anagrammatic circulation of interchangeable elements. The degree zero of such explication blanche resides in Hitchcock's putative "signature," the bar series first isolated by William Rothman ("1111"), which lingers like a threat to engulf each act of reading. "Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!"</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW ESSAY 189 Frenzy These stylistic notes are, nonetheless, merely symptomatic markers for a more pervasive dilemma that occupies Cohen's thinking throughout. The sinister invocations of epochal change, the neologistical perversity, the insistence upon letteral play -all these must be understood not as straight-up declarations or personal idio syncrasies but as rhetorical gestures self-consciously inscribed within a war with "cultural studies." But what precisely is "cultural stud ies"? So far we have merely defined its supposed mimetic bias, that is, its ignorance or, more pointedly, its defensive inversions designed to occlude the desemanticizing passage that grounds political dis pute. But in his more provocative moments, Cohen suggests that cultural studies has no other - no outside, no opposition, no nega tion - and therefore is, properly speaking, neither alive nor dead: ... "cultural studies," unlike almost every other critical program we have witnessed - deconstructionism, say, or new historicism, or "identity politics" as such - seems unable to die, as though exempt from cycles of domi nance and withdrawal. Instead it spreads, absorbing and assimilating styles, persisting as if without other, as if at or beyond the "end" of a received construct of (critical) history .... (103) Housed in quotation marks, "cultural studies" is thus itself only an after-effect, a back-projection or ideological deformation, charac teristic of what Cohen understands as ideology. Alluding to Slavoj Ziiek's discussion of "ideological anamorphosis," Cohen also re gards "ideology" as a deforming after-effect of a material event (the "inscription" of the title). This would include, for example, the long hermeneutic traditions of platonism that systematically invert Plato's text, or the auteural interpretations grown around Hitchcock's oeuvre. Cohen identifies a similar pattern in de Man's pairing of Kant and Schiller. Where Kant names a material event, the name Schiller la bels a relapse to a badly-geared tropological system whose privileg ing of the practical falls into sheer idealism. Therefore, what powers the unnatural efflorescence called "cultural studies" is, according to Cohen, precisely its status as "an archive of that present" which it</page><page sequence="14">190 REVIEW ESSAY "defers and fetishizes . . . like a corpse" (104). Such effects are a necessity, as systematic, inexorable, and predictable as referentiality itself, and so an impossible enemy to beat.13 Therefore, the war with cultural studies is not so straightforward as it might appear. While it would seem an impossibly easy target to hit, it is an opponent that slowly absorbs its enemies through their very blows, manufacturing a gooey entanglement. This explains, in part, why Cohen refrains from explicit polemics of the type he denounces with regard to de Man - they would only miss their target, reinscribing themselves in debates that expired decades ago. In fact, the very polemic be comes transformed, since it is not simply a question of beating up some theoretical position, called "cultural studies," but a matter of understanding a cultural and institutional effect that passes using that guise. I would like to suggest that in two separate moments this problem becomes overtly thematized. The first concerns Cohen's reading of Hitchcock's film Sabotage and the uncertain status of that revolutionary act. The second emerges in his polemics with Zizek, especially the Lacanian's duplicitous and double deployment of the real. What each of these moments show, I would argue, is that "cultural studies" is a moment internal to the very problematic of materiality and ideology, a moment that is therefore neither an external enemy to be disparaged, nor an internal temptation to be avoided, but an inexorable structural risk that changes the nature of polemics. As a revision of Conrad's Secret Agent, Hitchcock's film is ex plicitly concerned with the possibility of sabotage. At first blush, the film has a curious attitude towards subversion. On the one hand, it is all about the attempts of Verloc to terrorize London, first with a blackout and later with a bomb delivered to Picadilly Circus; yet on the other hand, it seems more interested in failure than success. First, there is the explicit failure of Verloc's attempt to scare the Lon doners -- they laugh at the blackout and the bomb only succeeds in blowing up his idiot son Stevie - and second, there is the stylis tic failure of the film itself, replete with wooden acting, unconvinc ing love stories, and Hitchcock's own glee at Stevie's mistaken detonation. But for Cohen, these themes only hide the truly subver sive moments in the film. Behind the overt themes circulate trans</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW ESSAY 191 formative signature-effects, non-thematic elements that he catalogs as "overt signs and repeated gestures, paronomasia extending across different films, visual and aural or letteral 'puns' that serve as relays, nameplay" (170), all culminating in Hitchcock's own signature bar series. Against the mimetic sheen of cinematic reproduction and the entire apparatus of film theory (the auteurist, subjectivist, and ocular-centric interpretations of "the gaze"), Hitchcock offers an evacuation of representational meanings second to none. The Hitchcock signature "signifies nothing - retains no linguistic con tent, precedes all punning networks" and therefore "stands to dis solve not only narrative but all mimetic projections of representation, including face itself" (172). Linking such intrusive pre-mimetic ele ments to Benjamin's reine Sprache and de Man's "materiality" as sites of a nihilistic desemanticization, such incisions are then meant not to substitute a new mode of meaning (puns, say, rather than emotional melodrama), but rather to close out the pretense of signi fication altogether. Yet the laugher continues. The fact that London responds to the blackout with laughter does not exactly trouble this reading, but indi cates Cohen's own awareness of the undeniable pull exercised by this performance and theorization of failure. It is not thatVerloc needs bigger bombs or better smarts to make the metropolis stand up and take notice; it is that this failure seems somehow more terrible than any terrorist act might ever prove. Both the blackout and the time bomb become signs of a ruined revolutionary act, analogous to the deforming after-images that congeal around all traumatic intrusions. Just as de Man insists that reference will aberrantly occur as a mode of relapse - every Kant will draw some Schiller upon himself, every Dionysus must be veiled by an Apollonian appearance - so too does Cohen see the metaphorical blackout of signification relapse into laughter: "Coming out of the Underground, after all, the Londoners are laughing" (186). Caught in a ghastly limbo that recalls his defini tion of cultural studies, he continues, "One cannot quite kill what is already technically 'dead,' already the product of material signs or representation, emerging in its after-life" (186). Problematically, then, the representational patina that Hitchcock purports to sabotage is actually an effect of that very disruption. If, as Cohen asserts, "'con</page><page sequence="16">192 REVIEW ESSAY sciousness' or 'life' are co-effects of semiosis or (cinematic) writing," then these are products not to be postponed, let alone blown up, try as one might. Therefore, we fall beneath a barrage of negativity as we are told that Hitchcock "cuts off" any natural or iconic relation to meaning, the blackout corresponds to "this momentary loss of as sured reference," and the signature-effects have "curtailed" any natu ral logic of origination . Yet always we encounter a disappointing rejuvenation: "As a sheer and citational semiosis, this cinema would cut off the mimetic reference which film above all mediums begins by seductively invoking, or promising, or would, if the mimetic refer ent itself were not generated by this semiosis instead" (186-7). Or would: We appear lodged in a "double-chase," where the very thing Cohen wants to "cut off" - the mimetic referent, mascot of "cultural studies" as such - is all along already the product of this very pre tense to evacuation. As an allegory of his entire transformative project, Cohen of fers the following condensation of the problem: While on the one hand it attempts to name the prospect of an "act" that Hitchcockian writing would effect, one parallel to a subversion of an aesthetico-political order that is mock apocalyptic, it cannot locate that event as a discrete intervention, a moment that can be isolated, but only across a general catastrophic field that the present is already an after-effect to, humans another effect of a grand zoographics. (189) In this quotation, we can isolate several of the stylistic strands we noted before, but now they can be located within a more signifi cant theoretical problematic. We have Cohen's own identification of his project with a "mock apocalyptic" event that cannot locate an identifiable opponent or coalesce into a single moment and so quivers between the unsuccessful "act" from the past and the ne ologistic zoographics of the future. But all these quirks - scare quotes, neologism, apocalyptic tone - bear witness to the main dilemma: discovering that the interventionist project cannot shuttle from past to future because it is only "another effect" of an already sabotaged field.</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW ESSAY 193 This problem receives its second allegorization in Cohen's prior chapter on 2iiek. Elsewhere in the book, Cohen usefully compares Ziiek's version of late Lacan to his own interpretation of late de Man, using the Slovenian to highlight how both theorists came increas ingly to value a non-symbolizable, asemantic kernel (alternately "the real" or "materiality"). Since ideology emerges as an after-effect that dissimulates this dispossessing core, one must remove the "sublime object of ideology" from its fantasy frame and thereby expose it as a disgusting protuberance. Like de Man's materiality, the real is only a zone through which intervention moves, a space where ideological formations can be dissolved without the pretense to any revelation of "the truth." However, as Cohen incisively notes, the real has a double relationship to the symbolic. While the real is usually heralded as dissolving the symbolic encrustations of social fantasy, we are also frequently reminded that the symbolic is itself only an after-effect produced by the real. Therefore, the real that seemed to dissolve the symbolic universe was actually all along the point of origin that con structed the symbolic as its gentrification. Time and again, we dis cover that a putative supersession has only been the precondition for the very thing we were seeking to overcome. This double-talk at the heart of the symbolic - victim and gentrification of the real - can be linked to an entire system of oppositions in Zizek's writing. Cohen takes the relationship between the crusty old Enlightenment subject and the refurbished new Lacanian one as an example: "The reader may think that the Lacanian subject (as the second term) involved a negation of the Enlighten ment subject (first term), but this is a false narrative, since the former really precedes and constituted the latter in its forgetfulness" (152). An entire set of terms obey this logic: modernism and postmodern ism, post-structuralism and Lacan, middle Lacan and late Lacan, symptom and sinthom, desire and drive, fantasy and traversing the fantasy, pleasure principle and death drive. In a Lacanian language, we might say that traversing the fantasy appears to dissolve the co ordinates of desire that structure our social reality, yet this fantasy only has efficacy through its ability to offer refuge from the devasta tions of the real. Fantasy has no power of its own to beguile or mystify us. That is why Zizek insists that Althusser's theory of inter</page><page sequence="18">194 REVIEW ESSAY pellation must be supplemented by a realization that it always fails - what traps us in our ideological selves is less the invariable suc cess of the ideological state apparatuses and more their offer of sanc tuary from the psychotic anxiety of the traumatic jouissance.14 The real is less an intervention than a bogey-man that keeps the sym bolic well supplied with marks. Returning to the reading of Hitchcock, we can immediately note the uncanny resemblance between Zizek and Cohen. Just as Ziiek must construct a "false narrative" in order to dissimulate the superimposed dual relations of the symbolic and real, so too must Cohen constantly invoke an epochal shift that has already surrepti tiously generated the very ideological clusters that it seeks to trans form. Cohen's version of Ziiek's double-talk is called the "double-chase," which he glosses as "proleptically pursuing the specter of an event that is nonetheless the precondition of that pur suit" (189). For both Cohen and Zizek, this Mobius strip is main tained by a forgetfulness: Cohen traces Ziiek's real as it "precedes and constituted the latter [the symbolic] in its forgetfulness" (152), while he himself describes the Londoners' laughter as it "absorbs the project of sabotaging narrative time by the latter's necessary for getfulness of that being accomplished before the fact" (199-200). This climaxes in what appears to be the true reason for the encoun ter with Zizek - that the transformational rhetoric so dear to cul tural studies as well as to seemingly hostile enterprises like Zizek's must equally face a structural dilemma. The act of critiquing Zizek provides a wry allegory for an inevitable time bomb - the time between inscription and ideology, the symbolic and the real -which threatens to collapse duplicity. Indeed, one feels that part of Cohen's impatience with Zizek stems from that writer's mock-revelatory pre tense in showing that "all along" the symbolic was already a re sponse to the real. The effect is to eviscerate the relationship of the two until they become Janus-faced alter-egos of one another, the vampire all along the real Enlightenment subject, the monster all along the Cartesian cogito.'5 Such mechanical success forgets the very real failures of Verloc's inverted terrorism - a terrorism not of the state but of the Potemkin family. What time bomb does not lead to what Cohen calls, punning on the Hitchcock film, a state of</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW ESSAY 195 "frenzy"? This is "the 'frenzy'," he explains, "of trying to exceed a system that is oppositionally and specularly inscribed, in a circular logic" (189). Yet, given that this film concerns a serial killer who strangles women with neckties, we must not jump to the conclu sion that such a knot is without its own peculiar purpose. Double-Talk Just as Cohen's dilemma becomes allegorized in his reading of Hitchcock and Zizek, so too does he offer another allegorization of his own confrontation with cultural studies. Yet, while the examples of Hitchcock and Zizek only gave form to this conundrum, this allegorization, I believe, suggests how Cohen's own writing deals with this frenzy. It assumes an appropriately hybrid form - a read ing of Bakhtin, to be sure, but as read through the lens of de Man's short essay "Dialogue and Dialogism." Just as Cohen will have to face a duplicitous, because never alive, "cultural studies," so too will de Man have to face an equally duplicitous Bakhtin. Without engaging in the subtleties of the lengthy analysis, I want to note that what makes de Man's encounter so extraordinary is a series of rhe torical feints towards his nemesis Bakhtin. Before moving into Cohen's interpretation, let us turn to de Man's essay. De Man first ironically assumes his role as "deconstructive" foil to the "cultural studies" icon of dialogue, Mikhail Bakhtin. Yet before starting his own dialogue with Bakhtin, de Man suggests that "dialogue" should be heard not as a "conversation with many voices" but as a persecuted "double-talk" that must dissimulate its actual intentions beneath an ironic array of rhetorical traps ("contradic tions, pseudonyms, inexact repetitions of earlier statements, strange expressions" - terms whose immediate applicability to Bakhtin should be obvious).16 After making this alarming suggestion, he then immediately retracts this statement - and the implication that in deed Bakhtin is far more deconstructive and Demanian than his "official" reputation would allow - in order to investigate whether "dialogism" as a formal, literary genre permits movement into a true, social milieu of otherness as suggested by "dialogue." Unfor tunately, de Man laments, Bakhtin not only does not provide this desired contact with alterity but in the attempt mires us in a precriti</page><page sequence="20">196 REVIEW ESSAY cal phenomenalism in which "there is no room for exotopy, for oth erness, in any shape or degree."17 Dialogue in Bakhtin becomes an oddly failed term, delivering not the hermeneutic communication it promises but initiating what de Man quietly calls "a dialogical im perialism." If dialogue fails, then, as a vehicle for achieving true communication, it appears to achieve a more disreputable success as colonizer. As if this weren't bad enough, it next gets supplanted by dialogue as "a battle of wits" where author and reader "try to outdo each other, parrying, feinting, and setting traps" or, more cun ningly, as a seduction, solicitation, and humiliation.18 De Man's own gesture of refusing to attack or re-interpret Bakhtin (as "double-talk," seductively defacing) acknowledges that Bakhtin has always been occupied with violent scenes of power, usurpation, and disfigure ment that were veiled beneath the pretense of "dialogue." In one sense, battling Bakhtin or his official interpretation would be step ping into the trap, and de Man's withdrawal displays the true power accruing to his opponent's system. But in a more radical sense, de Man allows us to continue with our avuncular "Bakhtin" because there is no reason to beat him - Bakhtin is the more Demanian of the two, and de Man's own admitted defeat only ushers us more assuredly into the Russian's dooming embrace. For Cohen, this missed encounter between de Man and Bakhtin pivots around two different polemical strategies: dialogic imperial ism and double-talk. At first, dialogic imperialism seems to recall the agonistic Oedipal struggles already familiar from Harold Bloom's theory of the anxiety of influence. Rather than the peaceful exchange of ideas, de Man finds in dialogue a "wildly agonistic scene of power, positioning, deception, seduction, and defacement," where all ex change implies a battle for independence that strives to efface its own belated acts of imitation by violently deforming its predecessors. Yet Cohen sees de Man moving beyond this overtly Oedipal struggle into the more treacherous dissimulations of Nietzschean ressentiment. Rather than a Melian dialogue where the strong openly bully the weak, we find Dostoevsky's Underground Man, eaten away with a bitter rancor that at times seems self-inflicted. Beyond mere power-plays, then, is a self-conscious loop that accelerates and complicates this struggle for mastery. According to Cohen, the Bakhtinian "word" is</page><page sequence="21">REVIEW ESSAY 197 depicted as "anticipating in the other's word an anticipation of one's own (anticipation), with the intent of overpowering and incorporat ing the counter-reading of an always verbal other" (67). Not only does each word dialogically inflect a previous word - as Wordsworth might distort Milton - but since this is the sole means of securing significance, the prior word has already anticipated this later parasit ism and taken precautions. Moreover, even the parasite may become, in turn, host to new parasites, so that each anticipation must take into account its own later cannibalization. Dialogic imperialism can then assume two distinct forms. The first is nothing but ressentiment pure and simple, not so much the ability of the weak to overcome the strong as the ability to survive as weak, to incorporate itself as a parasite. As commentator Michael Bernstein has argued, the concept of mutual citation found in Bakhtin uncomfortably connects the very idea of dialogue with Nietzschean ressentiment. Cohen in fact quotes Bernstein to this effect: "What Bakhtin understands by the 'dialogic imagination' is uncomfortably similar to Nietzsche's account of the slave's reactive, dependent, and fettered consciousness. Every word the Nietzschean slave utters, ev ery value he posits, is purely reactive, impregnated by the words and values of others and formulated entirely in response to and as an anticipation of the responses he will elicit."19 The counter-strategy is precisely to mime failure, to offer up for the other's consumption a thin gruel of ruin so as to starve the parasite from its host's body. Since parasitism is a given, the only mode of containment is to offer a faux victim for the enemy to inhabit; then, when the feast begins, to ruin both corpse and cannibal in a single suiciding. In addition to dialogic imperialism, de Man suggests a second strategy through his translation of dialogue as "double-talk." Bor rowed in part from Leo Strauss's book on persecuted speech, this version of unreliable, ironized speech still informs de Man's discus sion when he surmises that there is something rotten at the heart of Bakhtin's enterprise. What else but double-talk can be heard in de Man's conclusion that Bakhtin's ideas of dialogue are first a reification (object versus society) and second a descent into "precritical phe nomenology"? What at first seems like a critique of Bakhtin rather suggests that this "accidental" evisceration of otherness "in any shape</page><page sequence="22">198 REVIEW ESSAY or degree" is a calculated strategy of putting the squeeze to alterity - offering the kindly vehicle of "dialogue" replete with gleaming lures of genuine otherness, only to then discover that it is something of a death-trap. Cohen therefore calls Bakhtinian dialogue "an in tentionally ruined figure," theory and example of a tropological sui cide-bombing. If this appears to redouble one of the tactics assumed in his dialogic imperialism, this is precisely the point. Once the "battle of wits" is folded into itself, it produces such self-destructive moments as a response to parasitic incorporation. Moreover, Cohen locates two types of dialogical non-terms in Bakhtin. The first he calls "paleonyms": words like sign and ideol ogy that seem more than official, suspiciously obsolete and super annuated, already retired from semantic duty, yet still circulated in full consciousness of their creaking senescence (80, 86). Cohen sees Bakhtin as effecting "a covert yet systematic Nietzschean reversal of received valorizations in undermining the too familiar concepts he empties and recirculates (sign, dialogue, value, ideology, genre), terms that negatively and anamorphically trope their 'official' or philosophic meanings by moving 'in between' and undoing the bi naries that upheld the terms themselves" (69-70). But the second set of terms offers no better help. These he calls "clunky neologisms": words like chronotope and heteroglossia that pretend to offer more modern updates to herald us into the shining future, yet always dis appoint (80). Inside of every neologism, then, lies a "precritical phe nomenalism" waiting to get out. For example, settling momentarily on the essay on chronotopes, Cohen notes that there "Bakhtin at tempts, and fails, to cross beyond this site - by imposing a differ ential typology on types of 'carnival' and presenting them as a serial or narrative (literary) history leading to a 'metamorphosis' as if be yond Bakhtin's own text" (90). Yet "carnival" is less "a figure burst ing with life and the rule of immediacy," Cohen adds, than "a formalistic or faux mimetic trope that, difficult to leave, in the end evades the transvaluation Voloshinov's text began with" (90). This should help make clearer what I earlier termed the risks that Cohen's intervention within cultural studies necessarily encoun tered. As the highly complex and involuted descriptions of Bakhtin and de Man should make clear, polemics cannot be reduced to</page><page sequence="23">REVIEW ESSAY 199 some intellectual encounter between opponents, even less "theory" and "cultural studies." However, if such oppositions are less than useful in today's debates, it cannot be concluded that this stems from the success of cultural studies in either assimilating theory as a methodological tool or securing the transformational goals it has erected. If, indeed, Cohen's prognosis of a historical blockage or critical impasse holds relevancy for current debates, and if certain revelations regarding social construction or the contingency of agency no longer contain quite the impact that they once delivered, then cultural studies at least must be thanked for offering us a frag mented and disabused horizon in which to explore alternative pos sibilities. Furthermore, if the genuine power of cultural studies is no longer to be contained within a superficial institutional history of succession and inheritance (from "abstract theory" to "engaged politics," from "de Man" to "Bakhtin"), then Cohen provides us with an acute and too-often misunderstood assessment of its true place - not as a set of institutional self-legitimations, nor as a fetishization of contemporary culture, but as an effect of a more pressing pre dicament in the very relationship between culture and its compul sive identifications.</page><page sequence="24">200 REVIEW ESSAY 1 This analysis is offered in the opening section of the third chapter, "Mnemotechnics: time of the seance, or the mimetic blind of 'cultural stud ies"' (especially 98-104).

After all, he asks, isn't every "parody" perhaps "a citational component of linguistic experimentation" and therefore present in every act of genuine creativity? This, of course, is not intended to redeem Sokal's essay but rather to capture the dangerous but necessary obscurity that gathers together jargon and creativity, if not authenticity. 12 As Cohen warns: "We may have to reread Melville's narrative idea, accord ingly, not as being characters or subjects, but at certain points as emerging in the form of words or, in fact, non-words like 'co(n)-,' 'mer-,' 'ba(r)-,' '-in(g),' and so on, rather than the familiar grand themes" (Anti-Mimesis from Plato to Hitchcock [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 19941, 169).</page><page sequence="25">REVIEW ESSAY 201 13 In another idiom - made recently legible as Wendy Brown's "wounded at tachments" and Mark Seltzer's "pathological public sphere" but only suggested by Cohen through occasional allusions to Nietzsche - cultural studies ap pears to be an avatar of ressentiment, that turning back of cruelty which hol lows out the enclave of "bad conscience" and so grows stronger through every injury, more resilient after each slur, battening on the moor of insult. For an analysis that Cohen does not explicitly pursue, see Brown's "Wounded Attach ments" in States of Injury (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995) and Seltzer's Serial Killers (New York: Routledge, 1998). 14 As Zizek writes: "Althusser speaks only of the process of ideological interpel lation through which the symbolic machine of ideology is 'internalized' into the ideological experience of Meaning and Truth: but we can learn from Pascal that this 'internalization,' by structural necessity, never fully succeeds, that there is always a residue, a leftover, a stain of traumatic irrationality and sense lessness sticking to it, and that this leftover, far from hindering the full submis sion of the subject to the ideological command, is the very condition of it it is precisely this non-integrated surplus of senseless traumatism which confers on the Law its unconditional authority." See The Sublime Object of Ideology (Lon don: Verso, 1989), 43. Obviously when Ziiek lapses into italics, he is showing how the symbolic (here "ideological interpellation") is itself a deforming re sponse to the putative "traumatism" of the real. 15 Part of this identification between symbolic and real is to be explained by the, fact that the symbolic is not merely an escape or gentrification of the real but itself an embodiment that immediately "short-circuits" the two. As Ziiek writes in this vein: "the pure 'subject of the Enlightenment' is a monster which gives body to the surplus that escapes the vicious circle of the mirror relationship." Such a "gives body" is the less technical way of explaining the Lacanian matheme for the structure of fantasy: "what we have here is not the relation ship of two entities [the split subject and the objet a] but rather the two sides, the two 'slopes,' of one and the same entity. The subject is 'the same' as the Thing, he is so to speak its negative (the trace of its absence) within the sym bolic network." See Enjoy Your Symptom! (New York: Routledge, 1992), 136 7. Within such a system it is increasingly difficult to discern a transformative possibility, an impasse certainly witnessed by the unfortunate redundancy of Zizek's theoretical output, with his own writing circularly entrapped within a sort of M6bius band. 16 Paul de Man, "Dialogue and Dialogism," The Resistance to Theory, 107. 17 Ibid., 111. 18 Ibid., 112. 19 Cohen, 65; the citation from Bernstein is taken from "The Poetics of Ressentiment," in Rethinking Bakhtin, eds.
