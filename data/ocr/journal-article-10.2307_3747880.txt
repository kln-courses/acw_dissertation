<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER JOSHUA C. GREGORY A YOUNG boy found one of Beck's best stereoscopes, but he did not understand its use. When he looked through the two eye-pieces at the two adjacent duplicates (nearly) of each picture on each card he got a single flat picture, and he expected nothing more. Then the moment of revelation came. As he fumbled the focus onto a flat picture of Hamlet, the grave-diggers and Hamlet himself bulged out, the skull on Hamlet's palm looked like a museum piece, and the grave yawned like a real pit. The stereoscopic world of the Beck instrument had been suddenly established in the boy's experience. The real perceptual world, where swallows fly and daisies grow, is not frozen like its stereoscopic mimic, where men look like waxworks and waters look like glass. It is not as suddenly established in experi- ence as its stereoscopic counterfeit, but cumulative experience does establish it in each human being. This established perceptual world, cumulatively wrought, or organized, out of experiences into experience, includes what Walter de la Mare once disrespectfully called "dressed-up mammalia." Experience grows rather than constructs this established perceptual world, with its crowd of human beings, in each human mind, though the artificer analogy is often convenient. Neither the world of material things nor of plants nor of animals nor of men is explicitly reasoned into existence. The experient does not deliberately infer the existence of other people to explain experiences otherwise per- plexing. He accepts their existance because his cumulative experience establishes it in him, together with his whole perceptual world. Then this great company of "fellow humans" who "possess souls, not always conspicuous, and minds, not invariably attractive, and tongues, at times tedious," troubles philosophers and perplexes logicians. They are troubled because "merely inferred friends" seem to be such logical travesties of real ones, and yet, since their bodies are directly accessible to eye, finger, or ear, while their "souls" or "minds" are not directly known, their most significant part does seem to be inferred. When Jack and Jill link arms and look at the full silver moon, Jack has his seeing, Jill has hers, and neither experi- ences the seeing of the other. If Jill thinks of "Diana's foresters . .. minions of the moon," Jack knows nothing of it unless Jill tells him, and even then he only thinks his own thinking and infers, however unwitting his inference, the thinking of Jill. This principle 244</page><page sequence="2">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER runs through all Jack's experience of Jill, or hers of him. Each is certain of the other's seeing, but each has a private seeing which is not public to the other, though the moon itself seems public enough to be seen by anyone. The worried philosopher or logician notes Jack's power to feel his own pain when he is pricked, his inability to feel Jill's pain when a pin pricks her, his analogous powers and inabilities throughout countless experiences, and his absolute confidence in Jill's likeness to himself as a human being in spite of his inabilities. The logical plight of the firm believer in the existence of other people like himself has received a special terminological description. He can introspect his own experiences, he cannot extrospect those of others, yet he believes as firmly in what he cannot extrospect as in what he can introspect. Jack cannot know Jill's feelings or thoughts directly as he does realize directly the tuck of her arm in his. He seems to infer the most important part of her, she of him, and any two persons seem to be in the same logical plight. If the existence of other people fundamentally like one's self is thus inferred, then it seems certain and is actually only probable, which is logically distressing even if the probability is high. The logical plight does not trouble common sense because ordinary experience is blind to the fact that it does infer much of its friends. The insistent logician who exposes the inferences must, however, be humoured, and the philosopher's demand for justification of the inveterate belief in the existence of other people must be heeded and, if possible, met. The logical discomfort goes if the alleged inference is falsely presumed. One man can see another jump, or he can hold the other's hand or hear him speak. If a human being does, in fact, detect another's pain or thought or purpose or any other apparently non- extrospectible item as directly as he can watch jumps or feel hands or hear words, he does not infer the minds of his fellows any more than he infers their bodies. We might, conceivably, know one another in this direct way without being aware of the fact. Immediate intuitions of apparently non-extrospectible items might be diffused imperceptibly through our experiences of one another, or such intuitions might be numerous enough to assure belief in one another's existence. Philosophers have tried to remove the logical discomfort by diagnosing various forms of such intuitive insights in our experi- ence of one another. Telepathy is a tempting model for these pre- sumed intuitions. The removal of any intrinsic difficulties in such telepathically conceived intuitions or in any other forms of presumed insights does not, however, remove the logical discomfort. Since we seem not to have the alleged direct intuitive knowledge, it is, in any case, presumed. If we have to infer that we do not infer our friends, then the logical discomfort and the fundamental problem remain. 245</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY Our knowledge of one another has been traditionally assessed as analogical. This dispensed with the intuitional attempt to infer away the distressing inferences. The discard still seems to be en- joined on any attempt either to justify our firm belief in the existence of many human beings, or, at least, to take the sting out of any logical discomfort over inferred friends. An insurance agent in his office greets his client, Mr. Smith, and arranges an insurance policy for him. The sense of man's mortality suffuses either mind without any conscious explicit realization of the logician's pet proposition, "All men are mortal." The agent could think in the sense of this proposition if he had never glanced at a primer of logic or consciously formulated the statement. He also accepts his client as a man in the same automatic unconscious way. The prospective death of the client will probably be con- sciously entertained at some point, or points, of the interview, but not as an explicitly logical deduction. The agent's organized past experience and his experience of the moment blend, or grow together, into a diffused, virtually unconscious, sense of Smith's mortality. The presumed future death of Smith is in effect an inference, for he is not yet dead, and his death cannot be directly known. The inference does not trouble the agent-John Smith will die. The analytical scheme of logic embodies the diffused sense of human mortality in the explicit proposition, "all men are mortal," the automatic acceptance of John Smith's humanity in "John Smith is a man," and the virtual inference of his mortality in "John Smith will die." The syllogism composed by the three propositions has been accused of a petitio principii, of assuming "John Smith will die" to be an inference, though it is actually included in the major premiss, "all men are mortal." Logical analysis might conceal the inference actually made by the thinking mind. There might be no inference if "all man are mortal" is an inventory, for John Smith would be included in it. The insurance agent's sense of human mortality cannot possibly include the full list of human deaths, and is not an inventory, Modern logic usually handles the major premiss as "If X is a man, X is mortal." This merely connects being a man with being mortal, specifies no particular man and, since it is not an inventory, does not misrepresent the agent's inference about Smith as an item picked from a list. The logical validity of the syllogistic deduction is absolute, for John Smith must be mortal if every man is mortal and if he is a man. Such logical validity is easily obtained: "If X is a man, X has red hair," in conjunction with "John Smith is a man," validly gives Smith red hair. The logician's pet syllogism about man and mortality is both logically valid and empirically acceptable because men are mortal, though only some are red- 246</page><page sequence="4">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER haired. This is, presumably, why it is a pet syllogism, for relatively few empirical statements have the absolutely convincing universality of "all men are mortal." To demand a logically valid proof for the existence of other people is to cry for the moon. Even the convincing "all men are mortal" cannot meet this demand. The logical assessment of the belief in other people, as of the belief in their mortality, may be an inadequate analysis of the actual experiencing situation. It may, however, be possible to assess the situation effectively enough to alleviate, if not to remove, any logical distress over "merely inferred friends" and their logical status as probabilities. Their logical status will probably have to be one of probability if it cannot be one of logically valid deduction. If logical validity is so often secured by restricting empirical warrant, widely organized empirical certainties, such as the mortality or existence of men, may exclude logical validities. Anaximenes saw the air waft a thin well-spread leaf, and con- ceived the broad earth as a table, or lamina, resting on the air. His successors, with more analogical success, saw shadows cast on earth, and explained the lunar eclipse as a shadow cast by the earth on the moon. Maine calls analogy "the most valuable of instruments in the maturity of jurisprudence" and "the most dangerous of snares in its infancy." Carveth Read notes the seduction of primitive minds into error by analogies. The floating leaf seems to us to have seduced Anaximenes very easily into presuming a lamina-like air-borne earth. The wildness of many early analogies seems to have seduced Carveth Read himself into accusing "analogical thought" of being "imaginative only," and into confining it to "metaphors and similes." Maine, more soberly, recognises the value of analogy for experienced and circumspect thought. Early analogies were, on occasion, helpful: shadows on earth led early astronomy to shadows genuinely cast on the eclipsed moon. In all domains the analogy either leads or misleads, and as thought matures it applies circum- spect checks to analogical suggestions. Analogy, indeed, is a staff, perhaps the staff, of the mind. Read notes how prone men are to rely on analogical reasoning. Descartes puts this proneness well into the mind: a noticed similarity between two things incites presumptions of unnoticed similarities. Sydney Smith puts the analogical inveteracy deeply in: we can hardly help likening anything we see to something previously seen or conceived. The inveterate habit of comparison manifests in the vogue of the metaphor, which illustrates, and of the analogy, which convicts- as Coleridge contrasts the two. In "Moby-Dick" a harpoon, which had pierced an escaped whale near the tail and was found in the hump years after when the animal was finally killed, is compared to a restless needle moving in the body of a man. This metaphor 247</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY has a bit of analogy in it, for one can argue from the behaviour of the needle to the travel of the harpoon. This, like Paley's familiar comparison of a contrived universe to a constructed watch, recog- nisably marks the inveterately analogical habit which lies so deep in mental working. A historical survey of human thought and an analysis of human thinking reveal analogies, even misleading analogies, as the stepping-stones of the mind. If analogy is the route of discovery, as Lotze suggests, this logical form conforms more closely than other such forms to the actual process of the mind. The insurance agent's actual thinking is prob- ably much more like an analogy than a syllogism. If the analogy is not a ground of proof, as Lotze also says, the logician naturally enough gives it the cold shoulder, which he seems to be doing. Probably no logical form, which is necessarily abstract and analytical, can adequately render the full synthetic concreteness of mental process, but the analogy seems to come closest to it of all logical forms. The analogical assessment of the belief in the existence of other people does, in one respect at least, come nearest to its actual establishment in the mind. A human being experiences his own experiences, he does not experience the experiences of others. If the experiencer credits other people with pains, pleasures, sensations, perceptions of objects or any other non-extrospectible items, and if he does not detect these credited experiences directly in their accredited owners, as he detects them directly in himself, or as he detects the perceptible behaviour of others directly, he must analogically extend his own introspectible experiences to other people. Analogy, as Hume says, transfers experiences in past instances to resembling objects. The believer in other people credits their bodies and behaviour with, for them, introspectible experiences similar to those connected with his own behaving body. Like bodies and similar behaviour suggest comparable introspectible experiences. This analogical reference, whatever the difficulties in detail, must occur if the introspectible experiences of others cannot be directly or intuitively detected. These private introspectible experiences are clearly inferred, remain inferred, and their logical status is one of inference and associated probability. When the Pythagoreans correlated musical notes, string-lengths and numbers, they extended these relations analogically to the harmony of the spheres. The push of the inveterately analogical habit is evident in such precipitate analogical extensions. Maine notes early interdictions on some food, for sanitary reasons, exten- sions of the prohibition to all food resembling it, and, on occasion, fanciful attribution of resemblance. The history of thought is full of free analogical extensions. History also reveals a constant route 248</page><page sequence="6">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER of the human mind through discarded or corrected and re-corrected analogies. The same push and the same correction of extravagances are evident in the analogical extension of privately introspectible experiences. The stars and planets are created gods in the Timaeus; the Athenian Stranger in Plato's Laws claims divinity for the sun, moon and stars; for Aristotle the stars are divinely intelligent, and the divinity of the celestial bodies, as gods or godlike, persisted from Babylonian or Egyptian lore through the Greco-Roman tradition far into the Christian era. This acme of personifying objects very physically unlike men discloses the power of the push behind the analogical extension of privately introspectible experiences. The early Greek mind constantly mingled the purposive into the causal, for the human mind inveterately reads its own characteristics into phenomena. Humanized animals have received the anthropomorphic attribution more plausibly than stars. The fable still appeals, though the animal actor who behaves like a man is now discredited as a fact. Personification, which has pervaded poetry, rhetoric and speech, still flourishes. Science has even been accused of clinging to a personified nature. Personificatory speech does attest the analogical habit of projecting human qualities very freely, though the accusation of actual belief in a personified nature is rash. The free analogical extension of privately introspectible qualities has been severely corrected and largely, at least, confined to human beings. The dog is credited with a modest share of human experiences, but no animal is now seriously regarded as a differently shaped or embodied human being. The belief in other people is the final and impregnable strong- hold of the personificatory habit. Men obviously do project their private experiences, and this projection, which secures the firm belief in other people, has manifested the usual extravagances of all vigorously prompted analogical extensions, and many personifi- cations still please where they do not convince. The child is usually said to recognize other people before it recog- nizes its own self. This would be strange if it deliberately argued from its own sensations or other introspectible experiences to their existence in others. We believe in the experiences of others because we have them ourselves, but not because we explicitly argue by analogy. Things happen as if we do analogically argue from the experiences connected with our own behaving bodies to similar experiences similarly connected with similarly behaving bodies. This is more the abstract logic of it than the actual occurrence. Our own experiences are involved in a complex organization of experience that results in the realisation of ourselves and others. The child's experiences can enable it to realize other people without realizing its own self. Its knowledge either of others or itself, in any case, is defective at first and ripens with the years. 249</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY Since the external world steadily enforces itself on consciousness (and on the organized unconscious mind) from the first, other people, as bits of it, naturally do so also. Solipsism is a sophisticated version of experience, introduced after the primary preoccupation with the external world, and thriving, when it does thrive, on the enigmas in the establishment of the perceptual world in experience. The growth of experience is fundamentally enigmatical, though it obviously does establish in us the consciousness of the perceptual world with its other people. The child's notion of other people probably begins with specially responsive bits of external reality, and until its experience has sufficiently matured it is natural enough for it to appreciate other people rather than itself. It is not necessary to settle here whether the child realizes other people as selves before it realizes its own self. The analogy, my behaving body is connected with certain experiences, therefore similarly behaving bodies are connected with similar experiences, comes close to the actual fact that the experiencer does believe in others because of his own experi- ences, but inferences drawn from the presumption that he does thus argue analogically, at least in an explicit way, may err, and err greatly. The analogical extension is equivalent to supposing other people to behave as if they have introspectible experiences similar to those of any individual experient. Other people must behave as the hypothesis that they actually are other people requires, even if direct, or extrospectible, knowledge of their relevant experiences does occur. The others, of course, are no more deliberately argued into existence by the as if, or hypothetical, method than by the more purely analogical. In both cases organized experience estab- lishes the belief and a logical analysis assesses it. The logical dis- tress over inferred friends may be eased if they continuously behave like the other people they are supposed to be. The other people then become logically a hypothesis, and empirically an assurance because they so continuously and diversely verify the hypothesis by their behaviour. Grass is green, thorns pierce, and ice chills: these and innumerable other perceptual assents verify for each human being the existence of others like himself. Colour-blindness disturbs the sense of simi- larity among men without maiming it. The vagaries of para-ethoxy- phenyl-thio-carbamide, which is bitter in some mouths and tasteless in others, also disturbs and does not destroy the sense. The confidence in verificatory perceptual assents can be more seriously shaken, for it is notoriously impossible to demonstrate that any two people have exactly similar sensory experiences. If A and B have inter- changed experiences of red and green, the colour of a boiled lobster being for B what the colour of the grass is for A, and the colour of 250</page><page sequence="8">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER the boiled lobster being for A what the colour of the grass is for B, then B will consistently call a boiled lobster or a ripe tomato or the sun's disc in a wintry sky "red," though his actual sensory experience will be called "green" by A. If a skilled demon deftly interchanges the sensations of A and B as they look at a boiled lobster the crus- tacean will seem to each to change. This might be true, mutatis mutandis, for all sensory or perceptual experiences. Since no demon has the needed experimental finesse, the common assents cannot be directly tested. Though we must begin, as Eddington begins, with the impossibility of comparing A's "sensation of the taste of mutton" with B's, we end, as Eddington seems to end, with substantially the same visual experience for A and B of the seven stars in the Plough. The substantial sameness of the perceptual world for each person, manifested in universal assents, is a presupposition of common sense and an explicit postulate of logically assessed science. Experience contains too many perceptual assents, and happens too consistently as if many similar human beings have similar perceptual experiences, for the postulate to be more than momentarily doubted. Hermann Melville compares the bottom of a whale-boat to critical ice which supports a considerable distributed weight and soon breaks as the weight is concentrated. One perceptual assent cannot stand the verificatory strain; innumerable perceptual assents do stand it, Perceptual assents involve other persons in the whole reality of the perceptual world. When two farmers discuss a pig they do not appraise its fleece as if it were a sheep. Each human being normally treats anything as being what it is, and not as what it is not, though he may lapse unwittingly on occasions. He recognizes his own practice and the habit of his fellows when the logician states it in the Law of Identity, as it is traditionally called. If "every man over forty is a scoundrel," as Bernard Shaw says, then the author of the aphorism is a scoundrel because he is over forty. The deduction is logically valid, however fervent the hope that it is empirically false. Such logical assents cannot be shaken like perceptual assents, and are essential for coherent thinking. If Bernard Shaw is not a knave, he disproves his own aphorism because the knavery deducible from it is incompatible with fact. If his knavery, or the knavery of any one over forty, were not so logically deducible, the proposition could not be checked because men over forty would be or not be scoundrels quite irrelevantly to its truth. Such logical validities as the Shaw syllogism are virtually acknow- ledged and followed by all normal human beings. Abnormal humans do so too, for the madman often argues logically enough from eccentric premisses to their necessarily absurd, though logically valid, conclusions. 251</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY When the logician analyses out such logical validities they are confidently acknowledged. They are implicitly acknowledged during intercourse, and logical assents constantly verify for each human being the existence of others who think as if in this respect they are like himself, for his fellows would puzzle him if their logic were perverse, and, indeed, much coherent intercourse would be impossible if either the Law of Identity or the Shaw syllogism were not accepted. The experient, of course, does not deliberately argue that logical assents verify the existence of others, or even realize that they do so, but he does partly believe in their existence because the logical assents help to establish the belief. The alchemical writer Zosimos warned the operator, "on opening the cover," not to put his "nose too close to the mouth of the jar." Disobedient operators would subsequently agree that there had been a disgusting smell. There have been many mnemic assents since over disgusting smells from sulphuretted hydrogen. Shared memories flood intercourse and convince each of many similar others. Mnemic assents, like perceptual and logical assents, establish the belief in other people, are not argued from explicitly, and also involve the belief in the reality of the whole perceptual world. The three assents happen as if many essentially similar human beings exist, and they happen so often, so continuously and so regularly that they establish an inveterate belief in other people. If the logical analysis of the belief into a verified hypothesis remembers the enormous scope of the verification it resolves "merely inferred friends" into merely logical bogys. The three assents, either as establishers or verifiers, do not require or imply a set of duplicate humans. When two former school- fellows meet again after many years their many unshared memories do not make their shared recollections dim or dubious. Any two people, of course, have a common mnemic ground in countless common experiences-in the bite of the east wind, for example, or in the twinkle of a star. Their realization, normally unreflective or implicit, of a common mnemic organization confirms in each, as experience constantly confirms, the existence of others like himself. Mnemic diversities need not, and do not, weaken the establishing powers of mnemic assents. They actually help each person to realize in others a mnemic organization essentially similar to his own. No two people have precisely the same set of recollections, but, however different the sets may be, each of the rememberers knows that the other remembers as he himself might have remembered if he had lived the other's life. Other people manifest themselves to any individual as if they have mnemic organizations similar to his own. This manifestation establishes, or helps to establish, in him a belief in the existence of others like himself. It establishes the belief: he 252</page><page sequence="10">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER does not argue or deliberately infer or even recognise explicitly the existence of mnemic organization. In a recurrent dream a skeleton clutched a patient of Dr. Gregory by the throat. Any dreamer recognizes his own dreaming, though not his own dreams, in the dramatically dreaming patient. Diverse experiences can help to establish the belief in similar others through the common experience involved. The dreamer, as Heracleitos noted, lives in his own private world, and his fellow can usually no more detect experiences in him than in a waxwork. The privacy of all individual experiences is evident in the dream because the usual manifestations, by which Jack, for example, learns much about his Jill, are absent. This privacy often obscures for one man the judg- ments or sensations or opinions or feelings or purposes of another, and may keep them as secret as any dream. Peter's belief in the existence of other people need not waver because he often does not know, or only precariously infers, what they think or feel, for he can place them in the same difficulty, and this very common pre- dicament makes all men kin. The dream is a reminder that even a very wholesale ignorance about other people is compatible with a sufficiently verifying knowledge about them. The patient could tell his dream to Dr. Gregory: the dream also points to the supreme importance of responses and communications in establishing the belief in other people, for the dreamer keeps his secret because sleep quenches his responses. If the approaching strangers are men, the solitary Robinson Crusoe realizes, they will respond to him in some human way. Human responses vary from kisses to blows, but each responsive human being recognizes his own gamut of responses in responsive others. In particular, as he speaks or is spoken to he discovers speakers who speak as he might speak if someone speaks to him. In gesture, speech or writing others communicate with him as if they are communicators like himself, or are communicated with as he so often is. They use words, in spite of obscurities and ambiguities, as if these words have the meaning for them that they have for him. Through all variations or misunderstandings these others respond, speak or write as if they have, for example, a general notion of "dog," or ideas concerning justice, money, democracy, fascism, and the like, just as he has. He can understand that if they are men like himself they will be mistaken at times or muddled at others. If these others are like himself each of them will believe in the other others, and they act, respond, speak and write as if they do. The lion is presumably not troubled by the problem of merely inferred lions. His acceptance of other lions probably does not grow into the explicit recognition that there are other lions like himself. 253</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY In so far as he does virtually infer their joy in the chase or anger in the fight, if he does so virtually infer them, he presumably has no realization of his own inferring or of such a thing as inference. He may also rejoice in the chase, delight in the kill, enjoy the meal and feel fierce in the fight without knowing that he has joy, satis- faction or fierceness. Since we have no direct or intuitive knowledge of the lion's potentially introspectible experiences we are compelled to infer how much or how little he resembles ourselves. If our fellows were no more responsive to us than lions we should be confined to similar and precarious inferences about them. Language, preeminently among all responses and communications, leaves the lion for us much of a psychological enigma, or much of a precarious inference, and brings our fellow humans well within our own psychology. Our anthropomorphic tendency to project too much of ourselves into any animals is discouraged when speech does not connect us with them as it connects us with our fellows. Lan- guage does not merely manifest a convincing likeness between our- selves and others because we speak or write, and so do they. It discloses an enormous range of manifestation in which others respond as if they have experiences essentially like our own. Through it our perceptual, logical and mnemic assents extend vastly in extent and diversity. The contrast between saint and sinner, or between genius and fool, does not destroy and usually does not even weaken the recognition that others manifest to us as if they see colours, hope, fear, hear sounds, feel, judge, infer, conceive and experience in countless ways as we do. The wholesale verification of a hypothesis, continuously, exten- sively and multifariously throughout experience, seems to be the best attainable logical justification of our assured beliefs in the existence of other people who are essentially like ourselves. Experi- ence establishes the belief peremptorily in us for logic to assess. The analogical assessment comes close to the actual establishment at one point-we believe in the experiences of others, though they are as inaccessible to us as the lion's, because we have experiences ourselves. The process can then be logically assessed, and the belief justified, as an overwhelmingly verified hypothesis. The presumed others manifest too convincingly as if they do have experiences like our own for belief not to swallow up presumption. The behaving bodies play their important part. As responsive bits of the perceptual world they help to establish the great belief; with their correlated introspectible experiences they provide the analogical assessment. The verificatory manifestations depend greatly on them-language, to take one highly important item, is on one side largely highly elaborated and refined gesture. Through them, also, it is probable, the experiences which most essentially 254</page><page sequence="12">ON KNOWING ONE ANOTHER constitute the others share in the inescapable reality of the per- ceptual or material world. The logical status of the others in whom every human so assuredly believes must be assessed as inference. The disturbing notion of probability, which experience so constantly connects with inferring, is at least alleviated, if not removed, by assessing the great belief as an overwhelmingly verified hypothesis. The others guarantee themselves effectively by manifesting so continuously, extensively and multifariously as if they are what they are supposed to be. Their guarantee establishes the belief, however uneasy it makes the logician. 255</page></plain_text>
