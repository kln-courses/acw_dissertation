Film also raises other issues that are important to a reflexive and interac- tive archaeology: the relationship between archaeologi- cal investigators and local people, the desirability of re- porting in various ways to various constituencies, the use of film as an appropriate way of reporting, and the value of people's responses to film for further archaeological analysis. Here the issues are discussed in the context of making a film about the Sphakia Survey, an archaeologi- cal field survey in southwestern Crete.* INTRODUCTION One of the most interesting things about tech- nologies such as film is that they can bring out is- sues that were there all along.

Andreadaki-Vlazaki, V. Niniou-Kindeli, and S. Markoulaki of the KE' Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Khania, for granting us the permits and giving us the practi- cal assistance that have made the work of the Sphakia Survey possible. I also thank the Canadian Archaeological Institute in Athens for processing our permits. I am most grateful for financial support for all members of the project: from Queen's University at Kingston; the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; the Institute for Aegean Prehis- tory; the University of New Brunswick at SaintJohn; in Ox- ford, Lady Margaret Hall, Magdalen College, the Faculty of Literae Humaniores, the Research and Equipment Commit- tee, and the Craven Committee; and Baylor University. Spe- cial thanks to my co-filmmaker S. Price; C. Beesley and K Watts, Educational Technology Resources Centre, Oxford; K. Bou- ra, former first secretary, Greek Embassy, London; and E. Pro- topappa at ERT2, the cultural channel of Greek national tele- vision, for arranging enthusiastically for the screening of the video in Greece and for subtitling it in Greek. Thanks also to P. Allen, who invited Price and me to contribute to the panel on Archaeology and Film at the 98th Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in NewYork, December 1996; for the abstract, see Nixon and Price 1997. In Sphakia, thanks are due especially to K. and T. Athitakis (Anopoli) and to S. Vranakis and the Koukounarakis family (Frangokastello). I would like to thank all the students and specialists working on the Sphakia Survey for their dedicated participation. gy, film, to a particular archaeological project, the Sphakia Survey, which I codirect with Jennifer Moody.' Between 1988 and 1995 Simon Price and I worked on making a film about the survey. The orig- inal purpose of the video was for it to be an instruc- tional video for university classes, especially in Can- ada and the United States, where many students have never seen a Mediterranean landscape. Be- cause the video was shown, with subtitles, on Greek national television, it also became a way of report- ing on our work, and our view of the landscape, to people in Greece. As this article went through var- ious stages of revision, the real issues linking the technology of film with a particular archaeological project emerged. In this case, making a video about an archaeolog- ical survey in Greece raised important intellectual In Canada, I thank my archaeology students at the Uni- versity of New Brunswick at SaintJohn, especially those of 1992-1993, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for including our project in a CBC News for New Brunswick tele- cast. In Oxford, I thank my archaeology and anthropology stu- dents, particularly T. Allen, C. Cramp, B. Dempsey, T. Gra- ham, and E. Sage; they and others were helpfully critical par- ticipants in relevant tutorials. So, too, was Jordan Jacobs, a junior-year-abroad student from Stanford University, who re- quested (and got) eight tutorials on Archaeology and Ethics early in 2000, when most of the major revisions for this arti- cle were done. M. Banks, Institute of Social and Cultural An- thropology, Oxford, gave much useful advice on ethnographic film. Comments from the anonymous referees were extraor- dinarily useful in improving the whole article. D. Shankland, University of Wales, Lampeter, made crucial comments on an earlier version of the conclusions. The staffs of the Ash- molean Library, the Library of the Oriental Institute, the Bal- four Library (Pitt Rivers Museum), the Magdalen College Li- brary, the Taylor Institution Library (Slavonic and Greek Sec- tion), and the Tylor Library (Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology) were instrumental in providing the books and journals I needed. And finally, thanks to S. Price, who suf- fered through all the various stages of revision, and remained helpful to the end. I am responsible for the faults that un- doubtedly remain. 'S. Price, an ancient historian, and 0.

Here I would like to discuss the video as a way of opening a dialogue on the research process between fieldworkers and local residents, both of whom possess valuable, but often different, knowledge of the same landscape. Such issues are of obvious general relevance to anthropologists as well as archaeologists, and they have particular rel- evance to archaeologists and anthropologists col- laborating on projects such as the archaeological surveys discussed here. Throughout their respective histories, the inter- ests of archaeology and anthropology have often converged, most recently on landscapes and how humans respond to them. Both fields previously tended to see landscape as merely the backdrop for human activity, past and present. Now landscape itself is often a focus of inquiry, particularly in ar- chaeological surveys or "landscape archaeology"; anthropologists also now see landscape as a posi- tive force in human cultures.2 One of the best ways of showing landscape and how people interact with it is to use film. Film has been important in anthropology for some time, beginning with the Torres Strait Expe- dition 100 years ago, and its role in anthropology has been debated almost as long.3 One important, if often unstated, function of anthropological film is to show the landscape of the cultures discussed in the film. Film in archaeology has had a some- what different history, as it typically has been used to show excavations in progress. In archaeology, films have long dominated pop- ular perceptions of the subject, ranging from the sensationalism of IndianaJones to the more respon- sible popularizing of Michael Wood orJohn Romer. Films about specific archaeological projects have also been important, but the dominant expectation that they must display "broadcast quality standard" has meant that films are made by professional film- makers rather than by archaeologists.4 In such cas- es academics can be disappointed at the way their ideas have been used, because the filmmakers' voice either distorts or excludes the archaeologi- cal discourse. The issue of voice becomes more complicated when the film concerns not just one 2Cherry et al. 1991; Mee et al. 1997; Tilley 1994; Hirsch and O'Hanlon 1995; Ashmore and Knapp 1999; Gosden 1999; Ucko and Layton 1999. 'Banks and Morphy 1997; Edwards 1998, esp. 106 n.1 for specific film references. The members of this pioneering, col- laborative venture were a zoologist, a psychologist, a musician, a linguist, a physical anthropologist, and a photographer (Had- don 1901). See Slobodin (1978, 19-25) for the impact of the investigator but also a whole team of scholars. When the film is part of a project that has an ethnograph- ic component, a further level of complexity arises, namely, the relationship of both the project and the film to local people. In my view, it is not an accident that discussion of the relationship between archaeologists and local people should arise from survey archaeology, which, in its systematic and diachronic form, is a relatively recent addition to archaeological fieldwork. Survey work, like excavation, involves a team of archaeolo- gists and other specialists, but it looks at a larger area or region, a "landscape," often over a period of mil- lennia. From the beginning of the first systematic projects in Greece some 30 years ago, truly diachro- nic surveys have spanned periods well beyond late antiquity, the usual boundary for classical archaeolo- gy. Indeed, some surveys incorporate the present into the research, so that both archaeologists and local people are included in the landscape being studied. Thus both groups can contribute to an un- derstanding of its resources and uses through time. During the last 30 years, important shifts also have occurred in social and cultural anthropology that affect and benefit from landscape archaeology. The traditional research focus was a village or other nar- rowly defined space, studied for one "ethnograph- ic year" by a single anthropologist rather than a team. Once the study was done, the "community" was not expected to change in any significant way. In many cases, symbolic rather than material ques- tions were considered more important. More re- cently, however, anthropologists have come to reaf- firm that material culture can enrich anthropolog- ical knowledge, to realize that "communities" can fruitfully be considered as parts of larger land- scapes, and to incorporate time depth into anthro- pological research.5 Archaeology and anthropology have thus, in some ways, converged as disciplines, and this conver- gence is particularly clear in survey projects, with their diachronic perspectives, interest in land- scapes, explicit inclusion of both kinds of fieldwork, and, in many cases, inclusion of both archaeologi- cal and anthropological fieldworkers.6 But until expedition on one of the members (Rivers, the psychologist). The Torres Straits Expedition is also remarkable because only three years after the first screening of moving pictures, Had- don included a cinematographe as part of the expeditionary equipment (cf. Grimshaw 1997). 4Allen 1997. 5Herzfeld 1982, 1991; Karakasidou 1997. 6Sutton 1991. 78 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="3">FILM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTING recently, one important difference between the two disciplines had remained: while anthropologists have for some time been systematically concerned about the relationship between researchers and the people among whom they do their fieldwork, ar- chaeologists have not. The relationship between archaeologists and local people is easiest to see when the latter share their own knowledge of the research area with the project's fieldworkers. But even where local people do not directly contribute to an archaeo- logical project, they have an interest in the land- scape, and archaeologists should report to them as well as to colleagues and others. I suggest that there is an important relationship between local residents and incoming archaeologists, that this relationship needs to be fostered through appro- priate reporting, and that video can be an appro- priate technology for local publication of archae- ological results. THE SPHAKIA SURVEY The main objective of the Sphakia Survey was to reconstruct the settlement patterns and land use of the regions over a long time span, from ca. 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1898, the end of Turkish rule on Crete. After an exploratory pilot season in 1986, fieldwork was conducted from 1987 to 1992. Analysis of finds began in 1989 and continued until 1998 in con- junction with other specialist work. Our efforts are now focused on the final academic publication in two volumes and a survey Web site.7 Sphakia is an administrative district in southwest- ern Crete covering some 472 km2. It is a rugged area with considerable altitudinal compression: in only 16 km, the landscape changes from palm trees on the coast to elevations of ca. 2,400 m at the top of the White Mountains, where there is snow even in summer. The area is dissected by about 12 gorges running south to the Libyan Sea, of which the most famous is the Samaria Gorge. Sphakia has been known for its landscape since antiquity-Theophrastus commented favorably on the cypresses in the mountainous area near Tar- rha (HP 2.2.2). Its external identity as a wild, ro- mantic landscape inhabited by picturesque, vio- lent people was clinched by R. Pashley's descrip- 7Relevant Sphakia Survey publications to date: Nixon and Moody et al. 1988, 1989, 1990, 1994; Moody et al. 1998; Fran- cis et al. 2000; Nixon and Price 2001; note also Nixon et al. 1998. The Web site is intended to complement the final pa- per publication; it launched in October 2000 (Nixon and tion of it in the 19th century.8 Today it is the land- scape of Sphakia, rather than "cultural" attractions such as archaeological or historical sites, that at- tracts tourists; the Samaria Gorge is hiked by some 250,000 people per year during May through October. We, too, were influenced by the landscape of Sphakia in selecting it as our research area. If there were ever an area where geographical determin- ism would dictate people's activities, it would be somewhere like Sphakia, with its sharply dissected terrain and minimal arable land; yet even the land- scape of Sphakia has more flexibility than geograph- ical determinism might admit. For example, in some periods people preferred to live on the coast while in others they chose to live inland, and it was clear that a diachronic survey would give us the chance to account for this long-term alternation in settlement preferences. We were intrigued, too, by the ambivalence of the Sphakiote landscape-at times a harsh, dangerous place or a merciful ref- uge; we wondered what factors enabled people in some periods to tame the landscape, while in other periods life in Sphakia was so inimical that people abandoned it. The Sphakia Survey has worked at every eleva- tion and in every environmental zone. We selected areas for investigation on a stratified random basis and transected sets of quarter kilometer squares. We walked line transects where such squares were impractical (gorges, mountaintops), engaged in fo- cused extensive exploration, and revisited all the sites. This fieldwork revealed 315 sites spanning 5,000 years, which we have divided into three major epochs (Prehistoric, Graeco-Roman, and Byzantine- Venetian-Turkish). From the beginning, the project aimed to collect and synthesize all possible types of evidence. Data were categorized in four groups: environmental (e.g., pollen cores, taxonomic botany, land use, cli- mate); archaeological (sherds, stone tools, coins, bone, metal objects, glass, building remains, and standing structures); documentary (ancient and later inscriptions; Byzantine, Venetian, and Otto- man manuscripts and texts; Cretan poetry, both written and oral; novels, such as those by Kondy- lakis and Waugh); and anthropological.9 During Moody et al. 2000). The Web site includes a section by Price on the making of the film discussed in this article. sPashley 1837, 2:247-8. 9Kondylakis 1987; Waugh 1955. For anthropological refer- ences, see infra n. 11. 2001] 79</page><page sequence="4">LUCIA NIXON much of the fieldwork we did not use a separate category for the information given to us by people living in this landscape. Rather, we categorized in- formation about them as ethnographic data, while we considered the local knowledge supplied by them, on which our work and safety sometimes de- pended, to be friendly and crucial, yet anecdotal in nature. This working relationship will be discussed further below. One of our most important findings on human use of the landscape of Sphakia pertains to inhabit- ants' use of and interaction with this geographical- ly dissected terrain. Much of Sphakia is made up of a series of north-south units or spines, with moun- tains inland at the northern end and the coast at the southern end. Each spine is made up of land at three altitudes, which we have called up (e.g., 1,800 masl), middle (600-800 masl), and down on the coast."' Thus our general conclusion, based on en- vironmental, archaeological, documentary, and an- thropological evidence, combined with local knowl- edge and our own experience, suggested that peo- ple in Sphakia balanced internal givens (the land- scape, its resources, themselves) with external forc- es (imperialism on various scales, with or without actual invasion) in different ways in different peri- ods, which we are now able to specify. HISTORICAL AND ETHNOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND OF SPHAKIA The following account draws on my own person- al observations since 1986 (though I am not an an- thropologist) and on the work of other scholars, including anthropologists who have worked in Sphakia." At the end of the Turkish period (the latest peri- od covered in the survey) people tended to live in two altitudes, down (but not actually on the coast) and middle, and to use the up altitude as a major resource for shepherding. Sphakia in the 18th and 19th centuries was a landscape of revolt: Daskaloy- annis, who came from Anopoli, led an uprising in 1770; the meeting to set up a revolutionary com- mittee in Crete was held in Loutro in 1821;'2and a "' Nixon and Moody et al. 1994, 256-8; Nixon and Price 2001. "' Anthropological work in Sphakia includes that of Donald Tumasonis (1983), based in Agios Ioannis in the 1970s; Cor- nelia Vogelsang, based in Livaniana (unpub. pers. comm.); Sean Damer (1988, 1989), based in Askyphou in the 1980s. Xan Fielding's account (1954) of his return to Sphakia after World War II is also useful. ' Spanakis n.d. 2:51-4; 250-2. famous massacre of the Turkish forces occurred in 1821 in the Krapi Gorge just north of Asky- phou.13 Sphakia at this time was a refuge for peo- ple involved in uprisings, and its population may have peaked in the later 18th and earlier 19th centuries. In the first half of the 20th century, Sphakia was a landscape of somewhat illusory free- dom. Although the Turks were gone, Sphakia di- minished from glorious revolution to tax-paying normality, first as part of the newly independent Crete and then as part of the larger Greek state. Sphakia was disproportionately underinvolved in the Exchange of Populations (as ratified by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923) and overinvolved in the aftermath of the Battle of Crete (1941), with the evacuation of the Allies through the Imbros Gorge to Khora Sphakion. One Sphakiote village, Mouri, was strafed by the Germans and never in- habited again. The destruction of Mouri was an early and violent warning of the next phase of the 20th century, from the end of World War II to the impact of the European Union (EU), when Sphakia became a landscape of abandonment. From the later 1940s to the mid 1980s in Sphakia and other parts of Greece, the landscape and its resources no longer sufficed, and significant num- bers of people left. The Greek government bought out the few remaining inhabitants of Samaria when the National Park was established in the 1960s. By the time the Sphakia Survey began, another major change had been caused by Greek member- ship of the EU. Greece joined what was then the Common Market in 1981, but several years passed before the effect of EU policies was felt in Sphakia. From the later 1980s to 2000, Sphakia had changed again to a landscape of accommodation. On the one hand there was the heritage of the late Ottoman/ early modern Greek period, Sphakia as a landscape of revolt and freedom, with independent pastoral- ism as the basis of the economy.14 The tough, rug- ged inhabitants still settle some disputes by (inter- nal) family decision first and the (external) rule of law second, and celebrations for engagements, wed- dings, and baptisms are marked by gunfire.'5 The 'Pashley (1837 2:170-9) visited here shortly afterwards. 14Cf. Nixon and Price 2001. 15 Loud noise is an important component of many Greek celebrations, e.g., firecrackers at Easter; but the more or less compulsory use of guns and live ammunition in Sphakia to produce the noise is self-consciously different and far more dangerous.

Present reality is rather different. Cheese pro- duction, which has been the product of special- ized pastoralism here at least since the late 17th century, is now economically viable because of EU subsidies for feed and fencing.'l Other people make a living in Sphakia through tourism.'7 Togeth- er, tourism and EU subsidies have done what cen- turies of foreign rule by Venetians and Turks could not do: they have destabilized local economic con- trol based on heroic shepherding up in the moun- tains. The "long view" of archaeological survey re- gards this as another stage in the long-standing cy- cle of alternating preferences for coastal and in- land bases for significant economic activity. A more tightly focused ethnographic perspective sees that the current inhabitants of Sphakia face a crisis of identity. They can choose exile by leaving their pas- toral life for city life, which results in a loss of real familiarity with, and connection to, the landscape of Sphakia, despite emigre organizations such as the Union of Sphakiotes Everywhere (Enosi Apan- dakhou Sphakianon). If they choose to remain in Sphakia, they are often seen as marginal, backward, and out of step with modern, progressive Greece. The notion of a successful businessperson, howev- er, has yet to replace the old, heroic ideal of the free shepherd of the White Mountains. Thus to some extent, Sphakia is today a landscape of con- tested identity. What of Sphakiote views of their own local past? In terms of the Survey's three epochs, the most im- portant past was the most recent, the Byzantine-Ve- " Nor are male shepherds the only ones to receive EU sub- sidies; EU money has also built a weavery (iphandirio) in Anop- oli, where women can weave year-round for money. 17 See below for further discussion of tourists as "sheep with- out bells." Most people who live in Sphakiayear-round and work in the tourist industry must forsake the traditional modern villages at the roots of the mountains or at the middle altitude in order to be down on the coast in locations preferred by tour- ists. Many other Sphakiotes live outside the eparchy during the winter and return only for the tourist season (from West- ern Easter until September/October). '1P. G. Saviolis, interview in Anopoli, 24June 1992; Sphakia, Mani, and Souli are the three fortresses of Hellenism; all three places mounted important revolts in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. " "When shall we see the springtime stars, when will the brooklets run?" (Potes tha kami xasteria potes tha phlebarisi); the song was sung against the Venetians and only later against the Turks (Morgan 1960, 25-9). Morgan also points out that the netian-Turkish period, the time of glorious, and ultimately successful, revolts against alien oppres- sors. The legacy of these revolutionary times can still be felt a century later through the notion that Sphakia is somehow quintessentially free, Greek, self-sufficient, and "tough." A local priest described Sphakia as one of the three fortresses of Hellenism (kastra tou Ellinismou), along with Souli and the Mani.18 One of the most famous Cretan revolt songs, still sung on public occasions, is set partly in Sphakia.'9 Indeed the local view is still that "the Turks never set foot in Sphakia,"2" and further that Sphakiotes never paid taxes to the Turks.21 This claim is true in the sense that no Turks ever settled in Sphakia (hence the underinvolvement of the area in the Exchange of Populations, as already mentioned), but untrue in other senses. For exam- ple, the Greek spoken in Sphakia has the same kind of borrowings from Turkish as the Greek spoken elsewhere in Crete. Moreover, the Turks left physi- cal traces throughout Crete, including some con- spicuous Turkish forts in Sphakia such as those in the Askyphou Plain and those south of the old vil- lage of Agia Roumeli.22 The only other noticeable old monuments in Sphakia until the end of the 19th century were churches. The bust of Daskaloy- annis in the main square in Anopoli, commemorat- ing the first major revolt in 1770, was not set up until the latter part of the 20th century; until re- cently there was no effort to preserve his house.23 Thus the falsity of the claim that the Turks never set foot in Sphakia does not weaken the intensity with which it is held. By contrast, local views of the Graeco-Roman past in Sphakia focus entirely on physical remains, such as the "Thick Wall" (pakhy toikhos) at Anopoli, which song draws a comparison between free Sphakia and the epar- chy of Selino to the west, which was home to Moslemized Cret- ans, "the Christians' most fierce adversaries" (Morgan 1960, 26). 2'We heard this claim frequently in Sphakia. For confirma- tion, see Herzfeld 1997, 88; also 39 and 249 on the supposed purity of Sphakiote physical appearance and descent. 21 Damer 1989. Further clarification is necessary about the taxation of Sphakia in the Ottoman period: it is true that peo- ple in Sphakia did not pay taxes to the Sublime Porte (Istan- bul), but they did pay taxes to the charitable foundation (vaqf) of Mecca and Medina. 22 The obviously hated Turkish forts were destroyed in 1878 after a revolt (Khatzidakis 1881, 88-90); the easternmost of the three forts in Anopoli was transformed into a milking pen. Because there had been no Turkish settlement in Sphakia, there were no mosques there either; the nearest one was in Kandanos, in the eparchy of Selino (west of Sphakia). " Geronimakis 1999. 2001] 81</page><page sequence="6">LUCIA NIXON is part of the ancient city wall of Anopolis. Similarly, people in Agia Roumeli know where ancient Tar- rha was located. Anopolis and Tarrha were both free Greek cities, and it is perhaps true that local aware- ness is more precise about them than about Loutro, the ancient Phoinix, whose remains are mostly im- perial Roman (rather than Greek). This awareness seems to come from local oral tradition, confirmed by schoolteachers, rather than from knowledge of archaeological work by foreign archaeologists or by the Greek Archaeological Service. People in Sphakia had little or no previous aware- ness about evidence for any prehistoric phase in the eparchy, probably because little material of this date had been found before the Survey began. They were invariably surprised to see, and hear about, sherds of Minoan date, possibly because they asso- ciate the Minoans with palaces, and to date no pal- aces have been found in Sphakia.24 During the 10 years of fieldwork, we were depen- dent on the information provided by local residents. Much of this information, both practical and intel- lectual, was vital to the interpretation of our finds: toponyms (and their meanings); location of water sources; the patterns of land ownership at differ- ent altitudes; the organization of pastoralism in the White Mountains; local textile production and the distribution of finished work; the role of churches and icon stands as markers of landscapes; and in- volvement in tourism.25 In return, we told people in Sphakia about our activities and where we were going each day. Upon meeting people during fieldwork, we explained that we had the necessary permits, that we were col- lecting only surface finds, and that those finds would end up in the nearest museum (in Khania on the north coast of Crete). In terms of our relationship with external author- ity, we made it clear that we were there only because we had a permit from the Archaeological Ephoreia in Khania, so that from the beginning people knew that we, too, were constrained by officials outside Sphakia and that we were far from all-powerful. 24Hood 1965, 1967. The two largest Minoan sites in Sphakia both lie in the eastern side of the eparchy, closer to excavated sites such as Monastiraki, Apodoulou, and Kommos. 2 In addition to the publications already cited (see supra n. 7), see also Nixon 1999a; 2000. 2i E.g., we discovered one ancient site late in our fieldwork. It was nearAnopoli, where we had spent much of our time. No one had previously told us about this site, which was marked with a good number of sherds; but after we had been to it and Local views about our work on the past in Sphakia changed as the project continued. At the begin- ning, people thought that the material we collect- ed, mostly pottery, was at best suitable for children (people used to give gialakia, glazed sherds, to chil- dren as toys); at worst, "garbage" (skoupidia). More- over, while people would nearly always give infor- mation if requested, they would seldom volunteer answers to questions we had not directly asked. As it became clear that we were looking and learning about the real landscape of Sphakia, which they already knew, people found our work worthy of re- spect.26 Local people, both adults and children, gave us collections of sherds (alas, not always with enough information about findspots), and by the end of our active fieldwork, they were asking why finds from their own area could not be displayed in a museum case in the local township offices. We had reached this stage by the time serious filmmaking began in 1992. THE MAKING OF THE FILM Our main goal was to produce a video that would be useful in classroom instruction. Other practitio- ners of field survey will understand immediately the sort of work we did in Sphakia and the jargon used to describe it, but the methodology of system- atic field survey remains poorly understood by out- siders.27 Although systematic field survey in the Mediterranean is now over 30 years old, nonspe- cialists and outsiders remain uninformed of its methods and goals. Undergraduates enrolled in classical and archaeological courses could, we thought, benefit from learning about field survey in general, with the Sphakia Survey as an example. Furthermore, the video might serve to demonstrate the goals and potential of survey to colleagues in oth- er areas of archaeology. Another important aspect of making the film was that we made it while we were doing the fieldwork and studying the finds, before we had completed our analysis and well in advance of the final publication. At no time during the seven years when we were working on the video (1988- knew enough to ask about it, people then gave us additional information. Similarly, when in the course of work in the area of Khora Sphakion, people were pleased to hear that we knew enough to ask about the different neighborhoods of Khora (geitonies); such a question revealed our understanding of the structure of many BVT villages in Sphakia. 27 See discussions in Snodgrass 1990; Barker 1991; Nixon 1993. 82 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="7">FILM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTING 1995), however, did we think of showing it to peo- ple in Sphakia, partly because, as far as we knew, there were no VCRs in Sphakia. In selecting film as the best medium for convey- ing something about survey to university audienc- es, I was inspired by seeing Jane Cowan's early vid- eos of her anthropological work in northern Greece in the early 1980s. It was clear in these videos that moving images made both the landscape and the people within it far more vivid and memorable than could photographs or slides.28 We were not, of course, the first archaeologists to use film. In the late 1940s, Jacquetta Hawkes made several films for schools, "illustrating the develop- ment of culture and the continuity of human histo- ry." One of these, "The Beginning of History," fo- cused on British prehistory as revealed though ar- chaeology.29 But when we started shooting footage in 1988, the main use made by archaeologists of video was for internal record keeping on excava- tions.31' At that time, video was a poor way of archiving information, partly because the quality of resolu- tion is less than with still photography, and partly because of the difficulty of accessing particular foot- age. Nonetheless, video is useful as a complement to regular field notebooks: blank cassettes are cheap, and hours of excavation footage can be re- corded, in color, much more readily than with a still camera. For example, excavators of Palaikastro on Crete have recorded the supervisors' first im- pression of levels as they were being excavated.31 More recently, Ian Hodder's team at Catalh6yiik has made use of new digital technology for edit- ing and archiving film, so that the difficulty of ac- cess has been overcome. Film at Catalh6yiuk in- cludes discussions among field archaeologists as well as simple recording of trenches and sections, but its main use on the project is as an excavation diary."2 Our video, however, is not a diary for inter- nal use but an account of the survey made for ex- ternal viewing.

In 1988, the second field season of the survey, S. Price took some footage that he and the present author edited with Charles Bees- ley, ETRC's lighting cameraman. Having started filming when our objectives for the project seemed clear but our results were not, we produced a 20- minute tape. In spite of its poor quality, this short videotape conveyed enough about the landscape and the excitement of working and learning there that we decided to try again. Still focusing on un- dergraduates as our main audience, we created a film 50 minutes long and divided into two 25-minute sections, to be shown in one or two class meetings, each half followed by discussion. We were financially able to make the film because the ETRC sponsored the production by supplying equipment (which included a broadcast-standard quality video camera), paying salaries (for Beesley, as cameraman; and later, for Karen Watts, as pro- duction assistant), and providing editing facilities; we had only to find fares and subsistence. A major benefit of directing the actual filming and decid- ing the film's structure was that, rather than devolv- ing the production of the film onto outsiders or hiring a professional presenter, we retained autho- rial control and achieved "broadcast-standard qual- ity." The price we paid for this control was our time. In Crete, we had to develop ways of combining field- work and finds study with filming. In Oxford, we had to make time for the various stages of post-pro- duction.33 The actual filming was done during two separate periods after we had developed a script. Beesley filmed the project on Crete in 1992, when we were completing revisits to sites, including those in the Madhares and White Mountains. Both Beesley and Watts worked on the film in 1994, when most of our time was devoted to studying finds in the Khania Museum, though they and Price also shot addition- al footage in Sphakia. The final editing and other post-production work were complete by early 1995.34 33We made our video without the benefit of digital equip- ment and processing (which simplifies and speeds up a num- ber of processes, particularly editing), and our use of graphics was severely constrained by the (poor) quality of color print- ing available to us. Using nondigital methods, it took at least an hour to edit a minute of film, and there were numerous other time-consuming stages before and after editing. 34 Copies of the film, in any format, can be obtained from the Educational Technology Resources Centre, 37 Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JF, etrc@etrc.ox.ac.uk. 2001] 83</page><page sequence="8">LUCIA NIXON Our responsibility for the film was complete in that we ourselves doubled as filmmakers (though the film was shot by Beesley). We divided it into two sections, methods and results, though our archae- ological results are as yet preliminary. The first sec- tion considers the principles of field surveys: the aim of reconstructing the interactions of people and the landscape over long periods of time (set- tlement patterns, land use, and so on); the impor- tance of understanding the local geology; and the need to integrate documents and material evi- dence. With the questions of how archaeologists actually find material without excavating, and how they can be sure that what they do find is signifi- cant, film really comes into its own. Books or arti- cles can present principles; slide lectures can show parts of landscapes; but only moving images can present properly the processes of field survey, of peo- ple walking through landscapes and actually find- ing ancient artifacts. Field survey, which aims to dis- cover the patterns of past human interaction with the environment, necessarily also involves the mod- ern archaeological processes used to investigate that environment. Film can show these processes and thus make more vivid and plausible the logic of inference back to the past. The second section of the film, dealing with re- sults, is designed to be exemplary rather than de- finitive, to show the sorts of things that field survey can establish. In order to give this section some coherence, we focused on three north-south spines of Sphakia, as discussed above, beginning up in the White Mountains and moving through the mid- dle altitude down to the coast, to show something of the changing and interlocking patterns of land use in different environmental zones over the three major epochs of the Survey. Though the filming and editing process was the work of Nixon and Price, we were very conscious that we were only part of the team responsible for the field survey. The structure of the film is the outcome of collective discussions (and of comments by audiences on our earlier version), and the me- dium of film permitted us to present the plurality of voices that make up the survey. Interviews with Moody or Rackham, for example, gave them a chance to discuss their own specialties. This issue of multivocality is important in both anthropology and archaeology, though it takes different forms in 5 Clifford 1988, 21-54. Marcus and Cushman 1982 survey the debates; Clifford and Marcus 1986 is the crucial text. See also Wolf 1992. the two fields. In contemporary anthropology the issue principally relates to the authority of the eth- nographer's voice in relation to those of indige- nous informants. Because of an increasing desire to acknowledge the decisive contributions of local informants, there was in the 1980s a partial move away from the controlling discourse of the ethnog- rapher and towards texts that were stylistically less homogeneous, and that recognized different voic- es. The effect of this critique of old-style ethnogra- phies has been the creation of a new self-conscious- ness about the work of the ethnographer and the craft of writing up fieldwork.35 Archaeologists generally collaborate with report writing; individual scholars often are given autho- rial responsibility for particular areas of a site or types of material. The danger of this is that the dif- ferent voices may fail to talk to each other. Some- times the leader of the project imposes a single authorial line on at least part of the final publica- tion; this has the merit of clarity, but runs the risk of intellectual appropriation of the ideas and the work of other members of the team. The Catalh6yuk film is explicitly designed to encourage both discussion and interpretation based upon it. Our own relationship with local people was an important consideration in making the film, even though at this stage we had not yet planned to show it to them. We thought of this relationship in vaguely anthropological terms: we recognized local people as "informants" about various aspects of Sphakia, and we also thought it important for them to ap- pear in a film about their own landscape. While we knew that researcher-informant issues were gener- ally important in anthropology, we did not realize the extent of discussions about including local people in anthropological films.36 We tried to be- have as ethically as we could, without having much opportunity for analytical reflection about what would constitute ethical behavior for archaeologi- cal filmmakers. We therefore always asked permission before film- ing people, even those whom we knew quite well, and explained what we were doing. We discovered that people's expectations of the film we were mak- ing were based in part on their knowledge of docu- mentary films on Greek television. As a result, some people initially expressed disquiet about being filmed and would have felt exploited if we had been 36Brody 1977; Gross et al. 1988; Asch 1992; and see Asch quotation, infra n. 64; Loizos 1993.

(Nixon and Price 1995) professional filmmakers profiting from their lives, and perhaps interested only in the "exotic" aspects of local life. They were reassured, however, when told that we were filming as part of a university project for educational purposes. They felt (we hope correctly) that this meant we had a serious commitment to understanding their world and that we were not profiting financially from them. Indeed, on the part of shepherds in the White Mountains there was considerable pride in the fact that we were filming them at work. This reaction was not out of personal vanity, but because they knew that the way of life that they had chosen to follow was at risk and that the traditional process of cheese making in the White Mountains had never before been filmed. They wanted to collaborate in our ethnographic recording of a "disappearing world" that they knew had value.37 In addition to giving everyone, includ- ing archaeologists, people in Sphakia, shopkeep- ers in Khania, and students, a choice about appear- ing in the video, we also named everyone who spoke in it by inserting captions, and we listed everyone who had helped us in our work at the end of the video. We included local names in captions and acknowledgments as a way of improving on old-style excavation reports, where, in group photos, the for- eign director and trench supervisors were almost always identified, but the ordinary workmen and pot- washing women, if they were included at all, were never named, despite the importance of their skills to the excavation. For us it was important to be ex- plicit about the value of the relationship between ourselves as foreign archaeologists and the local people of Sphakia. Finally, it seemed important to observe strict gender parallelism where this was pos- sible, hence the inclusion of economically active women (fig. 1) as well as men (fig. 2). RESPONSES TO THE FILM We collected responses to the film from differ- ent audiences in Canada, the United Kingdom (in- cluding the responses of the three reviewers to date), and Greece. Analysis of the responses sug- gests that they are influenced by the exact method of presentation of all or part of the film and the cultural position of the viewer. Responses in Canada Canada, my home country, was the first place where we saw that the Survey video could provide a means not just of teaching, but also of reporting to a much broader audience. From 1989 to 1994 I taught classics at the University of New Brunswick at Saint John. UNBSJ is the newer, smaller, poorer campus in relation to the older, bigger, and far rich- er UNB in Fredericton, the provincial capital. New 37 For the "Disappearing World" series, see Loizos 1980; Singer and Woodhead 1989. 2001] 85</page><page sequence="10">LUCIA NIXON Fig. 2. Still image from the film showing Yannis Kopasakis stirring sheep's milk for cheese, inside a stone hut (mitato) in the summer pastures of the White Mountains, 1992. (Nixon and Price 1995) Brunswick is, to some outsiders, the embodiment of postindustrial marginality in a picturesque set- ting. In other words, New Brunswick and Sphakia have a certain resemblance in terms of internal economy and external perception. Students at UNBSJ were heterogeneous in many respects. Some were traditional undergraduates, aged 18 to 21, often the first in their families to attend university; others were mature students re- turning to university. Like other Canadian students whom I taught at Calgary and Queen's, many of them had little opportunity to travel to the Mediterra- nean, hence our primary goal to show them what survey archaeologists do in the unfamiliar land- scape of Sphakia. In 1992 I contacted the New Brunswick office of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and persuaded them to do a short feature of seven min- utes on the Survey as part of the CBC television news for New Brunswick. The feature, broadcast in early 1993, combined selections from the unedit- ed 1992 Survey footage with additional sequences shot specially by the CBC, showing my Greek ar- chaeology students and me in class at UNBSJ, Price working with UNBSJ staff on Survey maps, and an interview with me. The students were delighted to be part of the project through the inclusion of their 38 A shorter segment of the video was shown on a commer- cial network (MITV) as part of an interview with me. The vid- eo was finished only after I left UNBSJ, so I was not able to use own archaeology class. Other faculty, administrators, library personnel, and staff of the university could share this sense of participation because the project was connected to their own institution. The accessibility of television made it possible to introduce the survey to a wide range of people who likely knew little about archaeology or the Mediter- ranean. This broad audience included many resi- dents of SaintJohn, who were pleased to see people they knew doing something they found both inter- esting and exotic. As always, I had taken care to men- tion that it has been funded in part by public mon- ey, in our case the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. At a time when aca- demic projects in Canada, particularly those fund- ed by one of the government research councils, were regarded as useless at best and criminally wasteful of public funds at worst, the positive response evoked by this seven-minute feature was a real vote of confidence. The television feature thus gave us the opportunity to show members of the public how their tax dollars had been used and to convince them that "their" money had been well spent.38 Reviewers'Responses The first reviewer of the video was John Bennet in 1996. His review appeared when he was still it in my own classes in Canada; I did donate a copy to the UNBSJ library. Currently, I use it as assigned viewing for students in my Oxford tutorials. [AJA 105 86</page><page sequence="11">FILM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTING teaching in the United States, and his generally positive response to it is directly related to his ex- perience of teaching in a North American univer- sity. He indicated that if the film were presented with appropriate discussion, it would be a useful teaching aid in undergraduate classes, even though it was made while fieldwork was under way and the results presented were preliminary.39 Reactions from the two reviewers based in the United Kingdom contrasted with Bennet's, large- ly, I suspect, because more British archaeology stu- dents have easier (and more affordable) access to travel and fieldwork in the Mediterranean. Hami- lakis thought that the video was too simplistic, cit- ing in particular our definitions of excavations and surveys (excavation is digging a hole in the ground in one place, survey is systematically walking over an area or region and collecting finds from the surface). He is right that the distinction between excavation and survey is easy to grasp; it is not, in our experience, easy for most people to remem- ber, hence our short and simple definitions. Ham- ilakis is Greek, and his comments that in the vid- eo "the natives" (his quotation marks) engaged in shepherding and tourism are "almost absent and silent," are more directly relevant to this article and will be discussed below.4" Mee, who like Bennet has played an important role in Greek survey archaeology, did realize that a video like this could be useful for courses on Greek archaeology, but his review is based on comments from a "class of masters [sic] students," who were more advanced than our intended au- dience. Mee and his students seem not to have understood that the work of the Survey does in- clude the Byzantine-Venetian-Turkish epoch as well as the Prehistoric and Graeco-Roman ep- ochs, though both the video and our preliminary "' Bennet 1996. 4Hamilakis 1997. 41Mee 1998; cf. Nixon and Moody et al. 1989, 212-3 quoting Randolph 1687. With the benefit of hindsight, we could have improved the video's potential for classroom use, and circum- vented some of these misunderstandings, by including a study guide with background information as recommended by Loizos (1993, 28 and 191). 42We had a model in the summaries written byJ.W. and M.C. Shaw, the directors of Kommos Excavations (where I excavated before I began work on the survey withJ. Moody), which they have produced since the late 1970s for people in the area of the site. The Shaws also organized an "open day" everyyear for peo- ple in Pitsidia. 4: Nixon and Moody 1988. Manoussos Glymenakis, pers. comm. June 1988, told us of the following incident: A French man, while walkingwith his family, had gone off to look forwater; tragically he never came back. People outside Sphakia said that reports show that it does. Thus he suggests that including footage of modern shepherding may have been "merely picturesque," because it is not certain this form of transhumance was practiced before "the later Mediaeval period" (which is, of course, included in the Survey). Similarly, when he says that we could usefully have contextual- ized our (preliminary) results, he mentions Mi- noan palaces and Classical-Hellenistic city-states, but nothing later.4' Responses in Greece We had planned, on completion of the project, to write a short summary of our work in Greek to circulate to people in Sphakia.42 After the first season, we wrote a brief article for the West Cret- an newspaper Khaniotika Nea, which received a very positive local response; one man said that he was pleased to see something that portrayed Sphakiotes as normal people rather than violent hillbillies.43 At the time that we were finishing the video, we did an interview by email for Ta Sphakia, a paper produced in Athens for mem- bers of the Sphakiote diaspora all over the world.44 No written report, however, could constitute the kind of reporting to local people that we really wanted to present. Given our (admittedly vague) plans to produce an account of our work for local consumption, and given the positive Canadian response to a seven- minute newscast, it is striking that we subsequently edited the final version of the video without once thinking of showing it to people in Sphakia. It is all the more striking, given that I had already gained some experience of reporting directly to informants and of receiving responses in various forms in an- other Canadian context, during the year before we started the survey.45 We knew that there were few if he had been murdered by Sphakiotes; in fact, he had fallen into a crevasse and broken his leg, and had not been able to get out. Some years later, shepherds discovered his skeleton, and brought his passport and wallet to the local authorities. 44Tzirtzilakis 1996. Tzirtzilakis, whose family is originally from the Sphakiote village of Agios Ioannis, had heard of our work and came to see us in the Khania Museum when we were study- ing the Survey finds. One of the headlines on the cover of the issue of Ta Sphakia that contained our interview with him was "What foreign archaeologists are doing in our area" (Ti kanoun oi xenoi arkhaiologoi ston topo mas). 45 In the fall of 1986 I gave a three-hour class on archaeol- ogy and anthropology as part of the first Introduction to Wom- en's Studies course at Queen's University at Kingston. I ana- lyzed Queen's student rituals linked with football as a case study for the importance of gender in anthropology, and presented my analysis to Queen's undergraduates taking the course (the section of the course on archaeology and gender became Nix- 2001] 87</page><page sequence="12">LUCIA NIXON any VCRs in Sphakia, and we had not then raised our expectations to the level of broadcasting our own (foreign) work on Greek television. But this pseudo-technical explanation is not the whole sto- ry. Our main work in Sphakia was to study the ar- chaeology and landscape, and the primary audi- ences for our results were academic; but a video for students typically does not count as a proper publi- cation, so we initially did not consider dissemina- tion to a nonacademic audience. In summer 1995 we had a viewing party of the finished video in Khania, to which we invited ar- chaeologists working for the Khania offices of the Greek Archaeological Service, Greek archaeolo- gists working in universities, and other foreign ar- chaeologists, all of whom were by then familiar with our published academic preliminary reports. They had two main reactions to the film. First, the archaeologists working for the Archaeological Ser- vice were especially pleased to be thanked by name at the end of the video, as too often they are treat- ed as faceless bureaucrats rather than as name- able scholars and administrators. Second, because both groups of Greek archaeologists, those work- ing for the Archaeological Service and those work- ing in Greek universities, are directly responsible for the archaeology of their own country, many of their comments focused on the labeling of peri- ods. We used the name Graeco-Roman, instead of the long and cumbersome Geometric-Archaic-Classi- cal-Hellenistic-Roman, to denote the second of the three major epochs relevant to the Survey. The Greek archaeologists attending the viewing party said that for Greeks, Graeco-Roman (Ellinoromaiki) means the period when Greeks were part of the Roman Empire. The label Late Roman, used in the video for the period A.D. 300-625 rather than First Byzantine, sim- ilarly troubled the Greek archaeologists because for archaeologists in Crete, Late Roman emphasizes the subordinate position of Greece in the ruling Roman world. "First Byzantine" implies continuity through the (Greek, Christian) Byzantine Empire and is a subtle reminder of the brief and ultimately unsuccessful Arab presence in Crete (A.D. 824- 961), whose departure marked the beginning of the Second Byzantine period. And finally, we were further reproved by a Cretan archaeologist for choosing to label the period Turkish rather than Tourkokratia, "Turkish occupation." on 1994). Later that academic year, I repeated the football analysis in a lecture open to the wider university and pub- lished a written version in the university's own Queen s Quar- terly. I received many oral responses from members of the Thus, on the occasion of the viewing party, Greek archaeologists were able to express their views about generally accepted archaeological labels, which nonetheless did not define time in accordance with Greek, and sometimes Cretan, points of view. The Cretan perspective is particularly sensitive here because of the combined length of Venetian and Turkish rule of the island. Cretan histories of these periods tend to focus on the glorious sequence of revolts against the alien oppressor, culminating in the final expulsion of the Turks in 1898. The film of a multiperiod survey was bound to interact with these general (and contestable) views about the bases for national and local identities. After the viewing party in Khania, it seemed in- appropriate to exclude the people in Sphakia from viewing the film. At this point we decided to show the video on Greek television. The two local sta- tions on Crete were unsuitable because their broad- casts were not received in Sphakia. We therefore arranged to have the video shown, with Greek sub- titles, on ERT2, the cultural channel of Greek na- tional television; it was screened twice, on 1 August and 18 November 1996. Before each of these broad- casts, we mailed a circular to people in Sphakia and to people elsewhere who had helped us, an- nouncing the broadcast date and time. After the first of these two broadcasts was aired, we were very positively received by local people. Sphakiotes, and other Cretans, seemed to feel that we did not sensationalize their lives; nor did we treat them as touristic subjects. Rather, they felt that they were portrayed as individuals. They could also see that our work had contributed to an analysis of Sphakia as a serious place, with its own important economic activities, and a place that they were proud that the rest of Greece could see. For one experi- enced Cretan viewer of documentaries, this was the first film he had seen that dealt with his own world (rather than, say, the Amazon jungle), and he was delighted to say that we had done an accurate re- cording job ("I wished the film would never stop"). The only Sphakiote complaint that we have heard so far was from one person who thought we had given a rather sanitized view of life in the summer pastures of the White Mountains. Thus within Crete the responses have been large- ly enthusiastic. No doubt we simplify when talking about a Sphakiote view of our film, in that there is great variety among Sphakiotes (age, gender, edu- Queen's community and saw part of my work incorporated in minutes of the Kingston City Council. One lengthy written response came to the Quarterly, to which I responded; Nixon 1987, 1988. 88 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="13">FILM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTING cation, occupation, etc.), but we have been struck by a core uniformity of response on the part of those Sphakiotes whom we know best, those aged 30 and upwards who have chosen to remain in the area.46 As to the value of the Sphakiote past, I comment- ed earlier on the changing view of local people in terms of the value of our survey finds, first viewed as garbage, then viewed as part of their local heritage and worthy of display. We seem to have reflected Sphakiotes to themselves and to the rest of Greece in a way that they found positive and acceptable.47 For example, we acknowledged the importance of shepherding by including footage of current prac- tices, in particular the continuing though dimin- ished use of the summer pastures in the White Mountains (Madhares). For Sphakiotes, the Mad- hares constitute the heart of their landscape and the core of their identity; they are not "merely pic- turesque." Our video would not have been credi- ble if it had not recognized that fact. Recently, Ta Sphakia, the newspaper for Sphakiotes in which our interview appeared, published a proposal for a museum in Sphakia with five sections, one of which was devoted entirely to the White Mountains.48 This proposal is part of the growing realization that the local Sphakiote past is worth knowing about and displaying in public. Secondly, our video describes tourists as "sheep without bells"-provata khoris koudounia, which I first used in Greek prior to making the video. Sheep, and now tourists, are crucial to the economic sur- vival and development of Sphakia, and that phrase reveals that we understand the realities of their past and present economic life. Shepherding has nev- er been "picturesque" to the people who do it, but it is culturally embedded, and the shift from shep- herding to tourism is both literally and "culturally" difficult. Thus the ending of the film, which talks about using information about the past in order to plan for the future and shows a shepherd driving 4" Outside Crete, the only really negative response we have had came from a highly educated, wealthy Athenian who seri- ously queried our linguistic and cultural competence for mak- ing the film. Such nationalistic possessiveness is understand- able, and in the film we had stressed that the work of the sur- vey had been made possible only by the formal permission of the Greek government and by the active cooperation of the local archaeological unit and the people of Sphakia. The iro- ny, however, is that this person might well have been treated with more distrust by local people than we were, and could certainly have been barred from understanding when local people chose to slip into deep dialect. We as foreigners (xenoi) might have been less threatening than a Greek clearly identi- fiable with the authority of the Greek State. This critic per- haps wished to deny the divide of center/periphery in favor of the coherentce of Greek national identity. sheep into the sunset, is less sentimental than peo- ple may think.4" There is another important aspect about the re- ception of our video. Because archaeologists in Greece have traditionally been seen as people who come to Greece and take things, the film served the important function of showing that we were truthful in our intentions of learning about the landscape. Hasluck's paper on Western travelers through Eastern eyes (in this case in Turkey) re- veals an all too familiar view of foreign archaeolo- gists in many parts of the world: they arrive with specialized knowledge, which they do not share with local people, in order to remove things.5" In our case, the video showed that we had not just come into Sphakia with a Greek government per- mit and taken our finds out of the area (as required by the Greek government, and admittedly only as far as the Khania Museum on the north coast of Crete, but out of Sphakia nonetheless); nor had we taken our ideas away-because we talked about them in the video and showed people what we had been doing in their area for the last 10 years. We also presented copies of the subtitled video to numerous people in Sphakia and members of the Archaeological Service. It was a way of handing our work back, figuratively and literally, to those who had helped us. The film has thus provided a way of reporting to our informants in Sphakia-of reporting directly and without condescension to people in Sphakia and to other people in Greece, such as government officials and other city dwellers. Through the video it has become clear to us that reporting to local people should be part of all archaeological report- ing, and that film in this case was an excellent me- dium for doing so. We are now satisfied that we have properly communicated at least our prelimi- nary results to the people who have played an im- portant role in our work. 47 For analyses of the relationships between peripheral peo- ple or areas and central ideological structures, see Herzfeld 1985; Seremetakis 1991; Hart 1992. 4 Plymakis 2000. 4' For people's awareness of the economic realities of their own lives, see Sider 1986, 168-71 for the "collar" in Newfound- land.

In a conversation about archaeology in Greece, a man living in Khania (whose family is from Sphakia) said, "Those foreign archaeologists, they came and all they did was take (pirane, pirane)."

On the one hand, there has been much public debate about the ethics of ethnographic photography and film- making.51 On the other hand, although anthropol- ogists have emphasized the ethical obligations that researchers have to those whom they study and the scholarly obligation they have to publish findings, their professional codes of practice do not hold that there is any obligation to report to informants. The American Anthropological Association defines the responsibility to informants in terms of obtain- ing consent and avoiding harm. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the Commonwealth takes a similar approach. It also gives two rather ambigu- ous messages: first, that anthropologists should at- tempt to "leave a research field in a state which permits future access by other researchers"; and second, that anthropologists' "obligations may not end (indeed should not end, many would argue) with the completion of their fieldwork or research project."52 Filmmaking offers one way for researchers to re- port to informants in a meaningful way, and hence to reciprocate with their subjects. As some ethno- graphic filmmakers have said, reciprocity is impor- tant, and giving videos (subtitled as necessary) to subjects is certainly appropriate, so long as the film- maker is satisfied that the film will not cause local offense or harm.53 Indeed, indigenous groups in North and South America have themselves drawn up an Indigenous Agreement on Audiovisual Pro- duction, asking for some degree of control in the production of audiovisuals about indigenous peo- ples, and asking, too, for a cultural archive of such materials.54 Because it has not been standard practice for anthropologists to report to informants, there has been little discussion within anthropology on the reactions of ethnographic informants upon seeing themselves.

Marg- aret Kenna, who had worked as an anthropologist on one Greek island periodically for 20 years, re- ports that it was only the showing of a film (based on her photographs) that succeeded in explain- ing to local people what she had been doing; the film also led local people to proffer new informa- tion to her.6" Summary Different audiences have different expectations of and responses to a film, depending in part on whether the film is about them or their own cul- ture. Canadian taxpayers, for example, could like and enjoy work that was to them esoteric, if it was presented in an appropriate way, in this case a vid- eo filmed in Greece combined with local Canadi- an footage. Academic reviewers' appreciation of the film varied directly with its perceived useful- ness to their teaching; their notions of what con- stituted "relevant" footage depended on their own point of view. The responses of Greek and Cretan archaeologists reveal a concern with a nomencla- ture of chronological periods that reflects nation- al perceptions of the past. Greek national identity is bound up with arguments about the relation- ship of the classical past to the modern present '7 Hoffman 1988, 161; cf. Allen et al. 1978, who regrets the lack of local views in the film but does not raise the issue of reporting back to local people.

Sphakiotes were glad to have an accurate representation of the recent past and present; they tacitly forgave us for including the Turkish forts in return for an unsensational view of themselves and their economy. They were glad to have a serious presentation of the local archae- ological past, just as other parts of Greece have, to add to the recent heroic past. It is not an accident that these concerns about the responses of local people have emerged in con- nection with a video about a survey project. Already, members of the Akamas Survey on Cyprus have ex- plicitly discussed archaeological dependence on the information provided by local informants.62 In two recent papers, Fotiadis takes discussion of the issue one crucial step further: he has reminded us that local people are not only crucial for survey work, they are also "beings who can signify" (Fotiadis' em- phasis) and are "able to engage in representation just as much as we, 'archaeologists' and 'scientists,' are." Local people are not only agricultural pro- ducers, but also "producers of meaning": "If that [i.e., accepting that local people are producers of meaning] means that we should 'grant them equal rights,' so be it-yet not in the name of a liberal, pluralist epistemology: approaching the archaeo- logical record of Greece as the product of 'strate- gists' located at complex circumstances rather than as the product of 'farmers,' 'shepherds,' etc., and with an awareness of the historicity of such signs as 'farmers' and moderns,' could be at once humbling and invigorating."63 Making a film about a survey has suggested to us, too, that it is indeed time for a new relationship between foreign archaeologists and local produc- ers of meaning. One step in the right direction is for archaeologists to report to local people, wheth- er or not they make direct contributions to the work. Here archaeology can, once again, learn something from anthropology. As Timothy Asch states, "We have learned over time that anthropo- logical studies are not a one-way street but an ex- change that involves a contract between ethnogra- pher and the people being studied, a contract which implies that in exchange for an intimate understanding of a culture and the privilege of recording it, the ethnographer will do nothing to til See Herzfeld 1982 on European philhellenes and Greek nationalism; Leontis 1995 on cognitive mapping of Hellas by outsiders and by Greeks. '2 Hayes and Thomsen 1995, who have devoted much time to the gathering of local information. exploit or misrepresent his or her subjects, now or in the future."64 Archaeology, like anthropology, is also a two-way street. Direct reporting to local people is the first step in developing an interactive and mutually use- ful relationship. The next steps are to take the re- sponses of local people seriously, to analyze them, and to incorporate them into various stages of ar- chaeological work. CONCLUSIONS In this article I suggest that researchers should widen their definition of official reporting, and report to everyone whose knowledge and opinion are relevant to the work; wider dissemination can serve to benefit their own work as well. This wider audience can therefore include the local commu- nity, government departments (such as the Greek Archaeological Service), granting agencies, and tax- payers in the archaeologists' home countries, as well as the academic world. Stuart Struever said in 1975 that one of the roles of film in archaeology is to convey the goals and techniques of archaeology to a broad audience in- cluding people who decide what will happen to archaeology in the future,65 a category that has been expanded to include indigenous people, such as First Nations people in Canada and Native Ameri- cans in the United States. The relationship between archaeologists and local people (indigenous and other) has changed accordingly. Those of us who work in the Mediterranean, or classical, world, per- haps especially those of us from Canada and the United States, may have felt until now that our rela- tionship with local people is qualitatively different from that experienced by archaeologists working with indigenous peoples. Indeed, as increasingly negative views of the latter relationship became public, many of us may have wished to distance our- selves from the problems encountered by archae- ologists in the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Only recently have positive, "decoloniz- ing" methodologies been devised for these areas, methodologies that include full reporting to (and interaction with) local people.66 But this persistent sense that those of us practic- ing Old World archaeology do not have to worry about local people is an excellent example of dou- blethink. Over 20 years ago, E. Said wrote about the 63Fotiadis 1995, 77; cf.

Let us examine, briefly, the case of Catalh6yfik, which we can do because of its commendably quick publi- cation program. I. Hodder, who directs the current excavations at the site, has announced that the four issues of reflexivity, contextuality, interactivity, and multivocality are central to his official agenda. He has discussed the "wider context" of archaeologi- cal work, citing several concerns that have widened the scope of archaeology: "reburial issues and the need to cooperate with indigenous Australian or American groups, land rights issues throughout the world, the impact of feminist archaeology."69 He agrees that universal science must be tempered "with a sensitivity to local interest" and that "scien- tific knowledge does not constitute a privileged view of the past-it is simply another way of knowing the past."7' Hodder has also said that one of his aims is combating Orientalism.7' How then does Hodder, as director of Catalh6yik, see the relationship be- tween his project and its membership, and the peo- ple who live nearby in the Konya Plain? What roles do local views of the landscape and its past play in the current work at (atalh6yik? Local people are involved, directly and indirect- ly, in Hodder's project: the dig house is in (umra, a small town some 12 km from Catalh6yfik; local staff, including workers on the site, come from a village closer to the site (Kuiiukk6y); and several other vil- lages fall within the survey area.72 I suggest that, despite their presence in the landscape and their involvement in the project, local people are not responded to, and that to date they have no official response to, or impact on, the project. 67 Said 1978. 68 E.g., Davis 2000 on the political dimensions of the Mal- lakastra Regional Archaeological Project. ;' Hodder 1997, 693. 70?Anyon et al. 1996, 15, quoted by Hodder 1997, 694. 7 Hodder 1999a, 84. 71 Cumra: Shankland 1996, 351; Kuiiukk6y: Hodder 1996, xv; survey area: Baird 1996. 73 Hodder 1998, 129. 74 Hodder (1998,131) alludes to a mention of the open days in Shankland 1996. In terms of reporting, filming at Catalh6yfik is intended only for internal consumption, as we saw above. The only public, local showing of Catalh6yik footage was in (umra, at the request of the mayor, who asked for a film and slide show to serve his own political ambitions.73 Presentations about the exca- vation have been made locally, on the excavation's initiative. Hodder states that "display panels and buildings have been provided [note the passive] and there are plans for a museum and interpretive center," presumably in part for local people, though there has been little response to open days "orga- nized [passive] for the local communities."74 By con- trast, Hodder states that he has "been struck by the fascination and interest" during tours for local work- ers: "Their eyes wide at the images, and bubbling with questions, comments and parallels with their own lives, houses and artifacts, they are excited by ideas about interpretations for the site. Far from being alienated from their past by this engagement within a global system of universal scientific knowl- edge, their sense of local identity and community seems enlivened and strengthened."75 Not one of these local questions, comments, and parallels has been incorporated in excavation pub- lications so far. Local people do essential manual work but are not part of "the team." This exclusion of local views contrasts strongly with Hodder's reac- tions and responses to "educated, informed, and active special-interest group[s]," such as the New Age Women's Movements, whose comments on Catalh6yfk's methods of interpretation are heard, summarized, and taken into account.76 People who are "educated, informed and active" have easy access to information about ;atalh6yfik in paper publications and on the Web, and these responses will be considered by the excavation team. Others may not have such easy access, partly because the official language of the project is En- glish,77 and their viewpoints, it seems, are not ac- knowledged by the archaeologists.78 Confirmation of this general impression comes from a comparison of the roles of the two anthropol- ogists at Catalh6yik. Carolyn Hamilton has observed 75Hodder 1998, 131. 76See Hodder 1997,693-4,698 for discussion of the bound- aries of"the team"; cf. Nixon 1999c. 77 Hodder (1998, 138) does say "But there are many groups with no access to the technologies, or to the knowledge nec- essary to use them." The only Turkish on the main (;atalh6yuik Web site is the name of the site (Hodder 2000). The Turkish Friends of (atalh6yuk was founded after the Friends of Catal- h6yik. On language, see Shankland 1996, 351. 78 Elsewhere A. Bartu, a Turkish anthropologist who is in- terested in the "wider context in which the ;atalh6yfik project 92 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="17">FILM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTING the archaeologists in order to study "the context of production of knowledge" at the site. Her comments on the archaeologists are rightly regarded as author- itative and are incorporated into reported interpre- tations, in which the archaeologists are named and their views carefully differentiated.79 David Shankland worked in Kuiiukk6y to see if modern village life could help with the interpreta- tion of (atalhoyuk and to monitor the local impact of the excavation ("the anthropology of archaeolo- gy"). To my knowledge, Shankland's research on local views of the landscape and its past has not yet been integrated into the project's research reports.80 Thus the comments of local people, whether made directly or filtered through the academic discipline of anthropology, are not heard or taken into account by researchers. At (atalh6yuik it seems that reflexivity, contextu- ality, interactivity, and multivocality are selectively applied. There is no sense that local people have valuable knowledge of the landscape that they in- habit; it is the archaeologists' data and the response of the "educated, informed and active" that are tak- en seriously. To understand the exclusion of local people, substitute "indigenous" for "local" in the preceding paragraphs. Does this matter? The ex- ample that follows deals with different views of the past and will perhaps show what can be gained, ac- ademically and locally, if the views of all those in- habiting the same landscape are included in the same archaeological enterprise. Nearly 100 years ago, Hasluck analyzed local ac- counts of the Hittite monument with sculptured figures in human form at Eflatun Pinar (Plato's Spring) on the other side of the Konya Plain, ac- cording to which the magician-philosopher-engi- neer Plato prevented floods in the area, and then set "talismans" (the monument) to guard the spring that marked the spot.81 Plato in these Turkish tradi- is embedded" and the politics of archaeology in the village of (atalh6yiik, mentions but does not describe a community ex- hibit about the excavations. She states, "One of the aims of the (atalh6yiuk project from the start has been to realize com- munity participation in the interpretation, management and public presentation of the site. This kind of participation is crucial for the sustainable development of the site, and the idea is to give the local people the initiative and the power in setting the terms of the development of the area and to have some kind of control over the development of the area as a tourist site." She reports on local feelings of "empowerment" and "excitement" but seems to think that local people should feel grateful for the opportunities that this project has brought them; Bartu 1999, quote 91, exhibit 94, long quote 94. Bartu's own work does not seem to involve reporting directly to local people. tions was a benignly Islamicized sage, and the mon- ument he established "long ago" was totally unprob- lematic, despite its anthropomorphic reliefs. Shankland has collected local information about Qatalh6yuik and Kiucukk6y and their respective pasts. Because of its representational wall paintings and reliefs, (atalh6yuik is now seen as definitely pre-Is- lamic. The descendants of the people who once lived there are thought to be the Greeks (Rum) who left after the Exchange of Populations in the 1920s, still clearly remembered in the area. Another mound southeast of Kifiikk6y is seen as an earlier and less successful Islamic settlement once ruled by a semi- nomadic Turkish chieftain. In contrast to the Efla- tun Plnar accounts analyzed by Hasluck, these narra- tives of the late 20th century A.D. and late 14th cen- tury A.H. reveal a new preoccupation with the cate- gories Islamic, and pre- or non-Islamic. Shankland con- firms that the diachronic trend in local perceptions of the past is continuing, ideologically and chrono- logically: increasing Islamic political activism corre- lates with greater awareness of different time peri- ods. He notes, however, that local views are still im- precise in terms of absolute dating and relative peri- odization, compared to the dominant construction of the past as formulated by archaeologists.82 But views of the past are only as precise or as vague as they need to be: the degree of precision or vague- ness depends on the agenda of the relevant group. Earlier in this article I attempted to show that peo- ple in Sphakia consider the relatively recent past to be extremely important. The period of ultimate- ly successful revolts against an alien oppressor is fundamental in the definition of modern Sphak- iote identity, and the information that people re- call for this period is more detailed and more chro- nologically nuanced, if sometimes less accurate to us, than other periods less relevant to them. As for- eign archaeologists in Sphakia, we could afford to 79 Hodder 1997, 697-8. 80 Shankland 1995, 1996,1999. Shankland says that villagers told him things more easily because they could communicate with him directly (1996, 351), the implication being that he is one of the few people connected with the project who speaks fluent Turkish. Shankland refers only to men as sources (1996, 355). 81 Hasluck 1929a (the firstversion of this article was published in 1913); see Mellaart 1962 for a description of the monument itself. 82 On Greeks (Rum) as descendants of the ancient inhabit- ants of (atalh6yiik, see Shankland 1996, 355; 1999, 145, 153.

In the case of (atalh6yiik, the point is not how vague (and ignorant and inferior) the local people are, and how precise (and rational and objective) the archaeologists are. The point is that the two groups have very different views of the same land- scape; that these different perspectives have been evaluated unevenly, at least by the latter group; and that all these differences open up some very inter- esting questions. For example, why have local views been scrutinized and found wanting, while foreign archaeological views have been underexamined and overprivileged? If we ask why local views of the past are "so vague," should we not also ask why in- coming views are so tightly focused on one particu- lar period and place, the Neolithic at (atalh6yuk? Why is the current agenda of local people increas- ingly Islamic? Why might the archaeological agen- da at (atalh6yik include issues such as the human exploitation of the environment, changes in gen- der relations and the division of labor, and elabo- rate symbolism and the processes of social control, as discussed by Hodder?83 If the local agenda might affect the local view of the past, then what effects might the archaeological agenda have on the ar- chaeological view of the past? If field methods and interpretations were examined in the light of this agenda, would changes need to be made? I am not attempting to be prescriptive about some- one else's project, but am trying to show that even someone very much aware of "the wider context" can seem to deny the actual relationship that links local people and incoming archaeologists in the landscape, and in doing so perhaps closes off in- teresting lines of inquiry. The denial of this rela- tionship is endemic in archaeology: the recent spe- cial issue of Antiquity on education has four cate- gories, historical, schools, universities, and profes- sional, but there is no separate category for local people.84 Comments on earlier versions of this article said that its tone was self-congratulatory. I would like to suggest that rueful recognition would be a more accurate description. Our own original definition of multivocality included only archaeologists. Our notions of audience for the survey video excluded everyone except English-speaking university stu- dents; because of this view, we did not invite local people to speak directly to camera. Although we had genuinely wanted to report to local people, we had not considered such reporting as part of our 3 The clearest statement of this agenda for Catalh6yfik is still Hodder 1990, 3-11, 16-18. academic obligations, and in any case we thought that our own, archaeological, outside view of the local knowledge that we found important from the beginning of the project was the only one that mat- tered. Through film we stumbled on something we were already aware of, and found a useful, accessi- ble way of reporting. We were lucky that we had any success at all, and fortunate in the help we received at every stage. I thought of having Greek on our Web site (currently under construction) only when revising this article. We still have a great deal to think about in terms of how best to acknowledge the local contribution to our work, and how best to respond to and incorporate local comments. Thus technologies like film can both distract us from, and alert us to, the issues that were implicit from the beginning. Hodder is right when he says that the "technologies perhaps provide an oppor- tunity rather than a solution."85 As members of the Sphakia Survey, we will have reasons to congratu- late ourselves only if we have contributed to archae- ologists' realization that the future of archaeology may lie in acknowledging, and changing, the rela- tionship between local people and archaeologists that has existed all along.
