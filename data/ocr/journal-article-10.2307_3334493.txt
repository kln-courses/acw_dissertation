<plain_text><page sequence="1">En general, les musees s'interessant aux arts d'Afrique s'occupent naturellement de racquisition des exemples artistiques representatifs d'un style ou d'un type spe- cifique. D'autre part, certains amateurs enthousiastes d'art african ont pu assembler des collections indivi- duelles aussi uniques que vastes. L'inclusion d'exemples extraordinairement varies demeure leur souci particu- lier. La collection de M. Herbert Baker, exposee recemment au Musee des Arts Primitifs de New York, inclut bon nombre d'exemples rares. Une analyse de leur signification et de leur relation avec d'autres exem- ples connus aboutit a une vision plus profonde de la sculpture africaine en sa variete et sa puissance creatrice. The HERBERT BAKER ALLEN WARDWELL T he activities of certain private collectors in the field of African sculpture have recently become of as much interest as the acquisition programs carried on by certain American art museums. In the latter case, the emphasis has obviously been to find and add selected pieces that best represent a specific style or type of art so that museum visitors will come away with basic no- tions of style and quality as well as an overall impres- sion of the art of a particular area. Individuals have no such obligations towards choosing such "classical" ob- jects, and have only their own tastes and attitudes to satisfy. As a result, many of the objects in personal collections are unusual variations from what are thought to be conservative artistic traditions. Some examples of collections that include pieces of this nature are Ernest Anspach's, which was shown at the Museum of Primi- tive Art in 1966, the Paul Tishman collection exhibited recently at the Musee de l'Homme and in Tel Aviv as well as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (African Arts/Arts d'Afrique, Winter, 1969), the Katherine Res- wick collection at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1968, the African portion of Jay Leff's holdings which were shown at the Carnegie Institute last year, and the Chi- cago Collection of Herbert Baker which has just been seen at the Museum of Primitive Art and is the subject of this essay. Mr. Baker first began collecting over ten years ago, and as his enthusiasm for African sculpture has grown, it has become possible to discern certain trends in his taste and collecting habits. On the one hand, there is a fascination with specific styles and expressions, such as the wood and ivory figures and masks of the Lega or the nail fetishes of the Kongo, which are represented among 30</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTION 3.

On the other hand is an interest in variations within well-known styles, and cer- tain pieces were obviously acquired because they were unusual representatives of a tribe's sculptural produc- tion. Both aspects of the collection can be noted among the objects chosen for illustration. An interesting variant of a well-known form of Bam- bara sculpture is the antelope head shown in figure 1. It has been described in the catalogue for the exhibition as a marionette head. As such, it is unusual, as most of the other marionettes known to the author are either in the form of human figures or heads. Marionettes were apparently used in dramatic presentations to re-enact certain Bambara traditions, and it could be surmised that this example may have been used to tell the story of how the antelope deity (chi wara) taught the Bam- bara the arts of cultivation. The best known representa- tions of this spirit are, of course, the headpieces which are so popular among collectors today. This head can be stylistically compared to a group of headpieces known to have been made in the northwestern region near Bamako such as those published in the Museum of Primitive Art's Bambara catalogue, (nos. 61-64). From the neighboring Senufo tribe, two contrasting objects are illustrated. The strikingly mysterious figure with the encrusted cloth costume and feather head- dress (fig. 2) served a function related to sorcery. As most African sculpture was made for protective rather than offensive purposes, figures of this nature are rare. It has been suggested that because the arms can be moved, the figures were used to throw a spell on an of- fender, and they are sometimes inaccurately referred to as executioner fetishes. As shown by an X-ray of a sim- ilar piece from the Raymond Wielgus collection, again published by the Museum of Primitive Art in its Senufo catalogue of 1964 (27), the cloth covers a crudely carved wood figure. B. Holas, in his 1960 study Cultures Ma- terielles de la Cote d'Ivoire, claims that such pieces are found only in the central Senufo region around Kor- hogo. Another Senufo sculpture is the helmet mask illus- trated in figure 3. Not much is known of the significance of these rare objects. The central motif is a fine abstrac- tion of a bovine figure, and the figure mounted in the rear, part of which can be seen between the horns, has been interpreted by William Fagg as a bird form (The Sculpture of Africa, no. 107). This type of helmet mask is thought to come from the northern Senufo area, due to similarities to a well-known piece that was in the He- lena Rubenstein collection, collected by F H. Lem in the area of Sikasso and illustrated in his Sudanese Sculpture, plates 36 and 37. Also to be compared to a well-known type from the Rubenstein collection published by Lem (pl. 10) is the Wango Society mask of the Mossi tribe shown in figure 6.

The outstanding feature of this example, of course, is the female figure, a rare inclusion on these masks, which are more commonly found having a superstruc- ture with geometric designs and two horns surmounting 33</page><page sequence="5">the face. These masks were worn both during funerals of society members and in food gathering ceremonies. From the style of the figure itself, certain affinities to Senufo carving can be noted, but these examples are purported to be from the Yatenga region which is close to the area inhabited by the Dogon. In contrast to the elegant Mossi example is the gro- tesque Ekpo Society mask from the Ibo tribe (fig. 4). Such depictions of the bent nose and deformed face ap- pear quite often among the masks of the Ibo, but it is not certain whether they are meant to represent disease (gangosa is usually suggested)or mental illness. In a recent study of the Ekpo Society of the neighboring Bini (African Arts/Arts d'Afrique, Summer, 1969) Paula Ben-Amos mentions that one of the principle functions of the cult was to combat disease, which might suggest that the former interpretation is the cor- rect one. There are many different forms of Ekpo masks, representing animals, chief portraits, skulls, etc., but none are as immediately arresting as those in this style. As a sculpture the mask falls into the "ugly" style that is so well described by Herbert Cole in his article on the Ibo (African Arts/Arts d'Afrique Autumn, 1969). 7. STANDING FEMALE FIGURE.

It comes from the area along the Kwilu and Kwango Rivers and is most probably of Suku origin. It is a type of mask found also among the neighboring Yaka, and worn by young men after circumcision to celebrate their new adult status within the tribe. Typical details are the full raffia collar and the small animal figure at the top, which is difficult to discern in the photograph. Sculptures of the Lega form the largest single group in the Baker Collection and two are illustrated here. As is well known, all Lega sculpture is made for the Bwami Society, and various types of objects were displayed to show which grade within the society had been attained by the owner. Ivory figures such as that shown in figure 8 were apparently only owned by individuals who had attained the highest grade, known as kindi. Female fig- ures of this type are among the most common Lega forms, but this is a particularly fine example with subtle carving in the facial areas and around the arms and legs. Its particularly deep patina indicates considerable age and long use. Somewhat more unusual is the exceptional wood Lega figure with the arms raised above the head (fig. 7), one of the better known pieces in the collection. Wood figures are rarer than those of ivory among the sculptures of the Lega, but are also grade emblems. Many of the figures represent important allegorical characters, and this is most probably one of these, but its iconography is not known to me. The enlargement of the hands is a particularly striking detail. Another ver- sion of this figure appears as plate 98 of African Folk- tales and Sculpture by James Sweeney and Paul Radin. Musical instruments from West Africa sometimes in- clude sculptural forms as part of their functional requi- sites. Harps which take anthropomorphic form are com- mon from the Congo, particularly among the sculptures of the Zande. Somewhat allied to these is an unusual, simplified example in the Baker collection (fig. 9). It is from Gabon and of Northern Fang origin. A sensi- tively carved head in phallus form sits atop the plain rectangular sound box. The original harp strings are missing, but it can be seen where they were originally attached. The nine pieces shown here, although only a small portion of the Baker collection, serve to illustrate the unusual nature of many of the pieces in his hands as well as to give some idea of his eclectic approach to African art. Such a personal attitude has brought typi- cal as well as uncommon examples to our attention. From the examination of collections such as this we are given further insight into the variety and creativity that are such important elements of African sculpture. a 9. HARP, FANG TRIBE, GABON.
