CURVERS Abstract Two final seasons of excavation at Tell al-Raqa'i in northeastern Syria have provided new information on the nature of a rural community in the early to middle third millennium B.C. and its involvement in the development of urbanization and sociopolitical complexity in the re- gion. The large Rounded Building, which dominated the site, was found to contain well-preserved vaulted storage facilities and can be interpreted, along with other struc- tures outside it, as a locus for large-scale grain storage and processing. Similar activities were also associated with the earliest levels at the site, prior to the construction of the Rounded Building. These results corroborate and expand our understanding of Raqa'i as an economically specialized rural community concerned with bulk storage and processing of grain, part of a system of specialized sites established along the Khabur River in probable as- sociation with developing complex polities elsewhere.* INTRODUCTION The excavations at Tell al-RaqA'i, Syria, aim to ex- amine the social and economic structure of a rural community of early urban northern Mesopotamia, exploring the extent of its integration into the emerg- ing complex societies of the region. Our concentra- tion, in contrast to the traditional bias toward the study of large urban sites, is on the rural aspect of developing societal complexity. The fourth and fifth campaigns at Tell al-Raqa'i were conducted in September and October of 1989 and 1990 and mark the conclusion of excavations at the site. The 1989 and 1990 results modify and ex- pand the picture obtained from the 1986-1988 sea- sons, completing the site plan derived from the uppermost levels and contributing unexpected new information on earlier occupation at the site. Tell al-Raqa'i was primarily occupied in the early and middle third millennium B.C., the period of the development of sociopolitical complexity and urban- ization in northern Mesopotamia and western Syria. Previously, the developmental processes of this period had mainly been studied through excavations at ur- ban centers such as Mari, Tell Chuera, Tell Mozan, Tell Brak, and Tell Leilan and through the textual evidence provided by the palace archives of Ebla.1 Such urban-based excavations have tended to furnish evidence on large-scale administrative structures and to provide associated administrative technology such as cuneiform records and cylinder seal impressions. Research at urban centers has also supplied a chro- * Excavations were conducted jointly by the Johns Hop- kins University and the University of Amsterdam in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990 (for the 1987 and 1988 seasons, see H. Curvers and G. Schwartz, "Excavations at Tell al-Raqa'i: A Small Rural Site of Early Urban Northern Mesopotamia," AJA 94 [1990] 3-23); preliminary excavations in 1986 were conducted by the University of Amsterdam (H. Curvers, "The Middle Habur Salvage Operation: Excavation at Tell al-Raqa'i 1986," Akkadica 55 [1987] 1-29). Small-scale exca- vation was also conducted by H. Curvers in the course of study seasons held in spring and fall 1991. Maurits van Loon served as project director in 1986-1988 with the authors as field directors; the authors assumed project co-direction in 1989. The 1989 excavation team included Sally Dunham, registrar and site supervisor; Inge Rossmeisl, conservator; and Ben Claasz Cookson, Ann Foster, Elvira Groenewoud, Piet Kok, Gerda Luxwolda, Marga Schoenmaker, Barbara Stuart, Caroline van Ophem-Vermey, Lineke van der Perk, Evelien van der Steen, andJoost Vermeulen, site supervisors. The 1990 team included Sally Dunham, object registrar and site supervisor; Carolyn Higginbotham, Nel Loosbroek, Gerda Luxwolda, Olivier Nieuwenhuyse, Cherie O'Neil, and Barbara Stuart, site supervisors; and Klaas van Haarten, architect and photographer.

The Middle Khabur region, with dam and projected lake nological framework for the development of societal complexity: at Leilan, for example, the shift toward urbanization has been dated to the Leilan IIId sub- phase, ca. 27th/26th century B.C., when the site ex- panded from a community no larger than 15 ha to a walled center of 90 ha.2 Discussion of the process of urbanization has con- centrated primarily on the intensified exploitation of the Syro-Mesopotamian rainfall farming plains under the stimulus of emerging elites; agricultural surpluses would have provisioned the growing urban centers and supported the labor required for elite-sponsored enterprises.3 Our understanding of increasing socio- political complexity in the early to middle third mil- lennium is now complemented and expanded by data from Tell al-Raqi'i and other small sites in the middle Khabur salvage area, which supply evidence for ag- ricultural intensification from the countryside itself. The data from these sites affirm that small rural communities could play an integral role in the devel- opment of complex society; they also indicate that our chronological models for the development of societal complexity in the Khabur may require revision. TELL AL-RAQA'I: 1989 AND 1990 EXCAVATION RESULTS Tell al-Raqf'i is a 7-m high site of no more than 0.5 ha on the east bank of the Khabur 12 km downstream from Hasseke, at the northern end of the middle Khabur rescue area (figs. 1-2). The middle Khabur valley, located south of the rainfall farming plains of the upper Khabur "triangle," has an average rainfall of 200-250 mm per year, placing it outside the rainfall agriculture belt. As a result, irrigation agriculture has predominated in the area, confined to a relatively narrow band of fields hugging the banks of the Kha- bur.4 The 1986-1988 excavations had exposed remains of the minimally attested Hellenistic level 1, uncov- 2 H.

Level 2 is defined as the poorly preserved small-scale remains later than level 3, which consists of the latest preserved phases of the Rounded Building and associated architecture. Level 4, similarly, consists of the earlier phases of the Rounded Build- ing and contemporaneous phases of architecture outside it. A certain amount of overlap between levels is unavoidable given the absence of a complete break in site occupation. The "silos" of areas 4-6, for example, were in use in both levels 4 and 3.</page><page sequence="4">400 GLENN M. SCHWARTZ AND HANS H.

The function of the building is unclear, but its size might suggest a guard post or small fort along the river. Level 2 Level 2, the latest third-millennium occupation on the site, consists of a variety of child burials and occasional architectural remains much damaged by recent graves. The child burials, dug down into level 3 architecture, were distributed along the northern and eastern fringes of the mound.

Bone fish pendant from level 2 child burial 29/132- 12 (4:3) were simple inhumations with few associated objects, others had brick constructions and an array of grave goods. The mudbrick grave constructions often took the form of a rectangular "box" of mudbricks on their sides set in a rectangular pit, with a cover of parallel bricks on their sides (fig. 3). Sometimes only the cover of parallel bricks was employed on top of the body in a pit without other brick architecture. The burial objects consisted largely of personal or- naments, particularly beads and pendants of stone, shell, bone, and sometimes copper/bronze (fig. 4). Among these were a shell pendant of a bird of prey (fig. 5), an incised bone fish pendant (fig. 6), copper/ bronze spirals (for hair arrangement?) found on ei- ther side of the interred individual's skull, and other zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. Pottery in the graves included miniature vessels, larger plain 6 H. Curvers and G.

In the southwest part of the mound, earlier third- millennium remains had been leveled by the inhabit- ants of level 2 in order to construct architecture on the newly created terrace.9 The excavated mudbrick architecture of the level 2 terrace included segments of perhaps five rooms, often with mudbrick benches against the walls, as well as basins or other lime- plastered mud or mudbrick features. To the northeast, remains of a room were exposed in excavation unit 29/102. The walls of the room were associated with two successive floors; against the walls were several mud receptacles or bins which, like the floors and walls, had a white lime plaster coating. Fragments of two smashed storage jars were found on the upper floor. Level 2 pottery from the 1989-1990 excavations was consistent with that recovered in 1987-1988, with the notable exception, from the level 2 terrace, of a large number of collared rim jar sherds of the type characteristic of Leilan II and Brak Late Early Dy- nastic III in the upper Khabur region (fig. 7.1-7),1o relatively rare in other level 2 contexts. Whether this pattern represents functional or chronological differ- entiation (or neither) remains to be determined. The ceramics of the level 2 terrace, like those of other level 2 contexts, still show little or no evidence of the straight-sided flaring bowls common in Brak Late Early Dynastic III and Leilan II." Level 2 therefore appears to belong to a phase early in the Leilan II period and somewhat before Brak Late Early Dynastic III. Ceramics of note also included a fragment of a large bowl with an inverted simple rim, decorated with small impressed circles and an incised plant motif (fig. 7.18), also attested at Leilan II,12 and a bowl sherd with an incised "snake" design reminiscent of appli- que snakes known from Leilan II and contempora- neous assemblages (fig. 7.19).13 A ceramic stand painted in red and black (fig. 7.17) has parallels at Chuera, Mozan, and Bderi.'4 Also notable is a sherd with the incised representation of a bird (fig. 7.16).15 Level 3 Architecture. The architectural plan obtained for level 3 is the most extensive available from the site 7 The burial discussed in Curvers and Schwartz (supra n. 6) 13-14, fig. 16, dated to late level 3 or early level 2, is probably to be assigned to level 2 because of its similarity to level 2 burials elsewhere on the site in its architecture, asso- ciated pottery, and small finds. Further, the shell first attrib- uted to a land snail in Curvers and Schwartz (supra n. 6) fig. 16.5 has been identified as a striped whelk, a marine shell from either the Persian Gulf or Red Sea (Engina mendicaria). We are grateful to David Reese, Department of Anthropol- ogy, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago for this identification. 8 A.

These burial goods are also closely paralleled in the furnish- ings of child burials from Abu Hijara near the wadi Aweij in the southwest upper Khabur region, particularly the min- iature animal figurines and pottery (J. Voss, personal com- munication). Intrusive child burials at 'Atij also contain many parallels to the Raqa'i 2 graves. 9 It is now clear that architecture from "stratum 4" of the step trench 42/116 excavated in 1986 was part of the level 2 terrace (H. Curvers, "The Middle Habur Salvage Operation: Excavation at Tell al-Raqa'i 1986," Akkadica 55 [1987] 1- 29). For similar mid- to late third-millennium terracing into earlier deposits, cf.

The settlement consisted of the large Rounded Build- ing, the southern segment of which was eroded, and small-scale architecture arranged in a radial pattern around it. The smaller architecture included build- ings with two square or rectangular rooms, one slightly larger than the other (areas 1-2, 15-16, 18- 19, and 83-20), conglomerations of small rooms (areas 25-33), and rectangular or square subterra- nean "silos" (areas 4-6). In the north-central part of the site (area 21) was the one-room shrine or temple with two stepped altars, isolated from the structures to the southeast and southwest by a thin pise, mud- brick, and stone enclosure wall.16 Inside the two-room structures were mudbrick benches against the walls, pise or mudbrick basins, bins and other receptacles, and clay ovens. Also typical were small round surfaces of burned clay, usually in the center of the room floor and sometimes mixed with or encircled by small pebbles. These surfaces were often shiny as if from repeated rubbing and are sometimes interpreted as surfaces for kneading dough.17 The floors, interior wall surfaces, and in- stallations inside the rooms were frequently coated with white lime plaster. In the northwest part of the site was an alley or street leading northwest from the Rounded Building, with small-scale architecture located on either side. These rooms continued to yield a variety of bins and installations. In area 56 to the northwest, for example, a lime-plastered mudbrick bench was located in the southwest corner of the room adjacent to an oven, a lime-plastered mud bin was found in the southeast corner of the room, and a round oven was situated in the northeast corner. Area 63, northeast of the tem- ple, had a lime-plastered mudbrick bench against its south wall with a rectangular opening in it 40 x 18 x 15 cm. The excavations in areas 32 and 33 in the northeast revealed a succession of level 3 building phases for these small rooms, containing remains of ovens and accompanying ashy debris, as well as several frag- ments of bone awls. In one of the phases of use in area 33 was an installation of three parallel standing mudbricks set against the northwest wall of the room, while in area 32 was another feature of three standing 16 Curvers and Schwartz (supra n. 6) fig. 12. 17 M. van Loon, "1974 and 1975 Preliminary Results of the Excavations at Selenkahiye near Meskene, Syria," AASOR 44 (1979) 103.</page><page sequence="8">404 GLENN M.

Among the burials from level 3 were a mudbrick enclosure with an interred adult having two associated vessels by the head, fit into the northwest corner of area 25, and a brick-lined pit burial in area 66 con- taining an adult with ajar by the head, located above the room floor. Below the level 3 area 6 "silo" was a pit with the burial of an adult, along with ajar by the head and a bone pin. In addition, a late level 3 brick- lined pit burial of a child northeast of the level 3 temple included a pointed-base jar and a flat-based cup, the latter with Ninevite V zigzag incisions of Leilan IIId type. Work in areas 41 and 75-79 disclosed further evi- dence of the southeastern part of the site having served as an "industrial" zone with ovens, brick plat- forms, and drains (cf. area 44, excavated in 1987). One of the ovens was installed within its own small room or enclosure (area 77) and consisted of a central hexagonal mudbrick core ringed by a round outer mudbrick wall; in adjacent rooms were circular ovens and two large storage jars sunk into the occupation surfaces. "Temple" area. Excavations below the "temple" un- covered in 1987 and 1988 exposed architecture that might be interpreted either as earlier phases of a similar building or, perhaps more convincingly, foun- dations for the structure above. Directly under the temple, and with the same horizontal dimensions, was a mudbrick platform that included a lime-plastered block of mudbricks, 108 x 60 cm in area and two courses high, situated below the area of the temple entry. Beneath this platform were the remains of a rectangular room of similar plan and orientation to 18 Cf. A.

The outer edge of the enclosure wall is approximate at points in the northwest and southwest (dashed lines = blocked doorways). the temple structure but of a smaller size, furnished with interior buttresses on its north and east walls.19 The interior of this building had no recognizable floor surfaces or wall plastering and had been completely filled in with stacks of mudbricks. That these bricks were former constituents of lime-plastered walls, reused for fill, was clear from the haphazard distri- bution of their lime-plastered surfaces. There were several indications that this lower ar- chitecture was dug into earlier deposits. The interior of the building contained, in addition to its brick fill, the right-angled corner of two walls with a different orientation than the outer walls of the room, with the reused mudbricks of the fill employed to occupy the rest of the space in the room; these two walls appear to be remains of an earlier building otherwise de- stroyed by intrusive architecture. The structures out- side the building also evinced signs of having been cut by its construction. While close examination of stratigraphic sections failed to reveal signs of a foun- dation trench, the line of such a trench could be detected horizontally to the north and east of the building. Moreover, preliminary examination of the pottery from inside and outside the building revealed many level 3 characteristics, particularly Leilan IIId type Ninevite V incised/excised sherds, otherwise un- attested in Raqd'i 4 levels. One might suggest, therefore, that the lower struc- ture and platform above it were foundations for the temple constructed on top. A problem with this hy- pothesis is the small size of the lower structure relative to the platform and temple above it, although this may simply have been the consequence of deciding to enlarge the temple after the initial foundations had been laid. Alternatively, these lower structures may be the remains of level 3 building phases earlier than the upper temple, sunk into even earlier deposits. Ceramics and chronology. The 1989 and 1990 level 3 ceramic assemblage was consistent with that of pre- vious seasons.20 Present were a small number of in- 19 The north, east, and probably west walls of the temple were aligned with the walls of this lower structure, but the temple was extended further to the south.

The excavations of level 4 brought to light a much better preserved Rounded Building than the level 3 version, whose southern portion was no longer extant. The level 4 structure was preserved up to a height of 3 m and included almost the entirety of its architectural plan, confirming the rounded shape of the building. The building constitutes two main areas. In the east was a complex of semi-subterranean, doorless rooms, the function of which was presumably storage and so are designated "silos," together with mudbrick plat- forms, and, to the north (room 18), an area with a sequence of ovens. Two rectangular mudbrick silos (rooms 19 and 20) were located next to the ovens in the north-central part of the building. A square block constructed of mudbricks was placed to the south of each silo, perhaps as a step up to the top of the structures. The easternmost of the two silos (silo 20) was filled with a profusion of cooking ware sherds. Silos in the eastern and southern parts of the build- ing had preserved segments of corbeled vaulted roofs (rooms 1, 2, 7, 21, 27, and 28). Room 1 extended down ca. 4 m and had a rectangular window in its 21 H. Weiss and L. Calderone, "The End of the Ninevite 5 Sequence at Tell Leilan," in H.

A vaulted but- tress supported the corbeled vault of the roof in the northeast corner of the room (figs. 11-12); the south- west wall had segments of a vaulted ceiling preserved in its western corner. The window, measuring 31- 39 x 31-36 cm, may have served for ventilation or to check the contents of the silo. The fill of the structure included hundreds of stone balls 3-15 cm in diameter. Located in the southwest corner of the building, room 7 had a vault of nine brick courses extending out from the northeast wall of the room, with a but- tress from the southwest wall (= the outer wall of the Rounded Building) meeting the vault at its top (figs. 13-14). The vault of room 21, in the northeast, was remarkably high, extending down from its extant top at least 1.4 m in a gradual incline; because the top course of bricks in the northern part of the structure began to show signs of cracking, excavation had to be discontinued in this area. 0 Im Vaulted Buttress Ceiling Outer Wall of Rounded Building Northeast Wall 290.89 Fig. 14.

Excavations in the western part of the Rounded Building revealed a set of rooms that included door- ways with corbeled arches. These doorways were later blocked, perhaps to facilitate the use of the rooms for additional storage space with access from above (fig. 16). Even the doorway into the building was filled in and its exterior surface plastered over. The walls of these rooms, erected against the outer wall of the Rounded Building, tended to abut one another, in- dicating several phases of architectural modification. One small room (no. 14) contained scores of clay sealings, although only two had cylinder seal impres- sions on them. One of the impressions, though frag- mentary, included a motif of concentric triangles (fig. 17).24 In another of these rooms (no. 9), a piece of painted wall plaster was found on a fragment of collapsed mudbrick in fill in the southern corner of the room.

Dunham) wall of the Rounded Building was thickened in the southeast and built over the remains of the vaulted room.27 Interpretation of the use of the building in its dif- ferent constituent parts must confront several prob- lems, particularly the issue of access from the rooms with doorways in the west to the mudbrick platforms and silos in the east. The mudbrick platforms were built directly against the rooms to the west, with their tops much higher than the room floors; perhaps ac- cess to the platforms was obtained via ladders. After the doorways to rooms 9 and 10 were blocked, access to the top of those rooms from room 13 may have been afforded by the heap of basalt cobbles found sloping against the northeast wall of room 9.28 Also of interest is the method of construction of the rounded outer wall: discrete mudbrick wall segments rectangular in plan, ranging from 1-2 m in length and width, were constructed adjacent to each other, and the space between them, wider toward the out- side, was filled in with brick fragments and mud (fig. 20). This technique appears to have been utilized in both the level 4 and level 3 phases of the building. The Rounded Building is unique for its period in Syria thus far, but parallels can be cited in the Jemdet Nasr-Early Dynastic II period round buildings from the Hamrin region of central Iraq.29 While the Ham- rin round buildings are composed of concentric cir- cles, which is not the case for the Raqa'i building, similarities include the size of the structures, the use of corbeled vaults, and the presence of mudbrick platforms and grain storage facilities. One may also compare the two clay models of round houses from mid-third-millennium Mari, which include vaulted doorways and have only one entry in the round outer wall.30 Architecture northwest of the Rounded Building (ex- cavation areas 42/120, 36/120, 36/126, 30/120, 30/126, and 29/126). Outside of the Rounded Building to the northwest was a complex of as many as six semi- subterranean "silos." Three of these were used in level 3 as well (cf. fig. 8: rooms 4-6).31 Before 1989, only the top of silo 4 had been exca- vated, exposing a large round oven taking up much of the space of the enclosure. Excavation in 1989 below the floor with this large oven revealed a subter- ranean brick silo of the same type as the adjacent silo 5. Two phases were recognizable in this structure prior to the phase of the oven. The earlier phase had an extra brick row projecting from the northwest and southeast walls of the structure. The later phase was marked by the construction of a floor of one course of mudbricks inside the silo about 1.5 m above the floor of the earlier phase, with two steps of mudbrick leading down from an opening in the wall dividing silo 4 from silo 5; this opening was subsequently blocked with mudbricks. In the fill of this phase was the upper body of a clay human female figurine, with truncated stylized arms, applied breasts, and incisions crisscrossing the body, indicating clothing or other adornment (fig. 21). In the area to the west of silos 4-6 were an addi- tional four or five adjacent semi-subterranean rectan- gular silos. One of these had a rough paving of large flat stones at its bottom, while its neighbor to the south had several large stone slabs deposited in a tumble 27 It is also notable that the level 3 Rounded Building outer wall is often wider than its level 4 predecessor. 28 Cf.

Excavation of the silo directly to the west of silo 6 revealed the lower portions of a vaulted ceiling along with vaulted buttresses in two of the room corners. In a later phase of use, this struc- ture was covered over with a mudbrick platform at least seven courses high. A stone stairway of five steps southwest of the area of the silos appears to have allowed access down into the silo complex. Small-scale rectilinear architecture was found to the south of the silo complex and included a rectangular room with lime-plastered floor, walls, and mudbrick benches built against the walls of the room, as well as a lime-plastered rectangular mud basin in the south- east corner adjacent to a ceramic vessel sunk into the floor.32 A small rectangular mudbrick enclosure to the east contained a human skull but no other bones or grave goods. This architecture was cut to the south by the level 2 terrace. Ceramics and chronology. The level 4 ceramic assem- blage (figs. 22-25), while similar to that of level 3 in its fine buff carinated cups, handmade cooking ware with crescent lugs, crude disc-shaped lids, and Nine- vite V incised pottery, also had significant differences. Particularly diagnostic was the level 4 cooking ware (fig. 22), often of a friable fabric with a crude appear- ance and including shapes such as jars with vertical or angular necks or carinated pots with short everted necks. A few examples of this ware were spouted 32 A similar plastered surface and conduit leading into a jar embedded in a courtyard surface was found in level 3, area 7, above the area of the level 4 example.</page><page sequence="16">412 GLENN M.

The motifs and shapes resemble the painted jars from Chagar Bazar that Mallowan hypothesized to be crude local imitations of painted Ninevite V33 but are probably to be associated with a painted tradition distinct from that usually designated painted Ninevite V, whose presence in the Khabur region, in any case, is relatively uncommon.34 Fine ware was rare in the level 4 sherd sample in comparison with the level 3 sample. In addition to the small cups were several examples of four-lugged jars (fig. 25.22-23).35 The few incised Ninevite V sherds included examples with simple horizontal ribbing (fig. 25.10-13) and others with more complicated mo- tifs (fig. 25.14-19). The vertical grooved pattern (fig. 25.14) is a type found in the Leilan sequence in subphase IIIc, particularly in stratum 19, early in the subphase.36 Conspicuous in their absence were sherds with zigzag or "step" excised patterns, characteristic of Raqa'i level 3 and common in Leilan IIId.37 Also significant for relative chronological purposes is a sherd from the shoulder of a large jar, found in fill near the bottom of vaulted room 7 in the Rounded Building, which had a nose-lug and two horizontal applied bands with finger impressions (fig. 25.20). Nose-lug jars with this variety of surface treatment are characteristic of Early Dynastic I in southern Mes- opotamia;38 this sherd provides an extremely rare 33 M.

Level 4, with a lengthy occupation associated with several phases outside the Rounded Building and with numerous modifications inside it, may also be tentatively synchronized with (late?) Early Dynastic I and early Early Dynastic II. Other excavated materials from level 4 include clay figurines of quadrupeds as well as fragments of hu- man figurines. Remains of clay "andirons" were found occasionally, as were clay "chariot wheels" and spindle Fig. 28. Grill architecture, levels 5-7, excavation unit 36/ 120, deep sounding, looking north whorls. Segments of basalt grinding stones were very commonly retrieved.40 Levels 5-7 The earliest remains at the site, predating the Rounded Building and deposited above virgin soil, were excavated in the 42/116-42/114 area southwest of the Rounded Building (ca. 100 m2) and in a deep sounding 2 x 7 m in area in excavation unit 36/120, northwest of the Rounded Building (fig. 26). These contexts are designated levels 5-7 to maintain consis- tency with our previously delineated seven-level sys- tem and with reference to the multiple occupations noted in the 42/116 step trench, but this should only be regarded as an interim designation.41 In both pre-level 4 areas excavated, exposed archi- tecture included grill-like structures of parallel walls 39 Cf. also M. Lebeau, "Rapport preliminaire sur la cera- mique des premiers niveaux de Mari (Chantier B-1984)," Mari 5 (1987) 417. 40 Clay human and animal figurines, spindle whorls, and fragments of model chariots and "chariot wheels" were also found in level 3. Chipped stone was common in all levels, particularly fragments or complete examples of Canaanean flint sickle blades; obsidian was very rare. Also recovered were many fragments of basalt grinding stones and a small number of fragments of copper/bronze implements. 41 The deposits of levels 5-7 extend under the outer wall of the level 4 Rounded Building, implying the original con- struction of that edifice in level 4, but an earlier, smaller version of the Rounded Building cannot be completely ruled out, since excavations to deeper levels were primarily con- ducted on the outside of the level 4 structure.</page><page sequence="20">416 GLENN M.

Roughly con- temporary examples can be cited from Telul-eth- Thalathat Tell V and Karrana 3 in northern Iraq and from Tell Madhhur in the Hamrin region of central Iraq.42 Interestingly, very limited excavations below the 4-m deep silo 1 in the level 4 Rounded Building also encountered grill-like architecture in an area of ca. 1 x 2 m. Despite repeated extensions of the excavated ex- posures of earliest contexts at Raqa'i, the retrieved sherd sample remained frustratingly small. The ma- jority of the pottery was a coarse handmade cooking ware, as had been the case in the level 4 Rounded Building. The vessels represented included hole- mouth pots and open bowls, sometimes with crescent lugs below the rim.43 This ware has also been identi- fied in contexts above virgin soil at the middle Khabur sites of Bderi and Melebiya.44 One rim sherd of a Ninevite V painted vessel, the only unequivocal example of Ninevite V painted ware at Raqa'i, was recovered outside of the grill-like ar- chitecture in 42/114 (fig. 29.1). A fragment of a sin- uous-sided fine ware bowl rim from a similar context (fig. 29.2) is comparable to "cyma recta" bowls from Amuq H, Chagar Bazar 5, and the Karababa basin of southeastern Anatolia,45 although the Raqd'i example does not have the green high-fired fabric often char- acteristic of the type. DISCUSSION The results from the 1989 and 1990 excavations at Tell al-Raqd'i allow us to expand our discussion of the site as a locus of economic specialization concerned with grain storage and processing.46 The large-scale storage facilities or silos both inside and outside the Rounded Building of level 4, comparable in size and form to the grain storage facilities identified at the nearby sites of Kerma, 2 km upstream from Raqd'i, and 'Atij, 2 km downstream, indicate a larger scale of storage at Raqd'i than previously supposed.47 That such structures were used for grain storage is dem- onstrated in particular by the results from Kerma, where large quantities of carbonized barley were found in situ in the storage facilities. Further, it is now apparent from the level 5-7 results that grain storage or processing was a focus of activity at Raqd'i from its earliest phases of occupation. Also relevant are the mudbrick platforms and ovens inside the Raqd'i 4 Rounded Building, the function of which is likely to have been connected to that of the adjacent silos and probably involved large-scale processing of the stored grain. Such processing may also be evinced by the predominance of cooking ware sherds in the fill of the Rounded Building, a pattern also observed in the contemporaneous storage facili- ties at nearby Ziyadah, on the west bank of the Khabur downstream from 'Atij.48 The ovens and mudbrick 42 S.

Since the middle Khabur salvage operation has en- tailed the excavation of at least 10 third-millennium sites, we may integrate the results from Raqd'i with those from contemporaneous excavated sites in order to acquire a regional perspective. The collection of excavated data from numerous sites within a single region is, of course, a valuable by-product of coordi- nated salvage operations. Contemporaneous third- millennium occupations with architectural and func- tional similarities to the facilities at Raqd'i are so far attested at Kerma, 'Atij, and Ziyadah. Contemporary occupation is also documented at Bderi, where a town wall and orthostat gate have been identified, and at Melebiya, Mashnaqa, Mulla Matar, and Tuneinir, in limited excavated exposures.5' The presence or ab- sence of large-scale grain storage and processing fa- cilities at the latter group of sites has not yet been ascertained.52 Because the storage facilities on the middle Khabur would have accommodated a population much larger than that manifested by the number and size of local sites, we propose that the stored and processed goods were intended to support populations external to the area.53 It has been observed that large-scale storage and processing of staples is often associated with the growth of the political and economic power of an elite employing a system of "staple finance"; in this system, staples mobilized from the commoner population are stored and used to pay for services accorded the elite such as building projects and military or craft activi- ties.54 Our working hypothesis for the middle Khabur system proposes that the middle Khabur installations were established under the auspices of developing elites in such a system, with the staples to be sent to support larger centers and elite-sponsored projects elsewhere. The question remains: which large centers or com- plex political units was the complex attached to? To the north and west were the centers of the rainfall agriculture zone of the upper Khabur such as Leilan, Brak, Chuera or Mozan, or the large "Kranzhtigel" of the area around the Jebel Abd-al-Aziz, also situated 49 G.

Kufhne in the vicinity of Tell Ajaja some 60 km downstream from Raqa'i, but the precise date of these sites within the third millennium is unclear (P. Ergenzinger, H. Kiuhne, and H.

Frank Hole ("Middle Khabur Settlement and Agriculture in the Ninevite 5 Pe- riod," Bulletin of the Canadian Society for Mesopotamian Stud- ies 21 [1991] 17-29) proposes an alternate interpretation of the middle Khabur sites, suggesting that they provided grain for a local population that included a pastoral nomadic component. While such a perspective deserves considera- tion, we hypothesize an association of the middle Khabur sites with outside larger centers or complex polities because of the scale of storage at the middle Khabur sites, the rela- tively sophisticated architecture in the Raqa'i Rounded Building and at 'Atij and Kerma, and the lack of ethno- graphic parallels for such a large-scale system associated with nomadic pastoralists. Schwartz (supra n. 50) provides a more extensive discussion of this issue. 54 T. D'Altroy and T.

CURVERS [AJA 96 within the dry farming area.55 The problem here is that the upper Khabur region is more conducive to a prosperous agricultural regime than the drier middle Khabur, where irrigation farming is a necessity. Mari on the Euphrates to the south, on the other hand, which was founded in the early third millen- nium, is in a relatively unproductive arid zone and is known to have imported large quantities of grain from the Khabur region and from Emar on the mid- dle Euphrates in the early second millennium B.C.56 One might hypothesize either a direct exploitation of the middle Khabur by Mari or postulate the middle Khabur sites as intermediary collection points for grain grown in the upper Khabur, to be processed, stored, and then shipped downstream to Mari.57 The dating of the middle Khabur complex of spe- cialized sites has been better refined through the con- tinued excavations at Raqa'i and neighboring sites, providing unexpected implications. Excavations to virgin soil at Raqd'i, 'Atij, Bderi, and Melebiya have yielded ceramic assemblages characterized by a dis- tinctive coarse cooking ware.58 At Raqa'i, these earliest ceramics must be dated to an early or middle Ninevite V phase and indicate an early third-millennium date for the founding of the site and, by extension, for the founding of Bderi, Melebiya, and 'Atij. While Ziya- dah, Mulla Matar, and Mashnaqa were settled prior to the third millennium, a lengthy gap in occupation between Halaf period and third-millennium deposits is attested at Ziyadah, and a break in occupation be- tween fourth- and third-millennium deposits has been suggested for Mulla Matar and may not be out of the question for Mashnaqa. Therefore, revived occupa- tion in the third millennium at Ziyadah, Mulla Matar, and perhaps Mashnaqa might well have occurred coincident with the earliest occupations at Raqd'i, 'Atij, Bderi, and Melebiya.59 The establishment of the middle Khabur complex of specialized sites in the early or middle Ninevite V period runs counter to expectations of the association of that complex with the development of urbanization in the Khabur triangle, thought to date to Leilan IIId, at the end of the Ninevite V period.60 If the middle Khabur sites were associated with upper Khabur cen- ters, an earlier date than the Leilan IIId period for the establishment of such centers would be called for. Such a revision of developmental models for the up- per Khabur would not be necessary, however, if the middle Khabur sites were associated with Mari, whose founding is dated by its excavator to the beginning of the third millennium.61 The demise of the middle Khabur specialized sites seems to have occurred not long after the end of the Ninevite V period. Raqa'i was abandoned after level 2 (=early Leilan II/early ED III), and Kerma and 'Atij appear to have been deserted around the same time. The larger middle Khabur sites of Melebiya and Bderi remained inhabited at least until the Akkadian period (=late Leilan II),62 but there is no evidence of their inclusion in a bulk grain storage and processing sys- tem. Explanatory hypotheses for the decline of the middle Khabur specialized system remain to be for- mulated and tested. CONCLUSIONS This review has shown that excavation of such small, rural sites as Tell al-Raqa'i can be a potent complement to urban-based archaeology, allowing for perspectives on the development of complex societies that cannot be derived from the excavation of cities. In the case of Raqa'i, we are now apprised of the mechanics of a system that appears to have concerned the provisioning of early large centers, a system of an unexpectedly large scale and sophistication. Excava- tion at such small sites as Raqa'i has also challenged traditional models of urban and rural communities; at Raqa'i, we find that economic specialization and social stratification have a rural as well as urban locus, 55 Ceramic evidence of possible Ninevite V period occu- pation has been noted on several Kranzhiigel (H.

The excavations at Raqd'i have furnished almost the com- plete plan of level 3, revealing its major constituent parts-the Rounded Building, temple, two-room houses, silos, and the industrial area--and their ar- rangement as parts of a functioning whole. Our level 4 sample, while not as exhaustive (perhaps ca. 30%), is still considerably larger than the vast majority of excavated samples acquired from urban-sized sites.64 Finally, the Raqa'i results provide a body of new data on the minimally documented Ninevite V period, furnishing what is certainly one of the largest exca- vated exposures of Ninevite V occupation available. Although the excavations at Tell al-Raqd'i have now been completed, the work of analyzing and interpret- ing the data collected is an ongoing process, and this report should be considered no more than an outline of the most obvious patterns in the data and of issues to be pursued further. Continued integration of faunal, palaeobotanical, and artifact analyses should provide fresh insights into the social and economic structuring of the site, its participation in the middle Khabur system of specialized communities, and the role of that system in the development of societal complexity in northern Mesopotamia.

Considering evidence accumulating from both the Old and New Worlds, one may note that peripheral, economically specialized out- posts were often characteristic of early complex societies. In the Hamrin region of central Iraq, for example, a set of Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic I-II period small sites dom- inated by large round buildings were probably marginal settlements established by an early state in the lower Diyala, perhaps for defensive purposes (Gibson, supra n. 29). The small (2 ha) site of Tepe Chenchi in northern Iraq, with a large public (storage?) facility dominating its mid-third mil- lennium settlement, is also interpreted as a specialized out- post of a polity centered elsewhere, perhaps at Nineveh (Algaze, supra n. 9). In the New World, settlements founded in association with new irrigation systems are well documented for the Chimu state in Peru (T. Pozorski, "Changing Priorities within the Chimu State: The Role of Irrigation Agriculture," inJ. Haas, S. Pozorski, and T. Pozorski eds., The Origins and Develop- ment of the Andean State [Cambridge 1987] 111-20). T. D'Altroy and R. Bishop note the existence of specialized agricultural communities set up by the Inka empire in its provinces, and the Inkas also established an extensive, cen- trally planned system of storage depots to support the mili- tary, corvee laborers, and other personnel (T.
