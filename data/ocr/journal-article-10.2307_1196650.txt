<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tion. All first-rate mystics have attested to this fact. And where com- munication is attempted, the language at once exceeds, yet falls short of, the definitive facts of the experience. For this reason, a scientific study of the mystical life in the author's sense is not possible. For the very na- ture of the experience takes the subject out of the realm of cognitive meanings and places it in the sphere of emotive appeals. Thus to take these testimonies as statements of factual experience is too uncritical a procedure in a study that purports to remain within the bounds of scien- tific judgment. Yet, to accomplish his purpose, the author must do exact- ly that. This, of course, explains why thoroughgoing, scientific psychologists like Leuba prefer to deal solely with the "secondary manifestations." They may be objectively studied. But then, as Professor Bastide points out, in confining their inquiry to those phases they miss the essential point of the mystical life. BERNARD E. MELAND CENTRAL COLLEGE FAYETTE, MISSOURI A STUDY IN WORSHIP This book' yields both more and less than its title seems to promise. As an exposition of the philosophy, art, or technique of worship, it leaves much to be desired; it will hardly find a place with the recent works of Sperry, Von Ogden Vogt, William Adams Brown, or Heiler's masterpiece. But it fetches a wider compass than merely a treatise on worship; it seeks a philosophy of religion. To be sure, the author modestly disclaims any pretense of formulating a theory of worship; his intention is "to depict trends" and, especially, "to create a mood for a philosophy of worship, rather than to delineate concepts" (p. 4). But the prosecution of his task carries him somewhat beyond this objective. Modem man is hungry for the experience of worship. A dozen signs of the times-the trend toward liturgy, attention to church architecture, a new literature of worship, recent developments in religious education, in religious drama and art, in philosophy-attest that hunger. It remains unsatisfied. For modern man has lost the first essentials of a satisfying faith-"full confidence and integrity." Doubt and illusion have crept in; confidence in the beliefs of the old supernaturalism has been dispelled. Without concepts which quicken the "feel of reality," "man can have neither drive nor direction." Worship is impossible. The crucial question I Modern Man's Worship: A Search for Reality in Religion. By Bernard Eugene Meland.

(See pp. I29-36.) Thus, Dr. Meland's problem is set for him-to define an objective reality in which worshipers can have intellectual confidence and to which they may render emotional devotion. In so diagnosing the predicament of the 'moder man," the author does not disguise the fact that he is portraying a personal situation. For the author a solution is found in a position which is defined as "Mystical Naturalism-natural, in the sense that I take the universe, described by the sciences, as the natural home of man, and the environ- ment in which he must fulfill his life; mystical, in the sense that I affirm the possibility of having religious relations with the Cosmic Phase of man's world" (p. xi). Such "mystical naturalism" will be achieved by a twofold recognition-"that I am a creature of earth processes" since "the earth is actually and literally the mother of us all" so that I may cultivate a profound "sense of at-homeness in the universe" (pp. 299, 142, I41); and "that the universe is such that I, as an earth creature, can set up relations with certain aspects of its life, and thus fulfill my own life processes" (p. 299). In the development of his intellectual position, Dr. Meland draws heavily from the thought of former teachers-especially Professors Wieman and Gerald Birey Smith, and, in certain guarded references, Professor Rudolf Otto. But his deeper spiritual kinship appears to be with Middleton Murry, Gamaliel Bradford, Joseph Oppenheim, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, whose sayings dot his pages. Critical scrutiny may be directed at either of two aspects of Dr. Meland's work- the concept of the object of worship which is proposed or the more general "mood" for worship which is suggested. What is the "objective reality" to which the religious aspiration of modern man is to be directed with emotional satisfaction but without loss of intellectual integrity? Is it "the whole of things" (p. I74)? Are we to take this definition quite seriously, or is it some portion or some aspect of "the whole of things" which is to be worshiped? On this, as on many of the crucial points in his theology, the author has apparently not entirely made up his mind. A little later, we are told, as we had expected, that "God is a selected portion of reality" (p. I78), and a little earlier that "God is a collective term meaning 'those most important conditions upon which human life depends'" (p. I72). But at this particular point, only a few pages distant, we are assured that worship is "deep emotional enjoyment of our relation to the total cosmic environment" (p. I74). These statements are beyond the power of the reviewer to bring into rational reconciliation. Again, it is strongly emphasized that the "sus- taining activities" which are selected to furnish content to the idea of God 33I</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION have no organic unity in themselves; they are to be recognized as "a community of activities, rather than a single behavior." And not only Whitehead, Smuts, and Morgan, but Wieman as well, comes in for criti- cism because he postulates their organic synthesis (p. I79). "It is the worshiper who unifies the many" into unity (p. I7I). But, somewhat later, the worshiper is exhorted to enter into his own solitude where-as he confronts this community of selected cosmic activities, supposedly- he will "see himself with the searching eyes of God" (p. 200). To attribute to certain processes within nature the eyes of searching personal scrutiny is a lapse into anthropomorphism from which the crudest of the old supernaturalism might well have shrunk with mortification. Equally baffling is the discussion as to whether reality is to be thought of as One or Many. "For Oneness is reality synthesized; the Many is reality analyzed" (p. I74). "Pray, then, what is reality itself?" one feels moved to inquire. Once again, according to the familiar suggestion of Pro- fessor Ames, we are urged to think of this "community of activities" which constitute "God" after the manner of Alma Mater, or the state, or the community. But the nature who is to be the object of our religious devotion is not only the sustainer and nurturer of creative and healing processes, but no less the author of earthquakes and floods and blizzards and cruel disease. To take seriously Dr. Meland's own analogy, his injunction to give whole- hearted worship to "the whole of things" is a little like inviting a nation to give unquestioning loyalty to the "family of nations" when it knows that a goodly number of the "brother nations" itch for its possessions, or urging a stranger to embrace fervently a "community" of cannibals some of whose mouths visibly water for his blood. Dr. Meland is quite right in pointing out that "neither the Theist nor the Humanist [the classical Humanist, we assume] is at home in his universe" (p. 148). And for the very good reason that this universe, when viewed with realistic insight and not through a haze of poetic imagination, can never be a deeply satis- fying habitat for a rational and sensitive spirit. Other baffling confusions and obscurities could be cited. On one page we are exhorted to cultivate "a religion and a philosophy of life that seeks facts at all costs. This is the only sound way of dealing with the circum- stances of life" (p. 254). On another page we are urged to divorce our religious devotion from our theoretical reflection and, for the former, to create through imagination a unitary Object when, in fact, there is no "objective reality to an empirical Oneness, except, of course, in religious worship" (p. I73). Again, it is asked, "What, then, is the basis of salutary religion? It is integrity-thoroughgoing integrity in one's relation to reality. It issues out of the firm conviction that one has been thoroughly 332</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL REVIEWS honest with himself in his intellectual and emotional adjustment" (p. 163). Elsewhere we are told that "assuming a theistic, or a non-theistic, atti- tude is, after all, more a matter of mood than of metaphysics" (p. I42). Here is the key to the limitations of the position developed. We are ex- horted to hold fast to facts, to rest satisfied with no attitudes in worship which have not weathered the most testing fires of thoroughgoing in- tegrity and honesty. But we are invited to create for our worship an Object which has no basis in fact, and to recognize that, after all, so fun- damental a matter as belief or disbelief in God is just a difference in mood, not an issue of truth. It may be seriously questioned whether so subjec- tive, so impressionistic a philosophy, playing jauntily with fact and with reality, is likely to feed the spiritual hunger of a generation which, what- ever its shortcomings, demands of itself and its leaders a rigorous and unrelenting realism. Dr. Meland describes his position as "mystical naturalism." It is more familiar in the records of religion as "nature mysticism." This is clearly revealed in the spiritual kinships cited above, and in the passages where the writer's deeper feeling wells into poetic phrase: "When you stand before massive uplifts of rock, mountainsides, or cascades, or before huge, high trees whose branches reach upward serenely, there is something that lifts you out of yourself" (p. 270). Here, rather than as philosopher stretching to erect a satisfying metaphysic for his rich ex- perience out of quite inappropriate and inadequate materials, he speaks freely and with moving beauty and power. His thought finds its true affinity not in naturalism but in pantheism. For him, religion is "the aesthetic attitude projected to cosmic ends-the deep, elemental, appreci- ative response of creatures toward vast and mysterious environings" (p. xiv). Few of our day have issued the old familiar invitation to lay aside the inhibitions of critical intelligence and to lift awesome wonder before the "mystery and majesty which is Nature" with such captivating and irresistible appeal. Here, as an incitement to worship rather than as a philosophy which might justify worship, is the book's strength. HENRY P.
