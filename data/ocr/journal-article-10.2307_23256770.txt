<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORWELL'S PARADOX: EQUALITY IN ANIMAL FARM BY DAVID DWAN I. INTRODUCTION "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than oth ers."1 This paradox, as Raymond Williams observed many years ago, "has passed into ordinary language."2 For Williams, George Orwell's paradox was a timeless statement about the gap between principle and practice.3 Such a disparity may say something about the inadequacies of our practices, but it just as easily raises doubts about our theories. To this extent, the true provocation in the paradox of the pigs has largely gone unnoticed: not only does it expose the false egalitarianism of a specific regime it also raises tough questions about the coherence and viability of equality as a theoretical principle. Animal Farm gives a narrative form to these problems, but the ways in which it does so have rarely been explored. Those who have examined Orwell's tale have understandably fo cused on its immediate polemical function: its damning indictment of contemporary Bolshevism.4 The tale is, of course, a transparent allegory of the fate of communism in the U.S.S.R., but it also casts its discussion on a more general level. As Orwell himself explained, "I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution. But I did mean it to have a wider application."5 Orwell's professed intentions are hardly the ultimate key to the tale's meaning, but they do emphasize a breadth of reference that is an irreducible feature of its form. By casting events as a farmyard fable, Orwell gives historical particulars a peculiarly extended life and broadens the scope of the questions the narrative raises. This generality gives the novella a special "kind of permanence" in the eyes of some, although it makes it a particularly obnoxious piece of propaganda for others, one that appears to convert the specific failings of Bolshevism into a transhistorical morality-tale about the intrinsic shortcomings of communism per se.6 It may not have been part of Orwell's polemical intention to deliver this sweeping rebuke, but it is certainly how the novella has functioned for generations of ELH 79 (2012) 655-683 © 2012 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 655</page><page sequence="2">readers.71 wish to suggest, however, that the generalities the novella trades in are more comprehensive than either its critics or advocates usually suggest. The story can be read as a criticism of any number of political ideologies—communism, liberalism, democracy—partly because it is organized around a concept that is usually fundamental to each: namely, equality. There would have been no story without this concept, but the story, I wish to argue, also puts the concept under considerable pressure. In the eyes of Martha Nussbaum, "the novel as a genre, in its basic structure and aspiration, is ... a defender of the ideal of the equality and dignity of all human life."8 Animal Farm bears out aspects of this spectacularly broad claim, but it also emphasizes the problematic char acter of equality as a general value. We learn that it is an inalienable constituent of justice, but also that it is a highly contestable principle, open to different and even rival applications. Here Orwell's paradox has real horns: different forms of equality appear grossly unequal in the light of others—a problem that is both suppressed and constituted, Orwell suggests, by the egalitarian cant of the modern world. His paradox implies that equality has become so basic to our language of legitimization (thus, in the famous phrase, "more equal" ironically implies "more deserving") that we may have forgotten what it means. Of course, it is not always clear that Orwell knew what equality meant. In "Politics and the English Language" he complained that the word was repeatedly used "dishonestly," but here he seemed to assume that its honest uses were fairly self-evident or collectively agreeable.9 Animal Farm often seems to commit itself to this bad certainty: its satire about the subversion of equality and justice can only function by assuming in advance what these concepts really mean and entail. Or at least it allows readers to do this in conjunction with the text: after all, the tale depends for its basic intelligibility on a series of intuitions or deep prejudices in its readership concerning the value and meaning of ethical concepts—not only equality, but also liberty and justice.10 These intuitions are activated by the content of the novella (the institution and subversion of animal "justice") and basic moral commitments have to be in place in the reader if even its formal identity as a tragic story or satire is to be established.11 To this extent, the tale must pander to prejudice if it is to be intelligible at all. There is nothing particularly unusual about these reading require ments and it has even been argued that such prejudice is a necessary condition of understanding in general.12 But the interpretive circle of Animal Farm may seem particularly vicious: the moral ideas it calls 656 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="3">upon and applies are so vanishingly broad—"All animals are equal" (.AF, 7) or "Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers" (.AF, 6)—that the tale manages to be both morally worthy and strangely vacuous at the same time. This problem of generality will be addressed in detail later, but it initially seems that virtually anyone can read the tale—or anyone for whom words like "equality" or "justice" are not complete anathema—and find their ethical convictions flattered and their political allegiances confirmed. Reading Orwell thus becomes an exercise in moral narcissism, which might go some way to explaining his success among such a large and diverse set of readers. Animal Farm certainly seems to meet Winston Smiths criteria for good literature—"the best books . . . are those that tell you what you know already"—but Orwell's fable also has a more skeptical energy, which troubles the very "knowledge" that it ostensibly affirms.13 The questions the novella asks about equality are in many respects basic to its structure and may even arise behind Orwell's back (as William Empson pointed out to Orwell, he had used "a form that inherently means more than the author means, when it is handled suf ficiently well").14 The fable is generally a bald narrative instrument and remains so in Orwell's hands. Nevertheless, its relatively simple formal conventions allow him to raise a series of complex issues concerning ethical concepts. The basic device of enlisting animal protagonists, for instance, immediately invites queries about the proper scope of equality: who or what does it incorporate and should it extend, for instance, to non-human animals? Characterization in Animal Farm is, as in many fables, pretty crude, but the conceptual results of its stark portraiture are interestingly mixed. On the one hand, the tale distorts character differences between humans by relating them to animal type—indeed, the vast chasm that exists between, say, natu rally clever pigs and incorrigibly stupid sheep appears to decide the case against equality before it is even tried. But the stark differences between species also put banal affirmations of equality under criti cal pressure and force readers to consider the meaning of ostensibly factual assertions that "All animals are equal." Moreover, the novella's emphasis on character helps to show how the practice of equality is not exhausted by formal procedures or rules (the limitations of rules on Animal Farm will be explored in detail), but relies on a range of everyday virtues. The plot of Animal Farm is also rudimentary, trac ing, as it does, the rise and fall of a new order and a tragic return to origins—a circular structure that may entrench assumptions that nothing really changes (this was the "reactionary bromide" Northrop David Dvoan 657</page><page sequence="4">Fiye discovered in Orwell's tale).15 But the plot also outlines a series of concrete scenarios—say, when the animals choose leaders, formulate laws, and distribute goods—that stress the situational complexity of any application of egalitarian principles. Here different contexts reveal different conceptions of equality (as a moral idea, political practice, juridical norm, or economic formula) that put the basic coherence of the general concept in some doubt. In Animal Farm, therefore, equality is as much a problem as it is an ideal. Orwell does not solve this problem, but, as Hilary Putnam suggests, the business of literature is not, it would seem, to "depict solutions"; its role may simply be to facilitate "the imaginative re creation of moral perplexities," which is already quite enough.16 Animal Farm, I shall argue, restores perplexity to some of our most hallowed and hackneyed political concepts. In doing so, Orwell shows how literature helps us to test the coherence of our values and the limits of our political imagination. II. EQUALITY AS A GENERAL PROBLEM "The whole English-speaking world," Orwell declared in 1941, "is haunted by the idea of human equality." He was convinced that the principle had never been properly realized, but he remained hope ful nevertheless: "[T]he idea is there, and it is capable of becoming a reality."17 Equality, for Orwell, was not the only political virtue (he criticized H. G. Wells for making a fetish of equality at the expense of other principles), but it was also foundational to his sense of justice.18 This commitment was hardly unique: for over two thousand years justice and equality have been commonly viewed as codependent and even synonymous. As Aristotle put it: "[W]hat is unjust is unequal, what is just must be equal—something that everyone thinks, even without argument."19 Justice, according to Aristotle, implied a prin ciple of proportion in which like things are treated alike and unalike things should be treated in proportion to their unlikeness. The prob lem with this formulation of justice lies in its broadness: it specifies a rule for respecting likeness, but it supplies no rule for determining what likeness is, although it is hard to see how this idea of similitude could ever be fixed by rules.20 The sacred commandment of Animal Farm—"All animals are equal"—is, in part, a rule that attempts to fix likeness, but, as we shall see, it tends to do this in either a circular or incomplete fashion (AF, 17). 658 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="5">As a general principle, equality seems to be radically indeterminate on two levels. First, the principle itself does not provide clues about its proper object: to what or to whom is this equality owed? (As we shall see, this is a vexed issue on Animal Farm.) Second, it is not clear what attitude or behavior the principle really enjoins. It has become a political commonplace to insist that human beings are deserving of "equal concern and respect," but respect and concern mean different things to different people.21 Indeed, for some interpreters, respect is an intrinsically restricted good and to demand its equalization is to destroy its very nature.22 The great workhorse, Boxer, is "universally respected" on Animal Farm because of some obvious inequalities: he is stronger, more virtuous, and more hardworking than others (AF, 2). The extent to which the principle of respect either demands or overrules these types of asymmetry will be considered later, but it already seems fairly clear that equality of respect does not require uniformity of treatment. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell claimed that the Party had cor rupted equality by conflating it with sameness.23 Karl Marx had raised a related point in his discussion of equal rights. By overlooking the particular circumstances of individuals, uniform rights perpetuate inequalities in the name of justice: "Right by its nature can exist only as the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are only measurable by an equal standard only insofar as they are made subject to an equal criterion."24 Here Marx conflated difference with inequality, but he plausibly suggested that the criterion through which equality is assessed is often as arbitrary as the differences it proscribes. Moreover, it frequently has deeply inequitable results. The right to rewards proportionate to one's labor, for instance, was a right to in equality: "one man is superior to another physically or mentally and so supplies more labour in the same time, or can work for a longer time" (CGP, 86). If, for instance, Orwell's Boxer—presumably Alexey Stakhanov in a horse's body—were rewarded proportionately for his labor on Animal Farm, he would soon monopolize everything. For Marx, efforts to escape such asymmetries expose the fundamental paradox of equal rights. "To avoid all these defects," he concludes, "right would have to be unequal, rather than equal" (CGP, 87). As Marx suggested, it is hard to find a specific expression of equality that does not erode the principle on some other level.25 For utilitar ians and democrats alike, equality of respect can be embodied in the formula "everyone to count as one, and nobody more than one," but David Dwan 659</page><page sequence="6">literal-minded applications of this rule easily lead to outcomes that undermine reasonable interpretations of equal respect: all may count as one under a ballot, but this formal procedure can license highly inegalitarian outcomes (it does nothing, for instance, to curb ancient fears of oppressive majorities). Nor are these problems overcome by formal guarantees of everyone's rights. Orwell took the "equality of human rights for granted," but their basic content was not transpar ent or even, perhaps, coherent.26 For instance, traditional accounts of these equal entitlements (for example, the right to property or to freedom of contract) have yielded vast asymmetries of power and wealth—a situation Orwell clearly regarded as unequal. This is not a conflict between different principles, but between rival views of a common principle (equality) and it is not immediately obvious how these differences can be resolved rationally. To put them to the vote is already to decide upon a particular conception of equality and a controversial one at that, since the very concept of voting (organized, as it usually is, around the presumption that some people might be better than others for certain roles) can be viewed as inegalitarian.27 And any other proposed procedure for resolving the issue is equally liable to prove circular. "Where there is equality there can be sanity," Winston Smith believes, but the basic coherence of equality, as a general principle, is at least open to question.28 It was certainly questioned by Marx.29 He was arguably one of equality's greatest defenders in his actual intellectual practice, but he impugned its emptiness as a theoretical notion and was critical of its incoherence as a juridical principle. He admitted that the concept of equal rights had served a purpose and he retained a reference to "equal rights" in his program for the Workers' International.30 However, he also suggested that the concept of equal right was an exhausted and even reactionary ideal.31 Frederick Engels was similarly ambivalent. He had once distinguished between different equalities and presented communism as the triumph of "real equality" over inauthentic ver sions, but he would also distance himself from such rhetoric.32 "The concept of socialist society as a realm of equality," he concluded in 1875, "is a one-sided French concept." Whatever its previous uses, it now "produced nothing but mental confusion."33 More precise for mula—such as the abolition of classes—should serve as the guiding principle of socialism, although some might wonder if this really was an advance in precision.34 660 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="7">III. ORWELL'S HOMAGE TO EQUALITY Orwell conceded that equality was a vague idea—although in a typical case of wanting it both ways, he insisted that the vagueness was a product of people's abuse of the concept. He, too, wished for a "classless society" (Engels's precise formula) but he also insisted that this was predicated on "the idea of equality."35 He acknowledged the quaintness of such beliefs, for it was "now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality" (HC, 83). His account of this trend was typically unforgiving: it had nothing to do with the intrinsic problems of equality as a concept and everything to do with the moral illiteracy of contemporary socialism. "In every country in the world," he complained, "a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy proving' that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact'' (HC, 183). For Orwell, equality was an intrinsic good and not a means to some other end such as collective wellbeing or happiness. For this reason, utilitarian arguments were inadequate: at best they treated equality as an instrumental value and harnessed it to some higher end—utility or happiness (repeated assaults on consequentialism and hedonism are a staple feature of Orwell's writing).36 Equality, he believed, was a good in itself and was its own reward. This might seem to be an overly demanding or Utopian view, but Orwell believed he had seen something like it in practice. In Spain in 1936 and 1937, he had, as he put it, "breathed the air of equal ity" (HC, 83). On his arrival in Barcelona he was awed by what he witnessed. Here the working class "was in the saddle" and social life had been transformed: In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were no "well-dressed" people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of the militia uniform. (HC, 3) Some might have found this uniformity dull or worrisome. Orwell admitted that he recoiled from aspects of Spain's egalitarian experi ment, but he also found much of it "queer and moving" (HC, 3). The apparent removal of inequalities of condition allowed for a certain equality of status: "Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Serior or 'Don' or even 'Usted'; everyone called everyone else 'Comrade'" (HC, 3). Orwell noted the David Dwan 661</page><page sequence="8">angry surprise of an army officer when he was referred to as "Senor" by an ignorant recruit: "What! Senor] Who is that calling me Senor? Are we not all comrades?" (HC, 7). Thus, even the militia system was run on egalitarian lines. As Orwell explained, the "essential point of the system was social equality between officers and men. Everyone from general to private drew the same pay, ate the same food, wore the same clothes, and mingled on terms of complete equality" (HC, 26). Orwell initially wondered about the viability of this system of rule and for good reason. Military discipline did not exist; troops were of ten clueless about the methods and objectives of the war; many were incapable of standing in line and "if a man disliked an order he would step out of the ranks and argue with the officer" (HC, 7). He later insisted that dissent could be overcome not by punishments but by ap pealing to dissenters in the name of "comradeship" (HC, 27). This put a considerable burden on the idea of solidarity and it reflects Orwell's difficulties in challenging a stubborn cliche of political thought: that military effectiveness presupposed a hierarchical system of rule. Orwell attempted to argue that democratic armies were structured around fellowship not fear and were consequently more efficient—although efficiency was not the primary reason why equality should be espoused. Spain was the closest Orwell had come to a concrete instantiation of socialist ideals. On the Aragon front traditional class distinctions seemed to have lost their purchase and many "of the normal motives of civilised life—snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.—had simply ceased to exist." "In theory," he concluded, "it was perfect equality and even in practice it was not far from it" (HC, 83). These egalitarian practices were not, however, problem-free. For a start, equality frequently clashed with other important principles. He was adamant that egalitarian ideals should trump values such as utility, but he was less certain about their relationship to other goods such as liberty. Orwell often assumed that equality and liberty were codependent, but a minimalist rendering of liberty as an absence of constraint shows that they are not necessarily so and were certainly not so in Spain.37 In Barcelona, it was clear that equality imposed considerable constraints on the liberty of some even if it proved emancipating for others. His ambiguous assurances that the "wealthy classes had ceased to exist" and his casual observations that "churches were wrecked and the priests driven out or killed" were symptomatic of the problem (HC, 190). Spain also exposed tensions within the concept of equality itself. The fierce disputes between socialist and anarchist groups in Barce 662 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="9">lona were a product of disorganization and petty rivalries as much as principle; they also owed much, Orwell insisted, to the malevolence of external agents such as the U.S.S.R. But the factionalism arose, too, from competing interpretations of equality or—what often appeared to be the same thing—rival views of how it should be put into practice. The government in Barcelona defended its democratic mandate to rule; its critics on the left dismissed democracy in its current form as a hollow or even reactionary practice. Contemporary forms of democ racy did not leave Orwell dewy-eyed and when he crudely sketched the anarchist arguments against its "bourgeois" forms ("Bourgeois 'democracy' is only another name for capitalism, and so is Fascism") it was hard to see where his sympathies lay (HC, 203). He always remained convinced of the argument that significant inequalities of condition made genuine political equality impossible. But the removal of economic inequalities seemed to require a centralized administration that strained against democratic commitments to the equalization of power.38 The example of the Soviet Union did little to soothe Orwell's worries on this score, nor were events in Spain entirely reassuring. And while he continued to believe in the capacity of English citizens "to centralise their economy without destroying freedom," his last two novels appear to express some doubts about their abilities to do so.39 So Barcelona had come close to embodying Orwell's idea of "per fect equality," but it also revealed imperfections in the ideal: it was a radically indeterminate concept, open to different and rival interpreta tions. The radical ambiguity of the principle is evident on the very first page of Hoinage to Catalonia. Here Orwell meets an Italian militia man and is instantly drawn to him: "Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! It was as though his spirit and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf of language and tradition and meeting in utter intimacy" (HC, 2). Arguably, this solidarity is expressive of Orwell's belief in the moral equality of human beings—an equality that cuts across social differences and expresses a respect for persons as persons. The scene seems to set the terms for everything else in the book just as the human solidarity it celebrates will serve to ground more elaborate conceptions of equality that will be fought for in Spain. Yet, economic and political equalities often pull in different direc tions and the moral equality that presumably underpins them can seem highly tenuous. Its fragility is borne out by Orwell's portrait of the militiaman. Not all solidarity, the description suggests, is egalitarian: David Dwan 663</page><page sequence="10">He was standing in profile to me, his chin on his breast, gazing with a puzzled frown at a map which one of the officers had open on the table. Something in his face deeply moved me. It was the face of a man who would commit murder and throw away his life for a friend. . . . There were both candour and ferocity in it; also the pathetic reverence that illiterate people have for their supposed superiors. Obviously he could not make head or tail of the map; obviously he regarded map reading as a stupendous intellectual feat. I hardly know why, but I have seldom seen anyone—any man, I mean—to whom I have taken such immediate liking. (HC, 1) This portrait may reflect an "immediate liking," but it is hard to say that it conveys equality of respect. Orwell's rhetorical phrenology is neither subtle nor kind and even the loyalty that he projects onto a face is morally ambiguous: murderous partisanship for a friend may easily preclude the notion of universal respect. Nor is respect much in evidence in the account of the mans stupidity and the adverbial insistence on its obviousness says much about the dogmatism of the narrative voice and little about its object. Orwell is contemptuous of the mans "pathetic reverence" for his supposed superiors, but such con tempt is arguably expressive of the hierarchies it ostensibly condemns. Orwell's point may be that social hierarchies breed real differences but that this has no bearing on the moral equality of human beings. However, the equality invoked here is also extremely abstract: it may call for universal respect lor persons as persons, but human beings are usually embodied agents, operating in concrete circumstances and distinguished by differences in character and condition—once these differences are bracketed out there may be very little left of persons. What's left of the militiaman, we might ask, once his social identity and "fierce pathetic face" have been removed (HC, 2)? The equality yielded by such abstraction is arguably destitute of all content. Orwell almost acknowledges the superficial nature of the solidarity this yields when he indicates that the restrictions on his relationship with his newfound friend are also its conditions of success: "I hoped he liked me as well as I liked him. But I also knew that to retain my first impression of him I must not see him again" (HC, 2). Homage to Catalonia raises troubling questions, therefore, about the equality it sponsors. The same issues reappear in Animal Farm in a more vexatious form. By shifting his focus to animals in this novella, Orwell puts his own humanism under pressure. Here he implicitly raises a question that cuts across his entire oeuvre: to what extent is it right or even meaningful to demand equality for human beings qua human 664 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="11">beings? It remains to be seen whether this demand yields something more than circular thinking and empty moralism.40 IV. EQUALITY AND HUMANITY Equality appears in Animal Farm as both a statement of fact and as a value.41 All animals are equal we are told—a description of how things are and a rule or "commandment" about how things ought to be (AF, 17). Both the descriptive statement and the rule are seem ingly complementary, but they can also pull against each other. The demand that animals should be treated equally seems to imply that they are not at present equal, which raises questions about the factual claim that ostensibly grounds the norm.42 Indeed, it is not immediately obvious what equality construed as a fact actually means, outside of the simple tautology that animals are animals. On any more determinate set of criteria, a factual assertion of equality amongst animals seems to be blatantly false. It is obvious, for instance, that pigs are cleverer than sheep or ducks. Boxer, as we have seen, is stronger than all and if he is more stupid than pigs ("he was not of first-rate intelligence"), he is also, it would seem, more virtuous (AF, 2). For these reasons, "he was the admiration of everybody"—there is no equality of esteem here, just as there is no equality of intelligence, strength, motivation, virtue, or any other identifiable good on Animal Farm (AF, 20). Beaders may feel that Orwell stacks the argument against equality by exaggerat ing natural inequalities and distorting their basis. How natural these attributes are, after all, is open to question—a point to which I will return.43 But whatever the origins, ontological status, or legitimacy of the differences between animals on Animal Farm, they make the factual assertion of equality between them difficult to decipher. Even the definition of an animal is not straightforward in the new republic and so the scope of equality is unclear. In the end, the animals rely on a simple friend-enemy distinction to designate the object of egalitarian concern—an arbitrary arrangement and the result, perhaps, of transferring the concept of class warfare to human-animal relations. But the essential principle of Animalism—"Four legs good, two legs bad"—is unsettling to some. When the birds of the farm query this maxim, Snowball tries to provide reassurance: "A bird s wing comrades,' he said, 'is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The distinguishing mark of Man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief"' (AF, 24). David Dwan 665</page><page sequence="12">This is a joke about legal and political hair-splitting, but it also raises a more genuine issue of determining the precincts of moral obliga tion. To whom or to what is duty owed? The anthropomorphism of Orwell's fable seems to rebound upon itself and raises questions about traditional distinctions between animals and humans. The line drawn by the animals is wholly arbitrary and parodies the moral parochialism of human beings. The parody may be inadvertent: while much has been made of Orwell's love of animals, it is also well known that he loathed vegetar ians and related do-gooders (the "food-crank is by definition a person willing to cut himself off from human society in hopes of adding five years onto the life of his carcase; that is, a person out of touch with common humanity" [WP, 162]). Nevertheless, Boxer is a poor adver tisement for the knackers' yard and even the pigs may make us think of the moral price of bacon. The problem of animal welfare is implicit in Orwell's own account of the book's origins: The actual details of the story did not come to me for some time until one day (I was then living in a small village) I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat. (AF, 118) Some philosophers have interpreted Orwell's slogan—"All animals are equal"—on a literal level and have gone on to compare human centric views of morality as morally equivalent to racism and sexism.44 But it is very hard to see how Orwell would have admitted to this. To assume that there is an innate white person's view of the world or to conclude that a darker skin color makes one "a different kind of animal" is to be prejudiced in Orwell's eyes. He was not immune from this type of prejudice himself, but he did speak out against a type of "racialism" that sanctioned the oppression of others by assum ing that "the exploited are not human beings."45 However, to believe that there is a human perspective that animals cannot possess is, for Orwell, to subscribe to the obvious. He may have felt that a concern for animals was built into a human view of the world (so if kindness is fundamental to a normative conception of humanity, animals might easily be the beneficiaries of this expectation), but outside of Animal Farm he did not use the language of equality to make sense of these obligations (in other words, our reasons for being kind to animals do 666 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="13">not necessarily stem from our being equal to them). And when the assertion of animal equality in the novella is interpreted too literally the tales broader allegorical function collapses. Orwell did think that it made sense to use the language of equality about humans—indeed, he seemed to believe that the demand to treat others as equals was built into a human point of view. Here the word "human" operated ambiguously as both a normative and descriptive concept. Orwell was sometimes dismissive of the evaluative proper ties of the word "human": it lacked a clear and distinct referent and was therefore, he concluded, essentially meaningless—although this would presumably hold for virtually all moral concepts.46 Fortunately, he never felt bound by such a reductive theory of meaning and made copious use of the word. He advocated a "fully human life," praised somewhat unctuously the "deeply human" (WP, 108) atmosphere of working-class homes, and distinguished between "a human and inhuman world" (WP, 204).47 "Human beings were trying to behave as human beings," he noted approvingly in Spain (HC, 4), while the moral object of his hero Winston Smith "was not to stay alive but to stay human."48 Here the word "human" meant many things—so many things that it might seem to mean nothing at all. Yet Orwell's rhetoric of the human grounded his belief in equality: the principle was intrin sic to the idea of a "common humanity" and set the terms for more systematic accounts of egalitarian values (WP, 162). Thus, the key tenet of Animalism—"All animals are equal"—is really a coded form of humanism, although perhaps this is not to say much in its favor.49 Obvious suspicions arise from Orwell's use of the word "humanity" as a moral standard: no values concerning humans, it might be said, can be derived from the simple fact of their being human. Others might find it vexingly circular to ask humans to behave as humans. Orwell's human-talk was often vague and platitudinous, but it was not, I shall suggest, completely empty.50 Nor was his use of humanity as both a fact and a value a logical mistake. After all, it is difficult to separate facts and values when it comes to humans, because their values—say, their desire for others or their pursuit of reasons—are so often con stitutive of what they are, that is, social and rational animals (although Orwell's virtually arational militiaman might quarrel with even these categorizations). Few writers had a more vivid sense of pain than Orwell, but again it is sometimes hard to tell whether the ascription of pain describes a fact or a value. Internal to the very experience of pain, one might argue, is an evaluation of its horror.51 The assertion that pain lacks David Dwan 667</page><page sequence="14">this intrinsic significance and needs a grammar to give it meaning may merely point to a union of fact and value on a different level.52 Such difficult matters cannot be properly settled here, but Orwell seemed to believe, at any rate, that human beings were united in their capacity for suffering and that one could derive a strong sense of their values from this basic fact.53 Thus, all humans are equal in some basic respects: they will value food, shelter, and security in a broad sense. He was sometimes extremely crude about the nature of these values (a "human being is primarily a bag for putting food into" [WP, 84]), although he would also criticize vulgar hedonists for reducing man to a "walking stomach" (WP, 184). Orwell was hardly the first to note humanity's shared capacity for suffering or to see in this a basic form of equality. For thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, our universal vulnerability to injury was the basis of our natural equality.54 In the state of nature, all are equally vulner able to the aggression of all. This makes security a goal for everyone, but—notoriously—the goal can only be achieved if natural equality is relinquished. Orwell never seemed to entertain the idea that equality could or should be alienated like this and he also insisted that security could be fetishized in ways that were clearly self-undermining (in Animal Farm the repeated invocation of Jones as a threat to the se curity of all guarantees the tyranny of the pigs). He did seem to think that humanity as a moral ideal was built upon the avoidance of suf fering, but this was only a negative construction of the demands our nature imposes. A more positive view depended not on the supposed opposite of pain such as pleasure (as we have seen, Orwell distrusted hedonistic accounts of the good), but on "a moral quality which must be vaguely be described as decency."55 His praise of "common decency" (WP, 164) or "ordinary decency" can sound extremely parochial—a very English decency defended by a jolly good chap—but Orwell meant something more comprehensive by the notion: it implied a respect for human beings as moral agents.56 He never presented this as a fully-fledged theory, yet it remained latent in his repeated use of thick concepts such as "decency" and "human ity." Human beings were moral agents in so far as they were free and a respect for this freedom entailed that they could only be coerced by reasons to which they could, in principle, agree. Such agreement required "intellectual decency" or "mental decency"—an outlook that extended equal respect to the reason and freedom of all.57 As we shall see, Orwell's faith in the will and reason of all would waver badly and his various accounts of treacherous intellectuals and their stupid 668 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="15">victims (of which Animal Farm is arguably a supreme example), point to the limits of his own decency (already pretty evident in his portrait of the militiaman) as much as they stress shortcomings in the general concept. Yet it is hard to conclude that he ever fully abandoned his commitment to "decency in the conduct of government" and the moral equality it both guaranteed and presupposed.58 The type of equality that Orwell derived from our freedom as moral agents or our suffering as embodied creatures was extremely general and on a whole range of fronts it was hopelessly vague. Yet it was all too easy to think of situations in which the principle of humanity, or the moral equality it presupposed, was systematically transgressed. He regarded Nazism, for instance, as an attack on the very principle of humanity. The belief "that human beings are all one species of animal," he concluded, "totalitarianism destroys." Nazism was a systematic form of "inequality."59 In Orwell's eyes, it was "precisely the idea of human equality . . . that Hitler came into the world to destroy."60 In these political contexts, Orwell's defense of "common humanity" was neither trivial nor empty, although some of his contemporaries on the left might have deemed it so. For some socialist thinkers, the type of equality presupposed by the idea of a common humanity was unhelpfully abstract and merely served to disguise real clashes of interest. As Marx had famously put it, "all classes melt away before the solemn concept of 'humanity.'"61 Orwell was alive—but not entirely immune—to the problems of humanist cant and the empty moralism it yielded. "A humanitarian is always a hypocrite," he once insisted: such a figure defends the abstract freedom of everyone whilst ignoring and often benefiting from the real—usually economic—restrictions on its universal enjoyment.62 However, this bad faith was not logically entailed by language of humanism; indeed, the reverse would seem to be true, which is why Orwell's humanitarian is a hypocrite, a figure living at odds with his own values. Yet it is difficult to see what exactly the moral equality of humans necessarily entails. Orwell assumed that it presupposed political, social, and economic equality, but this is not necessarily the case and, as we have seen, it is not obvious that these equalities are fully compatible. He insisted, nonetheless, that it was the role of justice to defend equality. Yet, as Animal Farm demonstrates, the precise content of this justice was far from obvious. David Dwan 669</page><page sequence="16">V. EQUALITY AS UNIVERSALITY In Animal Farm equality is guaranteed by the rule of law. The Seventh Commandment—"All animals are equal"—is, in a sense, the law of laws and outlines both the motive and the form of justice. The motive of the law comes from the fact that animals are moral equals and this equality is embedded in the form of the law, namely its universal character. Thus the law is equally inclusive of everyone. But Orwell immediately raises questions about the sufficiency of these laws: only some animals get to formulate the law, only the clever can remember it, and "the stupider animals such as the sheep, hens and ducks are unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart"—a skill that is itself not a very good measure of legal understanding (AF, 24). This unequal grasp of the law exposes the inadequacy of the formal equality the law enshrines. It certainly helps the pigs to break the rules or to modify them for their corrupt purposes. Thus the law itself becomes the instrument of arbitrary power. So in Animal Farm Orwell seems to record his doubts about the sufficiency of law as a guarantor of equality. He always found it difficult to believe that law was a mere super-structural expression of relations of power, but he felt that there were deep inequities in the application of justice. "Everyone knows," he declared in 1941, "that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor." He disparaged the English for conflating the law, which was often "stupid and cruel," with morality; at the same time, he admired their "respect for constitutionalism and legality." Above all, he applauded an English confidence in the im partiality of the law: everyone believed "that the law can be, ought to be, and, on the whole, will be impartially administered."63 In Animal Farm, however, the pigs both exploit and negate this shared belief in the impartiality of justice. In their trotters, the law becomes an instrument of oppression. Yet if interpreters are to understand the iniquity of the pigs, they must hold the assumption that justice should be impartial or equal. And for justice to be equal, it must be universal: a rule for one is a rule for all. It is striking how little needs to be said about this within Animal Farm. Indeed, the often spare and seemingly non-committal features of the narrative voice merely emphasize the commitments readers bring to the text on this issue. Admittedly, the narrator helpfully notices injustices (like the shirking of work by some or the stealing of goods by others) and this focalization is arguably itself an implicit normative judgment; yet explicit inferences about the injustice of these acts and the reasons for deeming them so are generally avoided. Here read 670 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="17">ers must enact their own commitment to the principle of universality and the equality it presupposes: they easily intuit, for instance, that the pigs, the cat, and the vain mare all act unfairly when the exempt themselves from the universal scope of the moral law. These creatures repeatedly treat themselves as exceptions in ways that break the Sev enth Commandment and regard their own ends as unequal compared to the ends of others. The very form of Orwell's fable, I have suggested, gets us to think in a general key and the story, as a whole, helps us to recognize that an ability to think generally—or in universal terms—is a prerequisite for treating people equally. Indeed, parts of Orwell's novella can be read as a Kantian morality tale in ways that emphasize how far this sense of universality shapes our sense of justice. In order to enshrine a type of equality that was compatible with freedom, Immanuel Kant asked us to submit our actions to certain tests. He asked us to imagine a rule for an action, which everyone could freely follow and choose to apply, and in a further step he asked us to imagine the universal observation of that rule. If this could be done without self-contradiction, then the action was permissible.64 Fortunately enough none of Orwell's animals set themselves these arcane exercises. And yet, the paradox of the pigs brilliantly emphasizes how far equality-as-universality is fundamental to our sense of moral coherence. Clearly their iniquity cannot be coher ently formulated into a universal law of nature for it breaches the most fundamental feature of all justice—the formal equality of law itself. Indeed, on the basis of this paradox, some born-again Kantians might be encouraged to think that all iniquitous actions on Animal Farm would yield contradictions when universalized and would violate—however indirectly—the precept that all animals should be viewed as equals. Actions, however, are not propositions and only the latter strictly yield contradictions. And while we might try to construct maxims for certain proposed actions in order to see where their universalization would lead us, it is clear that our deeds are not self-interpreting and lend themselves to different descriptions or maxims. Even if Mollie accompanied her behavior with a specific statement—it is right that I remain idle while others work—the univerzalisation of this claim is not logically incoherent. And yet some Kantian animals might say that it points to a practical contradiction: if idleness became the universal norm, the practice "work" would disappear on Animal Farm. Here Mollies maxim would not even make sense. Her idleness can only be properly enjoyed if it is the rule for other people to work. David Dwan 671</page><page sequence="18">This means that Mollie effectively wills two contradictory things: that work is a binding rule and that it is not binding. Mollie s double standard violates the form of the law, for it cannot be coherently uni versalized, and it breaches the motive of the law—her own needs take priority over the equal consideration of others. Her idleness, therefore, transgresses the equality that is fundamental to Animal Farm. The same holds true of the pigs. They repeatedly lie in ways that seem deeply unfair on an intuitive level, but these intuitions can be sharpened into something more philosophically explicit. Once again the double stan dard of the pigs reveals a practical contradiction: the very concept of lies is parasitic on the practice of truth-telling. If lying were universal, the practice of truth would break down and even the notion of lying would not make sense. Thus the universalization of a maxim in favor of lies would be incoherent both in its conception and as a form ol volition: in order for lies to work, the pigs must will that animals are ruled by truth and not ruled by truth. In this arbitrary commitment to truth, they prioritize their own ends over those of others. All this sounds like a very Kantian fairy tale in which justice as universalizability holds a special role. But the ingenious proposals of Orwell's pigs also put this conception of justice under pressure. The strong links between equality, universality, and fairness may explain why some rules on the farm, like the prohibition against killing, may initially seem right to readers: the rule guarantees an equal right to life and can be universalized without contradiction. However, its opposite—a rule sanctioning killing—initially seems to survive the test of universaliza tion. Life in a state of universal war may be nasty, brutish, and short, but it is not unthinkable—some have imagined it in detail.65 In any event, a rule that precluded all killing might easily be regarded as too strong; some killing may possibly be justified, say, in self-defense or in the resistance of tyranny. Thus, readers might doubt the virtue of the pigs, whilst essentially agreeing with the content of their modified rule—"No animal shall kill any other animal without cause" (AF, 66). Whatever the particular merits or evils of this rule, it brilliantly captures the limits of universalizability as a criterion of justice. The test it sets for our norms is either too strong in what it prohibits or too weak in what it allows. The dangerous supplement of the pigs ("with out cause") suggests that a host of rules can be universalized if they are made sufficiently indeterminate and can even license exceptions to themselves. Such rules expose the limits of what rules can achieve. They also demonstrate that universality does not exhaust the idea of justice. Indeed, many of the rules on the farm—"No animal shall wear 672 Ortvell's Paradox</page><page sequence="19">clothes," "No animal shall sleep in a bed," or "No animal shall drink alcohol"—can be universalized without self-contradiction (AF, 17). But so, too, can their opposites. The institution of private property, which the animals ostensibly bring to an end, is easily universalizable, but they do not regard it as just. When Kant asked us to imagine what the universalization of a rule would look like, he showed how acts of imagination are fundamental to moral understanding. But Orwell imagined a series of moral sce narios that easily expose the limits of the Kantian imagination and the type of justice it envisions. However necessary, the universalizable feature of a law is an insufficient indication of its justice. Moreover, substantive issues of equality cannot be settled by this principle alone. This pertains especially to idea of distributive justice—an idea that is central to Animal Farm. But here again Orwell imagines a number of scenarios that put some classical theories of distributing social goods fairly under pressure—capitalism seems to be dismissed from the very outset of Animal Farm, but as the tale develops some of Marx's recommendations are also found wanting. VI. EQUALITY AND DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE In his preface to the Ukrainian edition of the novella, Orwell indicated that he had attempted "to analyze Marx's theory from the animals' point of view" (AF, 119). It is not obvious what theory Orwell had in mind, nor is it even evident that he had a comprehensive grasp of Marxist doctrine.66 Old Major is, it would seem, a porcine Marx, but it is doubtful that the real Marx would have given unqualified support to the pig's teachings. "All animals are equal," Old Major maintains; however, as we have seen, Marx criticized equality for being vague in conception and often incoherent in its application. In his Critique of the Gotha Program, he condemned the idea of equal right as a distributive principle, but he also endorsed an alternative theory of what is called distributive justice even though he recoiled from the idealistic odor of terms such as "fair distribution" (CGP, 84). Here he reiterated Louis Blanc's famous phrase: "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs!" (CGP, 87). This powerful recommendation seems to guarantee equal respect and consideration, whilst accommodating the differences between individuals and their circumstances. It is also the credo of Animal Farm. We repeatedly hear that the animals are "all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak" (AF, 64). The contribution of the hens David Dwan 673</page><page sequence="20">and the ducks at harvest-time is modest (they save five bushels of corn by gathering up stray grains), but it is proportionate to their abilities. In theory, at least, each animal is rewarded according to its needs. Orwell does much to highlight the moral substance and efficiency of this distributive system: it initially yields "the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen" and the animals find themselves "happy as they had never conceived it possible to be" (AF, 20). But he also raises some of the classical objections to the practice of grounding distribution on relative need. While this may seem to be an efficient and fair system in theory, the actual content of these needs is not self evident. The pigs, for instance, can invoke the language of necessity for corrupt ends—"Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig" (AF, 25). Readers easily dismiss this as nonsense, but it shows that needs are not self-interpreting. Moreover, the principle of need tells us little about how to distribute a broad range of goods—social or political honors or items such as ribbons, alcohol, or sugar. These goods are superfluous to need, but precisely for that reason they raise key problems about the criteria for fair distribution on Animal Farm. The corrupting effect of luxury is, of course, an ancient theme of political thought and the animals are alert to the ways in which opulence can aggravate desire, enervate citizens, spawn inequality, and erode the social bond. They inaugurate a series of sumptuary laws—"No animal shall wear clothes"; "No animal shall drink alcohol," and so forth—in an effort to restrict appetites to needs. Old Major prohibits trade for the same reason: this would supplant a production based on needs with values mediated by exchange. This autarkic experiment is soon abandoned in an effort to secure raw materials for the windmill—a key component of the electrification program. This is an obvious ref erence to Soviet trade agreements that had been in operation since 1921, but it also does some broader conceptual work, foregrounding the difficulties of aligning production with brute need. A further problem with a needs-based form of distribution is that it fails to accommodate notions such as desert (to simply identify need with desert is not to solve the problem but to repress it). The system on Animal Farm is certainly vulnerable to abuse by free riders such as Mollie and the incorrigible cat ("It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened" [AF, 21]). The animals seem to accept this abuse stoically enough—necessarily 674 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="21">so, perhaps: if desert is not a criterion for reward, it is not one for censure—but they also acknowledge that work is not its own reward. Orwell never entertains Marx's suggestions that work would become a direct pleasure and expressive need—"not only a means of life but life's prime want"—in the communism of the future (CGP, 87). On Animal Farm it is "an acute positive pleasure" (AF, 20) to consume the product of one's labor, but work is still a drudge (the campaign for electricity is a bid to reduce "sordid labour" [AF, 38]), while "leisure" remains a coveted good (AF, 20). Snowball duly proposes a technological fix: "fantastic machines . . . would do their work for them while they grazed on the fields or improved their minds with conversation" (AF, 35-36). It thus appears that neither equality nor solidarity has sufficient motivational force on Animal Farm; other incentives are required. This problem is implicitly acknowledged in the honors system on the farm. After the Battle of the Cowshed, Snowball and Boxer are awarded the title "Animal Hero, First Class," whilst the decoration "Animal Hero, Second Class" is conferred posthumously on the dead sheep (even in glory, the sheep always remain an inferior type of beast on Animal Farm [AF, 32]). Orwell is obviously parodying the Soviet awards system— the Order of the Bed Banner given to Leon Trotsky for his defense of Petrograd or the numerous honors given to Stakhanov—but these new titles raise general questions about the general limits of equality and its relationship to ideas of merit. Even famous critics of inequality such as Jean-Jacques Bousseau had stressed the need for civic distinctions based on services to the state. Bousseau spoke of two types of equality: one which indifferentiy distributes advantages to all and another which is based on merit. The state, he suggested, has need of both systems.67 Animal Farm also deploys these two forms of equality, although it is not clear if each system marks the corruption of the other. Orwell clearly indicates that the honors system is open to abuse. Napoleon confers several titles upon himself ("Animal Hero, First Class" and "Animal Hero, Second Class") and soon other distinctions are introduced: other animals must stand aside for pigs on public paths and pigs get to wear ribbons on Sundays (AF, 61). These distinctions have ostensibly nothing to do with merit, although the corruption of the merit system should not obscure the fact that need is not the only distributive norm on Animal Farm; nor, perhaps, should it be. Indeed, the famous principle "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs" is not one simple command; it sanctions, David Dwan 675</page><page sequence="22">in fact, two distinct—and potentially dissonant—distributive criteria.68 It demands that social resources should be shared according to needs, but it also calls for social roles to be aligned with abilities—arguably a meritocratic principle of distribution. The request for input from all that is proportionate to the capacities of each may seem a fair and efficient form of social organization, but, as Animal Farm indicates, it also has some worrisome downsides. For instance, it yields an almost Platonic—and deeply elitist—set of social arrangements on the farm. Plato had recommended the distribution of social roles according to natural aptitude ("each individual should follow, out of the occupations available in the city, the one for which his natural character best fitted him") and had consequently defended a strict division of labor in his ideal republic. Thus, if you are naturally disposed to shoemaking, you should stick to making shoes—indeed, "doing one's own job, and not trying to do other people s jobs for them, is justice" in Plato's eyes.69 The creatures on Animal Farm also have natural traits and talents, which equip them for certain occupations. But since leadership is one such role the political outcomes of a strict division of labor are fraught. The pigs constitute a natural aristocracy: "With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership" (AF, 19). It is difficult to tell if the perceived naturalness of this decision is endorsed or merely reported by Orwell's narrator, but the natural ness of basic abilities is a structural feature of the narrative as a whole. For commentators like T. S. Eliot, there was nothing essentially wrong with the farm's hierarchical structure of rule: the pigs simply needed to supplement their superior knowledge with a superior virtue, but a government of the wise and the virtuous is not necessarily a govern ment of equals for equals.™ In his account of naturally intelligent pigs, Orwell downplays the social character of certain goods. Indeed, he tends to distort human traits and to exaggerate their biological character when he relates differences between individual humans to different species of animal. After all, intelligence is as much a social practice as it is a natural trait and the practice is more variegated than his fable sometimes sug gests. Orwell reifies cleverness and attributes this essential property to pigs in ways that repress how cognitive skills are, in part, socially constituted. Clearly, goods such as intelligence dictate a basic division of labor ("We pigs are brainworkers") on the farm, but by naturalizing the constitution and distribution of these goods, Orwell represses the possibility that they may be—at least in part—the product of such a division (AF, 25). This possibility had haunted figures such as Adam 676 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="23">Smith, and while Smith presented the division of labor as the engine of civilization in the Wealth of Nations, he also worried that it led to "corruption and degeneracy," rendering workers wholly unfit for "rational conversation."71 Since this type of stupidity is socially constituted, the distribu tion of intelligence already raises questions of social justice—a point repeatedly emphasized by Marx in his criticisms of the division of labor. Marx acknowledged that both the specification and delegation of function "develops spontaneously or 'naturally' by virtue of natural predisposition," but he also insisted that it shaped the personality of man, usually for the worse (it "turns man as far as possible into an abstract being, a machine tool, etc., and transforms him into a spiritual and physical monster").72 Presumably, this is why he suggests that the division of labor must be transcended before the distributive principle of communism—"from each according to his abilities"—can fairly apply, although his earlier account of this transcendence (where one hunts in the morning, fishes in the morning, rears cattle in the evening, and criticizes after dinner) reads like an extravagant hope rather than a plausible prediction.73 Nevertheless, Marx's criticisms of the division of labor help to emphasize the complacency of Goldstein's account of modern social development in Nineteen Eighty-Four-, it "was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favored some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth."74 The specialization and delegation of function—as James Burnham pointed out—often served to recast rather than obliterate distinctions of class and allowed for the indirect monopolization of wealth by concentrating power in the hands of managerial elites. Burnham's account of a "new structure ol class rule" over which a tyranny of mangers presides was a histrionic restatement of established concerns about the oligarchical cast of modern social structures.75 Orwell criticized the fatalism of Burnham's thesis, but he was clearly influenced by its bleak diagnosis, as the managerial tyrannies of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four attest.76 As we have seen, Orwell exaggerated the natural character of cer tain abilities or traits in Animal Farm and thus repressed the political significance of the inequalities they sanction. However, his account of the entrenched character of these differences in native ability and social function usefully dispels romantic hopes that the specialized character of modern social organization can simply be sloughed off David Dwan 677</page><page sequence="24">in the communism of the future. By the same token, Orwell also queries the meritocratic prejudices of modern times. To make abil ity or competence the sole criterion for distributing social roles is to risk undermining equality, however it may purport to advance other conceptions of this good (free and open competition presented, say, as equal opportunity). As Animal Farm powerfully illustrates, the first clause on communism's banner—"from each according to his abili ties"—is not necessarily benign. As a distributive principle, it leads to huge asymmetries of power and status and these inequalities are not held in check by the second principle ("each according to his needs"). Throughout the course of a deceptively simple fable, therefore, Orwell puts a number of distributive models to the test. The distribu tion of goods on the basis of needs has a clear moral force, but the content and limits of these needs are not self-evident (as the apple monopolizing, milk-thieving pigs demonstrate). The principle of need is clearly insufficient when it comes to a range of simple goods such as ribbons and social roles such as political leadership. Perhaps a te leological conception of the human animal as a zoon politikon would render political participation or a stake in leadership a human need, but otherwise it is hard to see how this question can be directly ac commodated under the notion of needs. Here modern societies usually invoke an abilities principle or a concept of merit, based on actual or presumed competence. But, as Orwell shows, the fetishization of competence sanctions huge imbalances of power in public life and seriously jeopardizes equality of respect. Of course, for some, respect also is a meritocratic concept and to insist upon its equalization is to lose sight of the fact that it should be earned. But a world that oper ated in this way would be a fairly unforgiving place and even Orwell had difficulties imagining it. On his farm even free riders are shown tolerance and respect by others, although how equal this respect is or should be remains a vexed question. VII. CONCLUSION "Socialism," Orwell declared in The Road To Wigan Pier, "is such elementary common sense that I am sometimes amazed that it has not established itself already." Orwell never dropped his conviction that socialism was a simple matter of executing justice and the nature of that justice seemed to him largely self-evident: 678 Orwell's Paradox</page><page sequence="25">The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all co-operate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions, seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless they had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system. (WP, 159) Here and elsewhere Orwell nursed a foolish certitude. He rightly stressed the importance of commonsense attitudes and everyday in tuitions in moral life, but he became a dogmatist when he presented these as sufficient. There are, of course, plenty of corrupt motives for clinging to the present arrangement, but even its strongest critics would realize that conceptions of what is fair or otherwise are not "blatantly obvious." The idea of fairness is contestable and this contestability has to be built into any reasonable interpretation of the principle. By drawing on the resources of narrative, Orwell was able to reveal this complexity in ways that he himself did not perhaps fully appreciate. All animals are nominally equal on Animal Farm, but what this really means or should entail is an extremely vexed issue. We soon learn that equality is an umbrella term for different and sometimes contradictory conceptions of fairness. Democracy is not a solution to this problem because it is expressive of it. Of course, the prospects for delibera tive democracy on Animal Farm are never good, given that a sizeable number of animals cannot deliberate. Orwell's portrait of democracy may be excessively cynical and may reflect the same elitist disdain for the masses that he condemned in others. Certainly, his overall view of equality seemed increasingly despairing. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, we learn that "no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer."77 Such gloom may reflect a disappointed idealism, built on an over-exacting sense of what equality is and what it should achieve. As Animal Farm suggests, equality is not the spurned solution to all our difficulties, it is a problem in its own right. But it is also the best sort of problem, because, as Orwell also acknowledged, the world would be a much poorer place without the concept.

John Roemer (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986), 283-303. Norman Geras prefers to emphasize Marx's ambivalence for the principle; see "The Controversy About Marx and Justice," in Literature of Revolution: Essays on Marxism (London: Verso, 1986), 3-57. See also G. A. Cohen, Self-Ownership Freedom and Equality (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

Hereafter cited ab breviated HC and cited parenthetically by page number. 36 Orwell sometimes equated consequentialism with "realism" (The English People, in Complete Works, 16:206). For his criticisms of the "shallow gutless hedonism" of H. G. Wells, see Wigan Pier, 188. He also criticized the hedonistic viewpoint of C. E. M. Joad and even Arthur Koestler: see his review of Journey Through the War Mind, by C. E. M. Joad; A Psychologist's Wartime Diary, by Anthony Weymouth; Ainerica Expects, by Hector Bolitho, in Complete Works, 12:178; and "Arthur Koestler," in Complete Works, 16:399, respectively. Fascism owed its popular appeal, he suggested, to its rejection of hedonism; see Wigan Pier, 199. 37 On this point, see, in particular, Bernard Williams, "Conflicts of Liberty and Equal ity," in In the Beginning was the Deed: Realism and Moralism in Political Argument (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2005), 115-27. 38 Friedrich Hayek described this issue in stark terms in The Road to Serfdom London: Routledge, 1944) and—despite some criticisms—Orwell positively reviewed the book in the Observer: see his review of The Road to Serfdom, by F. A. Hayek; The Mirror of the Past, by K. Zilliacus, in Complete Works, 16:149-50. 39 Orwell to Noel Willmett, 18 May 1944, in Complete Works, 16:191.

See also Craig Carr, Orwell, Politics and Power (London: Continuum, 2010), 16-36. 41 For an account of the distinction between descriptive and normative concepts of equality, see Bernard Williams, "The Idea of Equality," in Problems of the Self (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1973), 230-49. My own understanding of the issue in Orwell owes much to Williams. 42 See Bernard Williams, "The Idea of Equality," 230. 43 On the story's naturalization of gender differences, see Patai, 205-208. 44 See, for instance, Peter Singer, "All Animals are Equal," Philosophical Exchange 1 (1974): 243-57. 45 Orwell, "Notes on the Way," in Complete Works, 12:121-22. For a brief discussion of Orwell's racist attitudes, see Patai, 105. 46 Orwell, "Politics and the English Language," in Complete Works, 17:425. Accord ing to Orwell, words like "romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless" (425). 47 Orwell, review of An Unknown Land, by Viscount Samuel, in Complete Works, 14:254. 48 Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four, 193. 49 According to one sweeping assessment, "Orwell represents the confused and self destructive motives of a liberal humanism finally run aground on its own bankrupt ideology." Christopher Norris, "Language, Truth and Ideology: Orwell and the Postwar Left," in Inside the Myth, 245. 50 In this I shall be very much following the example of Bernard Williams in "The Idea of Equality." 51 For a discussion of this issue, see Thomas Nagel, The View from Nowhere (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1986), 156-62. 52 See Wittgenstein, 75-79. 53 Richard Rorty makes much of this fact in his essay "Orwell and Cruelty," in Con tingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

See also Allen W. Wood, Kant's Ethical Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999), esp. 89. Those committed to the ideal of a Kantian farm might still argue that killing could not be universalized on a practical basis because not everyone—those, for instance, who are killed—could adopt it as a maxim. Nor is it certain, they might add, that a state of universal war could be coherently willed. If a necessary constituent of rational willing is that one desires the satisfaction of one's ends, it would be difficult to see what ends could be secured in such a belligerent environment. 66 For a discussion of Orwell's complex attitudes toward Marx and Marxism, see Zwerdling; see also Philip Bounds, Orwell and Marxism: The Political and Cultural Thinking of George Orwell (London: I. B. Tauris, 2009). 67 He distinguishes between these types of equality in a footnote to the Second Discourse. See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Discourses and Other Early Political Writ ings, ed.
