<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUTHORS' ABSTRACTS OF RECENT BOOKS Brief informative abstracts of recent books written by the authors themselves The Thomism of Etienne Gilson: A Critical Study. By John M. Quinn. Villanova: Villanova University Press, 1971. Pp. xvi, 188. This work assesses, from within Thomism, four of the main concep tions of Etienne Gilson, who, besides being regarded as an outstanding historian of medieval philosophy, is generally recognized as a leading representative of contemporary Thomism. (i) His Christian philosophy seems to be an ambiguously named theology, (ii) Making theoretical philosophy exclusively metaphysical seems to imperil the empirical ground of a realistic metaphysics, (iii) Contrary to Gilson, existence seems con ceivable and can function as a predicate, (iv) Gilson's handling of the first three of the classic five ways to God seems flawed by a misconstrual of key terms. A concluding section pays tribute to Gilson's enormous con tribution to recent Thomism. J.M.Q. Philosophy and Political Action: Essays edited for the New York Group of the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs. Edited by Virginia Held, Kai Nielsen, and Charles Parsons. New York: Oxford University Press, 1972. Pp. x, 282. Paper. The contributions t? this book reflect the current interest in philosophi cal consideration of concrete moral and political problems. Included are an Introduction by Charles Parsons ; essays by Kai Nielsen, Joseph Margolis, and Peter Caws on the meanings and justifiability of "reform," "revolu tion," and "violence"; essays by Virginia Held, Hugo Adam Bedau, Sidney Gendin, and Gordon Schochet on defiance of the state through "strikes," draft resistance, and civil disobedience; and essays by Noam Chomsky, Robert L. Simon, Lewis Schwartz, and Stuart Hampshire on the responsibilities of philosophers and universities. The authors write in nontechnical language. In addition to providing conceptual analyses, they consider the justifiability of alternative forms of political action to deal with contemporary social problems.

Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1971. Pp. xxiv, 373, xc. Cloth, $15.00. Volume IV of The Early Works of John Dewey, 1882-1898, includes all Dewey's published writings during the years 1893-1894, as he ended his stay at the University of Michigan and moved to the University of Chicago. In addition to the sixteen articles?only one of which was re printed during the author's lifetime?the contents, arranged in chronologi cal order, include his reviews of six books and three articles, a full-length book (The Study of Ethics: A Syllabus), and verbatim reports of three oral statements. Like the three earlier volumes in this series, Volume IV received the Approved Text seal of the Center for Editions of American Authors of the Modern Language Association, signifying use of rigorous editorial pro cedures. Several sections of apparatus, with textual variations, correction of quotations, checklist of references, and publishing history, appear at the end of the book, leaving the texts themselves free of interpretive or reference material. An introduction by Wayne A. R. Leys provides insights into the rela tion between Dewey's writings of the 1893-1894 period and his later work, probing the nature and significance of the range of ideas treated by Dewey in these early works. J.A.B. (Director) An Idealistic Pragmatism: The Development of the Pragmatic Ele ment in the Philosophy of fosiah Royce. By Mary Briody Maho wald. The Hague, Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff, 1972. Pp. 186. Paper, Guilders 23.40. The author develops an *'idealistic pragmatism" by analyzing the published and unpublished texts of the idealist Josiah Royce in order to discern whether a pragmatic element is contained therein. With support from Peirce, James, and H. S. Thayer, the pragmatic element is defined as an essential emphasis on future experience. Its presence is traced in Royce's theory of knowledge, his doctrine of the Absolute, and his notion of community. Consistently idealistic, Roycean thought is shown to be increasingly pragmatic. As "community" became the culminating theme in Royce, it also became the synthesizing principle between an idealism and a pragmatism.

The work of Kant has received a variety of interpretations, such that the "essential" Kant has been shown to be, among others, a scientist, epistemologist, moralist, or theologian. In this work I have attempted to point out not only that these interpretations are not mutually exclusive, but that actually all of them fit together in extraordinary harmony when seen within the framework of what Kant himself understood to be the purpose of his system: the attempt to provide a definitive statement of the nature of man and his place in reality. Kant's early interest in anthropology has long been established. But his interest was not in a merely empirical anthropology, and when the Critical Philosophy began to take shape in the early 1770s, he dropped the proposed textbook on which he had been working, realizing that whatever he produced at that time would lack significance?precisely because it would lack the foundation in a priori principles which was ultimately to be -provided by the three Critiques. Thus the epistemologica!, moral, aesthetic and religious dimensions of man were gradually established over a period of years, culminating in the Anthropologie of 1798. The purpose of the work is to show that this is how Kant himself understood his system. F.P.V. Heidegger, Kant &amp; Time. By Charles M. Sherover. Introduction by William Barrett. Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1971. Pp. xvii, 322. Cloth, $13.95. Through an examination of the concept of time, which is fundamental to both the Critique of Pure Reason and Being and Time, this book juxta poses discussions of Kant and Heidegger in order to understand them better and to elicit the philosophic implications which point beyond them. The book spells out the special relationship between Kant and Heidegger. It argues that Kant had effectively set the stage for Heidegger's existential phenomenology which, in turn, serves to ground much of Kant's work. By placing Heidegger into a Kantian context, it claims to clarify many hitherto obscure theses. By throwing the light of Heidegger's work back onto Kant, it seeks to clarify the present significance of the Critical Philosophy. In bringing these two transcendental thinkers into dialogue the book presents some crucial issues which any adequate philosophy of time must carefully consider.

This book consists of nearly all the author's published articles, some excerpts from his books, and several hitherto unpublished papers, all organized into chapters according to topic. Each chapter has a new fore word that relates the papers to each other and to other chapters, supplies some historical notes, brings the discussion up to date, and often contains new ideas. The ten chapters are entitled: "Philosophy," "Origins," "Art," "Individuals," "Meaning," "Relevance," "Simplicity," "Induction," "Like ness," "Puzzle." N.G. Bergson and Modern Physics: A Reinterpretation and Re-evaluation. By Milic Capek. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol. VII. Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1972. Pp. XV, 414. Cloth, $22.50. In this book I tried to explore the generally neglected aspect of Bergson's philosophy: his theory of the physical world which I tried to evaluate in the light of modern physics. The book consists of three parts. In the first part I deal with Bergson's biological theory of knowl edge without which neither his theory of duration nor his theory of mat ter (which I analyze in the second and third part) can be fully under stood. Bergson's epistemology is compared with the classical form of the biological theory of knowledge (Spencer, Helmholtz, Mach, Avenarius, and Poincar?) and more recent views of Reichenbach and Piaget. In Part II the meaning of Bergsonian duration is extensively analyzed, the usual clich? of Bergson's anti-intellectualism rejected and the objections of some serious critics (R. Berthelot, A. O. Lovejoy, A. Ushenko, R. Ingarden and J. Royce) discussed. In the third part Bergson's views of matter as con sisting of imageless events and possessing elementary ind?termination are compared with the results of quantum physics and with the views of Boutro?x, Peirce, Whitehead, de Broglie, and B?hm; the structure of Bergson's 'extension' is compared with that of the relativistic time-space and his criticism of the relativity theory reevaluated. Three appendices deal with Russell's complex relations with Bergson, with the relation of the microphysicai indeterminacy to freedom and, finally, with Bergson's views on entropy and cosmogony.

Contrary to the large part of critical opinion, this study attempts to show that Nietzsche's philosophy represents a unified world view in which seemingly disconnected and contradictory concepts share one common un derlying principle^?that of the tragic or Dionysian. This unifying prin ciple serves as the guideline through the intricacies of Nietzsche's thought, particularly those of the doctrine of Eternal Recurrence. It orders the complexity of his ideas into a coherent and interconnected pattern. It provides the fundamental basis of his metaphysical, ethical, and religious views which culminate in a conception of the universe that abolishes the traditional philosophical distinctions and is essentially aesthetic. Nietzsche is here assigned a place in the grand tradition of Western thought. Not only are the links to Heraclitus, Schopenhauer, Kant, and Hegel discussed, but also the less familiar ones to Spinoza and Goethe. Above all, the author wants to stress the connection of Nietzsche's "tragic world view" with contemporary thought, because it represents a view of life that is based upon the experience of absurdity, despair, and the reality of evil?upon a "strong pessimism" that affirms this world with all its contradictions. R.P. On Heidegger and Language. Edited and translated by Joseph J. Kockelmans. Evanston, 111.: Northwestern University Press, 1972. Pp. xix, 380. Cloth, $11.50. This anthology is the first publication in English to focus exclusively on the implications of Heidegger's conception of language. The first sec tion consists of two introductory essays describing Heidegger's contribu tion to the philosophy of language in general. The six papers in the second section, presented at the International Colloquium on Heidegger's Con ception of Language (1969), explore Heidegger's view on the relationship between thought, poetry, and language and indicate the place of the author's conception of language within his philosophy as a whole. The third section contains two linguistically oriented essays which explain how Heidegger's distinctive vocabulary is related to his philosophy of language. The contributors are: Jan Aler, Walter Biemel, Henri Birault, Joseph Kockelmans, Johannes Lohmann, Werner Marx, Heinrich Ott, Otto P?g geler, and Erasmus Sch?fer. All translations were made by the editor. JJ.K,</page><page sequence="6">authors' abstracts 705 Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's Philosophy of Evolution. By H. James Birx. Springfield, 111.: Charles C Thomas, 1972. Pp. xxii, 163. Cloth, $9.75. The works of Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S.J. (1881-1955) represent a bold, unique, but unsuccessful attempt to synthesize the special sciences, process philosophy, theology, and mysticism into a coherent and comprehensive view of man's true place, meaning, and purpose in the universe. This book critically and historically examines Teilhard's basic philosophical assumptions (spiritual monism, Law of increasing centro Complexity-Consciousness, critical thresholds, and Omega Point), referring to the relevant philosophical and/or scientific literature from Lamarck to Whitehead. In short, Teilhard's Catholic philosophy of planetary evolution is ultimately an attempt to give natural arguments for a personal God, immortality of the human soul, freedom of the human will, and a divine destiny for the human species. Yet his works do not represent a rigorous historico-phenomenological analysis and synthesis of cosmic evolution, but support an anthropocentric and anthropomorphic vision of planetary evolu tion grounded in spiritualism, vitalism, eschatology, theology, and mys ticism. The author argues for a sound philosophical anthropology grounded in naturalism, humanism, and a cosmic perspective. H.J.B. Linguistics. By David Crystal. Middlesex, Eng.: Penguin Books, 1971, A Pelican Original. Pp. 267. Paper, $1.65. This book attempts to provide a general introduction to the subject of linguistics for the general reader or first-year student. It presupposes no previous reading, and restricts itself to general principles. It opens with a discussion of the need for systematic language study, and of the in adequacy of traditional models of analysis to fill this need. The char acteristics of a scientific approach to language are gone into at some length, particular attention being paid to contemporary views of the nature of linguistic inquiry. There is a short illustration of linguistic methods of investigation in grammar. There then follows a long chapter in which the history of ideas which has led to the present state of the subject is outlined and related to the main 'schools' and personalities in volved in the subject's present-day study. The book concludes with a short chapter in which interdisciplinary developments with linguistics are re viewed.

Paper, Dan. kr. 30.00 (approx. $4.60). In 1962 Dr. Peter ZinkernagelV book Conditions for Description was published in the series The International Library of Philosophy and Scientific Method, edited by A. J. Ayer. As the theory of informal logic presented in that work was elaborated, it turned out to have a strong impact on such major problems in epistemology as, for example, the dichotomy between analytic and synthetic propositions, the theories of meaning as put forward by the logical empiricists and the early and later Wittgenstein, and the Berkeleyan problem of the external world. Un fortunately, however, the theory dealt rather summarily with questions such as the relationship between the basic rules of formal logic and other conditions for description and the general possibility of demarcating descriptive language. Hence the theory was not judged by its merits, but rather by its deficiencies. The present companion work attempts to provide the reader of philoso phy with a systematic treatment of the theory of conditions for descrip tion and to eliminate the major difficulties originally connected with that theory. K.H.J. Josiah Royce: An Intellectual Biography. By Bruce Kuklick. Indian apolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1972. Pp. ix, 270. Cloth, $12.50. This book attempts to sort out the issues which led Royce to the views he defended and shows how his position changed over the years as he refined it and faced new difficulties. He began his career as a neo Kantian puzzled by the same problems which perplexed William James, and the idealistic arguments of The Religious Aspect of Philosophy were advanced only after several years as a "pure pragmatist." During the 1890s Royce explored various resolutions of the connection between the world of the Absolute and the world of everyday experience, concentrating on psychological ones. By the end of the century?in The World and the Individual and what followed it?he turned to symbolic logic to effect the reconciliation, and mathematical studies dominated his thinking until 1910. Royces last writings, notably The Problem of Christianity, try to translate his technical conclusions into more comprehensible language. In tracing this development, I have identified three themes in Royce s work?the impact of logic on his philosophy, the relationship between pragmatism and idealism, and the significance of Kant.

The first part of this book is a historical review of the idea of social progress from classical antiquity to the present. Against or rather along side of the alternative appraisals, optimistic and pessimistic, the view pro posed here is that the history of civilization is marked by an increasing range of human capacities for good or for evil. The course of history reveals how much higher men could rise or how much lower men might sink?depending upon their choices between contending values. The world-wide crisis of our day has emphasized the gravity of the basic issue. Modern industry has expanded vastly the scope of satisfied human needs, but it has also spread destructive pollution of our whole environment, earth, water, and air. Modern atomic science has unlocked natural re sources and energies, the peaceful use of which would enable us to achieve a masterpiece of civilization. But these energies are also destruc tive, and we find ourselves on the brink of exploding our whole human world to deadly ashes. The second part of this book is devoted to the testing of the validity of this view by an exploration of the principal fields of social experience in their historical setting: including the evolu tion of the family and the emancipation of women, economic values and technology, social order and personal freedom, intellectual and aesthetic values, and moral and religious development. R.A.T. An Analysis of Metaphor in the Light of W. M. Urban9s Theories. By Warren A. Shibles. The Hague: Mouton, 1971. Pp. 171. Paper. Metaphor is seen to play a major role in philosophy as well as in other disciplines yet there is no generally acceptable theory of metaphor. This book is an attempt to establish a sound theory of metaphor. Wilbur Urban's theory of language and metaphor is critically presented and con trasted with other theories such as the substitution and literal theories of language and metaphor, as well as with Wittgenstein's theory of language. In the final chapter an alternative view is developed suggesting how analogy and metaphor may be effectively used in philosophical reasoning. The appendix contains a detailed analysis of the views of Aristotle, Max M?ller, I. A. Richards, Northrop Frye, and Max Black. The book contains a detailed analytical index of concepts of metaphor which corresponds to the index of the author's Metaphor: An Annotated Bibliography and History.

Ruther ford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1972. Pp. 288. Cloth, $11.50. For years Indian philosophy has been synonymous with varying de grees of world-negation. The world is "Maya," "illusion," somehow un real, and any human effort to improve it is vain and absurd. The goal of life is escape from the deception into union with the transcendent Divine. It is against this background that the present work examines Aurobindo's conviction that the world is indeed real and thoroughly worthy of humanity's most dedicated action. After a brief exposition of Aurobindo's spiritual history, the chief theses of his system are analyzed as a sequence of conclusions drawn from the most fruitful of his yogic experiences. The discussion then focuses on Sri Aurobindo's battle against Illusionism, marshalling his arguments from logic, Scripture, spiritual ex perience, and practical and political life. The final chapters are devoted to Aurobindo's own view of the value of the world, emphasizing its in trinsically divine nature and its evolution to ever higher levels of con sciousness in individual experience and in community action. The book concludes with a sympathetic critique of Aurobindo's thought and some remarks about its practical usefulness for the West as well as the East. B.B. A Theory of Reasons for Action. By David A. J. Richards. London: Oxford University Press, 1971. Pp. xiv, 370. Cloth, $14.50. Dialectically directed against recent subjectivist developments in moral theory (emotivism and prescriptivism), this book argues for a general normative theory which is empiricist, objective, propositional, and natural istic. A systematic analytic method is used to clarify concepts central to normative experience such as: rules, principles, rationality, reasonableness, moral right, obligation, and the good. A central feature of the analytic method is to show how a propositional account of sentence meaning is compatible with an account of the practical uses of such language and its tendency to influence conduct. An attempt is made to relate metaethical inquiries and moral casuistry. Among topics thus discussed are "just" wars and revolutions, natural law theory, the moral obligation to obey the law, conscientious objection, the morality of suicide and killing, pater nalism, the morality of sexual deviance and masochism, population and eugenic control, the morality of love, and the reasons for being moral.

Pp. x, 149. Paper, $5.00. While a variety of positions are taken in the essays in this volume they are united in their concern with the meaningfulness of religious language and/or the problem of religious knowledge. Five of them deal specifically with the question of the assertion status of religious utterances. Professor Blackstone views the problem in light of the falsifiability criterion of meaning. Dr. Broiles indicates some of the difficulties found in the non cognitivist's response to the falsifiability criterion. Professors Clarke and Harrison argue that the claim "there is a God" is assertive because a logically necessary statement asserting a necessary state of affairs. Professor Nielsen, on the other hand, argues that such a claim is a delusion. Two of the essays deal with the problem of epistemology with Professor Hart shorne considering some of the classical arguments for the existence of God and Professor Altizer discussing the dialectical methodology of Buddhism. The essay by Professor Ayers deals with the structure of a non rational type of religious language?namely, myth and mythical utterances. Thus, the purpose of this volume is to analyze as clearly as possible some of the basic issues in contemporary philosophy of religion. R.H.A. and W.T.B. Contemporary European Ethics: Selected Readings. Edited by Joseph J. Kockelmans. Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co. (Anchor Books), 1972. Pp. x, 503. Paper, $2.95. This anthology of readings is meant to inform the English-speaking reader of developments in ethics which have taken place in continental Europe over the past thirty years. Representing an attempt to fill a gap that has been felt by many for quite some time, the book tries to show that the problem of ethics as such, and many individual ethical questions in particular, constitute a substantial part of, if not the main concern of, many leading European philosophers in France and in the German speaking countries. The book contains selections by the following authors : Lavelle, Jank?l?vitch, Marcel, Ricoeur, Le Senne, Reiner, Polin, Gusdorf, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Jeanson, Camus, Heidegger, Bollnow, Steinb?chel, Buber, Bonhoeffer, and Thielicke. The selections, many of which are translated here for the first time, are divided into four sections: spiritualist ethics, axiological ethics, three contemporary conceptions of humanism, and situation ethics.

Pp. c, 292. Cloth, $15.00. Published in the original Italian in 1931, Gentile's book appears now for the first time in English translation. The work presents a systematic treatment of esthetics from a strictly philosophical point of view. The three main sections into which it is divided ("Introduction: The Problem of Art," "First Part: The Concreteness of Art," "Second Part: The At tributes of Art") deal respectively with the universal human character of art and its relationship to philosophy; the nature, place, and function of art in the life of the spirit ; and a number of specific matters, such as language, technique, the distinction between the arts, taste and genius, criticism, art and morality, etc. Harshly critical of Croce's well-known esthetic theory, The Philosophy of Art throws much light on it, pointing out its basic weaknesses. Since Gentile's esthetics is generally not known in the English speaking world, a ninety-page introduction by the translator offers a critical overview of the author's thought, theory of art, and literary criticism, showing, through frequent references to Croce, Gentile's origi nality and contribution to twentieth-century esthetics. G.G. What Is Knowledge? By David Pears. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971. Pp. vii, 106. Cloth, $6.50. This monograph is intended as an introduction to the theory of knowledge, and, since philosophy is often approached by this route, as an introduction to philosophy. Three types of knowledge are distinguished from one another and described?factual knowledge, knowledge how to do things and knowledge by acquaintance. Claims to knowledge often have to be based on adequate reasons, and so two kinds of reasons are dis cussed, a priori reasons and inductive reasons, and their standards of adequacy are examined. Claims to knowledge differ in their subject matter, and three types, differentiated in this way, are examined, per ceptual knowledge, knowledge of universals and memory of past experi enced facts. None of these aspects of knowledge is discussed completely or in depth. The aim has been only to initiate the investigation, and to exhibit connections between its various parts. One topic, however, has been treated at some length?the three-cornered debate between scientific realists, sceptics and phenomenalists, which has dominated so much of the theory of knowledge since the Renaissance.

Although the meaning of existentialism for educational theory and practice has become more evident in recent years, nowhere in the English literature relating existentialism to education is there any mention of the contributions of Italian existential thought. Education as Existential Possibility fills this gap by introducing the philosophy of Nicola Abbagnano, the chief exponent of Italian existential ism. The dominant themes within Abbagnano's philosophy, such as pos sibility, freedom, choice, death and coexistence, are contrasted with the positions of Heidegger and Sartre. It is in the linking of such themes to educational theory and practice, that is, in practical application, that Nicola Abbagnano is seen as pro viding a new direction to existentialism?leading it away from a nihilistic and negative position to one of hope and faith. G.L-C. Logical Analysis and Contemporary Theism. Edited by John Don nelly. New York: Fordham University Press, 1972. Pp. xi, 337. Cloth, $12.50. This volume of twenty essays seeks to reconstruct a viable, philosophical theology. The opening essays, by James Ross, William Rowe, R. G. Swin burne, and H. J. Horsburgh, argue for a modal proof of God's existence, a defense of the cosmological and of the teleologica! proofs, and the argu ment from religious experience. William Alston, Daniel Bennett, and John Hick focus attention on the concept of God, particularly the Divine Simplicity and the concept of necessary being. Ross deals with the formal requirements of theological predication, the applications of which lead Nelson Pike, Alvin Plantinga, Rowe, Anthony Kenny, George Mavrodes, C. Wade Savage, and John Donnelly, respectively, to consider puzzles sur rounding the concept of the benevolent, omniscient, omnipotent creator of the universe. R. F. Holland and Paul Dietl explore the legitimacy of "miracle-talk," while Jerry Gill investigates the epistemological issue of religious verification. In the concluding essays, Roderick Chisholm removes certain conceptual difficulties from the theistic belief in immortality, while Donnelly attempts to remove the paradox of Kierkegaard's famed "teleo logica! suspension of the ethical." j.d.</page><page sequence="13">712 THE MONIST Problems of Mind: Descartes to Wittgenstein.

Problems of Mind deals with such topics as Cartesian dualism, solip sism, inner ostensive definition, inferring the existence of other minds, introspection as a source of mental concepts, tangible and intangible mental phenomena, mind-brain identity, logical behaviorism. The three major theories (mind-body dualism, mind-brain monism, behaviorism) are argued against. A main aim of the book is to indicate the bearing of Wittgenstein's thought on the classical problems of the nature of mental phenomena, as these problems take shape in the conceptions of Descartes, Locke, Hume, Mill, Smart, Carnap, and Skinner. N.M. Theories of Punishment. Edited by Stanley E. Grupp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1971. Pp. vi, 401. Cloth, $12.50. These readings examine the various schools of thought in punishment theory?the retributive, deterrent, rehabilitative and integrative perspec tives. Statements included represent classical treatments of the subject by distinguished authorities. Authors represented include D. J. B. Hawkins, K. G. Armstrong, J. D. Mabhott, Johs Andenaes, C. S. Lewis, Francis A. Allen, F. J. O. Coddington, H. L. A. Hart and Jerome Hall. The colla tion presents a critical analysis of each of the theories. Instructors of courses concerned with punishment theory will therefore find the book of special value.

This book takes the view that language is a fusion of two identifiable but interdependent processes. The first, Rhetoric, is the purposive, inter personal, communicative, self-assertive dimension; the second, Ritual, is the poetic, intrapersonal, constitutive, self-transcending dimension. The latter is logically, chronologically, and symbologically prior to the former, and is the symbolic ground from which the former develops both onto and phylogenetically.

New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972. Pp. viii, 317. Paper, $3.95. Although Charles Peirce published no book in philosophy, he did publish several series of articles which may be seen as forming the central core of his philosophic concern. By studying Peirce through these articles it is possible to maintain a strong sense of the chronology of his philosophi cal development as well as to have an opportunity to study his views as presented in material which he himself saw as completed for publication. The collection includes material from an 1871 article in the North Ameri can Review on the Works of George Berkeley in which Peirce first argues the realism-nominalism issue, the 1868 series in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy on Certain Faculties Claimed for Man in which Peirce s epistemology is established, two of the 1877-78 Popular Science Monthly series on the Logic of Science in which he first announced his pragmatism, the Monist series of 1891-92 which represents the best statement of Peirce s metaphysics, part of the Monist series of 1905 stating his later pragmatism, and concludes with some of Peirce s contributions to Bald win's Dictionary in 1902.
