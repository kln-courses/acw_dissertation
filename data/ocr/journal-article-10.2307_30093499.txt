WE are far from being adequately provided in the English language with a really scientific apologetical literature from the Catholic standpoint. And until we produce our own, we must rely to a large extent on translations. The McVey Press, Philadelphia, gave us, in 1910, an English version of Lspin's J6U8 Messic et Fils de Dieu. This was hitherto the best and most scholarly treatment of the subject from a Catholic pen that we possessed; and it remains indispensable for students and professors alike. But the two large volumes now under review are much fuller and more compre hensive. They have the German quality of thoroughness, without, be it added, the German defect of vagueness. They accomplish for us a task of great importance and no small difficulty, in as much as they supply a clue to the bewildering maze of "critical" theories upon the person and claims of Our Lord. Much more fully than was attempted by Lxpin does Dr. Felder initiate us into the views of his feIlow-countrymen who for more than a century have been laying siege to the central citadel of the Christian faith. He cites at considerable length these writers themselves-many of them scarcely accessible to students outside the Fatherland. His know ledge of the literature gives proof of an admirable industry. If he did no more than this, he would still have rendered the treatise De Vera Religione much easier to study and to teach. For the hypotheses of the "Higher Criticism," as it loves to call itself, have this about them that they destroy one another. Our author puts it perfectly when he writes: "One critic attacks another, until the last falls upon his own sword" (v. II, p. 16). There reigns in the critical camp a thoroughly Babylonic confusion. It was so from the start, and is so to-day. Thus while one school, the Liberal-Protestant, seeks to minimise as much as possible the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 135 claims of Christ to Messiahship and Divine Sonship, or to explain them so as to fit in with its merely human Christ, who is yet the noblest, wisest, and holiest of men ; another, the Psycho pathical and Psychiatric, insists strongly on these claims, because in them precisely it finds the proof that He must have been mentally unbalanced, an exalte', a fanatic suffering from megalo mania. Again, while Harnack and his followers, who consider the claim to Sonship, understood ethically, the fundamental point in Christ's teaching about Himself, reject or whittle down the Messianic texts, so that Messiahship is nothing more than the duty of proclaiming the universal Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of men; Loisy, from his standpoint, makes Messiahship, eschato logically interpreted, the primary and most important claim of Christ, and repudiates or distorts the passages referring to divine filiation. There is, indeed, hardly a single tenet of one school that is not cancelled by those of another. But Dr. Felder, with astonishing patience, takes up one by one the various theories that have been framed to explain Christ while denying His divinity, and shows how impossible they are in them selves, and how utterly irreconcilable with one another. He begins with an examination of the chief sources-the Gospels. Here, fortunately, the critics themselves have made it easy for him to be brief. The triumph of tradition relative to the authen ticity and historicity of the Christian sources has been almost complete. The differences separating any truly scientific criticism, however "liberal," from traditional views on this great question are now so slight as to be, from the apologist's standpoint, nearly negligible. But, granting even the substantial accuracy of the Gospel narrative, the Messianic claims of Christ must be admitted as pertaining to the original tradition. And that raises at once the problem of His Messianic Consciousness-the most puzzling problem of to-day for liberal critics. Orthodoxy has no difficulty in the matter at all. He claimed to be the Messias and the Son of God because He was both. The claim would be inadmissible, and even blasphemous, if He were a mere man; but it would be also incon ceivable, and certainly unprecedented, if He were a mere man. And above all it would not have been confirmed by miracle, Prophecy, perfect holiness of life, supreme excellence of doctrine, or finally, by the most paradoxical of triumphs-through what appeared, at first sight, the most complete and utter failure. God could not have thus set the sign-manual of His approval upon so gross an imposture, if imposture it were.</page><page sequence="3">136 Studies [MARCH But the dilemma for rationalistic critics, whether they retain some shreds of the old German pietism or not, is very painful. They start with the fixed idea, as a basic principle, that the super natural is impossible. With this presupposition, always assumed and nowhere proven, they set out to interpret documents instinct with the supernatural and the miraculous. To ac300t them at all, even while retaining the liberty of eliminating the clearest passages -a privilege liberal criticism never foregoes-is to be brought up against the old dilemma: Christ is either the Messiah and Son of God, or an impostor, or a madman. From this there is no escape; and the various shifts made to evade the horns of it are pitiful in the extreme. Dr. Felder has little difficulty in exposing their weakness. While the work will primarily appeal to students and professors of Fundamental Theology, it should also prove useful to anyone whose faith has suffered from vague and utterly unfounded fears of the "Higher Criticism." Preachers, too, who wish to lend solidity and interest to their ser600s or conferences on the person and character of Our Divine Lord, will consult it with profit. A double index of authors and subjects completes each volume. The Logia in Ancient and Recent Literature. Whether Papias, bishop of Hierapolis circa 120-130 A.D., deserved the injurious words of Eusebius that "he was a man of very small mind," is matter for controversy. But it is outside the sphere of controversy that he has caused no small stir in the modern world of learning. He would have needed a very remarkable gift of prophecy to foresee the use that would one day be made of his simple sentence: "Mat thew composed the oracles of the Lord in Aramaic, and each one interpreted them as best he could." Liberal Biblical criticism has found in these words the starting point for its hunt after the "original" document or documents behind our Gospels; and it is hardly credible how much nonsense has been penned in con sequence. One of the pivotal points in the controversy has always been the precise meaning of the words Ao'ta Kvtwa', the Login of the Lord. The critics translated them as "sayings or discourses of the Lord," and drew the conclusion that the work referred to by Papias could not be identical in substance with our first Gospel, which contains much more than sayings. They thus got rid of Papias' testi600y to our St. Matthew, the earliest, explicit, extrinsic proof that we possess. They were then entitled, as they thought, to dissect our text at will, rejecting what did not square with their theories as "not original," not found in that</page><page sequence="4">1925 Reviews 137 wholly imaginary "Q," which could be made to take any shape and extent desirable. Needless to say Christian tradition from the earliest days under stood Papias as referring to our St. Matthew, and asserting that it was first written in Aramaic before being authoritatively repro duced in Greek. By "Logia" was meant "the oracles of the Lord." The phrase in the context is seen to be equivalent to "sayings and doings of the Lord." For we are told that Mark wrote of these as Peter preached them, and of the latter that he proclaimed them as occasion demanded, not making an ordered narrative of "the oracles of the Lord." Hence Logia could stand for more than Ser600 on the Mount and similar utterances of the Master. The name suited the First Gospel admirably on account of the many discourses it contains. Pr. Donovan, in this little brochure, sets out to show.that the word Logia means oracles and is practically the equivalent of our "Inspired Word," or "Word of God," "Holy Writ," "Divine Revelation." This he does very convincingly by reviewing its usage in Classical Greek, in the Old and New Testaments, in Josephus and Philo, and finally in the early Fathers. He then concludes that in Papias the phrase Adyta Kviaxd means "the Scriptures pertaining to the Lord," "Holy Writ about the Lord." He is taken to task for this by a correspondent in The Tablet, Nov. 22, 1924, p. 697, who maintains that this is a forced inter pretation, not necessary for the defence of tradition on the point. The objection would appear to be valid. Adta itself means "sacred sayings," "oracles," "inspired words." With Kvtacd added it should signify "sacred sayings or oracles of the Lord." Any other interpretation seems strained, and is not called for. Let us put for" Oracles of the Lord "the equivalent phrase "teach ing or doctrine of the Lord." Surely this could stand as an alter native title for our St. Matthew. It is hypercriticism to say that such a title cuts out all the narrative. Men use looser synonyms every day, even the critics themselves, no doubt, when they are not citing the evangelists for criminal cross-examination. Hence it is possible to concede the first part of Fr. Donovan's contention without admitting the second. But though venturing to do so, I make haste to add that the little work does not lose its value on this account; it is a very scholarly contribution to an old but still living problem. Pagan and Chrietian Rule. Milton tells us that in the beginning of time the Spirit of God sat brooding over the abyss of Chaos and</page><page sequence="5">138 Studies [MARM evolved the ordered cosmos we behold. There is a touch of anthropomorphism about this ; but we understand what is meant. And there are many who believe, or hope at least, that over the chaotic world of to-day the Spirit of God again sits brooding, intent on evolving some more tolerable and stable state of affairs than that which has been shattered by the shells. Dom Bkvenot is one of these. But he is not a mere dreamer of dreams. On the contrary he keeps his feet firmly planted on the solid ground of history, and does not even lose himself in any misty optimism about the future. He is not sure that our European civilisation, which includes whatever civilisation exists in the Americas, Africa and Australasia, will find salvation. He knows that the Roman Empire perished because it did not know the hour of its visitation, and sees clearly enough that our neo-paganism may likewise perish. But he has hopes that it may not. The Church can save it still, if it is allowed to do so. The question turns on the action of men's free-will, and that no knowledge less than divine can forecast with certainty. But the present situation is obvious enough. Mr. Hilaire Belloc says in the Preface: "It is sufficiently clear to those who survey Europe in the mass and follow the full outline of their time, that our civilisation must return to the Faith or be destroyed." To this theme Mr. Belloc has already devoted an able volume, Europe and the Faith, in which he proceeds by way of a vast vue d'ensemble, such as he loves and handles with great skill. Dom Brvenot prefers to drive home the same contention by a series of historical vignettes. He takes three critical periods of the past -the Age of Augustus, the Age of Theodosius, and the Thirteenth Century-examines them under the lens, and seeks to elicit the lessons they convey. He shows us the Church's task at each of these turning-points, how she faced it, and what measure of success or failure attended her efforts. He rightly insists upon the spiritual forces at work, as being the most important and decisive. Not on bread alone do individuals or communities live. The thoughts they think, the ideals they hold, the ethics they embrace in theory and practice-these things make destiny much more decisively than the clash of political or economic interests. For a long time now there has been something wrong in thoughts, ideals, and ethics alike. This is too painfully manifest in the results to permit of doubt. And the question is, What of the future Our author, like Mr. Belloc, sees a conditional hope for our civilisation. Only on a Christian and Catholic basis can the world be rebuilt. This is a bold thesis, and would have excited derision twenty years ago. It will be disputed still, but with con</page><page sequence="6">1925 Reviezris 139 siderably less derision. It needs to be proclaimed. " In history we must abandon the defensive," adds Mr. Belloc. And it is time that Catholics everywhere realised the strength of their position, not only in history but in every sphere of human activity. Far too long they have permitted their enemies in the intellectual warfare to dictate the strategy of the campaign, and have allowed their morale to be lowered by hostile propaganda. The Church has a mission to the world of to-day as it had in the days of Tiberius, and it should proclaim that mission as confidently as did the Apostles. Porn Bbvenot does so boldly, but soberly and judiciously. He is not afraid to admit defects, limitations and failures, partial or complete, on the part of the human elements in the Church. But he has no difficulty in de600strating that Catholicism did in point of fact save Europe again and again ; nor any greater difficulty in showing that it and it alone can repeat the historical miracle of calling a Lazarus-like civilisation from the tomb where it is already beginning to corrupt-iam foetet. Deux Arguments pour le Catholicisme. M. Eymieu has rendered the reviewer's task very light by giving in the Foreword a perfect rzsumg of his own work. I need simply translate it : What then are the two arguments here they are in skeleton : 1. It is impossible for the Catholic religion not to present innumerable and manifest contradictions in its body of doctrines if it is not divine. But it does not, in point of fact, present such contradictions. Therefore it is divine. 2. It is impossible for the Catholic religion not to present in the course of its history innumerable and manifest doctrinal variations, if it is not divine. But it does not present these variations. Therefore it is divine. The first argument interprets the coherence of the doctrine; the second its stability. These two arguments have often been adduced as negative notes of divine origin. But our author contends that, taken together and viewed in their fulness, they can be said to be in them selves a positive proof-not the only one, of course, but for practical purposes sufficient. There is a slight element of pragmatism in the contention. But not all pragmatism is unsound; and the author's position seems entirely justified. Further it is the kind of proof which appeals to many men, especially to those who have not the time or knowledge necessary for appraising the greater, and in themselves more cogent, arguments on which the Catholic Position rests. Each of the two arguments is developed at considerable length and enforced by a comparison with the doctrinal confusion and Perpetual variation found in Protestantism from the start. Even the Eastern churches illustrate the arguments by various</page><page sequence="7">140 Studies [MARCH</page></plain_text>
