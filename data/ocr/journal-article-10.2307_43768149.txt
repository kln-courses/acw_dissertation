For the inhabitant of a country has at least nine characters: a professional, a national, a civic, a class, a geographic, a sexual, a conscious, an unconscious, and possibly even a private character to boot. He unites them in himself, but they dissolve him, so that he is really nothing more than a small basin hollowed out by these many streamlets that trickle into it and drain out of it again, to join other such rills in filling some other basin. Which is why every inhabitant of the earth also has a tenth character that is nothing else than the passive fantasy of spaces yet unfilled. This permits a person all but one thing: to take seriously what his at least nine other characters do and what happens to them; in other words, it prevents precisely what should be his true fulfilment. This interior space - admittedly hard to describe - is of a different shade and shape in Italy from what it is in England, because everything that stands out in relief against it is of a different shade or shape; and yet it is in both places the same: an empty, invisible space, with reality standing inside it like a child's toy town deserted by the imagination. R. Musil, The man without qualities (p. 30). In this passage, Musil's claims on the limitations of 'character' point to a crucial articulation for any reading of a 'view of man/self, epitomizing the spectrum of possible approaches involved in reading 'character' (albeit meant by the writer in a wider ethical sense, and not necessarily as literary character). For one can privilege any one of the 'nine characters' over the others or over the whole - as, say, Marxism privileges class, or psychoanalysis privileges the unconscious. Alternatively, one can concentrate on the empty 'basin' itself, as ultimate repository of identity - as Cartesians and, perhaps, Structuralists do. Or again, one can dwell on that 'interior space' (' admittedly hard to describe '), which contains the world merely as a disposable delusion - as nineteenth-century novelists do: this is arguably the viewpoint that Musil himself regards as the truest. Musil's sketch is a suitable starting-point for the present inquiry into the representation of fictional character, since what I shall be attempting is a reading of characterization in Greek literature, and especially tragedy, as function of a wider 'view of self. The approach I shall take corresponds to none of the ones cited above, but rather tries to read character (to keep Musil's image) from the whole process by which the 'streams' fill the basin, in the belief that the world and reality, far from being that 'child's toy town deserted by the imagination', are often indistinguishably bound up with the view of self and therefore with the projection of character; moreover, in the belief that both streams and basin cannot exist without one another. 1</page><page sequence="12">2 HIDDEN PATHS I therefore begin by arguing a connection between characterization and view of mind or self (Chapter I). I explore developments in the understanding of the perceptions of self in Greek literature (1.1), offering a formula for the 'Greek view of man' in terms of 'balance between man and world', and arguing for a development of psychological depth in parallel to a problematization of the view of reality as a system (1.2). I go on to consider various strands of criticism of character (1.3) and tragic character in particular (1.4), then to analyse various Greek texts to illustrate my claims further, reading the 'meagreness' of tragic characterization against the lyric poets' more idiosyncratic presentation of innerness (1.5) and Homeric presentations of self (1.6, 1.7, 1.8). I then focus on features and conventions of the tragic genre and their bearing on the presentation of character (1.9). After these theoretical discussions, I concentrate on Euripides' Bacchae (Chapters II, III and IV). Euripides' last play offers us a distinctive presentation of man and mental life: we may anticipate attention to idiosyncrasy, the pivotal role attributed to unawareness of oneself as permanent feature of one's character, and a concomitant mistrust in the possibility of understanding the world in which we live. I shall confront characterization in the play with a strategic, if artificial, distinction between aspects of the 'private self as separated from the external world ('the basin', in Chapter II) and the relationship between individual and external world determined in the play ('the streams', in Chapter III), but with a constant attention to the continuity between the two elements. Finally, in Chapter IV, I shall consider stylistic and narratological aspects of Greek drama as functional to the view of man, and the originality of Bacchae in this respect.</page><page sequence="13">CHAPTER I - CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN In seeking to define and analyse the representation of character in Greek tragedy, it is essential to take into account the relationship between this issue and the broader, more general view of self and the concept of man in the ancient Greek world. Only through a careful and thorough confrontation between the concept of self in Greek culture and the representation of character in drama, is it possible to isolate and define the proper qualities of the latter as element of a dramatic pattern, as actant in a fictional plot and as mythological, culturally grounded figure. In short, reference to these broader conceptions is indispensable to illuminate tragic character as such, insofar as any tragic character differs from a real human being and plays a role in the agreed artifice of drama. As a consequence, all the following points of discussion about the construction and view of character are issues separable from the particular nature of tragedy, and require consideration in the light of the earlier literary tradition and the history of mentality. These considerations are also valid, not just for drama, but for the criticism of character in the wider field of literature; and, as J. Frow points out, they are not 'specific to the discourse of literary theory, but . . . necessarily dependent upon cultural schemata defining the nature of the self.1 In this chapter I shall begin by analysing the problem of literary character from a theoretical point of view; I will consider a number of key-features of the so-called 'Greek view of man' and conception of self as it has impinged on modern theorizing, emphasizing the more problematic points of disagreement between such a view and the views held by moderns, along with various associated misunderstandings. This will necessarily involve some consideration of the modern philosophy of mind. I will then analyse some literary examples through which the interrelation between the 'view of man' and the fictional representation of characters is highlighted. These will be organized along the lines of three important features of the Greek - but not only Greek - worldview: the decision-making process, the relationship with the divine world, and the social structure. Examples from Homer to tragedy will be offered in an attempt to define a development in the literary representation of man. 1 . 1 The Greek perception of self: from Snell to Gill As one might expect, there is a correlation between advancement in the philosophy of mind, and changing tendencies in the criticism of character. The positions held by philosophers about mind and consciousness - 'the self - in the twentieth century help us to understand the problems that the special representation of characters in Greek drama raises - namely its objectivity, normativity and what we shall call its meagreness (in the sense of disregard for the daily and the idiosyncratic). ' Frow (1986) 227. 3</page><page sequence="14">4 HIDDEN PATHS A starting point is Snell's classic, The Discovery of the Mind. This book, first published in 1946, constituted for a long time the vulgata as far as the study of Homeric (and archaic Greek) representations of mental and bodily facts was concerned. The main thesis of this work, as is well known, centres on the lack of a unitary view of self in Homer, the primitivity of this view, the lack of genuine decision-making in the Homeric poems, and the corresponding analytic, non-organic representation of the body in them. The 'birth' of the idea of individual and self is ascribed to Ionic-Aeolic poetry, only to be fully developed in tragedy. Snell's position is based on Cartesian and Kantian prejudices,2 and on an evolutionist view of human culture which now seems unsatisfactory: the concepts of a unitary and centripetal self, and the idea of consciousness and ethical autonomy, are seen by the author as key features of humanity. Sharp oppositions between mind and body, internal and external, subject and object, are taken for granted as measures for the 'primitivity' of a culture: any departure from these distinctions is regarded as underdevelopment. Besides Snell, some other historians of ideas have made use of a 'lexical method' in dealing with these issues. This method acknowledges the existence of a concept in a culture only from the first occurrence of a word expressing that concept. Snell's theory is grounded on the evidence that Homeric terminology for mind and body lacks a unifying term.3 One example out of many of the influence of this approach in more recent historical psychology is Barbu's 'The emergence of personality in the Greek world'.4 Focusing on 'the transition in Greek society and culture from the pre-individualistic to the individualistic stage',5 Barbu goes so far as to claim that 'at this stage of ancient history, man knew himself only as "participant" in the life of his community. The personality of the individual ... was submerged into the structure of a group'.6 Barbu also claims that 'there are grounds to believe that the Greeks of the Homeric era were not aware of themselves as having a mind of their own'.1 In the past forty years this view has had a number of opponents, in line with philosophical opposition to the Cartesian-Kantian frame which has informed the western ideal of man. In this revisionist generation, such concepts as 'consciousness', 'intention', 'will', and the existence of a level of objective, common reality are no longer seen as straightforward; they are problematized and their very existence is under debate. It is impossible to give here a detailed discussion of these developments in modern thought, but some pointers may be useful. In the last century - in particular, in the past 2 See Gill (1996) 29ff. 3 A useful assessment of this fallacy is offered by Williams (1993) 27 (see also 21-26), who shows that Snell presupposes as true unity the 'unity of the soul... and so concludes that in overlooking the soul the early Greeks overlooked the only thing that could stop them breaking into mental parts'. See also Clark's more radical judgement, that 'pluralistic teaching about the soul [as in Nilsson (1949) 71-107] is founded in the human condition' and may account more efficiently for our mental processes than a unitary view (Clark 1990) 195. For an updated discussion of 'ancient selfhood' see Duncan (2006) 1-8. 4 Barbu (1960) 69-144. 5 Barbu (1960) 73. 6 Baibu (1960) 71. 7 Barbu (1960) 75 (my italics).</page><page sequence="15">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 5 fifty years - the mainstream philosophy of mind has been materialist and objectivist. A main preoccupation, still operative today, has been opposition to a Cartesian, dualistic, rationalist conception of the human mind and consciousness as res cogitans , dominating over matter, the body, res extensa. This preoccupation has also involved the rejection of Kantian 'individualistic' ethics, whereby the ethical subject produces his own law and behaves as if this law had a universal bearing. The risk involved in this anti-Cartesian preoccupation is of operating, still, within a Cartesian dualistic frame rather than correcting it, paradoxically causing what Searle has called 'the denial of simple and obvious truths about the mind', such as the fact that we have thoughts or intentions or feelings.8 There are different versions of this revisionist materialism, and it may be useful to list them here briefly:9 (a) Behaviourism, which dates back to the first decades of the last century. Any statement about mental states, according to this theory, can be translated into statements about behaviour. The mental, in practice, can be reduced to and identified with its external output. (b) Type identity theory, which claims that mental states of a certain type are only states of the brain and of the central nervous system of a certain corresponding type. Token-token identity theory offers a variant of the same view: every token instance of a mental state corresponds to some token neurophysiological instance. (c) Functionalism, whereby the mental is defined in terms of functional and causal relations within the life of a human being. (d) 'Strong artificial intelligence' theory, whereby mind and brain are taken to be comparable to the hardware and the software of a computer: a feature of the mind can be analysed without involving the study of the brain. The discipline of cognitive science originates from this approach. (e) Naturalizing content theory, according to which mental facts and features of consciousness can be easily naturalized and explained in material, non-mental terms. (f) Eliminative materialism, whereby consciousness and the mental can be ultimately 'eliminated'. The materialist-objectivist outlook has played a role in the latter-day reaction to Snell's claims, which these days are, of course, accepted as they stand by no-one. It is not indeed that Snell's critics are necessarily anti-Cartesians, in opposition to the Cartesian Snell. Students of classical thought, however, are increasingly ready to consider consciousness as a secondary feature, and the concept of person in the modern (post- Cartesian) sense as absent from the Greek view.10 Christopher Gill in particular has dealt with this issue in his Personality in Greek Epic , Tragedy and Philosophy. 11 Gill theorizes the link between (on the one hand) the Greeks' 'public' view of man and (on the other) a conception of social intercourse as necessary part of human self-definition, arguing that the two are synthesized in the definition of the Greek conception of man and moral life as 8 Searle (1992) xi. 9 Cf. Searle (1992) 5-57, Ostenfeld (1987) 10-17, Irwin (1991) 57. 10 There is probably not a (post-Kantian) concept of "person" in Greek philosophy' (Gill 1991, 193). 11 Gill (1996).</page><page sequence="16">6 HIDDEN PATHS 'objective-participant'.12 This label is especially useful in two respects: first, because reasons which are at the basis of human behaviour 'may not be fully available to the consciousness of the agent', and secondly because, for Gill, to be a human being is to 'participate in shared forms of human life and discourse', and to lead an ethical life which 'is expressed in a whole-hearted engagement with an interpersonal and communal role'.13 As a consequence, this 'objectivity' - which has a direct bearing, as we shall see, on the representation of human characters in Greek drama - has to be read not as an inability to 'grasp the true nature of a human being' or an inclination to 'praise or blame' men more than trying to understand them,14 but as the expression of an interpersonally and communally engaged view of human life, which shows itself openly, for instance, in tragedy on account of its public character.15 On two grounds, above all, the student of Greek tragedy can only applaud Gill's emphasis on the distance of the Greek 'public' view of man from the modern 'subjective- individualist view', grounded in the Kantian claim of the autonomous moral subject and the Cartesian idea of human person as the one 'understanding herself as the possessor of a unique personal identity'.16 This emphasis on the public helps us to come to terms with what is likely to appear to us as meagreness in sketching the tragic characters' inner life. At the same time, it helps to explain the fact that in tragedy 'circumstances are highly particular, characters highly normative',17 because the implicit conception of man is based on his social expression and his interpersonal relationships. And if human reasons are not always 'fully available to the consciousness of the agent', this implies the impossibility of fully presenting them to the audience, since they are neither provided for in the characters' utterances nor expected by the spectators. These revisionist proposals are indeed of great value. A focus on the third-person perspective as specifically Greek (Gill), and the acknowledgement, meanwhile, of the value and richness of the Greek presentation of man, as located in shared, communal virtues,18 serve the same end. These views certainly tend to promote the criticism of tragic character in particular, which is so strictly connected with a communal experience and a public dimension of artistic performance. To sum up, we have a choice between ( a ) a reading of psyche and body, spirit and matter, as separate, with the agent's mind and will prerequisite for a developed (and non- 'primitive') idea of man, and ( b ) a view of the relations between body and psyche as more articulated, along with an acknowledgement of the necessity and richness of openness and emotional response in human life. Common to many authorities who share this second position (differences notwithstanding) is the attempt to define human beings in terms of relationships and reactions (with others, with the world), rather than as units separable and 12 Gill (1996) 11. 13 Gill (1996) 11-12. 14 Wilamowitz (1907) 1 109-10 (as translated by Pelling 1990b, 245). 15 See also Easterling (1977) 129: 'the Greeks were interested in individuals as part of a community much more than in the individual's unique private experience'. 16 Gill (1996) II. 17 Pelling (1990b) 246. 18 As extensively argued by Nussbaumin The Fragility of Goodness (1986).</page><page sequence="17">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 7 analysable on their own.19 Such scholars find Greek tragedy or the Homeric poems the most plausible territory for this attempt. These 'revisionist' positions, nevertheless, refreshing and productive though they are, have certain limitations. First, our Geistesgeschichte often fails to consider literary texts and the history of the mind together, and instead randomly and instrumentally subordinates the former to the latter; secondly, even when it makes the attempt, it tends to disregard the literal level and the poetic nature of the texts, to consider them only as 'contents' without form, contents we can sufficiently understand by philosophical or practical reason alone. Thirdly, and consequently, by inserting ancient contributions into the modern debate, it ignores the necessary historical and artistic distance; that is, in (one might say) neo-Aristotelian fashion, it universalizes: it reads the story of a tragic hero as if it were the human life of any man, which we can ourselves directly relate to. An instructive example is Nussbaum's reading of the chorus' narrative about the king in Aeschylus' Agamemnon 184-257.20 She thinks that the main point in the chorus' commentary on the king is their critical attitude towards his willingness to be the butcher of his daughter (215-17). The king's deliberations, in the chorus' words, are narrated thus:21 215 TTap0£viou 0' aLpaToç òp- yâ TTepiópytp o&lt;p' èmQv- I ±eïv ©épis1, eu yap €ÏT|. It is right that one should desire the blood of the young maiden with rage beyond rage. So be it. The choral elders (on Nussbaum's view) are emphasizing Agamemnon's lack of human response to necessity. On this reading, the more emotional aspect of an ethical issue - which Plato, for Nussbaum,22 disregarded - is foregrounded by the tragedian, who acknowledges the 'fragility', and richness through fragility, of human experience. Agamemnon's guilt is not so much that he became the sacrificer of his daughter, 'but that he endured to become. He put up with it; he did not struggle against it'.23 An analogous comment on this passage was made by Vernant: 'the oracle of Artemis that Calchas transmits is not imposed upon the king as a categorical imperative. It does not say "sacrifice your daughter", but simply "if you want the winds they must be paid for with the blood of your child". By submitting to this, without in any way questioning the monstrosity of it, the king shows that the life and love of his daughter cease to count for him the moment that they become an obstacle to the warlike expedition of which he has assumed command'.24 19 As summarized by Searle (1992, 248): 'we need to rediscover the social character of the mind' [my emphasis]. 20 'Aeschylus and practical conflict', in Nussbaum (1986) 25-50. 21 Here, and at pp. 37-38, 1 am quoting the text followed by Nussbaum (Denniston and Page 1957). 22 E.g. Nussbaum (1986) 5 on 'the Platonic conception of a self-sufficient and purely rational being, cleansed of the "barnacles" and the "seaweed" of passion ... freed from contingent limitations on his power'. 23 Nussbaum (1986) 37. 24 Vernant (1988a) 73.</page><page sequence="18">8 HIDDEN PATHS Vernant proceeds from the same 'accusation' against the king. At line 186, the chorus recalls how the king, in Aulis, did not dare contest Calchas' prescription (jiavTiv oimva ifjey gov, 'blaming no seer'): Agamemnon did not try hard enough to find an alternative to the murder of Iphigenia. If this reading is presented as the main meaning of Agamemnon's avayKas1 eôu XeiraSvov ('putting on the yoke-strap of compulsion')25 it is banalizing and disregards the distance between our view of the role of man in the world and the Greeks'. Moreover, it disregards 'the literary tradition in which Agamemnon plays a part'26 - as indeed all dramatic characters in Greek tragedy arc part of a long tradition. As Goldhill rightly suggests, there is a reference here to Iliad I 106-20, in the light of which 'blaming no seer' has to be read: in Homer, Agamemnon is 'all too ready to blame a seer', so that his compulsion to obey the oracle - not to consider the possibility of ignoring it - in Agamemnon has a deeper background: the meaning of the scene has to be found in 'the juxtaposition and difference of literary representation'.27 This is only one example of the limitations of Geistesgeschichte as applied to Greek tragedy's portrayal of man. Laudable as its aim might be ('to combine the exploration of Greek thinking about selfhood and personality with the re-examination of our own ideas on this subject' is Gill's stated objective28), the student of tragedy still finds it difficult not to perceive the representation of tragic character as cold, distant and crude, and the attempts to narrow the distance by reading Agamemnon as 'moral agent' in our sense as not legitimate. There is on the one hand the same risk of superimposition of modern parameters and bias as Snell's 'evolutionist' view implied; on the other, attention towards the literal in the text is instrumental; no account is made of wider artistic implications or aims, no regard for religious, aesthetic or traditional données , no room for ambiguity or debate. The modern debates about consciousness, intentionality, the idea of individual as idiosyncratic and unrepeatable, the relationship between mind and body, and between internal and external world, still seem to suffer, as Searle rightly pointed out vis-à-vis the mind-body debate, from a prejudice which allows only two alternatives for defining mind and self and, ultimately, for what it means to be human: a view which gives priority to consciousness, individuality, ethical autonomy at the expense of the external world, or else a view which disregards all these features in favour of the external (relationship with others, objective reality, luck).29 The second option is the one preferred by the - now - mainstream, and largely materialistic, approach. What underlines both approaches, however, is the conviction that the two alternatives are to be straightforwardly opposed: consciousness as irreducible feature of human life, and the external world (with its positivistic implications of objectivity). A fruitful third approach should seek to overcome the opposition or choice between mental consciousness and objective reality. The mental and the objective are not alternatives in Greek thought - or anyway? - and the notion of a continuum between man 2S A.Ag. 218. 26 Goldhill (1990) 124. 27 Goldhill (1990) 125. 28 Gill (1996) 4. 29 See Searle (1992) 1-64.</page><page sequence="19">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 9 and world should be utilized to the maximum degree to explicate the study of character in drama.30 An attempt to bridge the gap between the objective and the mental side of experience was made by Clarke in his Flesh and Spirit in the Songs of Homert In this study Clarke considers Homeric instances of mental life and images of life after death, focusing on '0u|ióç-family' terms and on t|wxf| ('life', 'spirit', 'soul') mindful of the inadequacy (in particular for a reading of Homer) of the mind-body dualism which informs our culture. His reading aims at demonstrating the fundamental unity of mind and body in the Homeric poems, in contrast to the use of tfwxf) as seat of the inner self which survives physical death in other archaic poets, such as Pindar and Hesiod. Clarke deduces from this the cultural anteriority of the Homeric poems.32 On his reading, the opposing of mind and body is located at the level of the visible (the mortal experience) as against the mythical (the representation of the afterlife, which is irreconcilable with it). What he calls a 'logic of creativity' or 'creative imagery' {e.g. the 'flying ¡¡jvxti')33 is the connection between the ontological level - the fundamental Homeric unity of mind and body - and those presentations where we seem to recognize a pattern of iļwxf) as soul of man surviving death. In effect, Clarke reduces the mind/body problem, which, as he rightly puts it, is identical to all 'personification modes' of Greek culture (as, say, Helios is both god and sun), to a matter of literary imagination. However, the lack of emphasis on the connection between the visible and the mythological level should be admitted at least as possible evidence for the obviousness of the connection itself. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, he fails to consider the chief Homeric word for a person's identity, which grants a continuity between, in Clarke's terms, the sublunar condition of body-soul unity and the 'mythological' imagery of the surviving shade: the proper name of each hero, for which Homer offers the strongest taste through repetition and epithets. Clarke's position is of particular interest here because it reveals, again, a reluctance to escape a choice between the two spheres (his 'visible' and 'mythical') and shows the need for a reading which shifts the focus from the 'visible', as the basic reality, to a consideration of the worldview implicit in every instance and considered in continuity with the perception of the self. A history of the representation of self in a culture cannot be written with the 'view of man' considered as something separate from 'the view of the world' as a whole, as if it were possible to abstract one from the other. The portrayal of self in Greek literature is strictly dependent on a strong belief in a world organized as a system of which man is part , and on the changes this belief undergoes. Many of the seeming oddities in character 30 This notion has indeed been profitably explored by many scholars: see e.g. Lesky (1966) 78: 'characteristically Aeschylean union of fatal necessity and personal will'; Easterling (1973) 6: 'simultaneous understanding of supernatural and human causation'; Jones (1962) 209 on 'Oedipus' manner of shifting between "I was fated" and "I have doomed myself'. [The two are] probably not even conceived as alternatives'. We shall pursue the exploration further. 31 Clarke (1999). 32 Clarke (1999) 284-319. 33 Clarke (1999) 277.</page><page sequence="20">10 HIDDEN PATHS representation there can be explained in connection with such a belief. Correspondingly, the change in the representation of individuals that we notice later in the development of Greek drama and in particular in Euripides, as we shall see, are to be read in terms of a change in the balance within the continuum of man and world. Another example of the limitations of the mind/body opposition, which underlies most readings of psychological categories among the Greeks, is offered by Vernant's article on will, choice and responsibility in Greek tragedy, which firmly rejects Snell's and Snell's followers' thesis on tragedy as the birthplace of Greek individuality and free will. Partly following a lexical method, Vernant denies to Greek tragedy 'the idea of a free power of decision'34 and 'our concept of duty,... responsibility,... obligation'. 35 Looking back to the pre-legal stage of Greek society, he points out that 'the individual as such is not the main factor in a crime: "the crime exists outside him, it is objective'".36 He further states that 'the action does not emanate from the agent as from its source: rather, it envelops him and carries him away'.37 These remarks certainly contain some truth, but they would be more fruitful if framed in the perspective of a continuity between man and world, rather than keeping the parameters of opposition between objective reality and subjective mind and then denying features that are surely irreducible aspects of human life: 'we indeed find choice and responsibility based on intention in a Greek such as Aristotle but what is lacking, precisely, is will'.38 The prejudicial dichotomy between man and world is evident when Vernant discusses the issue of choice and supernatural determination in Clytemnestra's apology at Agamemnon 1501 and her reference to the dXaoTcop (the 'avenging spirit of the family'), as actually culpable for her crime: 'the nature of tragic action appears to us to be defined by the simultaneous presence of a "self' and something greater that is divine at work at the core of the decision creating a constant tension between the two opposed poles' ;39 the two are 'opposed but complementary aspects'.40 I believe the right reading is to be formulated in the opposite way: there is no tension or opposition between two poles here, but rather a continuity of human (Clytemnestra) and outside world (the aXdcjToop, the crime committed, the story of the family, and so on). As a matter of method, we should in any case aim to focus on the letter of the text, not only on its abstracted contents as if separable from the rest, and consider the specific traits of a tragedy as work of dramatic art, and not only as historical event.

Despite the different versions of that 'view of man' and the problematic nature of our access to it - mainly through the texts - there are characteristic aspects that remain constant in the literary embodiments from Homer to tragedy. First, there is a continuity between subject and object and an analogy between man and world which is typical of pre-Platonic Greek thought. Greek presentations in this early period tend to assume an image of man as 'microcosm [that] mirrors the macrocosm',41 as one who is ruled by the same principles and rhythms of life as the world outside. Anaximenes' theory of air encompassing the world and shaping its order, just as t|mxf), here 'soul' or 'breath', gives life and governs the human body by moving in and out of human beings, offers a good example of this principle: olov r' cjnļaiv, f] TļļiēTepa àfìp ovaa avyKpaTCÍ fipâç, Kal ö'ov top koojiov TTwOpa Kal ař'p Trepiéx^i, 'as our soul, being air, holds us together, so do breath and air surround the whole universe'.42 Thus the border between man and world as patterned by the human mind is more elusive than in our modern perception; as Sharpies has pointed out, 'the line between self and the external world is less clear than for us'.43 The bases on which this outlook is founded are, on the one hand, the belief in a systemic world, animated by superior forces that, although bewildering, are orientated towards a worldly harmony;44 and on the other hand, a perception of 'human innerness' - a conventional term I shall adopt from now on - as composite, highly receptive, and situational. Each of these three qualities will be treated in detail in due course. For the moment, we may note that the variety of specialized organs of reception and seats of feeling in the depiction of men ('composite'), and, even more, the overlapping of the two functions of actively feeling and passively undergoing an external influence ('receptive'), shape an image of human innerness as extremely 'porous' and reactive.45 Such innerness is more a place of transit for immediate emotive experiences ('situational') than a self-sufficient individuality opposed to them. 41 Sullivan (1995) 103-05; see also Rohde (1925) 365. 42 Fr. B2 D-K. 43 Shaiples (1983) 4. 44 All Presocratic philosophers share a view of the world as ordered, shaped as a system, and understandable by men despite the variety of positions and the disagreements between thinkers. Some theorize a single dpxri ('origin', 'supreme power') as principle and substance of the world (water for Thaïes, air for Anaximenes, the dTreipov, literally 'boundless'/ 'endless' for Anaximander). Some define the cosmic order as a balance or composition of elements (the four elements harmonized or in conflict, in alternating phases of Love and Hate, in Empédocles; strife as foundational of reality in Heraclitus; the atomistic conception of Democritus). Some refer to a hidden, upper ontological level (number for Pythagoras, Being for Parmenides). 45 Cf. Padel (1992) 40-44; 58-59. Padel felicitously uses the adjective 'porous' to describe a view of mind as sensitive to and subject to external influences.</page><page sequence="22">12 HIDDEN PATHS Secondly, and consequently to the first point, there is the overbearing presence of the world in human self-definition in Greek dramatic' literature up to and including earlier tragedy, as we shall see through a number of examples. By 'dramatic' I mean all literature that displays actions of third persons as seen acting , and does not take the form of first- person narrative (regardless of whether this first person is fictive and conventional or not). The stable presence of a chorus, or of some functional equivalent, objectifies the action in all such literature.46 This distinction between 'dramatic' and first-person literary texts is very important for my argument, as first-person texts (like some lyric poetry) do not show the rule that wherever a strong view of the world as a system is held, self-inwardness is less developed. Finally, we must consider the implications of this verbal and substantial continuity of individual and world for the tragic genre in particular. This will be discussed later in the chapter, where we shall argue that the flatness that modern readers are tempted to find in tragic characters is due to the Greeks' normative view of man as opposed to our idiosyncratic one. We shall also argue that tragedy, in particular, differs from other genre s in its tendency to show an exemplary dimension, partly related to its public character, to the conventions of masking and of the chorus, and to the use of epic-mythological figures as characters. In considering the evolution in the portrayal of human psychology in Greek literature, it is important to grasp these premises as fundamental elements of the Greek worldview, albeit without any rigid contrast between an 'archaic world' and a 'classical world'. A change in the perception of psychological individuality is a change in the view of the world and of the place of man in it, and vice versa. This mutual dependence deeply impinges on literary relationships (our main interest here), such as the relationship in tragedy between (on the one hand) characterization and (on the other) plot, actor and chorus.47 An exhaustive and detailed treatment of the view of the world as system, to begin with, is neither possible here nor necessary. Nevertheless, the idea of a deep and unitary order underlying the visible world can be easily detected throughout the development of late-archaic Greek literature. From the Presocratics to Pindar, an unshakeable faith in the order of the world balances the chaotic appearance of nature and the incomprehensibility of human fate; the appeal to a system of values and to an ideal of reparatory justice is also present in tragedy, up to and including Medea and Hippolytus. Heraclitus in particular offers interesting parallels with the poets' treatment of human matters, especially where his cosmological conceptions coincide with what we would call 'ethics'. In fr. 80B he says: eiôévai 8è xpA T^v nóXepov èóvTa Çwóv, Kai ôíktív epiv, Kai yivò[ieva TTCtvTa KaT ' 6piv Kai xptúv ('we have to bear in mind that struggle is common [to both sides], and that justice is conflict, and that everything happens according to the rules of conflict and necessity'). In the light of this fragment, the modern reader can better appreciate one of the impressive traits of Greek literature and mythology, namely its 46 See, for example, the analysis of 7¿s-speeches' in the Iliad by de Jong (1987). De Jong suggests that these have the function of 'reflecting the psychology of the speaker who projects them' (81), of 'making clear the moods and motives of the characters'. They are compared in function to the chorus in tragedy by Fingerle (1939) 289. 47 See Chapter 1.9, pp. 52-57.</page><page sequence="23">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 1 3 descriptive and objective quality, and the consequent impossibility of having (as we might prefer) a clear-cut sympathetic and ethical response in favour of one of the two sides of a confrontation.48 The appeal to the world as witness and point of reference that we observe in literature - our second premise - is also rooted in this analogy between man and cosmos , in the belief that 'we are made, body and mind, of the same stuff as the world outside us',49 a world with precise rules and rhythms. By 'appeal to the world' I mean all the utterances which tend to project an individual issue onto a general, paradigmatic level; and all the moments or scenes where a character literally addresses himself or herself to (or longs for the attention of) the gods or the natural elements as witnesses. From Homer and Hesiod to the Pindaric ode, to cite major examples, an ultimate faith in the order of things is claimed. This deep creed is kept up in tragedy, where it is developed through the addressing of the forces of nature as warrant of sanity and justice, and through many reflections of a universal nature. Although it is a critical commonplace that the stable Aeschylean heaven is progressively discredited in a process culminating in Euripides' sceptical, if not ironic, vision of the divine Olympian world, I would locate the novelty of the younger playwright's thought more in its lack of trust in an easy, direct communion with or comprehension of the cosmos , than in an undervaluing of its order in favour of an interest in private human issues.50 Such a belief in a cosmic order, as we have suggested, is strictly interlaced with a conception of human innerness as composite, receptive, and attached to the situation, so that it is possible to describe its processes and motivations from the outside. This vision might leave the modern reader with the impression of a superficial and artificial portrait of psychological processes, even irrespective of genre. In (for instance) Archilochus' ff. 128, which we shall analyse shortly, as also in the tragic depictions of Euripides' Medea and Phaedra, we witness an internal struggle at which the subject seems sometimes merely to be in attendance; in the presentations of Aeschylus' Orestes, Sophocles' Ajax and Euripides' Heracles, a disturbing psychological element is even concretized as an external 48 This quality is described by Simone Weil as follows: 'It is in this that the Iliad is absolutely unique, in this bitterness that proceeds from tenderness and that spreads over the whole human race, impartial as sunlight... Nothing precious is scorned, whether or not death is its destiny; everyone's unhappiness is laid bare without dissimulation or disdain; no man is set above or below the condition common to all men; whatever is destroyed is regretted. Victors and vanquished are brought equally near us; under the same head, both are seen as counterparts of the poet, and the listener as well. If there is any difference, it is that the enemy's misfortunes are possibly more sharply felt' (Weil 1983, 28-29). 49 Padel (1992) 43. 50 From this perspective, the debate about a 'rationalist' or 'irrationalist' Euripides (because of his innovative views on the gods) tends to lose meaning. What is central is the new place occupied by men in the world and men's flawed understanding of it. Pigeaud (1987, 51) finely formulates the logic of such explorations: 'In fact the issue, the great issue which occupied Greek antiquity so early, is to save God, to render God not responsible for evil. Greek thought, under this respect, is a theodicy ... It is tragic thought which justly has to contemplate the scandal of a god acting beyond any measure: a god who is also the origin of evil itself ... It has been said that Greek rationalism was born in opposition to divinity, that science analogously formed itself and was formulated in opposition to it.. .However, one can invert the proposition ... even though acknowledging... the construction of rationalist discourse... So perhaps we shall see the celebrated Greek rationalism, in general narrowly conceived as the victory of reason over the irrational and the divine, as instead born from the great enterprise of justifying, saving God' (my translation).</page><page sequence="24">14 HIDDEN PATHS phenomenon.51 Ultimately, however, in all these cases the systemic quality of the world is 'safeguarded' by placing the contradiction within the individual, and confining it to a part of the self. If we are to engage fully with these claims, it is important to pay special attention to representation of those forms of internal turmoil which place a human being on a level that seems exceptional both to himself or herself and to others. Let us now consider Archilochus 128: 0upé, 0up' aprix^01^ KT|8ecriv KUKOjpeve, t avaSeu Suapevcov t 8* àXéÇeo TTpoaßaXcov evavTiov orépvov t èvôoKoiaiv èxÔpûv ttXt|(jlov KaTaoTaOeiç àcrcfxiXécôÇ' Kai pf|T6 vikéîùv àp&lt;J&gt;á8r|i&gt; àyáXXeo, pr|8è uiKT)06i? 6v o'l ku) KaTaTT€a(í)v ò8úpeo, àXXd xaPT°tatv Te xatPe Kai KaKoiaiv àaxáXa pf] Xlt]v, ytvco aKe 8' 0Î09 puapòç àp0poí)TTou9 £X6L-52 Heart, my heart, with helpless, sightless troubles now confounded up, withstand the enemy, opposing breast to breast. All round they lie in wait, but stand you firmly grounded, not over-proud in victory, nor in defeat oppressed. In your rejoicing let your joy, in hardship your despairs be tempered: understand the pattern shaping men's affairs. As in Homeric epic, the poet addresses his 0upóç ('soul', 'life', 'heart'),53 treating it by analogy as an individual which can 'put out its chest', behave socially, and lie down at home in anguish. The poet urges his 0upóç itself to understand the rhythm which rules human life. The nexus between man and world is here reaffirmed, despite a concomitant sense of mystery; and the seemingly fragmentary form of the proposed view of the psyche, far from entailing any superficiality of motivations, 'confines' Archilochus' troubles to a part of himself only, the 0upos' the seat of immediate and violent feelings. We can note in our examples from tragedy the same distancing strategy towards disturbing psychological elements.54 Medea , Hippolytus , Orestes , Ajax and Heracles all contain instances of human madness. In the first three plays the madness is confined to a part of the person only, which ends up prevailing over the rest. In the other two plays madness is transferred in toto onto the level of divine personified influence. In Medea , first of all, the self-referential mechanism is overwhelming.

The decisive action is central to the character's consciousness, and its enormity can be made bearable only by placing it in a secluded part of the whole person 'Medea', which struggles against the other parts. The world is invoked to suggest a witnessing of the choice made, via appeals to the gods as guardians of justice (Zeus, 148, 169; Themis, 169; Hecate, 397; all the divinities, 746-47; Dike, Zeus and Helios, 764), and via generalized claims (about the dangers of judging people in a prejudicial manner, 215 ff.; about the status of women, 230 ff.; about the impossibility of neatly recognizing the value of men from their appearance as one does with gold, 516-19); there is a system of values that Medea firmly holds, and the final accounts have to be right according to these values.

The presence of the world here is overwhelming, amongst the woman's hopes of deliverance. Such resort to the world was a comforting witness to Medea's thought process; it is for Phaedra a source of sanity and evasion from an unacceptable reality. At 208-1 1, 215-18, 672, the use of natural images conveys this view of the natural, the wild, the environment, as a defence against a feared part of the self. The general discourse which I drew attention to in Medea is also present (375-87, on the ruin of mortal lives). In Orestes too the distancing mechanism is at work. Euripides' portrayal of a madman, though, is placed in a sense midway between the Aeschylean Orestes (where the externality of guilt is complete and personified in the mother's furious Erinyes) and the portrayal of Pentheus (where it is so internalized that we can only see, dramatically, its behavioural utterances). Orestes in Euripides' play has momentary crises and visions, which are concretely present for him but are not acknowledged as such by others (258-59; 314-15). At the same time he recognizes these hallucinations as part of his crúveai?, his intellect, personal yet externalized (395-96): Me.

My intellect - 1 am conscious of having done awful things. He feels ashamed and lost when he realizes that he is not in control of his behaviour (281-82), and his words reveal his oscillation between sanity and delirium. He is ultimately conscious of a loss of consciousness: tò acopa &lt;f&gt;poû8ov, tò 8 'övop ' ou XéXoLTTé pe ('my body is passed away - but my name has not deserted me', at 390). More explicitly and fully externalized are the representations of madness in Ajax and Heracles. In Ajax , madness is sent by Athena as part of a specific vendetta against the hero, and we do not observe Ajax's derangement directly; his raging is described by other characters. The hero speaks only when his fateful deed has been committed, and a feeling of shame accompanies the helplessness for an action felt as totally self-alienated, opas* tòv 0pa auv, 'you see the brazen one!', he exclaims (364). Heracles' madness reveals itself as an external force as well, namely Lyssa, who intervenes suddenly, and seemingly independently, with the entire éxodos devoted to the hero's awakening and sense of shame. The role and effect of mania in the human world is affirmed in all these instances. Phaedra and Ajax do not survive madness; they die because of choices they have made. Orestes, Medea and Heracles do survive, with diverse outcomes. Heracles, however painfully, profits on a human level. Medea benefits in the fulfilment of her need for revenge.56 With Orestes, finally, a helpless view of human fate as chaotic and of no ultimate sense is implicit, but the need for a final order seems to appear at the end, even though in an ironic light, in the rushed weddings promoted by the god. 56 See also 138 Iff.: a rite is established to commemorate the slaughter, and to underline the unfathomable fairness of conflict.</page><page sequence="27">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 17 This order, we would emphasize, ought to involve the stability of external elements (the social or political frame, for instance) as well as the psychological level: the two, the inner and the external, are contiguous, and it would be misleading to consider such order as exclusively socio-political at the expense of the spiritual. Seaford, in his reading of Greek tragedy and the Homeric poems, applies a historical approach grounded on the acknowledgement of the importance of state-formation.57 On these grounds, he identifies in ritual and reciprocity the kernel of the world-order which finds expression in the two genre s of tragedy and epic; different versions of ritual and reciprocity in them correspond to two different stages in the process towards the formation of the polis. In both genres , he argues, crises always involve a 'failure or anomaly of ritual ... but also of reciprocity';58 in both, the key is the struggle to create the polis against the excesses of the ruling family. On my reading, the political moment is a part, or an expression, of the creed in a strong world-order which characterizes the outlook of the Greeks up to and including the classic era, but cannot be taken as the main explanation, cause or objective of such a creed. We have proposed that a composite representation of mind implies a relationship with nature and cosmos. A similar attitude, in fact, can be detected in Homer. The characteristic 'over-information' offered to the reader by Homeric narrative, from qualifying formulae to paratactic and abundant themes (which may seem inconsequential to modern readers), cannot help but stand out in contrast to the apparent simplicity of inner dialogue. Such detail is symptomatic of what one might call a taste for the world, which is found in various forms in Greek literature, and cannot be dismissively explained in terms of orality and formulaicness. We can find an example of this tendency to subjectivize the world - the obverse of the Snellian concept of a 'deficient', objectified self - in II. I, 149-71, Achilles' irate reply to Agamemnon. The message contained in these twenty-two lines can be summarized thus: 'You are a miserable man. We are all here to risk our lives for your sake. I am the one on whom victory depends, and you are stealing my deserved prize. I shall leave.' We have, throughout this piece, an accumulation of arguments, specifications, analytic digressions, and things , which may appear superfluous. In these things , however, much of the overall psychology of the situation is contained: the memory of exhausting battle (151), the thought of a faraway homeland, which was not involved in Agamemnon's (or Menelaus') motivations against the Trojans (155-60), the condition of the 'anonymous' fellow-soldiers, with whom Achilles now prefers to be on equal terms, rather than with the chief of the expedition. In this list of facts, Achilles speaks only once about himself and his own feelings, at 171, claiming that he is dishonoured, cmpoç - which is a social and public condition, more than an expression of personal humiliation. Nevertheless, through the element of world presented in his speech,59 his feelings and thoughts emerge. From objective data, the subject Achilles and his motivations are 57 Seaford (1994). See also Hammer's reading of Iliad as a work of political thought, and in particular of the figure of Achilles in terms of political-historical development (Hammer 2002, especially 96-1 13). 58 Seaford (1994) xvii. 50 Webster (1953 and 1954) discusses related material with particular reference to the personification of abstractions or inanimate objects as a Greek mode of thought. He argues that the personification of inanimate things is a 'means of taking hold of things which suddenly appear uncontrollable and independent' (1954, 1 1), and that 'two assumptions seem to be practically universal in Greek thought, that the world is in some sense personal and that the human mind is a person' (1954, 16).</page><page sequence="28">18 HIDDEN PATHS constructed, and the world is invoked to testify to the wrong suffered and to the fairness of his claims. These explorations are offered by way of contextualizing the problematic place occupied among the Greeks by the psychological categories of 'in' and 'out' of the mind, crucial as far as characteriological instantiations are concerned. The importance of the world as organized system of reference in human self-definition, and the 'open, receptive and situational* conception of the mind, are strictly interdependent, in a way not allowed by our modern unitary view of the self as legislator, independent of the world if not, indeed, opposed to it in a Cartesian sense. 1.3 Readings of character The problematic distance between the view of man and self expressed in literary instances and actual human beings is a crucial point within the history of literary-critical ideas. During the last two centuries, critical positions regarding the interpretation of character in literature seem to have tended towards one of two poles, depending on the philosophical premises adopted and the relevance attached either to the literary, textual aspect of the question or to the interplay between the work of art and its cultural context. Hunter offers an exemplary comparison between two readings of character in Shakespeare, one from the early eighteenth century - by G. Stubbes - and one from the beginning of the twentieth century - by A. C. Bradley.60 In the first, characters are treated as 'above all an element of the scene', classified 'according to a set of primarily rhetorical rules and norms that determine what counts as a plausible and appropriate characterization'.61 Such terms as 'Reason' and 'Nature' appear as parameters for the appropriateness of the representation. In Bradley, on the contrary, character is read as a 'moral object', rather than 'a representation, a projection or correlate of the reader's moral self and personality'. Broadly in the spirit of one or other of these two orientations, some interpreters have stressed the necessity of considering characters in the 'round', as if they were real human beings; others have stressed their status as artificial product, whose fictiveness is agreed and evident to the audience.62 They are read, according to this second perspective, either as carrying further meanings (like a symbolic reference to wider classes or to abstract concepts) or as being secondary to the aim and the structure of the work as a whole. Wilson's sketch of approaches to character offers a more detailed schema:63 1) characters are considered as if they were actual persons; 2) characters are seen as entirely artificial, to be analysed only in terms of compositional techniques; 3) characters are regarded as a function of the text in which they appear, as embodiments of themes or ideas; 4) characters are considered primarily as a product of the author's mind; 5) the 60 Hunter (1983) 228 quoting Stubbes (1736) and Bradley (1904), from Vickers (1975). 61 Hunter (1983) 229. 62 Such a contrast still seems to be seen as the most urgent one in criticism of character. See Wilson (1975a) and Price (1975-76) respectively on the necessity of 'the absolute distinction between characters and actual persons' (194) and the 'puritanical fear of [round] character' (377). The one between 'flat' and 'round' character is Forster' s distinction, whereas the first is similar to caricature and type and is 'constructed around a single idea or quality', and the second is articulated and capable to develop (1963, 75). 63 Wilson (1979) 730.</page><page sequence="29">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 1 9 existence of characters is denied altogether.64 Here 3) and 5) may be seen as sub- categories of 2), with 4) probably an eccentric sub-category of 1), so that our main two- term opposition is seen to be, still, determinative. The humanist-behaviourist' understanding of literary characters (position 1) tends to treat them as if they were actual persons, who lead an autonomous off-stage life, and whose choices and actions are rooted in an implied but not expressed background, which the reader has to guess and reconstruct. This 'assumption of the excess of character over the formal means of its representation'65 is seen as due to the unavoidable limitations of representation inherent in any art work, but also as a more general consequence of the elusiveness of human nature, which 'remains a mystery, subject to obscure forces; it is a universe in itself and we are strangers even to ourselves':66 the discussion is thus moved onto the level of the broader view of man which underlies the artistic expression, but at the expense of the literary and technical issues proper to the work of art as such. The structuralist perspective is perhaps the most clear-cut instance of the second class of theories; adopting an opposite position, it conceives characters as textual phenomena to be analysed as a 'permanent group of functions and qualities and by their distribution through a narrative'.67 Here the reader-onlooker plays a chief, active role in determining the very existence of character, insofar as it is 'as much the reader's reconstruction as a textual construct'.68 This approach seeks to investigate a set of features which may work as markers in building characters; these characteristics involve not only textual elements, but also the relationships with other characters and with such modalities as 'knowing' and 'wanting', the distribution of relevant items within the whole narrative, the themes connected to them. The consequence, however, is an evasion of the problem raised by character inter- pretation and, even more, by the priority traditionally given to this strand of criticism, by reducing it to a mere ideological prejudice.69 The immediate, 'popular' level of reading is dismissed, even though it is the most spontaneous and common, and should therefore be regarded as a datum for a theory that focuses on the reader's active role and seeks to define character as a textual effect, as a 'combination of semes' in the reader's understanding.70 Following this second line of interpretation, we can find more specific notions worked out in particular about drama. By calling it a 'line of interpretation' I obviously do not 64 See e.g. Cixous (1974), who disregards characterization in literature as being 'a product of a restriction of the imaginary': 'character excludes in advance the open, unpredictable, piercing part of the subject'. Here the legitimacy of the very notion of character is itself questioned: 'character has a sense only as a figure that can be used in semiotics: the "personage" functions as a social sign, in relation to other signs, within a text which, if it admits of the existence of "character", necessarily goes back to pure representationalism' (384). 65 Frow (1986) 229. See this work, and Rimmon-Kenan (1989) 29-42 for a review of approaches to literary character. 66 Surmelian (1968) 139. 67 Greimas (1966). 68 Hamon (1977) 1 19. 69 Culler (1975) 230. 70 Barthes (1974).</page><page sequence="30">20 HIDDEN PATHS mean a school of similar theories, but a wider class of interpretations, which present major internal differences, and which are not necessarily grounded on structuralist premises. As Frow' s rather different review of critical positions shows, a historicist or neo-Hegelian approach to the criticism of character offers an alternative to the opposition between the 'humanist' and the structuralist view, by taking into account how 'forms of literary characters have drawn upon and fed back into folk psychologies and characterologies . . . and how they are linked to techniques of formation of moral character located within particular institutions'.71 Psychoanalysis also offers a further elaboration of the concept of character as linked to the reader's active expectations, in terms of a 'dissolution of the concept into the fluidity of libidinal forces in play in the text',72 and also provides a link between the representation of character and the subconscious of the author, as in Wilson's category 4). All these perspectives have in common an opposition to the naturalistic quest for 'round' character as an almost-alive human presence leading a personal, independent life, which was axiomatic particularly in the later nineteenth century.73 They also agree in rejecting the detextualization of characters and in pointing towards the contextual nature of their meaning. 1.4 Notions of tragic character Turning to the narrower field of dramatic criticism, and criticism of Greek drama in particular, we need to draw special attention to certain other issues. The first, which we have mentioned already, is the meagreness in portraying characters in Greek tragedy. The onlooker or reader seems to be dealing more with a partial, 'flat' figure, completely functional to the action or only expressed in its relationship with the context and with the other figures of the play, than with a complete personality, which possesses an individual inner life and an autonomous set of motivations and feelings. This sort of 'objectivity' in representing character has provoked various interpretative responses,74 according to which these figures, rather than being depicted as probable human beings, endowed with a complete and plausible personality proportionate to the extraordinary situations they have to cope with, seem to be closer to a kind of exemplary dimension.75 Various critical notions have been worked out along such lines, including the 'flat character or type', with reference to the one-sided and sometimes inexplicable aspect of the behaviour of the stage figures, and the symbol, whereby characters are interpreted as embodiments of human virtues, political or social groups, and so on.76 These perspectives aim to explain the unroundness and inflexibility of characters by reading 71 Frow (1986) 233-35. 72 Frow ( 1 986) 235. 73 See Garton (1972b) 389. These naturalistic readings were famously challenged (in the Field of Shakespearian criticism) by Knights, who proposed to read Shakespeare's plays primarily as 'dramatic poems' centred on 'his use of language to obtain a total complex emotional response' (6), rather than submitting to the fascination of his 'real as life' characters (1) (Knights 1946, 1-39). 74 Garton (1957). 75 Easterling (1990) 90. 76 Garton (1957) 249. See, representatively, Greenwood's description and criticism of symbolist theory as applied to Euripides' representations of the gods (1953, 32-58).</page><page sequence="31">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 21 them as exemplary depictions, poetic means finalized in the staged events; they do not help, though, to explain the irrational or incongruous elements in characters and, if anything, they tend to estrange the single figure from the tragic plot even more than the 'humanistic' conception of character as real presence. Another critical perspective worth noting in this connection is one stigmatized by Garton as the 'chameleon view', according to which characters are, so to speak, 'creatures of the situation', whose behaviour and discourse change as a mere function of the dramatic purpose within the scenic context. This view, which tries to take particular account of the 'inconsistency' sometimes shown by tragic characters77 may be traced back to the influential work of Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff on Sophocles,78 which reacted against the critical 'naturalism' that was mainstream in the reading of tragic character at the end of the nineteenth century. Partly appealing to Aristotle's remarks on the subordination of character to plot, and rejecting, in particular, psychological objections to perceived incoherence and inconsistency, the younger Wilamowitz proposed an approach - sometimes labelled 'Tychoism' - which reads tragic character as part of the effect of the single dramatic scene, with no criticism for inconsistency allowed: within this scene, the playwright's aim is to 'produce as powerful an impression as possible upon the spectator'.79 This perspective offers the advantage of taking into account the link between the stage figures and the wider complex of dramatic action and discourse. At the same time, it is subject to the drastic limitation of confining this link to the over-fragmented and variable effectiveness of the single scene, disregarding any consideration for the play as a whole and reducing character to a mere literary expedient. A first step towards a plausible reconciliation between the divergent approaches of naturalistic reading and Tychoism has been taken by Gill, who opposes the theatrical persona as monolithic object of criticism to the 'viewpoints'80 or angles from which the reader or critic seeks to read and interpret it. Gill offers this distinction along with another, a distinction between 'character' and 'personality'. For Gill, these categories can be used to illuminate the dramatic persona - and, more generally, the literary representation of man. According to the 'character view-point', the person is treated as a rational being, whose actions reflect his beliefs, desires and intentions. Rationality and self-consistency are implicit assumptions of this perspective. The 'personality view-point', on the other hand, posits a gap between a man's actions and his intentions or beliefs, and invites the reader to identify with the emotive status of the person rather than to judge him. Applying the character-personality distinction to the three tragedians' works, Gill shows that a rigid choice of either one of these two viewpoints would be limiting and unsatisfactory, and that it is more appropriate to speak in terms of 'aspects, stances, functions'.81 On these 77 The traditional paradigm of this 'inconsistency' is M, already stigmatized by Aristotle for the heroine's unresolved change of mind from desperation to proud determination to be sacrificed (Po. 1454 a 7). 78 T. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (1917); E. Howald, in his Die Griechische Tragödie (1930) eventually extended this interpretation to most of Greek tragedy. See also Dawe (1963) for a more recent re-elaboration of Tycho von Wilamowitz's views of Sophocles to account for Aeschylus' 'inconsistencies' in dramaturgy and characterization. 79 Garton (1972b) 397. 80 Gill (1986) 271. See also Gill (1990c) and (1984). 81 Gill (1986) 271.</page><page sequence="32">22 HIDDEN PATHS grounds (he suggests) it is possible to link the analysis of character with the play's 'nexus of language, gesture and imagery'.82 With Gill's distinction in mind, we can add that in recent years much debate has centred on two desiderata. First, there is the need to save 'human intelligibility' and psychologism: 'it is hard to escape the belief that the poet [Aeschylus] was profoundly interested in a basic human predicament which is ultimately an experience of the individual'.83 In Gould's helpful formulation, this 'human intelligibility', is translated into the 'total image of human existence that the play presents... [it is] a metaphor of the way things are, within human experience, not a literal enactment of "the way people behave'".84 Secondly, there is the need to acknowledge the specificity of fictional characterization. Character in drama has been profitably defined as a construction which offers a different 'concentration' from any actual person.85 As has often been said, fictional figures can seem more real , paradoxically, than actual people, who always remain at least partially opaque: fictional figures are, so to speak, entirely available to the onlooker or reader.86 The search for the fictional specificity of character has explored the interaction or 'complicity' it has with the discourse of the whole play it belongs to, and with the tradition behind it.87 My own position is composite. Accordingly, I shall consider the issues debated by students of Geistesgeschichte as reference-points to define the 'human intelligibility' behind the tragic characters, their bearing on what 'actual people' might be. Equally, I shall try to overcome the disregard for the artistic nature of dramatic character which is sometimes present in that approach by concentrating on the language and the literary background of the text considered. As Dale points out, 'the Greek dramatic ethos was conditioned by many factors which removed it from the level of a simplistic mimetic psychology: formal rules, the mythological background, a different, "less-ambitious" ideal of hypokrisis , and a different practice of the dramatists in the relation of a dramatic speech to a conception of dramatic character'.88 In particular, I shall seek to transcend the mind/world opposition. It makes no sense to analyse a culture's concept of self as separated from its view of the world as a whole (in particular for the Greeks, who conceived themselves so much in dialogue with their 82 Gill (1986) 272. 83 Easterling (1973) 17. There is indeed a very fine line dividing any such legitimate search for intelligibility from the mistake of *bestow[ing] upon [a character] a psychological verisimilitude and depth in conformity with "our own" mental habits', as Vidal-Naquet puts it (1988a, 277). 84 Gould (1987a) 62. 8S Easterling (1990) 88-89. See Garton (1972a) 15: 'the attributes of a persona differ from those of a person in that the sum of them is totally accessible... our acquaintance with a person is always less than complete; ... our acquaintance with the personae consists of what the play discloses: this and the theoretically possible knowledge of them are coterminous'. Cf. also Wilson (1979) 728-29; Easterling (1990) 89. 87 See Goldhill (1990). 88 Dale (1969) 277.</page><page sequence="33">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 23 environment89), and when analysing characters, we must consider them as in a balance with the world they are inserted into - which means, in a balance with the worldview expressed by the text. This is expressed in a character's relationship with action, and with other characters, and also with such elements as supernatural forces. The relationships with the gods, the idea of destiny, the role of the community and the role of the family are elements complementary to character. I shall try to illustrate this balance between individual and world through a number of literary examples. In some texts the presentation of the 'world' is of a stronger kind. The influence of the gods, the faith in a supernatural ôlktj, 'justice', the respect for a social order firmly determined, create a context (as in Homer's ¡liad, or in Aeschylus' plays) in which the self-inwardness of characters seems less apparent than in texts where the trust in a stable point of reference outside man is undermined; this last is the case with Euripides especially, but also with some Sophoclean plays. The stronger the system of beliefs held about the world, the more objectified and extroverted the representation of character will be. The proportions of this balance are indeed a function of mentality (in Aeschylus, we shall argue, the view of the world - gods, family, political context, nature - is stronger and more systematic than in, say, Euripides) and of the nature of the single work (for example Medea as against Bacchae , as we shall see).90 We shall aim to show that there are two components that work to make a human portrayal in a fiction - two aspects of identity, so to speak. One I will call psychological depth , and the other sense of individuality. Psychological depth implies a profound attention to human motivation, to the deepest mechanisms of decision-making, to the emotional sphere and relationships with others; this is precisely what we encounter in tragic characterization; it is also an element that shows a particular development within the work of Euripides. Psychological depth implies a set of further motivations behind one's choices, and a more articulated totality of reasons, rooted in the person's past, in his relationships, in his life - in the most complete sense of that word. Sense of individuality, on the other hand, is what we feel as generally lacking in the Greek dramatic personae. It implies a more superficial and itemized attention to the concrete and the private particulars which shape one's individual, daily life; it privileges the single person as unrepeatable and unique, focusing on prosaic details of daily life, and on precise and idiosyncratic feelings.91 We must add that this second aspect will also find an important place in Euripides' treatment of character, alongside a tendency to deviate from the expected typology.92 Ancient criticism was much less concerned with the analysis of dramatic character as a separate issue. Aristotle's attitude to character is, at first sight, strikingly disrespectful: in Poetics VI (1450a 15ff.) we are told that tragedy, as being a 'mimesis not of persons, but of action and life', has as its goals 'events and plot', not characters, without which tragedy 89 See above, pp. 11-12. 90 See Chapter II, pp. 67-69. 91 In the modern novel these two aspects of identity in literature are mostly superimposable - a character in, say, Thomas Mann or Henry James is both rich in idiosyncrasy and psychologically deep (likewise, in Shakespeare). 92 As in Bacchae , for instance, where Tiresias is not the venerable soothsayer of the tradition, and Pentheus has some traits of the bad-tempered tyrant, but also idiosyncratic characteristics.</page><page sequence="34">24 HIDDEN PATHS would at least be feasible: action, by contrast, is the indispensable element in it. This Aristotelian claim, apart from being a statement of the necessary integration between character and action, can be read indeed as a 'limit on Aristotle's expectations' about characterization,93 but also raises the problem of whether his 'ethical' concept of character, strictly bound to tragic action and plot, is an essentially technical consideration which concerns theatrical realities only, or reflects a deeper view of man and self- consciousness, and, as a consequence, should not be overinterpreted as regards tragedy in particular. Only by relating poetics to ethics can we make sense of Aristotle's apparent disregard for tragic character and the striking difference between his representation of it and ours, accustomed as we are, in some degree or other, to an idiosyncratic portrayal of personality, endowed with certain inclusive qualities.94 Here, at least, 'Aristotle's expectation' needs to be interpreted in its ethical, as well as its technical aspects, since it seems to reflect a concern with the emotional reaction the characters provoke in the audience - the whole katharsis theory is pivoted upon this concern - rather than the emotions the characters themselves are supposed to feel. Aristotle seems to conceive 'dramaturgy essentially in terms of the relationship between poet and audience, rather than in terms of the imaginative creation of characters and their emotions',95 imagining 'the playwright himself, like an orator, standing before the audience'.96 Although Aristotle's concern with personality seems to involve audience reaction, the philosopher certainly tends to ignore the public character of Greek theatre, which combines a political, a social, and a religious event in the same experience.97 The fact that 'protected by their very fleti veness... [the stage figures] can cause the spectators to confront the complexities of emotional experiences',98 though true for drama in general, seems to be especially significant for Greek drama and the 'public' themes and 'emotional experiences' it stages. It is not a coincidence that the inner elaboration of characters and the attention called to their personal psychological life is especially developed in Euripides, in parallel with an increasing interest in familiar, intimate themes and private human values. The pursuit of public approval and the focus on extrapersonal virtues such as fame, political engagement, and social esteem is one of the most distinctive features of Greek culture, and, far from being a simple matter of 'shame', involves a multiple focus on the public acknowledgement of human value, on action as the privileged locus where human excellence or mediocrity expresses itself, on a 'reference to wider, ethical categories and standards'.99 The depiction of Greek characters in tragedy seems to be much more implicated in the general Greek worldview and the wider nature of the Greek tragic experience than our expectations of idiosyncratic, individual, 'self-exploring' personality 93 Halli well (1986) 164; 162 on 'integrated character'. 94 Jones (1962) 164. 95 Gill (1984) 155. 96 Gill (1984) 152. 97 See Hall (1996) 304 on the 'divorce of tragedy from the polis in Poetics '. 98 Easterling (1990) 90. 99 Halliwell (1990) 57. For the classic discussion of early Greece as a 'shame culture' see Dodds (1950) 1-63.</page><page sequence="35">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 25 would allow; in this connection the 'general worldview' whose public and outward aspect we are here concerned with, is that defined by Hegel as 'the heroic condition of the world'. The lack of idiosyncratic personality is explained, in Hegelian terms of conflict and conflicting rights, as implicit in the 'heroic, that is unified, characters, each of whom asserts one of the conflicting rights absolutely'.100 Hegel's conclusions about the concepts of choice, rights and guilt represent a helpful clarification about what I am calling the normativity of character, which we are here considering as a function of its 'public' aspect, even though the philosopher conceives this issue equally on an individualistic level: 'The Greek does not distinguish between the subjectivity of his self-consciousness and that which is objectively the case... [the stage figures] act from that character, that emotion, precisely because they are that character, that emotion'.101 These 'plastic characters' are incapable of contradictory behaviour and they are not subject to that 'fragmented consciousness' which is one of the chief features of modern man (including, no doubt, the modern view of man). In this perspective, the monolithic consistency of characters, which has as narrative consequence a lack of interest in daily, private idiosyncrasy and naturalistic detail, is historically framed and explained as a deep and complete identity between being and willing.102 Once the issue is posed in these terms, it might seem that the analysis of drama is now bound too automatically and consequentially to the analysis of mentality , disregarding the features of characters qua characters, within a theatrically agreed fiction. One might argue, however, that in demonstrating the extent to which the depiction of figures depends on the broader view of man off-stage, we are helping to make more overt and explicit the specific features of the genre and the distinctive features of dramatic characters. Their objective and normative depiction may be, perhaps, a corollary of the Greek outlook; nevertheless, we must look for some additional explanations for tragic 'objectivity', explanations that are specific to the tragic genre , since striking differences from the treatment of individuals in other literary genres can be noticed. A similar emphasis on the interdependence of human representations and worldvie w in the tragic genre was addressed by Parker, focusing in particular on theology. Offering a comparison with Greek oratory, Parker notes the 'transparency of tragedy... [the character's] insistence on the need for explanations', as opposed to the 'opacity' of oratory:103 a trust in the gods' benevolence, together with the lack of any deep enquiry into the divine are characteristic of oratory's propagandist agenda and optimism. As Parker notes, the question whether 'transparency or opacity is more true to life' is an unanswerable one.104 However, the important point is that the antithesis between real 'life' and literary representation cannot be resolved reductively by reference to the 'dissociative argument' that 'the worldview of a literary work is a function of genre and plot'105 100 Silk and Stern (1981) 322. 101 Hegel, Ästhetik , IV 1086 (quoted by Silk and Stern 1981, 324-25). 102 See in general Silk and Stern (1981) 312-25. 103 Parker (1997) 158. 104 Parker (1997) 159. 105 Parker (1997) 145.</page><page sequence="36">26 HIDDEN PATHS (because life and literature are in fact parallel and independent),106 nor, on the other hand, by claiming that 'the religious world of tragedy is simply that of everyday experience'.107 The representation of the gods in tragedy is indeed a 'useful device' for 'revealing a character's state of mind, or simply bringing a scene to a powerful close'; yet it makes no sense to separate it from religious views in real life.108 In summary, the three elements, literary representation, worldview and conventions or features of a genre are interconnected, as in a triangle. They sustain and influence each other, so that it is not possible to determine which element is exerting an influence, and which one is under it. If aspects of worldview obviously influence literary representation, so do the conventions of a genre. These two may, in turn, change with the development of new literary representations. Therefore, we shall highlight the concomitance of these three elements, how a certain representation of character occurs within a certain genre and as a function of certain cultural premises, rather than seeking for genetic links between them. 7.5 Representation in lyric poetry At this point it is helpful to consider the case of Ionic- Aeolic lyric poetry as a contrasting example to Attic tragedy. Greek lyric has always been considered by neo-Romantic critics,109 in opposition to epic poetry, as witnessing the 'birth of the Greek self, as a poetry which displays naturalistically the most immediate facets of the human soul,110 and whose message is available to any reader, on the assumption that 'the human heart is the same everywhere'.111 The work of the lyric poets, which largely belongs to an earlier period than extant tragedy, is a useful point of reference in our quest to define the view of self and the consideration of individuality in Greek literature. If we consider, for instance, a sample of fragments of Archilochus, Alcaeus, and Sappho (over a wide range of themes and occasions), we find a noticeable distance from the poverty of personal detail to be observed in dramatic character. This difference in favour of an earlier poetic genre shifts the question from the level of broader worldview to the narrower context of tragedy in the particular historic and social environment of fifth-century Athens. For it is clearly not the case that a permanent 'discovery of the self has taken place, in opposition to the epic, in the verses of these lyric poets. That rigid evolutionist formula offends against a plausible historical psychology and ignores the high degree of 'poetic thought within a consummate economy of means'112 that we find in lyric, despite the impression of immediacy and quasi-Romantic spontaneity we may have on a first reading. 106 Parker (1997) 146. 107 Parker (1997) 148. 108 Parker (1997) 148. 109 On whom see Burnett (1983) 1-12. 1,0 Snell (1961) 33; Snell (1953) 43-70. 111 The dismissive phrasing is that of Burnett (1983) 2. 1,2 Burnett (1983) 10.</page><page sequence="37">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 27 In search of a 'sense of individuality',113 let us first consider consistency of personal viewpoint. In lyric poetry we find the utterance of a fragmented, even contradictory state of mind, as realistic expression of human emotion. Anacreon's famous fragment 428 è pé co Te ôrjuTe koük è pé oj Kal ļiaivopai koù jiaivopai Once more I'm in love and not in love, once more insane and not insane expresses the contradictory and turbulent, insecure state of mind of the lover in the paradox 'I'm in love and not in love', stressing a complexity of feeling which is realistically human, but which would hardly find general expression in tragic emotionality. This idea of a fragmented and contradictory emotionality will show up in Euripides' representation of man, as noted above, in parallel with a new interest in private values and the more everyday aspects of human life, such as worldly concern with the relationship between husband and wife in Alcestis or Medea. By contrast, in the two earlier tragedians' work, the conflict, rather then being inside the individual, tends to be placed in the situation he or she has to cope with, to which the character reacts in an almost compulsive way, following the imperative implicit in his or her own nature or role in that situation: as a mother, as a son, as a king. Compare Sappho's portrait of the departing girl in fr. 94: the opening verses are centred on the absoluteness of the momentary feeling of grief (1-2), T60VQLKT1V 8' à8Ó'C0Ç 0éX(jO* à [i€ i1;i&lt;j8op.éva KaTeXipTravev Honestly, I wish I were dead. She was covered in tears as she went away, left me . . . which turns into a milder sadness in the following lines. A tone of wiser and quieter consolation prevails, as the poet recalls, in concrete details, the beautiful experiences shared with the beloved one ('how often you crowned your head with violets, rose, crocus, while I was beside you!', 12-13). The comprehensible wish for death is tempered by the memory of the time spent together, and the disproportion between the claim which opens the poem and the situation, in itself a commonplace one, is explained and 'solved' in terms of human emotionality. This lyric preference for sketched episodes and momentary emotions, the importance of time as actual occasion for displaying feelings or judgements, underlines another point of distance from tragedy. The fact that this 'occasional' character of lyric poetry has to be read as a conscious, artful literary device, 'much more conventional and less individual than the advocates of [personal lyric] might have wished',114 does nothing to gainsay the fundamentally different approach to human life we observe there. The temporal aspect, in fact, says much about the divergence between the two genre s. In tragedy the 'discarding of everyday life, the effect of which is to clear away "that dust of secondary considerations which so often in real life clogs the 113 As defined above, p. 23. 1,4 Burnett (1983) 2.</page><page sequence="38">28 HIDDEN PATHS movement of our strongest feelings"',115 includes a striking disregard for 'any realistic concern with time'116 in its influence on the human rhythm of life and on personal feelings.117 'Time, in this realistic, everyday sense is hardly part of the experience of dramatic characters in the Greek theatre'.118 Consider now the intimate and confidential relationship with the goddess displayed in the so called 'Hymn to Aphrodite' (fr.l, 1-7).

Rich-throned immortal Aphrodite, scheming daughter of Zeus, I pray you, with pain and sickness, Queen, crush not my heart, but come, if ever in the past you heard my voice from afar and hearkened. . . In these lines Sappho addresses Aphrodite in a confidential and intimate tone of friendship rather than with the respectful distance which usually characterizes prayers, and the list of epithets is more a matter of one-off stylization than a feature of the genre. The mention of the help given by the goddess in previous analogous situations, the so-called hypomnesia , is traditional in cletic hymns and invocations of divinities, but is here translated onto a familiar, confidential level. Aphrodite herself speaks to Sappho with the friendly, warm tone of a worried elder sister (18-20): ...TÍ, va 8T1UT£ 7T6L0Ü) ...aayr|V es oàv (fnXórara; ríç a', ai 20 ' à8í,KT|(ji; ... who is it this time I must cozen to love you, Sappho? Who's unfair to you? This expression of personal religious faith, this portrait of the goddess as ally, (aúppaxoç), the friendly feminine complicity implied in their conversation, is the furthest thing imaginable from the unfathomable mystery of the divine in tragedy. The lyric poets' attention to particulars of daily life also presents a striking contrast with the 'simplified' depictions of the tragic heroes' existence. The Sapphic verses which emphasize memory as the only consolation for the loss of a dear one are full of concrete, detailed references to the daily life and habits of the thiasos. IIS De Morgues (1967) 34. 1,6 Gould (1987a) 49. 1,7 De Morgues (1967) 40: 'time brings with it a succession of ever-changing moods, time offers moments of relaxation in the middle of the most intense experience of passion, time wears away passion and accounts for such states of mind as indifference and resignation'. 1,8 Gould (1987a) 49.</page><page sequence="39">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 29 Archilochus too foregrounds the trivial and the everyday (ff. 2): èv 8opl [lèv poi 'iaCa |i6paypéi/r|, èv Sopì 8' olvoç ' IapapiKÓç* ïïlvo) 8' èv 8opi kékXipévoç. On board ship I have kneaded barley bread, on board ship Ismarian wine, and I drink it while reclining on boardship.119 The personal, original and unorthodox stance of the poet, in contrast with the military ethic characteristic of the epic, reaffirms the privileged viewpoint of the individual as opposed to the common viewpoint (fr. 5, 1-4):120 1 aam8i pèv Zauov nç àyáXKerai , f'v Trapa Gapvco évtoç aiiGüiariTov, KáXXmov oùk èôéXojv aÙTÒv 8' è^ecrácoaa. ti poi 'ié'e i àamç €K€Ívt'; èppéTar è£a£nrç KTf|aopai ov Kaido).

I'll get one that's just as good another time. In tragedy the opposition between community and individual is an ever-present theme; but in facing the break of the pact between individual and norm, the tragic character is left with no alternative but isolation or self-destruction. Thus in Sophocles, Ajax, Antigone, and Oedipus maintain the consistency of their choice with their character at the high cost of suicide or, in Oedipus' case, blindness and exile. In short, personal idiosyncrasies as a natural, partial or temporary trait of the whole personality are banished from tragic characterization; moreover, when such peculiarities are present, the individual pursues them to their extreme consequences. A fertile field for comparison with tragedy is offered by the treatment of epic figures and mythological themes in early lyric. In tragedy, the use of traditional epic personae may be plausibly connected with the normativity of the characters. Contrast, for instance, the announcement of the wedding of Hector and Andromache in Sappho 44, which, with its richness of concrete detail, somehow covers the distance between the audience's present and the mythological events, explicitly alluding to the familiar future of the girls of the thiasos' or, again, the reference to Sisyphus' fate in Alcaeus (fr. 38), as exemplary demonstration of human hybris leading to disgrace and as warning to a friend on a convivial occasion; or the consideration, in fr. 283 and in fr. 42, of Helen's responsibility or innocence for causing the Trojan war and the death of many young Achaeans, which becomes the means of expressing both a personal judgement and an undeniable truth about human fate. The epic material is applied to a precise, present occasion or idea, 119 The meaning of èv 8opl is much disputed, and the expression is sometimes translated with 'on my spear*. Gerber (1999) 79 also proposes 'under arms*. 120 It is true that Archilochus here assumes an ethics of excellence which is not entirely remote from Homer's, and even 'an epic tradition that had neither weakened nor become burdensome' (Burnett 1983, 3), but what matters here is that the poet is interpreting it in a subjective and personal, rather than a communal way, just as Achilles does, to some extent, in the Iliad itself (see below, p. 50 on the 'Euripidean' traits of Achilles).</page><page sequence="40">30 HIDDEN PATHS which is the personal one the poet seeks to communicate to a certain audience. The distance from the epic goes beyond mere reference to everyday themes: what is evident here is the superficiality of the mythological figures, in their purely analogical use, in comparison with the vividness of tragic character, for all its simplicity and its implausible lack of personal detail. In contrasting tragic character with the lyric individual, one may profitably invoke the opposed categories of analytic and synthetic. Compared with the lyric, the depiction of tragic character is 'simplified' and 'unified', in the Hegelian sense discussed above, but displays an incomparably deeper psychological rooting and a far greater intensity. Its relation to the actual human being it wants to represent is one of synthesis. In fact, the psychological patterns in tragedy seem to bypass the intermediate set of realistic particulars that shape human life in its familiar concreteness, in a direct way that helps us to understand the Nietzschean claim that, linguistically at least, the Sophoclean heroes possess an 'Apolline definiteness and lucidity', which makes us feel as if 'we are looking straight into the innermost ground of their being, and are somewhat astonished that the road to this ground should be so short'.121 The lyric individual emerges instead as the product of an analysis , as a collection of traits that compose the human beings presented. These human beings are almost 'photographed' in their changing moods and sudden outbursts of emotion, in their idiosyncratic, eccentric, even contradictory qualities rather than in their prevailing temper. We have defined the psychological depth that we find in tragedy as including 'a set of further motivations behind one's choices, and a more articulated totality of reasons, rooted in the person's past, in his relationships, in his life - in the most complete sense of that word'.122 It is clear that we do not intend to dismiss the tragic sense of identity as a secondary feature, but to qualify it. Unlike in lyric poetry, identity plays a major role in tragedy as well, but on a normative rather than an idiosyncratic level;123 what Garton calls 'a sense of identity, a sense of the mystery and particularity of persons' is (in his words) 'a very important part of the theatrical experience as a whole'.124 Identity in this sense has been explored further by Silk who notes the tragic foregrounding of what he calls 'the name', the fact that 'the striving individual is a special someone with an identity... which must be ... realized '125 1.6 Character and the self: decision making from Homer to tragedy The differences between these types of 'identity' are crucial for the Homeric presentations of man. In Homer there is a very strong systemic frame for men's action and life: human issues are reflected or governed by the interests and involvement of the gods and, above them, of 121 Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, 9. 122 Above, p. 23. 123 Notwithstanding the convergence of tragic 'psychological depth' and attention to the individual and the idiosyncratic that takes place in Euripides. 124 Garton (1972a) 3; 7. 125 Silk (1996b) 464.</page><page sequence="41">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 3 1 Fate. The action of the single individual tends to operate only within this frame, never against it. For this reason, while we find an interest in everyday aspects and qualities of men as we did in the lyric poets, we do not find a strong attention to inwardness. A fondness for concrete detail is found throughout both epics, and it involves people as well as things: description of the preparation and consumption of meals;126 catalogue scenes such as the ship-catalogue or the teichoskopia ;,2? idiosyncratic epithets used in direct speech,128 aspects of domestic life such as the famous episodes of the bed,129 or of the dog Argos130 in the Odyssey. In short, there is a very strong taste for detail and for a rounded description of characters: not only the Iliadic Achilles or the Odyssean Odysseus, but also minor characters like Paris or Penelope offer a portrayal endowed with idiosyncratic characteristics.131 Psychological depth too is a feature of the epic: it is not something specific to tragedy. We have argued that the attention to inclusive, personal inwardness is inversely proportional to the felt presence of a stable divine - but not only divine - world as analogue to man. It develops as the continuity between man and world is broken: that is, when man develops a view of himself as lost in and antagonistic to the world rather than in communion with it. As examples of the 'felt presence of a stable world', one might compare Hector at //. XXII, 99-130 with Pelasgus in Aeschylus' Supplices. The descriptions of inner mental processes include the same elements. The subject contemplates a series of possibilities and negative or positive aspects; in Hector's case, the possibility of fleeing, and the consequent shame (ei 'iev...&gt; 'if, on the one hand...', 99-100); his responsibilities as head of the army (104); his shame in front of the whole community (aiôéopai, 'I feel shame..', 105-06); the possibility of surrendering through a diplomatic agreement with Achilles (€l Sé..., 'if, on the other hand,...', 111-20); his awareness of the fact that Achilles wants revenge, not gifts; and, finally, the impossibility of doing anything other than fight and kill or be killed (129, ßeXTepov air ' êptôi £weXa vvt^ev otti TáxiaTa, 'better to clash in battle, now, at once'). Pelasgus' situation is analogous: the king is caught between two damaging alternatives, to help the girls and cause a dangerous war against the Egyptians, or dishonour Zeus Xenios and do good for the city. The decision-making process, although presented as a deep immersion into innerness through the famous image of the diver (Ôlkt|v KoXup^rjTfjpoç, 'like a diver', at 408), is developed in a similar way as in Homer. The alternatives are juxtaposed in the king's cogitation and in the exchange of 126 E.g. II. I, 464-74; IX, 89-92; Od. VII, 172-77. 127 //. II, 484-877; III, 171-242. 128 E.g., IL III, 39, Hector insulting Paris: AúcrrTapi, dSos* ctpiorc, vwai|iavèç lYnrpoTreirrd ('appalling Paris, our prince of beauty, mad for women, you lure them all to ruin'); or, in II.

XVn, 291-327. 131 See in this respect Di Benedetto (1994) 110, on single expressions linked to a single character in the Iliad; 122, on specialized epithets; 131, on 'individual personalities inserted on a common "heroic base'" (my translation).</page><page sequence="42">32 HIDDEN PATHS lines with the chorus of suppliants (397-489). At one crucial stage in particular (472-79), the pattern is the same as in Hector's lines. The alternatives are contemplated (el 'iév/ei 8 ' 'if, on the one hand...'; 'if, on the other...', at 472 and 474) and the implications explored. A catalogue of possibilities and perceptions constitutes the decision-making process in both cases. In Aeschylus, behind the catalogue, we see the trust in the existence of a fate, a divine rule (the dues to Zeus Xenios and the solidarity owed to a family member), and an objective human justice (938-49): all these elements constitute what I have called 'the felt presence of a stable world'. We find it in the Homeric passage as well. Hector has a firm awareness of his social role, the rules of battle, the duties of a hero and, ultimately, the unchangeability of the gods' will - as he has already said to Andromache: eacjÉTai T)|iap ÖT ' av TTOT ' oXcüXtí "IXioç Ipfļ, 'the day will come when sacred Troy must die' (//. VI, 448). Decision-making scenes which follow this model have been the object of focused analysis both by practitioners of historical psychology and by critical readers of tragedy, but without the perspective I have offered, which assesses the role given to man's agency in balance with the worldview as a whole - and without this, one commonly encounters a certain discomfort with the objective and juxtapositional character of the process as I have outlined it. Snell, to begin with, stigmatizes the Homeric presentation of decisional processes as displaying a difference in outlook from Aeschylus that made it impossible for Homer to portray decision as Aeschylus could.132 Decisions in Homer are imposed from the outside by some supernatural entity. Rosenmeyer describes the decision in Homer as offering 'a criterion for the better which is little more than a signal that a choice was made',133 while, as for tragedy: 'decision-making on stage, the dramatized contemplation of alternatives and the consequent selection of one of them for enactment, is a subordinate feature in Greek drama'.134 Sharpies, interestingly, argues that the 'divided self of the Snellian analysis applies more to Plato's partition of the soul than to Homer'.135 The habit of Homeric heroes of distancing certain feelings and behaviours and attributing them to specific bodily or mental parts does not express a divided conception of the self, but rather indicates that 'the situation is a dynamic one; the boundaries of the self are not fixed, but fluctuate, even within the course of a single decision-making process'.136 An important contribution to the analysis of decision-making in tragedy was made by Knox's article on second thoughts in Greek tragedy. Knox points out that, before Euripides, changes of mind in tragedy seem to be presented in a bad light, as an 132 Snell (1964) 1. 1 33 Rosenmeyer ( 1 990) 191. 134 Rosenmeyer (1990) 194. Many scholars have also insisted on the importance of 'double-motivation' for tragedy, an inseparable coincidence of human agency and supernatural power, to explain the objectivity of tragic decision-making (see p. 9 n. 30). 135 Sharpies (1983) 5. 136 Sharpies (1983) 4.</page><page sequence="43">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 33 expression of weakness and failure.137 Knox connects this observation to his notion of 'heroic temper', a modality that is characteristic of Sophocles in particular, whereby individualism and rigid consistency of behaviour are criteria for excellence.138 However, this 'abortive modality of choices in tragedy', rather than being seen as an expression of 'heroic temper' as in Knox's reading, could also be read as a response to a world in which second thoughts have no reason to exist, a world where reality and moral truth are regarded as one unarguable thing, perhaps difficult to discover and painful to bear, but available to wise and good men. This worldview shows signs of crisis in Euripides, which is why second thoughts and decision-making as a tormented process will become a fundamental part of his representation of human beings. Gaskin's observations on this issue are particularly valuable.139 He rightly concludes that 'the progress from Homer to the tragedians does not show a development in the area of the self; in his opinion, however, a difference in treatment can be looked for in the greater complexity of the moral issues in tragedy, which make even Achilles' decisions in Homer seem much more pacific and easy than those of an Orestes or an Agamemnon in tragedy. On this reading the focus is correctly shifted from the 'view of self' to the overall 'view of the world'. In particular, Gaskin points out that Aeschylus' famous 'diver' image in Supplices (407-09) involves not a diving into the soul (there is nothing to be found there) but 'into the issue': 407 Sei toi ßaGeia? &lt;1&gt;povTi8oç atonpiou 8Í.KT1V KO'u|lßr)TT1pOS' €Ç ßu00V [IOXéÍV 8e8opKÒç oppa pr|8' äyav (¿vcopevov There is need, you see, of deep counsel to bring salvation: when the eye descends into the deep sea, it must, like that of a diver, be clearsighted and not dimmed by too much wine... In particular: 'the soul is not the right area of search because the difficulty in a moral dilemma is a difficulty in the world and not in the self'.140 Gaskin also points out that 'Homer's agents live in a world which repeatedly and generously serves them up preponderating reasons for action'.141 However, my formulation of this point would be, not that 'the soul [or self] is not the right area of search because there is nothing there', but that the belief in a stable and firm order is so great that judgement depends on and benefits from the objective reality, and does not oppose itself to it. 137 Knox (1966). Knox puts an emphasis on the opposition between Aeschylus/Sophocles and Euripides, who is taken to be the first to present change of mind as a positive mode of agency. A sensible correction to the rigidity of this dichotomy is offered by Gibert (1995) 255-62. 138 Knox (1964). 139 Gaskin (1990). 140 Gaskin (1990) 14. 141 Gaskin (1990) 15. See also Frankel (1975) 80, albeit within a Snellian conception of Homeric mind/body representations (76): 4in the Iliad... man is completely a part of his world. He does not confront an outside world with a different inner selfhood, but is interpenetrated by the whole, just as he on his part by his action and indeed by his suffering penetrates the total event'.</page><page sequence="44">34 HIDDEN PATHS In this light, the rigid opposition between Homer and tragedy, between an 'archaic' and a 'classical' outlook, is seen to be overstated. What counts is the balance between individual and world proposed by the author in the given context. We can indeed trace a historical development from Homer to tragedy, but within the specificity of each author and text. Let us consider a series of textual examples to illustrate this point. One revealing example is Phemios' deliberating process at Od. XXII, 333-39: ... Sí xa 8è &lt;ļ&gt;p€ai |i6p|if|pi£€v, fļ ckSùç pcyápoio Aios* [leyákov ttotì ßoopov 335 cpKCiou €£oito TÉTirypevov , £V0' apa noXXà AaépTris* 'OSucrcùs* t£ ßocov èm pipi ' 6KTļav, f| yoúvw XiaaoiTO TTpoaaiÇaç 'OSiKTfja. ¿86 ôé ol &lt;f&gt;pov60vTi 8oaaaaTO K6p8iov eivai* yoùvcov äipaaOai AaepTid86Cü 'OSuafjos*. ... his mind in turmoil, torn, what should he do? Steal from the hall and crouch at the altar-stone of Zeus who Guards the Court, where time and again, Odysseus and Laertes burned the long thighs of oxen? Or throw himself on the master's mercy, clasp his knees? That was the better way - or so it struck him, yes, grasp the knees of Laertes' royal son. The subject, Phemios, is uncertain (pcppripiCcv, 333) as between two possibilities. These are explicit: to look for protection at the domestic altar of Zeus, or to beg for mercy directly from Odysseus. The passage goes on to say, ' while he was thinking, it seemed better to him thus' (338). Indeed the process is formulated in such a way as to give the modern reader the impression that the final choice is something external, coming upon the subject ' while/as he was thinking' (oi &lt;1&gt;pov£ovTi, 338). No predictable explanation of the reason for this choice is given: there is a sort of simultaneity between decision and action, cause and effect, thought and reality. Consider Od. IX, 299-305, where the continuity between cogitating mind and factual reality is more evident in the verbal usage: Tov pcv éyoj ßouXcuaa kotò pcyaXrjTopa 0upòv 300 Saaov icav, £i&lt;ļ&gt;os* ò£ù èpuacràpcvos TTapà [îTpoù, OÙTdpCVai TTpÒÇ OTT10OÇ, 001 (J&gt;p£V£Ç fļTTap 6XOIKJI, Xeip' 67Tipaaaáp6vos*- 6T£poç 8é |i£ 0upòs* 6puK6v. aÙTou yap kc Kal appeç àTTOjXóp60' aiiruv SXeOpov où yáp K6V 8uvá|i€a0a 0upáoov úi/nr|Xáajv 305 xtpvw àmkracrôai Xí0ov ößpipov, 5v TTpoa£0rļK6v.

He is about to put it into practice, but (8c, 302) a different Gupóç stops him: the thought that he would not be able to remove the rock from the entrance of the cave (304-05). Gupóç here means two things: it is the seat of the subject's reflections, in line 299, and the realization from the outside, in 302. The inner and the outer aspects of the deliberation are on the same level. There is only a faint line between Odysseus' mind and the/acř that he would not be able to leave the cave once the Cyclops is dead. The same word, then, defines inner preference and external fact; the opposition, here, is not between attacking Polyphemus and waiting, as we would formulate it, but between the impulse to attack and the realization of an impediment towards it.

Unnerved himself, Odysseus probed his own great fighting heart: 'Oh dear god, what am I to have happen to me? A disgraceful thing if I should break and run, fearing their main force - but it's far worse if I'm taken all alone. Look, Zeus just drove the rest of my comrades off in panic flight. But why debate, my friend, why thrash things out? Cowards, I know, would quit the fighting now but the man who wants to make his mark in war must stand his ground and brace for all he's worth - suffer his wounds, or wound his man to death'. He was weighing it all, heart and soul ... Odysseus is left alone to battle against the Trojans, and is in doubt whether to resist or flee: ti udGco, 'what am I to have happen to me?' (404).

Other factors are added to the equation: Zeus' role in the Achaean defeat (406); the social shame of fleeing (408-10); the unpredictability of luck (410). The narrative of the hero's reflection ends with our being told that 'while he was oscillating thus in his mind and heart', the Trojans advanced and Odysseus had to fight. In this case, the choice is not even expressed: the general statement at 408-09 about good and bad warriors encapsulates the hero's decision, which could not be other than it is. Finally, in II. VIII, 167-71 Diomedes is in doubt whether to flee or stand and fight:</page><page sequence="46">36 HIDDEN PATHS TUÔ61ÔT1Ç 8è ôiávôixa [i£ppT|pi£€v, lttttouç té arpe^ai Kal evavTißiov jiax^aaaöai.

Here, the hero's doubts and deliberation are, again, on the same level as the reality outside him: Three times' (Tpíç, at 169 and 170) refers both to Diomedes' reflection and to Zeus' thundering, which confirms to the hero that the gods are not favourable and he ought to flee. The advice from the outside, his cogitation and the final choice, are continuous and contemporaneous. Commentators have stressed that in all such cases the subject's decision is an imposition from the outside (Snell) or that there is Tittle more than a signal of the fact that a choice was made' (Rosenmeyer).142 One should certainly interpret these cases as decisions taken within a context where there is no room for inward doubt and no uncertainty of a Hamletish sort, because the moral frame and the criteria for what is best are provided by the world itself and do not need to be found inside the subject. The subject simply discovers the best choice which already exists in a world firmly governed by the gods and by a solid moral code. The point was well made by a character in a novel by the Italian playwright Pirandello, The Late Mattia Pascal. The subject is the difference between ancient and modern tragedy: The tragedy of Orestes! ... Just listen to what I have just thought of. If at the climax, just when the puppet representing Orestes is about to take revenge for his father's death, on Aegisthus and the mother, what if there were a tear in the sky of the paper theatre, what would happen? ... It is easy: Orestes would be disconcerted by that hole in the sky . . . Orestes would feel inclined to revenge and would want to carry it out with maniacal passion, but, just as he was about to do it, his eyes would be drawn to the hole, from which all kinds of adverse influences would penetrate onto the stage, and his avenging arm would fall. Orestes in fact would turn into Hamlet. Believe me, the whole difference between ancient and modern tragedy consists in just that, a hole in the paper sky.143 Some tragic examples will serve to suggest how a change in the view of the world - the discovery of 'a hole in the paper sky' - does indeed influence the representation of the self. We have already noted the similarity between Pelasgos' decision-making process in 142 Snell (1953), Rosenmeyer (1990) 191. 143 Pirandello (1904) 145.</page><page sequence="47">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 37 Supplices and the Homeric model. If we look at the famous 'carpet scene' in Agamemnon 908-57, an analogous procedure is evident, irrespective of any deeper exploration of Agamemnon's motivations. The moral issue (whether it is appropriate or not for the king to walk over the purple carpet) is debated in depth between Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, but the final decision is taken in a similarly abrupt way. We have no sentence, clause or phrase in which the king offers us the moment in which he changes his mind. After a stichomythic exchange of lines with Clytemnestra, in which Agamemnon insists on the impiety of a man receiving honours owed to the gods (931-43), he simply says 'if this is what you think...', àXX ' eí 8ok£Î croi Tauô (944) and consents to walk on the purple. Arguments for and against are presented by the queen and by the king respectively; then Agamemnon puts up with it. The meaning of this action is full of implications which both parties seem tacitly to acknowledge. The moral issue is enormously more complicated than in the Homeric scenes just considered. However, no room for staged inward cogitation is left: the juxtaposition of arguments is the cogitation process. In this tragedy, as we said for Homer, there is a very strong sense of world-order. Cosmic justice and man's agency are strictly interwoven, and the family curse of the Atridae is a concrete instance of this. Orestes in Choephori lives a moment of uncertainty when he is about to kill his mother. At 899 he says to Pylades: TTuXdôri, tí ôpáoo); pTļTcp' aiScaôû KTaveîv; Pylades, what am I to do? Is such respect to stop me from killing my mother? Pylades only needs to evoke the order of Loxias and the dangers of divine enmity in reply (900-02): 900 TTOO 8dl TO XoiTTOV Ao£lOU 'iaVT€VļlCLTa TOI TTU0ÓXpT|(7Ta, Tnorá t' €l&gt;OpKGÍ)|iaTa; âiîavTaç ex^povç TÛV fìyoO TTXOOV. Then where's the future for Loxias' oracles, delivered by the Pythia, and the pledges sworn on oath? Think of all men as your enemies rather than the gods! Orestes duly replies (903): iepili ae viKdv, Kai Trapaleéis' M-Oi KaXús' I judge, you have the victory. Your advise to me is good. Here too the decision making seems to coincide with a display of arguments associated with external constraints, rather than being the product of any inner cogitation as we see it portrayed in (say) the modern novel. All Pylades' convincing advice involved was a simple mention of a fact, Apollo's prescription. We have already glanced at Aeschylus' lyric presentation of Agamemnon's dilemma at Agam. 212-17.

For it is right that one should desire the blood of the young maiden that stays the winds with rage beyond rage. So be it. Nussbaum's translation of the last three lines145 is indicative of the problem: 'For it is right and holy (0epis' 217) that / should desire with exceedingly impassioned passion the sacrifice staying the winds, the maiden's blood. May all turn out well'.146 In fact, the three last lines - clearly referable by the king to himself - are not in the Greek explicitly presented in the first person singular, as with this translation, but rather constitute a third- person statement. The first-person cogitation of the preceding line (y£V(opai...ápapTGdP;) makes way for a general statement. The personal pronoun a&lt;f&gt; ' (216), in fact, is literally a third-person pronoun, and it can be read either as referring to 'the allies, understood as £u|ipaxia' as 'alliance',147 or as an impersonal 'one should'. This procedure is func- tionally equivalent, for example, to the Homeric apologetic procedure of charging one's 0upóç - a rejected part of the self - with the responsibility for a choice, while at the same time acknowledging one's impotence against it. Agamemnon is facing the fact that it is 06|iiç, given the situation, for one to desire with full conviction the maiden's sacrifice.148 This 'objectivity' that we have registered in the Homeric and Aeschylean passages (which indeed might seem to the modern reader a rigidity in fulfilling one's fate) has to be read as characteristic of a certain vision of the place of man in the world which is part of the construction of the poem or play, rather than as an expression of a stage in the perception of the self which improperly 'ignores' its inwardness. According to this vision, in a crisis there may be only one choice. In Sophocles' Ajax we find a problematizing of the balance between the hero's view of himself and the order implicit in the divine regency of the world. Ajax feels he cannot count on the justice of Athena's prescriptions as being his justice; on the contrary, he decides to deny the role given to man by the arbitrariness of the goddess' favour or disfavour. Let us look at 646-92, the so-called 'deception-speech'. Ajax does not believe, as Orestes in Aeschylus does, in the existence of a single just choice, however painful it is to accomplish it. His will is to oppose himself to the ideas that there should be only one choice, and that the gods should be obeyed without discussion. In his words, we note the result of an inward deliberation at odds with the evidence offered by the reality of facts. First, his words hint at a plan different from their explicit superficial meaning (witness the 144 G(f&gt; at line 2 16 is Bamberger's conjecture. ,4S Nussbaunťs translation is based on the text quoted (Denniston and Page 1957). 146 Nussbaum (1986) 35 (my italics). 147 Denniston and Page (1957) 87. 148 See Lloyd-Jones (1962) 191-92 on 'Agamemnon's impossible alternative'.</page><page sequence="49">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 39 ambiguity of lines 690-92: Tor I am going where I must journey, but you must do what I tell you, and perhaps you may soon learn that, even if I am unhappy now, I have been saved'). The possibility of flexibility is contemplated, and tacitly rejected (650-53). At 666-67, the stable frame of world-order (the gods, the obedience to his overlords) is contemplated and only superficially acknowledged: Toiyàp TÒ XoiTTÒv eiaópeaôa |ièv Geoîç 6ÏK61V, 'xaQr'oó'±€oQa 8''ATpeL8aç aeßeiv. Therefore we should know in future to yield to the gods, and we shall learn to reverence the sons of Atreus. Philoctetes too problematizes the individual's relationship with the order recognized by the community of men. Neoptolemus arrives at Lemnos determined to follow Odysseus' plan. His attitude and position reveal obedience and trust in the orders of his superior (48-49; 54; 121-22). Again, as in Ajax's speech, we are dealing with a character's staged mendacity. In Agamemnon , one might say, the queen's exchange with the chorus (264-350) fakes happiness for the return of a beloved husband; but the effect is not so much to deceive - the chorus of elderly men are not a threat to her - as to project the ambiguity of her role.149 Ajax and Neoptolemus, instead, must lie for their own purposes, on which the outcome of their stories depends: a view of self more detached from reality is offered. Throughout Philoctetes we note that the son of Achilles is open to the entreaties of the wounded hero, despite or through the deceit he is operating. At 1074-75 we witness the first weakening of his resistance, and from 1222 he progressively manifests his change of mind to Odysseus. At 1270 Neoptolemus finally asks: oikow eveori Kal |i€Tayvwai náXiv; (4is there no room, then, for repentance?'). The young man's decision-making has taken 1000 lines, from 220 when he first meets Philoctetes, to 1255 when he finally communicates his decision to Odysseus. The greater inwardness and lesser straight- forwardness in decisions that we find in this play, compared with the Homeric and Aeschylean examples, are coupled with a lesser trust in the gods150 and a lesser respect for human authority, embodied in Odysseus, as well. 149 See IV. 5 below, pp. 199-200. 150 Ph. 446-52: ... ènei oùSèu ino kiikûu y' àmóXeTO àXX' eu TTepicrréAXouaiv airrà 8aipoves' Kai Trios' Ta peu rrauoûpya Kal TraXiUTpißf) xatpoua' àvaaTpé&lt;f&gt;ouTes' èÇ' AiSou, tò 8è 450 SÍKaia Kal Tà XPfiaT' àTTocrréXXoua ' àei. ttoû xpn Tiôeaôai Taîrra, ttou 8' alueiv, ÖTav tò Oei' èiîaÔpûv toùç Geous* eupio kokous*; ... for nothing evil was ever yet destroyed, but the gods well protect them and by some means take pleasure in diverting from Hades the villains and the knaves. But they always despatch the just and good there. How to account for this, from what point of view to praise it, when, praising the divine, I find the gods are evil?</page><page sequence="50">40 HIDDEN PATHS Finally, we may consider Euripides. Notoriously, in this playwright's work, a straight- forward trust in the world-order as understandable by man and implicitly just is questioned. The standard invocation to a god, ògtiç ¿cjtiv, 'whoever he is', becomes an ironic response towards the immorality of the divine world of the tradition.151 The moral judgements implicit in social assumptions and typologies also become an object of debate: the humble farmer who is Electra' s husband in Electra displays virtues of honour; women are endowed with pride and strength (Medea, Iphigenia, Alcestis, among others). War as locus of display of the highest manly virtues is a disenchanted field of destruction and suffering C Hecuba , Troades). Foreigners are often repository of wisdom and insight as deep as those of Greeks ( Hecuba , Troades, Bacchae). In many ways, therefore, the reference to a stable world, socially and religiously ordered, is contested. The depiction of self is accordingly different. The decision-making process is more articulated and deter- mined by the individual's inward cogitation. A good example is offered by Phaedra's reflections in Hippolytus. At 375-76 she says to the women of Troezen, 'at other times, during the night, I have pondered for a long time (vuktòç è v paicpû xpówp) how human life can become corrupted'. The portrayal of a person who dwells upon issues in solitary inner dialogue is sketched; a temporal development of thought is offered. From 392 to 430 she describes the development in time of her attitude towards the sick passion she has conceived: keeping it secret (393-94); trying to rationalize her mad love (398-99); killing herself (401); thinking of her status as woman (406); and thinking of her husband and children (420-21). The social obligations she quotes are, naturally, comprehensible in Aeschylean or Homeric terms as well; but in Phaedra's case they are interiorized, syntactically connected in the monologue of one self, not acted through stichomythia or presented as a list of external facts to be taken as a single option. Moreover, the queen's emotions have already proved stronger than all these good reasons. In 310-61 she is led by the nurse to confess the name of the beloved (at 351); at 215-22 and 228-31 she longs to go hunting in the wilderness where, one is made to think, she could accompany Hippolytus; at the end of the play, she will commit suicide both to protect herself from guilt, and to take revenge on Hippolytus' contempt of her. Desire, awareness of decorum's rules, love, guilt and shame are mixed in the queen's reflections. The world outside does not offer a straightforward guide to her decision. One more example, from Euripides' Bacchae. As we shall see in Chapters II and III, in this play we find the concomitance of the unreliability of the divine, the main character's isolation and a highly developed innerness. At 810-48 Dionysus convinces Pentheus to dress up as a woman and go to the mountain. The king is tempted, but afraid and ashamed at the same time. He finally consents, but adds, at 843: è'0óvT ' èç óíkovs...'...člv Sokj} ßouXeiKJO|iai,152 'going into the house... I shall decide as may seem best'.153 In this line many psychological elements can be detected: the possibility that the king has already decided, and could not wait to be asked; the idea that he does not want his antagonist to 151 Compare Ba. 769 and A. Ag. 160. 152 There is a lacuna at line 843 between olkou? and àv. Here I follow Dodds, who attributes the line to Pentheus, while Diggle attributes the first part to Dionysus; see Ferrari (1985) 51 . 153 Dodds's translation (1960, 179).</page><page sequence="51">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 41 know he has been so quick to decide; also, that he wants the stranger to remember that he is still pulling the strings; finally, his vulnerability as he likes to believe that he could always change his mind in case things go wrong. Above all, Pentheus is alone with his desires and fears to face the reality of facts, since he has no point of reference (gods, social rules or definitions, the authority of a mother or a father, a male friend). Our review of Homeric and tragic scenes shows how decision making and the representation of mental processes change with the reliance on the outside world represented and with the presence, or not, of interlocutors or partners. When isolated from their peers and disappointed, or abandoned by the gods, characters tend to resort to inner cogitation and more articulated representations of self emerge. 1.7 Character and the self: the relationship with the gods The relationship with the divine world is probably the most important element of what I have called 'world-order' as influential for the view of self - whereby, for instance, at II. VIII, 167-71 the Gupóçof the subject and the thundering of Zeus are equated in the decision-making process. Let us now analyse some passages of self-reflection in relation to the role played by divine intervention. Reflection on oneself in Homer (monologic or dialogic) seems, somehow, to have a function analogous to the god's intervention or, one might say, seems to take place only when the god's support is lacking, untrustworthy or disregarded by the subject. On the other hand, in scenes where a god's help informs events, the description of the subject is confined to a flatter third-person presentation of man. If we glance back at the decision-making passages discussed earlier, we may note that in none of them is a reference to a god's intervention present or, if present, positive and trustworthy for the subject. Accordingly, the subject has to replace reference to a dependable world-order in the person of the gods with self-dialogue. In fact, Hector in II. XXII is deceived and ultimately left alone to face his destiny; Phemius in Od. XXII deliberates in the absence of any divine contribution to his decision; Odysseus in Od. IX narrates an experience in a flash-back, and no divine inspiration is mentioned; Odysseus in II. XI is left alone to battle against his enemies; Diomedes in II. VIII is persuaded by Nestor (141-44) that Zeus has abandoned him.154 These are all situations of emergency, and negative in expectation. Most of all, they are situations in which a man is left on his own by the gods: self-reflection seems to be prompted by isolation and loneliness.155 0up.óç-speeches can be read as functionally analogous to the invocations made to a god by man. It has been argued by Pelliccia that 'speaking organs' have the function of an interlocutor;156 moreover, that they 'can be replaced by speaking parts, especially those speaking characters able to enter into a human's inner deliberation at will, the gods'.157 These interlocutors - gods, humans, organs - are equivalent in function, but indicate 154 See above, pp. 34-36. 155 This is acknowledged by Clarke (1999) 57: 'it is when [Achilles] is most aware of himself and most isolated that his begins to take on something like an existential role' (my italics). 156 Pelliccia (1995) 121-35. 157 Pelliccia (1995) 251.</page><page sequence="52">42 HIDDEN PATHS differences in the relation between the thinking subject and the outside world. When trust in the understanding of the world-order is lacking - when the gods' intervention is absent or hostile - the subject refers to some other character or to himself or herself through dialogic, dramatized reflection. Self-reflection of a purely inward, soliloquizing kind, not prompted by a reason for action, is not practised in Homer. The representation of man always depends on the world outside, as it appears at that moment to the subject. This is true even for Odysseus in the Odyssey , a character presented with more richness of moral and intellectual qualities and a more articulated background than characters in the Iliad , if only because the poem revolves around his vicissitudes - one may quote the repeated references in the poem to his relationship to his wife and to his role as a father, a son and a master of the household. In Od. V Odysseus is finally allowed by the goddess Calypso to leave her island, and has to endure a violent storm at the hand of Poseidon before Athena helps him to reach safely the shore of the Phaeacians' island. Book V is very rich in monologic reflection on the part of the hero, in all of which he is presented alone and at the mercy of the god's plans and will. There are no fewer than seven passages in the book, in which Odysseus is engaged in inner dialogue, or dialogue without interlocutor, or solitary reflection. The last five are the direct response to a situation of emergency: Odysseus laments the storm sent by Poseidon (299-312, 356-64, 408-23), beseeches the river-god to allow him to reach the shore safely (445-50) and finally, once arrived on land, he fears he may become prey of beasts if he remains on the shore (465-73). The first two scenes of self reflection, instead, are not prompted by episodic emergency, but portray the hero generally regretting his fate and longing for his family. Both passages have Odysseus described in the third person, without first-person direct speech (82-84: 'he sat weeping on the shore, as his wont had been, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears', and likewise 151-58). In both passages Odysseus' thoughts are summarized and presented in general terms, without the richness of detail and personal information of the other monologic passages from the same book. Inner dialogue is only developed when it is urged by an external threat or constraint, not as expression of a durable condition of loss or unhappiness. Accordingly, the resort to inner dialogue serves to reconstruct the presence of an external order with which man can identify, and which is temporarily perceived as suspended. Both divine intervention and self-reflection are prompted by - or correspond to - a vacuum left by the stability of the world-order. In Homer, invocations to gods characteristically occur in situations of crisis and grief, not on neutral occasions; and when they occur, they tend to exclude self-reflection. Human feelings, thoughts and decisions are somehow alternative to, or else continuous or complementary to, the god's interventions. Let us consider some examples from Homer. In IL Ill the two armies decide that Paris should face Menelaus in a duel. Menelaus is certainly superior in strength to his opponent, and would certainly prevail if the Trojan hero was not helped and finally brought away safely by Aphrodite (380-82). The whole episode is dominated by references to the gods, in particular to Zeus as defender of justice: apart from Menelaus' invocations, Zeus is addressed by Agamemnon in the oath before the duel, at 276-91, and then at 298-301 and 320-23 by the soldiers of the two armies, who express their hopes of a settlement.</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 43 Throughout this scene, Menelaus is left on his own by the gods and is bewildered by his opponent's invulnerability and sudden disappearance. Of the two, Menelaus is the one who invokes Zeus twice: at 351-54, begging the god for victory over the offender Paris, and at 365-68, complaining at his failure to hit the enemy. On the other hand, Paris, who is often represented as unmanly or cowardly158 and whom we might expect to be panicking after having been chosen for the duel (as he already was when he saw Menelaus approaching at 30-37, and as Hector will be in the face of Achilles in II. XXII, 136-37), is not presented as uttering a word, and remains described in the third person during the whole scene. Zeus as ruling agency is often invoked in the Iliad , mostly by the Achaeans, but this time he has decided to favour the Trojans (302). To this divine support of the Trojans there corresponds a different focus on the two characters in this scene. Much more attention is given to the subjectivity of Menelaus, who receives no assurance from any divinity (and so feels the need to call on Zeus), while Paris, whose survival is entirely due to the help of Aphrodite, is described in entirely third-person terms. In this connection Diomedes' aristeia in II. V is instructive. The opposition here is between the Achaean hero, protected by Athena from the outset (V.l-2: evQ ' au TuSeiSiļ Aiopx|8ei naXXàç ' A0f|vr| I Sake 'iévoç Kai Gápcroç..., 'then Pallas Athena granted Tydeus' son Diomedes I strength and daring...'), and several other heroes who are left alone to battle against the will of the gods. Particular cases in point are Pandarus and Aeneas (166-296) - before Pandarus is killed and Aeneas saved by his mother Aphrodite (294-96; 311-18). Throughout this passage, Diomedes is helped by Athena and maintains a firm relationship with her, relying on her support and entering into dialogue with her (115-32; 256; 260-61; 815-34). He refers also to other divinities: Ares (289), Zeus, Aphrodite (albeit with hostility, 348-49), and Ares again, when he recognizes that the god is now helping the enemy (604-06). The difference between Diomedes' appeals to the gods and those of Menelaus is the reciprocal character of the former as opposed to the helplessness of the latter: in Menelaus' case the invocation to Zeus remains unheard, and is almost a dialogue with himself. Like Paris in the third book, Diomedes is here described in more objective, third- person terms; no room is left for decision-making or doubt in his behaviour. Even if, unlike Paris in our previous example (II. Ill, 351-82), he makes speeches, these are the expression of confidence in his success, not reflections on himself. Diomedes is acting in harmony with the supernatural realm (he also invites his companions not to fight against the gods at 604-06, after Apollo has warned him against challenging them himself). No doubt or need for decision can touch him; his actions are emphasized over his utterances. Solidarity with a divine force replaces inner dialogue or self-reflection, for Athena has given him clear knowledge of mortals and gods (127-28): àxAw au toi ott' ò&lt;f&gt;0a|ia)v čXov, f) iTpiu ènfjev, ocķp' eu yivóxjKTiç f)|ièv Geo v f|8è Kai ávSpa. Look, I've lifted the mist from off your eyes that's blurred them up to now - so you can tell a god from man on sight. 158 E.g. at //. III, 39-57; VI, 321-53; 523-25.</page><page sequence="54">44 HIDDEN PATHS This situation is reversed for Aeneas and Pandarus, who are helpless against the violence of the Achaean hero. Their dialogue, more than their actions, is foregrounded. They are in doubt as to whether Diomedes is a god or not (177-78), since all their attempts to defeat him are in vain, given that no divine force is helping them to combat Athena. First-person utterance then comes into play. At 197-216 Pandarus presents his reasons for regretting coming to Troy without horses and war-cart, while recalling his father Lycaon and his faraway homeland, to which he longs to return. Aeneas replies with a plan of attack, at 218-28; Pandarus replies again with a counter-proposal at 230-38. The dialogue between the two Trojans, which combines planning with first-person reflection on their individual past, is a functional equivalent of the Gupóç-speeches we have analysed in the previous section. If, say, Pandarus were represented here on his own, we can imagine the same arguments and facts being debated by the hero in his own Gupóç or c(&gt;pf|v' Once again, then, first-person reflections and Gupóç-speeches appear mainly as alternative to positive advice or concrete help from the gods. At 311-13 a divinity, Aphrodite, comes into play to help Aeneas as well. In the ensuing lines, accordingly, the presentation of Aeneas changes. While previously he was making plans with someone else, now he is described in third-person terms and no longer engages in self-reflection or decision-making. No Homeric character is ever presented commenting in direct speech on his individual feelings while a god is overtly helping him, and neither is Aeneas here. In the following lines Diomedes, blinded by fury, dares to wound Aphrodite (334-42) and then again attacks Aeneas, now protected by Apollo, who finally warns him not to go too far (436-42). Here Aeneas is still silent: his behaviour is presented as Automatic', driven by divine intervention. At 461, Ares decides to encourage the bewildered Trojan warriors. To do so, he does not address them as a god - something he could well do, with more encouraging effect - but takes the form of a mortal, Acamas, chief of the Thracians. The human warriors do not, therefore, recognize the presence of a helping god. A scene of debate and dialogic self-reflection follows, analogous to the Pandarus-Aeneas dialogue we have looked at. Sarpedon reproaches Hector (471), also recalling his faraway homeland, Lycia, and his personal history, the family he has left to come to Troy (478-84). 159 Hector is said to be 'bitten in his heart by these words' (493, 8ÓK6 8è cf&gt;p6vaç"EKTopi pùGoç). Yet unlike his companions, Aeneas is still silent when Ares makes him reappear (512-18), and the other Trojans 'asked him nothing', as they are hindered by the new crisis that Apollo, Ares and Strife have set in motion (516-18). Aeneas himself, the only Trojan hero who is aware of the gods' help - he has just come from the sanctuary of the god (512) - is presented in strictly third-person terms (514-18): ALmaç 8' ¿Tapotai iieGioTaTo* toí 8' exaprjaav, 515 cbç éÎ8ov £cúóv t6 Kai àpTepia TrpoaióvTa Kai 1ié voç èaGXòv ëx0VTa* |i6TáXXricráv ye [lèv ou ti- où yàp 6a ttovos* aXXoç, bv ' ApyupÓToÇoç eyeipev "Apri?

And how they thrilled to see him still alive, safe, unharmed and marching back to their lines, his soul ablaze for war, but his men asked him nothing. The labour of battle would not let them, more labour urged by the god of the silver bow and man-destroying Ares and Strife flaring on, headlong on. In tragedy the model of decisive divine intervention is abandoned, and the decision or response of the individual is foregrounded and problematized. This happens to a greater and greater extent from Aeschylus to Euripides: in broad terms, we can claim that divine presence becomes less intelligible and convincing in the latter. Conversely, a first-person viewpoint becomes central as trust in the outside world appears more frail and questionable. A development in this sense can be easily drawn through a few examples from the work of the three tragedians. From Aeschylus to Euripides, what will find a greater and greater articulation in tragedy is the situation-model, which we have now analysed in some Homeric passages, where a man is abandoned by the gods, cannot understand the supernatural plan, or chooses not to identify with it. This, from a narrative point of view, corresponds to a greater space given to first-person instances and deliberating dialogue between characters. In Prometheus Vinctus a firm belief in the systematic nature of the world governed by the laws of justice is maintained, along with a presentation close to our Homeric 'third- person' examples.160 The main character, Prometheus himself, is a good example of character in harmony with the world-order. He is himself a Titan, and is the repository of a knowledge of the cosmic system superior even to that of Zeus and a deep conviction in the eventual right outcome of his painful fate. Moreover, all the other characters of the play, except Io, are divine forces. At 88-92 Prometheus invokes elements of the cosmos as witnesses to the offence he has received: eo 8íoç ai0fip Kal Taxt/nrepoi TTVoai, TTOTafiojv TÉ Trriyai TTOVTLCOV TÉ KupaTwv 90 àvT|pi0pov yeXacj|ia TTaļiļifļTop té yfj, Kal tòv TravÓTT*nr)v kúkXov fļXLou KaXû, ÏÔÉO0É |i' ola TTpòç 0ÉÛv TTáaxoü Qeòç. O bright air and feather-swift breezes, streams of rivers and countless smiles on the billowing sea, Earth mother of all and all-seeing, circling Sun, I call on you: look on me, a god, how the gods make me suffer. Prometheus appeals to the Sky, the Breezes, the Rivers, the Earth and the Sun as witnesses to Zeus' cruelty and unfairness towards him. What he repeatedly invites them to see (cf. 160 For the purposes of this discussion, PV is treated as Aeschylean. In the relevant respects, it is certainly very far from the Euripidean mode (see Griffith 1977, Pattoni 1987, 7-33 and Podlecki 2005, 195-200 for the status quaestionis on PV s authenticity).</page><page sequence="56">46 HIDDEN PATHS 92 lôéctOé; see also 93, 8épx0r|0 ',119 ópčtTÉ,141 06px0TļT ' , and éaiôeaO ' ) is on a level of reality that he entirely shares with them.161 He knows in advance what will happen (e.g. 101-03,...

The position of Prometheus in the play is analogous to that of The winners' in Iliad, characters who recognize themselves in the world-order which is helping them at that moment (Diomedes at the beginning of book V; Achilles in book XXII). Likewise, Prometheus' mental processes are completely objectified and externalized. This happens despite the fact that in the Aeschylean tragedy a wide development is accorded to the titan's first-person viewpoint through his long monologues, whereas this development is inhibited in the instances of epic figures like Diomedes and Achilles (in line with the differences between the two genre s). In Prometheus' words we do not see the trace of open planning and decision, or regret for his own choice of intransigence. He acts and speaks by the compulsion of his own nature, and with a precise awareness of the future. His suffering and his future redemption are presented and accepted at the same time as part of an 'unchangeable destiny' (tt)v TT€TTpüjpévr|v...| aîcrav, 103-04). The fixed Fate, to which Zeus himself is subject, is not opposed to the character's intellect or skills (Téxvq); it is acknowledged as stronger than man's control, but placed on the same level: téx^t) 8 ' avayKri? àoQeveorépa ļiaicpcp, 'skill has far less strength than necessity' (514). We might compare this thought with Od. XVIII, 136-37, where the same common ontological location of fate and individual, fundamental in Homeric outlook, is apparent: toîoç yàp voos* eoriv emx0ovicov avflpcomov, olov €TT ' fjfiap ayi^ai 7TaTf]p àv8pûv re 06tov té. The mood and mind of the mortals, as they pass across the earth are such as the days that the father of gods and men makes dawn. Three elements are here put on the same level: human mind or plans (vóoç), human life or condition (fj|iap, literally 'day'), and Zeus' decision. In PV, no question about justice is left open: Prometheus' convictions make him coherent with a strong view of the world. The fact that the authority of Zeus is challenged 161 The reference to natural elements as witnesses is an important cultural lever. Contrast the insistence on the loss of such reference in post-Romantic literature: Büchner ( Woyzeck , 41-42): 'once there was a child with no mother and father. Everything was dead and there wasn't a soul left on Earth... the child went out and searched day and night. But since there was no one left on Earth he wanted to go up to Heaven, and indeed the Moon looked down kindly at him, but when he got up to the Moon it was just a piece of rotten wood. So he set off for the Sun, and when it got there it was only a withered sunflower, and when he got to the stars they were only golden gnats that a shrike had stuck to a blackthorn bush, and when the child wanted to go back down to earth, it was just an upside down chamber pot and the child was all alone...'. Likewise, see the version of the 'appeal to the elements of the cosmos ' in Kafka's Description of a struggle : 'What is that that makes you all behave as though you were real? Are you trying to make me believe I'm unreal, standing here absurdly on the green pavement? You, sky, surely it's a long time since you've been real, and as for you, Ringplatz, you never have been real... Thank god, moon, you are no longer moon, but perhaps it's negligent of me to go on calling you so- called moon, moon. Why do your spirits fall when I call you "forgotten paper lantern of a strange colour"?'.</page><page sequence="57">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 47 by Prometheus does not engender an opposition between him and the world-order: it is rather a sign of the superior knowledge of the Titan about that order.162 In the Choephori the figure of Orestes acts within a certainty of cosmic justice, albeit this justice is a twofold concept which constricts the subject to repair a wrongdoing, Agamemnon's murder, by committing another one, the killing of his own mother. Although at 899 the character experiences a moment of hesitation ('what am I to do?', tl 8pdaaj;), he knows that he has no choice but to obey the compromizing order of Apollo. At 984-87 he invokes Helios as future witness of the justice he has accomplished through the matricide: ... ¿9 ÍÔT1 7TQTT)p, 985 oux oupóç, àXX' ó itolvt * éttotttéíjqív Táôe "HX109, ãvayva propôs* €pya TÍ1Ç èpfjs' ù)Ç âv TTapfj poi pápTV9 6 V ÔLKT) TT0T6 . . .so that the father may behold - not my father, but he who looks upon this whole world, the Sun! - may behold my mother's unholy work, so that he may bear me witness on the day of judgement, when it comes . . . If we compare the Aeschylean character to Euripides' presentation of him in Orestes , the objectivity and openness of the first is immediately apparent. We do not find, in Aeschylus, anything like the doubt and regret which torments the Euripidean anti-hero. Facing the disastrous consequence of his success in killing his mother, he thinks of himself as diqXa pikt)? Tfjaô ' €xoov piáapaTa, 'bearing as I do the unenviable pollution of this victory' (1017). These words do not express regret for the action committed; they rather offer an awareness of the unavoidable consequence of the accomplishment of justice by his hand, a justice subject and organic to the curse of his whole family. The source of pain for man is not in man himself, but in the world he has to live in. Pollution and the final appearance of the Erinyes, at 1048-50, constitute the whole of Orestes' externalized guilt, which is far from the deep aúveaiç which haunts his counterpart in the Euripidean play (396). Aeschylus' chorus do refer to the Erinyes as 8o£ai at their appearance (1051), but not in the sense of visions deprived of reality as in Electra's consolation to her brother in Orestes (ópct9 yàp oùSèv cop SokéÎç aá&lt;f&gt;' dSévai, 'you are not seeing any of the things you think you are sure of, at 259). The Aeschylean chorus, by contrast, explain the Erinyes with the comment mrraiPiop yap alpá aoi xeP°^ ^ti, 'that is because the blood is still fresh on your hands' (1055): the opposition is not, as in Euripides, between inwardness and externalization, between the product of one's mind and a real fact, but rather between Orestes' perception of the goddesses as an extraneous hostile entity and the chorus' assertion that these entities are at the same time the man's deed itself. In Eumênides , the same pattern of objectification continues: the goddesses constitute the chorus, and Apollo and Athena are actors in the debate which will absolve Orestes from his guilt, by the workings of the Athenian Areopagus. Orestes' mental state is the 162 Moreover, as widely argued, the contrast seems likely to have been dissolved in a final alliance with the Olympian god at the end of the trilogy: Prometheus' character remains in solidarity with the cosmic order.</page><page sequence="58">48 HIDDEN PATHS direct outcome of the facts: his wandering, his rites of purification, his final absolution. Once external guilt - in the shape of the Erinyes - is made inoffensive, there is no doubt or suffering left for the murderer, who simply disappears from the stage. The debate over his action is turned into a debate between divine forces, eventually resolved in terms of honour and acknowledgement of the Erinyes' role by Athena. In Aeschylus' Prometheus Vinctus and Oresteia , then, a firm worldview precludes any development of inward processes - doubt, decision-making, and personal feelings - as separated from the outcome of events. In Sophocles this compact texture of the world becomes looser than in Aeschylus. In Ajax , OT and OC, for instance, we confront an unresolved flaw in the relation between man and the cosmic order. In Ajax the hero prefers to oppose the world-order at the price of his own life, dying in order not to be subject to the arbitrariness of divine will, personified by Athena. In Oedipus' story, the nobility and grandeur of a man is coupled with his destruction and downfall. The solution to this absurdity has two faces, one human and one supernatural. The supernatural face is a mystery beyond knowledge, the summons by the god to Oedipus in Colonus and the privileged secrets revealed to Theseus. The human face is made clear by Oedipus himself, at OC 1617-18, and is no less enigmatic: the one word which 'cancels all this toil', his love for his daughters: tò yàp ouk černý ötou ttXéov I fj TOUÔ6 Tàvôpòç eaxe0 '..., 'such love I as you ha ve had from me, from no man else I have you received ...'. In these three examples, characters are developed in a psychologically deeper way proportionate to their distance from the support of the world-order. In OT Oedipus has committed his damning crime through unawareness as well as through personal mistakes; he does not act, like Orestes in Aeschylus, out of an inescapable choice imposed by the order of things and prompted by someone else's actions. Oedipus knows he cannot escape the consequences of what he has done, but maintains a temper and a dignity within and against the submission to his fate. The continuity of the hero and his fate is apparent, but the hero's motivation and response are more articulated than the acceptance of his duty for Orestes, for whom the resolution of the externalized problem - the pacification of the Erinyes - finally entails the end of any involvement for the man. Finally and notoriously, in Euripides the divine world of tradition is discussed and discredited.163 Inter alia , the traditional topos of divine paternity or maternity, whereby 'divine' (Sioç) or 'godlike' (laó06oç) come to seem natural epithets for so many Homeric 163 E.g., see Bellerophontes , fir. 2, 1-3, &lt;f&gt;r|aív Tiç eivai ôíyr' ev ovpauiò Oeoúç; oùk elcjLv, oÙK da', d tlç àrôptûmov 0éXei rif| tû TTaXaiû liûpoç ûv Xóya).

In Ion , Creusa' s reflections on the state of a woman deprived of children {e.g. 252-54, 398-400), her shame at the rape (288, 336), her disappointment with her husband (863-66), are subjects in their own right; any faith in the justice of the gods, meanwhile, is undermined by the cowardice of Apollo from the beginning of the play, where Ion admits that q8lk€L vvv ò Geóç, The god has done wrong' (355). In this play the subject's reflections and his attempts to understand the world replace the presentation of the world as self-evidently right. In Hippolytus , likewise, Aphrodite's action is prompted by low instincts of revenge, and directed towards a completely innocent person. What is foregrounded is Phaedra's painful love for her step-child, and the uselessness of Hippolytus' rigid pietas , not the supernatural mechanism behind it, which is deprived of any understandable coherence. In many plays the intervention of the gods is absent or reduced to a purely functional, even absurd agency, which mechanically resolves the plot, while the focus is on the characters' actions and psychology.164 The representation of inward process has replaced the representation of the world-order as a stable religious frame. 1.8 Character and the self: individual and community Our last instance of world-reference is the community in which man lives in a shared order, which permits communication, mutual intelligibility and straightforwardness of social intercourse. Such order takes different shapes. Relationships within a community include aspects such as the political system, the social hierarchy, the 'national identity', and familial relationships, all of which may facilitate, or obstruct, interest in the individual's inner processes considered as secluded from the outside world. The analysis of this last point is articulated along the lines of three parameters for representing individual and community in Greek literature up to tragedy: structure respected, involuntary or voluntary opposition of the individual to the outside world, and connatural extraneity of an individual to a community. In literary representation, integration of the individual within a strongly defined social context determines a more objective and externalized representation of his or her inner life, for two reasons: first, because it grants characters a shared 'language' to communicate with - no gap is emphasized between what one says and what one is - and secondly because it privileges a particular interpretation of 'the facts'. In such a context, only a limited space is left for eccentric individualism - as, for instance, the individualism of the Iliad is mostly fulfilled through respect for a set of values, not against or outside it. In Homer, significantly, the narrative function of this 'set of values' is analogous to the function of divine interventions.165 In the Iliad , self-reflectiveness is most apparent wherever these values are least in evidence. The episodes which display a deeper 164 Here Nietzsche's notorious critique ( Birth of Tragedy 12) retains its force. 165 Hammer (2002) underlines this connection, pointing out that in Homer 'agency and chance [the god's influence] ... serve to define each other as they are mediated through culture' (58). Hammer emphasizes that the Homeric heroes' characteristic response to divine intervention is an attempt to re-establish hierarchical order and thereby restore balance in the community (47-49); in this way, the gods' influence is integrated onto the level of human action, rather than opposed to it, and has political relevance within the human context.</page><page sequence="60">50 HIDDEN PATHS representation of individual feelings are located outside the ethical centre of the poem, namely the aristocratic values of military excellence and social shame. Thus it is, above all, with Hector's colloquium with Andromache in //. VI, 399-493. The episode both presupposes but is also set apart from the military realities: the destiny of Troy and the moira of Hector are only the background for personal reflections on the destruction of Andromache's family (414-28) and the future that awaits a widow (432; 454-63). In such episodes, however, the individual is not yet estranged from his context: for Hector and for Andromache, mental life is expressed in shared debate and non-ambiguous commun- ication. The Iliadic Achilles, however, is different. With Achilles and his anger, individual characteristics are developed in the suspension of social norms, as if in excess of the prevailing ideology of the poem as a whole.166 The confrontation between Agamemnon and Achilles in book I has often been interpreted as the expression of an intransigent 'ethic of shame'; it is, rather, a breaking of the rule of rewards on the part of Agamemnon against Achilles' just expectations. The main psychological characterization in the poem is prompted by an evasion of a social rule. The whole characterization of Achilles, it might be said, is located on a different ground from the other characters, and has a different focus from them, just because of his estrangement from the rules. His decision not to participate in the war should be understood in this light, and in particular his individualist opposition to the political establishment: note, above all, his insults to Agamemnon (6r|poß0po9 ßaCTiXeu?, 'king who devours his people') at I, 231, or in the embassy episode in IX, 185-668. Here, at IX, 307-426, Achilles explains his reasons for refusing to fight. His long speech includes a wide range of references to his personal life, to his family, to a possible future in his homeland. He does not acknowledge Agamemnon's authority (318-45) and he refuses the offer to marry one of Agamemnon's daughters (391-92, ö 8 ' ' Axaiûv aXXov eXeaGcu, I os Tis ot T ' 6TT60LK6 Kal oç ßaaiXeirrepos' èoTiv, 'let him pitch on some other Argive - one who can please him, a greater king than I'). And the outcome is a new sense of inwardness, represented in a whole range of striking behaviour and linguistic detail, from his unique usage of the verb peppqpLCeiv ('to ponder') with qToop ('heart') as subject (//. I, 188-89), 167 to the 'extra-dramatic', 'Euripidean' expansiveness of book IX itself. In the 'embassy to Achilles', the hero does not fundamentally change his mind, and the protracted colloquium is completely vain; its 'main effect' is to 'leave us with an insight into Achilles' soul'.168 The general background in Homer, however, against which Achilles' character is foregrounded, is one of 'structure respected'. Throughout the poem, the superiority of the aristoi as well as the necessity of obeying the powers-that-be is often explicit, as in Nestor's words to Achilles at I, 277-79:169 166 Cf. Di Benedetto (1994) 319-28, 'Al di là dell'ideologia aristocratica'. 167 Di Benedetto (1994) 107. 168 Stahl (1977) 175. Hammer (2002) 93-113 also considers Achilles' 'liminal' position, in political terms (96); the hero will go from a position of 'suffering-from' interaction with others to 'suffering-with' others, best illustrated by contrasting Achilles' conflict with Agamemnon in the first book (Ch. 7). 160 See Di Benedetto (1994) 349-58, 'Il poeta davanti al principio di autorità'.</page><page sequence="61">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 5 1 277 JJT1T6 au, TTqXeí&amp;ri, éôéX' èpi£é|ieuai ßaaiXfj'i avTißir|v, èireì ou tto0' opoir^ eppope Tipfjç aKTìTTTOUxo? ßaaiXeu?, Ji re Zevç kuôoç eôojKev. And you, Achilles, never hope to fight it out with your king, pitting force against his force: no one can match the honours dealt a king, you know, a sceptered king to whom great Zeus gives glory. Perhaps the most famous instance of 'structure respected' is the episode of Thersites in II, 21 1-69: the soldier who likes to insult his betters to make his peers laugh, and has all the features of the popular demagogue, is stigmatized as the ugliest and most hateful of all the men who came to Troy, and is shamefully punished by Odysseus in the presence of all. It is precisely the episodes or figures associated with a 'suspension of the norm' in the epics that provide a model for tragic creativity and, not least, for the psychological analysis within it, which is increasingly apparent from Aeschylus to Euripides. Like the faith in the just regency of the world by the gods, the belief in the justice of the political order is very strong in Aeschylus. In Persae , Supplices and Eumênides , the reference to political power as the locus of justice is apparent. The expression of an idiosyncratic view-point is confined mainly to figures estranged from the dominant socio-political norms of the plays: the daughters of Danaus, the defeated enemy's queen in Persae. In Seven against Thebes , strikingly, a more questioning approach is articulated in the myth of fratricidal war, with the presentation of Amphiaraus in the teichoskopia at the centre of the play (375-652). This passage has been the object of much analysis, in particular in the light of semiotics:170 the symbols on the shields are a 'code' of the scene proper, that Eteocles is interpreting (at 519 he claims to be speaking irpoç Xóyov tou af|paTOÇ, 'interpreting signs'). In the presentation of the seven warriors Amphiaraus is singled out as the only one to question the belief in the justice of their mission, and he is also the only one not to have a symbol on his shield, while all the other warriors do.171 Readers have usually emphasized the opposition between the wisdom and restraint of the seer and the furious aggressiveness of the other heroes.172 What is interesting to underline here is that the character who presents a personal, discordant view is also excluded from the common symbolism shared by the others (591-92): 170 E.g. Zeitlin (1982). See also Vidal-Naquet (1988a) 291: with Amphiaraus' blank shield 'the whole collection of the rest of the shields is immediately shifted from the plane of being to that of seeming and the realm of ambiguous signs'. 171 On 'heraldry as map of the world', in whose arithmetic Amphiaraus cannot fit, see leranò (1997, xvii-xviii). Many have commented on Amphiaraus' singularity in the teichoskopia : see, e.g., Bacon (1964) 27-29: 'Amphiaraus . . . has no device on the shield. He alone has no mask. Because he can distinguish illusion from reality he is master of himself . . . Amphiaraus shows his aloofness from the war and his difference from the other champions, by having no shield device. And, equally important, he speaks in the tones of ordinary conversation (ßd£o), Xéyo), aùôdo), all verbs of speaking and talking, as compared with ßpepxü, ßoda), dirréto, ¿TraXaXd£ü), verbs of roaring and screaming), and has no noise making accoutrements'. See also Cameron (1970) 106: 'Amphiaraus' shield is blank. There is no omen there to be interpreted', and Thalmann (1978) 116-17: 'with no shield device to interpret and no boast to turn against Amphiaraus, Eteocles can reply only by recognizing the seer's moral worth'. 172 See Moreau (1976) 160, Maltomini (1976) 77, Albini (1976) 15, Thalmann (1978) 1 16, Hecht (1974) 77-78.</page><page sequence="62">52 HIDDEN PATHS ...crrjļia 8' OÜK €TTT'V kúkXco* où yàp 8ok6Îv apiaTos1 àXX' eivai ôéXei There is no sign on his shield, because he does not wish to seem best, but in fact to be the best. Amphiaraus is the hero who 'does not wish to seem, but in fact to be the besť (592): the existence of a deeper level of character (etvai, 'to be' as opposed to SokéÎv, 'to appear') is explicitly connected with the lack of a sign, a crfjpa to be straightforwardly communicated to others. Amphiaraus is also the only one, in the third-person description by the messenger, whose 'eccentric' words are reported in a first-person speech (580- 89). 173 Once again, it is a centrifugal movement away from a dominant feeling, the bellicose excitement shared by the others warriors, that prompts the emergence of a subjective viewpoint. In Sophocles and Euripides, reference to norms becomes, notoriously, less black and white. In particular, Sophoclean characters are liable to oppose themselves to a system of values or courses of action shared by the other characters, as with Antigone, Ajax, Philoctetes and Neoptolemus. In Euripides' work, opposition to received values becomes determinative, and the marginalized categories of society - foreigners, slaves, women - 1 ... 174 1 become protagonists ... in action. 1.9 Features of tragedy We have reached the following provisional conclusions. First, the view of self cannot be reconstructed without reference to the view of other aspects of human life in the given culture; in Greek literature, in particular, the two are not opposed, but continuous. Secondly, the opposition between characters offering more or less inwardness, subject- ivity and idiosyncrasy does not straightforwardly sum up Homer as against tragedy, or Aeschylus as against Euripides, but is rather a matter of degree that depends on the operative worldview, as well as on features of the genre. Idiosyncratic and everyday detail in particular is presented by Homer, as it is, to a certain degree, by Euripides. Disregard for the everyday and the idiosyncratic in tragedy, therefore, does not entirely depend on a lack of interest within the general Greek view of man. We can presume, then, that the relative lack of detail and the tendency towards broad characterization in tragedy as a whole is specifically linked to Athenian tragic-theatrical experience in the fifth century, even if these broad characteristics tend to decrease in the third of the great tragedians. The search for an explanation has therefore to turn to the specific features of tragedy itself. The more obvious attempts to account for these particular aspects of characterization on historical grounds seem to be partial and unsatisfying: notably the appeal to ritual, according to which 'tragic origins affected the spirit [of tragedy] itself, so that the poet 'would see his figures more as elements in a pattern, from a more external and fatalistic, m Amphiaraus has been seen here as a 'the author's mouthpiece' (Moreau 1976, 162). 174 Fuller discussion of Euripides will be given in Chapters II and III, pp. 59-161 .</page><page sequence="63">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 53 and therefore less individualizing viewpoint';175 likewise the suggestion that the specifics of Greek religion serve to 'dissever the personae from character as later understood'.176 Such suggestions allow us to see how this kind of representation might be immediately comprehensible and plausible to a Greek audience, even when certain aspects seem incongruous, badly-sketched or cold to us, but they ignore the fact that the approach to human representation is different from the one we have seen in pre-tragic lyric poetry, and therefore calls for a specific explanation. The same objection applies to any attempt to 'explain' tragic character in terms of its epic background. It is, no doubt, true that such a background (which many of the main tragic characters share) does not favour the development of idiosyncratic characterization. As Halliwell puts it, 'the traditional myths used and reshaped in epic and tragic poetry allow relatively little scope for a strong sense of individuality'.177 Yet it must also be seen as the result of a choice, and not necessarily a single artist's conscious choice: rather, a generic predisposition. Aristotle's emphasis on action and event over ethos, arguably, reflects this predisposition, as does his tragedy-centred view of fiction as illustration of general truth.178 The presentation of an easily recognizable myth in concentrated dramatic form tends to abstract from the single situation presented, and to prompt the audience to recognize the working of general rules. The spectator of (for instance) a more diffuse character-based modern movie is rarely allowed the same. In this spirit Rorty writes that 'the audience does a double take, as it were. It recognizes that Sophocles is presenting an old tale; and it recognizes that the old tale represents the structure of a certain sort of action'.179 What could be argued to be a limitation imposed on the possibilities of character representation becomes, in this perspective, a powerful means of abstraction, a way to present the audience with 'an exploration of life writ large'.180 Two other aspects of tragic staging - the convention of masking and the chorus - may be relevant here. Masking 'cannot be reduced to a kind of fancy-dress party or bal- masqué',181 and it would also be misleading to limit it to a sort of ritual relic. On the contrary, it exerts an active influence on the representation of stage figures,182 just as the literary (epic) tradition behind them influences their normative depiction. The mask 175 Garton (1957) 253. 176 Garton (1957) 253. 177 Halliwell (1986) 165. We should not forget that the usage of well-known, public figures belonging to the mythological tradition, let alone the presentation of well-known stories, is a characteristic of epic in the first place. This familiarity of contents clashes with the principle of suspense which is crucial in modern novelistic parameters; however, far from being a universal requirement for successful fiction-making, suspense was neither felt nor required by Greek sensibility. Greek literary production is more straightforwardly informed by a cognitivist and objectivist-mimetic notion of art. 178 See Po. IX, 1451b 5-8: 'poetry is more philosophical and more elevated than history, since poetry relates more of 'the universal' (tò kqÔóXou), while history relates 'particulars' (tq kq0 ' ëKaoToy). 179 Rorty (1992b) 5. 180 Rehm (1992) 38. 181 Gould (1987a) 49. 182 See Webster (1965), who interestingly argues for an active role of the mask in the creative process of shaping the characters and plot.</page><page sequence="64">54 HIDDEN PATHS 'implies an understanding of human intelligibility altogether different' from our everyday one; 'personality is presented in the changeless, public continuity of the mask'.183 This element also plays a role in keeping a character's disposition at its normative level: 'the non-neutral mask of Greek theatre affects the character's temper, forcing him to keep it constant. Hence, when an external event seems likely to cause feelings very different from the expected ones, the characters are committed to follow one dominant cast of mind'.184 This intensification of the main trait is a constitutive part of the function of masking, and has to be read together with the fixity of relationship between the mask and the face, irrespective of the possible distortion of the latter: the mask 'does not lose its connection with the particular human face to which it refers'.185 The normative and the prevailing, not the idiosyncratic, seem to be the chief aspects of characterization through mask,186 especially as masking tends to represent characters in terms of categories or roles, hindering questions on the appropriateness of the actors' overall look to their role, for instance, and therefore inviting the audience to concentrate elsewhere.187 The deep link between mask convention and the normative kind of identity that tragedy foregrounds has been explored by Wiles, in particular, in the light of modern performance and audience response. Wiles argues that the effect of the Greek mask is to reveal instead of concealing , a function opposite to the one we normally tend to attribute to it, since 'our culture is extraordinary in its avoidance of the mask convention, and that avoidance has philosophical roots. To conceal the face is to conceal the self - self being the goal of romantic and modernist enquiry'.188 This revealing function has many corollaries, on a practical as well as on a more conceptual level. Mask, for Wiles, plays a role in enhancing the comprehension of what the spectator hears: 'people hear better when they have a recognizable face on which to focus';189 a more stylized face, like the one offered by a mask, allows a clearer and more immediate addressing of a character's identity on the part of the audience. At the same time, this intensification of identity is not obtained through emphasis, but rather through 'neutrality, lack of expression',190 whereby mask becomes a 'vehicle' that draws the whole body into the scenic space;191 it 'creates a relationship of distance' with the audience, helping actors maintain their impersonal role 183 Gould (1987a) 49. 184 Albini (1994) 77. 183 Ogibenin (1983) 5; and also Calarne (1986). 186 It is tempting, despite complications, to compare Aristotle's requirements that the tragic sufferer be situated between the idiosyncrasies of extreme vice and extreme virtue, (6 přTa£ú, 4the person in between', Po. 1453a 7). Aristotle's requirements fordos, 'character', are of course different (Po. XV); for the philosopher, though, character should offer an example of representative human reaction to events, it should be 'a stand-in for the universal' (Frede 1992b, 209). See Halliwell (1986) 160: 'characters should not stand at an ethical extreme, but should be such that an audience can experience a sympathetic moral affinity with them'. 187 Rehm (1992) 41. 188 Wiles and Vervain (2001) 256.

Regardless of the degree of its active involvement in the staged action, it is the only constant presence on the stage, in opposition to the actors' alternating presences: 'actors come and go, but the dramatic space is never empty: it is inhabited by collectivity'.193 The continuous presence of a com- munal eye in the same space as the actors, interacting with them and at the same time standing in the actual audience's sight, renders the play's monologism194 much more fluid and questionable, blurring the border which separates staged personae and audience. The choral viewpoint, or viewpoints, characteristically occupy the middle of the clearly established gap between acted drama and onlookers (or indeed readers). At various degrees in different tragedies, the shift between participation and witnessing unmistakably marks the chorus' role. Its implicit presence, even when silent, should always be stressed in connection with the fundamentally public and communicative dimension of the actors' performance, and tends to militate against inner feelings on the part of the characters they represent. After the prologue, actors are never on their own on the dramatic stage; any discourse between them and any expression of their individual viewpoint, even in the form of a self-dialogue, is shared with this collective presence. Furthermore, the spatial position of the chorus (between audience and actors) and its elaborate and alien idiom in choral song guarantee it the function of a sort of filter or 'decompression chamber' between the acting individuals and those who might be tempted to identify with them. Like masking, the chorus can be read as a shield between the audience and the disturbing individuals onstage.195 All in all, the chorus represents perhaps the strongest objectifying presence among the various elements of Greek tragedy, and one which unquestionably tends to limit audience identification with the individuals represented by actors.196 Accordingly, the well-known attenuation in the role of the chorus in the last decades of the fifth century has a symptomatic importance.197 In Euripides, notably, the chorus tends to be more and more secluded from the core of the action and the role of repository of traditional values which (arguably) they originally carried. This happens even in a play like Bacchae , which presents a chorus directly involved in the events; closer inspection shows us a group of Asian women which is lost and bewildered and ultimately indifferent, even hostile, to the Greek community among which the events unfold. 192 Wiles (2000) 149-51. 193 Gould (1996) 232. 194 By 'monologism' I mean the presence of one fictional level clearly established for the audience. m See Wiles (2000) 149, summarizing Harrison (1983): 'masks, like the formality of verse, create the detachment necessary if we are to contemplate horror'. 196 The analysis of choral dance offered by Scarpi (1991) 406 is suggestive for our concept of chorus as objectifying presence: the movements of the chorus along the right-left axis delimited by the two parodoi reproduces the rhythm of the sun's motion, the cosmic frame within which the action takes place. Further observations on the east-west eisodoi as 'opposites both topographically and symbolically' are made by Wiles (1997) 133-60. 197 For a statistical discussion, see Griffith (1977) 123-36. See also Dale (1969) 214 on the decrease in number of stichomythic exchange between chorus and actors from Aeschylus to Euripides.</page><page sequence="66">56 HIDDEN PATHS In conclusion, it can be argued that the mask, the chorus and the use of traditional epic features, which are among the distinctive features of the tragic genre , all share a very important effect. They all make for determining objectification and tend to preclude the possibility of any development that is unavailable to the audience. Other factors tend the same way,198 making Greek tragedy remote from the 'theatrical realism' of the modern theatre, whose spectator is 'a hidden observer looking in on a specified location through an invisible fourth wall'.199 For these reasons, non-staged implications behind events go against the tragic grain, and (short of Euripidean reinforcement) claims for them tend to lack plausibility, notwithstanding the attempts of modern critics to detect ambiguity and deceit as object of Greek tragedy.200 Having qualified the objectivity of tragic representation along these lines, we should add, however, that the development of characterization in fifth-century drama points in the opposite direction, especially with the youngest tragedian. In particular, Euripides' exploration of the inward, the private and, in some cases, the unaware as a permanent, unresolved feature of the human psyche,201 seems to have little encouragement from his own medium, whose external features still insist that the limits of the visible coincide with the limits of the object in itself: 'when the character exits, the actor changes his mask and the character ceases to exist. Just as the character is a mask, so the skene is a façade'.202 Let us now go back to our initial distinction between sense of individuality and psychological depth. As far as the first point is concerned, what we have called meagreness in characterization is a peculiar trait of Greek tragedy. It would indeed be hard to decide whether tragedy's public, normative and outward depiction of character is determined by the particular presence of such elements as the chorus, masking, and the adoption of traditional figures as characters in traditional stories; or, conversely, whether the preservation of these elements meets the requirements of that characterization, which arises for some independent cause. Either way, the tragic norms are peculiar to tragedy, insofar as lyric poetry and even epic are more sympathetic to idiosyncratic detail. 198 For instance, multiple roles for single actors (over the trilogy/tetralogy, not only a single play) makes identification with an individual less likely (see Easterling 1997b, 153). As Easterling puts it, it involves an important 'modulation, or constant renegotiation of distance' (Easterling 1997b, 172). The possibility of exploitation of the actor's recognizable voice behind the changing mask has been rightly argued by Pavlovskis (1977). 199 Rehm (1992) 36-37. Regarding these different premises of fictionality, see e.g. Flaumenhaft 1994, 80 on the 'self-conscious emerging from festival to everyday time': the festival is not perceived as a suspension of normal life, but as an insertion into it. 200 The fact that in Euripides a greater degree of fictionality is achieved underlies the contrast made by Havelock (1980), between Aeschylus' dramaturgy, made mainly of action and events, facts presented by the poet almost in the manner of an epic rhapsode (82), and Euripides' more intimate identification between characters and audience. The process from a solo reading of the play, performed by its author with the accompaniment of the chorus, to the two- and then three-actor organizations of the later plays, highlights a change of the same kind, from a performance where the audience is always reminded of fictionality, to a performance of more compact closure. 201 See Chapter II, pp. 69-70, 85-86. 202 Wiles (1997) 169. There are, however, grounds for arguing that tragic costume and mask-design evolve in the direction of specificity and 'concreteness' (see Molinari 1994b, 38, 41 ; Rehm 1992, 49).</page><page sequence="67">CHAPTER 1 : CHARACTER AND THE GREEK VIEW OF MAN 57 On the other hand, psychological depth, which involves a focus on the individual's feelings and views as disconnected from the world and from the service of the action, is developed according to the worldview presented by the single play or author. This is most evident in Euripides, where the view of the world as knowable system is questioned. The representation of character in tragedy is reconfirmed to be the product of a continuous negotiation between generic conventions and the general Greek conception of man and human life. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration both theatrical features (masking, chorus, the mythological personae) and cultural aspects (the view of self and of the human mind) as a first step towards outlining and the significant peculiarities of character in tragedy. To these elements we should always add the variable of the single playwright's artistic choice to avoid taking a deterministic view of the literary creative process.</page><page sequence="68">CHAPTER II - VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION IN THE BACCHAE : THE 'PRIVATE SELF' In order to test the validity of our model against a textual example we should now proceed to bring together the observations made in Chapter I and the representation of man in the Bacchae. In this chapter I seek to analyse the presentation of character using a working definition of self as secluded from interpersonal relations. The self, arguably, is always related to the external world through such aspects of interpersonal life as the family, citizenship, sex, and the divine world; these will be analysed in detail in Chapter III. For now I shall concentrate on those human experiences, such as madness and disease, which isolate the individual from the group and come closest to allowing an analysis of the representation of man as secluded from his referential context. In doing this, I am aware of the artificial nature of a distinction between 'private self and 'relational self. The distinction is convenient: the two aspects of 'the self are isolatable theoretically if not in practice. Three motifs emerge in Bacchae as significant of the representation of the individual in isolation: madness; sickness and cure; and tying and freeing. Madness and disease are obviously experiences that tend to seclude the individual from the social group, and to foreground the subjective viewpoint. Tying and freeing are less directly evident in their bearing on the 'private self; our interpretation will explore how 'tying* becomes an instrument of constraint and repression of the individual, self-inflicted as well as imposed from the outside. This constraining force also isolates the subject and severs its communication with the external world. The method adopted for the analysis of these motifs will necessarily vary. The first motif, madness, is foregrounded in the play through explicit verbal insistence and is a central element of the plot. Here our analysis will focus mostly on the ironic and problematizing usage of key-terms in the play,1 as well as through imagery and through events. Keywords can be neutral, positive or negative (mainly words with the roots &lt;J&gt;pev-, (70(f&gt;-, pav-). In analysing how madness relates to the construction of character in our play, our attention must focus on Pentheus and Agave. My aim is to demonstrate that the representation of these two characters as victims of mania breaks with the tradition offered by other models in Greek literature by displaying, albeit within the parameters of the Greek frame of mind, progress in the inquiry into human psychology. The second motif, disease/cure, is verbally present but not made explicit in the play as a staged fact, and so a comparison with other relevant texts becomes unavoidable in order to demonstrate the perceptibility of the motif in the play, and to consider its place within a developing view of man. The third motif, tying/freeing, is perhaps the most charged with 1 A lexical approach to some of the central motifs of the play (under the headings of 'masking', '4&gt;pf)v and 8ó£a' 'hunting', 'freedom and chains', and 'violence') was taken by Radici Colace in her article on the Bacchae (2000). 59</page><page sequence="69">60 HIDDEN PATHS psychological meanings, despite the fact that its presence in the text is limited to very concrete uses of the terms involved. This calls for a more theoretical discussion of the role of imagery in our play, which will be offered in Chapter IV. Meanwhile, comparative or explanatory reference to sources beyond Bacchae , from Homer to the Corpus Hippocrat- icum , will be offered as necessary. The discussion of madness, in particular, necessarily involves a scrutiny of psychological terminology, both in literary usage and elsewhere. The pertinence of our working concept of 'private self is sustained by the fact that some of the aspects of Pentheus' character in the Bacchae mentioned above have consistently emerged as important in numerous interpretative works on the play. First of all, the fact that psychoanalytic or psychological readings have been very successful in the scholarship on the play is an element of support of a reading of Pentheus' madness as internalized rather than a mere product of divine intervention;2 second, the separation between character and dramatic action in the play that determines an uncertainty and questionability of the dramatic events, especially in some scenes, has often been noticed.3 2.7 Madness In Bacchae , the continuity between man and world is broken. This breach involves the analysis of characters' psychology and the representation of nature as no longer intuitively known and 'taken for granted', as well as formal features of tragedy, such as the role of the chorus, which in Bacchae is deprived of any moral or cognitive authority. In many ways, we begin to see a new kind of portrayal of human beings emerging. The depiction of Pentheus the man has, in one sense, more in common with the Hippocratic view of a unified brain than with Euripides' literary predecessors:4 2 See La Rue (1968), who focuses on Pentheus' 'prurience'; Devereux (1970) and his reading of Agave's recovery scene in the light of modern psychoanalytic techniques; Sale and his approach to Pentheus as the 'patient' of a 'psychoanalytic critic' (1972) and his use of 'existentialist psychology' (1977); Slater's comments on the 'sex antagonism' and 'narcissism' that 'saturate the play' (1974) 36; Segal's frequent use of Freudian categories (1978; 1986, 268-93 and 294-312; 1997a, e.g. 185-204); Glenn's review of psychlogical views on the Bacchae (1979); Parsons' account of 'self-denial' and 'developmental task' in the characters of Pentheus in Bacchae and Theseus in OC (1988); McDonald (1992). 3 As with the psychoanalytic readings of the play, variations in interpretation have reflected a divergence about the staged events. To give two examples, the 'palace-miracle' scene (616-41) and the 'double-sight' episode (918-22) have engendered a variety of different interpretations of the actual facts happening onstage which have no precedent in any other play. Modern readers have been split between literalists - the palace actually falls apart and Pentheus actually sees 'two suns over Thebes' (see Seaford 1987) - and those preferring an illusionistic reading, whereby the earthquake is only a product of the stranger's hypnotic power (especially Verrall 1910; Norwood 1908, with a correction in 1954), and Pentheus' double view is caused by the corruptive arts of the stranger; along the same lines Di Benedetto (2004, 420) highlights the similarities between Pentheus' double sight and the symptoms of a type of hydropsy in De Morbis II. A shrewd commentary on this dichotomy between reality and delusion is offered by Castellani (1976), who argues for a symbolic and prophetic reading of Dionysus' presentation of the facts (see also Fisher 1991 and 1992; cf. below p. 183 n. 76 on Hamilton, 1974); similarly, for Kitto (1961) 381 'this miracle, however great or small, is to be essentially an event in the minds of the actors and audience'. However, the response of the reader cannot completely escape the open-endedness displayed by the text, in which a stable understanding of reality is finally lacking. I would suggest that, to a significant extent, this is due to the special status of the chorus, which does not collaborate with the characters, and is excluded from a full understanding of events. 4 Cf.

It is specially the organ which enables us to think, see and hear, and to distinguish the ugly and the beautiful, the bad and the good, pleasant and unpleasant, whether we judge according to convention or, at other times, according to the perceptions of expediency. However, the representation of character in Bacchae is vastly more complex and, not least, less mechanical. It may seem paradoxical that in the examples analysed in Chapter I, a monolithic attitude towards action, a Hegelian identification with it (the 'identity of being and willing'), was seen to be accompanied by a fragmentary, analytic presentation of the mind, while the more organic and deeply represented self of Pentheus offers instead, perhaps, the fullest example of what we are bound to see as 'development of character' in tragedy. Narrative features of the plot exhibit the same logic. In fact, our play is unusual for the sense of openness and dramatic quality it gives to the reader, the sensation that, despite the well-consolidated pattern of the story, its outcome is genuinely open and not bound to a grave supernatural predestination.6 The mind of Pentheus, conversely, seems to lack flexibility, openness and articulation. Its innerness is coherent and hardly describable from the outside, and his mental derangement appears accordingly placed in a hidden part of his personality. Pentheus does not go wrong, as does Phaedra in Hippolytus , by blindly following a part of himself which he acknowledges.7 His deviation is total and unconscious, his bond with the external world ultimately cut, and his mental processes hermetically closed; the reader, or the onlooker, is barred from an insight into them. There is no dialogue or monologue in the play to express his decision-making; it is as if an objectified description of it is no longer affordable by the man, or credible for the audience. No space is given to any hint of awareness of the situation, any suspicion. Only at 918 does Pentheus talk self-referentially about his change in perceptions: 'it seems to me that I see two suns, and two Thebes' (ôokû). His unawareness, in fact, grows with his derangement; there is no painful internal struggle in him. He accepts his own distorted perception of the external world with a sinister confidence. Crucially, in that the outcome of a story reveals much about its development, he dies ignorant and helpless without knowing to be so , while Thebes finally becomes a 5 Morb. Sacr .

Let us analyse this combination of impenetrable representation of self and openness of the action in the text. The descent which will lead Pentheus to madness is described in two sequences; 616- 46, which contains the famous 'palace-miracle', and 810-976, culminating in the 'dressing-up scene' and the journey to the mountain. The king's initial resolve of strong condemnation is progressively weakened: he is talked into wearing women's clothes and laying himself open to danger and shame, and he slips step by step into a hallucinatory dimension, which disrupts simultaneously his perception of the world and the view that the world has of him. Hallucination and transvestism are here two sides of the same coin, the (by now) compromised continuity between individual and external world. Let us analyse the 'palace-miracle' first. When first attacked by mania , Pentheus is described in the third person by the god; he is not seen on stage in this episode. He seeks to place the stranger in chains (616), but mistakes a bull for him and struggles to tie it down (618-21). Then the miracle happens: earthquake (623), flames (624) and ultimately a cķaapa, a 'phantom' (630).8 The king runs about trying to extinguish the fire (625), and ridiculously struggles against the ghost with his sword (630-31). No room for self- reflection is left in this scene: Pentheus' closing line still expresses concern for the stranger who has fled (642). A trait of the king's mania emerges at this stage from Dionysus' account of the facts, which plays on the term Gupóç. The physical manifestation of Pentheus' derangement is panting or 'shortness of breath' (620: 0vp.ov 6KTTWGÛV, 'he was panting out his wrath'; 640, TTvécov ... piva , 'breathing arrogance'). This feature characterizes Pentheus' impulsive personality at large, and it reappears in 1 132, at the moment of his death: ó piv crreváCcov öaov èTÚyxav ' èp/nwcov, 'he was groaning for as long as he had breath'. The impulsiveness and lack of control in his character, meanwhile, is repeatedly conveyed through the use of the term 0vp.ós' connoting both breath and vitality. At 673 the expression tolç yàp biKaioiç ovxi 0vp.ova0ai xPea&gt;v, 'at just things one should not be angry'9 is used by Pentheus about himself. The same idea occurs at 794, where Pentheus is accused by Dionysus of being 0vp.oup.evoç, 'raging', and at 671, where a servant does not dare speak freely, in part because of Pentheus' ò£u0up.oç, 'sharp' and royal nature. The word ©upó? and imagery linked to breathing, in fact, are almost never used in the play without reference to the king. Breathing-imagery indeed occurs at 128, where Trv£vp.a, 'breath' refers to the music of the Phrygian pipe, another significantly frenzied Dionysiac element, while 0u [iòç appears at 743, in the first messenger's speech, describing bulls 'which have previously put anger into their horns' (icàç icépa? 0vp.oup.evoi) and are nevertheless helpless against the women's attack. This is an image which might to some extent be seen as a figura of Pentheus' destiny. 0up.óç as an aspect of Pentheus' madness is therefore the exploitation 8 &lt;l&gt;áai± ' ...I ...&lt;f&gt;aei&gt;vòi&gt; a'i0ép ' (630-31). cf&gt;áa|i ' is Jacobs' correction, accepted by Dodds and Diggle, for LP's &lt;1&gt;ûç, which does not fit into the scene - Pentheus would be mistaking a fcòç for the prisoner (see Dodds 1 960, 155); a'iOép ' is Canter's conjecture for a lacuna after fyatvvòv. Seaford (2001) retains 4&gt;còç, with initiatory overtones, and reads &lt;¡&gt;a€vvr'v c'lkóv ' at 631 (following Ferrari 1985, 50); see also Luginbill (2003). An argument in support of Jacobs' reading (Jxiap. ' is that it also allows a parallel between the &lt;f&gt;áapa created by Dionysus to deceive Pentheus and the analogous pipos* aiOépoç used by Zeus, in Teiresias' account (292-93), to build a 'double' of the god after his birth and divert in this way Hera's jealous rage from the child. 9 673 is mistakenly deleted by Nauck.</page><page sequence="72">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 63 of components of his character we may trace since the beginning of the play: an arrogant and presumptuous attitude towards Cadmus and Tiresias, aggressiveness, and anxiety - as at 913, when Dionysus describes him as ottcuSovtcl t ' àaTTovôacjTa, 'striving for what should not be striven for' His madness builds up before its final outburst after 810, and seems to be 'organic' to a previous flaw of his character, despite its epiphanic and externalized nature. Similarly, in fact, the second passage cited (810-976) reveals 'neutral' traits of the king's personality which are exploited by his opponent to drag him into madness. As his derangement reaches full expression, the emergence of elements already seen as part of the king's character are more striking. First, Pentheus has a wary and puritanical view of sexuality: his main anxiety about the cults seems to concern the open sexual intercourse and other shameless behaviour that his imagination projects onto the Theban women in the wilderness. His first comment on the stranger's looks has already betrayed the importance of this issue for him: in his words at 236, referring to information received, the stranger is described as 'having the graces of Aphrodite in his eyes'. When the king faces the prisoner at 455-56, he comments: 'your locks are long, not by wrestling , flowing down right by your cheeks, full of desire. You have a skin white by contrivance..., under the shade hunting Aphrodite with beauty', and again at 353, 'stranger of female appearance'. The emphasis for Pentheus is always on Dionysus' feminine looks; the overt criticisms made to the god by the king during their confrontation also centre on hostility to stereotypical feminine flaws, such as duplicity, elusi veness, cunning.10 This weak point of Pentheus, his moralizing obsessi veness, is coupled with an attention for other people's looks and external appearance as expression of their morals. These two elements will help to engender, according to a mechanism of reaction, another feature of his madness, the voyeuristic temptation as well as the wish for transvestism which constitute the 'stuff of his madness.11 10 See e.g. Ba. 475, ev tout ' ¿KißÖf|Xeuaas', and compare Hipp. 616, where women are equated to a Kißöt|Xov ... KaKÓu, a 'deceitful evil'. See also Ba. 479, 487, 489, 491, 650, 655. A comparable passage is the description of the fox-woman in Semonides 7 (7-9): tt)v S' dXiTpfjç 0 ebç é0t)k' àXcÓTTÉKOç yuuaiKa TrávT0)v ÏÔpiv otôè piv kokův XéXT10T1V oùôèv ovôè tûv àpavóvtov One from a wicked vixen he created, expert in every trick. She misses nothing so long as it's bad, or even if it's good. 11 On Pentheus' 'voyeurism' much has been said. Even if we accept, with Gregory (1985), that voyeurism is not Pentheus' main sin, and that his eagerness to watch would have been accepted as normal by coeval male Greeks, it remains a significant fact that Pentheus never acknowledges this 'legitimate interest' to himself, nor does he argue for it - he simply admits it in a sudden outburst of curiosity: 'oh, yes, I would pay a great sum to see that sight ...' (812). Calling such eagerness sexual repression ('obsession sexuelle... qui est si souvent une preuve de déséquilibre mental', as in Defradas 1963, 127) may seem excessive, but at least it should be conceded that Pentheus' self-denial has a role in shaping his psychology. On this point, see also March (1989, 45-48), for whom Pentheus' malice about the women is the consequence of what he has heard (at 216, 233) and 'by no means his prurient imaginings' (45), as against Arrowsmith (1967, 67-68) who recognizes in Pentheus a 'prurient sexual imagination', but extenuated by his youth: 'the voyeurism which would be pathological in a grown man is an obsessive and morbid curiosity in a boy'.</page><page sequence="73">64 HIDDEN PATHS Another detail is a rigid obsession with decorum and formality. The importance of not being defeated by women12 and not making a fool of himself, along with his contempt for the two old men, Cadmus and Tiresias, who are determined to dress up and dance, finds its mirror image in the parodistic concern he shows for his own looks and his own gracefulness while dressing up as a frenzied woman, and again in his final helplessness in his mother's hands. Similarly, his tyrannical fear of all that is nocturnal or private will have an obverse in the fact that he goes secretly to the mountain, to be hidden,13 and ends up utterly exposed at the top of a tree. More generally, Pentheus displays a deep wariness of any expression of individual freedom and lack of control - for example, the dancings and wanderings of the women - just as his madness is seen to have an especially chaotic, boundless quality. This boundlessness is significantly marked by the metaphor of the 'flying mind', which brings him close to the bird-imagery that characterizes the Maenads.14 In 214 Cadmus sees him coming, and comments on his anxious, hot-tempered aspect: cbç 6tttót1Tcxi . . ., 'what a flutter he is in!'. Again, attacked by his nephew, he warns him, vvv yap tt€tt)..., 'now you are a-flutter' (332). The application of such an image to the character who, in his intentions, embodies state control and stability of mind par excellence , hints from the beginning of the play at a special weakness of the king's personality. To sum up, various elements are present in Pentheus' depiction, and converge in his final portrayal as a madman: the arrogant temper of his Gupóç, the sexual unease, the excessive concern with decency and appropriateness, and the drive to control. Pentheus' mania is complex and composite, and it emerges from aspects of his personality as it is sketched since the beginning of the play; it is not, as with Sophocles' Ajax and Euripides' Heracles, for example, linked to a single exceptional action but to a complex of inclinations and behaviours. While it is generally true that in tragedy 'madness exists in action; once the mad action is done, the man is no longer mad',15 in Bacchae it is hard to limit Pentheus' madness to a single, circumscribed element. In fact, his mental derangement begins far before the 'palace-miracle', in which the king for the first time offers a full expression of it: '[his] frenzy is more a furtherance than a reversal'.16 Allusions to the derangement, lack of common sense, or madness of Pentheus, in a transferred sense, recur from the Cadmus and Tiresias scene on, uttered by various characters: the two old men (214, 268-69, 271, 311, 326-27, 332, 358-59, 369), and the stranger (504, 506). Besides this, the focal scenes of derangement, the palace-miracle and the dressing-up scene offer a portrayal of madness not aimed towards any one end or concentrated on any single flaw or obsession.

I disagree with March (1989) 41, who does not find the reference to permanent features of the king's character a convincing explanation for his volte-face after line 810, thus splitting the plot into two parts.</page><page sequence="74">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 65 elements come into play in these two instances. In the first (the 'palace-miracle'), the king displays a control-obsession, the tendency to conceive imprisonment and ties as the best solution to his problems, a military and constraining vision of politics in the broad sense. In his hallucinations there appears for the first time the element of the bull, with all its ritual and mythological overtones. In the second passage (the dressing-up scene), different aspects of the king are highlighted: a repressed and timorous managing of temptation, an unawareness of his own choices, the taste for feminine dressing-up, and again the vision of the bull. Although these elements are harmonized in a sophisticated way in order to offer the depiction of a single person, there is an obvious difference from, say, the madness of Sophocles' Ajax or of Euripides' Heracles, which are narrowly focused and isolatable from the rest of the plot and the character.17 As has been noted by Wohlberg, 'whereas in the Heracles the hero's madness was merely a means to an end (the destruction of Heracles' wife and children and his subsequent fall), the madness of Pentheus is an end in itself insofar as it shows the power of Dionysus'- or, as is perhaps preferable, insofar as it accomplishes traits of Pentheus' character.18 Whereas in these two plays, Heracles and Ajax , it has been conventional in criticism to talk about 'Heracles' madness', or 'Ajax's madness', with Bacchae it seems more useful to talk about Pentheus as a whole human being. In line with this composite nature of Pentheus' mania , there is an evolution in the depiction of the king. We are not facing one of those tragic characters whose very matter seems to be that of action and confrontation with the world, pushed almost inexplicably to a compulsive deed, like the Aeschylean Orestes. The dialectic with the outside is in Pentheus' case developed in time,19 whereas in earlier tragedy it was characteristically expressed through a fragmentation of the psychological components simultaneously at work in an individual: usually &lt;1&gt;pf|v, vovç, ôupóç, Kapôta/Kéap, and iļ;uxf|,20 which form what we may call the 'composite model of the mind'. On the contrary, Pentheus' evolution is a furtherance; what he becomes was already included in his make-up. But there is no watershed, no decisive choice he makes or decisive event in his life, but only himself, to cause this outcome of his personality. His mental processes are described in a different way, through what we may call a 'centripetal model of the mind' as opposed to the fragmentation of the 'composite model'. Verbs, nouns, and adjectives are preferred. These are more personalized linguistic instances than the objectifying composite mind terms, and their preference is significant of a more subjective and internalized self. Such a 'centripetal' view of the human psyche will be of the utmost importance in subsequent Greek thought - it is enough to mention Plato's theory of anamnesis. It 17 This is true despite Wilamowitz's initial claims on the second, that Heracles' madness is alluded to as early as at lines 20-21 in the play and that the hero is therefore insane since before Lyssa's intervention, as his outburst of violent anger at 562-82 would show (Wilamowitz 1895, Vol. I 128ff., Vol. II 131-32). IS Wohlberg (1968) 15. 19 This is another aspect of Euripides' originality in depicting Pentheus. The representation of human life in tragedy, which we described as dismissing 'any realistic concern with time' (Chapter I, pp. 27-28), seems to approach a more naturalistic and concrete mimesis in Bacchae (see Chapter IV. 2, pp. 17 1-86). 20 A straightforward translation of these terms into English cannot be easily provided, as they could all be translated, literally or metaphorically, with 'mind', 'spirit', heart', 'soul' depending on the context: see below pp. 70-74.</page><page sequence="75">66 HIDDEN PATHS represents a development from the previous representations of psychological mechanisms, even though these are bound to the same vision of relations between individual and world. Instead of the two features - the dialogue and the objectified internal struggle - which we have observed in our examples in Chapter I, here there is a strong preference for the imagery expressive of the contrast between 'in the mind' and 'outside of the mind', as we shall see.21 In the other Euripidean tragedies we have glanced at,22 the psychological vocabulary is much more varied than in Bacchae , and the mechanism of self-referentiality is far more articulated and descriptive. Indeed, the near-absence of the two given features in our play, given its in-depth psychological explorations, may seem surprising, as criticism of tragedy has long acknowledged the analysis of decision-making and the mental deconstruction of dilemmas as instruments of its psychological quest. A statistical overview of the usage of psychological terms in the four examples of Euripidean tragedy previously quoted {Heracles, Hippolytus, Medea and Orestes) and Sophocles' Ajax, as against Bacchae itself, helps to point up the originality of our play.23 This sort of statistical comparison, however, should take into account not just the mere frequency of certain terms in the play (significant as this is). What is more interesting for us, as we ponder the verbal articulations of externalized or internalized madness, is an analysis of this terminology in relation to the self-awareness of the character to which it refers. In short, we should consider whether the view of human innerness as divisible into parts (our 'composite mind': &lt;ļ)pf)v, vouç, 0up.óç, KapôiaMap, and ipvxA)&gt; ls acknowledged by the subject, who describes his or her own emotional and mental status in such terms, or whether they are only used in the third person by an observer or an interlocutor. In Heracles , Hippolytus , Orestes , and Medea , as well as Sophocles' Ajax - five plays in which madness is foregrounded - a preference for one model rather than another is detectable, and a fundamentally monologic pattern is apparent.24 In spite of the estrangement of the tragic persona at the centre of events from his or her environment and from the comprehension of his or her dear ones, an objective, external level of 'reality' is maintained as background, enacted by the chorus but shared, in various degrees, by all the characters. In Bacchae this monologism is replaced by a plurality of points of view held by different characters. The common ground of discourse and intelligibility among 21 See below, p. 83. 22 Chapter I, pp. 14-16. Euripides' usage of this model, however, is arguably more stylized than Homer's: see in this respect the comment in Starkie (1909) 102 to Ar. Ach. 480 (to 0úp ' , ävev aKávôiKOÇ épTTopeuréa, 'oh my soul, now we must go without the chervil!'), where the composite-mind pattern is evoked in a scene of paratragoedia : 'an excellent parody of epic addresses to one's soul ... the humour lies in the fact, as Voltaire said of similar addresses in Corneille, that "nous ne sommes plus dans un temps où l'on parle à son bras et à son âme"; but Euripides affected them'. 24 Orestes is closer to Bacchae in its representation of madness as internalized, so that the identity of external influence and inner feeling is broken. Yet in Orestes this break is staged, and Electra's presence at the sick brother's bed accomplishes the objectifying function. See below, pp. 96-97 nn. 204-05.</page><page sequence="76">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 67 characters, and between characters and audience, which would render possible and meaningful a presentation of one's own mental states, seems ultimately to be lacking.25 2.1.1 Uses of the ' composite mind pattern ' Let us first consider our group of central psychological terms (&lt;1&gt;pr)v, voüs' Oupóç, Kapôia/Kéap, and tļmxf|). Among the five plays, Hippolytus displays by far the widest range and the highest frequency of the given terms (Table I):26 Play Number of lines Occurrences of composite- mind terms Bacchae 1392 17 Ajax 1420 17 Heracles 1428 13 Hippolytus 1466 54 Orestes 1693 24 ~MĪdea 1419 40 There are far fewer occurrences in Bacchae , but also in Heracles , Ajax and Orestes. The low counts for Heracles , Ajax and Orestes are less significant than they may seem. With Heracles and Ajax , one should note that the plot is focused on the hero's madness only in its second and first part respectively. In Orestes , the plot is much more complicated and includes more interlaced events (the threatened death of Orestes and Electra; the role of Tyndareus and Menelaus; the fates of Pylades, Helen and Hermione; the attack carried out by Orestes and Electra and Pylades; the ultimate reconciliation). Beyond this, Orestes' low rate of usage matches the reading offered previously of Orestes' internalized madness.27 By contrast, the low occurrence of the relevant terms in Bacchae , where the theme of madness and derangement is central and runs throughout the whole play, seems more striking. Let us now turn our attention to the speaker-object (S-O) relationship. It is important to distinguish, first, whether the composite model of the mind is used self-referentially or not and, if not, whether it is used in the presence of the person who is the object of such usage. If the speaker is the object (i.e., if S = O), we have a sequence like Medea 878-79, oùk a7TaXXax0iļcJO|iai I 0upou; ('shall I not give up my anger?'), where Medea is talking about herself. If the speaker is not, (i.e., if S f O), we have a sequence like Hippolytus 764-66, av0' (Lv I ovx óctloív èpiohw ôei va (ppéuaç ' A&lt;1&gt;po8ih~aç vóaco KaT6KXaa0q ('...and so Aphrodite sent a fearful sickness of impious passion that crushed her heart'), where the chorus are talking about Phaedra. Table II: 25 One of the ruling ideas of the play, the risks of isolation as opposed to the dangers of openness, liberation and fusion, is worked out through the presentation of Dionysiac cults and exotic maenadism, though not only through this. The issue of intelligibility between characters, as well as the relationship between man and world shaped in the play, reflects the same concern with a fracture between individual and environment. 26 See Table IV (pp. 220-27) for an overview of self-referential usage of these terms in the six plays. 27 As indicated above (p. 66, n. 24), I regard Orestes (which I cannot discuss in detail here) as offering a port- rayal of human innerness approximating to the one presented in Bacchae.</page><page sequence="77">68 HIDDEN PATHS total |S = Q 'S¿Q occurrences speaker Bacchae Ī7 2 (12%) 2 (Agave) 15 (88%) Ajax 17 3(18%) 1 (Odysseus) 14(82%) 1 (Ajax) 1 (Coryphaeus) Heracles ¡3 5 (38%) 3 (Heracles) 8 (62%) 1 (Chorus) 1 (Megara) Hippolytus *54 17(31 %) 5 (Phaedra) 37 (69%) 3 (Chorus) l(Coryph.) 3 (Hippolytus) 3 (Nurse) 2 (Theseus) Orejtej ~24 13 (54 %) 9 (Orestes) 1 1 (46%) 2 (Electra) 1 (Tyndareus) 1 (Phrygian) Medea ~4Õ 1 1 (27.5%) 10 (Medea) 29 (72.5%) 1 (Chorus) S = speaker O = object From this table Bacchae and Ajax stand out in a particular way. In Orestes , in spite of the modest occurrence of the terms there, there is significant self-referentiality (S = O) via the main character, Orestes, when he portrays himself as 'divided'. The same happens, in varying degrees, in the other three plays: Medea, Hippolytus, Phaedra, and Heracles (the characters whose psychological lives are foregrounded) are the main utterers of the self- referential expressions in the plays in question. In Ajax the avoidance of the usage of these terms by the deranged hero with reference to himself is explained by his attitude towards the external world, epitomized by the ambiguous 'deception speech' (646-92), and by the hero's mysterious allusions to his real intentions. With hindsight, all these convey the impression of an outcome planned in advance and of a pondered self-awareness (see 479-80, 581-82, 586, 690-92).28 Moreover, the real thoughts and feelings of the hero escape those around him, but after the suicide his motives are plainly revealed and understood by others. The last call of the hero upon Zeus (824, 831), Hermes (832), Helios (846, 85729), the light of the day (856, 859) and the farewell to the land of Salamis and to Athens (860-61), 'with their springs and rivers' (862) confirm an organic picture of the external world, even though Ajax perceives himself as a misfit in it.30 28 Even though Ajax is absent from half of the plot (he kills himself at line 865) he utters 3 1 3 lines in the play, the 22% of the total and the 36% of the section in which he is still alive, so that great prominence is given to his reaction to what has happened. 29 854-58 however deleted by J.F.C. Campe and others. 30 The 'appeal to the world' is present, but this is a world from which Ajax is parting for ever, and it does not have the reassuring function it has in comparable passages in other plays (see below pp. 1 3, 45).</page><page sequence="78">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 69 There is no counterpart to any of these elements in Bacchae. The composite model of the mind is used self-referentially only twice, by Agave, who displays mental derange- ment, but whose descent to madness is not described in the play and whose destiny is only under the spotlight at the end. Crucially, the composite model is never used by Pentheus in describing his own mental processes. This statistical comparison may seem pedantic or methodologically arbitrary. In my methodology, however, I have tried to take into account other parameters, in order to ensure that the originality of Bacchae here is not an insignificant idiosyncrasy among the thousands of features that must always differentiate one work of art from another, even when the works belong to the same author and share a common theme. Rather, I suggest that in this case there are grounds for considering the divergence of Bacchae from the general pattern as significant, because in other relevant respects Bacchae is not apprec- iably out of line with the other five plays under discussion. As Sullivan31 concludes at the end of her study of Euripidean psychological terms, Euripides seems to move within the tradition consolidated in Homeric and post-Homeric literature, without furthering the meaning of these terms in any particular direction. Their application seems to be generally the same in all of the five plays examined.32 We find this, for instance, if we expand our enquiry and add to the variables of speaker (S) and object (O) the additional variable of interlocutor (I). Consider the statistics for non-self- referential usages (Table III): [sio S^o^l I O = I Bacchae 5(33%) 10(67%) Ajax 6 (43%) 8 (57%) Heracles 3 (37.5%) 5 (62.5%) Hippolyt us 1 2 (32%) 25 (68%) Orestes 3 (27%) 8 (73%) lĀTdea I 16 (55%) 13 (45%) S + O : speaker different from the person described. S + O f I: speaker, person described and interlocutor are three different people. O = I : the speaker describes the interlocutor. This table displays the frequency of occurrence of the composite model of the mind as applied to a third person (S t O 1 1), and as applied to an interlocutor (O = I). There is a roughly equivalent ratio (approximately 1:2) for four of the six plays, including Bacchae itself.33 31 Sullivan (2000) 121. See also her work on psychological terms in Presocratic and tragic literature (Sullivan 1979, 1980, 1981, 1995, 1997, 1999). 32 See Table IV, pp. 220-27. 33 O = I is always higher in occurrence than S ^ O ž 1, less so in Ajax and with the exception of Medea , where much of the audience's expectation about the two deranged characters is entrusted to third-person comments on them in their absence (the nurse and the chorus' remarks on Medea at Me. 1-95; 173-212; Tecmessa' and the chorus' exchange on Ajax at Aj. 201-332).</page><page sequence="79">70 HIDDEN PATHS When we look back at Table II, three points about Bacchae are worthy of note: first, the relative poverty and low frequency of self-referential terms (S = O) in a context of the self divided into conflicting parties. Secondly, and most important, there is no instance where this composite model of the mind is used self-referentially by Pentheus, the main character. Thirdly, and conversely, there is an absence of any 'generalization of the particular principle* or of the 'appeal to the world* uttered by the mad character in a crisis, which we find in other plays such as Medea , Hippolytus, and Ajax , where general considerations based on the extension of one's own experience are part of the self- description of the character.34 Let us now consider the implications of each of our terms for the parameter of monologism/polylogism. I propose that a preference for 4&gt;pf|i; and non-specific terms, whose meaning allows for an idea of 'seat of the character',35 corresponds to polylogism, while a preference for more specialized terms, vouç, 0ujjlóç and Kapôia, corresponds to monologism. Similarly, to turn back to what was said before, a divided view of the self involves a systemic conception of the cosmos , whereas to a self-sufficient, monolithic view of human psyche is matched a less stable and less objectified view of the world-order. (i) vovç represents the intellectual function of the human mind par excellence, conceived in momentary performance as opposed to the prolonged cogitation implicit in cļ)pf)v. This concrete, circumstantial conception often allows a shift of meaning from 'entity which plans' to 'object of planning', 'plan'.36 Endowed with a relatively narrow 'rational' connotation - it does not involve feelings and emotions - it was used by philosophical authors to signify the rational principle of the universe.37 The more functional conception of vous* is evident in Aristotle's testimony as well: the philosopher defines it as an equivalent within the of what sight is for the body, ùç...èv auļiem ôipiç, ev vous*;38 again, &lt;j&gt;ûç...èv Trļ ^Xtì» &lt;a light within the soul ((¡wxA)'39 anc* rojů (f)VG€i èv f]piv (2cjTT€p öpyavov irrrápxcüv, 'one of the natural functions within us, like an instrument'.40 Aristotle claims that vouç is refined in elderly people, confirming his view of it as a skill and an instrument;41 it is untouched by pain or emotion;42 it is good or evil depending on the õpeÇiç, the 'urge' which drives it;43 and it is aimed at practical action.44 It seems, therefore, to express a more direct connection with the intention of the 34 As observed in Chapter I, pp. 13-15. 35 These are precisely the notions that will eventually develop into the idea of Tree soul', seat of the character or soul of the dead; see Furley (1956) 9. 36 See II.

Aristotle recognizes in it one of the most basic and instinctive functions, present in small children47 and weakening with age, albeit sharper (the opposite of vovç): tûv TTpcaßirrepiov oi 0U11OL ôÇeïç [lèv, aaGevciç ôé, 'the Gupóç of old people is violent, but feeble'.48 It is linked by the philosopher to erotic love, tò &lt;1&gt;iXt|tikóv,49 and its relation to strong impulses is foregrounded: it is identified with òpyf|, 'anger' itself.50 It is included among the TTCX0T1 ('affections') which are ¡ìerà ocopaTO? ('associated with the body')51 (whereas in post-Homeric usage cf&gt;pf|v, even though it has a more precise physical location, tends to lose its anatomical meaning as 'midriff to refer to more abstract mental phenomena). Gupóç can be conceived in harmony with, but more often in opposition to, the subject,52 as agent endowed with a striking independence: ò Gupòç ÔLaoTp€&lt;J)€L Kai touç àpiaTOuç dvôpaç, 'Gufioç warps the rule even of the best men'.53 In Heraclitus' famous phrase, this extraneousness of Gupóç within the person is emphasized: 0u|ico [idxeaGai xa^6™v...t|;ux"nç yap coveiTai, '0upóç is hard to combat, because whatever it wants it buys it with the soul'.54 Given that Gujiós* entails the notion of impulsive emotion, adjectival qualifications of the word tend to be essentially intensifying. Gvpoç is by definition conceived in action, or in connection to an action.55 0u|ióç is both an organ and an affection, whereas &lt;1&gt;pf|v is never conceived as external influence without a corresponding inner element.56 45 Sullivan (1995) 44; see also Sullivan (2000) 41-44. But madness is equally conveyed by the 'lack of/' derangement from' one's vous1 or &lt;|&gt;pf|V (respectively, 252, 269, 271 and 359). 46 For a useful analysis of the term's usage in early Greek epic see Caswell (1990). 47 Pol. 1334 b 22. 49 Rh. 1390 a 13. 49 Pol. 1327 b 40. 50 /?/i. 1369 a 7. ^ de An. 403 a 17. 52 //.

Aristotle includes it among the OTrXayx^» 'the inward parts' {HA 513 a 22), and frames his considerations about it within the broader discourse on animals,57 focusing closely on its location {e.g. de An. 420 b 26), dimension {PA 666 b 32), shape (fr. 296) and function in relation to blood-circulation {PA 647 b 4). Motion and perception are the main domains as far as Kapôía is concerned {PA 665 a 12), and it is linked to such basic biological functions as nutrition {PA 469 a 6). Together with voûç and Gupóç, accordingly, Kapôía is associated with momentary affections, rather than conceived as a 'seat of character'. In Homeric as well as in tragic poetry, Kapôía is a scat of passion,58 fear and courage,59 and sorrow as well as joy;60 its usage seems therefore akin to that of ôupóç, but with a more definite reference to the body. It can subsume the intellectual too,61 with a range from desire to purpose.62 (iv) In epic and drama &lt;1&gt;pr'v/(1)pév€Ç is the most frequently used psychological term, and in tragedy above all. The &lt;f&gt;pf|V is perceived as the most collaborative element, and is not described as being in conflict with other parts of the person's innerness.63 In Homer it is rarely seen as an independent active agent, while its role eventually develops in the lyric poets, acquiring a greater independence from the subject;64 however, even when person and 4&gt;pf|v are conceived as clearly distinct, their prevailing relation seems to be one of harmony. &lt;ļ&gt;pf|v, unlike vouç or 0upóç, does not have strong characteristics per se. Aristotle defines it as a ôiáCcupa,65 'frame' or 'belt', and TTapotKoôópTpa Kai c^paypóv,66 'a partition wall' or 'a fence', suggesting a neutral, 'locative-comitative' value more than a positive, functional conception, and hinting at an entity that keeps and encompasses one's innerness.67 The frequent usage of expressions such as 'out of &lt;J&gt;pf|v' and 'lacking in cfrpéveç' testifies to this neutral application.68 Accordingly, &lt;ķpr)v approaches a notion of 'seat of the character', dependent on the individual's behaviour and personal traits at the same time. It appears to some extent to disclose the deeper nature of a person. See, for example, Hippoly tus' famous reply at Hippoly tus 612, r' yXûacr' ópi¿|iox' r' 8è &lt;ļ&gt;pfļv àvcopoToç, 'it was my tongue that swore, not my 4&gt;pf|v': a person's words are contrasted with his real intentions, articulated as the (f&gt;pf)v, which remain untouched by the external 57 See PA, Resp. 58 Od., XX, 18; //.IX, 646; E.

In tragedy &lt;1&gt;pf|v is associated with a particularly wide range of emotions.71 It seems to be morally characterized as 'good' and 'evil' depending on its owner, and not by its own nature or depending on the single instance, as with vovç. In Euripides' usage, cf&gt;pf|v is accompanied by the widest choice of adjectives, far wider than for the other psychic entities, except ^uxf|. (v) ijiuxfi is the term which will subsequently develop, in the history of Greek conceptions, into the idea of 'free soul', 'individual soul'. It maintains the twofold meaning of 'life', 'breath' and 'source of life' in Homer72 and in tragedy.73 Always associated with 'vital energy', it ultimately comes to mean 'soul of the dead'. In Pindar and in tragedy we observe a development towards the sense of 'seat of self and consciousness',74 referring to intellectual75 or emotional76 aspects of the self. Aristotle's and Plato's notions are too sophisticated and specialized to belong here: however, one may say that all philosophical tradition subsequent to tragedy follows this idea of ^uxf| as close to a concept of one's unitary and individual nature, not directly evident from one's utterances and behaviour but rooted in a deeper level of human innerness.77 Euripides' usage of the word, in particular, prefigures the ensuing history of the term. In his wide application the word is extended into new semantic fields,78 but refers especially to the 'seat of one's personality', with a wide range of emotional and intellectual connotations. As remarked above, both the frequency and the variety of adjectives used with &lt;(mxf| in Euripides is greater than with the other psychological terms, except for &lt;f&gt;pf|v. To sum up: KapSia, 0upós' and vovç are the most significant terms within the 'composite model of the mind', which entrusts the description of one's mental processes to a self-presentation offered by the subject, and whereby the human mind is readable from the outside and resolvable into elements, cf&gt;pf|v and i/wxB» on the other hand, are the most suitable terms for representing a strictly individual, deeper and unfathomable level of psychological being. 69 See also S.

See also Solmsen (1983) on the development of the concept of soul from the fifth century to Plato, with 'the significant new habit of characterizing a man's or woman's personality by referring to them as e.g., a "mighty psyche a "strong-minded psyche ", a "sweet psyche '" (356). 78 See Sullivan (2000) 1 17.</page><page sequence="83">74 HIDDEN PATHS In third-person, 'external' description of psychological processes, the most significant term is (1&gt;pf|V.

NON-SELF = the speaker applies the term to someone else. Here, as before, we are primarily concerned with the non-self-referential usage of the term. In all five plays (J)pf)v is the preferred term when talking about a third person's interiority. It is the commonest term in any case and also the commonest term used non- self-referentially. Given that in Bacchae the non-self-referential usage of psychological terms in general predominates to an extent greater than in the other plays,79 &lt;(&gt;pf)v is inevitably the most significant psychological term in our play. The general observation that each of these terms is called into service in situations of crisis might seem to imply that an organic concept of free and responsible self is missing. Rather, in line with our premises, a different conception of the relationship between man and world is highlighted instead. The individual is conceived as functional to the world outside, and his self-definition is committed to a continuous dialogic process rather than to a self-sufficient, close determination.80 In the utterances which foreground this functionality, therefore, one reads part of the depiction of the character (as we have seen in Achilles' speech81 or with the appeals to the world in tragedy). We have said that such a relationship between man and world seems to be made invalid in Bacchae. We have also seen, as a consequence, that in Bacchae the description of psychological process is carried out by other means than composite-mind fixed psychological terms. These means include a preference for the more neutral term, cf&gt;pf|v&gt; and in general for what one may define as more 'personalized' linguistic instances. 2.7.2 Personalized linguistic instances of madness in Bacchae These 'more personalized linguistic instances' are the next object of our verbal analysis. Rather than the traditional psychological terms, &lt;f&gt;pf|v, vou?, Gú|ios' Kapôia/icéap, ^uxf), we shall focus on linguistic categories such as cognate words (nouns, adjectives and verbs) with the roots cļ&gt;pev-, aocļ)-, [lav-, and relevant stylistic devices. I am arguing here that the preference for adjectives and verbs, rather than the composite-mind pattern to 79 See below, p. 219, Table II. 80 Cf. Gill (1996) quoted in Chapter I, pp. 5-6, on the 'objective-participant' view of self. 81 See Chapter I pp. 17-18, 50-51.</page><page sequence="84">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 75 express mental processes, is non-neutral. The preference for adjectives or verbs is determined by a need to describe psychological experiences as unique to each individual and specific to each instance, rather than recurrent for more characters and open to generalization. Thus, the dismissal of the stock terminology of mental life (the composite mind terms) symptomatizes the lack of trust in a common, objective ground where psychological facts can be shared with others, and ultimately of an objective level where mental life can be expressed and acknowledged by all.82 While the emphasis on bodily organs associated with the composite view of mind places human psychology onstage and renders it intelligible through its relationship to a community, in the non-composite view of mind the description of mental processes is necessarily entrusted to articulated phrases or pieces of narrative. If before, in the composite view of mind, we found passages such as T want X, but my Gupóç orders Y and I am too weak to resist if, and in such passages we could read the expression of the mental situation of the character, in the non-composite view of mind the character's psyche has to be reconstructed from more devious and less direct clues. The staged utterances and actions of the character deliver a narrative, third- person presentation, as enumerated in Table II, where the non-self-referential usage of psychological terms in Bacchae is apparent. In formal terms, these non-composite para- digms feature verbs and adjectives that are grammatically attached to the subject. From the following analyses we shall see in addition a preference for inflected, personalized terms, and a problematization, subjectiflcation and relativization of them. (i) The root &lt;1&gt;pev- is used in a great variety of forms83 - for example, the verbs (ķpoveco (T think'),84 KaTa&lt;ļ&gt;pov60) (T despise'),85 &lt;jüxf&gt;pov€ü) (T am of sound mind'),86 &lt;1&gt;p£vóco (T instruct');87 the nouns à&lt;f&gt;pocrwr| ('folly')88 and £Ù((&gt;pocnjvT| ('cheerfulness'),89 the adjective aaxf&gt;pcov ('of sound mind', 'moderate', 'sober')90 and the adverb (joxppôvœç ('properly', 'moderately').91 (ii) The adjective oo&lt;f&gt;óç ('wise') - signifying wisdom as opposed to madness - is perhaps the most revealing member of the cto&lt;J&gt;- group for understanding the way in which 82 My use of 'preference' here does not necessarily assume conscious awareness on the poet's part. 83 Besides cļ&gt;pf|v itself at Ba. 33, 203 (however, 199-203 is deleted by Diggle), 269, 359, 427, 670, 850, 944, 947, 1270. 84 Ba. 196, 268, 332, 480, 483, 1 123. 85 Ba. 199,503. 86 Ba. 314, 316 (316 deleted by Kirchoff), 329, 504, 1150, 1341. 87 Ba. 792. 88 Ba. 387. 89 Ba. 377. 90 Ba. 504, 641, 940, 1002 (the text at 1002-07 is 'the hardest in the play', in Dodds' words: see Dodds (1960, 202-04). 91 Ba. 686.</page><page sequence="85">76 HIDDEN PATHS a personalized usage of any such term (oppositional and somewhat ironic) shapes the relationship between characters. The usage of oo&lt;f&gt;óç extends from the intellectual and sapiential level through a lower sense of 'cunning, clever', to the positive idea of 'wise, prudent' in an ethical and religious sense. The adjective is first used by Cadmus at 178-79, yfjpw.J aocf&gt;f)v cromou Trap àvôpóç ('a wise voice of a wise man'), and at 186, où yàp a o&lt;póç ('you are wise'), with reference to the prophet's religious and intellectual superiority in understanding the facts of the divine. It is then used by Tiresias himself, who claims that it is easy to speak well when one is ao &lt;f&gt;óç (266) while Pentheus, in the arrogance of his royal status, has a 'tongue with no restraint' (268). The reference here is to general wisdom and a sense of measure. This basic application to the 'wise, prudent, respectful of the mean' appears in the chorus' utterance, ao(f&gt;àv 8 ' á-néx^tu TTpamSa &lt;¡&gt;péva té I TTepiaaüv TTapà (|&gt;(a)tüjv (at 427, 'to keep a wise heart and mind away from excessive men') and in Dionysus' words to Pentheus, 8ó£ei tiç à|ia0eî oo&lt;ķa Xéyoov oük éu cķpovelv (at 480, 'to an ignorant man one will seem when speaking wise things to have no sense'). The same elevated ethical sense is again operative elsewhere: at 1 151-52, where respect for the gods is regarded by the messenger as ao&lt;ļ&gt;coTaTov...KTiļpa ('the wisest... possession') for men; in the controversial choral passages at 877 and 897, ti tò ao&lt;f&gt;6v; ('what is wisdom?')92 and at 1005, tò aocpòv ov &lt;f&gt;0ovù ('I do not envy cleverness'),93 again uttered by the chorus. In all the other occurrences94 the sense is of practical skill, cleverness, competence, dexterity. The adjective oo&lt;f&gt;óç is of course of very common occurrence in Greek, and covers a wide semantic field; nonetheless, the sense implied in each case is in a significant relationship with the character involved. In 479, Pentheus is accusing the stranger of trying to trick him with cunning word- play; the god's answer is: 'to an ignorant man (apa06t) one will seem when saying wise things (ao&lt;f&gt;a) to have no sense (ouk eī) &lt;1&gt;pov€Ív, 480)'. The god invokes the general meaning of the term, 'wise, sensible', which is used (with a lack of pertinence in answering which marks the god's stichomythia with Pentheus throughout) in response to an accusation of cunning. Thus, while the king's concern is with an excess of cleverness 92 877/897 'nec de sensu nec de numeris constat' Diggle (q ti Willink for mss. f| tí tò. tò deleted already by Paley). I interpret the line in the negative sense as 'cleverness, cunning, sophistry', or, more generally, 'questionable wisdom', following Dodds's punctuation. This line has prompted much debate, centring on whether it is to be read as a 'genuine question' or a 'contemptuous rejection', in Winnington-Ingram's words (1966, 34-37). See Dodds (1960) 186-88; Willink (1966) 229; Roux (1972) 174; Cropp (1981); Oranje (1984) 159-66; Leinieks (1984) 178ff.; Giudice-Rizzo (1987) 155-64; Rijksbaron (1991) 109-13; Seaford (1994) 402- 03; Reynolds-Warnhoff (1997), who reads tò ooýóv as specifically representing 'the particular wisdom possessed by the initiates to the cult of Dionysus' (100); Di Benedetto (2004) 133, 340 for a comparison with the terminology and themes of Protagoras' Dissoi Logoi' Casali (1989), who argues for the proverbial character of the expressions tí tò ctc xf&gt;óv and ö ti KaXòv &lt;f&gt;íXov, and points to a possible allusion to Sappho's famous priamel in fr. 16 (a relationship already noted by Rosenmeyer, 1968, 164): on this last reading the Maenads' question would be a genuine one, to which they reply with a celebration of victory over the enemy. A positive interpretation of oixfróv in these lines is also adopted by Seaford (2001) 1 15; 218-19. 03 1 follow here Dodds' punctuation and his correction of P's &lt;f&gt;0óv to. 94 Ba. 203 (deleted by Diggle), 395, 641, 655, 656, 824, 839, 1 190.</page><page sequence="86">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 77 (e.g. 475, 479), the god pretends to misunderstand it as an accusation of madness (oùk eu c ppoveiv , at 480), thereby shifting the issue from the more superficial point of being deceptive to a question of value (crocia, 'wisdom'); and he does this while calling his opponent àp.aOf)ç ('ignorant', 480). In this way, our attention is refocused onto the deeper importance of the words which prompted the king's accusations, concerning the god's nature and rights of worship, in the first place. Thus, a term that is at first sight uncontroversial has two meanings for the two characters, and this doubleness itself characterizes the relationship between the two opponents, shaped throughout the play by misunderstanding and shifts of meaning. Moreover, the frequency of the term's use in different contexts - added to the use of cognate words, which we shall analyse in due course - relativizes its meaning for the audience. After 479, in fact, ao&lt;f&gt;- is barely used except in the dialogue between the god and the king, and in a very pragmatic sense, referring to matters such as Pentheus' opportunity to dress up, the advantages of spying on the Maenads in disguise, and so on. After the problematization òf its deeper meaning of 'wisdom', it is lowered to the level of 'success in a task', with an increasingly sinister implication. The god sarcastically praises Pentheus as oo&lt;1&gt;óç (as if wise) just as he is falling further into the trap, thus without even being &lt;jo(1)Óç in the limited sense ('clever'). The same ironic effect accompanies Agave's use of the term, ó Bcxkxloç KwayéTdç I aocfròç ao&lt; pûç àvêm'' ' èm 0fjpa I tovôé [laiváSaç ('Bacchus the hunter, clever, cleverly swung Maenads against this beast', at 1 189-91), where she praises the god as oo&lt;1&gt;óç for having led her to hunt and kill her own son. The juxtaposition of the two meanings, the pragmatic one ('clever') and the sapiential one ('wise'), clearly separable from one another in semantic terms, but always connected in the reader's reception, enforces the depiction of Pentheus' folly, Agave's helpless derangement, and the god's elusive status. With hindsight, the pride of the two elderly men at the beginning of the play, pride in their having made a choice which a (jo&lt;póç man would make,95 looks even more significant in its relation to the main theme. The error of intellectual and familial pride leads to the same ruin as the error of royal arrogance and feminine jealousy, in Pentheus' and his mother's case, and the ideal of oo&lt;ļ&gt;ia is treated with the same negative realism. The abstract noun crolla, significantly, appears only in the chorus's utterance tò cjo&lt;1&gt;òv 8' où crocia ('cleverness is not wisdom', at 395), in the first stasimon. After the contrasting presentation of Pentheus and the two elderly men, the chorus performs a hymnic praise of the god's cult and rite and the pleasures of his religion, and attacks the foolish arrogance of men who do not appreciate the pleasures of a peaceful, pious life. The chorus constitute, in fact, the only voice in the play to make such 'wisdom' into an abstract noun: the use of tò ao&lt;ļ&gt;6i&gt;, 'cleverness, dexterity', in a decisively negative sense, is also confined to the choral lyrics.96 Classical scholars are increasingly reluctant to believe that any single formula can be satisfactory to describe the role of the tragic chorus. However, we may fairly consider the role of the chorus in Greek tragedy as location of an authority, but with its 'response no more protected from fallibility than any other'.97 As is 95 Ba. 179, 186; similarly 196, póvoi yàp eù &lt;f&gt;pououļieu, 'we are the only ones with sense'. 96 Ba. 395, and the controversial passage at 877/897. 97 Gould (1996) 231.</page><page sequence="87">78 HIDDEN PATHS clear from the extant tragedies, in fact, the tragic chorus seems to possess a communal voice which is generally reliable, but which often springs forth from a 'low' status. If not marginality, estrangement, and emergency, then at least anonymity seems to define its condition. It tends to represent either the weakest and most marginal, or the average, 'popular' voice: in general, it works as a 'contrasting device' to the given actors in the given play.98 Bacchae is no exception: the chorus are women, Lydian and therefore foreign, and the object of persecution. Moreover, their ignorance makes it difficult to see them as the repository of a higher theological wisdom. They ignore their leader's true divine identity, are subject to the same fear of the palace earthquake as the characters proper, and are also afraid their fellow-worshipper will not be able to free himself from Pentheus' prison. Considering the particular status of this chorus as especially alienated from the environment in which they find themselves, we notice that in the context of a problematized usage of words its exclusive evocation of the 'pure' concept of wisdom in ethics and religion has, in part, a characterizing effect. The fact that the abstract nouns crocia and tò oofyòv are specifically uttered by this chorus tends either to compromise the seriousness of the debate on values, or else moves it away from the intellectual, political world, which is finally discredited. The word ao&lt;J)ia|j.a ('clever invention', 'captious argument') is also used in such a way as to bring out the deep misunderstandings between different characters. aocf&gt;iaļj.aTa is the word used by Dionysus to describe the arguments of the female relatives of Semeie, who refuse to believe that the baby is Zeus' son (30); and Dionysus' ethical claims (488: mv iipipq to y ' a'iaxpòv èÇeúpoi tis* âv, 'even in the daytime one might discover the shameful') are described similarly by the king as ao&lt;ļ&gt;L(j|iaTa he will pay dearly for.99 This word evokes the verbal communication and social intercourse of the human world.100 It is essentially derogatory, and readily applied, from the god's perspective, to the Theban women's rumours. As Pentheus does not suspect the divine nature of the stranger, his 98 See Gould (1996) 226-27. The necessity of respecting the chorus's specificity and variety of voices, against any attempt to reduce it to a formula, has in recent times been widely acknowledged (see also Silk 1999; Goldhill 1996). The marginality, helplessness and weakness of the choral group of Asian Maenads in Bacchae does not in itself represent a novelty, and hence I cannot agree with Segal's view, that 'the city reflected in the Bacchae has no communal center because there is no chorus of citizens who can speak as a community of involved fellow citizens' [my italics], whereas 'in the majority of Greek tragedies this collective voice belongs to members of the city or of the household whose fortunes are closely identified with those of the protagonists' (Segal 1997b, 65; 67-68). Not all choruses of extant tragedies are helpless and victimized (see PV, Oresteia ; Ajax , Oedipus Coloneus ; Heracles, Iphigenia Aulidensis, to give a few examples), but some indeed are (Aeschylus' Supplices', Euripides' Supplices, Troades, as well as Bacchae itself). Conversely, most choruses utter long speeches (or songs) with a generalized sapiential, moral or theological content (as the chorus in Bacchae do), and in a high, and often intensified, style (see Silk 1999). In Bacchae the coupling of marginality and factual ignorance, elevated style and overwhelming sapiential content seems to betray an ironic, problematizing purpose as far as the ideal of ooýía is concerned. 99 Ba. 489. 100 Contrast, but also compare, the use of the verb ooýíCcú ('I am clever', 'I deal cunningly') by Cadmus, at 200, oùSèv ao&lt;f&gt;ičópea0a toloi ôaípoaiv ('we do not exercise cleverness in the eyes of the gods'). There are problems with the passage, not least the fact that Cadmus does indeed make use of sophistic arguments about the gods (see Seaford 2001, 169). Diggle deletes 199-203 as interpolated, Musgrave proposes oiS '6vao4&gt;i£ópea0a to justify the dative and Seaford (2001) 169-70 suggests oùô ' el acx1&gt;iCópea0a, 'not even if we employ subtle intellect, with respect to the gods, on ancestral traditions'.</page><page sequence="88">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 79 insistence on Dionysus as sophistes, trickster, casuist, is not unexpected either, yet cannot help but recall the accusations of the god in the prologue, and underline the king's misinterpretation of facts and his superficial understanding of true wisdom. (iii) The third group, comprising words with the root pau- , carries the strongest connotations. The chief words in question are pauta ('madness'),101 pa'tuopat (T am furious', T am mad'),102 èKpatuoj (T drive mad'),103 èppauf|ç ('mad'),104 patudç ('mad').105 As with the cro&lt;J&gt;- group, we find an important oscillation between a negative and a positive meaning. We have pauta as the derangement inflicted by divine punishment (in Dionysus' prologue, with reference to the women: at 32-33, avràç ék 8opcou qScTTpria' èyd) I pauím?, 'myself I stung them with frenzies from their homes'); at 36, è$£pr|ua SœpaTcou, 'I drove them mad from their homes'); then, as the gift of divine inspiration (at 305, of panic-stricken soldiers: pauta 8è Kal tout ' earl Atouúaou Trapa, 'this too is a madness from Dionysus'; at 301, of prophetic skills: Xéyetu TÒ péXXou touç pepriuÓTaç ttoicÎ, 'he [the god] makes the maddened speak the future'; at 130, patu ope voi SáTUpot, 'the frenzied satyrs'). Then, we have the trivial, and seemingly hyperbolic, usage of the word to designate human foolishness and misjudgement: this is mainly with direct reference to Pentheus (pa'tuq and pepquas', 'you are behaving madly' and 'you are mad', at 326 and 359 respectively, both on the lips of Tiresias), or to reckless presumptuousness and indirectly to Pentheus, in the words of the chorus (399-400, patluopeutou otSe TpÓTTOi, 'these are the ways of men who are mad'; at 887, aùv patuopéua 86£a, 'with mad judgement'; at 999, pa veioa TTparriSi, 'with maddened mind'; see also 981, where Pentheus is called a XuaocoSq KaTaaKorrov, a 'frenzied spy on the Maenads'). Finally, we are reminded of the theme by the many mentions of the Maenads themselves,106 also referred to as èppaveìs*, 'frenzied' (at 1094, by the second servant). All in all, a predictable identification of pauta with any one pattern of behaviour (ecstatic possession or impiety towards the gods) is precluded. By the time we finally hear Cadmus' explanation to Agave at 1295 (épáur|T£, 'you were mad'), the initial meaning of the word (the women had been possessed by Dionysus) is no longer sufficient to cover all the implications assumed over the course of the play. To conclude, madness is a gift, an initiatory state, the product as well as the source of ignorance and stupidity, and the means as well as the aim of divine punishment. The Theban women, their king, and also the Asian Maenads, apparently opposed to one another in the action and ideology of the play, are brought together by the same verbal insistence on some instance of pauta - long before Pentheus changes his clothes to follow the women up the mountain. With so many examples of 'mad behaviour' (and even Cadmus and Tiresias are accused by Pentheus in this sense: the first of 'having no sense', 101 Ba. 33, 305. 102 Ba. 130, 301, 326, 359, 399-400, 887, 999, 1295. ,(" Ba. 36. 104 Ba. 1094. 105 Ba. 52, 102-03, 224, 570, 601, 829, 915, 956, 981, 984, 1023, 1060 (paii/á8ú)v...i&gt;ó0Q)i/ P; 'iaviáSuv...vòou)v Jackson), 1062, 1075, 1107, 1143, 1191, 1226. 106 See above, p. 79 n. 105.</page><page sequence="89">80 HIDDEN PATHS with the expression tò yfjpaç...voOv oik exoy at 252, and the second of being ávoiaç ... ÔLÔdaKaXov, a Teacher of folly', at 345), madness is afforded a rich instantiation in the play, whereas the obverse, mental soundness, is left elusive. In both cases, albeit for different reasons, the audience or reader has no specific sense of sanity or madness as a fixed point. In Bacchae the theme of mental derangement is also conveyed by anaphoric repetition of the same words or group of words either by the same character or in juxtaposed utterances by different characters. It is of course a familiar feature of Euripides, in particular, that repetitions of words inform the writing, especially in choral odes,107 and often connote a greater degree of emotional participation, or pathos, or immediacy; moreover, in this chorus's utterances, they sometimes have a ritual force, as in the dramatization of a religious procession.108 For all these reasons, anaphora and anadiplosis are particularly abundant in Bacchae , and scattered throughout the text,109 above all in the chorus's lyrics.110 Besides its other reasons for using repetition, however, this chorus is also a collective participant in Dionysiac madness, and the line between (say) ritual repetition, emphatic repetition and the deranged intensity of repetition is often hard to draw. We see this, early on, in the cries &lt;L ïté ßaicxai, | ai ïté ßctKxai ('O onward Bacchants, o onward Bacchants', 152-53); in the religious protestations, peí 8è yaXaicTi ttcôov, peí 8' oiko) I pet 8è [leXiaaáv véicrapi (The ground flows with milk, it flows with wine, it flows with the nectar of bees', 142-43); in the initial question, rlç óSco, tlç o8û; ('who is in the road? who is in the road?', 68); in various invocations to the gods, as at 370-71 (' Oaia TTOTva 0eah&gt;, l'Oaia, 'Purity, queen among gods, Purity...'), or at 412 (Bpópie Bpópie, 'Bromios, Bromios...'). Then again, and more subtly, relevant repetitions occur in the dialogue between Pentheus and the god, where they are developed as a function of the 'sophistic weapon' used by Dionysus, and are also part of that discussion and problemat- ization of values which we have seen to be central to the treatment of key terms in the play. At 649-50, the god claims that, whatever Pentheus would decide to do, Xúaei pé Tiç ('someone will free me'), and the king answers tis*; ('who?'). The use of the homophonous pronoun, in this case, underlines the misunderstanding that is central to the whole dialogue: as the god pretends to rely vaguely upon a non-specified defender, Pentheus is still following the line of official enquiry. Likewise, at 655-56 the repetition of the word oofyóç, considered above,111 draws attention to the problematic nature and relativity of the concept of wisdom, used as a double-edged weapon by the two opponents. 107 Cf. Breitenbach (1934) 214-20; 230; 234. 108 For example the formula preluding the ritual act, tí? óôú, tí? òôtò; (68), 'who's on the street?', meaning that those who are on the street should make way for the procession. 109 See also IV.7, pp. 207-10 for the use of polyptoton and word-play in Bacchae. 110 Ba. 68, 83, 107, 116, 152-53, 370-71, 412, 415, 537 (deleted by Bothe), 563-64, 582, 584, 586, 986, 992, 1 177, 1 181-82, 1 183; see also 576, 577, 595 where Dionysus exchanges verses with the Maenads. 1 1 1 See above, pp. 76-77.</page><page sequence="90">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 8 1 The device recurs in the messenger's report on Pentheus' death (1065), 112 in the final mourning scene between Cadmus and his daughter (1259, 1320-21, 1384-86), and, more significantly for us, in the scene between Agave and the chorus, when she arrives from the mountain (1168 ff.). In this last case, the repetition of the mad woman's words by the chorus indicates the incredulity and repulsion felt by the latter at her female pride in her 'prey', and offsets her satisfaction by underlining certain facts - that Agave is no youthful hunter, and that the booty she is carrying is her own son's head - which make her madness apparent. The real world and the world of delusion into which the god has cast the whole city of Thebes are juxtaposed: 'From where in the wild (do you come)', ask the chorus (1 176), and Agave answers 'Cithaeron'. 'Cithaeron?' repeat the chorus, more with conscious grief than with insincere surprise (1 177). 'Who was the one who struck?... Who else (but you)?', they continue (1178-81). tò Káôpou... ('Cadmus'...'): tl Káôjiou; ('Cadmus' what?') (1181-82). The repetition here is the first stage of Agave's anagnorisis , as her enthusiasm is echoed by the bitter awareness of the chorus. In 1184, repulsion and incredulity mark the gap between her delusion and the sad reality: '±€T€xé vvv Goivaç. I ti |i6T€Xto, r'a'iov; ('partake then of the feast'. 'What, am I to partake, poor wretch?'). More ironic is 1193: èTTaivetç; èiTaivd), 'Do you praise?'. 'I praise'. At 1197, when Agave shows her prey, the chorus comment, 'an extraordinary one', and Agave replies, 'in an extraordinary way' (Trepiaadv; 7T6piaaûç). Notwithstanding the fact that anaphora is indeed an ordinary enough feature of poetic language,113 it seems in our play to become a means by which the verbal expression of manic obsession and the doubleness of reality are brought to, or revealed to be on, the same level; the symptom and the internal cause are equated in human experience. Moreover, the reiterative idiom is a typical feature of the representation of 'mad behaviour', the external expressions of which are actually close to ecstatic, mystical forms of behaviour.114 All in all, in our play psychological relationships and moods are presented in a different way from other madness plays. In Bacchae the expression of a character's mental states is no longer entrusted to the traditional and expected self-presentation, where the composite model of mind is used and a dialectic with an external influence is highlighted. In particular, the close and impenetrable psychological portrayal of Pentheus is alien to the self-referential description of mental processes found in the portrayals of Phaedra or Medea, and displays a different intelligibility from the outside. The use of relevant stylistic devices, from repetition to imagery (what we called 'personalized stylistic devices') replaces the composite-mind model. These devices are obviously present in other plays as well, but in Bacchae they are overwhelmingly developed. What is the significance of this drifting away from the usage of composite-mind terms, especially in a self-referential way? What is suggested by the predilection for more 112 Here we have the triplication iccnfj-yev ryyev rjyev (4he brought it down, down, down'), characterized by Diggle as 'unique in tragic trimeters' (Diggle 1998, 45). 1,3 And also used in Bacchae for ordinary purposes such as emotional underlining, even at mad moments {e.g. Ba. 1 1 83) - though even such cases are more noteworthy then the 'inconsequential short-term repetitions' (Silk 2000, 172) often ascribed to tragic writings. 114 E.g. Ba. 68, 83, 152-53, 161, 537, 576, 600, 977, 986, 992.</page><page sequence="91">82 HIDDEN PATHS personally inflected devices, such as those we have just discussed? I suggest that the composite-mind model largely assumes that mental processes can be verbally expressed by the subject and read from the outside, and implies an objectified view of the world, where a systemic order is taken for granted. The absence of self-referential usage of these terms in Bacchae denounces a disillusion about the possibility of understanding one's mental states and communicating them to others. In contrast, a more subjective and personalized view of characters is implicit in the preference for style as expression of character. There is one further element: how can we interpret the preference in Bacchae for a neutral psychological term, &lt;1&gt;pf|v (even within an overall lower usage of the composite- mind terms), as opposed to terms with stronger connotation such as vouç, 0u [iòç and KapÔia?115 It is useful here to recall and compare Rohde's description of another neutral psychological term, ipvxri, as 'inactive while the body is active',116 as deprived of the status of a specific attribute of the body, as separable from it. Bremmer carries this consideration further, acknowledging in the Homeric iļwxf| the predecessor of the modern idea of free-soul, and emphasizing similarities between the two concepts: 'both are located in an unspecified part of the body; both are inactive and unmentioned [my italics], when the body is active; both leave the body during a swoon; both have no physical or psychological connections; both are a precondition for the continuation of life; both represent the individual after death'.117 In Bacchae the Greek word ipvxr] is used only twice: at 75-76, with the meaning 'life', and at 1268, in the so-called 'psychotherapy scene', when Cadmus asks Agave: tò ôè TTTOTļGev tó8 ' 6 TL OTļ tjwxíi irápti; ('are you still fluttering in your psycheV) Interestingly, the term is used precisely in the context of a mind-recovering procedure that has been aptly likened to a psychoanalytic session. In this scene a layered, organic view of the mind and of Agave's personality are disclosed, where stability and disturbance coexist simultaneously without one being foregrounded as 'self in opposition to 'external influence'.118 In making this claim, I am not attempting to argue that Euripides shares the common modern understanding of psyche as made of a conscious and an unconscious. However, the depiction of Pentheus hints at a presentation of human beings which is not plainly and naturally readable from the outside any longer, yet is ultimately a mystery, divorced from his own world. In Bacchae this presentation is not apparent in the usage of The variety of psychological terms associated with Medea's or Phaedra's utterances is replaced, with Pentheus, by a preference for &lt;J&gt;pf|v and cognate words, with the in-out imagery of cļ&gt;pf)v, flight from the (frpeveç , and disease of the (ppéveç, always described externally by a third party. Whereas Medea's mental processes were observably deconstructed by herself and painfully felt through her self-awareness, Pentheus' c()pf|v remains an unsolved conundrum, an impenetrable unit which explains itself through his mere external behaviour. 1,5 See above, pp. 70-74 for the discussion. 1,6 Rohde (1925) 7. 1,7 Bremmer (1983) 21. 118 See below pp. 97-100.</page><page sequence="92">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 83 As the Icing's mind, exemplified by the term 4&gt;pf|i&gt; and expressed through personalized stylistic devices, is not deconstructed into conflicting or coexisting parts, the dialectic with the outside world is expressed through the in-out theme and imagery, which reflects the movements of this impenetrable self within the world. These in-out oppositions match the Homeric view of feelings as momentary, consequential affections; yet here the king's behaviour is harmonized with the play's particular terms of reference. The in-out movement replaces the coexistence, in one man, of opposite states of mind and mood, and characterizes the play at many levels. It is worth observing the use of noun complements of space, of compound verbs prefixed with ck ('out of), Trapa ('from', 'by', 'beyond'), airó ('from'), eiç ('into'), and of the adverbs ('outside'), 6 aco ('within'), evôov ('inside'). All these recur with reference to mental soundness119 and human identity120 as well as to concrete domains (city,121 household and palace,122 mountains and other places of threat,123 flight and imprisonment,124 clothing125). There is a noticeable tendency, in our play, towards definition of space inside and outside the palace and the city, so that much of Pentheus' mental surrender is played out on the threshold of his palace, while the journey from Thebes to Cithaeron is made in different ways by different characters.126 The palace is, in general, a conventional feature of the tragic stage;127 yet once again a convention of the genre seems to be used as a non-neutral instrument to define characters. It allows a spatial movement, but it also reflects a concrete course of events and of mental development, for Agave, Cadmus and Pentheus. Pentheus overcomes the sense of shame, leaving the centre of power and familial safety by going to the wild mountains through 'hidden paths', òôovç èpruiouç.128 Cadmus suggests using a chariot to escape to the mountains, (oükouf öxoiaiv eiç opoç TT6páao|iev;),129 revealing that his newly- acquired 'strength' is self-delusional, while his second return, carrying his nephew's torn body, resembles a funeral procession (€7T€a0€ p.oi fápovreç äQXiov ßdpo? I nev^écos*, ?TT€&lt;T0e, 'follow me carrying the miserable weight of Pentheus, follow...').130 Agave's return, on the other hand, is ironically triumphal. Each character lives the journey which separates the mountain from the city in his or her own terms. As we have already said, the analogy between city and mind can be defined as an analogy only in our response: the fall of Thebes is the fall of its king, and the path which separates and joins together the 1,9 Ba. 359, 850; 853; 1270. 120 Ba. 1331. 121 Ba. 48; 215; 239; 312; 331 0úp aCc; 1145, 1223. 122 Ba. 32, 36, 1 18, 170, 185, 217, 593, 636, 638, 646, 754, 827, 843a, 914, 930, 1313, 1369, 1370. 123 Ba. 228, 856, 902, 1 169. 124 Ba. 239, 352, 452, 848. 125 Ba. 928 (twice), 935, 1115. 126 See MacKay (1996) on the mountains as articulation of a 'sacred space' and on the 'pattern of entrances and exits' in Bacchae (47), and Friedrich (1990) on city and mountain as dramatic opposites in the play. 127 See Wohlberg (1968). 128 Ba. 841. 129 Ba. 191. 130 Ba. 1216-17.</page><page sequence="93">84 HIDDEN PATHS political organization and the wild mountain is also, concretely, a figure for the common human share of two different sides of the mind, and for the experience of being human. This analogy is observable in the use of the same inside-outside movement applied to the house (mainly designated by the words Sopoç and 0ÎK09): not only the royal dwelling and the political centre of the city, but also the hearths from which the women are dragged by the god and from where they snatch children in their frenzy.131 This image is also applied to the mountains, as wilderness from which to make return132 or, in Pentheus' view, to force the women's return;133 and it applies to the prisons134 which symbolize the king's power. Finally, it is applied to the mind: èÇépriva, 'I drove mad' (36), 6Kcnr|(JOv ypevcòv, 'put him outside his mind' (850), e£(o...6Xaúvü)v tou &lt;1&gt;pov€Îv, 'driving off the course of sanity' (853). We can now look back at what was previously said about the man-world relationship as problematized in Bacchae. The vision of the world here is not a reliable background, but reflects the mental experiences of the characters. We pointed this out in connection with 'appeals to the world' and 'generalization-devices', and we noted that a reliable background is absent in Bacchae in the form in which it usually occurs in Greek dramatic literature.135 The use of in-out imagery in the play is somehow the counterpart of that missing reference to the world as objectifying presence; the character does not resort to it in emergency or in moments of choice, yet it is the world that mirrors and patterns the character's inner processes. At the beginning of Chapter I this men- world analogy was identified as a Presocratic constant;136 in Bacchae an opposite view within the same parameters of man -cosmos continuity begins to emerge. We can usefully recall Sullivan's remark about the distinction between psychological and physical in the representation of man in early Greek thought. She says: 'there is some perception of difference, but we encounter a continuum of physical and psychological rather than a sharp division between the two'.137 This notion of continuum is appropriate for defining the in-out relation as well as the individual-world relation. In classic Greek depictions of mankind the accent seems to fall on the 'out' end of this continuum.m In Bacchae a step towards the other end of the continuum , the psychological, internal one seems to be taken. Thus, Pentheus' rigidity and the unity of his psyche (undetectable more than splittable into parts) reflects a helpless view of the world, a world which escapes human comprehension and cannot offer a straightforward salvation. 131 Ba. 32, 217, 754, 1313, 1368-69; and, metaphorically, 1370 fyvyàs €k OaXdpow, 'fugitive from the chambers*; 118, à(f&gt;' Iotův Trapa Ke ptá 8a) v, 'away from their looms and shuttles'. 132 Ba. 1 169. 133 Ba. 228. 134 Ba. 227. 135 See Chapter I, p. 12 for our notion of 'dramatic literature'. 136 See Chapter I, p. 11. 137 Sullivan (1995) 17; see also Sullivan (2000) 119, and Easterling (1973) 19: 'Aeschylus and his contemp- oraries . . . interpreted human experience as part of a larger continuum, the total working of the universe' . 138 See Padel (1992) 51 : 'In all Classic Greek genres ... outer and inner world explain and influence each other. But in the fifth century, the dominant influence is not the inner world, as in our own Freud-framed era, but the outer' .</page><page sequence="94">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 85 Rohde's and Bremmer's definition of the Greek ipvxrj ('inactive while the body is active'; 'inactive and unmentioned when the body is active') finds - I suggest - points of contact with the Pentheus model, not so much because of what is said in Euripides' play (notwithstanding analytical and psychoanalytical readings of its familial relationships, transvestism, gender issues), as for what is not there.139 At the risk of paradox, I would argue that the omission of psychological, objective self-awareness in Pentheus reveals a higher level of psychological insight. A further parallel can be found in Orestes , the other play which displays a newly internalized depiction of madness.140 In Orestes too the self-analytical mechanism is blocked, although the stable presence of a companion, Electra, during Orestes' crises still allows the audience to participate in the character's experience of derangement; in Pentheus this evolution seems to be completed. Dodds was the first to ponder the Greek 'habit of explaining character or behaviour in terms of knowledge', and to note the corollary, that 'if character is knowledge, what is not knowledge is not part of the character'.141 The intellectual approach to ethics which will characterize Socrates' thought shares a common root with the Homeric expressions 'to know', 'to remember' or 'to have forgotten' a given action, attitude or virtue, meaning 'to be such a person as to perform the given action or possess the given virtue'.142 The line between internal and external - notwithstanding all the caveats required to make such a distinction - is the line between what the individual knows about his impulses and motivations, and what he is compelled to do without being conscious of it. Pentheus falls into the second category, in the sense that he is completely unaware of what he is going through, and formally the causative process in his descent is completely externalized. A deranging divine force, Dionysus, is even present onstage as one of the chief characters of the play, uniquely in the landscape of extant tragedies. The Homeric equation between knowledge and ethics is refined, in our play, in a Socratic direction.143 A human being is made of what he knows, as in the quoted Homeric idioms, but partly he is also, precisely, made of what he does not know. I suggest that to a Greek audience, accustomed to the staging of detailed descriptions of mental processes such as Medea's, Pentheus' unawareness and silence would be striking by contrast.144 139 It is therefore difficult to agree with Oranje's statement, that 'in Pentheus... we are dealing with an imaginary person... thought of by the poet not in terms of his personality, but in terms of the action within which he must operate... we can best look for a reliable answer in the action' (Oranje 1984, 21). Similarly difficult is Guidorizzi's reading of our play's characters as lacking in 'character, in the sense of the stable possession of psychological qualities... in which the ethos of the characters [usually] finds its true and deep identity' (Guidorizzi 1999, 188-89; my translation). To read Bacchae's characters merely as 'an empty space, occupied by the delusion of the god possessing them' disregards the crucial role played in the play by lack of awareness and of self-reflection as non-neutral features of character itself. 140 See p. 66 n. 24; 96-97 nn. 204-05. 141 Dodds (1950) 17; see also Adkins (1970) 47; Pelliccia (1995) 92. 142 As in II. XXIV, 41, Xétüv 8 '¿&gt;9 äypia ol8ei&gt;, 'a lion that knows (is capable of) savage ways'. 143 Even though Euripides' conclusions seem ultimately to be 'diametrically opposed to the Socratic thesis', insofar as his Weltanschauung is, by comparison, 'pessimistic and irrationalist' (Dodds 1929, 103). 144 Di Benedetto (2004, 425) notes how in tragedy 'Aeschylus' Agamemnon and Euripides' Pentheus are the two most relevant unaware characters', a parallelism underlined by textual similarities. Both Dionysus and Clytemnestra will be responsible for the death of Pentheus and Agamemnon respectively, and they both issue a</page><page sequence="95">86 HIDDEN PATHS In Chapter I145 1 distinguished between psychological depth and sense of individuality, the first being 'a profound attention to human motivation', and the second 'a more superficial and itemized attention to the concrete and the private particulars which shape one's individual, daily life'. In Euripides the two categories begin to converge, through an attention to prosaic and realistic detail. Pentheus's 'self-censure' as instrument of psychological description offers a good instance of this evolution. In conclusion: when we consider the frequency of certain psychological key-words in the Greek tradition, and Euripides in particular, we find that Bacchae uses them less often; and when they are used, they are never applied by Pentheus self-referentially. From a semantic point of view, a representation of mind as impenetrable rather than readable is characteristic, with a preference for the neutral cf&gt;pf|v, more liable to adjectival qualification, rather than for connotatively rich elements, such as 0upóç. Finally, verbs, adjectives, verbal repetitions and imagery as personal, subjective, non-monologic means are preferred devices in the description of madness in the play. Thus, we can claim that Pentheus' madness is remarkably internalized. Such internal- ization happens within definable Greek psychological parameters, namely causative divine intervention, hallucination, and punishment. As external madness calls for a stable cosmos to refer to, or depart from, so internalized madness, via the Greek modality of a continuity between man and world, damages the system of the world and the very meaning of human madness therein.146 There is no constructive solution in Bacchae. The final motivation of the god is empty and self-serving, and the world, where it is not the projection of a deranged mind, is reduced to a source of escapism, an element of play and decoration. 2.2 Disease and cure The second domain with a special capacity to illuminate the relationship between human and divine is sickness and health as function of the god's intervention in the affairs of man. The treatment of this motif in the play inevitably falls within the scope of the representation of self and world, while the norm of sanity is identifiable with 'the encounter between a healthy man and the world',147 and madness/disease, conversely, is the 'failure to recognize the world', ' méconaissance du monde'm Accordingly, points made earlier in the chapter about the representations of psychological process and the view of the cosmos will receive their due corroboration here. The motif of sickness and warning to their victims: that he should be careful not to destroy the seats of the nymphs and Pan in the case of Pentheus ( Ba . 951-52), and that the Greek winners should respect the gods for Agamemnon 04#. 338-40). In both passages the rare term lôpupaTa ('shrines') occurs, which may suggest that Euripides had the Aeschylean scene in mind. This parallel underlines the difference between the two situations. Agamemnon is unaware of the attack that will be carried out against him, while Pentheus' ignorance is a much more complex and deeper matter than ignoring a piece of information. 145 Chapter I, p. 23. 146 In McDonald's words, at the end of the play Dionysus has eliminated 'non seulement des êtres humains, mais l'humanité elle-même' (McDonald 1992, 233). 147 Pigeaud (1987) 45 (my translation, here and below). 148 Pigeaud (1987) 46.</page><page sequence="96">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 87 health, as well as the motif of tying/freeing (which we shall consider later), prompts observations akin to those we formulated in connection with mania ; in fact, the two concepts - disease and mania - cannot be legitimately separated when considering the works of classical antiquity. In the popular view presented in poetic literature up to tragedy, as well as in the Hippocratic treatises, the two ideas overlap: mania is the serious disease par excellence , and any disease is liable to be accompanied by mania. Compared to the other tragic examples, Pentheus' derangement and sickness is highly personalized and idiosyncratic, as is that of Agave, rather than simply the action over man of an external force. The new treatment of character and the new perceptions of disease can be considered evidence of a similar development in the view of man: the exceptional, the particular, and the daily begin to be considered alongside the normative and the average. 2.2.7 Bacchae, Thucydides and the Corpus Hippocraticum In Bacchae the foreign god's arrival is repeatedly presented as disease for the individual and epidemic inside the community. I propose to analyse both the usage of technical 'medical' terms, or keywords referring to the medical domain, and the description of states of emergency in the tragedy. A comparison with two sorts of texts will be found helpful. On a more theoretical level, I shall make use of the Corpus Hippocraticum and the medical tradition available to Euripides.149 On a verbal and factual level, I shall consider the historical experience of the plague which hit Athens in 430 BC as described by Thucydides. I shall then turn to a few examples of diseased individuals from tragedy (Ajax, Heracles, Orestes , and especially Philoctetes). The first two sources, CH and Thucydides, are valuable in two different senses. Hippocratic literature should not be regarded as a testimony separated from literary sources by some fundamental difference in its nature. As Pigeaud rightly puts it, 'Hippocrates |&gt;c. the anonymous author/s of the earlier Hippocratic treatises] is an artist. Stylistic aspects of his writing carry a literary value, and at the same time a technical-medical meaning. ...the doctor observes the ill person and decides, among the many phenomena which affect him, the ones which seem meaningful to him. ... Therefore a Hippocratic doctor must also be a philologist'.150 The medical descriptions in the Corpus , therefore, have to be treated in the same way as we treat more widely acknowledged literary works, like tragedy, as significant evidence for the reconstruction of the view of man.151 There is no need to contrast a view of disease as caused by divine intervention, as in the examples from tragedy that we shall present, with the 'rationalist' Hippocratic analysis of causes and symptoms: both perspectives reflect the quest to determine what affects human life. Hippocratic texts present new perceptions of human beings which can be usefully compared with the depictions of mental processes in Bacchae. On the other side, Thucydides' account of the epidemic in Athens gives us an idea of the actual perception of an attested disease within the community and of the representation of the sick from the intelligent observer's point of view. 149 On Euripides' knowledge of Hippocratic treatises and medical references in his work see Craik (2001). 150 Pigeaud (1987) 20-21. 151 Cf. Pigeaud (1987) 20: 'there are vacuums in the phenomenological description: not all that happens is registered... Hippocrates uses brachylogy and parataxis'.</page><page sequence="97">88 HIDDEN PATHS This is not the place for a systematic account of the positions expressed in the Corpus in all their variety and detail. Nevertheless, it is useful to note an evolution of ideas there, which can be compared to the portrait of man in our play.152 First, the concept of disease itself evolves in the fifth century. Disease is not conceived any longer as a monolithic phenomenon that diverse people undergo in a fixed, pre-determined way. A role is acknowledged for idiosyncratic differences from person to person as focal for the development and outcome of a given disease.153 That concept of development, meanwhile, represents another new feature opposed to the rigid view of disease as external affliction with fixed characteristics, and one that offers an analogy with the character development that we noted in the depiction of Pentheus as opposed to that of other tragic figures.154 Quoting an example from Prognostic , Pigeaud has summarized this novelty in the Hippocratic approach thus: Prognostic III: 'to grind one's teeth in a fever: unless it has been a habit since childhood, (it implies) a state of madness and danger of death; and if mental derangement is added to this state, then it is really alarming'. This passage from Prognostic is interesting, because it implies the concept of ethos, habit, as a norm with which the doctor - who has gathered information from recollections, or by asking the patient's relatives - can compare the behaviour of the patient. The next comment is significant: The doctor will try to discover if there was any wound before the beginning of the disease ...'155 Here we can see a new appreciation of human idiosyncrasy and personal history.156 In more specific terms, one particular group of lexical elements in the Hippocratic de- scriptions of the outbreak of disease is relevant. Again and again, the Hippocratic authors suggest that a diseased person reacts as to being struck and cries out in pain;157 they also use the verb àXúco, related to àXdopai (T err', T wander'), to indicate the agitated anxiety of the sick.158 Both features (though not the verb itself) are common to the portrayal of frenzied people in Bacchae. Euripides' maenadism has been plausibly diagnosed as expression of collective feminine hysteria by 152 Cf. Di Benedetto (1986) 4-7. 153 To give one example, the 'sacred disease' affects by nature the phlegtnatics, never the bilious ( Morb . Sacr. II, 6.366.1-2): Pigeaud (1987) 53. 154 See Chapter II, pp. 64-65. 155 Pigeaud (1987) 31, quoting Prog. Ill, 2.120.9-122.3. 156 Moreover, Pigeaud (1987) 24 attributes to Hippocrates a conception of a 'constant within "natural behaviour", a "character", a personality rapidly sketched out, a regulating ethos which might help to measure the gravity of the symptom'. Hippocrates 'has discovered the patient as person [my emphasis]'. Cf. in Bacchae the acknowledgement of a 'stable, 'untouchable' constituent of one's individuality, evident, for instance, in Dionysus' argument at 314-18, whereby the women's morality is said to depend on their inner nature, rather than on external influences:... è v tt1 &lt;f&gt;íxj€ i 1 tò aüxf&gt;poi&gt;€Ív eveoriv eis* tò tt&amp;vt ' dei ('in their nature resides self-control with respect to everything'), 315-16. 316 is deleted by Kirchoff; see however Ferrari (1985) 43. 157 TTdpaKpowú, TTapáicpouapa ('I strike', 'a strike'), Epid.

Let us turn to Thucydides' Historiae. In the second book (2.47.3-54.5) Thucydides describes the plague which hit Athens in 430 BC; he emphasizes the novelty of the disease, which was unforeseen and which doctors were unable to handle (2.47.4, àyvoíq, 'without knowing' the nature of the disease); it was sudden and unpredictable (2.48.2, eg Ô6 tt'v 'AOrimiíov ttóXiv èÇamvaiGoç 6V6tt606, 'it suddenly fell upon the city'). The disease had previously struck elsewhere (Lemnos and other areas, 2.47.3), and had finally reached the city of Athens, starting as normal in a port, in this case Piraeus (2.48.2). The suspicion that an enemy - the Peloponnesians - might have poisoned the water (2.48.2, cf)áppaKa eaßeßXf)KOi€v èg rà Apeara) evinces a collective anxiety and need for a scapegoat in time of catastrophe. Thirst, burning heat and the helpless need for liquids are described by Thucydides as the main behavioural symptoms of the plague (2.49.5, 2.52.2- 3). Some would forget everything after the disease: Xf|0r| €Xap.ßav6...Kal riyvoqcrav G(f)âg re avrovg Kal touç emTriSeious'162: 'forgetfulness would catch them... they did not recognize themselves or their relatives'. The disease catches and conquers everyone without making any distinction, regardless of one's strength or condition (2.51.2-3, 2.51.4); finally, the social reaction is one of disengagement, hopelessness, and despairing hedonism; no longer mindful of personal merit or divine justice, the agonized Athenians would prefer to enjoy their riches as quickly as possible before unavoidable death: '...and so they resolved to get out of life the pleasures which could be had speedily and would satisfy their lusts, regarding their bodies and their wealth alike as transitory' (2.53.2). We can now turn to Euripides' text. A number of similarities are apparent between the medical view, the actual description of the epidemic in Thucydides, and the impact of Dionysus on Thebes as presented in our play. First of all, terms explicitly allusive of disease and cure are used in Bacchae as a metaphor for Dionysiac possession. Interestingly, all the expressions taken from the domain of health and disease are used both against and in defence of Dionysus, who is presented as healer and polluter, the sick one and the supernaturally untouchable one at the same time. (i) (ķappaKov ttóvcüv, 'remedy for sufferings' is an epithet for Dionysus' gift of wine at 283, and Pentheus' arrogant stubbornness is, in Tiresias' words, such that outé (1&gt;ap[iáK0iç I ctKT| Xdßois1 àv out' avev toútgov vôctéiç.163 I!W Dodds (1940); Dodds (1960) i-xxxviii; Musitelli (1968). 160 Ba. 148b. 161 Ba . 166; 866-67. ,ň2 Th. 2.49.8. 163 Ba. 326-27.

I do not find the passage unacceptable as it stands {pace Levy, 1972: I do not see the need for translating the second line as "for the lack [my emphasis] of them (medicines) you are ill'). We shall see how the</page><page sequence="99">90 HIDDEN PATHS (ii) vó(JOS' 'disease'164 vocréco, 'I am ill',165 and cíkoç, 'cure'166 are also used in the same application, either in Pentheus' mouth to castigate the new epidemic of madness, or against the king himself, whose resistance and rigidity is seen as a form of disease. (iii) The women's celebrations are unhealthy (oùx úyiéç), in Pentheus' opinion, because wine is involved;167 conversely, the god will praise the now possessed Pentheus, saying Tdç 8è TTpiv (f&gt;péuaç I ovk eîx^ç vyteïç, vvv 8 ' ex^iç oías* oe 8eî,168 'your previous mind was not healthy, but now you have the kind of mind that you should have'. The concept of sanity is a double-edged weapon in our play. Like the adjective &lt;jo&lt;póç,169 it is a concept used by the different characters from different perspectives, so that it is finally deprived of any stable, objective meaning. Other, less specific, items of vocabulary work in the same direction.170 The idea of a spreader of plague damaging the community from within, which was quoted in Thucydides, is detectable in the perception that Pentheus has of the stranger, as a yór|ç 6tto)8ós' 'sorcerer, enchanter'.171 This term, besides its specification of a 'casuist, trickster', also connotes 'healing by charms'.172 Dionysus appears therefore as both a sort of polluter of the community and as healer of it.173 The trip the god made before reaching concept of sanity is personal and relativized in the play, in comparison with other tragic depictions; in this light, I do not find it ill-fitting that Tiresias should claim that Pentheus' main problem and weakness is perhaps what the king himself sees as his point of strength, namely his inflexibility. There is no need to interpret ^dppaxa literally as a drug that Pentheus is accused of having taken: it is best to maintain the web of allusions involving the concept of wine as 4&gt;dppai&lt;ov, the use of disease as figure for a distorted view of reality, and the accusations against Dionysus of being a polluter. In these words Tiresias is hinting at the ambiguity and relativity of values such as 'sanity*, and at the need for compromise. Cf. PV 473-75 for a similar play on disease and cure vis-à-vis Prometheus (kcucòs* l&lt;rrpòç...èç vòoov ' Treawv, 'some inferior doctor who's become ill'). 164 Ba. 353. 165 Ba. 311,327. 166 Ba. 327. 167 Ba. 262. 168 Ba. 947-48. 169 See pp. 76-77. 170 Craik (2001) rightly highlights the problems of trying to assess tragic allusion to medicine. These include 'how close must similarities in language and thought be to be considered really significant', and 'the twin problems of technical and metaphorical language', whereby technical is a 'weasel word, as technicality is relative to the user'. In this way, for example, the verb Trawo/nauopai (and cognate àTTOTTaúopai), 'I make to cease'/' I cease' is a common verb, but it can have a technical acceptation in the medical sense of 'making pain- sickness cease', 'heal', according to Van Brock (1961) 208-1 1. It is used twice by Pentheus in his threats against the stranger and the women, firstly when he says '1 will put an end to their pernicious Bacchic revelry ...' (232) and secondly when he vows to 'stop him beating his thyrsus and tossing his hair ...' (240). It is later used by the Asian Maenads with reference to wine's healing power to stop worries and sorrow (38 1 ). 171 Ba. 234. 172 fnaoi8f| thus at Od. XIX, 457, P. P. 3.51, A. Eum. 649, S. Aj. 582, PI. Rep. 426 b 1 . 173 So too, conversely, does Pentheus, as in 962-63, when he claims: póvos* yàp aîrrûv dp. ' àvf|p ToXpwv TÓÔ6 ('I am the only man of them to dare this deed') and the god ironically agrees, póvos* où TToXfojs* Trjcrô ' irrrcpKápveis-, povos- ('alone you are toiling for this city, alone'). The theme of the polluting presence to be expelled with relation to an epidemic is, of course, traditional. See, for example, Sophocles' OT 95-150. In Bacchae this theme offers a further example of relativization obtained through the repeated application of the concept to different characters. Dionysus is treated as a polluter from the outside by Pentheus; Pentheus himself</page><page sequence="100">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 9 1 Thebes and the trieteric, cyclic character of this mythological arrival represent another feature we can superimpose over the idea of epidemic disease (with the two connected as if by an implicit pun on èmôruila, both 'epidemic' and 'arrival among the people').174 Thucydides' account of the plague as overwhelming force which penetrates the community from the outside (2.48.2) may likewise be compared with the arrival of a god which causes mass reaction, mass worship and mass chaos; and the collective scenes of mob-frenzy in Thebes certainly recall the historian's account of social dislocation in plague-stricken Athens. One might also compare the plague that assails the Achaeans in Iliad I (43-56). Homer's equation of random disease with the flying arrows of an angry god presents an archetypal enactment of the Greek belief in a supernatural causation for epidemics. In our discussion of the Hippocratic view of disease and symptoms we noted the association between sickness and being struck and crying out.175 More generally, a sudden change in one's state is seen as a typical manifestation of disease, and, in particular, the alternation from a state of quietness and tranquillity to one of crisis, anxiety or suffering is acknowledged as typical of sickness.176 These medical conditions easily find a correspondence with the descriptions of the god's influence in Bacchae.111 The actions of running, dancing, and leaping characterize the Maenads' jerky motions, while the terms olorpoç ('sting') and KévTpov ('goad'), which symbolize the power of the god urging on his thiasos , are used to represent the sudden onset of divine frenzy.178 The irregularities of maenadic dance reflect this explosive onset as well, summed up, as they are, by the word aKipTT)pa ('leap')179 and by evocations of 'tossing one's throat to the dewy air of « aã I Q 1 1 QO heaven', 'storm-swift with fast-running efforts', 'hurling to the ground', throwing at a target,183 hitting the earth with the thyrsus.184 The movements of the Maenads are ends up killed by a mob, as the victim of a collective persecution, a scapegoat (see Girard 1986, 1-23 and passim). In Chr.Pat. 1756 we also read: 8ei yáp ae tt)v fovůkrav €kXltt€Īv ttóXiv ('for it is necessary that she, the murderer, should leave the city'). The line is perhaps attributable to Dionysus, speaking to Agave at the end of the lacuna after Ba. 1329; Agave must leave Thebes because she contaminates the city, having murdered her son; moreover, she will refer to the seat of the Bacchic rites outside the city, the Mount Cithaeron, as polluted: KiOaipùv ... piapo? (1384). Cf. also Chr. Pat. 1674-75: XiTT€Îi&gt; TTÓXiv tt|v8 ' àvoaíou inda^ajos1 ÒÌKa? TivovTas* ... '[they should] leave this city, and atone for this unholy pollution 174 Cf.

Their 'wanderings', likewise, recall the agitated unease of the sick, as presented in the Hippocratic writings.185 In our play the image of wandering is used repeatedly to convey an idea of possession and liberation at the same time. The Maenads define themselves as the TrXavdTaç,186 the wanderers; their associations with wild animals are referable to the same notion. A relevant aspect of the experience of a community hit by an epidemic is the undif- ferentiated nature of the external influence: the god is 8iapi0pcov...oü8év ' ,187 'not disting- uishing' between one man and another when he claims his due worship.188 We have seen this impartial, egalitarian quality of plague in the community in Thucydides' words (2.51.3). Thucydides provides a further parallel: the escapist appreciation of the present good that motivates the chorus in Bacchae recalls the hopeless hedonism of the plague community, responding to its desperate situations.189 One more psychological observation is common to Euripides' and Thucydides' accounts. We have quoted the historian's mention of the way amnesia sometimes affected the victims after healing ('they could not recognize themselves or their relatives', qyvoqaav a&lt;pâç re avrovç Kai touç érnTr^eiousO.190 A profound manipulation of the idea of 'knowing oneself or, even more, 'recognizing one's relatives' is present in Bacchae. The way in which the play deals with familial relationships will be considered in detail in Chapter III.3; for now, we can cite: Pentheus' general failure to recognize the god as his relative and, in his fanatical Olympian orthodoxy,191 to acknowledge the chthonic nature of his father Echion;192 the Theban women's failure to recognize Zeus' union with Semeie; Agave's failure to recognize her son; and, not least, the overwhelming presence of the motif of 'ignorance of oneself. This applies mainly to the two characters Agave and Pentheus. As Dionysus remarks to the king: OÙK oio0' ötl Cti?» ovó ' õ ópâç ovó ' óoTiç el ('you do not know what your life is, nor what you are doing, nor who you are').193 184 Ba. 704. 185 The image of the mad or ill person 'wandering' is common in Greek literature elsewhere: Herschkowitz (1998) 125. 186 Ba. 148b. 187 Ba. 209. 188 For the theme of equality in Dionysism, see Musurillo (1966) 303. 189 See 2.53.2; Ba. 9 1 Ob- 1 1 . 190 2.49.8. 191 See Ba. 467. 192 Even if references to Pentheus' ancestry are strikingly frequent in the play (Dodds 1960, 144); cf. 265; 537- 41 .

The terms TTUp (Tire') and &lt;1&gt;Xó£ ('flame') describe the women's frenzy. In Pentheus' words at 778-79: fļ8r| tó8 ' èyyvç üore rrüp v^àiîTerai I ußpiap.a ßaKxüv, 'already this insolent violence of the Bacchants is blazing up close like a fire'. cJ&gt;Xo£ is carried in torches at 145-46; it suddenly appears in the divine lightning: Trup at 3, 8, 288, 523, 1083; &lt;J&gt;Xo£ at 8, 598. TTup burns in the holy perennial pyre on the site of Semele's death, at 596 and 624. TTÜp surrounds the Maenads' head with miraculous flames, in the messenger's description, at 758. And in the Corpus Hippocraticum , as elsewhere,194 TTÖp is an established equivalent for TrupeTÓç, 'fever': thus Epid. I, 2.684.13, TTÜp 6Xaß£v, 'he was caught by a fever'195 or likewise Morb. I, 6.146.7, pi-voç rjv XaßT], TTup ¿mXaßeiv, 'if he catches cold, he would develop a fever'.196 I am not proposing a one-sided reading of the play which implies a condemnation of Dionysism by the poet and its identification with a negative mob-phenomenon which contaminates the community of citizens.197 What I am arguing is that consideration of the recent traumatic experience of the plague, as well as the important turning point represented by Hippocratic medicine, may help us reconstruct the implications of a play like Bacchae in its socio-historical and linguistic-historical context. As noted earlier, a comparison with the medical tradition serves to place Bacchae 's presentation of humanity within the worldview of its time. Even though, at a popular level, much of the superstition surrounding illness was certainly retained, a new awareness of the specificity of disease, along with an interest in symptoms and pathology, runs parallel to the development of the depiction of man towards idiosyncratic detail on the one hand and a more introverted view of the psyche on the other. A corollary is a new challenge to the belief that disease affects and takes over the most intimate human structure, substantially modifying the nature of a person, and its analogue in the Greek view of mental process: the porous, open and observable innerness of the pre-tragic portrayal of man, whereby the individual is affected by emotions and mental states as if 'from the outside' begins to be replaced by a more impenetrable and unreadable depiction of the human psyche. 2.2.2 Earlier examples of tragic disease and madness By way of confirming the novelty of Bacchae , we may usefully compare, and contrast, a few other tragic treatments of disease: first of all, Sophocles' Philoctetes ; secondly Orestes , Heracles and Ajax. In these cases we deal with the representation of individual sickness, rather than epidemic as collective experience. 194 E.g. Pi. P. 3.50. In Soph. OT the diffusion of the plague is described as the action of ò TTup&lt;|&gt;ópo? 060?, 'the fever-god' (27). 195 Cf. also Epid. I, 2.690.15; 2.694. 13. 196 Cf. also Morb. I, 6.154.1. 197 On the links between Dionysism and the idea of mass-disease, see Kerenyi (1992) 91, 139, 142, 182; Dodds (1960) 1 14 on 343-44: 'Pentheus speaks of Bacchism as if it were a physical infection transmissible by contact (as all forms of pollution were long held to be)'. Against this connection see Henrichs (1982) 146; 222 n. 82. I might add here that more recent criticisms of the notion of 'Dionysism' (as against 'Dionysus' himself) by e.g. Henrichs (1993) do not affect my argument.</page><page sequence="103">94 HIDDEN PATHS In Philoctetes we have the only extant tragic representation of a diseased character as completely separated from an idea of madness; the hero's disease is caused by a terrible wound due to a snake-bite. The violence of his attacks and the disgusting exhalations from his leg make his companions decide to leave him on the island of Lemnos. Philoctetes' disease, then, is not directly due to supernatural causes, and the depiction of his desolation and rejection is for a modern sensibility one of the highest peaks of sympathetic humanity reached by tragedy. Notwithstanding the psychological complexity of his portrayal as a sick man, in Philoctetes we can see a representation of the disease as completely externalized, dealt with by the subject (who is deeply aware of the situation and available to talk about it in detail) almost as if the disease itself were an interlocutor. At 649 he says: ývWov ti poi TīdpecjTiv, Ji [lák igt ' dei I Koipco tóô ' éXkoç, cIìoté TTpaüVeiv návv, 'there is a certain herb. It's what I use all the time to soothe the disease; it brings special relief'. The disease is almost personalized as a being that the victim needs to tame and keep under control. At 742-43 he calls it kczkóv, 'an evil', 'a distress', once again presenting it as an agent opposed to himself, Koù 8uvf|aopai kcxkòv I Kpú^ai Trap ' vļilv, arraTaî;, '...I shall not be able to hide my distress from you. . .' and at 820 he says: to yap KaKÒv to8 ' 0ÙK6T ' òp0oDa0aL p ' éa, 'this evil no longer lets me stay upright'. Again, at 1 188-89 he exclaims: co ttoúç, ttoúç, tl g ' er ' è v ßico | téu£co tco peTÓmv, TaXaç; ('o my foot, my foot! What will I do with you, in the wretched life that lies before us?'). At 1377 he mentions his injured foot again, tûô€ StKJTiļVip ttoSi ('with my foot afflicted like this'). At 1207-09 he gives expression to his desperation again by putting distance between himself and his tormented body: 'I want to sever my head from my limbs with this hand: my purpose now is to kill, to kill', KpäTa Kai äp0p ' àiTÒ TravTa Tépco xePL'l &lt; povâ &lt;1&gt;ovq vòoç r'Sr'. Finally, at 747-48 we have another distancing presentation of the suffering bodily part, 'by the gods, child, if you have a sword to hand, strike at my foot. Cut it off, quick as you can'. Neoptolemus also describes the disease as Seivóv ye Toùmaaypa tou voaripaToç, 'a terrible burden of sickness',198 in sympathy with Philoctetes. All in all, the disease is externalized in the same way by the diseased Philoctetes, and his interlocutor, Neoptolemus. Philoctetes is aware of his condition: at line 473-74 he claims bitterly about himself: 8ucrxépeia M-év, I e£oi8a, ttoXXt] Tou8e tou &lt;J&gt;opf|paToç, 'I know it's no easy matter to have something like me on board'. He also foresees the loss of consciousness that follows the attacks, and begs Neoptolemus to guard his spears and arrows from his enemies while he is asleep.199 From the point of view of awareness, the mania in Orestes is more akin to Philoctetes' crises than to those of Pentheus, which amount to a prolonged and continuous distorted state. The point at stake here is not simply internalization (Orestes' aúveaiç, Pentheus' co-operation with his own destruction) versus externalization (Philoctetes directly addres- sing his kokou). We shall see how, for Orestes, the mental phenomenon is more complex and is presented as both a hallucinatory experience and a presence, akin to the model in 198 Ph. 755. 199 Ph. 766-73.</page><page sequence="104">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 95 the Aeschylean Choephori , which is then followed by Heracles.200 1 would say that here it is rather a matter of self-awareness and objectification, the latter meaning awareness on the part of all relevant characters of what is happening. Externalization in Philoctetes is combined with self-awareness on the part of the subject, as it is, sooner or later, in Ajax (attacked by Athena) and Heracles (attacked by Lyssa). In all these cases, too, mental phenomena or physical states are open to observation by the subjects' interlocutors and by the audience. Truly, there can also be self-awareness through internalization - which the modern novel so often deploys - towards which Euripides' Orestes represents a step: in Bacchae we have, as we have argued, internalization through unawareness. It may be useful to offer a more schematic classification of the five plays and of the characters affected by madness in them, to avoid any confusion about my usage of such terms as 'internalization', 'self-awareness' and 'subjectification': • Externalization or internalization: is madness or disease presented as an external entity, or does the victim conceive of it as a part of his or her innerness or body? • Self-awareness or unawareness: is the subject aware of his or her mental or physical state of health? • Objectification or subjectification: to what extent does the subject communicate and share his or her awareness or perspective with the other characters?

Let us briefly sketch out our contrasting examples. In Orestes the madman greets the end of a crisis with an acknowledgement: ¿0 (1&gt;lXov irnvou ôéXyriTpov, 6TTÍKOupov vócjou, lúç f|8u (loi TTpocrrjX06Ç èv ôéovTi re ... O friendly enchantment of sleep, help against sickness, how sweet was your coming, just when I needed it.202 The subject, once again, is aware of unawareness, and invokes iràrvia Afj0r|,203 'mistress oblivion of Ills', as remedy for those who suffer. Orestes also describes the feeling of relief and exhaustion at the end of an attack, at 227-28: ÖTav ai/fļ vóaoç I |iaviáç, ávapôpóç el|ii Kaaöevco piXri ('when the madness abates, I am limbless, I have no strength in my body'). Like Philoctetes, he is also aware of the difficult temper of sick people: ôuaápcaTov oi voaowTeç àTroplaç ütto, 'there is no pleasing the sick in their helplessness' (232). At 396-97 the aweaiç previously commented on is problematized and seen as a source of anguish, not of clarity as Menelaus would expect, when he answers: 'how do you mean? It is intelligent to be clear (tò oafyéç), not to be obscure, (to ļj-fļ aa&lt;f&gt;£ç)!'.204 Finally, at 791 Orestes fears that the terrible goddesses may come back to him. In Ajax , the staging of the hero's awakening (previously described at 31 1-22: Tecmessa recounts how Ajax has forced her to reveal him what he has done, and then breaks into lamentations) begins at 333; this is sudden, and he is conscious of the actions he has committed from the very beginning. He is heard onstage weeping (lei 'ioi p.oi, at 333 and 336) and then he appeals to his son and to his sailors, while the actual process of gaining knowledge of his past derangement is left completely implicit. At 343 he says éyoj 8 ' àiTÓXXup.ai; 'will I perish?', showing a reflective awareness of his condition. At 384, 202 Or. 211-12. 203 Or. 213. 204 In fact, Orestes displays two tendencies. One of these internalizes and subjectifies the character's view of his disease, when Orestes deals with Electra, who does not share her brother's visions and regards them as hallucinations (314-15). The other tendency is objectifying and externalizing, when Orestes faces Menelaus (409-13), who recognizes the three Erinyes as an actual presence; at 409, referring to the three goddesses, he says, ol8 ' àç èXéÇaç, òvopdaai 8 ' où ßouXopat, 'I know the ones you mean. I don't care to name them' (and does not, pace Barlow 1971, 126, 'take Electra's less traditional line' in interpreting Orestes' visions as a product of the sick man's mind). Menelaus reacts with amazement to Orestes' claim that his pain is caused by aúveai9 ('intellect', 'awareness', at 396), because 'aúveaLç' in his view should be a source of clarity, not of confusion. Menelaus is still moving within an externalizing model, according to which three goddesses are possessing Orestes: to be aware of this fact is for Menelaus terrifying but also healthy. Orestes, by contrast, is speaking within an internalizing model, so that avisais is for him a most problematic concept and, far from being a cure, it is perhaps his main source of evil. It is, therefore, clear that awareness is a difficult concept to handle, because its borders depend on the very concept of self held by the subject discussed. Compare Hamlet 1 84-86, where the line between two levels is sharply drown: the prince, just before his father's ghost's previous appearances are revealed to him, says to Horatio: 'My father, methinks I see my father' 'Where, my lord?' 'In my mind's eye, Horatio' (on the interpretation of aúveaiç in Orestes see Assael (1996), 62-64; 68-69, who defines the opposition between aùvecriç and paivopai as that of the two poles of human intelligence, where aúveaiç is a concept of 'sympathetic, com-prehensive understanding' as opposed to a 'cerebral mechanism').</page><page sequence="106">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 97 he says ï8oipi 8f| viv, KaiTTep &lt;Sô ' (mūļievos1, T wish I could see him, even in this state of ruin' once more showing a lucid view of the facts. The whole passage from 379 onwards is full of admissions and self-considerations on Ajax's part.205 Heracles offers a sudden and abrupt return of the deranged hero to a condition of mental sanity, at 1089-90: ea • I epTTVovs* piv ei[ii Kai SéSopx ' aiTep [ie bel, I aiGepa re Kai yfļv ró£a 0' fļXiou TáSe, 'Ah!

A detailed description of the bodily and psychological symptoms of a change follows, even though Heracles will not remember suffering any delirium:206 T was swamped somehow by a terrible confusion of mind (4&gt;pevcov) and my breath (ttvoóç) comes hot and unsteady from my lungs (ttXéupóvgov), not steady at all' (1091-93). However, a few words from his father tell him what has happened, and it is a short step to finally framing the whole situation. In Philoctetes the crisis of the hero is presented like a sudden attack {e.g., at 732-805), as if from a beast rushing at the sick man and biting him (ßpi&gt;xop.ai, 745). Philoctetes faints and falls into a disturbed torpor, which the chorus describes, at 848, as an eù8paKT]ç I ûttvoç âvTTvoç Xeúaaeiv, 'the sleep of sickness, no sleep, keen-sighted in everyone...'. Once he has woken up, the hero exclaims, co (f&gt;éyyoç öttvou 8id8oxov...,'0 light after sleep...!' (867), emphasizing his consciousness of the alternating phases of suffering and loss of sense that constitute his disease. At 1101-02 the crisis is again upon him, co TXaptov TXdp.cov ap ' èyœ I Kai [loxGco XcoßaTÖ?, 'Misery! Misery! Broken by suffering'. At 1 1 87, he has another attack: àiTÓXcoX ' ó TaXaç, 'I am ruined, wretched'. In short, these sequences have in common the abrupt, sudden character of the attacks and the subject's awareness of them. This is true in varying degrees, of course: total awareness for Orestes and Philoctetes, compared with awareness only once the attack is concluded for Ajax and Heracles. With the last two, the support of another person, Tecmessa or Amphitryon, is necessary to offer a link to the external world and to bring the victim back to reality, while the first two have a proper perception of their derange- ment and crises of their own. While for the first two heroes (Ajax and Heracles) shame is the leading motif in their awakening, Orestes and Philoctetes offer a deeper human description of the humiliation of being weak and ill, independent of the judgement of others. Nevertheless, Heracles and Ajax also reach a full awareness of their position, and act (as a consequence) along the lines of a cogitated choice. In Agave's famous 'psychotherapy scene' (Ba. 1259-329), which has prompted modern amazement at its affinities with modern psychotherapeutic techniques,207 we find 2()S Orestes' awareness is different from, say, Ajax's realization of his deranged actions. In Ajax's words to his son it is explicit that awareness is painful as well: 'yet even now I can envy you, at least I that you have no perception of these troubles I For the most pleasant life consists in being aware of nothing I before you learn the meaning of pleasure and pain' (552-55). However, for Ajax the painful side of awareness is mainly shame for the misplaced and humiliating deed he regrets, while Orestes believes he has done a right thing and truly had no choice whatsoever; his aweaiç is not mere 'awareness of facts', as for Ajax, but a deeper and disturbing insight into a man's own psyche. 206 See HF 1 122, où yap ti (kncxeúaaç yf pépiripai 4&gt;pe vaç, 'I have no recollection of being mad'. 207 See Devereux (1970). Di Benedetto (2004, 153) rightly notes the originality in the representation of Agave's madness and recovery: 'the initial phase [derangement and Pentheus' killing] is hugely longer [than the attacks of madness in H F and Orestes],... the model of questioning the individual so that he or she may recover his or</page><page sequence="107">98 HIDDEN PATHS a representation of the psyche quite different both from those of Orestes and Philoctetes (they are aware of the periodic rhythm of their disease throughout their crisis and healings; their derangement is not acted through in a single mad action, set apart from the person's normal behaviour) and from those of Ajax and Heracles (whose disease or mad- ness is embodied in a particular action). First, Agave's deranged act as a mad woman completely contravenes the behaviour we might expect of her character. While Ajax's and Heracles' actions were, in themselves, more misplaced than mad - for two heroes it is more than natural to fight and kill - Agave's deviation is, really, an upsetting of her identity. A much slower process of healing from mental derangement is required, involving the resistance of the woman to admitting the unbearable truth to herself.208 Cadmus leads Agave through an excruciating sequence of questions aimed at letting her gradually remember her true identity as Pentheus' mother, so as to make her recognize the deed she has committed on the mountains as a hunter. Her distorted perception of reality, her partial amnesia (1272) and her hysterical foolishness are part of this process of recovering from mania . Comparing her portrayal to those of Heracles or Ajax, we find her awakening much more complex and articulated, whereas theirs are as abrupt and sudden as the epiphanic interventions which caused them - and in Bacchae , the intervention is not even staged. Agave's manic exaltation, therefore, possesses her personality at multiple levels, even if (as we still insist) her main mad action is independent of her expected personality much more then with the two earlier heroes: to hunt on the mountain is a completely unexpected, contradictory action for a woman. In her ill-judged boldness, Agave asks for her father Cadmus and her son Pentheus, wishing they were there to see her booty (1 195-96; 121 1-12); she cheerfully blames the 'bad-tempered old age' of her father (1251), who cannot sympathize with her enthusiasm; she is proud of having battled against a 'lion', though a woman, 'with the fingers of white hands' (1203-07). Her derangement is unexpected, but integrated within her personality through everyday detail and personal idiosyncrasies.209 From line 1263 to 1280 we watch the slow process of Agave's healing: Cadmus makes her look at the sky (1264-67) and focus on her familial identity - her husband, father and son. Devereux calls this 'resocialization' involving 'regression' (the father-figure is the easiest to recognize).210 Reference to 'the sky' and 'the sun-light' is indeed a 'Greek cultural lever',211 and we also find it in Heracles , at 1089-90, at the beginning of the hero's awakening from madness. This mention of natural elements reflects the usage of her senses and awareness of his or her identity... is not comparable with other known tragic texts, but with the Socratic model; it is a questioning that has a maieutic finality' (my translation). 208 See Devereux (1970) 37. 209 These belong to her staged behaviour after the hunt (during the hunt she is described by the messenger as violent and merciless), which take to the extreme the expression of exultation and joy in the flush of success in hunting which might be expected for a young male character. They include foolish boldness, at 1 193: 'Do you praise me?'; a boasting tendency at 1214-15, as she wants her 'prize' to be nailed to the triglyphs of the house; a taste for winning and being first, at 1235: 'all of them [her fellow-hunters], but especially me ' (see also 1 179; 1 182); the desire to be praised by the 'men of the family', Cadmus and Pentheus; and in general a vain and somehow childish manipulative attitude, characterized by boasts and hyperboles. 210 See Devereux (1970) 42. 211 See Devereux (1970)41.</page><page sequence="108">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 99 the world as 'source of sanity' that we discussed earlier.212 In this instance, however, a positive world-order is not restored. The vision of sunlight is partly Cadmus' strategy to heal his daughter, and partly conventional: only after looking back at the ttpóctgúttov ('head'/'face') in her hand (1280), and only after focusing on her familial life, slowly led by Cadmus' empathie and personalized strategy to win over her resistance, will Agave fully understand. Maybe most naturalistically for a modern audience, Agave does not finally reach a situation of active, healthy awareness, however painful, but is confined to a helpless silence: she wishes she could remain in a condition of unawareness, where 1J.T1T6 Ki0aipd)v £[i' 'í8oi [iiapòç 1385 fjLT|T6 Ki0aipûv' öaaoiaiv èytò, pr|ô' ö0l 0úpaou p-idļļi' àvciKÉiTai213 neither polluted Cithaeron might see me nor I may see Cithaeron with my eyes nor yet where there is memory of a thyrus.214 Her recovery from her earlier mania integrates her past within her future; we could (if we wished) imagine the subsequent painful life of Agave. In Bacchae there is an avoidance of the easier depiction of the feelings of shame and humiliation and, ultimately, of the final 212 Chapter I, pp. 13-14. 213 At 1384 there is a lacuna between KiOaipúv and piapós1. €p ' i8oi is Kirchoffs conjecture. 214 Ba. 1384-86. Unfortunately, the lacunae after 1300 and 1329 do not allow us to analyse Agave's next set of reactions. As far as the first is concerned, 'three lines would seem to be the minimum required for a natural transition to 1301' (Dodds 1960, 232; see also 234). Robert (1899, 645ff.) argued that 1300 must lead up to the scene of compositio membrorum (likewise Segal, 1999-2000) while Dodds puts it instead after 1329, in the second lacuna, where 'there is a gap of at least 50 lines', before Dionysus' appearance and speech (1960, 234); Dodds' view was supported by Di Benedetto (2004 162-64, 476-77), for whom the first lacuna must have been of only one verse. Leinieks (1967) supports Robert's view (also retained by Willink 1966), conjecturing the presence of two large lacunae, instead of a very short and a very large one. In Leinieks' view, the first would contain the compositio membrorum , and the second mainly Dionysus' speech, a view supported by Seaford (2001) 249-50; 252-53. Wilamowitz suggested the presence of a displacement in the first passage, whereby 1301 originally followed 1297, and 1298-300 stood inside the larger lacuna after 1329. However, as Dodds remarks, Cadmus' praise of the dead Pentheus is much more effective with the bier having already been brought forward. As far as the content of these passages is concerned, it was known to the rhetorician Apsines (third century AD), and it is re-elaborated in the Christus Patiens. From these sources we can reconstruct, first of all, a scene of despair, where Agave plays a central role; she mourns over her son's body limb by limb, conscious of being a polluted creature. As far as the nature of this scene is concerned, Di Benedetto (2004, 160-64) proposes instead, with Willink, that Apsines' testimony has been misinterpreted, and the scene included only the restitution of Pentheus' head to the body. Secondly, Dionysus appears on the OeoXoyfîoy, addresses all the Thebans, blames their refusal to honour him as a god and predicts the future for each survivor. Cadmus' offspring will be expelled from the city: Agave and her sisters are condemned to immediate exile as polluting murderers, while Cadmus and Harmonia will suffer the fate described from line 1330. Aside of these speculations, even if we allow for the missing lines (in which, according to Seaford 2001, 253 Dionysus 'surely announced the establishment of his cults in Thebes'), and for the 'essential values of human society in the face of suffering and death' that Agave's mourning ultimately reaffirms (Easterling 1987, 16), the ending of the play does not seem to offer any kind of redemption for Pentheus' mother, but only a passive desire for self-annihilation. The 'apologia' of the god at 1 349, that Zeus had ordained these things long ago, 'worsens the situation and seems to pass on mankind a long sentence of death and absurdity... here, indeed, we stand at the blind eye of the hurricane of pure tragedy, here at the self-destructive climax of the most profound, the most incommensurable, of Greek tragic texts' (Steiner 1996, 539).</page><page sequence="109">100 HIDDEN PATHS opposite choices taken, one of intransigence (Ajax) or one of human moderation (Heracles), which somehow seal the story at a point in time;215 what Agave now wishes for is not an exceptional deed or a human redemption, but only forgetful ness. 2.3 Tying/freeing The motif of tying/freeing in Bacchae confirms our claims about Pentheus' lack of aware- ness of his own mental state and his own position in the unfolding events. Imprisonment, binding and liberation are a characterizing mechanism in the play, and a central ex- perience in the plot as Dionysus' action in Thebes is in many ways an attempt to 'release', and Pentheus' resistance is an urge to restrain and control, both himself and others. The differences in kind between this third motif and the first two, mania and disease, will be apparent. These last two are motifs developed not only through imagery, but also through direct verbal references which make them explicitly available to the audience as problematic issues. The verbal instances connected to the concepts of mania and disease are given an overt, foregrounded importance. This does not happen with the motif of tying/freeing. The verbal instantiations of this motif are not problematized and do not directly provoke the audience or reader to deeper reflection, as do lines like 'what is wisdom?' (877/897), or 'you are mad most sorely, and neither are you curable with drugs, nor has your sickness come upon you without them' (326-27). At first sight, the tying/freeing is simply a datum literally described, or staged. At a deeper level (political or psychological), however, we perceive that this image, besides its concrete meaning(s), evokes the liberation and constriction of man. This perception is referable both to the traditional character of Dionysus as 'Lysios',216 and to the development of the drama. This deeper sphere, however, is never presented explicitly: it is part of the facts which the characters live without being aware of it. Let us, accordingly, focus on the mode by which the tying/freeing imagery is conveyed in the play as significant for the depiction of the characters.217 The keywords used in the play are ôéapios- ('binding', 'captive'), Ôeapóç ('bond'), delv ('to bind') and 'veiv ('to free'), ctpKuç ('net'), elpKTfļ ('prison'). (i) The adjective ôcapioç ('binding') is used by Pentheus against Tiresias at 259: 'if your white-haired old age was not there to save you, you would be sitting tied up (ôéopioç) in the midst of the Maenads'. The king had used the same expression before, at 226, about the Maenads themselves, to the effect that he is keeping them in prison 'with their hands in chains', ôcapíouç X¿Pa£- Pentheus also orders his servants to bring him the stranger tied up, Sécrpiov TTopeuacrre I Seup ' airróv, 'bring him here bound' at 355- 56, and reproaches the stranger 'who has just escaped from his bonds', ôécrpioç (fivyúv (792). The term is also once used by the chorus, worried about their leader's imprisonment (615). The adjective, therefore, points to the king's aggressive wish to imprison his opponents. We can see how it implicitly characterizes Pentheus' personality, 2,s Note the 'concern with time ', as formulated by Pigeaud (1987) 3. See Chapter I, p. 28, and extensively Chapter IV. 2, pp. 171-86. 2,6 See Dodds (1960) 132 on 443-48, regarding liberation and 'traditional Dionysiac miracle'. 217 'Imagery', then, in the sense of 'staged image' and/or sensuous/sensory motif.</page><page sequence="110">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 101 but also his perspective of the world outside and his behaviour at large. His distorted view of the external world will eventually be realized against himself, turning the person who imprisons into an imprisoned one. (ii) The noun 8eap.óç, 'bond', is likewise used by, and in connection with, Pentheus, and also once by the chorus. This is interesting in that Pentheus seems to be cut off from the level of reality on which the other characters act, and the tying/freeing motif colours his view of things. The chorus* use of the noun, given the estranged nature of their position in Thebes (and in the events), puts them close to Pentheus as the only other character who takes his attempt at repression seriously. The king is at first amazed because the stranger has freed himself from his chains (642-43, 8iaTT6&lt;i&gt;6uyf) 'i ' ó Çévoç, I òç dpTi ôecrpoîç rjv Kairi vayKaap.évos' 'the stranger has escaped me, he who just now was constrained by bonds', and 648, ttoGév au ôeapà 8ia&lt;f)uytbv eÇto nepaç, 'how did you get free of your bonds and pass outside?'); he had earlier been informed by a messenger that the imprisoned women (443-44, àç aui/f)p7Taaasj KaSrjaaç èv Scapolai, 'the women you took off and bound in the chains of the public prison') likewise broke their chains (447-48, aírróficmi 8 ' aÙTaiç 8eapà SieXùGrj ttoSûv | K'f'Séç t ' àvf'Kav GupeTp ' , 'all by themselves the chains were released from their feet, and the bolts undid the doors...'), and later that they did not need any ropes to carry anything from the houses they raided (755, où Seapcov ütto, 'without bonds'). The stranger meanwhile warns Pentheus against constraining him in chains (518, fifiaç yàp à8iKÛv keïvov eiç 8eap.oùç ayeiç, '...for in wronging us it is him that you take off to chains'), and, talking to the chorus, calls his bondage 'most bitter for him [Pentheus] to see' (634). In their final exultation, the chorus are happy being 'no longer under the fear of chains', 8eapóüi&gt; ùttò &lt;f&gt;0ßü) (1035).218 (iii) The symmetrical verbs Selv and Xuciv ('to tie' and 'to free') also play an important role: Dionysus speaks the language of freedom and release.219 At 498 (and similarly at 649), the stranger speaking to Pentheus declares that 'the god himself will free me':Xúaei p.' ó 8aip.0)u aÙTÔç. At 445 a servant reports to the king the episode of the women's flight: they are XeXupLévai, 'released'.220 8eiv, meanwhile, is exclusive to Pentheus' own lexicon or else to his 'area of influence': at 439, 444, 504, 505 the verb is used by the messenger, the stranger, or the king, but always referring to Pentheus' orders.221 218 Cf also Karriua-yKaapévoç ('constrained by bonds') at 643. aùv8ecrp ' at 697, referring to the Maenads' belt, does not seem significant for our analysis. 2,(J On the various articulations of Dionysus as 'liberator' see Leinieks (1996) 303-25. 220 Cf. also, from the same semantic area: SiaXùw ('I release') referring to the Maenads' liberation (447); ¿XeuGcpóco ('I free') used by the chorus of the stranger's liberation (613); 8ta&lt;f&gt;eíryco ('1 escape', 642, 648). &lt; fievycú ('i flee') is used in instances which represent the obverse of Pentheus' constraining impulses: at 734, when the messenger narrates his escape from the sparagmos (4&gt;evyoj; èÇaXúoK tú, 'I escape'); at 1363, when Agave laments her exile; at 659, when Dionysus says he will not leave Pentheus in his expedition to the mountain: gol pfvoupev, où &lt;1&gt;cu£oupe0a, 'we will stay here for you, and not run away'; at 798, when Dionysus comments on the Theban men who will be routed by the women. Cf also fcvyu at 627, 868 and 903. 221 Cf also (Ka0)eipyto 'I imprison' at 509, 618; kXtiCqj, 'I lock', at 653, always referring to Pentheus' action.</page><page sequence="111">102 HIDDEN PATHS (iv) Finally, we have the words for 'prison', 'net', 'trap'.222 eipK-nļ, 'prison', is uttered both by Pentheus and by the chorus, the two poles of delusive aggressiveness and foolish fear which partly share the same level of reality (497, 549). dpicuç, 'net', is again uttered by Pentheus twice and by the chorus (231, 451, 870). The verbal insistence on tying/freeing, then, is very strong. It is also especially significant, compared with the treatment of mania or disease, because of its relative marginality within the Dionysiac tradition. Mania is a leading element in Dionysiac saga, and so to some extent unavoidably central in the play. To a lesser extent, the same can be said of disease, which is another aspect of mania itself; it is not a typical or essential Dionysiac motif, but is easily superimposable onto it. The element of tying/freeing, by contrast, is much less concretely present in Dionysiac saga, even though Dionysus is traditionally 'Lysios', and even though there are earlier depictions of men trying in vain to put him in chains.223 Unlike the case with mania and disease, the extended exploitation of the tying/freeing motif to characterize Pentheus' fall is all Euripides' choice.224 As we have indicated, all the occurrences of the motif in Bacchae are used in a concrete and literal sense; someone is literally tied up or freed from ropes or chains. In tragic poetry before Bacchae , instead, the vocabulary in question is often used metaphorically, as well as literally: 0601110?, for instance, is used metaphorically by Aeschylus (. Eum . 306, and at 332 and 345 in the expression ôéapio? cļ&gt;p£vw), with reference to the frightening song of the Erinyes, which 'binds the mind' of the listener, Seqio? is used by Aeschylus, again, in Ch. 981, with the meaning 'plot against someone', ôeapòv àGXicp TTaTp'i; it also occurs in fr. 235, oréýavos ... Ô6opó? ápioTO?, in a concrete, but metaphorical usage, 'a crown... a bond of excellence'. Elsewhere, Euripides himself uses the noun with reference to 'obligation', Seopòv 8 ' ctSeopov tóv8 ' exovoa cJwXXáSo?, 'surrounded by these suppliant branches, prisoner but not imprisoned' ( Supp . 32) and to the 'restraints' of necessity, èv à&lt;1&gt;ÚKTOiai... Scopol?, 'in the breakless grip [of necessity]' (Ale. 984). The same pattern is apparent with other relevant words.225 222 These terms overlap with the imagery of hunting, which has its own importance: see Chapter III.2, 128-38. 223 See hHom. VII 12-15. 224 The uncanonical nature of the motif engenders comments like that of Dodds (1960) 132: The liberation of the imprisoned women serves no obvious purpose in the economy of the play beyond giving Pentheus the unheeded warning that the supernatural cannot be controlled by lock and key'. 225 Xwo is used of marriage for girls and losing one's virginity (E. Al. 177; Ir. 501). It also occurs in various phrases referring to bodily expressions: crying (Hipp. 290, oTirvi/riv cxf&gt;pw Xvoaoa, 'loosening your gloomy brow'); waking up (Rh. 8, Xùaov ßX6&lt;J&gt;dpcov yopyanTÒv ëôpay, 'loosen your eyes from the stupor of sleep'); letting out war-fury, A. Th. 396; Pers. 913; speaking freely (Hipp. 1060, tí 8f|Ta Toùpòv où Xúio oTÓpa, 'why do I not unseal my lips?'); general relief from pain or sorrow (A. Pers. 594; Supp. 1064-65, 'Ico I Trn|ioi&gt;âç èXùoaT 'Io ended her sufferings'; S.

It occurs five times in Aeschylus (Ag. 1116, Ch. 1000, Eu. 147; àpKÙcrraTa, 'a place beset with nets' at Eu. 1 12, Ag. 1375) and once in Sophocles (El. 1476: ápicuoTáToiç), always non-concretely. Contrast this reading of Bacchae with Worman's</page><page sequence="112">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 1 03 It is remarkable, then, that in our play Euripides avoids using any relevant word in a secondary sense. The further implications of these literal usages are allowed to emerge from the development of the drama itself. All the tying and freeing going on in the play is of a very concrete kind - imprisonment, chains, fleeing from prison - with an uncomfortable discontinuity between concrete and abstract. Euripides' avoidance of metaphor here, as opposed to Aeschylus' abundant usage, may seem, at first sight, only to typify the well-known characteristics of the two dramatists' verse styles.226 For us, it has a different significance, relating to the view of man and self presented in the two playwrights' work, within which a crucial factor is the degree of characters' awareness. In Aeschylus' poetic-dramatic usage, imagery (metaphor and related mechanisms) is often used rhetorically , in the sense that characters are liable to be aware of the imagery constructed in the play through their own utterances; they use imagery as part of a shared common idiom. There is a sort of a pact among characters, with the author, and with the audience. By contrast, the non-metaphorical tying/freeing motif in Bacchae is 'imagery' - if we may still label it as such - of a different kind. It is, so to speak, factual , enacted imagery. The characters are unaware of it, they perform it and are somehow its victims; its meaning may be conveyed through the voices of third parties or as apparently 'neutral' accounts of facts, if taken separately. Nevertheless, this kind of 'imagery' has a deep significance within the play as a whole.227 Its usage, in Bacchae , runs parallel to what we have noted about Pentheus' lack of awareness of (notably) his own mental state: his failure to describe his mental processes in a detailed, objective way as Medea or a Homeric character would. Tying/freeing terms recur often, but in none of the quoted instances are the terms used figuratively by Pentheus (or anyone else) to suggest a deeper meaning, as would happen with rhetorical imagery. Even so, Euripides succeeds in making his audience feel that imprisonment, binding and liberation, quite apart from being a frequently experienced fact in his main hero's staged life, constitute a deeper reality of human experience. He achieves this through a personalization of imagery, a personalization acted and lived, rather than used directly by the characters in their utterances. In Bacchae Pentheus is a man of pain and sorrow, by lived experience, as by his own name;228 imagery here is lived and personalized as a sort of leitmotif, and not a device analysis of the tying-motif in Euripides' Heracles as 'steadily [alternating] between figurative and referential demarcation' (Worman 1999, 99). See also Petrone's comments on the 'metaphor of the net' in tragedy, with Bacchae offering a 'paradigma of the human condition under the influence of the divine spell' (Petrone 1991, 141-43, my translation). 226 See, representatively, Barlow (1971) 1-4. 227 Below, Chapter IV.6, pp. 201-06. 228 In Bacchae , Euripides makes use of word-play on Pentheus' name to hint at non-evident truths: at 508, Dionysus warns the king, 6v8ix7TuxrļaaL Touvop' emTfļSeios' el ('you are fit, with respect to your name, to be unfortunate in it'), connecting the name llevõeúç with the noun tt&lt;éi4)oç ('grief), along the lines of Tiresias' remark at 367-68, TTf vôeùç 8 ' ôtkoç ļif) TTévOoç elcroíaa Soļiois* I toÎç aoî cti, 'may Pentheus not bring grief to our house'. Here, however, the priest significantly adds: paimicfi jièv où Xé-yco, I toi? TTpdvuaaii/ 8é, 'it is not by prophecy that I say this, but by the facts ...' (368-69). The link is also exploited, perhaps, in the conversation between the god and the king (786-88, with the two verbs Trdaxoo and TreiOopai, 'I suffer' and 'I obey', and the name TTei^eusO, and finally at 1244, when Cadmus comments on Pentheus' torn corpse thus: Jj Trévôoç où 1ieTpT]TÓi&gt;, 'o grief not to be measured' (1244-45, however, is deleted by Diggle, following Willink,</page><page sequence="113">104 HIDDEN PATHS characteristic of the play and available to all the characters as, for instance, in Aeschylus. Euripides' avoidance of metaphorical tying/freeing is therefore profoundly significant. The fact that the tying/freeing images are not present in composite-mind or expressly metaphorical instances but in seemingly non-problematic scenes - in which it is always the king's order to prompt imprisonment, and the god's power to offer liberation - ultimately works for a representation of man closed to the outside world, a representation whose hidden sides can be detected only from behavioural utterances and not from any attempted self-presentation. Pentheus' insistence on imprisoning and restraining is, therefore, the clue to a deeper part of his personality - his aggressiveness and refusal to compromise - as well as a figura of his own vain struggle to restrain his weaknesses and temptation, which are the result of his puritanical repression. But none of this is described in terms of (say) 'Pentheus trying to restrain his Gupóç', or 'Dionysus freeing Pentheus' &lt;1&gt;pf)y from its fear and shame'. The inner, subjective situation is presented as objective fact - which in the play it indeed is: the literal instances of tying and freeing we have discussed. The lack of an analytic description of mental processes, and their concretization in a motif like 'tying/freeing' have the consequence of determining a more 'layered' and centripetal representation of man's character than we find in Greek tragedy as a whole. Pentheus' innerness is made of unadmitted elements which surface during the develop- ment of the play. Time is involved here too: the king's character is developed in time, and after his first, bold appearance we begin to know more and more detailed elements of his personality. The imagery of tying/freeing is linked to another important nexus of ideas which influences character representation in the play: doom and the inescapable course of events. At the end of the play (1349), Dionysus, prompted by Cadmus' complaints, seals his intervention among men with a seemingly disingenuous claim, TîàXai TáÔe Zevç ov[iòç €TT€V€V&lt;J€V Tramp, 'long ago my father Zeus approved these things'. This line has been considered conventional and meaningless, a 'weak evasion' on Dionysus' part.229 Giorgio Ieranò sees it rather as part of a powerful irony that progressively reduces Dionysus from immanent divinity to estranged, incomprehensible entity.230 The divorce of necessity from man's action and responsibility has an important bearing on character. The undermining of the plan of divine necessity encourages the progression towards a more naturalistic, 'dramatic' sense of the unfolding events, in contrast to the lack of 'any realistic concern with time' apparent in earlier tragedy.231 Dionysus' affirmation of Zeus' 1966). This kind of word-play is in itself a familiar feature of tragic language (Silk 1996b, 471-72), but has a particular relevance here. Moreover, as Di Benedetto (2004) 141 points out, 'the play with language [in the Bacchae] is a different thing from the 'etymologies' through which Aeschylus believed he could unveil the inner qualities of things through their names' (my translation). 229 See Dodds (1960) 238. 230 Ieranò (1991b). Leinieks (1967) 338-39 takes Elmsley's view, that lines 1344, 1346 and 1348 should be attributed to Agave, thus arbitrarily attenuating the impression of random coldness that Cadmus' punishment leaves us with; for Leinieks this motif of the 'cruelty to Cadmus', largely based on certain sections at the end of the play that he regards as interpolated, is 'a strong argument for the view which sees Dionysus as a Nietzschean nature god'. 231 See Chapter IV.2, pp. 171-86 and Gould (1987a) 49 quoted on p. 28.</page><page sequence="114">CHAPTER 2: VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION 1 05 will at the end of the Bacchae is functionally analogous to the accomplishment of omens in other tragedies; a famous example is the image of the hare and the eagles in the chorus of Aeschylus' Agamemnon (114-21), allusive to the Atrides' curse and to Artemis' rage. Pondering these lines John Jones comments that 'Artemis and Agamemnon and the incident of the eagles' feast ... go together with the existential inter-commitment of the strands of the spider-web whose whole slender frame is set trembling by a touch'. In the Agamemnon there is, for Jones, a solidarity between omen and events; the first is not simply a symbol of the second, but its deeper, truer expression.232 Dionysus' empty apology at 1349, instead, uncovers how the solid relation between man and the outside world and the mutual understanding with fellow men is broken in Bacchae. Similarly, there is a crisis in the Aeschylean solidarity between fj0o9 and Saipojy (to keep Jones' Heraclitean terminology), 'character' and 'destiny'. In our play we have a total, dominant necessity (personified by Dionysus) which constrains all the characters, in more or less explicit ways and in varying degrees. This is expressed by the recurrence of terms connected to the idea of necessity, analysed by Ieranò: Ô6Î, X9% àvayíc-, verbal adjectives in -reoç.233 Then again, we have in effect a parody of necessity, epitomized by Pentheus' desire to bind, ôeiv: Pentheus does not recognize necessity, and dies in ignorance of it as of himself. We cannot claim for Pentheus that the boundaries between character and destiny, doom and will, are blurred and deprived of meaning, as is often said of Aeschylean characters, that there is a 'communion of self or persona with, or continuity with, objects'.234 If it is true that, for Aeschylean character, the question of 'freedom of choice within lack of choices' cannot be conceived as an issue separated from the character itself (who is attached to his or her freedom of choices or not as if to a costume), in Bacchae Pentheus' fall seems less the unavoidable fulfilment of his character than the disgraceful product of his mistakes. His character seems to move within the chronological progression of events with dramatic freedom, his outcome is unpredicted and, arguably, deprived of a clear ideological significance. In this way one great feature of tragedy, the continuity between character and destiny, is, in our play, brought down to the level of the individual on the one hand (destiny as open and personal), and emptied of cosmic meaning on the other (necessity in the divine sense is devalued by Dionysus' self-serving explanation). In conclusion, the treatment of mania, disease and tying/freeing in Bacchae makes Euripides' presentation of character - especially of Pentheus' character - distinct from the characteristic norms of earlier tragic drama. Euripides is unusual in showing us three things: a representation of human innerness more centripetal and closed to the outside; the discovery of (un)awareness as feature of human psyche; and a displacement of character from the context of dramatic events. This last aspect, apparent in the tying/freeing motif in particular, leads us to our next consideration for dramatic character under the heading of 232 Jones (1962) 126. 233 For a full list, see Ieranò (1991a) 45 n. 1: 'Review of the syntactic and verbal construction connected to necessity in Bacchae ' Commenting on the abundance of instances in the play, Ieranò notes that 'what is striking, in comparison with the other Euripidean plays, is not the number of their occurrence but the emphasis put on them' (my translation). 234 Jones (1962) 109.</page><page sequence="115">106 HIDDEN PATHS the 'relational self, where we explore the flawed relationship between man and the cosmos in its etymological sense of 'ordered system'.</page><page sequence="116">CHAPTER III - VERBAL INSTANTIATIONS OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION IN THE BACCHAE : THE 4 RELATIONAL SELF' With the notion of 'relational self we maintain our working distinction between self in isolation and public, contextualized self. If madness, disease and tying-freeing allowed us to focus on character as experience centred on the individual, to analyse the 'relational self we should now turn to the representation of the world, and to how character is presented in its interrelation with the outside and with his or her fellow human beings. The two parts of our consideration of character, private self and relational self, are functional to one another. Their interdependence is based on what should by now be apparent, that reliance on an ordered world allows a representation of the psyche that is objectified, present to the subject's awareness and shared with others; conversely, when the faith in such order (religious, political, and social)1 vacillates, the individual tends to be represented as introverted and inaccessible, closed to the comprehension of others, and ultimately absent to his own consciousness.2 In his unawareness of the events happening around him and his own fears and desires, the Pentheus of the Bacchae is paradigmatic and his character to some extent approximates to modern perceptions of the self.3 Even though we should obviously beware of any evolutionistic approach to ideas about the self and the relationship between self and world, we can contrast 'modern perceptions of the self with the pre-Platonic view of self and world, where the second is centred on the continuity between subject and object and between man and world, and on the overbearing reliance on the world in man's self-definition. Through Homeric and tragic examples we have sought to show how the balance between self and world depends on ideological variables (moral, religious, metaphysical). For instance, in earlier drama the contradictions of life are internalized in such a way as to 'save the world' (as, say, with the composite-mind pattern of Medea's inner dialogue),4 whereas in Bacchae the individual seems to no longer participate in any continuity with his or her world. The human being is now presented as a mixture of visible and obscure parts, of elements that 1 See Chapter 1.7 and 1.8 respectively pp. 41-42. 2 Buxton (1996) 42 suggests that 'a feature of many plays called "tragedies" is the sense they convey of the presence of a metaphysical structure informing and conferring significance on events'; in this perspective, Bacchae is set apart from other tragedies - unless we modify the formula to subsume, not just the conveying of a presence, but also the problematizing of the notion. 1 Cf. Nussbaum (1990, 77), Bacchae 'depicts in a remarkable way the fluidity of the self, its susceptibility to mysterious transforming influences and aspirations', and van der Stockt (1999) 177: 'Pentheus... qui nous rassemble tellement'. 4 See Chapter I, pp. 14-15. Padel (1981, 111) interestingly compares this procedure with children's reactions to the 'double-bind' of contradictory orders imposed by an authority; in Laing's words (1959, 88, quoted by Padel 1981, 111): 'it is intolerable to blame the authority for its inconsistency. Instead of blaming reality, [one]... splits himself. 107</page><page sequence="117">108 HIDDEN PATHS are known and mysterious at the same time, and he or she is ultimately closed to discussion with others and divorced from the world. The world itself is no longer a site of a knowable higher equilibrium and justice, but rather a chaos of forces, principles and flawed relationships.5 In Chapter II we discussed this changing balance of man and world with reference to the representation of self contained in Bacchae' s motif of madness and in its represent- ation of psychological processes. We may now turn to the representation of 'the world'. The worldview offered by our play is one of relativism. There is a lack of trust in the possibility of ever fully understanding or accepting the reality in which we live. The representation of self offers a fragmented and unknowable depiction of Pentheus; conversely, elements which constitute the systemic frame of the world in earlier Greek literature are relativized, made looser or ultimately denied. We shall now consider a number of themes and a group of key- words which highlight the disjunction between man and cosmos expressed in the play, whereby it is felt to be impossible to rely on the world as instrument for one's self-definition. The relevant themes are seeing and the visible; animals and hunting; family and gender; finally, the political oppositions between city and wilderness, and individual and group. The last three themes - animals, family, politics - are straightforward aspects of 'the world' to which the individual has to relate. Animals are a strong verbal and motifemic presence in the play, and a crucial qualifier of what 'human' means in Greek culture, therefore of interest for the representation of human characters in the play. Family and politics lead us to a consideration for societal aspects of the self, from gender and sexuality to the political issues which are paramount in Greek tragedy in particular. The motif of seeing and the visible, on the other hand, involves the very ability of man to perceive and evaluate the world, and constitutes in effect the basis for any ensuing referential analysis. A defective capacity to see precludes reliance on objective (social, political, ideological) categories for man's self-definition. 3. 1 Seeing and the visible The first of our themes centres on perhaps the most pregnant instance of misunderstanding and isolation in our play. The key-words belong to the domain of seeing and being seen: verbs of seeing (opaco and compounds,6 Xcuctcko,7 ctkottéü),8 àôpcto9); organs of sight (tco 5 In an application of 'existentialist psychology' to Bacchae, Sale interestingly notes how the external world is problematized and subjectified when a solid belief in its order is missing: 'the better a tool is working, the less conscious of it are we. It disappears, as Heidegger says, into usefulness. But when equipment breaks, when the thing is no longer useful but is just there, ... the broken instrument, like the word of art, demands awareness' (Sale 1977, 104). 6 òpdo) Ba. 6, 61, 210, 249, 306, 319, 337, 357, 394, 470, 477, 500, 506 (òpdç LP; o Ôpâç Reiske), 591, 634, 680, 693, 740, 760, 811, 815, 823, 912, 914, 918, 924, 927, 940, 983, 1017, 1019, 1050 (twice), 1058, 1062, 1063, 1075, 1095, 1172, 1175, 1203, 1228, 1238, 1244 (deleted by Willink, 1966), 1258, 1307, 1329, 1384 (with Musgrave's p.

Similarly, Tiresias' blindness is a shield which protects or isolates the world from the pollution of a man who has seen too much: the stories of the two men, even though opposed in the tragedy, are brought together by this common destiny. The act of seeing is therefore a subject in its own right in 07, and the very idea of knowledge and reliability is brought into question.38 However, the mythological outcome of Oedipus' story (his disappearance, a popular tale certainly known to the audience, albeit only hinted at in the play) leaves open the possibility of a final ransom, even if only attainable through pain.39 In Bacchae the reverse process takes place: in the presence of a human mistake, it is the world which becomes blind, while the man remains untouched in his impenetrable consciousness and is finally destroyed in the most literal sense. The continuity of inside and outside the self which informs, notably, the Homeric view of man is broken: nothing of what surrounds a person - of what he or she sees - can be taken as reference; conversely, the behavioural utterance of man - the way one is seen - cannot be taken as exhaustive description of what one is. The focus in Bacchae is not as much on the object of sight as on the action of seeing itself and on the 'multiple viewpoint' which that focus is liable to imply.40 The effective presence of a multiple point of view in the play is clear in the usage of a group of terms of different stems connected to the wider semantic area of seeing and being seen. The occurrence of such words in Bacchae is high compared to other plays, and sometimes strikingly so.41 Their usage subsumes several distinguishable motifs: 1) The general idea that 'to see' does not mean 'to know', in that it gives only provisional and imperfect information about reality (3.1.1). 2) What we can call characterful seeing, meaning the point of view of a character as reflecting his inner disposition or beliefs. Seeing becomes thus not only a means of differentiation between things for the viewer, but also an indicator that differentiates between one viewer and another (3.1.1). 3) The motif of hiding and being hidden, spying and disappearing, through which the 'divorce between man and world' is expressed, in particular in the relationship between human and divine. A dynamic of epiphanies and disappearances characterizes Dionysus' 37 Calarne (1996) 28. 38 Buxton (1996) 45: 'if I had to summarize the impact of Oedipus Tyrannos , I would do it like this. What, when it comes to it, can you rely on?'. 39 OT 1457. Cf. Parsons (1988)11 on the realization of this hint in OC : 'if we can find a way of giving the recognition that Theseus [in OC] does, not only do we avoid the fate of Pentheus, but the thing we had been so afraid of may tum out to bring unlooked-for enrichment to our lives'. 40 In any literary-interpretative discussion, 'viewpoint' is open to misunderstanding. Chatman (1986) underlines the risks of confusion between 'internal viewpoint' (of a character) and 'external viewpoint' (of a narrator). Chatman is considering novelistic prose, but his observations are valid for drama as well, where the figure of a narrator is absent or incorporated into the perceptions of the characters. What we mean here is the characters' 'internal viewpoint' which, in the absence of a narrating voice, determines an ambiguous presentation of the overall events. 41 This is obvious with ôpdœ, 'I see', which occurs 48 times in Bacchae (roughly 10% of all the verb's occurrences in Euripides, and highest total for any Euripidean play).</page><page sequence="120">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF 1 1 1 intervention in the play, which is in no way integrated with the understanding and perception of Dionysus shown by the human characters (3.1.2). 4) Metamorphosis and, in particular, transvestism as further expression of a fracture between the individual and his context, as a paradigm of incommunicability in our play. Unlike the transvestism which is strongly present in Greek Dionysiac rituals, theatrical and social (such as attested rites of passage),42 transvestism in Bacchae does not lead to a confirmation or restoration of identity, but to a negation of it (3.1 .3) 43 3.1.1 Seeing and differentiation Characterful seeing in Bacchae is articulated in the preference of one character for (or his or her emphasis on) one term, and in the different meaning that the same term acquires depending on the identity of the character using it. Such differentiation is naturally more apparent with words of a narrower meaning, since the wide usage of verbs of seeing in language as a whole make it more difficult to detect a particular significance for them; even so, different qualities of seeing are apparent in our play. Pentheus, to begin with, has a relationship with seeing that mirrors his naiveté and his literal understanding of life, his self-styled practicality which becomes helpless confusion, and his ultimate passivity. Moreover, his literal understanding of facts produces an involuntary irony that characterizes him throughout the whole play, as opposed to Dionysus' conscious word-play on ideas of seeing and appearing.44 This contrast is visible in the use of other important key-words in the play, such as ao&lt;J&gt;ia, 4 wisdom', or the tying/freeing group. While Dionysus is the only character to make a consciously metaphorical or ironic use of these words, the other characters - and particularly Pentheus - evoke such uses without any awareness of these implications of their language. As far as the 'seeing' terminology and the king are concerned, this group of words evokes the idea of superficial seeing as misunderstanding, and ultimately splits 42 Cf. Gallini (1963) 211 et passim ; cf. Hoffman (1989) on transvestism and ritual licence as intrinsic to Dionysism. Seidensticker (1979) argues that Euripides' choice to incorporate in Bacchae precise references to ritual was meant to confirm 'tragedy as the aesthetic ritual originating from the sacrificial ritual, accompanying or even imitating and gradually replacing sacrifice and its social functions'. On my reading, such allusions, which are indeed present in the play, offer rather a negation of reversal as identity-reinforcing, since the references to world-order are themselves reversed. See also Henrichs (1982) on 'sex roles and age groups' and 'Dionysiac self-portrayal through verbal and visual symbols'. Henrichs describes Dionysiac rites as culminating in an 'ultimate identification with Dionysus' (157-59), a general role-reversal (the old feeling young, for example) and transvestism, which, however, is 'never prominent' (159). We shall see that in Bacchae physical transvestism is not the fundamental event, and the important change is the invisible one. 43 Cf. Goldhill (1988) 155: 'The challenge to the security and boundaries of the self, that the Bacchae represents for so many readers and critics, is articulated not merely by the uneasy separation of self and other in "playing the other", but also by the fracturing of the other in the double's interplay of sameness and difference' (my italics). In the absence of a stable concept of 'the other' - to borrow Zeitlin's (1986) and Goldhill's term, but using 'the other' in the wider sense of all that is external to the individual - lies one of the keys for character representation in Bacchae. 44 Cf. Scott (1975) 338: 'Dionysism, with its emphasis on intuition, unquestioning acceptance, and even a type of madness is totally opposed to everything in Pentheus' character'. On the other side, the king's attitude, rational and practical, produces what Scott calls 'Penthean literalism' (338). See also Wohlberg (1968) 154, 'Pentheus is matter-of-fact and literal, while the Stranger is allegorical in his comments'; and Euben (1990) 147, 'Pentheus is too literal-minded, too narrowly empirical'.</page><page sequence="121">112 HIDDEN PATHS the etymological unity of seeing and knowing present in the Greek language (the root *wid- shared by ol8a and 6l8ov, 'I know' and 'I have seen').45 Statistics clearly show this mismatch between the man and his divine opponent. The verb ópdoj and its compounds (elaopdo); KaGopdco) occurs 62 times in the play; 7 of these are uttered by Pentheus, and 19 by Dionysus, yet there are 31 references to Pentheus' 'seeing', and only 11 to Dionysus'.46 These ratios make it clear where the balance of verbal power lies, and equally who does the talking and who is talked about. The king (whose use of 'seeing' words is straightforward and everyday) is unaware of the self-parodic effect of his language, for which the reader or onlooker is prepared by Dionysus' overt insistence on the motif.47 Pentheus emerges as naïve and literal-minded. From the beginning of the play, characters appeal to his common sense by inviting him to see things: Tiresias at 306 (€t ' avTÒv otļnļ Kàm A£'&lt;f&gt;taiv TT£Tpai9, 'you will see him even on the Delphic rocks leaping ...') and at 319-20 (opaç; cru xaí-pet9, ÖTav 6&lt;f&gt;€crTcoaiv ttuXcuç I ttoXXoi ..., 'you see, you rejoice, when a throng stands at the gates...), Cadmus at 337 ('you see the fate of Actaeon', òpâç ...). At 713 the messenger says to him, 'if you had seen, you would address him with prayers' (euxdtaiv âv |i£Tfj'0£9 elaiScbv Táôe); at 737-38, 'you would have seen a Maenad' (ttjv 'xev àv ttpoœélôéç); at 740, 'you would have seen flying limbs' (eîôeç 8 'dv) and at 760, 'a strange sight to see' (ouuep to Seivov f)v 0éap ' ISfîv). In the last two examples the phraseology, conventional for messenger-reports,48 underlines the paradox of Pentheus' inability to see the divine despite (literally) facing it. Dionysus' way of treating the king also insists on the opportunities that he has to see but systematically misses. Talking to Pentheus, the god often lingers on the idea of seeing forbidden things, hinting to the audience at the reversal of this idea, namely that Pentheus himself has become a 'forbidden thing', which will be seen. At 811, Dionysus proposes, ßoiAr]... 186ÎV, 'do you wish to see [them]?'; and at 815, he says, opcoç 8 1 18019 av fļSec 09 ä croi micpá;, '...and yet you would enjoy to see things that are bitter to you?'; at 823, he warns Pentheus to watch out not to risk being 'seen as a man', r'v dvf]p ò&lt;j&gt;0fì9 6K61; at 912, again, he calls the king one who 'wants to see things which should not be seen', oe tòv TTpó0upov övt ' a pf) XP€&amp;V ópdv; the same expression recurs at 924, when the king finally 'sees what he must', vûv 8 ' ópq9 a xPfl a ' òpâv. The sarcastic tone is unmistakable: Pentheus' acquired 'right sight', the sight of hallucination, is exactly what allows him to see what the god was previously calling 'something not to be seen' (a pfļ xpçùv ópâv, 912). At 914, Dionysus invites Pentheus, all dressed up, to come and be 45 Cf. Gregory (1985) 27: Pentheus' crime is not his voyeuristic weakness in itself, but the fallibility of his seeing, his inability to gain knowledge from his autopsy. 'Men see what they are disposed to see' (28): Pentheus 'never sees with the eyes of faith' (29), but applies secular parameters to divine matters. 46 This 'verbal passivity' of Pentheus' has also been noted in our discussion on tying and freeing (Chapter 11.3, esp. 103-04). 47 Ba. 357, 477 , 814, 918, 1062; 840 XavOdvco ('I escape notice'); 954 Kpirnrto ('I hide'); 236 and 1060 òooe ('eyes'); 646, 925 &lt;J&gt;aívo) ('I appear'); 501 ^avfpòs' öppaaiv ('visible to [my] eyes'); 838 KaTaaKoirri ('exploration', 'inspection'). 48 To involve the addressee/listener in the speaker's autopsy is a typical 'plausibility reinforcing' device in messenger speeches.</page><page sequence="122">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 1 3 seen by him, ö&lt;f&gt;0Tyrl poi; at 940, he promises Pentheus he will be satisfied, once he has seen how chaste the Maenads are, òtolv..X8t]ç. The temptation to see is one that Pentheus takes literally, forgetful of the possible significance of 'seeing' in religious contexts above all.49 His innocent use of certain expressions hints at this 'active sight' beyond his intentions, as at 357, when threatening the stranger, 'he will see a bitter end to his Bacchic rites' (micpàv ßaKxeucav èv Or^ais lôwv). This idiomatic expression is echoed later by Dionysus' words about Pentheus, at 634: TTiKpoTaTouç i8óim Ò€G[íovç tous* èpoùç, 'my bonds most bitter for him to see'. Here the same adjective, mKpóç ('bitter'), defines the disastrous outcome of the king's will to chain his opponent: in effect, 'my chains now look bitter to him'. Pentheus himself uses the verb 'to see' in the sense 'to experience' at 510, when he wants to make the stranger see the darkness of prison, ùç âv ctkótiov eioopa KV6&lt;1&gt;aç ('so that he may look on gloomy darkness'). Also significative of a limited, elementary understanding is the king's insistence on visible proofs. At 469, he naively asks Dionysus whether he has seen the god face to face ('was it by night or face to face that he compelled you?', TTÓTepa 8è vÙKTOjp a' fļ kot' ò[i'i ' f)váyKaaev;), questioning the stranger's self-claimed relationship with the god, and contrasting dreaming with seeing. Here seeing is conceived as reliable perception, ironically opposed to Pentheus' own faulty eye-sight and (soon) to his own statement at 501, whereby his öppaTa, his eyes do not allow him to see the god: when Dionysus claims that the god is there, Pentheus insists he cannot see him (501, où yàp cf&gt;av£pòç öppaaiv y ' èpois' 'he is not visible to my eyes'), so that at 502 Dionysus teases him again: où 8' aaeßfi? aÙTÒ? ův oùk eicropaç, '... but you being yourself impious do not see him'. The conversation between the two characters is constructed throughout on a double level, where the existence of a common reality is denied. Arguably, any appearance of gods in disguise entails the deception of the human party, but in no other instance in Greek literature has the failure of man to recognize god become so foregrounded and crucial in determining events, particularly not in parallel with a negation of the human party's individuality.50 In Bacchae it is as if the very condition for understanding the world and communicating with others were missing. In the interplay between the two characters, Pentheus' eagerness to see has a practical significance. Even though at 814 he awkwardly hints at his desire to watch the women drunk on the mountains (XwTpûç vvv €icri8oip ' dv è^cpFcapéiAiç, 'it would give me pain to see them drunk'), and again at 1062 (ï8oip' àv òpGcoç paivá8o)P aiaxpoupyiav, 'I would see properly the disgraceful activities of the Maenads'), he regularly fails to understand seeing in the deeper sense. This deeper sense that he misses concerns both 40 Foley (1980) 122 rightly says that 'Pentheus is destroyed through his confinement to one level of language and sight. His imagination is limited by his own lack of self-knowledge, and the frame of the cultural order in which he exists ... He repeatedly seems unable to see - or hear - the implications of the speeches, sound or images presented to him'. And again, 124: 'Pentheus fails not only to see and interpret symbols, but he remains unaware or fatally resistant to the fact that linguistic signs can refer to more than one valid level of meaning at once'. 50 Cf. Rose (1956) 67-68, who claims that what Ajax says at II. XIII, 72 seems to be true: 'gods are easy to recognize, dptyvcoToi, in other words they cannot disguise themselves so completely as not to be detected if one is careful to look closely'.</page><page sequence="123">1 14 HIDDEN PATHS himself as viewer (what does his curiosity mean?) and, more widely, the knowledge which in Greek terms is deeply linked to autoptic observation, and to which others try to call his attention. Pentheus' sight remains the sight of a KctTáoxoTToç, a spy, as in Dionysus' words (916, 956; see also &lt;J&gt;úXa£, 'a guardian' at 959, and ļiacmp, 'a searcher' at 985) and in the negative words of the chorus (at 981-83 he will be seen by his mother Sokéúovtci, 'as he watches' from a okóXoi/;,51 a 'sheer rock' or 'pinnacle'). Yet the king, for his part, uses a cognate word innocently, in the sense of 'inspection', at 838: 'io'eiv Xpri TTpûTov èç KaTaoKOTTf|v, 'I must first go to reconnoitre'. In his great plan, Pentheus' concern is to be unseen (e.g. 1050, 'to see without being seen', tbç ópeopev oùx ópcppevoi), to be properly dressed for the disguise (e.g. 925, 'how do I look then?', ti &lt;ļ&gt;aivopai 8fļT ' ;), and to reach the best strategic position to watch from (1058-62). The dangerous character of this seeing, then, is absent from his own consciousness but underlined by the god's verbal insistence. Moreover, at 829 the god calls his opponent 0e&lt;rnfe ('spectator'), like a mystery initiate;52 he says that Pentheus will be eTrCcrrļM.os*, 'conspicuous' (967), and the king himself declares he is available to go 6[i&lt;£avojç, 'openly' (818), in almost a parody of the god's will to be ('visible') in Thebes (22). Dionysus is deliberately ironic about Pentheus, while Pentheus is an unwitting parody of Dionysus. The uses of &lt;¡&gt;olívlú ('I appear'), 8ok€co (I seem'/'I believe') and ópdco ('I see') also reveal the king's confusion. At 645-46 he does not understand the stranger's sudden appearance from prison (ttûç TTpopoumos' I (1&gt;aíwy.., 'how can you appear at the front...?'), echoing again the theme of epiphany on which Dionysus insists in the prologue, and which the chorus celebrates in the fourth stasimon (ïtco 8íko 4&gt;avepóç, 'let Justice go manifest' at 992 and 1011; Ta 8 ' ere pa peyáXa ýavepá, 'these other things that are great and manifest' at 1006; &lt;f&gt;áve0i Taupos*, 'appear as a bull!' at 1017; Qeòç &lt;f&gt;aívTi [léyaç, 'you are revealed a great god' at 1031). 8ok60) ('I seem', 'I believe') is used by Pentheus himself of his own freedom, as he believes, to deliberate, àv 8okt1 ... ßouXeuoopai, 'I will deliberate... on what seems best' (843b).53 Elsewhere, the term indicates the man's misjudgement (in Tiresias' mouth at 311 and 312, and in Dionysus' at 480, ...Tļv SoKfjç peu, fļ 8è 8ó£a oou voofļ I ýpovelv 8ÓK61 Ti' '... nor, if you have a belief, and your belief is sick, believe that you are being wise'), or his full derangement (at 624, 8cijpaT ' aï0£CJ0ai 8okûv, 'thinking that the house was on fire'; at 918, ...ópav poi 8úo pèv f]Xiouç 8okû, 'I seem to myself to see two suns'; at 920, Taupos* fļpiv Trpócr06v Tļyeia0ai SoKels*, 'you seem to be leading, ahead of me, as a bull'; at 957, 8okû o(pâç èv Xóxpaiç opui0as* ojç, 'I suppose them to be in the thickets like birds').

See also ÔoKf úo ('to look at closely', therefore 'to spy') applied by the chorus to Pentheus at 984.</page><page sequence="124">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 15 hallucination. At 506 the god tells him: ouk olo0 ' ötl £f1s' ovó ' o 8pds' ovó ' òoriç el ('you do not know what your life is, nor what you are doing, nor who you are'); at 624, he 'sees' the palace-miracle, and remains shocked and bewildered; at 918, he has double sight and sees the god changing shape; at 1058, on the mountain, he still fails to see the women, but only manages to be seen by them. In these scenes seeing and being seen, in appearance opposed, finally come together with Pentheus' death. Pentheus' passivity in the unfolding of this process culminates in his exposure to the Maenads' fury: he is inordinately concerned with secrecy and being hidden, at 954 (ép.òv KpvipLú 8éi±aç, 'I will hide my body'), at 955 (Kpú^ ov Kputļav iļv oe Kpucļ&gt;0fjvai Xpeojv, 'you will be hidden in the way that you should be hidden'), at 816 (&lt;Jiyrļ ...

XdGpa, '... even if you go secretly'), at 840 (ttûç Si ' dciTÉCoç elļit Kaôp.6iouç XaOcóv, 'how can I go through the town without being noticed by the Cadmeians?') and, conversely, we see his objective exposure at 914 (e£i0i rrápoiGe 8iop.aTcov, 'come out of the house!'), at 982-83 (ficrnrip TTpcoTd viv Xcupctç díro TTéTpaç I rj ok oXoTTOs* oberai, 'his mother first will see him as he spies from some sheer rock') and in his final position as £&lt;f&gt;f||i€vov, 'sitting on top' at 1074, at 1075 (üj&lt;J&gt;0t] 8e p.aXXov f| KaTÉÎSe paiváSaç, 'rather than seeing the Maenads he was seen by them'), and 1095 (elSov eXán} 8£ottótt]v è&lt;f&gt;f|p.£vov, 'they saw my master seated on the fir-tree').54 Dramatic passivity becomes literary passivity. With his one-sided understanding, Pentheus becomes the unconscious enactment of irony not only through the teasing of Dionysus, but also against the background of facts. For instance, one notes 940, where Dionysus says that Pentheus 'will see the women wise', or 1258, where Agave calls for her son, as she wants him to 'see her happy'. Again, at 927, Dionysus congratulates him by saying 'when I see you I seem to see [the women]', and at 941-42 Pentheus himself wonders, TTÓT£pa...| f|...ßdKXTi [íâXXov e'iKaa0f|ao|iai, 'shall I... I as to seem more like a Bacchant?'; finally, Agave at 1253 hopes that Pentheus may 'be a good hunter, made like (elraofteis-) his mother'. One corollary of Pentheus' way of seeing, noted by Flaumenhaft, is an inability to 'look together', that is, to share the same level of perception as others.55 The flaws in the king's perceptions (reliance on hear-say; inability to communicate; spy-like and voyeuristic behaviour) bring him close to another character, Tiresias (who is blind, holds a profane viewpoint, and looks from afar), and ultimately give him a personal, private, isolated and detached view of the world, at the opposite pole (one might add) from Athenian theatrical experience. Dionysus' characteristic idiom has already become apparent from the analysis of Pentheus as viewer and viewed. With Pentheus, Dionysus adopts an elusive, provoking, unstraightforward rhetoric; he extracts a maximum of irony from the notions of seeing and appearing, also playing on the ambiguity of his position as disguised god. At 500, he tells Pentheus that the god is there, present, and 'sees' (opa) all he is suffering; at 470, he convinces Pentheus he has actually seen the god ópùv òpùvTa, 'face to face', speaking 54 The visual role played by the dead body and severed head of Pentheus in the play has been convincingly analysed by Whitehorne (1986) 59-67 under the heading of 'the dead as spectacle'. 55 Flaumenhaft (1994) 66: Pentheus is 'an isolate, outside communal, as well as private, combinations. He wants to see, but his looking must be seen by no-one'.</page><page sequence="125">116 HIDDEN PATHS ironically of Pentheus' preconditions for belief; at 914, he invites the dressed-up victim to come and be seen by him, in a scene which recalls the first meeting between the king and the god, at 453-59, when Pentheus looked at the stranger and commended his looks (oùk apopaos- el, 'you are not ugly in body', 453); at 917, he congratulates the king thus, TTpéTTÉiç ôè KáSpou GiryaTépcov pop&lt;f&gt;í)v pia, 'you look just like one of Cadmus' daughters', while at 927 an ironic suggestion that 'looking at you, I seem to be looking at them [the women]' (aÙTàs* èiceivaç elaopáv ôokco a ' opův) seems to hint at the equivocation about identity which will be crucial at the moment of Pentheus' death. At 629, reporting the palace-miracle to the chorus, Dionysus styles himself a mortal witness with the precautionary expression (bç čpoiye patverat, ôó£av Xéyoj, 'as it seems to me at least, I say my opinion only'; we have a similar expression in the god's narrative at 605 (cbç 601K6, 'it seems') and at 638 (cbç Sé pot ôoKel, 'as it seems to me'). The god's idiom oscillates between the objective concept of showing himself to man,56 and the ludic usage of words he proffers when addressing another character. In this last case, he apes the incredulity of Pentheus (470), his eagerness to see (914), and the provisionality of human understanding based on seeing (605, 629, 638). The god's words to his adversary, through allusion and irony, shift between presenting Pentheus as the spy who wants to see in the wrong way, or fails to see, and as the one who is seen in the wrong way by others, or fails to be seen as who he is. The two poles of profanation and exposure characterize Dionysus' portrayal of the king, and ultimately become the two facets of the misunderstanding that isolates Pentheus from the rest of the world. This correspondence between Pentheus' derangement and, so to speak, the world's derangement sets Bacchae apart from other madness-plays, where the judgement of the world remains the key reference-point. Here the evolution of the character unfolds together with a change in the world into which he is inserted - the breach in the continuum that, in the earlier Greek view of man and self, granted the possibility of objectifying one's inner states and of communicating them to others. Agave's and Cadmus' seeing, in contrast, is marked by pain and pollution, as we see in the last scene, which produces two of the three instances of the verb Xéiktctgo, 'I see'/'I look ať in the play.57 This verb indicates intense seeing, intense in the sense of emotional involvement rather than of intentionality (which in English would oppose 'watch' to 'see', a distinction not as sharply made in the Greek language).58 Etymologically, it is no doubt connected with XeuKÓs' 'white/splendid/shining' (which explains its specialization in the sense of 'looking at'/'fixing one's eyes on an evident/sudden image'),59 an implicit link which plays an important role in the representation of the divine in the play, as well as in Agave's recovery: Cadmus makes Agave look at the sky, until she finds it Xap.TrpÓTepos' fļ upiv Kai 8i€iTr€T60T£poç, 'brighter than before and more translucent' (1267).60 56 At 22, and in the whole prologue in particular, he insists on his mission to become è to mortals (see also 39, 47, 50) by disguising himself as a mortal (4, 53, 54). For divine epiphany see III. 1 .2. 51 At 596b, uttered by the chorus; at 1232 by Cadmus; at 1280 by Agave.

The light element, connected with the seeing-motif and with</page><page sequence="126">CHAPTER 3: THE * RELATION AL SELF 1 17 Agave is craving for and obtains the acknowledgement of the chorus. At 1172 the Lydian women receive her (opů Kal o€ 8éÇop.ai ctùykû)(j.ov, T see and will receive you as a fellow-reveller'); Agave's idiom is epideictic, with an obsessive repetition of tóç clauses with verbs of seeing: at 1 175, &lt;hç òpav Trapa, 'as can be seen'; at 1203, ëXôeô ' coç ï8t|T€ tt|v8 ' dypav, 'come to see this prey'; at 1238, cbç ópaç, 'as you see'. At 1258, she wants someone to call her son 'so that he may see me, the blessed one', cbç lSt1 y 16 tt)v eù8alp.ova, another involuntary irony: her son has already seen, and has already been seen. Her father Cadmus' despair is always expressed as commentary on the horrible scene he is seeing (1232, Xeùacrco yàp ainr)v, oijjiv ovk €Ù8al|iova, 'I see her, not a happy sight'; 1244, ai tt£v0oç où |i£Tpr|TÒv où8 ' olov t ' í8eiv, 'o grief not to be measured nor able to see';61 1307, alaxicrra Kal KáKicrra KaTÔavóvô ' opû, 'I see [Pentheus] dying in the most shameful, the worst way'). In dialogue with her father, she begins a recovery which is primarily based on seeing. Cadmus says at 1264, èç tóv8 ' aiôép ' 0ļi|jLa gòv piOeç, 'turn your eye to this upper air'; and she replies at 1265, L8où* ti p.oi tóvS ' èÇuneÎTTas' eiaopav, 'there.

What do I see?'.62 After this, her wish at the end of the play 'neither to see nor be seen by the mountain ever again' gains a greater significance (1384-85):63 fif|T€ Kiôaipœv ëp. 1 'í8oi piapòç ļif |T£ Kiôaipûv' öaaoiaiv èycó.64 . . .neither Cithaeron may see me, nor I (may see) Cithaeron with my eyes. From this inventory emerges a schematic contrast between different qualities of seeing, a metaphorical, problematized one articulated mostly through the words of Dionysus, the characteristically naïve and literal seeing of Pentheus, and the partial, imperfect seeing of the other characters. Straightforward as it is, the king's idiom betrays epiphany, plays an important role in the play, being linked both to sanity and derangement, divine punishment and choice. These connections are, in Bacchae , mechanisms of discussion and relativization, rather than unproblematic allusion to religious themes. As suggested by Scott (1975) 343-45, darkness is both marker for Dionysus and the Maenads (218, 485, 510, 875-76, 1052), and an element of shame and punishment for Pentheus (486, 457-59, 510); on the other hand, 'light* and fire are linked to Dionysus too (e.g. 146, 608, 624). In this way, the basic opposition, darkness/clarity, blindness/vision is brought into play, so that Pentheus' vision of 'two suns over Thebes', apart from conveying an image of derangement, also testifies to the non- straightforwardness of sight and image in themselves. If we accept the suggestive hypothesis of Seaford (1987), that in this scene a mirror was used, we have a vision both of two Pentheuses - the king and the Maenad - and of two suns. The distortion of the self and the perversion of the world become the two outcomes of the same fact, a wrong vision. 61 1244-45 deleted by Willink (1966). 62 Cf. Cadmus again at 1283, 'it does not seem to you to be like a lion, does it?' (|iûi&gt; aoi Xéoim &lt;1&gt;aíveTai TTpoaÉiicéyai;). Another aspect of human seeing is marked by the verb &lt;jkott6üj, 'I look ať, 'I consider', used by Pentheus at 257 to refer to Tiresias' art of reading the future, and used by Tiresias himself at 317, during his sophistic demonstration of the appropriateness of Dionysus' cult: oKOTTeiv XPH* &lt;one should consider 64 See above, p. 99 n. 213.</page><page sequence="127">118 HIDDEN PATHS his helplessness through its very isolation. We have analysed the occurrences as they appear in the mouths of the two main characters on the basis that the word-play in Bacchae is unusual in being personalized and revealing of character; also by way of demonstrating that in Bacchae the addressee of utterances is determinant on a verbal level. The idioms of the two characters oppose one another: Dionysus' allusiveness has religious and initiatory overtones,65 as well as allusions to spectatorship and, ultimately, to a deeper idea of seeing itself, related to the concept of knowing and therefore to the crocf/ia theme. Conversely, Pentheus' 'sight' is mainly a matter of spying and being hidden, when it is not a superficial trust in what he literally 'sees'. It has been interestingly argued by Barrett that we can identify two functions in the play, those of the onlooker and the participant.66 Analysing such figures as the messengers, the herdsman, and the servant, Barrett argues against Buxton67 that these characters have a role outside the drama, that they are 'virtual spectators-in-the-texť, and that this function of spectatorship belongs to a wider pattern of metatheatricality in the play. What interests us here is the implications for the presentation of character. On Barrett's reading, Pentheus fails to become a spectator (in either a theatrical or mystical sense), and turns into a spectacle; Dionysus claims that he has come to Thebes to reveal himself through epiphany, but remains an untouched spectator, and finally vanishes unseen; the servant at 1043-152 is only a spectator, he remains unseen by the Maenads and is cut off from interaction with events; the herdsman, at 677-774, is a non-realistic eye-witness (he could not have seen all he tells), and assumes an 'impersonal vision'68 which conveys detachment and places him on the privileged level of an omniscient spectator. The corollary of this condition is the impossibility of acting, on Barrett's reading:69 the herdsman's attempt to become an actor must inevitably fail. The spectator/actor distinction is also useful in distinguishing between characters acting without awareness (Pentheus) and characters with full awareness of their actions, as of their words (Dionysus). Pentheus, and Cadmus too, are spectacle; failed spectators; bound to action. The messengers are spectators and confined to inaction. Dionysus is the only character who is able to operate on both levels. However, there is no need to take Barrett's and Buxton's positions as mutually exclusive. What Barrett calls 'externality' to the drama is, as far as characterization is concerned, still an internal component of the drama itself. Buxton's analysis of narratives 65 Cf. Ba. 1047, where Geiopía ('viewing') is used with reference to the 'expedition' of which Dionysus is TTopTTÓ9 ('escort'; cf. also 965); the same term is used in the opposite direction at 1381, where Agave begs the TTOļiTToi to lead her away from the city. Cf. Foley (1980) 1 16-26 and (1985) 208-18 on verbal references to 'Dionysus' Festivals' in Bacchae , Ferrari (1979) for an analysis of the parados in terms of 'phases of the chant preparatory to the rite', and Di Benedetto (2004, 24-30) for an exploration of the points of contact between the Bacchae and the testimony offered by Orphic texts, especially with reference to Tiresias' speech and to the nature of Dionysos Lysios. For Di Benedetto, however, these links are 'not central to the play's discourse'. An interpretation of our play in terms of mysteries is extensively argued by Seaford (1981, 1998a, 1998b, 2001), and anticipated by Thomson (1979). 66 Barrett (1989). 67 Buxton (1991). 68 On these verses see also Di Benedetto (2004) 122-26. 69 Barrett (1998) 350.</page><page sequence="128">CHAPTER 3 : THE 'RELATION AL SELF' 1 1 9 in our play shows the different degrees of participation and awareness in them: Dionysus' account at 23-42 is authoritative and shows his causative control over the action; Pentheus' narrative, at 215-25, reveals his black-and-white hostility to the women, and the hearsay character of his information; the servant's narrative at 434-50 is the report of a citizen and an eye-witness, but humble and credulous; the herdsman's speech (660-774) belongs to an outsider and an eye-witness; he is convinced that if Pentheus had seen, he would believe, and he himself hides in an attempt to catch the women; the third messenger (1043-152) shows intense sympathy and his narrative conveys strong emotion through a rhetoric of delay and suspense. As Buxton says, these speeches work for a consecutiveness in the play and for the presentation of a variety of view-points.70 Such consecutiveness and (so to speak) 'characterfulness' constitutes an important part of the play, even when the effect is achieved through apparently extra-theatrical means, such as confining the messenger's speech to a spectator's inactive position. The fact of different degrees of involvement and (un)awareness has a major con- sequence: the representation of human relationship with the world is failed and unstable. The prospective bearer of divine order in the play, Dionysus, is the most remote and mysterious presence in all extant tragedy. His utterances during the action, ambiguous and deceptive even when he is dealing with his chorus of Asian followers, are in marked contrast to his self-presentation in the prologue, which is rich in concrete statements and intentions with which the onlooker or reader can agree or, at least, which he or she can understand. The prologue begins by making sense of something (the god's mission) that by the end of the play has more than one sense; it is centred on the god's disguise (popcļ&gt;f]v S ' €K 0e ot) ßpoTricrtav, 'having changed my form from god to mortal', at 4; 01T1TÒV àXXdÇaç ex^ I pop&lt;J&gt;f|v t ' è'ir'v p.€TeßaXov eis àvòpòs &lt;f&gt;úaiv, T have acquired mortal shape and changed my form to the nature of a man', at 53-54), 71 and on his recent arrival (t^ko), T am come', is the first word in the play, at 1; at 13-20, we have Xlttcüv. . .f)X0ov, T have come, leaving...'; at 55, he addresses his chorus with to XtTTouaai, 'you who have left. . . '). On the other side, his exit from the action is dry, conventional and self-serving. In his presentation in the prologue, in fact, Dionysus puts emphasis on his epiphanic intent of showing and teaching Thebes that he is a god: vv ' fiqu èp&lt;f&gt;aWì? ôaipcov ßpoTot?, 'so as to be a visible god for mankind' (22); 8eî yap ttóXiv tÍ)v8 ' 6K|ia06LV' Kel 'ir' 0éXei I crréXeaTov ouaav tîou è'iûv ßaKX€U|aaT(ov, 'for this city must learn to the full, even if it does not want to, what it is to be uninitiated in my bacchanals' (39-40); fyavêvra 0UT1TOIÇ Saiļiou ' , 'appearing to mortals as a god' (42); 6v8eí£opai, 'I will show myself' (47); Seiícvuç èpauTÓv, 'revealing myself' (50); &lt;hs opa KaSļiou ttóXiç, 'so that the city of Cadmus sees' (61). At 976, he makes a promise of 'showing', TaXXa 8' aÙTÒ arpaveî, 'the rest the event itself will show'. However, by the end of the play, the main addressee of his showing, Pentheus, has died in ignorance; Agave has not acquired wisdom about religious reality, but seeks only forgetfulness (1384-86); Cadmus displays a perplexed acceptance of the god's revenge (1346); Tiresias 70 Buxton (1991) 39. 71 53-54 have been condemned as tautological (Hermann) or misplaced {cf. Willink 1966, 30) and deleted by Bernhardy. See, however, Dodds (1960) 69: 'there is a good practical reason for the repetition, in the necessity of making it quite clear to the audience that the speaker, whom they may accept as a god, will be accepted as a man by the people on the stage' .</page><page sequence="129">120 HIDDEN PATHS is not even present. It is true that at 1296 Agave says 'only now do I understand' (apTi |iav0dvo)); that at 1345 Dionysus reproaches his mortal audience, 'too late you have acknowledged me' (o ijj ' 6pá060 ' ipà?); and that at 1 1 1 3 Pentheus finally learns that his death is near, 'he understood that he was close to disaster' (kokou yàp ékkù? ojv 6|aav0av€v). However, the learning ('iavQáv€iv) in the play is of a negative kind, and is experienced only on a limited behavioural level - not on a sapiential or religious plane: SuaTTļv' àXf|0€i' (bç kv ou Kaípco Trápci, 'unhappy truth, how you come at the wrong moment!' (1287).72 The god's action within the world has only been destructive and abusive, without reaching the heart of man:73 the gap between the human individual and the god, who re- presents the system ruling the world, remains wide open and unbridgeable, and Pentheus' torn body (see Agave at 1210, té Gqpòç äpOpa 8i6&lt;ļ&gt;opf)aa|i€v, 'we tore apart the limbs of the beast') suggestively offers us an image of the impossibility of a communion between man and world such as informs Greek literature elsewhere. This image of the king's corpse is underlined suggestively by Agave's question at 1300, fj nâu eu ápOpoiç auyKÉKX^p-ÉUOu KaXtoç; ('has it all been fitted together decently in its joints?').74 A special significance attaches to Dionysus' dry riposte to Cadmus' plaintive comment on the disproportion of his merciless vendetta (1349, TTdXai tcxôé Zevç ou| íòç éttévéu CTÉV TTaTfļp, 'long ago my father Zeus approved these things'). As Ieranò has noted, between the beginning and the end of the play the god evolves from a joyful, familiar figure integrated into the context of man (Dionysus as relative of the Cadmeians, 72 See Di Benedetto (2004, 482) on 1345: 'Dionysus does not frame the issue in terms of understanding, or of good or bad will, but in terms of knowing or not knowing [that he is a god]. The actual knowledge, however, the fact that now his divinity is acknowledged, does not change the situation. Dionysus uses the second person plural at 1345, dismissing the difference in the reactions to his arrival within Pentheus' family. The Aeschylean ethical- religious frame is turned entirely upside-down' (my translation). Radically different is Seaford's position (2001, 253): the condemnation without appeal that falls upon all main characters, with no distinction (Cadmus, Agave and obviously Pentheus) has to be connected with their belonging to the royal family (which would explain the fact that Tiresias, instead, is spared). On this reading, there is indeed a beneficiary of Dionysus' 'epiphany': the polis of Thebes, where new Dionysiac rites will be established for the future. Nothing of this constructive outcome, however, can be detected in the tone of the ending of the play as it is. Even if we had the missing lines in the two lacunae (at 1300 and 1329) and they confirmed the establishment of the rites conjectured by Seaford, this would probably not alter the sense of despair and meaninglessness that the closure expresses to us. Compare the discussion on Cadmus' indifference to Dionysus' prediction of his reward after death, in the Isle of the blessed, in the face of his desperation for the present loss (p. 185 below). 73 The human and the divine action take place on different levels: Pentheus is left free to follow his own inclinations. Burnett (1970) 18 rightly notes: 'we see at once that Bacchae is absolutely and essentially different... an unprecedented relationship between the god and his victim is established: Dionysus' intentions at the beginning of the play are all positive, and the pathos of the hero, Pentheus, appears only in the second part of the play as a consequence of his reaction to the god's message: the religious crime is committed during the play, is not a precedent to it, in a unique way in the extant tragedies'. However, I do not agree with Burnett's reading of the final scene of the play, where she divines 'an essentially merciful quality of the god's resolution' (29). Man is rather left to face the destruction he has caused, without explanation or redemption, and regardless of the different responses that the various characters had to the arrival of the god. 74 However, the possibility of a felt etymological connection between the TpixJ&gt;f| ('luxury') that Dionysus promises to Pentheus (969-70: TTe. Kai TpixJ&gt;âv p' àvayKáaeis'. I Ai. Tpu^ás* ye Toiáaô ', Penth.: 'you will compel me to be pampered even' I Dion.: 'pampered in my fashion') and ôpírnro), 'I break into pieces', argued by Kepple (1976) and supported by Segal (1997a) 70, is implausible. On the sparagmos- motif, see also Easterling (1987).</page><page sequence="130">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 2 1 repeatedly evoked as part of the family75), to a conventional, estranged, distant reality. The disappearance from the action of the play of the 'Semeie motif (which granted the familial closeness of Dionysus to Thebes) is part of this process as well.76 By the end of the play, we face a 'call to order', with the god back in the role of incomprehensible Euripidean divinity from which man is alienated.77 3. 1.2 Epiphany and miracle Events in the play are characterized by a dynamic of appearance and epiphany. There is the appearance of Dionysus (l);78 of the two elderly men, Cadmus and Tiresias (170); of the stranger led by the servants (434); of the god, again, who has freed himself from prison (576; 604); of the (f&gt;áa|ia 'phantom', 'ghost' (630);79 of the god in his divine transformation as bull (920-22; cf. 618); of the dressed-up Pentheus (914, 1075); of Agave with her prey (1168); of Dionysus as manifest god, at the end (1330).80 Such presentational modes must characterize theatre by nature; however, in Bacchae the focus is always on the apparition in itself, as something exposed to be seen. In this emphasis on appearances, the questionability of the object of seeing is foregrounded. The god's disappearance from the mountain (1077) is another symptom of this vision of the world as unstable, unknowable place. Pentheus' vain attempts to hide are, again, only a feeble parody of the god's disappearance. Having ruled out the object of seeing as main feature of the events, the focus is then shifted onto the perceiving - and perceived - individual, whose inner processes come under the spotlight. A corollary of a 'crisis of the visible' is the fact of miracles as a mode of divine inter- vention in the human world. The suspension or distortion of natural processes is indeed a normal feature of divine activity in Greek religion; however, in Greek myth it tends to present itself mainly aetiologically, so that thunder, for instance, is explained as manifestation of Zeus and the plague (in II. I, 43-52) as manifestation of the arrows of Apollo. Famines, epidemics, mass-sterility and other natural calamities are seen as divine ways of interfering with the world-order, whereas miracle as gratuitous addition of something to the natural order, with no analogical connections of any sort, seems to be an uncharacteristic modality, and in tragedy in particular. Dionysus' miracles in the play, however, belong to this second, untragic type: the vine growing on Semele's tomb (11- 12), the streams of water, milk and honey (142-43; 704-1 1), the appearances of the cf&gt;dap.a (630) and the ensuing palace-miracle, the miraculous suspension of nature before the killing of the king (1082-85) - all of these are gratuitous.81 Contrast, for instance, the way 75 leranò (1991b) 288. 76 leranò (1991b) 289. 77 leranò (1991b) 290. 78 Dionysus' identity as epiphanic and even emphanic god is an important feature of his make-up; see Chirassi- Colombo (1991) 338; 343. 79 See p. 62 n. 8. 80 Dionysus' actual appearance comes at some point in the lacuna after 1329 - by 1330 he has already begun to speak (see p. 99 n. 214). 81 For this reason it is perhaps ungenerous to say that 'miracles cannot happen in Pentheus' ordered world', as Blaiklock puts it (1952, 217): miracles in Bacchae are not the ordinary tragic expression of the divine.</page><page sequence="131">122 HIDDEN PATHS Apollo assists, and then abandons, Hector in Iliad XXII, or the way Athena restores Odysseus' physical attributes at Odyssey VI, 229-35: the divine intervention here does not contradict the nature of the hero itself, as Dionysus seems to do with Pentheus. The elements of the miraculous also tend to imply a kind of deconstructive sparagmos of the human world, which, in literary terms, determines that polylogism of different voices, different versions of facts, which remain unresolved until the end of the play.82 In this world-frame, the divorce between 'see' and 'know', elôov and 018a, is finally sanctioned. As Gregory says, 'every act of seeing [in the play], whether Pentheus', Agave's, the chorus', or the god's, is both private and provisional. All claims to true wisdom and insight, accordingly, must be treated with qualification'.83 3.1.3 Metamorphosis The last aspect of the visible that we need to consider is metamorphosis. This is exper- ienced at various levels in the play, from the point of view of the viewer {e.g., Pentheus' hallucinations) and as physical change the characters undergo; this last mode of metamorphosis is especially interesting for our analysis of character. In Greek literature, in fact, metamorphosis is related to a change in the relation between man and world, which is reflected in a physical, perceptible change. Just as in our play we have a shift toward the 'inner' side of characters in the representation of madness, so does the external metamorphosis become less important than the inner one. Transformation of people's external aspect is a constant within the play, parallel to the distortion of reality and to the inner metamorphosis of characters, notably Pentheus and Agave. In Greek myth, metamorphosis is generally the expression of a character-flaw or a fault committed; hence myths of metamorphosis as punishment, as with Atalanta and Melanion, who were transformed into lions for having profaned a god's temple. Such an 82 Does the palace-miracle really happen? Is the &lt;f&gt;da|ia an apparition, is Dionysus really transforming himself into a bull, or is it just Pentheus' derangement? This kind of doubt comes with a loss of conviction about the world as a system. The chorus as objectifying presence normally plays an important role in limiting ambiguity in the text; in this respect, it is interesting to recall Foley's connection between the unusual position of the chorus in our play ('they stand between us and the more extreme perspective of the maddened spectators to Pentheus' tragedy on the mountain') and the 'creation of multiple audiences', which makes 'the spectators conscious that they are viewing and interpreting the god's actions through a series of subjective perspectives and performances' (Foley 1980, 112). Cf. also Goldhill (1986) 278: 'indeed, as [the palace-miracle narrative] continues, the uncertainty of the boundaries between illusion and reality (an uncertainty focused on the question of representation) is strongly emphasized'. 83 Gregory (1985) 30. For 'the motif of seeing as imbued with a sophistic spirit of relativism' and its socio- cultural implications (31) see Roux's commentary to Bacchae (1972) 11-71: Bacchae is read as 'drame de l'impiété' and 'drame du rationalisme sophistique'. For Roux (49) the first rationalist 'propagateur d'incrédulité' stigmatized in the play would be Pentheus, 'le sophiste, le démagogue'; however, Dionysus himself displays rhetorical techniques to a large degree, and he is repeatedly accused by Pentheus of 'tricking with words' (e.g. at 475, 479, 489). His gifts to men are also such popular 'social benefits' that the charge of demagogy, as well, would perfectly suit him - so that some have even seen in him a sort of staged mythical double of Alcibíades (Carrière 1966; contrast Zuntz, 1972 on the limits of interprétation historique). Tiresias, on the other hand, despite his claim that one should not 'make sophisms about the gods' (200), is perhaps the fullest representative of a certain type of enlightened intellectual; he decides , in a sort of Pascaban way, to bet on the existence of god. See also D'Ippolito (1978) and Longo (1989) on Bacchae as anti-sophistic play, and Cantarella (1974), who argues, in the light of Aristophanes' Frogs , for Bacchae as a 'truly and dangerously religious tragedy' (309, my translation).</page><page sequence="132">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 123 outcome usually takes place with the total awareness of the subject who passively undergoes it. In Bacchae both patterns are challenged. First, an external metamorphosis is in some cases chosen by the characters (as with Cadmus and Tiresias, then Dionysus); secondly, an inner metamorphosis takes place without the character's realization (Agave and, above all, Pentheus).84 A comparison with another staged character who has undergone a metamorphosis may be helpful here. In Prometheus Vinctus Io has already been transformed into a cow by Hera when she meets Prometheus. However, within her change of aspect Io maintains a deeper consciousness of her human nature and destiny. As her own discourse makes clear, the choice of the cow-form, in particular, is deeply linked to both her nature and her fate, namely to her Cretan origins and to a family-history which somehow unfolds under the sign of the bull.85 The cow is an expression of a part of her nature, but also a containing skin from which she longs to be, and will be, liberated. In our play, despite Pentheus' apparent freedom of choice in dressing up, the metamorphosis happens at a much deeper level, beginning long before the visible change is made overt, and the character remains completely unaware of it.86 Let us take a closer look at these two elements of metamorphosis in the play: the external, visible, intentionally chosen; and the deeper, psychological. We shall see how, within Pentheus' fate, the two periodically converge, with the external, which is the main focus in all metamorphosis-myths, becoming the mere manifestation of inner change. In Dionysus' self-presentation, as we have seen, his disguise as mortal is a crucial point. The insistence on the god's transvestism is both part of his strategy of action among man, and part of the general emphasis put in the play on the stranger's look, in particular by Pentheus. At 235-36, the king comments: ÇavOoiCTi ßooTpuxotaiv cüoap.os' KOjiTļv, oivoottóç, ocraoiç x^ptTCt? ' A^poSiTTi? êxcov87 with fragrant hair and light-coloured locks wine coloured in face, having the graces of Aphrodite in his eyes . . . At 353, he refers to the god as a 0r|'Ú1iop&lt;f&gt;ov Çévov ('stranger of female appearance'), with a -pop&lt;j)f|- compound like the one that Dionysus will use for Pentheus at 855, yuvaiKÓpopcfjov. At 453-59 Pentheus declares: 84 Cf. Henrichs (1982) 144: 'Greek ritual in general was traditionally action-oriented (&lt; dromena ), repetitive and stereotyped, externalized and unreflected ... a studious re-enactment of an inherited response rather than a personal expression of inner feelings or religious sentiment'. Warning against the risks of applying modem psychological models to Dionysism, he adds that 'the essence of the Dionysiac experience apparently culminated in a visible imitatio Dionysii, accomplished through external and mechanical means' (158, my italics). This makes Pentheus' case even more aberrant: 'of all the Dionysiac transvestites known to us, only the Pentheus of the Bacchae, in Euripides' psychological portrayal, undergoes a "true change of personality'" (159). See also Henrichs (1984b) 90-91. 85 Pasiphae, the Minotaur, Ariadne, Phaedra, Hippolytus: all their destinies are affected by the bull. 86 The metamorphosis of the queen into a bitch, predicted by Polymestor in the final lines of the Hecuba (1265-84) is no exception: it reflects to some extent the vengeful character of the queen, and is a transformation of which she will be aware. 87 At 235, euoapoç is Brunck' s correction for euoapov LP; eùoapûv Tyrrell, euoajiov Kopûv Dodds.</page><page sequence="133">124 HIDDEN PATHS crrdp to [lèv aajļj.' oùk ap.opcķos' el, Çéve, (hç èç ywaÎKaç, €&lt;ļ&gt;' ÖTT€p es* Bf)ßa? rapei* 455 TrXoKaiaos1 Te yáp aou Tavaòç ov i'á'r'ç utto, yevvv Trap' aimļv Kex^M-evos1, ttó0ou JiXéoòç- XeuKTļv 8è xP0L^v €K TrapaaKeiriļS' êxeiç, ovx fļXiou ßoXalaiP àXX' uttò cnaáç tt1V ' A(ļ)po8iTT)v KaXXouf) Gripcojievo?. Well, you are not ugly in body, stranger, as far as women are concerned, which is what you have come to Thebes for: for your locks are long, not by wrestling, flowing down right by your cheeks, full of desire. You have a skin white by contrivance, not by the rays of the sun but under shade hunting Aphrodite with beauty. Pentheus' prejudice makes him notice certain aspects of the god's appearance, but construe them in a particular way, the feminine and 'foreign' characteristics, the long hair88 and white complexion. It is interesting to contrast the servant's comment on the stranger's look, at 438: ou8 ' (oxpos' oü8 ' fļXXa^€v oívcottòv yévvv, '[he was] not pale, nor did he change his wine-coloured cheek'. The servant's attitude, humble and open- minded, makes him see Dionysus as 'wine-cheeked', for him a sign of the stranger's rel- axed confidence, whereas Pentheus is concerned with his paleness and the moral meaning it suggests: no wrestling in gymnasia or proper outdoor activity. The two characters see two different strangers, a feminine, pale one and a red-faced, manly, confident one. The god appears from the beginning in mortal disguise. Later on, however, he will assume the form of a bull during Pentheus' derangement - or such he will seem to his victim (920-22): 920 Kal Taupos* flpiv TrpóaOcv fìy€ia0ai Sokéîç Kal aco KépaTa KpaTi TrpoaTT€&lt;f&gt;UK6vai. àXX' f) ttot' f)a0a 0f|p; TÉTaúpcoaai yàp ouv. and you seem to be leading, ahead of me, as a bull and horns seem to be on your head. Were you a beast before? For you are certainly changed into a bull ! 8X A scene in which Dionysus was 'taunted with his effeminate appearance and costume' was present in Aeschylus' Edoni, and must have been a model for Euripides in the first scene between the god and the king (see Dodds 1960 xxxi-xxxii, Mureddu 2000, 120-22). What is entirely Euripidean, however, is the insistence on points in common between Dionysus' look and Pentheus' final outfit, as a comparison between the prologue (1- 63) and the dressing-up scene (821-46; 912-70) reveals. The detail of long hair in particular, that seems to fascinate and scandalize the king, characterizes Pentheus himself, as argued by Schmoll (1987). In interpreting line 831, KqiTiv jièv èm aû Kpafi Tavaòv éicTevû against Dodds' interpretation, 41 will stretch this wig down over your head', Schmoll refers KÓpr|V to Pentheus' own hair, with the result that 'Pentheus is repelled yet attracted by Dionysus' appearance which, save for the flush of wine in the cheek of the god, is so much like his own' (72). A final allusion to Pentheus' hair comes at 1 188, where the chorus comment on his severed head: TTpéTrei y óknr 0fļp aypauXoç &lt;J&gt;oßa, 'he looks like a beast that dwells in the country, by his hair'.</page><page sequence="134">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATION AL SELF' 1 25 A bull will appear in the stable, to be tied up by the hallucinating Pentheus, who mis- takes it for the stranger (618), while at 1159 the chorus calls Pentheus' guide a Taupov TTpoiyyriTfjpa, 'a bull as leader'. The chorus of Asian women will invoke the god (whose identity with the stranger they ignore, creating another ambiguity) in his manifestations as bull, serpent, and lion (1017-19): cķdvnrļGi Taupos* fj TroXÚKpavoç Lôélv I ôpaKcou fļ TTuptc^Xéycou I ópâaôai Xécov, 'appear as a bull or a many-headed snake (for us) to see or a fire-blazing lion to behold'. Finally, at the end of the play Dionysus disappears as man (1077: Kal tòv Çévov pèv oük£t ' eiaopâv TTapfjv, 'it was no longer possible to see the stranger') and reappears ex machina , finally manifest as a god (1330-51). The figure of Dionysus encompasses all the ambiguities of the play: instead of being the bearer of world-order, he presents a parody of it and incarnates its provisionality. He is a god to the audience; a stranger, effeminate trickster, womanizer and bull to Pentheus; a leader to the chorus; a man and finally a god to all the other characters. The second set of characters to be touched by metamorphosis are Cadmus and Tiresias. Their dressing-up is presented as a parodie and superficial transformation,89 of which they are, evidently, completely aware. Again, while the god describes his disguise as [iopcf&gt;f| ('form', 4) and &lt;f&gt;ucriç ('nature', 54), suitable expressions for an organic change which, with his power, is easily achieved, the external 'disguise' of Cadmus and Tiresias (like Pentheus' own) is a &lt;7K£uf| ('attire', 180) made of bits and pieces, a collection of elements clumsily put together, as Pentheus sees them: iToiKiXaicri veßpicn. ('dappled fawnskins', 249); vdpGrļKt ('fennel-roď, 251); kictctóv ('ivy', 253); dvpaov ('thyrsus', 254).90 In similar fashion, Cadmus' acceptance of the cult is a dubious blend of various motivations: general common sense, family interests, an accommodating openness, and the influence, we are made to think, of his authoritative companion (186). At the end of the play, Cadmus will be rewarded by the god for his view of religion with the snake metamorphosis for him and his wife Harmonia (1330-33). This difficult passage, in which Dionysus predicts the destiny of exile which awaits the old Theban as his just punishment, has 'puzzled mycologists' and has an abrupt, ecphrastic character.91 The second metamorphosis of Cadmus (like the first) betrays his failure to succeed in a deeper transformation: Cadmus has not gained a wiser view of life from his Dionysiac experience. In Agave's case we have, by contrast, two parallel metamorphoses, the inner one, which takes effect throughout the tragedy, and the external one, described for Agave in terms of aK£ufì...òpyicav èficou ('the trappings of my mysteries', 34) which the god says he has imposed on the women of Thebes. Her main transformation is the internal, which culminates in her action against her child, where she behaves against her nature as a human being, a woman, and a mother. 89 It is difficult to see, with Fisher (1992) 182, a 'miraculous rejuvenation' of the two characters in a scene which is, for him, 'not comic'. 90 Analogously, Pentheus' comments on the stranger's look at their first encounter are more concerned with particulars than with substance. At 493 and 495, again, the king wants to attack the stranger through just these particulars: 'first I will cut off your delicate locks'; 'next hand over that thyrsus'. 91 Dodds (1960) 235-36.</page><page sequence="135">126 HIDDEN PATHS Pentheus' case is analogous. His external disguise is a KÓapoç,92 an 'adornment' made up of specific axf|p.aTa, 'figures', according to the god's indications.93 At 821 the god orders him: cJTeiXai vvv à|i&lt;J&gt;i XPWT^ ßuaaivous iréirXovç, 'now put linen robber around your skin'; at 831, KÓpx)v lief èuï crû Kpcrri Tavaòv cktcvú, 'I will on your head stretch out hair at length'; at 833, ttcttXol TroSipeiç* cm Kapa 8 ' eorai piTpa, 'robes reaching to the feet; and on your head there will be a sash' ; at 835, 0upcrov ye Xcipi Kai ycßpoü (jTiKTÒv Ôépoç, 'a thyrsus for your hand and the dappled skin of a fawn'. This is a material process centred on appearance and accessories, with no essential or substantial metamorphosis, just like Cadmus' and Tiresias' dressing-up.94 Yet his real metamorphosis begins much earlier, and is different from the one signified by his new look as a Bacchant: he has not been transformed into a Maenad, but from the arrogant king he was, he has become (or turned back into?) an unsure, foolish and sensual adolescent; from a persecutor he has become a victim. This is the substantial transformation he is not aware of: the staging of this unconscious change is parallel to, and made possible by, his (and the play's) lack of a stable world-frame as a reference for objectivity. Let us consider again the example of Io at Prometheus Vinctus 673-77. Io and her vicissitudes: èvOvç 06 popcķfi Kai &lt;ļ&gt; péueç 8iácrrpo(J&gt;oi fļoav, KepaoTÍç 8' ùç ópcrr', òÇuaTÓpco 675 |iúiom xPLCJ9cLa' èppavci OKipTripan fjaaov TTpòç 6UTTOTÓV T6 Kepxveiaç pcoç Acpvris- re Kpf|vr|v Immediately my shape and wits became distorted: I grew horns, as you can see, and a sharp gadfly's sting made me leap and rush about madly in the direction of Kerchne's fair waters and the spring of Lerna. Io's destiny is framed within a strongly governed world-order. She is fulfilling an oracle (658-71) and the vendetta of Hera. Her metamorphosis includes her pop&lt;(&gt;f) ('shape') and &lt;f&gt;pév6Ç ('wits') as a whole, with no foregrounding of any detail of physical appearance (unlike the case of Pentheus, who wrongly believes the only metamorphosis he is undergoing is the one he has chosen for a cunning strategy). In sum: Io is aware of her change; she is aware of a fundamental metamorphosis as different from a simple 'dressing-up'; her change is recognized by others (Prometheus, the chorus); she is subject to the necessity of a supernatural order. Once again, we see how the fact of being implicated within a strong metaphysical system enhances self-consciousness through objectification of oneself, communication with others and consistency of individual 92 koctiio? ('adornment') at 832 and 857; Koapéw ('I order', 'I arrange') at 934. 93 Ba. 832; the same word is used for Harmonia's metamorphosis at the end of the play, at 1358 (Nauck's conjecture). 94 See in this connection Usher (2000): crrcXXcTai, used at 1000 with reference to Pentheus, is to be taken as 'he arranges himself instead of the usual 'he sets forth', implying that 'the chorus is fully aware of the fact that, in spite of his mock initiation, Pentheus' real nature has not been changed' (74).</page><page sequence="136">CHAPTER 3: THE RELATIONAL SELF' 1 27 feeling and world-order. Pentheus, conversely, is unaware of his real change, split between two metamorphoses (inner and outer), confused about both of them, isolated and misunderstood by others and lost within the contingencies of an arbitrary game. Pentheus* ignorance - his inability to see his own p.op&lt;J&gt;fi Kai &lt;f&gt;péveç 8iáaTpocf&gt;oi, 'distorted shape and wits* - is evident from the way he behaves throughout the whole dressing-up scene: the markers are, as elsewhere, superficiality, foolishness, pedantic literalism. First, he is reluctant to wear women's clothes out of shame (822, 828, 836), but he is eager to do it none the less (824, 838), with a characterizing and recurring duplicity about feminine dress-up and the female world. In fact, Dionysus says he will drive him mad in order to push him to dress as a woman (850-53), as he would not do if Pentheus' mind were sound. But we have seen Pentheus attracted by feminine looks before: even while still sceptical, in the first part of the scene (811-61) his half-restrained desire is apparent.95 In the second part of the scene (913-70) Pentheus is out of his mind; he is now subject to hallucinations and offers no resistance to Dionysus' plan. His excitement is evident: he is pleased with himself (925); he has a lock of hair out of place because he has been dancing in the palace, in imitation of his mother (930-31); he entrusts himself to the stranger like a woman to a lady's maid (934-36); at 937-38, fooled by the god about the pleats of his dress, he manifests coquettish concern; at 941-42 he is scrupulous about the detail, again, of the modalities of ritual: 'shall I hold the thyrsus in my right or left hand, if I want to look more like a Bacchant?' (this is an attitude that Cadmus, another superficial 'initiate', anticipates at 184-85: 'where must we go to dance? Where to set our feet and shake our grey heads?'; and again, at 191, 'shall we not proceed in a chariot to the mountains?'). According to the king's own (subjective) view, he has been disguising himself properly so as to be a perfect kœt óckott oç , 'spy' of what the Maenads themselves have called xopoù? Kpix^aiouç ('secret dances', 1 109); at the same time, he takes pleasure and satisfaction from the mimetic game, proud of resembling the women (925-29) and boasting about his courage as warrior-man who is ready for battle on his own (962). Objectively, though, he is heading towards exposure; he is not disguising his nature, but opening it wide to the onlookers' sight; he does not act with the authority of an avenger, but is rather an instrument of the god;96 his looks betray his identity as a male, and reveal him as a victim (his ok€vt' also, as has been noted, resembles a funeral dress).97 As he is attacked, finally, he throws away his disguise (at 1115-16, piTpav kò'±t's otto I 6ppi((;6v, 'he threw the sash from his hair...') and undergoes a rushed and sanguinary 95 See e.g. 824, where he exclaims to the god, 'another good point! How clever you are, and have been all along!'; or 826, 'how might your advice be successfully put into practice?'. 96 On this point, cf. Kalke (1985), who analyses the motif of 'crowning' in Bacchae (the 'making of a thyrsus'), arguing that 'Pentheus ... is transformed visually into a symbol of Dionysus. Pentheus becomes the thyrsus of the god: first he is crowned with long hair and a mitra, than he himself crowns the tip of a fir tree raised by the Maenads on the mountain, and finally he becomes the literal crown of the thyrsus carried by his mother' (410). 97 Rehm (1992) 77.

In fact, many suggestions are contained in the dressing-up motif: from initiatory rites, to burials, from hunting, to the stereotype of womanish vanity, to a reference to warriors dressing up for battle, as noted by Di Benedetto (2004) 407 who compares Paris in II. Ill (328-39).</page><page sequence="137">128 HIDDEN PATHS undressing at the hands of his mother and her companions (1 125-36), being literally torn into pieces until his ribs are 'bared', yupvowTo.J TTXeupai, 'his ribs were being bared' (1 134-35).98 All in all, metamorphosis in Bacchae is the ultimate instance of misunderstanding and negation of order, thus contradicting its meaning as an objective transformation which should express a change in the relation between man and world (as with the fate of Io). The physical transformation of characters here is the pale expression of inner, psychological development." The code of appearance is deprived of a fixed meaning. Just as the world does not offer a stable image of itself, the characters are strangers to one another and to themselves. All these elements, seeing and being seen, hiding and being hidden, epiphany and vanishing, change and transformation, are presented in such a way as to imply, or create, a mistrust in the visible: the world is not seen as the same thing by all characters, and the relationship each character has with it is personal and incommunicable to others. This fact is of the greatest importance for the representation of man, which ceases to be objective and straightforwardly expressed through behaviour and verbal discourse, and begins to be entrusted to non-apparent, subconscious parts of the self. In the light of this dislocation, we may now scrutinize the other end of the broken man-world continuum : the questioned and unreliable organization of the world external to man. 3.2 Animal world, animal representation, and the 'hunting -model' Seeing and the visible are somehow a 'prerequisite' to the representation of the world in a play, as the quality of seeing and being seen cannot but determine how the subject represents the world to himself or herself. Having explored seeing we turn to representation of the world (for which how things are 'seen' acts as a 'filter').100 We begin with the depiction of the natural world, especially the animal world. First of all, we should specify that the romantic problem of a definition of 'nature' is not one of the issues raised by the extant Greek tragedies, so that it would be forced to load the passages in the Bacchae where the natural world is depicted with an 'arcadie' longing for a primitive 'lost paradise', as to some extent does Segal.101 I do not mean that 98 yupvóo) is not unusual in the figurative sense 'to expose', or 'to unsheathe' (the sword): compare II. XII, 398- 99, Her. 3, 64. See also Her. 4, 61 for 'to strip the flesh from the bones'. The interaction between yupvexo 'I undress' and yupvóco 'I tear away', however, is exploited when the robed Pentheus is both undressed and stripped of flesh. 99 What the chorus see as Pentheus' 'real nature' is hinted at earlier (538-40) in a comment on the king's aggressiveness: à vaýaíve i x^óvioy I yéi^oç ye ÔpdKovTÓç I ttotc TTcyOeúç ('he reveals his chthonic heredity, being descended from the dragon, Pentheus...'). 100 Strictly speaking, we are concerned only with 'referential instances' of representation, i.e. those that take shape within the enclosure of the play, and not in the interplay between such enclosure and the metatheatrical. 101 Segal (1997a, 31) argues that Euripides in Bacchae sets himself against the 'philosophy of the fifth century', which asserts 'man's independence from nature', a tendency epitomized (on Segal's reading) in Sophocles' famous ode in Antigone (332-52), by the 'voice of a countercultural, counterrational longing in which Western man has repeatedly sought an alternative to his attitude of domination and control'. Such an abstraction of 'nature' seems to me alien to the Sophoclean passage. What is notable in the Antigone ode is the unproblematic way in which the human environment is presented: the sea (335-38), the earth (338-41), animals (342-52), civilization (353-56), diseases (363-64). These are all features of an organic world of which man is part and with</page><page sequence="138">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 29 tragedy is all city, with nature coming into play only in a subsidiary fashion. However, the problematization of nature in itself, as opposed to the political or social organization of man, is never a foregrounded theme, arguably because such an opposition was not felt; nature is, somehow, taken for granted}02 Against the background of a tradition where nature is present 'by default', in Bacchae nature becomes another domain in which world-order is denied. A 'journey to the wild' is a province of Dionysiac cult, and not an Euripidean novelty; however, the opposition in the play between wilderness and civilization admits no reconciliation, nor does it represent an order in the human world that can be upheld by allowing given forces the role they deserve.103 The civilized world shows itself as more irrational and incomprehensible than the wild, and the unfolding of events is characterized by a mimesis between the two, such as to empty the opposition of any constructive implication.104 If nature in Bacchae is felt negatively in its suspension in favour of the miraculous, it is felt positively in the representation of the animal world.105 For the purpose of the play, this world comprises: first, the relationships between human and animal; secondly, rearing and (especially) hunting as images of these relationships; finally, the negation of the orthodox relationships of power between hunter and hunted through the action of Dionysus. The analysis of these features by Segal in his book on the play has much to say about (indeed exhausts the subject of) the blurring of boundaries between usually opposed entities, such as city/wilderness and man/beast.106 What concerns me here is to decipher the meaning of Segal's pattern for the representation of man. Interpretation of Bacchae which man has a straightforward relation in the shape of navigation, agriculture, animal-rearing, politics, and medicine respectively. These elements of human environment are among many specified 'wonders', 8a vd, but with 'nothing... more wonderful than man', où8év...8eivÓTepov (332-33). The difference between Euripides' vision in Bacchae and this conventional Greek vision is not in the overcoming of an ideal of man dominating nature, or in a triumph of nature over man, but in a crisis in the relationship between the individual and a comprehensible world: as we shall see, conventional modalities of man's relation to 'nature', such as rearing and hunting in particular, are presented in an original, even chaotic, way here. For a different, existential interpretation of a nature/man conflict in Bacchae , see Tschiedel (1977). 102 Cf. Flaumenhaft (1994) 62 on the unsuitability of Romantic categories for Bacchae : 'the Bacchic attitude is very different from that of the poet who self-consciously looks at the natural world [e.g. Wordsworth]. The Bacchantes have never seen a landscape'. 103 Henrichs (1990) 259-60, discussing 'Dionysiac articulations of the city/country', rightly remarks that there are 'aspects of the Attic Dionysus not found in the Bacchae and rarely considered in contemporary scholarship', in particular as far as his 'coming from the outside' is concerned. Various literary and non-literary evidence confirms Bacchae' s presentation of 'the divinely induced perversion of an actual cult' (257, my italics): Antigone's fifth stasimon (1115-52), for instance, offers us a 'benign and salutary [Dionysus]... in comparison with the vengeful and violent homecoming of the god dramatized in Euripides' Bacchae' (265). 104 A reading of the play centred on the 'intolerable question: is the rational world of Pentheus the sufficient truth?' (Dyer 1964, 21) seems to me too simplistic. The rational world of Pentheus is denied an autonomous existence throughout the play, and the king's behaviour, from his inmost psyche, follows the same modalities of wild irrationality as the outdoor mysticism of the Maenads, as we shall see in the mutual exchange of hunting keywords between characters. 105 Likewise in the representation of the flora and other 'landscape' elements of nature, but these will not be analysed here, as they impinge much less on human characterization than the animal element does. For a list of such references to the green world see Dyer (1964) 18-19. 106 Segal (1997a) 27-157.</page><page sequence="139">130 HIDDEN PATHS often overemphasizes the negative (what does Bacchae deny? what does Bacchae break or blur?) in the name of Dionysus as god of transformation and ambiguity, 'the elusive god', in Segal's formula. Let us not forget that this 'elusiveness' was never conceived, in Greek Dionysiac cult, merely as a force destructive of order, but as a reinforcement of order through reversals. The lack of this reinforcement in Bacchae , and the abortive character of Dionysiac experience there, has to do with the deeper purpose of the Euripidean play and with the world-frame within which its Dionysiac experience takes place, rather than with the nature of the god Dionysus itself.107 Analysis of the animal world in Bacchae reveals that the traditional opposition bet- ween man and animal is deprived of a safe reference for human identity; that the typical roles of the rearer and, above all, of the hunter as controllers of animals are deprived of stability; finally, it confirms that the world of the play is dangerously dependent on the characters' perceptions. First, animals are present in the play, both in its imagery and in its literal reference, more extensively than in any other tragedy. There are snakes: crowning the Maenads at 101 (ôpaKÓVTcov, 'snakes'); at 539 where the chorus calls Pentheus €K(1)vç ye SpdKovToç, 'descended from the dragon' (likewise at 1155); at 698 and 768, licking the women's cheeks (ö&lt;1&gt;eai, also 'snakes', and Ôpcko vtéç); at 1017-18 as form of the god (TToXtJKpavos,...ôpdKcoy, 'many-headed snake'); at 1026 connected to Thebes' origins by the second servant (ôpdKovroç... olios', 'the 'serpent snake');108 for Cadmus' and Harmonia's metamorphoses at 1330 (ôpaiccou) and 1331 (ofeoç) and again at 1358 (ôpdKQjy 8paKaivT)s' '[I], a snake, [and her] a female snake'). There are foals and fawns in the chorus' imagery: ttûXoç at 165 and 1056, veßpo? escaping the hunter's net at 866- 76. There are bulls: Dionysus is defined as TaupÓK€pcov, 'bull-horned' by the chorus at 100; a bull, Tavpos' appears at 618, victim of the king's frenzy in the stable before the palace-miracle; Taupot... ußpicrrai, 'aggressive bulls' at 743, in the Maenads' sparagmos of the cattle; &lt;f&gt;avr|0i Taûpoç, 'appear as a bull' at 1017, as manifestation of Dionysus invoked by the chorus; Taupoç...8oK6Îç and TCTaupcoaai ('you seem... a bull'; 'you are changed into a bull'), in Pentheus' perception at 920 and 922; finally, as Pentheus' guide, Taupov TTpoTiyfjTTpa, 'a bull as leader' at 1 159. There are other cattle in the herdsman's report: dy6Xata...ßoaKf|paT' ('herds of cattle') at 677 and puKT|pa0'..K€po&lt;f&gt;ópiov ßoüu ('horned cattle') at 691; u£popévaiç...pócrxoiç ('grazing cows') at 735-36; TTÓpiu ('young heifer') at 737; 8apdXaç ('heifer') at 739; àyéXri ('herd [of Maenads]') at 1022. There are gazelles and wolf-cubs breast-fed by the women at 699, 8opm8 ' f| cncúpuouç Xúkgüv. Then there are birds: at 957, Pentheus plans to spy on the Maenads, fancying they are 'in the thickets like birds (opvi0aç ois*) held in the most pleasant nets {ev ëpicecriv, 958) of love-making'; at 748, in the first messenger's speech, the frenzied women are likened to a flock of birds in flight, ¿jctt ' ôpviQeç àp0£iaai 8pópco ('[raised] like birds, 107 Cf. Hoffman (1989, 102): 'all [reversal-cults] concern the dangers of unleashed forces and the restoration of order that is symbolized by the temporary condition of the world in reverse'. Cf. also Lada-Richards (1999), Chapter 2, esp. 60-68 on 'initiatory role reversals' in Greek culture, and Henrichs (1990) 257-58, who emphasizes, again, the uniqueness of cult in our play: 'the myth of the Bacchae... portray s a worst case scenario characterized by the temporary suspension of normal civic and social mechanisms, including culf (258, my italics). 108 1025-26 del.

And then there are lions: Xeatvaç dé nvoç at 990, where the chorus accuse Pentheus of having been brought forth by a lioness; TTupi&lt;1&gt;Xéya)v...Xéoov, 'fire-blazing lion' at 1018-19, where Dionysus is invoked by the chorus in his lion-form; then more lions at 1 141-42 and 1 196, products of Agave's delusion. It is characteristic and significant that the animals in the play are not confined to their natural domain, but are both used as imagery and literal (albeit striking) presences in the human world (as with the snakes licking the women, or the breast-fed cubs, or the slaughtered calves). The first modality is not new - it is enough to think of Homeric images from the animal world to express warrior-like fury;109 and the second, though here unusually widespread, is not in itself extraordinary.110 Yet the insistence on both a literal and a figurative usage of the animal element overall makes any mechanical distinction between vehicle and tenor problematic. Cadmus is condemned to become a snake, and snakes we have (through the messenger's eyes) seen interacting with the Maenads; symbolic hounds of frenzy should be hunting Pentheus, and real cubs have been breast-fed by the women; Dionysus is invoked as a lion, Agave believes she has killed a lion, the chorus thinks a lioness must have given birth to Pentheus; a bull or cow is an image of Dionysus, a product of Pentheus' hallucination, an actual animal in the stable; a 109 As in IL XII, 41-48. See also representations of animals on Achilles' shield at II XVIII 573-86. Animal imagery is also recurrent to qualify groups left at the margins of the adult male community (the young, women...). This happens in poetry, but also applies to ritual roles. For instance, in Athens, a young girl appointed to the services of Artemis Brauronia was called dpKToç, 'bear'; in Semonides 7 women's flaws are likened to as many animals; in Alcman's fr. 1, a partheneion where the choir of unmarried girls is defined a 'herd' (47, kv (3otoÍç), with the girl Agido a 'robust horse' (47-48 lttttoi&gt; I nayov; see 59 and 92) animal imagery is recurring. Agido and Hagesichora are likened to doves (60, T'€'r'áòeç - there is discussion on this line - according to some Pleiads could be a rival choir, or the star-group), birds sacred to Aphrodite and connected to the erotic meaning of the song; they are said to be fighting (63, páxovTai) against the other girls who are excluded by them and left 'screeching pointlessly' like 'an owl from a rafter' (86-87, '±&amp;tclv dirò öpdvo) XéXaica / yXaúf). Finally, at 101 the girls' song is compared to that of a swan, kúkvoç (see Gigante Lanzara 2003 for an overview of the usage of bird imagery in Greek poetry). What is striking in the Bacchae is not the usage of animal imagery in itself but the combination of the two levels, the literal and the figurative. 110 For example, we may quote the episode of the dog Argos in Od. XVII, 291-327 or, with reference to a miraculous context but still within a literal presentation, the final lines of hHom. VII (44-54), where the captive Dionysus turns himself into a lion before the eyes of the sailors who have imprisoned him (44, Xéuv yévçj '), and who are, in tum, transformed into dolphins (53, ÔeX^Iveç 6 ' èyévovTo).</page><page sequence="141">132 HIDDEN PATHS representative of the human activity of rearing animals and an actual victim of sparagmos (in the herdsman's narrative). In addition to these references to particular species, there are also general terms used for animals in the play, and extensive instances of the vocabulary of rearing and hunting. In both cases, literal and figurative are co-present, but now with the figurative dominant. The words used for wild animal in general (also meaning 'booty', 'prey') are aypa, (with derivatives dypio? and dypcoTT]?, 'savage'), and 0f|p. Notwithstanding the presence of actual animals in the play, the terms usually refer to something else, to Dionysus but mainly to Pentheus.111 This effective open-endedness in the demarcation between man and animal and between figurative and literal engenders a complication in the overall motif of hunting and animal-rearing. Among the chief human activities, these two involve the main characters as hunter and hunted, breeder and bred. This second sphere is less in evidence, but still significant: Dionysus describes Pentheus as 'feeding on hope' (èXmcriv 8 ' eßocnccTo) at 617 and 'kicking against the goad' (līpos Kévrpa Xaicriíeiv, expression appropriate for horses or oxen) at 795, and leads him as a bull leads the cattle (1 159); the women raise or tend the wild animals (700) - but butcher the cattle (737-45); Pentheus tries to confine the stranger in the stable (509-10), and attacks a bull (618-19); Agave too leads them like a pack of hounds (731; cf. also 689-90, 1092-94, 112 1114113). In some cases, even if no animal association is made explicit, the same pattern seems superimposable: Dionysus 'will easily lead' Cadmus and Tiresias to the mountain at 194; the thiasos/àyé'r' is led on the mountains by the god, who plays the role of hound-master (1022-23). Hunting is more in evidence than rearing, again in a mixture of roles. The terms involved are dypewo, 'I hunt' (dypeupa, 'booty', 'spoil' and àypeuç, 'hunter'), 0ripáGü/0TipeíJü), 'I hunt' (euGripoç, 'lucky in the chase', 0r|payp€inT|s' 'hunter', 0f)pa, 'a hunting', 'the chase'); to the same group also belong Kwr|yéTr|s' 'hunter' (Kwrjyia, 'hunt', 'chase'; ÇuyKwayóç, 'fellow-hunter'; kucov, 'hound'), and instances of verbs of catching, articulating the drive to chase and capture which urges Pentheus and other male characters, like the herdsmen. Some significant instances of the common verb Xapßczvüj, and of àpnd£oj (owapTraCod), pápTTTCü, all three 'I catch', as well as 4&gt;eúyco, 'I flee' (cf&gt;uyri, 'flight') are pertinent here. The dyp- group involves first of all Agave. We have dypedaj at 1204, 'come and see the prey we have hunted'; 'the hunting of wild animals!' at 1237; dypeupa, 'exulting in my hunting' at 1241. Dionysus is defined as dva£ àypeúç, 'lord hunter' by the chorus at 1 192; the chorus call themselves hunters at 138-39 ('hunting goat-killing blood', aypeucov 111 aypa: 8 occurrences, 1 referring to snakes (102), 1 to Dionysus (434) and 6 to Pentheus (at 1 146 and 1 199, meaning literally 'hunt', but with Pentheus as a prey; 1 183, 1 196, 1 199, 1201, 1203). aypLoç refers to wolves (700), once to Harmonia's metamorphosis (1358), and to Pentheus (361). à-ypiamós' refers to Pentheus (542). áyptóaTas' (àyptíxjTas' Blaydes; àypwTas' LP) refers to Orpheus' creatures (564). 0f|p: 1 2 occurrences, referring 3 times to animals (564, with Orpheus; 727, beasts running in the Bacchanal; 1085, silent before the sparagmos ), twice to Dionysus (436, 922) and 6 times to Pentheus again (1 108, 1 183, 1 190, 1204, 1210, 1237); OipÓTpo^oç twice refers to the thiasoi of the Bacchants (102, 556-57). 1,2 1091 deleted by Paley; 1091-92 by Diggle. 113 Only at 731 is Agave presented as leading dogs; in the other lines cited, however, she displays the same master-like attitude towards the other women.</page><page sequence="142">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 133 I aípa TpayoKTÓvov). The first servant returns from his mission 'having hunted the prey' - the stranger - at 434, dypav f|ypeuKÓT£ç.114 Terms with the root Gr)p- are used more often.115 Again, the character most associated with such usage is Agave. We get Gipáto at 732, 'we are hunted by these men'; at 1215, 'the lion I have hunted', and at 1278, 'a lion, as my fellow-hunters say', referring to her companions. 0f)pa is used to refer to her deeds by the second servant at 1 144, 'rejoicing in her ill-fated hunt' (Gipa ôuaTTÔTpœ) and at 1171 she calls hers a 'blessed hunt' (paicapiav Gf|pav). Pentheus is connected to this group of terms at 228 ('I will hunt them from the mountains'), and at 459, where he accuses Dionysus of 'hunting Aphrodite with your beauty' (echoed at 688 by the herdsman: the women were not, as the king thought, 'hunting Aphrodite in the wood'). At 839 Dionysus suggests to the king that to spy is 'wiser than to hunt down evils with evils', KdKOÍç Gfļpav kclkó. At 1253 Agave ironically wishes Pentheus was as euGipoç, 'a good hunter' as she is, when he hunts on the mountains (Gipûv, at 1255). Finally, the chorus at 869 recall the image of the hunted fawns; at 890 they claim that gods 'hunt down the impious' (Grpakjn; tòv daeTTTOv); at 1005-06 they rejoice in hunting (xcdpo) Grpetioulaa), and at 1020 (it may be) they call Dionysus 0r|paypeuTf|Ç, 'hunter'.116 The group with the ku- stem again centres on hunting.117 The chorus at 872 use a negative piece of imagery, 'the running of the hounds' hunting a fawn (8pdp.r|pa kwwv); at 977 they call the Maenads Avovaç kwéç, 'hounds of frenzy'; Dionysus is called KwayéTaç, 'hunter' at 871, and 'fellow hunter' at 1146, Çuyicwdyóç and l;vv€pyáTr)v dypds*. Agave at 731 calls her fellow-hunters 'running hounds'; the episode of Actaeon is repeatedly recalled.118 Finally, other terms add to the dynamic of hunting: dpndCco and awapTra£co, ('I catch') used at 443 for Pentheus ('the women you took away', auvripTTdadS', says the first servant), at 729 for the herdsman ('I jumped out with the aim of seizing her', coç auvdpTTdcJdi GeXcov), and at 754 for the women ('they seized children from their homes', fļpTTdCov '±€v €K Sópcuv T6KVd). Then we have instances of Xafißdveiv used in the specific sense of 'catch' or 'capture', mainly with reference to Pentheus (in his own words at 226, 'as many women as I have caught'; at 239, 'if I capture him [the stranger] within this land'; at 355, 'if you catch him, bring him here', and in Dionysus' words addressing the king at 960, 'you will catch them, if you are not caught first'. At 1102, Pentheus is 1,4 àypcúto, 'I hunt' is used once by the chorus (138), once by the first servant (434) and twice by Agave (1204, 1237). dypeupa, 'hunting' is used by Agave at 1241; àypeùç, 'hunter' is used to refer to Dionysus (1 192). 1,5 0r)páü)/0T)pcúü) ('1 hunt') is used 10 times, by Pentheus (228, 459), the herdsman (688, 719), Agave (732, 1215, 1278), Dionysus (839) and the chorus (890, 1005-06). 0f|pa ('hunt') recurs in imagery (869), or in connection with Agave's killing of her son (1 144, 1 171); euOqpos' ('good at hunting') is used by Agave (1253). 116 Text controversial: cod. here Oqpayporra/ÓTa. Dindorf suggested OqpaypcuTâ. Other proposed readings include 0f)p OqpaypéTçi (Tyrrell, commended by Dodds) and 0f)p áypeirrâ (Kopff, Seaford, Diggle), all with the same effect: the dative term would depend on ttcoovtl (1022-23) making the hunted 0f)p hunt the hunter Pentheus. However, it is true that the king has already changed from pursuer to quarry: perhaps P's Oripayporra should be retained as a vocative to modify Bdicxc, as suggested by Neuburg (1987b). 1,7 KwayéTaç, 'hunter' (871, 1189); Kwayia, 'hunt' (339); ÇuyKwayós1, 'fellow hunter' is used to refer to Dionysus (1 146); KÚan&gt;, 'hound' (731, 872, 977, 1291). 1,8 See below p. 166, with n. 13.</page><page sequence="143">134 HIDDEN PATHS finally trapped, cnropia XeXrippivos* ('caught in helplessness'). There are also references to Agave in her proud hallucination at 1196, 'having caught a prey', at 1239, 'the prize I took for valour'. pdpTTTco, 'I seize' is also used by Agave at 1173, 'I seized without meshes...'.119 The counterpart to these verbs of catching is offered by c^eúyco, 'I flee' and (¡&gt;uyf), 'flight'.120 Words from this group are used ironically by Dionysus at 627, 'on the assumption that I had got away', referring to Pentheus' belief; at 659, when the god reassures him that 'we will not try to get away'; at 792, when Pentheus tells the god 'as you have escaped from bonds, will you not stop instructing me?'; at 437, in the first servant's narrative, 'he did not pull back his foot in flight'; at 798, as Dionysus warns the king 'you will all be put to flight'; at 734 and 763, when the herdsman tells how the women turned the men to flight. The term is present in a positive sense in the fawn image offered by the chorus at 868. Finally, at 1350 and 1363, in Agave's mouth, &lt;f&gt;iryf| and favyoj allude to exile. This list reveals an important aspect of the motif in Bacchae , which is the usage of key-words within a problematization of the image itself. The idea of hunting and escaping shifts from a positive to a negative; the role of hunter and hunted, the value of exile and salvation, and the status of man and animal are ambiguous too. In addition to a presentation of Pentheus as persecutor against the victimized god, we have a diffuse image of hunting and fleeing which involves all characters. With the traditional stability of the world denied, the crucial effect for characterization is that the individual remains a closed and impenetrable actor, misfit within a hunt which becomes a figure for an incomprehensible reality. At the beginning of the play, Pentheus is presented as the bold, aggressive party in his struggle with Dionysus. Terminology of tying, binding and imprisoning also characterizes the behaviour of the king - superficially but insistently - and, at a deeper level, Dionysus' action. Some of the terms for 'tying', in particular dpKuç, 'net', uttered by Pentheus twice and by the chorus (at 231, 451, 870), are connected to the motif of hunting as well.121 Pentheus and most of the other human characters - servants, stranger, Agave, chorus - all carry out, or at least try to carry out, an actual hunt: Pentheus, in his obsessively tyrannical fashion, through hopeless military means, while the women do it proudly without weapons or nets (736; 757;122 1128; 1173; 1205-10). 123 However, all three hunts are unsuccessful: Pentheus does not catch the women nor does he actually take hold of the stranger; the herdsman and the other men try in vain to seize Agave and the other Maenads; Agave herself and her companions, although they manage to catch their prey, finally accomplish a denial of the very function of hunting: they first kill 'a well-uddered 1 19 Xapßdvw and other verbs with the meaning 'to catch' (I cite only the instances where the verb is connected to hunting/catching a victim: 226, 239, 355, 503 (XdCopcu), 960 (twice), 1 102, 1 125, 1 140, 1 196, 1221 - deleted by Nauck-1239); dpTTd£(o (754), awap7Td£io (443, 729), pdpTTTw (1 173). 120 4&gt;evy co, 'I flee', (627, 659, 734, 792, 798, 868, 1363); &lt;t&gt;vyr¡, 'flight'(437, 763, 1350). 121 Cf.

Yet Pentheus, Agave and the Maenads, as well as Dionysus, are hunted at the same time - just as the chorus are both victimized and claim to 'rejoice in hunting':124 the women and the chorus are chased by Pentheus, and Pentheus by them, but in fact, implicitly, by Dionysus through them. It is useful to distinguish between different types of hunting and different models of hunter to assess the significance of the motif to qualify our characters, especially Pentheus. We should note that the sparagmos scene (1043-152) and its preparation in the fourth stasimon (977-1023) point, in part, to the hunting of small animals, like (for instance) the hare-hunting which is evoked with reference to Pentheus at Aeschylus' Eumênides 26: Xayœ SiKTļv TTevGet KaTappcz^aç piópov, 'scheming a death for Pentheus like a hare's'. The nature of this hunt is different in practice and social meaning from the more dangerous and rewarding hunt of bigger animals, like boars, and deserves our attention.125 Kerenyi, interpreting a presentation of a hunting god on a Roman sarcophagus, identifies it as a Dionysus carrying a pedum , a stick, and a net, precisely the tools used to chase the hare.126 His observations on older presentations of the god as hunter are useful for our reading of the hunt-motif in Bacchae, Hare-hunting is not one of the heroic hunts celebrated in Greek culture as offering men a chance to prove their courage. It is, rather, a non-risky, everyday form of hunt. Its presence in Dionysiac iconography is linked, according to Kerenyi, to the symbolic role of the hare in a number of rites of passage for youths; hare-hunting has strong connotations of pre-adulthood.127 I propose that in Bacchae this reference to hare-hunting and these connotations are activated. The characteristics identified as typical of pre-adult hunting are present in Bacchae' s allusion to the motif, but they do not concern one character in particular - Pentheus, as one might expect - but the activity in itself. The characteristics in question are precisely those that are rejected in Greek culture for mature hunting: Plato reflects on the activity of hunting at Laws 7.822d-824a, and heavily condemns the use of net and traps; at 824a, he says that 'of this branch of hunting, the kind called night-stalking, which is the job of lazy men who sleep in turn, is one that deserves no praise'. This hunting typifies the adolescent: it is carried out avev cri8f|pou, 'without weapons', and by means of aTrcmr) ('trickery').128 In Bacchae the elements of ritual hunt as rite of passage for adolescents are present, but fractured among different characters. Dionysus is ¿¡iryKuvayóç (1146) and KuvayéTaç 124 Cf. 1005-06, and the whole fourth stasimon (977-1023). 125 On hare hunting in ancient Greece see Hull (1964) 59-75; Anderson (1985) 31-32. 126 Kerenyi (1952). 127 Kerenyi (1952) 137. See also Anderson (1985) 70 on the depictions of young men hunting hares on fifth- century Attic funerary vases, and extensively Vidal-Naquet (1968) and his analysis of the relation between the Athenian ephebia and ritual hunting. 128 qttoitt) is an element of great importance likewise in the Spartan Kryptia : see Vernant (2000) 151-86. Cf. also Barringer (2001) 55: 'this quality of deception, of ignoble sportsmanship, of reliance on cleverness or a ruse rather than on physical prowess and courage is inherent to the immature hunt' .</page><page sequence="145">136 HIDDEN PATHS (1189), the hound-leader who urges the hounds to chase the prey into the net;129 the god pursues his prey through àmÍTri, trickery rather than by violence, a strategy he also commends to Pentheus (at 839, spying on the women from a hidden place is 'wiser than hunting down evils with evils'). The god here is the shrewd, fraudulent hunter as opposed to the adult, heroic hunter. Yet other characters share these attributes: the women hunt without the need of iron weapons, as noted above;130 nocturnal activity is one of Pentheus' complaints against the stranger, which the latter readily confirms (485-86). Pentheus, for his part, is handed over to the women by Dionysus, at 848, with the words, avfļp èç ßoXov KaGiaTctTcu ('the man is being brought into the net'), in preparation for the àycay, the 'contest', the 'trial' which this 'young man' must endure (974-75). On the other side, Pentheus himself tries to pursue his prey (the women) by means of secrecy and tricks. At 869-70, in the fawn image, the Maenads recall another hunting-situation (here in an explicitly negative sense), as they long to escape e£oo cfrvXaKâç I éùttXéktgûv ÚTTèp àpKÚcov, 'beyond the guard, over the well- wo ven nets', where (J&gt;uXaKf| is literally the net watcher.131 The chorus praise their lord, leader of the hounds, who has cast the trap around Pentheus (ßpoxoy, at 1021, and already ßöXov, at 848), 132 and who has led him towards the women, vtt ' àyéXav, 'the herd [of Maenads]' (1022). The women, for their part, behave like hounds: first, they are roused by their master, at 1078; they lift their head nervously, almost as sniffing the air, at 1086-87; then they are commanded to surround the prey, at 1 106. In summary, we have in Bacchae various allusions to the hunting domain, and amongst them a pattern of nocturnal, adolescent, ritual hunting. This pre-adult, sacred hunt does not reach its constructive aim. The prey is torn apart, its remains are scattered in the forest, its head is carried around. Whatever our reading for the scene - hunting, sacr- ifice, or both - we have here a failed hunt and a failed sacrifice. Both Pentheus and the god present 'ephebic' characteristics: ironically in the case of Dionysus, and in an abortive manner in the case of the king. And where Pentheus is concerned, this implicit reference to the rituals of the adolescent who must reach adulthood serves not to point to the definition of a character - contrast Hippolytus, for instance - but to disturb a surface hiding unspeakable aspects of the character's inner life. 129 See also 1089, where the daughters of Cadmus hear the KeXeuapóç, the 'order' of the god and hurl themselves at the prey, and 1078, where the voice of the god-leader rouses the women (4&gt;covr| tis*, 'a voice...'). No animal is mentioned here, but the behaviour of both the god and the women is suggestive of the hunt. 130 At 949-50 we have an involuntary parody of this in Pentheus' boast: poxXoùç &lt;J&gt;ép(0|iev T' XÉpdív àvaoTraao) Kopušais* inToßaXcov ¿opov Tļ ßpaxtova; Should we take levers? Or should I tear him up with my hands, putting my shoulder or arm beneath the peaks? 131 The reference is perhaps to a hunting practice where the hunter is armed with a throwing-stick and cord (see Anderson 1985,41). 132 The word ßpoxos, 'noose' recurs at 545, where the chorus fear that Pentheus may have trapped the stranger in one; at 619, where Pentheus tries to use one against the bull, thinking it is the stranger; finally, at 1 173 where Agave boasts that she had managed to catch the iion' without one.</page><page sequence="146">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF* 1 37 One might indeed object that Tailed ephebť - what Vidal Naquet called 'black hunters'133 - are not a novelty in tragic representations: the Euripidean Hippolytus is one of many examples. Yet there are fundamental differences between the two.134 First of all, in Bacchae we do not have one character representing a failure of ephebia , but, as indicated, elements of pre-adult hunting shared, sometimes parodically, between different characters; secondly, unlike Hippolytus, the young Pentheus is no ephebe , but an established king; thirdly, in Hippolytus we have a decisive closure to the ritual pattern, marked by Artemis' blessing and the painful understanding of Theseus. In this respect, the lesson' of our play seems to be left open. Dionysus, for his part, enters the action of the play as a victim and a prisoner, under threat of being hunted down, and heading a group of outcast women. Through the appeals of the chorus, however, his status as KuvTjyéTrjç, 'hunter' becomes gradually apparent, whereas the hunter Pentheus is presented (and, above all, dressed) in a way which ridicules and denies his ambitions as hunter,135 is led into the net by the god, and duly chased by the hounds. The god's eventual role as both the bull leader of the cattle and the Kui/Tì-yéTris* leading the hunt is all too clear. How does this manipulation of categories impinge on the flawed relationship between man and cosmos in Bacchael In three ways: first, the cultural category of the 'animal' is seen to be neither clearly opposed to nor integrated with man; secondly, there is a challenge to the status of basic civilized activities such as rearing and hunting; thirdly, there is a crisis concerning the values and the educational functions of 'social survival' that hunting in particular carries for Greek society.136 Within this crisis the parameters for the hunter are turned upside-down: the ultimate hunters are women and a feminine- looking stranger, while the self-styled dominating character, Pentheus, becomes the sacrificial victim or prey.137 This dynamic of reversals has been noted by many scholars, 133 Vidal-Naquet (1968) 63. 134 Contrast Bellinger (1939) 26-27, who underlines the similarities between the two plays and finds in the two protagonists an 'obvious likeness'. Barringer also ignores the differences between the two, aligning the Aeschylean Orestes, Hippolytus and Pentheus as examples of 'black hunters' (Barringer 2001, 55). 135 See Xenophon's recommendation about the hunters' dress: 'let the net-keeper wear light clothing when he goes hunting' ( Cyn 6.5); 'let the huntsman go out to the hunting-ground in a simple light dress and shoes, carrying a cudgel in his hand, and let the net-keeper follow' (6. 1 1 ). Pentheus, dressed as a Maenad, accompanied by Dionysus and the servant, and brandishing the thyrsus , is a parody of a hunter holding his Xa-yajßoXov, his 'staff (for flinging at hares)', it is difficult to separate traditional mythological elements from poetic invention in our play; however, the emphasis on Agave as main agent of destruction and, most of all, the presentation of an unarmed Pentheus seem to be Euripidean innovations. Pace Sedgwick (1930) 6, Webster (1967) 268-69 argued, on the evidence of vase paintings, for the novelty of Pentheus' killing by Agave, followed by McKay (1970), and Oranje (1984) 130, who pronounces 'the god driving his adversary mad [as] Euripides' most important innovation'. See more extensively March (1989), who sees Pentheus' madness, woman's dress, and death at his mother's hands as Euripidean innovations. 136 See e.g. Anderson (1985) 17-20; both Xenophon (Cyn. 12.1-8) and Plato ( Lg . 822d-24) assert the important role of hunting in the formation of the young man and citizen. 'Social survival' is emphasized by Barringer (2001), esp. 10-69. 137 We shall not forget hunting as symbolic protection of the community by the king. Cf. Anderson (1985) 70 on Atys' story in Herodotus (1, 34-45): 'the concept of the king as protector of his people against the beasts of the wilderness was widely held and long remembered', and Di Benedetto (2004) 462 for more comparable examples.

Dionysus is Semele's son, therefore Pentheus' cousin and the Agave's nephew; he is also Zeus' son. This condition places him both inside the royal oIkoç, the royal family and outside it, in the sphere of the Olympian divinities.142 Pentheus is Agave's son and Cadmus' nephew, therefore deeply linked to the roots of the city of Thebes itself. His father is Echion, a descendent of the sown men; his chthonic affinity opposes him to the Olympian world that Dionysus claims to belong to, and is readily associated with monstrous powers.143 At the means 'throw the mane back', 'rear up (and throw the rider)' (dvá, Pentheus is riding a tree's i^íotoiç (1074). 1064-67 are lines of particularly difficult interpretation (see Dodds 1960, 210-11); £XiKo8pó|2ov is Reiske's correction for £Xicei 8pópov P. The main corrections/interpretations for the simile lead either to a reading allusive of a technique whereby a wheel is circumscribed by a peg and a line (Diggle 1998), or to a translation of TÓpvoç (1067) as 'lathe' in which a convex wheel is chiselled, reading therefore yXa&lt;f&gt;óp.evoç instead of ypa&lt;f&gt;ó|ievoç at 1067 (Rijksbaron 1991, 138-43; 1999). Bonger (2002) retains £Xkéi Ôpópov, and proposes that Dionysus is acting as a 'torsion-engine', and translates 1066-68 thus: 'he bent it over as the bow or the rimmed wheel I in the lathe, describing its rotation, gathers gear' - an interpretation that suits the dynamism implied by the use of àvaxaiTiCo) with reference to the tree. Stieber (2006) compares these verses with Homeric passages where references to the building of wooden chariot wheels are found (II. V, 722-26; II. 4, 482-86), and translates as follows (588): '[the tree] was bent into a curve just as a bow or the convex rim of a wheel formed (ypa^ópevoç) on a circular mold (TÓpvio) as to the course of its circumference (ttc pi&lt;J&gt;opàv é"Xiico8pópov)'. nx E.g. Vidal-Naquet (1968) 56-57; Hoffman (1989); Goldhill (1988); Segal (1997a) 158-214; Lada-Richards (1999) 60-68. 139 Barringer (2001) Chapter 3 ('Hunting and myth'), esp. 156-61. See Di Benedetto (2004) 394. 140 The special importance of family/gender issues in Bacchae is acknowledged by Zeitlin (1986) 112 ('the play directly poses a confrontation between mother and son and more openly dramatizes the dilemma of a self as a family member') and Gould (1987b), who suggests that Bacchae can be read as a play 'about women and about mothers' (32), where 'the idea of growth and fertility [is connected] in its widest sense with images of violence and destruction' (34). 141 See, above all, Glaucus and Diomedes in II VI. 119-236: before the duel the two heroes discover that their families share an ancient relation of hospitality, ÇeiAa, and decide to abandon the combat and even avoid any conflict in the future. 142 See Halleran (1990) 41 1-12. 143 E.g. Ba. 538-44 and 1 155. See Segal's analysis of this familial connection (1997a, 129 and n. 10; 138-40, 171-73, 177-80, 186).</page><page sequence="148">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 39 same time, Pentheus refers to Cadmus, the sower of Thebans, as his surrogate father, just as at the end of the play Cadmus would think of him as playing the protective role that is a son's duty (1310-22). The whole city of Thebes shares Pentheus' chthonic origins, being the descendants of Cadmus' sown men. Segal has commented extensively on these relations,144 using (among much else) psychoanalytic models to read Pentheus' relationships with the mother, the father-figure and the female world, and taking these elements as working towards a portrayal of a 'failed rite of passage' whereby the king fails to become an adult male. Not much could be added to Segal's analysis from a formal point of view, but it is worth concentrating on how the flawed relationships in Bacchae described by Segal involve a wide range of characters, just as with the hunting theme; they are not exclusive to one critical 'item', unlike in the cases of Oedipus and Jocasta in the Sophoclean play or Hippolytus and Phaedra in the Hippolytus. Contrast 07, the commonplace paradigm for psychoanalytic constructions. In OT we have a city under monstrous threat, which Oedipus liberates by solving the riddle of the Sphinx, and turns it into a normal, stable place. When another sign of disequilibrium shows (sterility and plague), the quest for responsibility begins; it is found in the patricide and incest committed by the king, and the guilty one is expelled. Of course, the audience knows that Thebes has not gone back to being the normal city it was before Laius' death, for the myth continues with the slaughter caused by Eteocles' and Polynices' fight, and with Antigone's sacrifice. However, in the Sophoclean re-elaboration of the saga a constructive movement is detectable, and the 'exception' of Oedipus' fault 'confirms the rule'; there are also voices that speak for the city (the chorus and Tiresias). In Bacchae we are not allowed to isolate the problem in this way: there is no one flawed character against a 'healthy background'. The disorder in the city of Thebes is so deeply interwoven with characterization that if we subtract it we have to subtract the characters altogether, and we are left with a city without regency, or chiefs, or religious awareness, almost without the stuff of events themselves. In particular, none of the main characters in the play acts according to his or her position within the family, or ends up in it; Tiresias, with his silent disappearance after the first scene, is no exception.145 Cadmus is the least eccentric as a family-figure, ironically enough as he is the first who, by his own choice, is shown as comically misplaced - dressed as a Maenad, at the beginning of the play. He has a special concern for his family's good (334-36), and mourns Pentheus as if he were his own son (1302-26). He behaves like a grandfather to him, as well as a father (he has given him power over Thebes, at 213), still within a role of family-chief . Agave provides a unique instance of behaviour that contradicts the status of a mother, not primarily by killing her son (Clytemnestra would have happily done so in Choephori , for instance), but by not recognizing him and dismissing his hunting abilities. Pentheus, notwithstanding psychoanalytic readings of the play which argue for a 'morbid attachment to the mother',146 shows a detachment from all his relatives.147 He is aggressive towards 144 Segal (1978). 145 See Di Benedetto (2004) 308 on the 'removal' of Tiresias from the play as 'concomitant with a disturbing loss of identity' (my translation). 146 This attachment is usually argued on the grounds of lines 966-69:</page><page sequence="149">140 HIDDEN PATHS Cadmus, and dismissive and offensive, in the third person, towards his mother;148 he has of course no wife or children.149 His father Echion, even though acknowledged (507), is not present at any personal level. Dionysus, for his part, begins by expressing a striking concern for Semele's good name (41), but in the course of the play drops his mortal-like filial feelings to reveal a distant and incomprehensible divine nature. At the end of the play familial equilibrium is only partially restored, in the moving Agave-Cadmus scene; Pentheus' mother regresses to a daughter-status, without ever re- appropriating her role as an adult woman, while her father cannot play any protective role for her, as he admits: o ùk olôa, rewov apiKpòç èmKoupoç TTcmļp, 'I do not know, child. Your father is a small helper' (1367). 150 However, even this intimacy lasts only for a moment: Cadmus will be transformed into a snake, and Agave will wander off into exile. As we have seen with other domains (manfàeast, the visible world), a firm framing is questioned, if not denied. The principles of parenthood and family are no longer an instrument to reinforce identity, but become themselves the object of distortion, which affects characterization by concealing identity rather than revealing it. As the play develops, the 'palace-hero equation', a typical device of the tragic genre , becomes paramount: the destruction of Pentheus and that of the oIkoç, the royal family, are contiguous.

Modern critics have tended to acknowledge, alternatively, either the psychologically articulated representation of Pentheus in the play, or the 'a-morphic' depiction of the world, by way of a compulsion to connect the first to a firm vision of reality (psychoanalytic theory, for which Pentheus is the misfit individual in an ordered society), and the second to an elusive depiction of the king's character, merely functional to the events of the play. The connection between the two is the other way round; the setting of the play might indeed only allow Pentheus to be 'an amorphous organism susceptible to all influences' (Rosenmeyer 1968, 170); but this does prompt a more articulate representation of the man, rather than a lack of interest in character. 147 Euben (1990) 143: 'Pentheus becomes morally and politically isolated ... he distances himself from others by pushing them away'. 148 E.g. at 229, when he names Agave among the women he plans to hunt down and lock up. 149 Cf. Flaumenhaft (1994) 64: 'Without mother, father, or friends, he looks and acts alone... Pentheus, like most tyrants, is out of touch. His grandfather has abdicated to him, and there is no council of advisors . . . even the feeble chorus of elders, which provides a sort of public perspective in some plays, is absent here'; and Gould (1987b) 37: 'emptiness is a recurring feature in the world of Bacchae ... above all an emptiness of the male ... There are no adult males, no fathers, only the old and inadequate, and the young and inexperienced'. 150 Despite the considerable number of lines missing at the end of the play, we can see that her behaviour in the closing lines is still the behaviour of a helpless daughter, rather than an adult mother. Di Benedetto advances that Cadmus' words might be the 'a sign of crisis in a culture where the father figure had a pivotal role' (2004, 489).</page><page sequence="150">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 141 Pentheus':151 the imprisonment of Dionysus and his destruction of the palace can be seen as the powerful enactment of the god being within the man. Such a modality has often been linked to the notion of tragedy as a genre which opposes yévoç, family and ttóXiç: in the strongest formulation of this view, tragedy is a Dionysiac pattern repeating itself, and opposing the democratic city to the family.152 For some plays this pattern works better than for others; for Bacchae in particular - which is the most literally 'Dionysiac' tragedy we know of - this ttóXiç/oIkoç opposition becomes inconclusive and meaningless. Pentheus treats his city as if it were his oTkoç (by giving orders and being concerned with morality), and his oikoç as if it were a city (with coldness and distance),153 Neither of the two seems to be a positive reality, a place worthy of being preserved as it stands, in which man has a defined role. This undermining of the importance of family in man's self-definition is achieved despite, or perhaps even because of, a verbal emphasis on parental and familial relations:154 mother (Agave mainly, and Semeie); father (Cadmus, Echion and Zeus), son or daughter (Pentheus, Dionysus, Agave), wife (Agave).155 These terms recur frequently, leaving the impression of a huge family-drama: in fact, the whole story takes place between people who belong to the same family, whether knowingly or unknowingly.156 151 Wohlberg (1968) 152. 152 See below III.4.3, pp. 155-57. 153 Leinieks (1996) 243 reads Pentheus' opening line at 215 (^ôr^oç ûv pèv TfjaÔ ' èrvyxavov xôovóç, 'I happened to be absent from this land') as expressing political estrangement (eicôripoç means 'out of the country', but also, etymologically, 'apart from the people'). True, the absence of the king from the city is a stock tragic motif. Yet, van der Stockt (1999) 170 is right to note the emphasis on the vcxjtos, the return of the king at his first appearance, and on his previous absence from the city, and his insistence on the new things that have happened while he was away: v€ox|ià...KCUcá, 'new evils' at 216, tòv vcoxjtI Saiļiova, 'the new god' at 219 and likewise tòv ôaípov ' ...véov at 256 and vóoov | KaiW|i&gt;, 'a new disease' at 353-54. 154 From this point of view, as from others, Bacchae seems different from other tragedies: as Griffith (1998) argues, tragedy seems in general to 'reassert a patriarchal norm that is deeply familiar and traditional' (77), the rule of the father/king, towards which the Greeks had simultaneous feelings of fascination and repulsion, as they did for the tyrants and aristocratic rulers who are the protagonists of tragedy. Fathers in tragedy 'loom very largely, but mainly in absentia ' (33) (on father-figures and mother-figures in Bacchae see also Glenn 1979). 155 Motherhood: 2, 9, 26, 41, 91-92, 230 (229-30 deleted by Coliman), 250, 682, 689, 720, 858, 926, 966, 969, 998, 1092 (1091 deleted by Paley, and 1092 deleted by Diggle and heavily suspected by Dodds, see Dodds 1960, lvii) 1114, 1118, 1120, 1140, 1195, 1253, 1275, 1319, 1324.

In particular, in Euripides we find the model of 'Odyssean recognition' as opposed to 'Oedipal recognition', in the classification offered by Cave (1990, 224ff.). Odyssean recognition results in the recovery of wife and property, whilst the Oedipal leads to the loss of kinship lines. The first model will become paramount in New Comedy (where the plot is often shaped by characters' discovery that they belong to the same family, as, e.g., in Menander's Epitrepontes, Perikeiromene, Samia), with the movement from estrangement and disorder to some sort of intimacy and private order. Bacchae clearly falls under the second heading. However, in other plays where events unfold within one family, and follow the negative pattern (e.g. OT, Choephori ) an objectifying presence is there to represent the polis. In our play there is a failure of family and a complete absence of a public witness and judge.</page><page sequence="151">142 HIDDEN PATHS We have in the play two formal instances of familial anagnorisis : at 507 with Pentheus, and at 1274-76 with Agave. In the first instance the king answers the god's claim, 'you do not know who you are', with the words: TT€v0eus' ' Ayaufjç Traíç, TTaTpòç S ' 'Exlovos* ('Pentheus, the son of Agave, and of my father Echion'), in which the god finds a suitable omen. The king refers to two elements (apart from his own name, on which Dionysus constructs a word-play):157 his father Echion (chthonic and absent figure), and Agave, a mother who will be everything except a mother to him throughout the play. In the second instance, the 'psychotherapy scene' at 1274-76, Agave starts to regain her sanity by remembering she is wife to ZmipTíp... 'Ex'lovl ('Echion, the Sown man'), and mother of Pentheus, whose head she has in her hands.158 Family recognition here is clearly a superficial and non-constructive element: Agave recognizes her son only after his death. Pentheus, likewise, will never recognize Dionysus as a god, nor as his cousin (even though his first direct question to him, at 460, is the traditional TTpcoTOv pèv ow poi 'é£ov ooTiç et yevoç, 'first tell me who you are, from what family'). Dionysus is the only one to know it all from the beginning, but he does not behave as a family member in any way, not even by maintaining his loyalty to his mother Semeie.159 In this play, family has not replaced ttóXiç as it will to some extent in Menander, but is equivalent to it in a discouraging and destructive isolation, whereby to be a son, or a mother, a king or a citizen, is no longer a guarantee of meaning. Familial issues are linked to gender identity. Social and anthropological studies, psychoanalytic studies, and feminist criticism in particular, have found in gender- oppositions one of the shaping features of the tragic genre.160 On this aspect of tragedy much has been said, particularly in reference to Bacchae ;161 some of the resultant readings, however, are deeply misleading. One instance may suffice, Evans' The God of Ecstasy. Sex Roles and the Madness of Dionysus. 162 The author is especially concerned with the figures of Dionysus and Pentheus in Bacchae in their relation with male- dominated Athenian society. Dionysus, with his feminine attributes and subversive attitude as a male, and Pentheus, with his self-styled masculinity and contempt for women, express for Evans the drama of a patriarchal society facing a 'god that the patriarchal establishment could neither accept nor eliminate'.163 The opposition in Bacchae is thus between the constituted order personified by Pentheus (and subsuming his repression, temptations, dark sides and natural but rejected homosexuality) and the return to the irrational and the instinctive advocated by the god, whose message in the play is summarized thus: 'you have repressed the sexual and emotional essentials of the old agrarian religion and are ignorant of your own inner self. The price to be paid for this 157 See above, p. 103 n. 228. 158 The 'anticipation ironique' between the two passages is noted by McDonald (1992) 232. 159 Cf.

On the given interpretation, Dionysus is an omniscient presence punishing Pentheus for all he represents, and the individual and the world - 'you and your civilization' - are two separate spheres, with the second (the world) being created and univocally influenced by the first (the psychological subject). Dionysus, in this frame, is external to and challenges both. Such a representation of reality - man + world + god - is false for Greek tragedy and false, in particular, for Bacchae (and, one may add, is generally inadequate). In Bacchae , Dionysus and Pentheus belong to the same level and act within the same world of incomprehensible order. It is more appropriate, therefore, to concentrate on the denial of a world-order in the play, and on the consequence of this denial, that an individual's self-definition is made impossible. These two, the denial of a world-order and the consequent difficulty con- cerning man's self-definition, should be considered as if on the same level, rather than investigating scattered details of gender identity in the play separated from their context. In this connection, we may usefully recall Slater's psychoanalytic characterization of the masculine ideal among the Greeks as an ideal of 'narcissism', marked by exhibitionism, vanity and a need for competition.166 Slater explains this as due to the fact that 'the self is conceived as a precarious entity which is difficult but vital to maintain ... an entity that might perish with only one discrepant, unfitting act'.167 This formula makes clear the necessity of considering man's definition within the world context offered by the play, and not in the isolation of an artificial psychoanalytic reading, as many have been tempted to do. Take Agave and the Theban women. Violent maenadic behaviour has been read as a sort of feminist vendetta carried out by women appropriating the 'great achievements of men', like hunting.168 However, the play does not establish a clear-cut dynamic of reversal or self-affirmation. Yes, there is a denial of feminine attributes by Pentheus' mother, who, as a woman, should be at home and humble, and a mother to her son. But, no, her childish, helpless attitude when deranged (1168-99), but also when finally restored to sanity (1363-87) is neither polemical nor constructive, as in the case of a Medea, but still subtracts from the world of the play another important standard of definition, that of social femininity. As often noted, alongside the distinction between woman and man, an almost equally important differentiation among the Greeks is one between young, unmarried women and 164 Evans (1988) 81. 165 An analysis of the play in terms of its developments through later reception, or an investigation of 'the Dionysiac' as thematic force and modern construction, though legitimate and interesting extensions, do not belong to our present consideration for Euripides' text in its unicity. For a stimulating analysis of these itineraries of influence see Fusillo's account of reception of the Bacchae in the twentieth century (Fusillo 2006); on 'Dionysus' as abstract concept see Henrichs (1984a; 1986); Nussbaum (1990). 166 Slater (1974) 23-26. 167 Slater (1974) 25, quoting Gouldner (1965) 43-44, 58, 98. 168 Kraemer (1979) 68; see also Segal (1997a) 192 n. 57.</page><page sequence="153">144 HIDDEN PATHS older, mature women (in psychoanalytic terms linked to the attractive and repulsive figure of the mother). No differentiation of this sort is apparent in Bacchae , where the universality of Dionysus' practice of worship emphatically involves öcrai I ywaiKcç fjciav, 'as many women as there were' (in Dionysus' words, at 35-36). In Pentheus' biased view, (238) they are mainly palatable young girls, vedviaiv, but in reality, as in the more impartial herdsman's report, they are an undifferentiated group: véai TTaXaiai TTap06voi T ' 6T ' áCuyeç, 'young and old women and girls still unmarried' (694). The behaviour of this wide sweep of women would perhaps have seemed as perverse and remote from reality to the Athenian audience as it does to us, even if universalism and inclusiveness were characteristic of Dionysiac worship.169 For the plausibility of this hypothesis - the unorthodoxy of Bacchae' s maenadism - good arguments are offered by vase paintings, as analysed by Keuls.170 She notes how Dionysus' role in fifth-century Athens had a constructive, familial side which we can only fully appreciate through the study of visual art. This role enhanced and promoted marital harmony and concord between the sexes - which explains why Dionysus remained so popular even after a relaxation of sexual behaviour had made his liberating function less urgent.171 An important iconographical convention opposes 'good' women to hetairai , the first enjoying a more 'polite' form of maenadism, rejecting the violent avances of Dionysus' companions, the Satyrs, and the second offering satisfaction to them. This differentiation between married women and hetairai was of the greatest social importance. The maenadism which appears in Bacchae has none of the sexual character of the second group, but reassuringly resembles the 'married women's maenadism'; on the other hand, at intervals it bursts out with the violence of the sparagmos which belongs to myth, but certainly not to any ritual practised in Euripides' time. In sum, Agave and the women hardly offer either confirmation of or evidence against a status quo ; rather, they elude the categories for the definition of women available to the Athenian audience - and, of course, one must include within those available definitions thiasoi of worshippers of the god, unmarried girls, mothers, wives and hetairai}12 m The veracity of maenadism as presented by the play has been widely discussed. Dodds, in both his edition of the play and a pioneering article (Dodds 1940), identifies the women's behaviour with a typical pattern of feminine behaviour on particular occasions such as mourning, among various cultures and in various ages; Bouvrie (1997) goes so far as seeing in the play a confirmation of 'the existence of maenadism as a central polis institution in Athens' (114). A corrective to these assumptions is offered by Henrichs (1982, 1984b; cf. also 1990, 1993). 170 Keuls (1984). 171 Keuls (1984) 289. Besides the marital aspect of the 'harmony' promoted by Dionysus, Dionysiac myth offers us, in different versions, a story of Dionysus and Semeie linked by a strong familial solidarity. The myth, established by the fifth century (see Casadio 1991), has three variant versions: the death of Dionysus and the establishment of his sepulchre at Delphi, where the god will remain active as an oracle; the death of the god and his salvation/resurrection by the hand of Semeie; the death of the mother/Semele and her salvation by the hand of her son/Dionysus. This aspect of Dionysus' persona is significantly suppressed in Bacchae. 172 it is inappropriate to appeal here to a fundamental fluidity in the representation of genders in myth, or indeed in Greek culture. A tragedy, in fact, differs from myth or 'culture' in its unavoidable closure and textual definiteness, within which characters gain significance. On this account alone, Bacchae's unorthodox representation of women cannot be simply reduced to the complexity of the mythological tradition.</page><page sequence="154">CHAPTER 3: THE RELATIONAL SELF' 1 45 Male identities do not come out much better. Pentheus' feminine or ambivalent aspects are unmistakable:173 long hair, taste for dressing-up, hysteria; attachment to the mother (not so much as incestuous lover, but as prospective daughter to Agave);174 no wife or male companions. All the points of reference that could work for his conventional positioning in society are countermanded or ridiculed: his status as a king (a political and military leader); as a son; as a male, as a hunter; as a human, not an animal; as a body.175 Gender-play is only one of the dissonances within this larger disharmony, and it is wrong to identify it as the sole or main source of the broken view of man offered by the play. In gender terms, indeed, Dionysus is presented as emphatically feminine in looks, but more like an adult male in his strength, aggressive determination, efficiency in carrying out his plan, leadership skills and charisma. He is involved in a rite usually performed by women, but himself provides a masculine leading role;176 he shows mildness, tameness and generosity, but also merciless aggressiveness (he can be mild and cruel at the same time, witness 861: Séivótcitoç, àv0pcí)TTOicri 8 ' qmcoTaTosO; he provides food (milk and honey), a typical female task, but is the celebrated patron of wine-production - an exclusively male activity.177 This gender ambiguity is not Euripides' invention, and certainly belongs to the god in mythic and religious tradition; the reflection of this ambiguity in Pentheus, however, is a new element idiosyncratically exploited in our play. Moreover, the emphasis on the god's ambiguity in a play where the role of individual in society is systematically questioned, and the fact that the voice of cosmic order is entrusted to this one divine figure significantly contributes to the denial of the possibility of a defined role for man within a wider whole. 173 Nancy (1984) 134 notes how Pentheus' prejudices against the women on the mountains finally reveal themselves as appropriate to himself: 'l'ironie dramatique a fait son oeuvre: la femme lubrique n'est autre que Penthée que finira, travesti en femme, sauvagement châtié - faut-il dire châtré? - par un juste retour de ses équivoques fantasmes'. 174 Cf. Slater (1974) 22 on the privileged relationship between mother and daughter, or older and younger woman, among the Greeks, and Glenn (1979) 9-10 on Pentheus' 'abnormally close relationship with his mother'. 175 Pentheus is reduced to 'a woman, a child and beast, an amorphous organism susceptible to all influences and realizing itself in a life of instinct and unthinking sense' (Rosenmeyer 1968, 170) 176 The existence of a 'male participant' figure in actual ritual, argued for by Dodds (1940, 170 n. 71 ; 1960, 82- 83) and supported by Evans (1988) 26-28, has been convincingly denied by Henrichs (1984b). Rather, Dionysus' presence among the females worshipping the god is revealed as another element of originality in the play's presentation of male and female characters, and not the enactment of actual ritual practice. 177 See Henrichs (1982) 140-43.</page><page sequence="155">146 HIDDEN PATHS 3.4 Wilderness and the polis Our last instance of the external world which contributes to the 'relational self is the political dimension in the play, or - in terms of character - the portrayal of man as citizen and part of a community. Politicizing readings of tragedy have privileged Bacchae as a field of inquiry, for a variety of reasons. First, the political power epitomized by Pentheus is a central element in the play. This is not in itself unique in tragedy; in Bacchae , however, the vicissitudes of secular power coincide with the main catastrophic turn: as Zeitlin says, 'the conflict between Dionysus and Pentheus, the religious, political, and familial issues, all unequi- vocally converge at the same point'.178 Secondly, the setting in Thebes and the involve- ment of the whole city as interlocutor of the god have prompted theoretical analysis of the ideas of city and 'anti-city'. Finally, Bacchae is the only tragedy with a Dionysiac subject proper of which we have an (almost) complete text: as such, it has been foregrounded by historical criticism as prospective evidence for the connections between tragic performance, the origins of the genre , and its effective status as experience of the polis. Examples of this scholarship are many and varied. For instance, Euben has analysed our play in terms of 'membership and dismembership',179 whereby Pentheus' physical sparagmos is an allegory for the de(con)struction of a society reduced to entropy, and dominated by loss of self and corruption of discourse, and 'Dionysus' punishment of Cadmus is the very undoing of civilization'.180 In terms of human characterization, parallel to this political crisis is the presumption that 'here is a man (or boy) without character - unformed, inconstant, tyrannical',181 inserted in a world where 'dismembership has replaced reciprocity'.182 Zeitlin has discussed the play in a similar perspective, stressing the depiction of Thebes as 'anti- Athens', and displacement as marker of the city's flawed foundations (based on autochthony - the sown men - and polluted by incest).183 Segal, again, has emphasized the dialectic between inside and outside, prison/palace and mountain, openness and closure, with Dionysiac action now seen as blurring the boundaries which separate these opposing poles.184 For us, these studies are most useful 'at a distance'. These approaches certainly offer precious clues, but they are of limited value for any enquiry into the view of self offered by a single play. Despite their differences, these readings all tend to bypass the limits of the single text (a finiteness which, in the case of tragedy, plays an active part in 178 Zeitlin (1986) 123. 179 Euben (1990). 180 Euben (1990) 131. 181 Euben (1990) 132: my italics. 182 Euben (1990) 130. 183 Zeitlin (1986) 102; see also Zeitlin (1993). 184 Segal (1997a) 78-124. See e.g. 97: 'As Dionysus invades and destroys the sheltered space of the house, so even more radically does he open the bounded limits of the city to the forces of the wild alien to it... Euripides evokes the otherness that the city must exclude. That exclusion involves a struggle between "man-and-/w/w- centred rationalism and god-and nature-centred emotionalism, between acculturation and instinct, nomos and physis [Quote from Wassermann (1953) 563].</page><page sequence="156">CHAPTER 3: THE RELATIONAL SELF' 147 determining the meaning of that text), but sometimes capriciously,185 often without due respect for the single play as unique microcosm, with a beginning and an end,186 and characteristically with reference to a wider frame of reference (such as those of structural anthropology) which is assumed, as if beyond criticism, and not argued for. It is also the case that, even within the same themes, same myths or same motifs - for instance, those associated with Dionysus at Thebes - given variables can completely change the representation of man. In particular, therefore, we should be exploring the very fact that in Bacchae communal participation is deprived of value as a point of reference in its own right, rather than assume that it is denied to the city of Thebes because of a fault in its roots, or among its inhabitants.187 Something analogous can be said about the widely-discussed opposition between royal family and city, oIko? and ttóXlç in Greek tragedy, an opposition which has been taken as paramount in our play. Not everyone is convinced that there is a permanent tension, in the tragic genre , between the two dimensions of family/royalty and politics/democracy - supposedly epitomized by the figure of Dionysus as 'destroyer of the household',188 who preserves the city by limiting the expansion of familial power and opposing endogamy. But even if we do accept the importance of the opposition in broad terms, its status in Bacchae' s Thebes is peculiar. First, Bacchae does not provide the constructive solution that one would expect at the end of the demolition process;189 secondly, it does not stage 185 Just one example: Euben (1990) 132 n. 3, on 'membership and dis-membership': 'in English "member" suggests the male sex organ, which is appropriate since the Bacchae raises questions about masculinity, about the way the male body politic maintains gender divisions, and about the relationship between Dionysus, tragedy, and the liberation of women'. It is just this type of connection that raises the issue of what is meant by 'appropriate' when interpreting a text in a foreign language. 186 A reading of 'the total corpus of myths...synchronically...as a "megatext" [displaying] the network of more or less subconscious patterns of "deep structures" or "undisplaced" forms' was advocated by Segal (1983) 176, who claimed that Greek myth and tragedy suit this approach in a particular way. See rightly Most (1983) 211-16 on the weaknesses and risks of applications of semiotics to classical studies. Another version of the 'megatextual' approach applied to the Bacchae is Kott's study of the play with wider reference to Dionysiac mythology and ritual, also drawing connections with Christian liturgy (Kott 1973). 187 Inter alia , there is a substantive objection to any reading of Bacchae which reconstructs a figure of Dionysus as a wild, centrifugal force opposed to the city: the attested role of the god as harmonizer of city and country, as described by Henrichs (1990). We face a similar contradiction between the god of Bacchae and actual cult as with Keuls' analysis of the positive role of Dionysus in marriage (Keuls 1984; see above, p. 144 with n. 171). Moreover, Di Benedetto (2004) 269, 478 recalls that Dionysus Perikionios had the prerogative to protect the house, so that the god's attack against the palace, and Cadmus' perhaps polemical mention of his dead nephew as the 'stay of the house' (1308-09) actually contradict familiar attributes of the god. The peaceful and civilized sides of Dionysus have often been overlooked by interpreters, who privilege 'the opposite notion, that Dionysus represents nature in a raw state, wilderness rather than civilization, violence, not peace' (Henrichs 1990, 271 ; see also Henrichs 1984a, 1993; Nottet 1981; Nussbaum 1990). 188 Seaford is the main advocate of this oppositional view of Greek tragedy: see Seaford ( 1981 ; 1993; 1996), with however Friedrich' s reply (1996). m As discussed above (p. 120, n. 72) this constructive solution could hardly have been provided by the mourning scene in the lacuna at the end of the play (see p. 99, n. 214). See Friedrich (1996) 274: 'the Bacchae can be said to realize Seaford's Dionysiac pattern only on the assumption that the lost ending showed the restoration of the polis through the establishment of the cult of Dionysus'. This assumption is one we cannot make; see also Friedrich (1990) 543: 'in Bacchae. . .the polis is shown as a spent force which has lost its hold on the citizens and therefore no longer functions as the ethical universe that civilizes and harmonizes them'. For a more balanced</page><page sequence="157">148 HIDDEN PATHS any representative of the ttóXiç in opposition to the oIkoç, as (say) Agamemnon does with the chorus of elders. In particular, the voices that defend Dionysus in the play are all too out of focus to be true representatives of the ttóXiç: Tiresias, who disappears after his first scene; Cadmus, who is finally exiled; the foreign Asians, who are blameworthy for rejoicing in 'the king's death' (1039-40); Agave; the messengers, with their external and partial knowledge. The discussion on the importance of the political component in the Bacchae , whether or not the ritual patterns reach a constructive outcome in the play and, more substantially, the adequacy of 'New Ritualism' as interpretative key for Greek drama and the Bacchae has produced a close debate in the past five years, with Seaford somehow engaged on two fronts. On the one hand he had to respond to Segal's accusations of schematism and reductionism of the literary event to a social or cultural function, accusations coming from a vision of literature more concerned with the specifics of language and representation, and to the suggestions of modern theory.190 On the other, he had to respond to the challenges posed to his 'pan-Dionysiac' interpretation of tragedy by Friederich. Friedrich, while welcoming Seaford's historicism as 'an antidote and an alternative to the pretentious post-structuralism that has gained currency in literary studies', found his fundamental dismissal of the literary dimension and of the textual level (which includes, among many things, a respect for the 'individuality of each author') no less an evil.191 Perhaps we may approach the issue from a different angle by noticing that in the Bacchae city and house coincide in the attitude of the protagonists; neither is preferred, nor presented in positive terms. Once again, the conventional status of Thebes as seat of disorder and the conventional opposition of ttoXis* to oIkoç (if indeed these conventions can be assumed) are exploited, as are the references to ritual or to seeing (to quote two central claims in Seaford's and Segal's interpretations, ritualism and metatheatre respectively), as part of the more urgent task of exploring the larger crisis between the individual and the world. 3.4.1 Linguistic isolation in the Bacchae: aloneness and unity One of the recurrent themes of the play is in fact the risk of isolation as opposed to the danger of openness, liberation and fusion. This theme is developed not only through the topic of Dionysiac cults and exotic maenadism: the deeper issue of mutual intelligibility between characters, as well as the relationship between man and world shaped in the play, reflects the same concern with a fracture between individual and environment. We have assessment of the significance of Pentheus' death in the play as echoing the mystic story of the dismembred child Dionysus see Easterling (1987) 16. 190 See Seaford (1998a, 1998b) and Segal (1998). Segal (1998): 'for Seaford Greek tragedy, grosso modo , replicates cultural patterns; for me, it is engaged in more "complex" negotiations with these patterns, using them, to be sure, but not always in a direct one-to-one correspondence, and not necessarily simply affirming them or restamping them onto its narrative material'. Segal (1999-2000), however, is more sympathetic towards Seaford's interpretative keys for tragedy and the Bacchae in particular, the 'destruction of the household' (274) and the reference to ritual. A fair assessment of the relationship between ritual and drama in tragedy is offered by Henrichs (2000) 175. 191 See Seaford (1996, 2000-2001, 2001-2002) and Friedrich (1996, 1999-2000, 133; 2001-2002).</page><page sequence="158">CHAPTER 3 : THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 49 seen that characters in Bacchae do not share a common idiomatic and expressive level,192 so that it is impossible for them to understand each other: misunderstanding, double- meaning and incommunicability mark human relations. Moreover, several more explicit passages offer reflections on isolation from and participation in the whole. The first instance is at 206-09, where Tiresias advocates his intention to join the dances on the mountain with Cadmus, despite their old age:193 206 où yap ôiiprix' ò 06 òç olire ròv véov eí XP1! xopeveiv oùt6 tòv yepaí,T€pov, àXX' aTTávTCüv ßouXeTai Tipa? exeiv Kotvás' ôiapiôpûv 8' ouôév' ai)£ea0ai QéXei. For the god has not distinguished between the young man having to dance, and the older man. But he wishes to have honours in common from all and to be magnified while distinguishing nobody. A marked emphasis is put on the nature of Dionysus as the god who brings unity and peace to all, abolishing distinctions based on sex, age, or social conditions (où yàp SiT)pr|x ' &gt; 206; 8iapi0púv 8 ' oùSév ' , 209). The verb 8iapi0péo) has here two meanings: 'make a difference, evaluate, distinguish' (e.g. between old and new) and 'reckon one-by- one' 'put in a class apart', which is foregrounded here by the opposition with èl I ámívTiov, 'in common from all' (208). A problem arises here: as a matter of fact, the two old men will not receive any reward for their acknowledgement of Dionysus' will and for their formal agreement with what the Asian Maenads experience in their communal celebrations - the necessity for worship aTrávTCüv. The target here, however, is not what might strike a modern reader as the 'superficiality' of the two old men's belief (although a degree of mockery of their formalism and calculation can certainly be acknowledged). Since Greek religion was far from Christian religion in not evaluating a communion with divinity in interiore homine as opposed to one achieved through external signs, the debate is rather on the possibility of unity itself; the impossibility of unity, per contra , is implicit in the emphasis that the same two characters put on their individual toils,194 and in Cadmus' ultimate defeat and loneliness, which he shares with Pentheus and Agave:195 the manifesto at 206-09 must remain, therefore, a pointer to an unattainable utopia.196 192 Chapter II. 1.2, pp. 74-81; II.3, pp. 103-06. 193 Levy (1975) notes here an opposition between the two attitudes: the one of the two old men, Cadmus and Tiresias (who is uttering this principle) propagandizing about religious worship - namely that one should not make a distinction between old and young; the other that of Pentheus, who insists in differentiating between old and new gods. mBa . 195-96. 195 Cadmus' reply to Agave after 1300 is also telling: 'what part in my madness had Pentheus?' 'equal to you (0|iXv éyévÉ0 'òpoioç), he did not respect the god' (1302). 196 Easterling (1987) 16 rightly underlines the final importance of 'the return of the head to the body as a gesture of reintegration, the only one that the play offers'. The only unity reached in the play is ultimately the |iiav ßXdßqv ('a single destruction') expressed at 1302-03.</page><page sequence="159">150 HIDDEN PATHS 'Isolation' is problematized through the usage of the word ¿pqpta and cognates. Pentheus shows a special concern for the dangerous isolation in which he imagines the women: at 222-23 he pictures each woman elç èpripiav I TTTioaaouaav, 'slinking off to the wild' with a man; at 688, again, a messenger challenges his view that the Bacchants are ipripiopévaç, 'abandoned' in the wild, 'hunting Cypris'; at 875 ¿pipía is instead positive, a safe 'wilderness without mortals' for the hunted fawn; at 1 176 the chorus asks Agave where she has been in these terms, ttóGév ¿pqpiaç;, 'from where in the wild?'. The relevance of isolation and participation is also apparent in the recurrent use of the word póvoç, 'alone'. At the beginning of the first scene (170-369) Cadmus' arrival is followed by a short sequence of stichomythia , centred on the two friends' old age and the fact that they are the only two to recognize the need to dance for the new god. The fact that they are alone (póvoi) among the Thebans in respecting the god is repeated twice in anaphora at the beginning of verses 195-96: Ka. póvoi Ô€ TTÓXeioç Bastai x°Peúaopev; Tc. póvoi yap cu (1&gt;povoûpcv' oi 8' dXXoi KaKÍoç. Ca. will we be the only members of the city to dance for Bacchus? Ti. yes, for we are the only ones with sense, the others have none. This 'aloneness' is a leitmotiv which both marks the selfishness of the two men's worship of Dionysus (based on the calculation of personal gain and frustrated by an opportunist misunderstanding), and is nevertheless a necessity they cannot escape, rather than a choice. It is also the negation of the doctrine expressed at 206-09: what was impiety there becomes, in the aged pair's misjudgement, a reason for being proud. The anaphoric repetition of the adjective póvoç significantly reappears at the end of the fourth scene, in the dialogue between Pentheus and the god (962-63): Tic. póvoç yàp aurav cip' àvqp ToXpûv tó8c. Ai. (lóvoç aù ttóXcoúç TfjaS' UTTCpKápveiÇ, pÓVOÇ* Penth. I am the only man of them to dare this deed. Dion. Alone you are toiling for this city, alone. These equivocal lines ominously prelude the king's fall, and link the two elderly men's calculating mistake to the 'sin' of Pentheus, whose motivations are far away from those of his grandfather, and who is marked by completely different flaws of character. Nonetheless, their two attitudes are similarly self-destructive. Self-destructive, likewise, is the emphasis that Agave places on her individual excellence in the hunt, on her distinction among the other women (1 183, (ict ' c(ic per ' epe;, '[the other women] after me, after me...' 1235, àuáoaç clnov, cÇóxtoç 8' epe, 'I mean all of them, but especially me'). Through this verbal insistence emphasis is posed on the isolation of characters at the moment of crisis or of a challenge posed by the events. Their choices and enterprises are always characteristically individual and performed in opposition to the world and to their fellow human beings, in contrast to Dionysus' appeals to unity and communion.</page><page sequence="160">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 151 3.4.2 Linguistic isolation in the Bacchae: on the usage of personal pronouns As is apparent from this last example ( Bacchae 1183, 1235), with or without an explicit marker like póvoç ('alone'), the usage of first- and second-person pronouns is liable to play an important role in putting emphasis on the isolation of individuals. Let us now consider their usage in Bacchae ,197 First of all, there are some statistical facts about pronoun usage in the three tragedians: first, Aeschylus uses first and second person personal pronouns strikingly less than the other two tragedians; secondly, Sophocles makes the highest use of the first-person singular pronoun, particularly as compared to Euripides with whom he shares an equal tally for other pronouns; thirdly (as a consequence), Euripides displays the largest usage of the first-person plural pronoun (fļp.eīs', 'we') as compared to the first-person singular pronoun (éycí), 'I' and at), 'you singular'), and especially in Bacchae. 198 This means, in particular, that 'we' discourses are more present in proportion to 'I' discourses than in the other two tragedians. Finally, as far as Bacchae is concerned, personal pronouns are generally less used than in the average Euripidean play, owing to a lower incidence of the second-, and in particular of the first-person singular pronoun. These facts are meaningful in the following senses: first, the objectification of mental processes we have analysed in Homer and Aeschylus199 is reflected in Aeschylus' lesser use of the subject pronouns cyoo and ai), to which the use of the composite-mind pattern is preferred. Secondly, Sophocles' notorious focus on the hero's individuality is reflected in his high usage of èyco, and overall higher incidence of personal pronouns; Sophocles' tally is comparable to Euripides', except for the younger tragedian's less extensive usage of éyco (already noted). Finally, Bacchae' s low occurrence of first-person (and, relatively, of second- person) singular pronouns among Euripides' plays is correlative to the decrease, in our play, of the usage (and, in particular, of the self-referential usage) of the composite-mind pattern:200 both data symptomatize a lesser ability on the part of characters to objectify themselves through discourse. Let us now consider more specifically the usage of personal pronouns in Bacchae with reference to the main characters, and include in the statistics possessive adjectives of the first and second person, which convey a similar emphasis on the subject and on the addressee respectively.201 The percentage of lines assigned to each of the main players is worth noting first: 197 See below, pp. 229-30, Table VI and VII for a full list of pronoun-usage scene by scene. 198 See below, p. 231, Table VIII. True, the average Aeschylean tragedy measures 1 160 verses, while the average Sophoclean and Euripidean play is longer (1477 and 1369 verses respectively). However, such difference in the average length of each of the three tragedians' plays is far less prominent than that in the usage of personal pronouns. For a more comprehensive treatment of personal pronouns as 'identity terms' in Greek tragedy see also Thumiger (2008, forthcoming). m Chapter 1.6, pp. 30-41. 200 Cf. above, II. 1 . 1 , pp. 67-70. 201 See below, p. 231, Table IX.</page><page sequence="161">152 HIDDEN PATHS Dionysus: 18% Pentheus: 13% Agave: 7% Cadmus: 10% Chorus: 27% The usage of first-person singular pronouns or adjectives is distributed thus: Dionysus (34%), Pentheus (22%), Agave (15%), Cadmus (13%) and the chorus (9%). As noted above, their overall occurrence is lower than in any other Euripidean or Sophoclean play; it is particularly noticeable that Pentheus, probably against our expectation, makes a relatively limited usage of them. We can frame this fact within Pentheus' general avoidance of self-reflective judgements and his unawareness of himself. First-person plural pronouns or adjectives are used mostly by Cadmus (6 times, 21%: 183, 331, 336, 342, 1249, 1377). Agave uses them 4 times (14%: 1209, 1243, 1294, 1296), and the chorus twice (7%: 583, 608); Dionysus uses the plural meaning 'we' only once (at 924, 4%); another 7 times he uses it as a plurale maiestatis/modestiae (518, 617, 618, 659, 825, 932, 1345). Pentheus also uses the plural only once genuinely (at 217, 4%), and once as a plurale maiestatis (920). Second-person plural pronouns, 'you plural', are never used in the play to address Pentheus or Dionysus: they are used to identify Agave and the Theban women (twice, 33%), Cadmus and Tiresias (once, 17%) and the chorus of the Asian Maenads (once, 17%). We can infer from this that Pentheus and Dionysus tend to oppose each other individually, and not to conceive of a 'we' and not to be perceived as part of group (a 'you plural') by others. This is even more significant, given that in Bacchae first- and second- person plural pronouns are no less frequent than in any other play; moreover, Dionysus' position as leader of a group and Pentheus' professed commitment to the city would make us expect a notable presence of inclusive 'we' discourse in their utterances.202 The usage of ov ('you' singular) and second-person singular possessives matches the 'passivity' we have associated with Pentheus' seeing:203 the king is the character most singled out by others through direct address, with the pronoun 'you' or the adjective 'your' (41% of the total are addressed to him), while his own usage of the 'you-group' in address to others is much lower (17%). Dionysus, on the other hand, is the character who utters the highest number of second-person pronouns and adjectives (27%, mainly addressing Pentheus), whereas far fewer are addressed to him (18%). The crucial point is that, rather than focusing on others as individuals, Pentheus is himself addressed and isolated by others as 'you', via accusations and insistent appeals. In some passages we find a highly relevant emphasis on pronouns or possessive adjectives which underlines a contrast between two individuals - especially, but not only, in passages of stichomythia .204 202 Compare, for example, Oedipus in OT addressing Tiresias on behalf of the whole community at 300-15, 'Phoebus has been consulted by us ' (fpîv, 306); likewise Jocasta at 921, addressing Apollo 'so that you may concede us (Tplv) a pure liberation'; Pelasgos at Aeschylus' Supplices 411, 'so that these matters might end up well for us ' (fplv). 203 Chapter III. 1.1, pp. 112-13. 204 Stichomythia is much used in our play to underline the opposition between the god and the king (cf. Gould 1987b, 36, who notes 'the play's extended use of stichomythia to construct whole scenes'). In our play we find</page><page sequence="162">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 53 Let us cite some notable examples.

But as for the Bacchants whom you imprisoned, whom you took off . . . The three pronouns that concern us are T, uttered by the servant at 441 ; 'you', uttered by the servant in the reported direct speech at 442; 'you', used by the servant addressing Pentheus at 443. All these are placed at or near the beginning of the line; in particular, ae and au are mutually allusive: the servant is mediating between Pentheus and the stranger. The opposition of subjective views and responsibilities is also underlined by the assonance between Kàyco, oùx ckcov and dyco at the beginning and at the end of 441 and the beginning of 442. Next, 504-05: 504 A. au8c5 pe 'ir' Seiv, ao)c()povajv où aco&lt;ļ)poaiu. TI. èva) 8è 8etv ye, Kuptarrepoç aéQeu. Dion. T, who have sense, tell you, who have no sense, not to bind me* Penth. 'And I, who have more authority than you, say to bind you' Though the | le of 504 is not in itself emphatic, èyco and aéGev, at the beginning and end of 505, are - and the parallelism between the lines is sufficient to create a sense of a threefold pronominal cluster. Once again, Pentheus and Dionysus are opposed as two individuals asserting themselves, one against the other. Similarly, with the emphatic ëycoye, picking up the (in themselves) less emphatic second-person pronouns in the line before, at 655-56: 655 TT. GO&lt;f&gt;òç aoc^òs" cru, ttXt)v a 8eî a'eîvai aocķov.

If we add the four climactic lines of dvnXaßfi at 966-70, we get a total of 127 lines in all. 21 1 lines altogether are exchanged by the god and the king; we may note both the attention paid to the two characters' relationship and the close, mutually reactive tone of their verbal communication shown by the high percentage of stichomythic parts within it.</page><page sequence="163">154 HIDDEN PATHS Dion. ...not as I fitted it under the sash. Penth. Inside, in shaking it forward and shaking it backward, and acting as a Bacchant, I dislodged it from its place ... Repetition of the first-person pronoun between, first, Dionysus and then Pentheus enacts the opposition, as does the assonance of the two verbal forms Ka0f|ppoaa (929, T fitted') and p.60a)pfii(ja (931, T dislodged'), both first-person aorist, and in parallel metrical position. The actions of the two opponents are of course precisely parallel: Dionysus fitted Pentheus' hair-dress, and the king dislodged it. Finally, at 1118-21, Pentheus' last, affecting words are structured by a cluster of pronominal forms in which the opposition is all in Pentheus' own mind: ... ¿veo toi, pfļT6p, elļil, ttcuç qéQev TTeV06ÚÇ, ÒV 6T6K6Ç kv ÔÓpOLÇ ' ExiOVOS" 1120otKTipe 8' go (ifļT6p '±e_, pr)8è raíç èuai? ápapTiaiai TraiSa oòv KaTaKTái/qg. . . . 'Look, it is I, mother, your child, Pentheus, whom you bore in the house of Echion. Pity me, o mother, and do not through my errors kill your child'. At 1118 èyœ and aeOev are in prominent and symmetrical position, recalled by èpaîç at 1120; then, in an overlapping pattern at 1120 and 1121, the accusatives of the pronoun and the 'opposite' adjective (pfjTép (ic/TraiSa aóv) respond to one another, underlining the mother-son relationship.205 The distribution of pronominal forms is also relevant to our enquiry.206 The use of pronouns by different characters varies in the play, depending on whether the characters are foregrounded as subjects or objects of address. We see this in the two scenes where the god and the king are directly opposed (and share a roughly equal number of lines), at 434-518 and 775-846/912-76. The former scene contains the first encounter between the two; the latter is the confrontation after the palace-miracle, with the king's derangement and dressing-up. In the first, Dionysus uses first-person singular pronouns or adjectives 9 times (plus a single plurale maiestatis) against Pentheus' 5 occurrences. In the second, the proportions are reversed: 19 (plus a single plurale maiestatis ) for Pentheus against 10 (plus 2 pluralia maiestatis ) for Dionysus. In the second scene, the king appropriates and interiorizes the aims of his enemy so as finally to assert them in a wholly individualist way, whereas in the first scene he is still acting - at least seemingly - on behalf of external principle and law, attempting to objectify himself into them. The markers of Pentheus' madness, as we have seen, are individualism and self-closure: these correspond to his greater usage of first-person singular pronouns or adjectives in the derangement scene. Conversely, Dionysus asserts his position individualistically in the first scene, when his strategy against Pentheus is frontal; in the second scene, conversely, the god steps back and leaves the spotlight on the king's deranged viewpoint. 205 The antithesis between Taiç épais* ápapTÍaiai (1120-21) andiTcaSa aóv (1 121) is noted by Dodds (1960) 217. 206 See below, pp. 229-31, Tables VI and VII and Table IX.</page><page sequence="164">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF 1 55 We find the same pattern in the usage of second-person singular pronouns and adjectives: in the earlier scene, Pentheus addresses or alludes to Dionysus with a second- person pronoun or adjective 7 times, while Dionysus does the same to him 4 times; in the second, we see the reverse, with Pentheus addressing Dionysus thus 8 times and Dionysus addressing Pentheus 27 times. The heavier usage of first and second-person singular pronouns, respectively by and with reference to Pentheus, is a hitherto unnoticed means of conveying the interiorizing of the king in his defeat and derangement. 3.4.3 Isolation and openness: politics and beyond In his study of our play,207 Leinieks claims that the idea that 'the traditional political leadership has failed' is central to Euripides' late work,208 and that a certain ideal of community is central to Dionysus' action in Bacchae. This idea of community is pivoted on the concept of liberation through universality, unity, and joy. The new contribution of Euripides is, on Leinieks' reading, an evaluation of the concept of 'joy' as the force which brings together and holds together human society rather than family affection (&lt;f&gt;i''ia). 'Euripides found the standard theory (based on &lt;f&gt;iXia) unacceptable. Devaluation of the theory is the chief point in the Orestes... [ Fjamily goes together with criminal behaviour. In the Bacchae Euripides put joy in the place of family affection'.209 If we add this essentially political element to the wider Euripidean construction of human psychology and human relationships, various themes (from the life of the polis to sexual identity) appear deeply interconnected within a world where nothing at all can be taken for granted. Here I have to disagree with Leinieks' conclusions. Even though a kind of unity beyond the institutional-political one or the family is longed for in the play, Euripides gives us no grounds for optimism regarding the possibility of its realization.210 However, we should resist any one-sided reading of the play; in Bacchae , family and politics are equally ineffectual for man's self-definition.211 What Leinieks praises as the Euripidean proposal of 'universality'212 is more of a universal black hole, which sucks in not only the socio-political structure but the whole relationship between man and world. Let us therefore insist that, while it is useful to frame our reading historically,213 the issues 207 Leinieks (1996). 208 In Leinieks (1996) 11 this failure is mainly ascribed to the 'desire for prominence' of political leaders (4&gt;i'oTip.ia). In our play, such &lt;f&gt;iXoTipla is indeed central, but it actually brings together Pentheus, Dionysus and Agave. 209 Leinieks (1996) 335-36. 210 Leinieks (1996) 348-49: 'Euripides made his answer universal and timeless by its very nature... What was right were the Athenian political ideas of freedom and unity. What needed to be done was to extend these concepts to those to whom they had not been applied before'. Contrast Podlecki (1974, 164-65): 'perhaps the worst alienation of all... is from the social group, with its alluring programme of fellowship and good-cheer. .. [at the end of the play] there is now just revulsion, self disgust'. 211 Inter alia, the representative of political institution, Pentheus, is marked as dGeov dvopov dÔiKov, 'ungodly, unlawful, unjust' at 995 and 1015. 2,2 Leinieks (1996) 345. 213 See e.g. Friedrich (1996) 277 on the nature of Athenian democracy, and on the conditions which led to its decay: '[the polis*] freedom did not include subjective or individual freedom... [I]t was predicated on the individual citizens' total subordination of their aspirations, desires, ambitions and needs to the common good and</page><page sequence="165">156 HIDDEN PATHS of individualism and isolation be considered in a more comprehensive framework than a strictly political reading allows. In Bacchae , in point of fact, not only are the ideals of individualism and unity not presented as attainable alternatives: they are not advocated by clear-cut opposed parties. The two poles of the contrast (Dionysus and Pentheus) both have their own egoistic needs: worship, acknowledgement and control of the situation, for Dionysus; tyrannical desire to be accepted and be honoured as ruler, for Pentheus. Indeed, even Agave, at 1 193, expects the chorus to praise her ( eiraiveiç ;, 'do you praise?').214 At the same time, all these characters have their own ideal of unity - whether based on maenadism or restrictive conformity.215 One could reasonably say that in other tragedies, as well as in the Homeric poems, we have a representation of a single hero isolated from a context: witness the Sophoclean Ajax or Antigone, and (behind them) Achilles in the Iliad. The crucial difference, how- ever, is that in the two tragic examples mentioned there is a 'strong context' within which the characters are misfits and isolated. All other characters understand each other and themselves, but he or she chooses to set himself or herself apart from the logic of that context. Both Ajax and Antigone are extroverted and somehow lacking in nuance; they epitomize the identification of ethos with praxis , character with action, where no gap is left between the supposed personality behind the mask and the behavioural utterance. This is apparent even, or especially, in the momentary deviation from character offered by the 'deception speech' in Ajax (646-92).216 By way of delineating this 'strong context' in Antigone , we need only cite the Kfipirypa ('proclamation') which is Antigone's target from line 8. The whole contrast between Ismene and Antigone is centred on their relationships with toíç èv réXei ßeßokTi ('those who rule', at 67) and Ta tûv 0€ûv evTiļi '('the things honoured by the gods', at 77). Their responses to the two constraints shape the plot and the ethics of the play. Without these two elements we cannot imagine the two characters: the Sophoclean Antigone without her reference to a superior principle, or Ismene without her deference to human law simply cease to exist. We find the opposite in Bacchae . The 'ethical barycentre' of Pentheus is not determined by contextual elements - by his role as king, as son, as male, as citizen, as Greek, as devotee of traditional divinities. All these are deprived of stable relevance, and on their unquestioning compliance with ancestral custom: the ethical life of the polis had no room for auto- nomous individuality... That's why the polis could not last.' 2 l4C/. what Tiresias says at 319-20, opa?; cri) xcdpeis*, ÖTav èfaoTÚoiv iruXdis* I ttoXXoí, tò ĪTevOčus' 6' òvopa peyaXúuq ttóXiç ('do you see?

In fact, to overcome the aporia caused by the attribution of unity to both the god and his opponent, Leinieks in the end has to set the character Dionysus loose from his own 'message': 'at the end of the play Dionysus and the principle of liberation have triumphed. Euripides, however, takes the principle of liberation yet one step further. He separates it from Dionysus ... and lets it stand on its own merit... as a result [Dionysus] is effectively separated from the serious questions of the play' (324-25). 2,6 Already discussed in Chapter 1.6, pp. 38-39.</page><page sequence="166">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 1 57 the presentation of characters gives way to internalized and unrepeatable features of the self. It is true that the representation of Thebes in Athenian theatre is essentially negative: an excessive presence of family (incest and monstrous offspring, fratricide wars), pollution and political instability, whereby endogamy is the negative consequence of its own autochthonous origins (Cadmus' foundational act of man-sowing).217 However, Pentheus' characterization is not simply correlative to this 'negativity'. For our purposes, the psychological portrayal of Pentheus - its incoherence, fragmentation, unawareness, and lack of objectified self-presentation - offers an original and new depiction of hum- anity beyond the Theban context, although benefiting from and exploiting it. If the depic- tion of a human being like Pentheus is conveniently set in Thebes, it does not follow that Thebes' flawed presentation as a city in itself entails any such psychological case as the Euripidean Pentheus. His isolation and detachment must be taken as free-standing and not as a mere function of the mythological, ritual, or political structure reflected by the play. 3.4.4 Beyond the Greek and the barbarian We have so far considered politics in the internal sense, as organization of the city. The politics of confrontation with the outside world are also useful to assess the representation of character as far as ethnical and cultural self-definition are concerned: the category of the barbarian, the experience of exile and autochthony, travel and geographic displace- ment as constructive of identity. These elements of identity are also brought into discussion in the Bacchae. In the play the opposition between civilized Greek and oriental world, which had become a firm point in Greek self-definition after the Persian wars, is devalued. As Hall explores in her extensive study on the construction of the Athenian idea of 'barbarian', a rhetorical polarization between Greek and Eastern was developed by Athenian ideology in the course of the fifth century. Such rhetoric proceeds somehow in a circular motion to the construction of an ideal barbarian and than back to the attribution of the same flaws to 2,7 Zeitlin, in her reading of the Theban saga (Zeitlin 1986, 1993), has delineated a city which is a closed system, where walls, endogamy, autochthony and incest are functions of the same retreating into oneself (albeit, one may note, autochthony can be positive and 'Athenian': see Loraux 1986, 149, 193). On Zeitlin's reading, the deficiency in Theban familial relations determines both distance from home (Oedipus) and excessive closeness to home (Oedipus again); both inclusion (Dionysus' kinship to the Theban royal family) and exile or exclusion (Oedipus, and Dionysus); both xenophobia (Pentheus) and excessive intimacy. Analogous observations have been made by Goff, with particular reference to the status of women in the city (Goff 1995): whereas in Athens women are active in celebrating rituals - that is precisely their contribution to the polis ' well-being - in Thebes they are never allowed to do so. This misplacement of women leads to 'the Theban city's failure to constitute itself as a viable ttóXiç' (362). In Bacchae , notably, we have the only instance where the Theban women are allowed to perform rite, but in fact their rite is, far from beneficial to the city, a failed and threatening one. Vidal- Naquet (1988b) has added another chapter to the story in an article on Oedipus 'between two cities' in the Sophoclean plays, where Thebes is the negative of Athens in its tyrannical government or even lack of leadership, and in its mendacious and violent nature. From another viewpoint, Chirassi-Colombo analyses Thebes' failure in terms of religious impiety and hybris against the gods: Thebes is 'the reflected image of what Athens would become in history if it were not able to perform Bacchic rites' (Chirassi-Colombo 1991, 347, my translation). In Athens, Dionysus is controlled and tamed under institutional guidance, and becomes the enhancer of 'good disorder'.</page><page sequence="167">158 HIDDEN PATHS Greek wrongdoers.218 This Athenian discourse is pivoted upon a number of fixed stereotypes which involve both foreign/Eastern and Greek ethnicity. Hall organizes them along the lines of language, behaviour, costumes and politics. Her analysis shows how foreign language is characterized by writers through incongruity and cacophony, and such effects as alliteration, repetition and cries. Foreign behaviour is stereotyped in the sense of ignorance and gross machismo; cowardice coupled with boast; feminineness and luxury (paXcucia, 'effeminacy'; Tpucķf), 'delicacy'; aßp0TT)9, 'luxuriousness', et similia ); feminine traits; abandonment and dance; excess in lament and grief. From the point of view of ethnography, the barbarians are characterized by greed, love of alcohol, and a privileged relationship with the gods; from the point of view of religious practice, they display a devotion to a cult of the elements, the practice of human sacrifice, cannibalism, infanticide, ecstasy and prophecy; politically, we find in them a tendency towards tyranny, hierarchicalism, servilism, personal cult of the royal, excessive concession of power to women, recourse to mutilation and castration as means of control.219 In tragedy these elements are re-elaborated to portray Greek flawed characters. The Aeschylean Clytemnestra, for instance, has the traits of cruelty, mercilessness, excess from her feminine duties which are the province of a barbarian woman, as with Medea. Also, Oedipus in Sophocles' OT shows the attribution of barbarian vices to a Greek: he is irascible, despotic, and has a privileged relationship with the gods - he is the elected one, for good and for bad. Barbarian traits are indeed used in many tragedies to convey the idea of excess, hybris , and transgression. In Bacchae foreign elements are overabundant, primarily because of the Asian flavour of the subject itself. The barbarian element, however, not only characterizes the foreign chorus and Dionysus himself, but also the Theban women, Agave, Pentheus and finally Cadmus. The chorus' lyrics are full of exotic words and names (an exotic feel is also conveyed through sound-effect and metres);220 moreover, the women offer a depiction of cowardice, excessive mourning and frenzied behaviour which fall under the stereotypes mentioned. Agave and the Theban women offer a portrayal of hybristic barbarian religiosity: infanticide, sanguinary rites and cannibalism. Dionysus is feminine, flattering, anti-heroic in his astute way of fighting the opponent, and sensual in his praise of the joys of life. Pentheus is machist and boastful, cowardly, excessive, tyrannical, oppressive, finally feminine and helplessly timid, and will end up mutilated in the way he wanted to mutilate the stranger.221 The category of the barbarian is made object of re-elaboration in the light of a new humanism in many Euripidean plays (see e.g. Hecuba , Troades ), where a new look is cast upon the foreigners, a look of comprehension and acknowledgement of the common 2,8 Hall (1989) 210. 2,9 Hall (1989) The barbarians enter myth' (101-59). 220 See Hall (1989) 130-31 : 'emotional lyricism becomes the vehicle for barbarian - especially female barbarian - self-expression; the spoken trimeter is the medium of Hellenic reason'. 221 Contrast Ba. 241, where Pentheus says he will punish the stranger, (rpaxr|^ol/ awpaTos1 xwPLS" Tepaw, 'cutting his neck from his body'), with Agave's final return to Thebes with his son's head stuck onto her thyrsus (1139-42; 1200ff.).</page><page sequence="168">CHAPTER 3: THE * RELATION AL SELF' 1 59 miseries of human life;222 however, the element works differently in Bacchae , where Hall's list of 'barbarian stereotypes' fits strikingly well in the description of many of the main characters. In the play barbarian flaws are attributed to the very heart of a Greek society - even if Thebes; parodies of barbarian vices characterize the main characters, Theban as well as foreign. Somehow, we see in Bacchae a return to what Hall notes about ethnicity in the Iliad, where the heroic codes of excellence overcome ethnic boundaries and all Homeric heroes are represented as obeying a generally consistent system of values.223 In the Bacchae something symmetrical happens: characters share a common 'barbarian-ness', a general distance from the received idea of civilization which similarly overcomes ethnic boundaries. An exemplary display of this distance is the passage at 1330-39. In these lines Dionysus condemns Cadmus and his wife Harmonia to a special kind of exile, which includes metamorphosis and to wage a war against Greece in the future: 1330 ôpdKOJV y£VT|OT) peTaßaXcüv, Sápap re of) 6K0Tļpica06ia ' òfyeoç àXXáÇei túttov, t)v "Apeos boxes' fAppovíav 0vt|TÒs yeyúç. òxov 8è pócrxoüv, XPTlalIòç cbç Xéyei Aióç, èXâç 'i€T 1 àXóx ou ßapßdpcov fiyotjpevoç, 1335 TToXXàç 8è TTépaeiç àvapl01ia) OTpaTÉiJfiaTi TTÓX6LS" OTdV 8è AoÇlOU XPfl^TflPtOV 8iapTráaajai, vóotov a0Xiov TráXiv (jKf|(Tou(jr aè 8 '"Apri?

The transformation into snakes might be connected with early Theban beliefs, and the snake-shape might have been proper to Harmonia from the beginning, in connection with her role as 'house goddess and divine consort of the early king who built the Mycenean palace on the Cadmeia'.224 However, the archetypal function of theriomorphism is here 222 Cf. Said (2002) on the vanishing boundary between Greek and barbarian in Euripides. Di Benedetto (2004) 401 notes that Pentheus' emphasis on the opposition between Greek and non-Greek (see Ba. 481-84, 779) is a 'rearguard battle' (400, my translation). 223 See Hall (1989) 19-47. 224 Dodds (1960) 235.</page><page sequence="169">160 HIDDEN PATHS subject to a reversal; it becomes an instrument of exile and estrangement, rather than to express a familial and political rootedness. The glorious sowing of the 'race of Thebans', Grißaiojv yévoç (1314) - the foundation of the polis - is thwarted by the revenge of Dionysus, and Cadmus' particular punishment touches him in his main point of pride, the honour of his family and race, his yévoç, and his political prestige. Along the lines of estrangement and political excommunication, the prediction-condemnation that Cadmus will become the chief of a barbarian horde is also significant: the old king is doomed to move against Hellas itself, to sack Delphi and to be finally overtaken by disaster as a consequence of the sacrilege.225 The political 'sin' of familial closure and the religious and moral misunderstanding of the divinity will be expiated after the destruction of Delphi, the seat of Apollo's oracle, and nowhere else. Apollo is the god whose prophetic skills Dionysus is displaying in this last scene, who was also alluded to by Tiresias in his praise of the god in the first scene (298; 306), and explicitly mentioned by the chorus on the same occasion (328-29). He is, ultimately, the god who symbolizes perhaps more fully the identity of Greek civilization and ethics. In these lines a twisting of civilization's equilibrium is envisaged. In this connection, we can say that the opposition Greek-Barbarian, East-West, wild- civilized, bridged by the motive of Dionysiac journey, is at a deeper level overcome in Bacchae. In the chorus' lyrics, in the prologue recited by Dionysus, in Tiresias' speech two different 'Dionysiac geographies', both physical and cultural geographies, are set out and mixed, as it is finally epitomized by the journey to which Cadmus is condemned. Many places are in fact recalled in the play:226 Dionysus mentions Lydia (13), Phrygia and Persia (14), Baktria (15), the land of the Medes and Arabia (16), the whole of Asia (17). Asia (64), Phrygia and Lydia (140) are again mentioned by the chorus, so too Phrygia (Tmolos at 65 and 154; 86, 127, 140), Syria (144), and Crete (121) in the parodos. In the first stasimon (370-431), Cyprus (402), Paphos (406), Pieria (410) and Olympus (411) are longed for; in the second stasimon (519-75) the map includes rivers or waters: Acheloos (519), the spring Dirke (520); then Nysa (556), the Corycian cave on Parnassos (559), Pieria (565), the Axios (569) and Ludias rivers (571) in Macedonia. The effect of these geographical references is to relativize and broaden the horizon of the play's setting, involving religious and cultural aspects as well: a number of divinities are in fact associated to this mapping. In the chorus' beatitude of the god's followers, and in their longing for ecstatic pleasures we find the Asiatic Cybele (79), Zeus (95), the Curetes (120-21), the Mother Rhea (128), the Satyrs (130); and, in the first stasimon , Aphrodite and the Erotes (403-05), the Charités and Pothos (415), Eirene (419-20). Some of these connections go back to myth (Zeus); the Curetes or Korybants are aetiologically connected with the discovery of the Dionysiac musical instruments, the flute and the 225 Di Benedetto (2004) 481 sees in these lines an ideological shift in the notion of 'barbarian' from the initial usage of the word made by the god. Barbarian and Hellenic were initially treated as equal (18), while 'barbarian' is now equated to uncivilized and wild, and generally presented as unpleasant (see 1354) 226 Easterling (1994) has suggested a reading of Euripidean landmarks outside Athens in the sense of an attention, on the part of the tragedian, to 'places where a production might be staged' (79) and to potential new audiences, rightly underlining a general need to consider tragedy as not 'obsessively Athenocentric' (74). In Bacchae' s case, however, the mention of foreign places is also intermingled with the journey-motif and the insistence on the 'escape from the city' theme that shape the events in the play.</page><page sequence="170">CHAPTER 3: THE 'RELATIONAL SELF' 161 kettle-drum; the reference to Aphrodite and the Erotes is a more abstract one, and regards the pleasures that Dionysus' gift to man grants. Tiresias' speech tries to connect the new god with traditional Olympian names: Demeter (275), Hera (290), Zeus (291), Ares (302), the prophetic skill that the chorus will rightly connect to Apollo (328; see 298). The journey is indeed one of the attributes of Dionysus, and his itinerary from the East to Greece can be read as 'leading towards the organization of a cultural space',227 as the journey of an oiKionfc, a 'colonizer', and a civilizer,228 whereby Dionysus' movement combines, as Scarpi says, the East- West movement that heroes perform in mythology with the wider freedom of 'vertical' movement proper to gods. However, a devaluation of ethnic and geographical definitions is in Bacchae specifically superimposed to the motif of the god's journey. The geographical and cultural opposition, or even reunion, of East and West is emptied of a firm ethical connotation in the play. Dionysus' itinerary, finally reversed by Cadmus' own, crosses the divisions on which Greek ethnographic self- definition was constructed. The motif of £evia ('hospitality', as well as 'the state of a foreigner'), central to all Dionysiac myths of rejection and reception (and which is natural to the god), is problematized. Belonging and externality, reception and refusal are not straightforwardly alternative choices any longer: Dionysus Çévioç was in fact a kin, while the regnant Pentheus appears onstage presenting himself as €kôt||ioç ('absent from this land', 215).229 In sum, we have seen in this chapter the other side of an important change in the representation of man and world at the turn of the fifth century. The presentation of self which emerged in Chapter II was internalized, marked by unawareness and inability to communicate, allusive of an unfathomable and unrepeatable depth. In this respect the representation of self is distinct from the one which emerges in Homer or in earlier tragedy, where disturbing feelings or metal states are broadly externalized, and the exist- ence of a firm world-order is not questioned. The internalized, self-absorbed represent- ation of self of the Bacchae must be interconnected with a crisis in the earlier represent- ation of the external world as firmly granted, whereby the validity of categories usually employed to qualify individuals vacillates. This crisis affects various levels of reality, as we have explored in this chapter: what we call 'nature' (the biological distinction between man and animal, and to some extent family relations and gender definitions) as well as cultural constructions (political and ethnical belonging, the concepts of male and female, the dynamic of family bonds).230 These categories are problematized, and no longer offer a safe reference for human self definition and dramatic characterization. 227 Scarpi (1991) 403. 228 See Scarpi (1991) 405. See also McGinty (1978) for Dionysus' revenge myth as enhancing a 'validation of the Hellenic worldview'. 229 See above, p. 141 n. 153. 230 On the 'political crisis' highlighted by the play see Marietti (2003) 59, who reads Agave's exile at the end of the play, her withdrawal from participation in the community and her desire to go where 'neither polluted Cithaeron can see me, nor may I see Cithaeron with my eyes' as 'in some sense un-Greek, because to deny the TToXiTiKÓv, the political experience proper to man is to deny what made the experience of theatre and Athenian democracy possible in the first place' (my translation).</page><page sequence="171">CHAPTER IV - TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER: NARRATIVE FACTS, STYLISTIC FACTS AND THE VIEW OF MAN In Chapters II and III we focused on personal instantiations of the Greek world view as applied to a reading of Bacchae , looking at them from the inside (the representation of self, in Chapter II) and from the outside (the representation of the world, in Chapter III). Let us turn to supra-personal aspects of characterization, only touched upon in the last two chapters which focused more closely on motifs and referential aspects of the text. Here, we should bear in mind that this distinction between personal and supra-personal is more of a working-model than a critical statement: both elements, in fact, contribute to the representation of man in a text, and they are only separable in analysis, not in the effect. By supra-personal, I mean aspects which are not directly expressive of personal identity, but that nevertheless contribute to the view of man or the world held in the text, and therefore affect characterization. Under this heading, I shall consider narratological and stylistic aspects of the play. It may be useful to recall briefly our two main conclusions so far, as they are the premises for the following analysis: (i) representation of character and view of man are deeply interrelated. (ii) view of man and view of the world are contiguous: to a weaker view of the world-system corresponds a less externalized representation of man. Our scrutiny of the above-mentioned * supra-personal aspects' is grounded on a third premise, that the view of self is to fictional character as the view of the world is to those aspects. This means that a worldview where points of reference are systematically questioned corresponds, from a literary point of view, to such elements as narratival openness and personalized imagery and idioms. Therefore, far from being merely formal matters, these features have a direct bearing on the general ideology promoted or criticized in the play, and on the representation of character in it. I have divided the features that are to be analysed into two main groups. In the first, I include narratological aspects (relation of character to plot, structure, illusion,1 fictional time, authorial control); and in the second, imagery, speech-figures and other aspects of style. The two groups may seem to comprise awkwardly heterogeneous features; yet these features all bear on the presentation of world and man. The aim is to show, through a comparison with the other tragedians' work and a consideration of general Euripidean tendencies, that in Bacchae these features also contribute to a representation of self that is introverted and marked by lack of awareness, to a representation of characters as more idiosyncratic, detached from their actions and doomed to reciprocal incommunicability, and to a world which is no longer understandable. These representations are achieved in 1 In this chapter, by illusion' I mean very specifically the quality of a fictional text that makes the audience or reader oblivious to the fictional means. For instance, a third-person novel creates more illusion than a collection of letters, or an autobiography. 163</page><page sequence="172">164 HIDDEN PATHS the following ways: as far as stylistic features are concerned, through the evolution from imagery to symbol, the enactment of imagery, and a 'loss of faith' in words; as far as narratological aspects are concerned, through the realization of a stronger fictional illusion. 4. 1 Character and plot within the play The relationship between character and plot in Bacchae stands out within the corpus of surviving tragedies. When we analysed the critical notion of tragic character, in Chapter I, we recalled Hegel's judgements on tragic character as bound to action, as almost exhaustively contained in a character's behavioural utterances, incapable of conveying the impasse which often characterizes modern literary representations of man. We also said that characters in, say, Aeschylus, offer a flatness and meagreness of detail which make them less liable to prompt naturalistic identification.2 These facts, scarcity of idiosyncratic traits for characters and concomitance between character and dramatic action, are interrelated: Aeschylean characters invite judgement for what they do or say , rather than conjectural interpretations of their unexpressed motivations or feelings ' extra litteram' This is not the case for Bacchae. The representation of character in the play exceeds and departs from usual typologies ('character beyond type'), from mythological patterns ('character beyond myth') and from the limits set by their external behaviour ('character beyond action'). 4.1.1 Character beyond type To shed some light on the difference between Bacchae' s and earlier tragic character- ization we may recall, with some caution, the notion of type. An obsolete strand of traditional accounts of tragic character identifies the characters with types or masks - the tyrant, the unmarried girl, and so on.3 Superficial and limiting though this terminology is, it still helps to illuminate an aspect of Aeschylean characterization, characterized by lack of idiosyncrasies and everyday detail which differs from the practice in Bacchae. In fact, our play is the furthest example from the schematic generalities proposed by Murray: 'Dionysus, Pentheus, Cadmus, Tiresias...are characters that hardly need proper names. One might as well call them - the God, the Young King, the Old King, the Prophet'.4 In our play the deviation of a character's behaviour from his or her expected role is very important, and is obtained by exploiting traditional detail. In this way Tiresias, for instance, is victim of the traditional accusations against soothsayers (in the similarly traditional contrast between soothsayer and royal power) while, at the same time, in many 2 See Chapter I, pp. 6; 30-33. 3 See Chapter I, pp. 20-21 with n. 76. 4 Murray 1965, 92. Cf. also Arrowsmith (1967) 68, who comments, in the same spirit, that 'Euripides [in Bacchae ] had no interest... in heroism; it was an extreme and schematic modal situation that interested him, not character' [my emphasis], Rosenmeyer (1968) 164; 165: 'in the Bacchae [character] counts for very little'. See instead Blaiklock (1952) 21 1: 'the play is simply and obviously a drama of character'; and Kitto (1961) 377, who claims for Bacchae's Pentheus a 'much more normal treatment of character' than in the other Euripidean later plays, that make him 'more convincing...; in Medea, Jason and Hippolytus there is an exaggeration completely absent from Pentheus'.</page><page sequence="173">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 65 ways he shows himself to be a manipulative sophist and a 'modern' intellectual.5 Cadmus forces his mythological role of founder of the genos to its extreme: his patriarchy leads him to play a father's role to Pentheus, and, in a parody of his foundational act, to defend the honour of the family by making himself ridiculous, dressed as a Maenad. It is, of course, constitutional to other tragic characters to deviate from 'typical' behaviour: Clytemnestra's boldness, Antigone's inflexibility, Iphigenia's courage are three examples from the three tragedians. However, in these last cases it is one unfitting act or choice which determines the character's 'eccentric' behaviour (to kill a husband, to choose death on behalf of a principle, to prefer death to cowardice respectively), while for our characters, and especially for Pentheus, it is a mixture of elements that is determinative. 4. 1.2 Character beyond myth In Bacchae the interaction between dramatic representation and mythical tradition becomes an important means to develop characters along unconventional paths, as it emphasizes unexpected and idiosyncratic aspects in them by evading the prescriptions of a mythologically pre-ordinate plot. With Pentheus, even if reference to tradition plays an important role in giving us an overall impression of the king's character, literary and mythological allusions are of a different nature and effect from allusions in other plays. Interaction with the body of myths known to the public is indeed characteristic of the tragic genre. As Halleran has shown, tragic re-elaboration of traditional myth always goes further than inert imitation.6 Often, allusion to the road not taken in reporting a traditional tale intensifies the chosen version: Halleran gives the example of Aeschylus' Agamemnon , where the chorus alludes to Iphigenia's sacrifice. Here only a 'terrible hint' of the girl's fate is given, and the chorus conclude: 'what happened next I did not see, nor do I relate it; I but the arts of Calchas are not unfulfilled' (248-49). The audience is reminded of another version of the story (Iphigenia's translation to the land of the Taurians, alive), different from the one followed by Aeschylus (Iphigenia's death); the irreparability and brutality of the second is highlighted by comparison with the first.7 Reference to different versions of the same myth, and the manipulation of the gaps between them with an effect of suspense or intensification is typical of the tragic genre} Halleran adds that 'in addition to the issue of authorial control of one's narrative - and allusions - we must also address questions of mythological fixity';9 this means that authorial control and the codification of a certain myth share a balance of power over the plot, which can tip in favour of one or s See Grube (1935) 41, Winnington-Ingram (1969) 127, Oranje (1984) 44, Verdenius (1988) 246, Roth (1984) 61. Roux (1972) 44-47, conversely, reads the figure of Teiresias as a fair and solemn advocate of religious cult (as already Kitto, 1961, 375), disregarding the comic cast of the whole scene and identifying the 'sophistry' of the play solely in Pentheus (on this point Seidensticker 1978, 310-11 is more illuminating). 6 Halleran (1997). 7 Halleran (1997) 162. On Euripides' rewriting of Iphigenia's myth, and pre-existing versions of her survival to the sacrifice see Cropp (2000) 45-46. 8 However, see Stinton's reservations (1990) 454: 'in so far as an allusion was dramatically important, the [tragic] poet made it readily understandable, obscure or oblique allusions being correspondingly of little or no importance for the understanding of the play as a play'. &lt;J Halleran (1997) 156.</page><page sequence="174">166 HIDDEN PATHS the other. The more fixed a story is, the less allusive and controlling the authorial hand in the play, and vice versa. In Bacchae this procedure of allusion is operative, but to a greater extent than in the example from Agamemnon (not least because of the originality of Euripides' re- elaboration of the myth of Pentheus).10 The pre-existing mythological pattern to which Pentheus is connected is theomachia.u From the beginning of the play we can detect allusions to this model.12 At 337-40 Cadmus compares his grandson to Actaeon, and at 1291, talking to his daughter, he finds the figura completed after the king's death.13 At 45 Dionysus introduces Pentheus as the one 'who fights against my divine power', os* 0eo[iaxeî to kot ' è'ié. The god says this in the prologue, when the king has not yet done anything wrong;14 notwithstanding this,15 allusion forces us to read him, not so much as a theomachos, but against the figure of an ordinary theomachos. From this comparison, one is led to note Pentheus' lack of conviction, for instance, as against a figure like Euripides' Hippolytus, or his lack of adult independence from the judgement of others, as against a figure like the Sophoclean Ajax. Agave's reference to the son she has just slaughtered, at 1255-56, as to one who 'only knows how to fight against the gods' (0€Oļj.ax€LV [lóvov I oíos* T ' 6K6ÎV09), sets up a final ironic contrast between Pentheus and these figures. The way that this model is hinted at before Pentheus' entrance onstage (at 45) is a sign of strong authorial control; and yet, we are not made to feel the anticipation but only the final effect, namely that Pentheus is a very extraordinary theomachos , even a parody of one. This interplay of myth and character involves a continuous confrontation. Pentheus' eagerness to see, again, forces the audience to think of other mythological episodes of 'seeing the forbidden', and perhaps to note how relatively innocent, in the end, is Pentheus' desire to watch the women of his family.16 10 See Chapter III, p. 137 n. 135. Olson (1990) analyses Bacchae' s re-elaboration of the 'hero-pattern' as described by Raglan (1956), concluding that in our play 'there is a disruption in the standard Hero Pattern', which is followed by Dionysus and by Pentheus, who becomes the god's 'dramatic double' (27). Bacchae 'is thus the product of a sophisticated literary re-working of an old folk-tale pattern' (27). 11 The model of theomachia is undoubtedly very important for tragedy, as analysed by Kamerbeek (1948). However, in Bacchae this model seems to be the pretext for the revelation of Pentheus' character, and not the reverse as in traditional version. 12 Cf.

A useful formulation of this feature is Stahl's 'extra-dramatic scenes'.18 Stahl formulated the concept of 'extra-dramatic' communication, which takes place in scenes in which no advancement of plot is reached through the dialogue, yet an effect of characterization is achieved overall.19 Such scenes are particularly apparent in Euripides. In a world like his (in Stahl's words), 'where is there room for the man of action, for the dramatic deed? There can be none. Studies of Euripides' dramaturgy confirm that he sought increasingly to withdraw from his characters the possibility of action. The people of his plays become passive; external action is replaced by internal reaction'.20 At the end of an extra-dramatic scene the plot is at the same point as it was before; in the meantime, 'the two communicating characters pick up the plot and, in a contrary-to- fact movement, lead it on into irreality'.21 These types of scene, even though typical of Euripides, are also found in Homer and in other tragic texts. In Bacchae , however, the extra-dramatic seems to become determinative. If one compares our play, from a dramaturgical point of view, with other late-Euripidean plays, like Orestes , what is striking is the simplicity of Bacchae' s plot. Most of our play is not in the events but in the 'characterful' communication taking place between or beyond events - the hallucination scenes, for example, are extra-dramatic scenes par excellence. The two long sequences of stichomythia between the god and the king, likewise, do not add much to the plot but deepen the representation of Pentheus' character. Therefore, while in Aeschylus the portrayal of characters is almost superimposable onto their behaviour, in Bacchae , if we judged Pentheus from his actions, we would have at first a misleading impression (he is yet another arrogant tyrant) and ultimately an impression of the incomprehensible, or the inconsistent. To conclude, Pentheus' character as we perceive it is not merely the effect of his deeds - as for an Aeschylean character - but of a more complicated tissue of literary functions and effects, associated with textual illusion and the interplay of key- words and images.22 17 This means that, far from being 'exhaustively contained in his behavioural utterances' as above, Pentheus' character contains them and even departs from them. See Dunn (1996) 9: 'we find that the work of ... [Euripides] anticipates the novel both in its insistent concern with the problem of closure, and in the particular form of narrative openness it explores' . IX Stahl (1977). "Stahl (1977). 20 Stahl (1977) 161. 21 Stahl (1977) 176. 22 Or what we shall refer to as 'enactment of images' (we have identified the same phenomenon in the tying- freeing motif: see II.3, pp. 103-05 and below IV.6.2, pp. 204-05).</page><page sequence="176">168 HIDDEN PATHS 4.1.4 Character development In the light of our description of character in Bacchae as constructed beyond plot, myth and action it is possible, at last, to talk about development of character in respect of the narrative strategy of the play. To say that a character 'develops', as Silk points out, is only possible within a realist tradition, and it would be naïve to apply this notion to ancient tragedy without qualification.23 By comparison with earlier tragedy, however, we can note that a sequence of stages, in our play, marks the decision making of Pentheus and the turn of events. We shall contrast these with the different modalities of decision-making in Homer and tragedy which we analysed in Chapter I. There we concluded, against Snellian readings of decision-making in early Greek literature, that in Homer, Aeschylus and (partly) Sophocles, decisions are taken in alignment with 'the world' rather than as unfathomable expressions of the self as according to a post-Cartesian conception,24 so that we have the impression that in Homer characters simply communicate the result of their change of mind, or that in Aeschylus second thoughts are regarded as a negative indication of weakness. In Bacchae we find dramaticity and 'freedom of action' for characters, in the sense of freedom from normative rules of the genre - meaning, again, established mythological plots and 'types'. We note an openness of plot which is unprecedented in tragedy, as noted by Burnett.25 Crucial examples are the change in Dionysus' stated programme and the way that Pentheus is 'shown to have a terrible freedom in his refusal to learn, but the god, after all, is no less free'.26 Dionysus takes real decisions and changes his mind, just as Pentheus does. Real staged decision leads to concrete consequences. Pentheus' fall shows this clearly. The king's character undergoes what we can conveniently call 'development'; this development, rather than being linear, proceeds by an alternation of moments of rigidity with moments of change and malleability. This openness of Pentheus' character to second thought is enacted through (in)decision concerning particular facts. The qualities of permanence and compactness that inescapable events had in previous tragedies ('the world') are in Bacchae translated into traits of the character, now separated from his behaviour, as from the plot. This 'permanence' of characteristics (the fact that Pentheus, for instance, is somehow mad from the beginning of the play)27 is variously explicit: in the figurai references to Actaeon (four of them), in the presentation of the king as theomachos from the first lines of the play; and in the repeated, ominous allusions to his chthonic nature.28 The inner self of Pentheus is made of unfathomable, permanent and complex features; the events taking place are determined by his interaction with an unstable world, and could change direction at any minute. 23 Silk (2000) 214. 24 Chapter 1.6, pp. 30-41. 25 Burnett (1970) 28. 26 Burnett (1970) 28.

At 215-62 the king comes on stage, and describes his disposition and mental process, starting from his reaction to news he has just received. To what he has heard about the stranger (kXùgo, 'I hear' at 216; Xeyouai, They say' at 233, &lt;1&gt;r|ai, They say' at 242) he opposes his own firm reaction (€ÏXr|&lt;i&gt;a, T have caught them', at 226; 0r|pdaop.ai, T will hunt them', at 228; Traueret), T will stop them', at 232 and 240; Xf|iļ;o|iai, 1 will capture them' at 239). He offers his opinions on the stranger and the new rites, and displays an unshakeable rigidity towards the whole situation. Now follows his confrontation with Cadmus and Tiresias (248-369), where the two old men try in vain to change his mind. Vocatives and imperatives mark their address to him: (L veavia at 274; go uai at 330; co gx^tXi ' at 358 (compare co £év ' at 263, from the chorus): his main traits are summed up by these tags, 'young man', 'son'/'child', 'obstinate', 'stranger'. At 334 and 367-69, there are two interventions that underline Pentheus' potential for change. In the first, Cadmus suggests that Pentheus should 'tell a lie in a good cause', KaTai|;eu8ou kciXgòç, while in the second Tiresias expresses a wish: 367 TTevôeùç 8' ottgoç [if) TTévGoç daoiaei 8ófioiç Tolç aoîai, Ká8p.e* pavTiKfj pèv où Xéyco, tolç TTpaypaaiv 3iģ... May Pentheus not bring grief to your house, Cadmus. It is not by prophecy that I say this, but by the facts . . . It is clear from Cadmus' insistence in this context that Pentheus could still completely change the course of events; similarly, Tiresias is worried for the king's destiny, not by virtue of some esoteric knowledge ('by prophecy', [lavTiKfļ) - which for us, besides some superficial irony at the expense of soothsayers, means a questioning of mythological fixity - but by judging from the fact (tolç Trpdyfiaaiv) that Pentheus (in his words) [iúpa...[iajpoç Xéyei, 'being a fool he speaks foolish things' (369).29 Notwithstanding such pressures in this dialogue (343-57), as in his interview with the stranger (451-60), Pentheus remains inflexible in his decision, even though some details betray a repressed curiosity about his new opponent, if not an attraction towards him. Other characters' advice to the king, that he should not oppose the stranger, conveys the same idea of the openness and reparability of the situation, along with a new sense of suspense. At 449-50, at the end of the first servant's report of the capture of the stranger, the servant warns the king that the man has come to Thebes 'full of miracles'; however, the next decisions will be up to the king: croi 8è TdXXa xpì) M-éXeiv ('but the rest is your concern', 450). In the following dialogue between Pentheus and Dionysus (461-518), the king's rigidity is more and more infiltrated by the god's deception. At 508, Dionysus reminds his opponent: ev8uaTuxiļcxaL touvoji ' èmTfiSeioç èî, 'with respect to your name, you are fit to be unfortunate in it'. The superficial reference to some sort of predestination, though, hides the fact that, by themselves, Pentheus' stubbornness and his own hidden nature will lead him to ruin. 29 On these lines, see also Karsai (1992) 206-07.</page><page sequence="178">170 HIDDEN PATHS By 616-59 (the palace-miracle), Pentheus is bewildered and hallucinating: his rigidity remains, and his hostility to the god, but he is unable to choose the right target for his aggressiveness. Once restored to normality, the king is still firm in his resolution against the stranger and the women (660-809). In the herdsman's report, which adds more elements to Pentheus' knowledge, he is invited to change his mind, at 769-70: tòv ôatpov' ow tóvô', oanç ?ght' íL ôéaTTOTa, 770 ôéxou TTÓXÉI Trjô'... And so receive this god, whoever he is, into this city, O master . . . Attempts to convince Pentheus come at regular intervals throughout the play, and from the most varied sources; the king, however, is following an inner path of his own, and his change of mind and second thoughts, his progression from resistance to acceptance, is ultimately inner and individual, detached from external factors, advice or evidence. At 802 the king is given power to decide. We are reminded that he could still change his mind, decide to go to the mountains with an army, and return to the role of a statesman, as ambiguously pointed out by Dionysus: co Tav, er 'eanv ev KaTaoTfjaai TCXÔ6 ('sir, it is still possible to arrange these things well'). At 810-11 we have the turning point in Pentheus' relationship with Dionysus, when the god launches his frontal attack: 810 a- ßouXri acļ)' ev öpeoi anyKaGripeva? iôetv; Ah! Do you wish to see them sitting together on the mountains? Much has been commented about the enigmatic â- uttered by the god, a moment defined as 'ultimately baffling, un-fully-accountable-for by the spectators'.30 Different accounts for the quality of Dionysus' seduction have been proposed, from hypnosis to plain sexual avance. What is of interest for us here is that this luring invitation, which finally con- vinces the king, and after which his defeat is complete, is rather the only point in the play where (on the one hand) world and external suggestion and (on the other) selfhood and inner drive converge. What Dionysus is suggesting now is what Pentheus wants to hear, and the active agency of decision ends up by coinciding with the passive, deranged victim of divine revenge. What follows is the slow process of winning over the king, which is, in parallel, a process of him convincing himself against his own shame and his own self- restraints (810-61). From this point on, except for the very last lines before his death (1 1 18-21), in which, however, no 'recovery' or new awareness is made explicit, Pentheus keeps his enthusiasm and his deranged purpose to become a Maenad. The same rigidity always possesses him, with the difference that it is now applied to the (for him) unorthodox aim of celebrating the rites of Dionysus on the mountains. Here he shows various of the traits he showed before: love of detail, literalness, precision and an obsession with control. If Pentheus' destiny is increasingly fixed and decided, this decisiveness springs from his own inner emotion and intent. 30 For a review of readings of these two lines, see Buxton (1988) 45.</page><page sequence="179">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 171 An especially revealing sequence is 966-70 where, through an ambiguous antilabe , Dionysus addresses Pentheus as the victim going towards death, and the king is shown enthusiastically dreaming of his own triumph. We have here an effect of exceptional suspense: the victim is on the edge of the precipice, while Dionysus teases him to the extreme with double meanings allusive to the horrific death he is going to suffer, starting with a praise: 'you and you alone will suffer for your city' (963). T shall lead you safely there; someone else shall bring you back' 'Yes, my mother' (965-66). 'You will be carried home 'O luxury!'. 'Cradled in your mother's arms.' ' You will spoil me'.' I mean to spoil you...' (968-70), until at 971 the god finally bursts out in triumph, ôeivòç ob Ô6LVÒÇ Kam ôélv ' epxTi miOri ('amazing you are, amazing, and you are walking into amazing sufferings!'); then, he shouts to his women to urge them against their prey (973). This is the point of no return. One may say that some sort of 'suspense' is present in all tragedies where anagnorisis plays an important role, as notably in 07, or in Bacchae itself, for instance, in the later 'psychotherapy scene' between Agave and Cadmus (1233-1329). The suspense that is unique in the play, however, is different because it concerns events in their making, and not the human recognition of pre-existing truth.31 As the second servant's report shows, Pentheus maintains his stubborn and rigid motivation right up to the point when he is finally attacked by the women. At this moment (1 1 13), it is said of him, kokou... eyybs (Lu e'±ävQavev ('he understood he was close to disaster') - which leaves us to suppose that he has also realized his mistake and the risk he has deliberately chosen to run. To sum up, Pentheus is constantly presented as choosing his position, whether against or according to others' suggestions, and systematically missing occasions to change direction. This dramaticky of events - in the sense of genuine openness - is, I would argue, correlative with the representation of unconscious and permanent features of character, just as a view of the world as flawed and questioned is correlative with a representation of self as internalized and non-communicable. 4.2 Character in time These last aspects of the representation of self in our play (internalization and incommunicability) are also apparent in the narratological strategy and the presentation of time, two deeply interrelated features of any literary text, as is widely acknowledged.32 Narratological aspects such as focalization, authorial control, dramatic openness and fictional illusion influence the way time is represented, time being the arena where fiction and the reality of the audience's life meet. Equally, they influence the way character is presented in its relation to the world of the play. It is crucial, therefore, to consider time in the Bacchae as super-personal contribution to the presentation of characters in the play. 'Time', however, needs qualification. Three senses of the word interest us here. First of all, there is the view of 'time' as an abstraction offered by the text, insofar as any such concept is applicable to tragedy. Secondly, there is everyday, present time, felt and expressed by the characters as part of their life (under this heading we include elements of suspense, features of development of character, and awareness of time passing). Thirdly, 31 See below on immediacy in the presentation of events in Bacchae (IV. 2. 1, pp. 173-74). 32 See de Jong (1991) 48 on time and focalization; Goward (1999) 21-38; Dunn (1996) 3-9 and 76-83.</page><page sequence="180">172 HIDDEN PATHS there is time in the diachronic sense, on the understanding of a past and a future for characters outside the literal limits of the staged drama and the fictional life of the characters. The only significant monograph devoted to time in Greek drama is de Romilly's Time in Greek Tragedy?3 which focuses on neither of the last two concepts of time, but rather concentrates, 'internally', on the role played by time as an abstraction in its evolution within the three tragedians. And this evolution, essentially, is from a conception of time that conveys a cosmic and ethical value to one that becomes the object of a subjective evaluation. De Romilly's conclusions are that Aeschylus tends to represent time from the point of view of the gods, Sophocles from the point of view of man and Euripides 'from the standards of our sufferings'.34 Even though her perspective remains 'internal' to the text, and therefore largely exclusive of narcological insight, her remarks are a useful starting point. She claims, in particular, that in Euripides time begins to be 'applied to the single subject' (as shown, for instance, by the usage of the adjective xpóvioç, 'delaying, 'lingering', with reference to single characters);35 she argues that time begins to have an emotive ('pathetic') function, in association with Euripidean predilections such as peripeteia and coup de theatre?6 The view of time held is therefore linked to worldview; interestingly, de Romilly proposes that this Euripidean 'psychological view of time' is linked to 'religious pessimism', since trust in time as a just healer of sufferings and a fair avenger of crime is no longer tenable.37 This religious pessimism influences character representation through the 'psycho- logical view of time' it implies. Bacchae takes this relationship to an extreme; religious pessimism in the play corresponds to a presentation of time as idiosyncratically felt and lived. The chorus' lines at 888-90, whereby 'time' is personified as a 'long-distance runner' who will finally disclose truth and accomplish justice (the gods, in various ways, hide 'the long foot of time', 8apòv xpóvou Tróôa, but 'hunt the unholy', Brpcoaiv tòv aacTTTov),38 initially seem to foreground a vision of time 'from the point of view of the gods'. This, however, is immediately discredited as a claim for a superior fate redressing human guilt, as the unambitious and negative ideal of happiness (eu8aip.ovta) at 902-12 shows.39 33 De Romilly (1968). 34 De Romilly (1968) 122. 35 De Romilly (1968) 127. 36 De Romilly (1968) 130. 37 De Romilly (1968) 131. 38 See Dodds (1960) 188. 39 See de Romilly (1963) on the 'thème du bonheur' in our play, which is progressively reduced to a precarious ideal: to 8è kot' rjiiap-.^íoTOS1 I eù8ai|i(ov, paicapíCco, 'the person whose life is happy from day to day, him I call blessed' (910-11). See also van der Stockt (1999) 176 on the concept of euSaipovia ('happiness') in Bacchae as linked to reflection on the brevity of life, a comment 'pleine de résignation mélancolique'. The adjective ^aKdpios' 'blessed', appears, with a sinister irony, in Agave's enthusiastic arrival from the mountain: 'the Maenads call me "Agave the blessed'" (pdicaip ' 'Ayaurj, at 1180), and later, emphasized by repetition, when she addresses her father: 'for you are blessed, father, blessed by this great deed I have done' (paicápioç, at 1242-43).</page><page sequence="181">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 173 What de Morgues has noted is largely true, that there is a temporal aspect peculiar to tragedy, the dismissal of the everyday, prosaic sense of time passing and of its influence on the human rhythm of life and on personal feelings.40 And yet Bacchae, albeit located within the same experience as other Greek tragedies, represents a step towards a sense of time 'in its present passing', and exceeding the self-contained microcosm of the single play. It would certainly be going too far to claim for Bacchae a naturalist taste for everyday reality, but it is true that a flavour of immediacy is perceptible here, as against that quality of irreparability and the unchangeableness of time which we find in other plays. Here as elsewhere, Bacchae is distinctive. 4.2.1 Everyday time and characterization in Bacchae Everyday, present time subjectively conceived by the characters is an important element in the representation of man and world in the play. It confirms the same priority given to the personal viewpoint that we noticed in the representation of madness, or in the idiosyncratic rendering of human experiences such as seeing, being ill or hunting. Everyday time is certainly perceptible in the play, in the sense of time spent and felt irrespective of narcological delay and suspense. This works towards a representation of man no longer presented 'in the changeless, public continuity of the mask',41 but in his idiosyncratic reaction to events as they occur. In discussing character and plot, we have seen how Pentheus' change of mind takes place in time. Let us consider the crucial passage (787-861) in all its stages.42 The king's attitudes in this episode are subject to an evolutionary process, marked by temporal 'milestones' which offer us an impression of immediacy. First comes the offer of the god (ßooXi]...;, 'do you wish...') at 811. Then, after Pentheus' assent, he asks him tí 8 yelç epura Toû8e ttctttgokcls* piyav; ('how have you fallen into this desire?') at 813, hinting at some change which has taken place before our eyes, and at 815, öpo)? 8't8oiç âv qôécoç ä croi mKpá; ('and yet you would enjoy seeing things that are bitter to you?') 43 After his first hesitation, the king makes his desire apparent at 820, enthusiastically promising ay ' ùç ráxiora' toO xpóvov 8é croi (J&gt;0ovû ('as soon as possible; I grudge you the delay!'), where that last expression is a 'hasty attempt to deny the impatience the first half of the line betrays'.44 In the ensuing lines, the accessories of the dressing-up that the god is about to give the king are described as a programme, with a number of future tenses (cktcvqj, 'I will stretch', at 831; eorai, 'there will be', at 833; TTpoa0f|&lt;j£iç, 'you will add', at 834), which are also used to foresee the outcome of the expedition (alp.a 0f|a£iç, 'you will 40 See Gould (1987a) 49 and Chapter I, p. 28 with n. 1 17. 41 Gould (1987a) 49. Cf. above, Chapter II.2.1, p. 88, where we read the motif of disease in the play as connected to a new, 'Hippocratic' concern with time in the play. 42 Van der Stockt (1999) analyses this temporal quality of the play (see esp. 168-74, 'Le temps structurant les Bacchantes' ): the fate of Pentheus unfolds as an 'évolution naturelle' (168). 43 Here Di Benedetto (2004) 404 detects a play on the part of Dionysus on the potentially ambiguous word flôéwç, 'gladly', idiomatic expression of consent which for Pentheus might denote only 'availability', not 'pleasure', but is taken by the god as betraying desire - see elç epomi, '[you have fallen] into a great passion', at 813. 44 Translation and note to line 820 in Dodds (1960).</page><page sequence="182">174 HIDDEN PATHS create bloodshed', at 837), the plan (iftev, 'we shall go' and èyco 8 ' fļyfļao|iai, 'I will lead you', at 841; ßouXeuao|iai, 'I will deliberate', at 843b; TTopetjaopai, I will proceed', and TTÉiaopai, 'I will obey', at 845 and 846), and Dionysus' menacing predictions for the victim.45 These foreseeing future tenses and the accumulation of contemporaneous staged actions46 deliver a sense of dramatic urgency, with moments of choice filled with consequences, which are repeatedly reconfirmed and lead Pentheus far away from where he was, 6K tûv àTTÉiXûv tûv upiv alai Seivoç fļv ('away from the earlier threat with which he was so frightening', 856). At 843, Pentheus replies to the god's insistence with an undertaking to 'think about it', (av 8okt1 ßouXeuaoiiai), assuring himself of a way of delaying his decision and keeping control (illusory control, in fact) over the situation. Shortly afterwards, at 845-46, he again emphasizes the fact that he is in control: QTÉixoip. 'av f' yàp ottX' 6xtov Tropeuaopai f| Total aotai TTÉiaopai ßouXeupaaiv. I think I will go in; for either I will proceed armed, or I will obey your counsels. The use of the verb in the future expresses Pentheus' conviction that he is in charge of the situation, and still in the position of changing his path at will. If this perception of time as idiosyncratic and personally felt is a feature of Bacchae , the play also offers the flash-back of everyday, familial past, in Cadmus' personal recollections of Pentheus' affection for him as a grandson, at 1308-22: to ÔÍJÒ1JL ' aV6ßX£&lt;J&gt;' ÒÇ &lt;JVVeïX€Ç, to T6KV0V, Toupòv jiéXaGpov, ttoliSòç épfjs- yeytoç, 1310 TTÓXei T6 Tapßos* fjaGa* tòv yépovTa ôè ovôelç ußptieiv fļ0£X' elaopův tò aòv Kápa* Siiaļv yap à£iav eXapßaves1. vOv 8' £K 8Ó1IC0V aTip.09 eKß£ßXf)(JO|iai ó Ká8poç ó piyaç, oç tò 0r|ßaLtov yévoç 1315 ecnreipa Kà£f|pr|(ja KáXXicrrov Gépoç. to (1&gt;iXTaT ' àv8pœv (Kal yàp oùkét' oj v ôpcoç TtOV 4&gt;tXTàTtOV êpoiy' àpi0[JLT|OT), TÉKVOV), OUK6TL yevetou ToOSē Giyyávtov x^pl tòv prjTpòç au8tov TtaTépa ttpocjtttijÇt], tékvov, 1320 Xéytov tíç à8iK£Î, tiç a' àTipà£ei, yépov; Tiç afiv Tapáaaa Kap8iav Xvnripòç aiv; Xéy' d)?

Who disturbs your heart by being troublesome? Tell me, so that I may punish the one who wrongs you, o father'. Pentheus was the point of reference of the house and the defender of the family (1308-09); he would defend Cadmus, an old man, from any threats or bullying. He would gently ask the old man to tell him what was wrong, 'touching with his hand this chin' (1318). This intrusion of the everyday into the 'normative' dimension of tragic characterization is not completely new - one might think of Clytemestra's memory of baby Orestes sucking her breast, in an attempt to move him to mercy at Choephori 896-98, or the nanny in the same play (at 749-62) recalling in practical detail her care for the child. However, the episode in Bacchae offers a longer and wider development of the evocation of the absent person, joining the everyday with a real flash-back, even using direct speech.47 This kind of three- dimensional evocation requires strong authorial control and illusion. Cadmus also refers to feelings that will exceed the limits of presence or absence within the plot: Kai yàp OÙK6T' ojv opcoç I Ttov ^lXtcitgov 6|ioty ' àpi0|if|crq, T6KV0V, 'for although you no longer exist you will nevertheless be counted among those dearest to me, child' (1316-17).

The younger tragedian even includes dialogue in narratives, with an effect of greater dramaticity, pathos and immediacy. This Euripidean tendency is most apparent in Bacchae , when the second messenger reports Pentheus' panicking appeals for his mother's mercy in direct speech (at 1 1 18-21: see below, p. 177). 48 Goward (1999) 33.

Here facts are not so much Talked about', as actually happening onstage. Contrast, for instance, the scene of Jocasta's suicide in Sophocles' OT (1237-85), where the queen's offstage death and Oedipus' blinding are narrated in perfect and aorist tenses, and presented as concluded facts.49 Closer to the killing of Pentheus in the Bacchae is the famous infanticide passage in Medea (1271-81), where the chorus is left outside, helpless, to hear the screaming children slaughtered by their mother inside the house. The scene begins with the children's reaction of terror (io) |ioi, 'help me!', at 1270a), and continues with the coryphaeus's angst at the children's dramatic cries for help (1271-76, Xo. àKOveiç ßoav àicoúeiç TéKP(ov;|...TTai. oïpoi, ti ôpdaœ; ttol &lt;J&gt;irycú pr|Tpòç x¿Pas;l...óXXi&gt;pe&lt;j0a yáp.

'Shall I enter the house? I'm determined to stop the death of the children').50 The scene is thus presented through a 'live commentary' given by the chorus, characterized by present tenses, with high tension and great immediacy. Details of the killing are however spared; in the analogous passage in Ba. 1043-152, when the second messenger reports Pentheus' killing, the vividness of the scene reaches the extreme, even if through an account rather than being directly staged. The attack against Pentheus is described in detail, and a dialogue between the victim and the mother is also reported in direct speech (1118-21): ..'.Eyco toi, pfļT6p, e'ipL, Trais* oéQev TTevGeús1, ov ej€K€Ç ev Sopoi^'Extovos** 1120 oÏKTipe 8' ¿o ļifļT6p [i€ |ir|8è Tais* épais* ápapTiaiai rraî8a aòv KaTaKTávqç. Look, it is I, mother, your child Pentheus, whom you bore into the house of Echion. Pity me, o mother, and do not through my errors kill your child. Even in the narrative of a past event, we are made to feel the immediacy of the critical moment, when the mother looks at her son, 'dripping foam and rolling her twisted eyes, not thinking as she should think', and yet he 'did not persuade her', oü8 ' 6ttéi0€ viv (1124). We hear Pentheus' panic-stricken appeals to his mother's maternal feeling over four lines, which give us an impression of an oddly different character from the one who left the stage in the preceding scene. De Jong's reading of narrative in Euripides offers a helpful general formula, of which Bacchae , however, represents an extreme case. Her discussion of messenger speeches as 49 Another element working towards 'immediacy', the reduced length of the scenes, was identified by van der Stockt (1999) 161 n. 20: 'on constate qu'il y a beaucop de scènes dans les Bacchantes et qu'elles sont relative- ment courtes, surtout à la fin. Cela donne l'impression d'une action qui s'accélère, et qui, à la fin, en arrive à un rythme assez rapide... comme cela semble normal dans les dernières pièces d'Euripide'. 50 1271-76 is a problematic passage, with two lines possibly missing - see Page (1938) 170-71 .</page><page sequence="186">178 HIDDEN PATHS first-person narratives, endowed with a subjective, focalizing function, is helpful in this respect. She notes how the temporal level foregrounded by these narratives is generally the 'experiencing focalization', the viewpoint of the participant to the event. Historic present is the characteristic tense in such narratives,51 where events are presented 'in chronological order, without prolepses or...analepses, retroversions'.52 This 'naturalism' of narrative insertion is one contributory factor to the more marked fictional illusion that we find in Euripides; it brings Euripides closer to Homeric practice (that is, to narrative proper) than to the other two tragedians - another sign of stronger authorial control. In fact, a potentiality of narrative is to offer total control over the material, a 'granted definiteness' as opposed to the more elusive 'concreteness' of drama, as Goffman explains. And with its definiteness, the intrusion of everyday time is strongly influential on character representation, since in drama 'there is no possibility of making more than provisional assumptions about the stage characters. As in life, nothing is stable beyond basic definitions... [whereas] authors of no vels... assume and are granted definiteness; what they say [about their characters] is accepted as fully adequate and true'.53 This means that in Bacchae , where Pentheus in particular is concerned, we are led to take for granted the existence of a deep psychological life under the surface of events. 4.2.2 Diachronie time and character In the last section we have seen excess of character out of its textual limits - a sort of internal, synchronic depth. Complementary to that is a diachronic excess, the extension of a character's life beyond the temporal limits of the play. Narratological studies have given considerable attention to this aspect of narratological time, and have tended to single out Euripides as against the other two playwrights. We shall briefly consider the development from Aeschylus to Euripides, then focus on Euripides himself and finally on Bacchae. Interesting remarks on extra-fictional time are offered by Goward in her extended study of tragic narrativity.54 She notes that temporality in ancient drama is articulated in terms of a dialectic between synchrony and diachrony, with synchrony characterizing the lyrics and their tendency to involve temporal leaps, and diachrony characterizing the iambics and their greater immediacy. An opposition between Aeschylus on the one hand, and Sophocles and Euripides on the other, is correlative to the integration that we see, in the older tragedian, between the mythical heroes and the world evoked in the lyrics as against the world of the play (which is, itself, less modernized than in the younger tragedians). Instead, in Sophocles and Euripides we see a deeper separation between the personages involved in the plot and the achronic lyrics which allude to other narratives, creating a 'gap between the "now" of the stage figures ... and the timeless voice of traditional community wisdom which is the repository of tales'.55 M De Jong (1991) 38-39. 52 De Jong (1991) 46. 53 Goffman (1974) 152. 54 Goward (1999). 55 Goward (1999) 23.</page><page sequence="187">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 79 Prophecies and dreams as means of prolepsis have been also considered by Goward, who explores the fact that, in Aeschylus, material from the past and the future is presented through the focalization of a character rather than in a prologue, as opposed to Euripides' practice, whereby proleptic devices placed within the body of the play are almost absent.56 For us, these findings are meaningful in two senses. In the first place, the presence of dreams or oracles acknowledged by all characters is, in Aeschylus, part of a shared language of common understanding,57 which tends to integrate character into plot. An example is Choephori 549-50, where Orestes interprets his mother's dream and identifies himself with the avenging snake: 6KÔpaKOVTGo0eiç 8' èyù KT61VCÜ VIV, (I)Ç TOÜVeipOV 6VV6TT61 TÓSÉ. I have been made into the snake, and I am to kill her, as this dream tells. Orestes thus confirms his participation in the same metaphysical frame as his mother, and as the other characters - here the chorus, whom he is addressing. The sharing of the same image and the same level of communication ensures all the characters' adherence to a strongly framed systemic world, within which their behaviour is straightforwardly understood. Secondly, from a narratological point of view, the confinement of prolepsis to the formal frame of the play (the prologue), which Goward identifies as characteristic of Euripides, reinforces fictionality and a strong sense of authority governing the presentation of events from the outside: the 'non-naturalistic' narrative device - prolepsis - is kept apart from the stage events, so that fictional illusion is left untouched. In this way, 'lacking oracles or dreams to work on, the stage figures have no possibility of understanding the divine will',58 and the audience are also left without any legitimate means of foreseeing the development of events. The formally defined closing strategy that we find in Euripides enforces the same sense of narrative authority: at the end of most plays we find closing devices, usually involving an aition , or a narrative, or both. The fact that the greater formal definiteness in framing is made necessary by the actual 'openness' of the events which are coming to a conclusion (as Goward puts it, the need 'to guarantee that the audience know that the action is over')59 may seem contradictory, but only at first sight. The two aspects both reinforce fictionality. The body of the play, 'artificially' delimited by prologue and 56 Goward (1999) 64; 122. See also de Jong (1991, 45ff.), who explores the way that elements of 'omniscience' - even if only a self-styled, fraudulent omniscience - are confined to prologue and epilogue. 57 This aspect will be analysed in detail below (IV.5, pp. 196-201). 58 Goward (1999) 151. 59 Goward (1999) 123. On the Euripidean prologue and closing devices, cf. Nietzsche's scathing remarks in Birth of Tragedy §12: 'Euripides believed he had noticed that the spectators were peculiarity restive during those first scenes as they tried to work out the story so far... this is why he places the prologue before the exposition... in the mouth of a character who can be trusted, often a deity. . .[and] makes use of the same divine truthfulness again, at the end of his drama, in order to reassure the public about the future of his heroes; this is the task of the infamous deus ex machina*.</page><page sequence="188">180 HIDDEN PATHS closures, is left free for the development of 'new narrative trajectories',60 which explore surprise and reversal as the stuff of human life.61 Inter alia , the strong fictional frame facilitates implicit, unconscious characterization, as is apparent in Bacchae : in our play the prologue is formally very authoritative (being recited by a god), but it will be only partly fulfilled by facts, leaving the subsequent events ultimately at the mercy of the characters' choices. The special importance of closing devices in Euripides is argued by Dunn in a monograph devoted to the endings of Euripidean plays.62 His analysis, despite some forced claims,63 has an important bearing on the issue of fictionality as linked to formal closure and openness of the plot. Such elements as deus ex machina , aition and coda authorize the end, and corroborate control on the part of the author; the aition articulates a connection between the dimension of the play and the real world of the audience - but perhaps a pretended connection, which therefore underlines the 'fabrication process'.64 In this fashion, the world of the viewer instantiates the fiction, and conveys a stronger sense of fictional illusion. Roberts, too, analyses Euripides' conventional codas - in particular the famous TroXXai popral Ttov ôaipovtajv... ('many are the forms of divine things...') that we find in Bacchae too (1388-92). Whereas these codas are often suspected of spuriousness or dismissed for their repetitiveness, triviality and generality, Roberts defends their importance - or rather their important lack-of-importance: 'the very inadequacy of codas contributes to closure, puts a stop to infinite extension';65 and, we may add, in so doing, they make infinite extension possible, but within the well-defined limits of fictionality. The functionally equivalent deus device works in the same way. As Dunn reminds us: 'whereas the epilogue speaker in Gay and Shakespeare explicitly breaks the dramatic illusion by exposing an actor or an author, the deus in Euripides is a more conventional participant in the action; if there is a breach in dramatic illusion, it is only implied'.66 At the risk of suggesting too linear a development, we may say that in Aeschylus and (earlier) Sophocles the tendency seems to be to offer stories with an end: if not an end of events, an end of pertinence, so to speak. The temporally 'centrifugal' elements are entrusted to the chorus' digressive flights (prolepsis) and to such devices as oracles, dreams, prophecies and omens, which are integrated within the characters' experienced feelings (prolepsis and analepsis). The end of a play here represents the absolute bottom line for what we can know of the fictional life of the characters. There are no references to an articulate future ahead (except, naturally, at the beginning or in the body of a trilogy, as 60 Go ward ( 1 999) 126. 61 Goward ( 1 999) 125, 127. 62 Dunn (1996). 63 For instance, that there is a correlation between narrative temporality in tragedy and the alleged fact that 'the Greeks conceived of time as a circle' (Dunn 1996, 78). 64 Dunn (1996) 57; 46. 65 Roberts (1987). See also Beye (1982) 28, on Euripides' 'tag endings': 'their very thin generality betokens their function as form rather than meaning'. 66 Dunn (1996) 29.</page><page sequence="189">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 8 1 for PV or Agamemnon). Our sympathetic identification with the character in the aftermath of the action is impeded. In many Euripidean plays, instead, we have a resolving deus ex machina who offers the solution to the situation, or the clear outcome at least.67 This can take place through a command, an aition , a rite, an explanation:68 for instance, in Heraclidae the establishment of Eurystheus' oracle on his tomb as protection for the Athenians; in Medea , the foundation of a cult in her name; in Hecuba , Hecabe's metamorphosis into a bitch; in Andromache , Thetis' prediction to Peleus about the dynasty which will descend from Andromache and Helenus; the weddings promoted by Apollo in Orestes. This 'sealing' of the play's ending sets Euripides aside from 'traditional' tragedy; by offering an artificially strong frame, greater three-dimensionality and re-elaboration is authorized within the given limits of the text. The results are summed up by any number of critical character- izations of Euripidean dramaturgy overall: 'anti- Aristotelian' tendency,69 'poly tonality', 70 'multi-perspective drama' which often gives an impression of 'openness', and the 'difficulty of grasping "the meaning" of a play'.71 As far as the insertion of the plot into time is concerned, Euripides' plays follow one of these two paths. Either there is clear-cut delimitation, in the shape of an oracle or a prediction, as in the examples above (a precise reference to the future, but conventionally made by an external element); or else a shaded openness, where we are not given a fixed term (an oracle, or whatever: something in the future outside the plot), but instead we are made to envisage the natural progression of the present situation from an internal element - the characters' feelings. This is the case with Troades and Alcestis. In Troades , the closing lines open a door and guide us towards a future of slavery (1327-32): Ek.

Good fortune is mine and I will not deny it. This second Euripidean model, which has much in common with modern novelistic procedure, betrays a vision of fictional events as segments of a linear whole, 'constituents of a more formless and realistic continuum' J2 This sketch of Euripidean tendencies helps us to place the structure of Bacchae. Reflecting, as it does, a wider development in the tragedian's practice, our play certainly takes these tendencies to an extreme. The close of the play offers us a personal reflection on a realistic future from the point of view of Cadmus and Agave; but it is prompted by and parallel to the god's conventional and external sentence of punishment, albeit finally exceeding it. The future envisaged is centred, in fact, on the suffering characters' destinies more than it is mechanically sealed by the god's words; as with the prologue, the conventionality of Dionysus' final pronouncement leaves room for the characters' feelings and reactions. At this point Dunn is surely misled in his reading of the play, when he claims that in Euripides' surviving plays the prologue-speaker and the epilogue-speaker are never the same god, and that 'this is true even in Bacchant Women, which begins with Dionysus in his mortal guise as the "Stranger", and ends with his entrance as a god'.73 In point of fact, the prologue is recited by Dionysus as a god - who specifically insists on his decision to disguise his divine nature. And precisely because of his two external interventions, prologue and final speech (whether ex machina or not), the play is encircled in a frame, which both gives us a sense of narrative closure and authorial control, and also contrives to elide authorial omniscience, with the audience left with the suggestion of a truthful and divine-omniscient perspective on incontrovertible facts. On this ambivalence, however, a third impression is superimposed. Arguably, the unreliability of the god's introductory lines is a subtle form of dolos , as discussed by Goward, who characterizes it as 'Machiavellian'.74 From the contrast between the 'programme' displayed by the god and the subsequent development of his behaviour and, indeed, the development of the plot as a whole, the malicious character of his information is made overt. Three points in particular are highlighted by Goward as the high points of Dionysus' suggestio falsi:15 '1) his promise to have come to show himself; 2) the suggestion that the city under arms might attempt to bring the women back; 3) that Dionysus will then oppose them, also in arms [laiváai aTpaTqXaTûv, 'I will 72 Dunn (1996) 66. 73 Dunn (1996) 29 n. 10; 206. 74 Goward (1999), 157ff. On the manipulative quality of this prologue, cf. also Hamilton (1978) 301-02, Verdenius (1980) 11-13; March (1989) 38: 'I suggest that the most satisfactory explanation for this strong discrepancy is that in the prologue Euripides was referring to the familiar version of the legend, and was leading the audience on to expect this as his conclusion too, so that his new version of Pentheus' death would have an even stronger effect'; likewise Segal (1992) 95: 'in the Bacchae Dionysus' epiphany-like presence at Thebes seems to assure his authority, but the events which he predicts do not occur quite as the god describes them'. See finally Lowe (2004), who explores 'the choice and handling of the narrator' as 'closely associated with the distinctive Euripidean exploration of issues of power' (279; see especially 270-73 on the 'gaps and ambiguities' in the accounts offered by Euripidean prologues). 75 Goward (1999) 158-59.</page><page sequence="191">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 83 join battle at the head of the Maenads', at 52)'. The play, in the event, offers a rather different story, which prompts three questions: '1) in what following scene or scenes does Dionysus show himself to be a "born god", and how does his reference to manifestation relate to his disguise?;76 2) why mention the city of Thebes with weapons , when eventually we see only Pentheus unarmed going to his doom? 3) why the suggestion of the un- military Dionysus involved in military conflict?' The deceptive prologue, authorized by virtue of being recited by the god, sets out a frame which will be proved inadequate by the development of events. The result is to determine dramaticity, openness and fictionality. Dramaticity and openness, in the sense that the audience is left 'orphaned' of a reliable prologue, and faces an unexpected development of events. Fictionality, because the framing prologue is integrated within the events of the play and is part of the dramatic events, rather than introducing them.77 In the event, the temporal 'absolutism' of tragedy (superimposition of plot and staged events) is challenged by various allusions to a permanence of time, within which our action is only a segment. The characters acting within this artificially delimited segment are thus able to carry a greater weight of psychological implication than would be possible in the objectified and self-contained tragedy of an Aeschylus. Consider the end of the play. In 1360-62, mourning Pentheus' death and his own destiny of exile, Cadmus envisages his future as one of everlasting suffering: 1 360 . . . ovôè TTauaopai Koučův ó TXf||jLQ)v ov8è tòv KaTaißcrnr|v 'AxépovTa ^Xeíjcras1 tìctuxos' y€vf|croļj.ai. Nor will I, wretched, cease from sufferings, nor having sailed the downward-moving Acheron become calm. His pain for Pentheus' death is such that he cannot forget it, even after death . The entire last part of the play, from Dionysus' speech on (1344-92), is a despairing reflection on the desolate future that awaits father, daughter and the city of Thebes itself. In her despair, Agave, at 1363 and 1366, wonders where she can find refuge; at 1381-87, she bids her father her last farewell, finally saying: 76 Hamilton's argument (1974), supported by Coche de la Fertè (1980, 207), is that Dionysus' plan is at least partly accomplished by the god through the palace-miracle, which he reads as 'the birth epiphany of Dionysus... the epiphany predicted in the prologue' (145-46), where 'the palace is personified as a Maenad and, like Semeie, is destroyed'. This fails to convince. The parallel between the god's birth through Semele's death and the destruction of the palace to free the imprisoned god is suggestive; however, there is no glory or constructive teaching in the miracle itself, either for Pentheus or for the Asian Maenads, and it is difficult to find any proper 'epiphanic' quality in it. MacLeod (2006) detects an accomplishment of the god's intentions to 'join in battle as general to the Maenads' against the city (Ba. 50-52) in the herdsman's account of the sparagmos of the cattle. For MacLeod this episode 'gives us a kind of microcosm of the dramatic action of the play' (578), a 'miniature paradigm' (582). 77 Here I disagree with Segal (1992) 110, who qualifies the evolution in Euripides towards the 'detached expository prologue' in a direction opposite to fictionality: '[the detached prologue] forces its audience to recognize its discontinuity with the past through the modification of familiar myths, the formal disengagement from the rest of the action, the visible crystallization of the play's own plotting, and the reminders of its literary fictitiousness ' (my italics).</page><page sequence="192">184 HIDDEN PATHS dy£T ' co TTOļiTToi pe matyi/riTas* iva CTU1i&lt;í&gt;iryá8as' Xr|4i0ļae0 * o'iKTpás*. 6X0O111L 8' OTTOU ļif|T£ Kiöaipciou êp.' ï8oi ptapòs* 1385 pf|T£ Ki0aipúv' öaaoiatv éyco, pr |8' 801 0úpaou ļai^iJi * àuáKeiTai* ßdKxais* 8' dXXaiai péXoiev.

May I go where neither polluted Cithaeron may see me, nor I may see Cithaeron with my eyes, nor yet where there is memory of a thyrus. Let them be the concern of other Bacchants. In this way Agave seals the end of the play, and gives the audience an insight into her fate, coloured by a wholly subjective positioning of herself as against 'other' Bacchic women. The play offers us both a full conclusion, a self-styled solemn ending proclaimed by the mouth of a deus , and a personalized shading into the ensuing years.78 If we look at other tragedies, as we suggested before, we note that they end either with an abrupt final exchange of lines, or with a very general, indefinite allusion to a vague future. In Bacchae we have instead a subjective contemplation of the extra-dramatic future that will be experienced as personal time. Another instance of this subjective view of time is the way that, after Dionysus has pronounced his sentence at 1330-43, Cadmus appropriates it and repeats it at 1354-62.79 Let us look at the two passages in full: Dionysus at 1330-39 Cadmus envisaging his fate at 1352-62 ü) T6KVOV, (hç €Ç ÒCIVÒV fļX0Op£V KOIKÒV TT(zvTes' au 0' ti TáXaiva aúyyovoí 8páKü)i&gt; y€vf|OT) ļi6 TaßaXcov, 8ápap re of] re aaí 6K0r)piü)0£ia ' ö^cos* àXXá^ei túttov, éyio 0' ó TXf|po)v ßapßdpous* d&lt;ļ&gt;i£opai f|v" Apeos* eaxeç ' Appovíav 0vt1tòs* yeycós*. yépcov pcToiKos*, en 8é uquotí Oéaàarov oxov Ôè póax wv, ypnauòg cos* Xévei Ató?. èç'EWâÔ' àyayâv piyd8a ßapßdptov èXas* peT' àXóxou ßapßapcov Tiyoúpevos*, crrparov.

But Ares lead against Greek altars and tombs, at the will rescue vou and Harmonia and establish vour head of spears. Nor will I. wretched, cease life in the land of the blessed. from sufferings, nor having sailed the downward-moving Acheron become calm. Cadmus repeats the predictions that Dionysus has given him, but in an order expressive of his personal preoccupations. The exile and the military campaign at the head of a barbarian horde are foregrounded, while in Dionysus' speech the accent fell first on the metamorphosis into snakes. The different emphasis in the two passages betrays the subjectivizing of the condemnation on the part of Cadmus, against the cold and distant character of Dionysus' oracle.80 Moreover, there is a revealing difference between the two conclusions: while Dionysus promises a positive epilogue at 1338-39 ('but Ares will rescue you and Harmonia, and establish your life in the land of the blessed'), Cadmus (after acknow- ledging the same) points to the end of his sufferings on earth with a sense of despair, at 1360-62: he will never 'stop suffering'. This very odd inconsistency seems almost to reproduce the difference between the mechanical fixity of received myth, as formulated in Dionysus' rigid sentence of punishment, and the personal, human perception of facts, which does not allow Cadmus to 'ever find peace' after what has happened. Divine pronouncement is no longer sufficient to redress man's misfortune, or to have the last word on events: that 'last word' is up to the characters' feelings. To sum up, in Bacchae , partly in line with tendencies shown in other plays, Euripides structures the organization of the play with a strong authorial hand in such a way as to ensure that the single character's viewpoint emerges, through idiosyncratic excess, from the constraints of mythological prescription and from a fixed, flat dramatic time. The per- ception of characters becomes foregrounded, and is ultimately detached from the substan- tive plot.81 This is in line with Bacchae's notable presentation of characters as unique 80 Personal re-elaboration of prophecy - a rift between 'rļGoc and batpoiv' ('character' and 'destiny') - is a Euripidean trait. Compare the closing lines of Electra , where an articulate prophecy is delivered by the Dioskuroi to Orestes and Electra (1238-91), a prophecy which contains a final ransom for both, the assolution of Orestes by the Areopagos (1265-67), and the wedding of Electra to Pylades (1249). There is no consolation for the two brothers, whose attention is all focused on the pain of exile (1314-15) and the excruciating parting that awaits them. It is interesting to note here, with Di Benedetto (2004, 436; 466; 485) that Cadmus' character appears completely 're-structured' in the final scene of the play, by comparison with the first scene with Tiresias and Pentheus. Cadmus, evoked as 'old man from Sidone' (at 1025, however deleted by Middendorf), without name or patronymic, has now dismissed his enthusiastic advocacy of Dionysism, and faces a hard come-back to reality. 81 This point is reinforced by Verdegem's analysis of Bacchae* s plot as unusually comprising two structural climaxes, one with Dionysus' â outcry at 810, and one with Agave's recovery at 1264.

First, a deeper inner life of the characters is hinted at. Second, their perception of time and events contradicts and escapes from the constraints of a rigidly construed mythological plot. 4.3 On metatheatre In the last section we resorted in passing to two critical notions, taking them as narratological conditions for the idiosyncratic and 'layered' presentation of character peculiar to our play, but without granting them specific theoretical attention: fictionality and authorial control. We shall now give them their due attention, in connection with an allegedly important or even paramount aspect of the play, which has been used by many readers to interpret Bacchae, most notably by Segal in his account of 'Dionysiac poetics': the metaliteral or, specifically, the metatheatrical.82 The assessment of a metaliterary dimension is crucial, if one is to appreciate the representation of man in a literary work. Metaliterariness, when present to the audience's perception, determines the whole world of the text. In particular, by hindering any naturalistic identification on the part of the audience, it tends to allow only a limited show of psychological depth. Psychological depth, as we have seen, is conditional on fictional illusion, where a strong authorial control elides or conceals the fictional nature of events. Quite simply, the whole critical construction of metatheatre in Bacchae tends to undermine my claims about characterization in the play: a play with fictional illusion, sometimes proposed as one of the signs of Euripidean 'modernity' and 'sperimentalism', would contradict the features which have emerged as distinctive of characterization in the play - among which, notably, we can quote unawareness of characters, the problematization of seeing and being seen, the role reversal in hunting - reducing them to playful sophistications. First of all, let us define as 'metatheatrical' a work, or part of a work, in which a playwright uses a self-reflexive allusion to, or awareness of, the fictional medium to comment on the nature of the work of art. The work of art is thereby conceived in abstraction from, and opposed to, the continuum of life within and beyond the work; the work itself becomes a potential object of reflection at a remove from the continuum , with rules and with a status of reality of its own. With metatheatre in general, the fictional contract is, if not broken, made loose. The metatheatrical, however, also subsumes objective allusions to the medium (as, for example, a film in which people go to the cinema), where allusion does not in itself jeopardize fictional illusion. Critics of Bacchae who claim a metatheatrical quality for the play generally mean it in the first, stronger sense.83 Many readings of Bacchae have focused on the robing and disguise elements as 'meta-' features, especially in the palace-miracle and the dressing-up not make the structure of the play 'episodic', but offers a shift in focus from Pentheus to Agave, determining two emotional peaks and giving the play 'an uncommonly strong emotional impact' (Verdegem, 2001 , 20). 82 Segal (1985; 1997a, 215-71). 83 Clearly spelt out by Segal (1986) 73: 'in the Bacchae Euripides has tragedy act out, in the visual form of dramatic representation, its own illusion-creating processes of masking, robing, and fiction-making... the scene mirrors back to the audience their own willingness to endow an actor on the stage with the personage of a mythical being merely by virtue of the mask and robes with which the poet clothes him'.</page><page sequence="195">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 87 scene, or else on the beheading of Pentheus as symbol of a mask. The referential aspect of these elements cannot be denied.84 Metatheatre proper, however, as our definition suggests, centres not on the content of an allusion, but on its thrust ,85 which allows only a partial 'suspension of disbelief. In Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author?6 for instance, the paramount reflection on fiction, theatre and life renders the illusion of fiction weak and characterization artificial. Bacchae surely is far removed from this. Notwithstanding arguable allusions to theatrical practice in the text, we should see Bacchae as closer to modern narrative fiction than all other extant tragedies, at the opposite end of the spectrum from Aeschylus. In Aeschylean tragedy, the public is kept at a relatively more superficial level of 'suspension of disbelief.87 A more explicit case comparable to Bacchae , to give an example from modern drama, is the expedient of inserting a dramatic representation within the dramatic representation, as in Shakespeare's Hamlet. This does not weaken the fictional contract, but perhaps even corroborates it, by including its own medium in the fiction. In his article on this aspect of the play, as well as in his book,88 Segal analyses the parallels between our text and the whole tragic experience, claiming that the poet in Bacchae 'exploits the tension between the religious meaning of the epiphany and its more intellectualized significance as a literary symbol of tragedy'.89 Examining the scenes cited above, Segal believes that 'the repeated verbs for "seeing" in the so-called palace-miracle (591-607) call attention to dramatic illusion per se and the possible discrepancy between what actually is there and what appears to be';90 in the dressing-up scene, the robing 'is a metatragic symbol... [which] represents the power of the tragic mask to reveal a truth hidden beneath surface appearance and to disclose an identity of opposites beneath apparent differentiation',91 and the whole scene is 'a microcosm of the illusion-creating effects of the drama itself'.92 In a post-structuralist spirit, Segal finally identifies Dionysus in the play as both 'a character amongst characters' and 'a privileged symbol', 'both an object of the process of symbol-making and the process itself, both a signifying term in the symbolic representation of reality and a principle of the controvertibility of objects into symbols'.93 The mask then becomes perhaps the most eloquent visualization of those functions, 'symbol of both the "pure presence" of Dionysus and of the elusiveness of that presence'.94 In this fashion, the fabrication rather than the final result is highlighted - as 84 In this sense, Seaford also acknowledges an attention to elements of theatricality in the play as function of ritual (1994, 272-74; 1998a). 85 Cf. Rosen meyer' s judgement on such readings of our play: 'not every play-within has something to say about the play around it or on the business of theatre in its setting' (Rosenmeyer 2002, 100). 86 Pirandello (1921). 87 See below IV. 5, pp. 197-98 on 'naturalistic expectation about a character's expressions', and 1.9, p. 56 n. 200. 88 Segal (1985; 1997a, 215-71).

Inter alia , Segal and others97 seem not to have pondered whether metaliterature in the strict sense is possible except in reaction to an age in which fictional illusion is dominant - unless, of course, we establish by it a readerly superimposition, which is artistically legit- imate but historically alien.98 Any metaliterary effect is achieved at the expense of illusion; it is felt against an illusion to which the audience, or reader, must be accustomed. Total fictional illusion, I would argue, had not been among the expectations of the Athenian theatrical audience. The topic is, of course, too extensive to be developed here. However, one might simply note - as a symptom - the notorious absence of consistent illusion in fifth-century comedy, or (if a more theorized position is felt to be necessary) one might profitably invoke the collision of what Finkelberg, in broad terms, calls a 'poetic of truth' and a 'poetic of fiction' within the ancient view of art: on the one hand, a vision of the poet's role as asserting external 'inspiration'; and on the other, the modern vision of the poet holding himself responsible for his work.99 The first characterizes the pre-Aristotelian conception of art as mimetic truth, with no independent life or aim (Plato's criticism of poetry is to be read on these assumptions);100 the second is a 'new poetic of fiction', which arises as alternative 'at some point in the fifth century BC'.101 The poetic of truth judges poetry by 'transcendent criteria', where the criteria of the poetic of fiction are 'immanent', meaning internal.102 An inspirational poetic of truth, as Russell rightly affirms, is found in ages 'when religious belief is strong', while a poetic of fiction appears 'when belief is questioned by rational speculation'.103 95 See Kullman (1993, 262-63): 'does a metatheatrical reading of a play not mean to distance oneself from the fictional illusion, [looking at it] from the outside?' [my translation]. 96 See Rosenmeyer (2002), especially 95-107, on what he calls the 'overload' of metatheatre in the field of classical studies. 97 E.g. Vernant (1988c) 41 1 : 'the only way of acceding to an understanding of the masked god is to enter into his game oneself. And only a tragic poet is capable of doing that, having reflected on his art, conscious of the special skills at his command, since he is past master at casting the spells of dramatic illusion', and 412: [the Bacchae] 'suggests a homology between the Dionysiac experience and the tragic representation'. 98 Note as representative Colin Teevan's translation and adaptation of the play for performance (National Theatre, 2002). Among many other things, his version emphasizes metatheatrical self-referentiality on the part of Dionysus. In the epilogue, the god asserts himself by saying: 'Do you not know me still?l In the form of a god I am revealed I god of wine, god of dramatic rites I god of the transformation from the humdrum I to the wild abandon of the play. I Look at them, do they not seem abandoned now? I And you? Was not your disbelief suspended ? Just a bit?' (my emphases). Such a translation is justified as explicitly appealing to the sensibility of a contemporary audience.

The acquisition of a poetic of fiction is a necessary condition for metatheatrical play (in Segal's sense) to be felt.105 Therefore, consequential and decisive metaliterary meaning in Bacchae is (let us suggest) not perceptible for its assumed (Athenian) audiences, for precisely the same reasons for which they find attentive ears among us. And with Bacchae , confirmation of this argument is provided by stylistic analysis of the text. 4.4 On style It is perhaps less than obvious that stylistic features such as imagery and diction impinge on the representation of character. We shall, however, endeavour to demonstrate their relevance. The topic of imagery in Greek literature is, of course, too wide to consider here in its entirety. Let us confine our analysis to two particular aspects. First, there is the very low occurrence of metaphor and simile in Euripides, in favour of what Barlow, with her extension of the term, calls 'pictorial imagery'.106 This overall Euripidean characteristic plays a central role in Bacchae in determining the disrupted communication between the characters in the play, and creating that lack of awareness which (we propose) is distinctive of their representation. The task will be explain the preference for one type of imagery as against another in terms of worldview, which is the crucial variable for the 104 The nature of this 'passage' has been explored from various points of view by recent scholarship. Despite obvious differences, two points are widely affirmed. First, there is the non-straightforward nature of 'fiction' as a theoretical concept in antiquity. Gill (1993) 87 goes so far as to claim that 'even in Plato's acknowledgements of the incomplete truth of his myths or arguments, there is no equivalent for the modem claim that the status of such discourse is "fictional"'. The second is the location of the birth of ancient poetic theory - of a view of poetry as autonomous object of investigation - late in the development of Greek literature. Representatively, Ford advocates, in a 'neo-Havelockian spirit' (Hawke 2003) that only the textualization of songs 'helped Greeks shift their criticism from evaluating songs in moral and social terms to focusing on their intrinsic formal properties' (Ford 2003, 19); it is also Ford (2002) who delineates the progress towards 'Aristotelian formalism' as leading to a view of literature as autonomous creation with an artistic value of its own, and ruled by its own technical principles. 105 One might stand my argument on its head and instance Aristophanic metatheatre against my claims. However in the tragic genre metatheatrical allusion, of the kind familiar from Old Comedy, is absent; and if present would be much more damaging for our suspension of disbelief, since the tragic genre , necessarily characterized by a more heightened emotional tension, is not as hospitable as comedy towards digression and play (compare Silk 2000, 91 and Chapter 5, especially 211-25 on the distinction between what he calls the 'realist' and the 'recreative' traditions of character representation). Then again, and more decisively, my claims concern the overall view of fiction in the classical era: the allusions in, say, Frogs or Acharnions fall under our second, wider definition of 'metatheatre'. They are explicit allusions (like people in a movie going to the cinema); they do not compel an abstraction of 'art' as separated from real life, but rather bring together art and real life, without disturbing Old Comedy's peculiar kind of integrated immersion in the staged events. See Rosenmeyer (2002) 97. 106 Barlow (1971).</page><page sequence="198">190 HIDDEN PATHS representation of character. Secondly, the distribution of imagery among characters is important, as is the absence of a common idiom in our play. Before we analyse Bacchae in detail, some comments on the possible 'cultural premises', and the nature and distribution of imagery in authors other than Euripides are in order. Two distinctions are of interest to us: between simile and metaphor, and between those (analogical) types of imagery and metonymy. 4.4. 1 Simile and metaphor versus metonymy We begin with the last-named distinction, which was once broadly defined as an opposition between 'two poles of language', metonymy and metaphor.107 Mindful as we must be of the deep differences between the two 'poles', and, equally, of the inadequacy of analogy to fully account for the effects of metaphor, let us consider metaphor and simile together, in opposition to metonymy, by virtue of their analogical quality. A focus on the ideological reasons why an author might privilege metonymy over other imagery has not been of paramount concern in recent literary scholarship, at least not systematically. If we glance, more specifically, at classical scholarship on archaic poetry and thought, we find various scholars arguing for an analogical tendency within early Greek thought as explanation for its poetic predisposition towards similes or metaphors; and yet, seemingly, the focus has been either on the formal or the philosophical side of the analysis, without any integrated investigation which might provide a 'map of correspon- dences' between style and worldview.108 A well-known contribution on the side of thought is Lloyd's Polarity and Analogy.109 In this work Lloyd defines the characteristic modality of thought in early Greek thinkers and poets in terms of opposition of extremes - polarity - and of analogical linkages. He also considers metaphor and simile as suitable for a worldview which expresses itself in certain recurrent ideas, such as the cosmos conceived as state, the cosmos as living organism, and the cosmos as artefact. The resort to these images implies, for Lloyd, a common notion of continuum between man and cosmos. He discusses, for instance, 'the way in which many particular natural phenomena were conceived as living beings with a will of their own. In Homer, rivers, winds, the sun, Heaven and Earth are among the deities who are called to witness oaths or addressed in prayers as if they had the power to influence events'.110 Lloyd claims that philosophical 107 By Jakobson (1956). His argument (based on 'clinical' evidence), was that the 'métonymie' and the 'metaphorical' are two tendencies of mind available to any speaker, therefore to any poet; in practice 'either of the two gravitational poles may prevail'. What it is of interest for us here is what Jakobson dismisses as the fact that 'in manipulating these two kinds of connection (similarity and contiguity), an individual exhibits his personal style, his verbal predilections and preferences' (77). We want to extend this consideration to an attempt at cultural explanation. Difficult as it is to answer the ultimate questions about 'verbal predilections and preferences', we can perhaps try to delineate some conditions which favour the choice of 'one or the other connection': conditions linked to the text and to its cultural premises. 108 An exception is Seaford's article (2003), on which see below pp. 206-07. 109 Lloyd (1966). 1,0 Lloyd (1966) 202-03. Compare our analysis of these 'appeals to the world' in Chapter I, pp. 13; 45-46, where we linked them to a view of the world as system and to objectification of self and outwardness of character. The importance of imagery for the representation of character is the next step.</page><page sequence="199">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 9 1 analogy should be read against the background of the usage of imagery by poets, arguing, at least incipiently, for a connection between the two aspects.111 In his reflections on 'ambiguity' in Greek literature, conceived essentially as verbal play,112 Stanford considered intentional ambiguity and double meaning as functions of cultural categories. Ruling out esoterism per se as alien to Greek literature, Stanford defined four reasons for verbal ambiguity in Greek poetry: to display dexterity, to exploit association between different values of a term, to deceive (or portray deception), and, in the case of etymology, to satisfy a 'superstitious belief in the mystic meaning of words'.113 Generally speaking, he read instances of verbal ambiguity in terms of their achieved effect, so that, for instance, tragedians use ambiguity to create 'different degrees of information',114 or to engender a metatheatrical play for the benefit of the audience. In arguing this, he opposed Aristotle's dismissal of the ambivalent as a symptom of incom- petence or ignorance.115 The two Homeric poems, in Stanford's judgement, present a relevant contrast as pathetikos ( Iliad) and ethikos (Odyssey), which is then seen to be operative on the level of style. The Iliad offers grandeur, idiomatic straightforwardness, and a penchant for aa&lt;f&gt;f|veia ('clarity'); the Odyssey is marked by subterfuge and deception.116 Some studies of particular authors have also considered the possible links between stylistic and ideological issues. We will only mention a few representative examples. In his book on Pindar and Aeschylus, Finley unites the two poets under the heading of 'symbolic thought'. While acknowledging the differences between the two, Finley unites them for the peculiarities of their style and for their rich imagery, which he describes as belonging to an 'age of feeling', to which an 'age of reason' is (and was) opposed; the latter finds prose as its natural medium. This opposition, for Finley, could also be summarized as an 'age of faith' against an 'age of economy'. 1,7 With perhaps some simplification, Finley also divides Greek literature into two periods, one of symbolic and one of conceptual thought. Thucydides, with his 'enormously abstract diction', is a representative of the second, as he points out in a monograph devoted to the historian.118 Solmsen, also writing on Thucydides, conceives him as a personality of a 'Greek enlightenment'. He analyses elements of the historian's style, and identifies his preference for antitheses and his use of inconcinnitates , synonyms and variado as instrumental to a search for abstraction and objectivity, a desire for distance and scientific generalization.119 In a study of Aeschylus' imagery and imagination, Stanford, again, concentrates on the fact that in Aeschylus the proportion between similes and metaphors is the opposite of m Lloyd (1966) 209. 1,2 Stanford (1939). 1,3 Stanford (1939) 74-75. 114 Stanford (1939) 76. 1,5 Arist.

I propose to show that he achieved this by deliberate caution in the use of metaphors'.126 He adds that 'literary conditions [in Homer's days] in his days would not allow it' since 'at the earlier stage of linguistic systematization, that is, when a language is just beginning to be formalized into a literature, metaphor is more a hindrance than a help... metaphor is the enfant prodige of all who desire to fix and define the meaning of words... by extending meaning metaphor destroys meaning'.127 Old-fashioned and inadequate in its emphasis as it may seem to us now, this quotation is rightly committed to shedding light on our present concern: if not the cause, than at least the conditions on which the choice or use of imagery may depend. In more recent times the necessity to rethink our distinction between the literal and the imagistic in an ancient text has been addressed by various scholars. The matter has been touched on by Edwards in his discussion of simile and narrative in Homer, where 'the interconnection between simile and narrative can be so close that it is impossible to be sure if what is being described is a simile or a metamorphosis'.128 This is relevant to the representation of mental events, where one may easily be tempted to conceive the 'composite mind pattern', for instance, as imagery. In her study of tragic representations of mental events, Padel suggests: 'fifth-century Greeks did not distinguish literal from metaphorical, or not in the way we do'.129 In analysing the representation of speaking organs in Homer and Pindar, Pelliccia faces the same problematic.130 In a study of Homeric terminology for the mind, the issue is also confronted by Clarke, who proposes that the 'literal/metaphorical' distinction needs to be re-thought when we consider the given aspects of Homeric poetry, since 'there is no metaphor, no transference or 120 Stanford (1942). 121 Stanford (1942) 86. 122 Stanford (1942) 102. 123 Stanford (1942) 105. 124 Stanford (1942) 106-10. 125 Stanford (1936) 1 18-43. 126 Stanford (1936) 121. 127 Stanford (1936) 143, 126. 128 Edwards (1987) 108. 129 Padel (1992) 9; see also 9-11. 130 Pelliccia (1995) Chapter 1, especially 27-37.</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 93 extension, no extraneous imagery which we can separate off from what thought and emotion are literally conceived to be'. Lloyd's contribution is more systematic. Focusing mainly on ancient philosophical uses of model and metaphorical extension, Lloyd explores the nature of what he sees as a problematic distinction between metaphorical and literal. It is 'not just an innocent, natural piece of logical analysis, but a weapon forged to defend a territory, repel borders, put down rivals [in establishing the status of philosophy] 'J 31 The distinction (Lloyd argues) has a central requirement, which is what he calls 'how far those categories, the literal and the metaphorical, are explicitly distinguished by the actors themselves'.132 Notwithstanding these discussions, no holistic account of imagery as conditionally related to worldview has been made. I would suggest we would do well to pursue the idea that the seeming continuity of figurative and literal in archaic Greek poetry should be correlated with a notion of continuum between elements of the cosmos. This notion finds expression at a linguistic level, in the way events are presented and in the presentation of man within the world. It is symptomatic of a way of thinking about the relation between man and world which, more widely, includes a continuity or simultaneity in the perception of concrete and abstract, inner and outer, and object and attribute.133 It also means that the world and the objective are foregrounded, and that actors feel entitled to talk about the world in terms of these connections, where their discourse will be understood by all. We can clarify this point by scrutinizing a few instances from the poetry of the period. Examples of the given continuity are commonest in métonymie forms. An example is offered by the common Homeric usage of the so-called 'exocentric' compounds with 'adjectival function' as epithets.134 Typical instances are x^kokvt||iiô6S' ' Axaioi (e.g. at II. VII, 41) and ei)Kvf||ii8as' 'Axaiouç (e.g. at II. VII, 57). The relation (for instance) between xa^KOKi/f||nÔÉÇ and ' AxaLoi is métonymie: to say 'the Achaeans with greaves of bronze' Homer says 'the Achaeans-greaves-of-bronze'. Similarly, we might ponder the non-metonymic juxtaposition poSoSáKTuXoç 'Hcoç (e.g. II. I, 477). What matters for us here is not the expression 'rose fingers' in itself (a cliché);135 rather, is the juxtaposition of 131 Lloyd (1990) 23. See also Lloyd (1987). 132 Lloyd (1990) 20. 133 See Easterling (1973) on the 'simultaneous understanding of supernatural and human causation' in Aeschylus (16): 'by the usage of kindred imagery Aeschylus gives meaning and coherence to events; it is thus that he establishes the causal connection between them' (Lebeck 1971, 77; quoted by Easterling 1973, 18). 134 See Palmer (1980) 258 on compound stems: 'functionally, the compounds fall into two main classes: 1 in which the second element retains its substantival function {e.g. àKpÓTToXiç, 'the upper city'), and 2, those in which the compound is adjectival, e.g. poôoôáKTuXos-, which does not mean "rose-fingers" but " having rose fingers". Such adjectives find their point of attachment outside themselves, and they are known as "exocentric compounds", as opposed to the "endocentric" of type 1'. Instead of straightforwardly identifying 2 as adjectives, since they are formed in the same way as 1, one might ponder the métonymie connection between them and the noun they modify; compare, for instance, the compound àvôpóywos*, which is used as a noun ('a man-woman = a hermaphrodite', Pl. Smp. 189e: áv8póywov...Koiyóv roí» té appÉ^oç Kal Orleos-, 'the herm-aphrodite ... sharing equally in male and female'), and (in later Greek) as an adjective ('suitable for or common to both sexes', AP EX, 783: àvSpoywois' XouTpoîs' 'a bath for both sexes'; Luc. Am., 28: àvôpoyúvous- é porras*, 'Sapphic amours'). 135 Cf.

Consider now the more complex passage at Aeschylus' Agamemnon (79-81), where the chorus present an image of old age: to 0' írrrépyripcov (f&gt;v''á8oç t18t| 80 KaTaKap&lt;1&gt;o|i6VT|Ç Tpinoôaç [lèv ò8ovç aTÉLXÉi ...

All three are presented, through the genitive, as if they were on the same ontological level. This example shows the connection between a view of reality as a continuum and analogically based modes of expression. This view of reality, as we have said, is contiguous to a premise of objective character. My argument, therefore, is that a multiplicity of similes and metaphors is more readily found in a text under certain conditions: (1) the presence in the work of a trust in the systemic nature of the world; (2) the presence in the work of a trust in nature as a reliable and knowable 'source of truth'; (3) the presence in the work of a trust in the possibility of communication in a straightforward manner, if not between characters, then at least between character (or author) and audience. If we turn to ancient literature we find a group of authors who meet our three requirements; they correspond, indeed, to some of the peaks of pre-Platonic literature. This group includes Homer, Heraclitus, Pindar, and Aeschylus, all of whom present a relevant contrast with Euripides' practice. Notwithstanding the evident differences in their uses of imagery, all these authors have in common the preference for some sort of analogical imagery (metaphor or simile), which we do not find in our poet. There must be a reason for this fundamental contrast with Euripides, and this reason (we suggest) is the view of man and world expressed in their works. The three conditions above do not necessarily concern poetry (witness Heraclitus), or ancient poetry only. To take a wholly different point of reference: Melville's Moby Dick , with its strong metaphysical and Gnostic foundation, fulfils our three requirements, in this respect being similar to Homer. One finds in this novel a great number of images, particularly similes, which offer a connection between the life of whalers and a paradigm of the human condition. Conversely, a book like Musil' s The Man Without Qualities , located at the other end of the spectrum as far as the belief in a systemic world is concerned, is marked by a deconstructed, nihilist and relativist Weltanschauung ; and in respect of its idiom, the book is not characterized by metaphor, but by irony and word-</page><page sequence="203">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 195 play.136 In sum, it is not my intention to draw too sharp a line between ancient and modern poetry, as if the rationale of imagery in Greek literature had nothing to do with those for imagery in modern literature. This is certainly not the case; and a link between a 'strong' view of the world as some sort of system and the use of analogical imagery, likewise, might be claimed there too. However, it is arguably the case that in modern poetry metaphor is related to the first two conditions, but not to the third - 'the presence in the work of a trust in the possibility of communication in a straightforward manner, if not between characters, then at least between character (or author) and audience'. The communicative and public quality of the poetic word is as evident in pre-Hellenistic Greek as a subjective, introverted quality is characteristic of modern Western poetry, influenced as it is by the Cartesian opposition between objectivity and mind. This distinction is of the greatest importance, if we are to commit ourselves to a reading of style as partially motivated by or related to features of worldview. For Greek literature in particular, a central presupposition is of words as ontological realities. Only on this basis, for instance, can we fully understand an untranslatable proposition like Pindar's TeXeuTa0€v 8è Xóycov Kopušai I èv àXaQeía TTeToîaai (Ol. VII 68-69). 137 Preoccupation with the functions and effects of verbal discourse in tragedy is another facet, or development, of this assumed concreteness of the word in Greek culture.138 This concreteness was masterfully illuminated by Heidegger in his reflections on Parmenides, notwithstanding the notorious radicalism of his views, his problematic etymological arguments, and the difficulties of his overall philosophy of Being.139 The way the 'word' (Xóyoç/pOÔoç) is experienced by the Greeks before Plato (Heidegger maintains) provides the first access to 'unconcealment of being', a-Xf|0£ia. Accordingly, for the Greek poets, language is far from a representational means, being connected rather with the coming-out of being itself. This suggestive interpretation of the nature of Greek poetry offers us a precious key to understanding the uniqueness of metaphor and simile in the given pre-Platonic Greek authors and only there. After the watershed represented by Plato - the birth of systematic Western metaphysics - metaphor started being what it is for us, a means of expression, seen as such by the author.140 Bacchae is located just at this 136 The same correspondence was briefly addressed by Barthes in a comment on why nowadays the 'analogical arts' (like cinema and photography) are discredited. 'Why? Because analogy implies an effect of nature: it constitutes the 'natural' as source of truth1 (Barthes 1975, 48). 137 A literal translation could be 'the essential points of these words fell in with truth and were fulfilled'. C/., among recent discussions of tragic discourse, Halliwell (1998) 141 : 'we can and should read the rhetoric of tragedy in ways which go beneath ... to the latent patterns, and the lurking anxieties, of a cultural mentality which sustained and mistrusted rhetoric in equal measure'; Goldhill (1997b) 145: 'the way in which "language is a sort of instructive way to organize reality" (PI. Cratylus 388b 13) is a shared fixation of the intellectual activity of the classical city... democracy prided itself on putting matters es meson , 'into the public domain to be contested'. Tragedy puts language itself es meson1. 139 Heidegger (1992). 140 Cf. Lloyd (1966) 302 on imagery in early Greek literature as informed by a vitalistic sense of analogy, as contrasted with Plato's more 'aware' use of images: 'Plato's attitude to the use of images in cosmology is marked out from that of his predecessors in this, that he was fully aware (as they probably were not) of the distinction between a (mere) image and a demonstrative account'.</page><page sequence="204">196 HIDDEN PATHS turning point, and the disruption between the language of the play and the language of characters shows it. 4.4.2 Metaphor versus simile Within the sphere of 'analogical imagery', we must now distinguish simile from meta- phor. The relevant facts may be summarized thus: in Homer we have a high usage of similes, especially long similes, and a very low usage of metaphors; in Aeschylus (and to a lesser extent in Sophocles) we have a striking presence of metaphors, and few similes (especially long ones); in Euripides neither metaphor nor simile is frequent. Simile (let us propose) is more rigid than metaphor and less suited to the abstract or the general, while metaphor is more flexible in being potentially applicable to descriptive or narrative contexts as much as to supernatural, sapiential or emotive ones. Simile (especially short simile) tends to rely on an analogy present in the world in the sense of an objective permanence of qualities in that world, operating a reduction from the general to the particular. The analogy offered or relied on by metaphor, conversely, tends to imply a subjective, first-person insight. It covers all the possibilities of simile, but it is special in that it also allows the expression of personal feelings, or the exploration of super-human facts such as fate, the extension from the particular to the general principle. Representatively, contrast the simile at Th. 393, where Tydeus shouts (ßoa, at 392-93) ÏTTTTOS' xa^Ll;ûv coç KaTa&lt;j0paii&gt;GüV |i6V6i, I öotl? ßofjv adXmyyoç ÓppaiV£l kXÚGúV ('like a horse that, hearing the brazen horn-blast, snorts in rage at his bridle, rears and stamps'), with the metaphor at Ag. 659: ôpûpev àvôow TTéXayoç Alyaîov veKpoîs' 'we saw the Aegean main blooming with the corpses of Achaean men'. The first, with its descriptive tone, reports an objective fact, the behaviour of the warrior; no explicit influence of the messenger's viewpoint is communicated. The second, also uttered by a messenger, puts emphasis on his own participatory viewpoint in the aftermath of the violent storm: the oxymoronic effect between avQovv, 'to bloom', and v£Kpots' 'corpses', for instance, amplifies the contradiction between two subjective feelings: relief at having survived, at the end of the storm, and grief at the loss of many human lives. There is, in effect, a different articulation of subjective and objective within the two classes of analogical imagery (metaphor and simile respectively). This helps us understand the extreme case of Bacchae , where, despite their overall subjectivization, the characters' own aware, subjective viewpoint is impeded, and rather than metaphor and simile we have imagery constantly digressing into realized facts, as we shall see. 4.5 Some aspects of imagery in the three tragedians The next step is to consider some examples from the three tragedians. The aim thereby is to make better sense of the general absence of striking metaphors or similes in Euripides (and in Bacchae in particular) and to show the connection between this low level of usage and a change in the view of man and in the representation of character. In Aeschylus, apart from the higher tally of metaphors, we find certain characteristics in the use of imagery which are exactly what we do not find in Bacchae. They can be summarized thus:</page><page sequence="205">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 1 97 1) General awareness of tropes or other imagery on the part of characters using them, or implied for the audience. Note in particular the Aeschylean habit, described by Stanford, of offering an 'explanation' for metaphorical obscurity, by means of variation, parataxis, explicative genitives or participles.141 2) A repeated image used by several characters, characterizing a play or trilogy. This 'image-sustaining' function is also analysed by Stanford as working towards a general unity of theme, whereas in Euripides imagery is more often linked to characters and thus personalized.142 3) Reference to a continuity of worldview and to shared models of belief. Points 1 and 2 have a very important bearing on our issues of character representation in isolation from or integration with the context (our concern in Chapter III); point 3 connects the use of imagery to the belief in the system of the world as shaping a character's view of him or herself (our concern in Chapter II). Points 1 and 2 need further discussion now; point 3 will be seen to be instantiated by various of the examples considered. Regarding point 1: in Agamemnon , for instance, characters are often shown to be aware of the images they are using as rhetorical entities. With similes, most explicitly, apologetic elements such as (bç, 8ikt|v' tpóttov ('as', 'like', 'such as'),143 rotoLôe ... uoļiOL ('in the way that...'),144 or the expressions oxjTTep řj napoLpía ('as the story tells...'),145 or av,..npoaew€TTOLS ('you would say that...'),146 or raXauJ&gt;&lt;rro ç...Àóyoç ('there is an ancient story, that...'),147 testify to the character's awareness of the figurative expressions they are using, which are understood by the other characters and meant to be understood by them. They are also understood by the audience, and correspondingly by the modern reader. Some instances clearly problematize (almost metaliterarily), the nature of description, as at Ag. 242, TTpéTTOixrá 0 ' coç ev ypa^atç ('as in a picture', referring to Iphigenia's image evoked by the chorus in their account of the curse of the Atreides). Likewise with Aegisthus' berating of the chorus, at 1629-32: 'Op&lt;J&gt;€i 8è yXûacrav ii'v èvavTiav €x^tS"l ó [lèv yàp fjye ttqlvt ' olttò ^öoyyfjs* X°W I 8 'è^opívaç ur|TrioLç úXáyiiaaiv I fifrļ, 'your tongue is the opposite of Orpheus': he would lead everything after him through its delight in his voice, but your provocation with your silly yelping will have you led away'. One cannot indeed consider the presence of apology per 141 Stanford (1942) 101. 142 Stanford (1942) 96. See also Headlam (1902) 438 on 'figurative conceptions [in Aeschylus] running through a whole play', and on the poet's 'peculiar habit... to sustain his figures' (436). Schenker (1999, 641) describes these 'patterns of imagery' as a 'common denominator underlying the speech of characters with widely different roles in the play', and as determining a 'character overlap', aimed at '[conveying] larger meanings than any individual could alone' (645). This phenomenon, although present in Euripides as well, is certainly more important in Aeschylus. 143 E.g. at Ag. 390. 144 ¿£.312. 145 Ag. 264. 146 Ag. 323. 147 Ag. 750-51.</page><page sequence="206">198 HIDDEN PATHS se as testifying to live metaphor;148 apology, however, certainly testifies to the presence of a shared idiom among characters. We have only given examples from one play; however, such examples show an aspect of literary representation which works towards characterization, and an aspect which, as we have seen, is lacking in Bacchae : a character's self-awareness.149 Aeschylean char- acters who make a rhetorical, finalized use of motifs and metaphors offer a straight- forward, one-sided communication among themselves and also betray a view of literature as of a less illusory fictional ity than we are used to with modern literary practice - or to some extent, as we have seen, than we are used to with the literary practice of Euripides.150 Such a common idiom, rich in shared imagery, is not part of Bacchae' s style, where, instead, one can note the emergence of a 'naturalistic expectation' about a character's expressions. Consider the herdsman at 717, introducing into his narrative the indirect speech of a third character: he defines him in advance as tiç TrXávr|Ç kot ' doTu Kai Tpißojy Xóycüv, 'one who wandered in the town and was a slick speaker', as if to 'apologize' for the ensuing fluent idiom, which would not be naturalistically plausible if applied to himself. Likewise, consider Hecuba's cue in Euripides' Troades 686-87: the queen apologizes for using a conventional nautical simile to express her turmoil, as she, being a woman, would not be supposed to have a direct experience of ships and sailing: aÙTT] piv outtcl) vaòç eiaeßqv GKácfroç, ļ ypa&lt;(&gt;fļ 8 ' iöoöaa Kai kXúouct èmcjTapai, 'I have not yet set foot on a ship myself, but I know of them from pictures and from what I have heard...'. We do not see the Aeschylean Clytemnestra 'apologize' for any of the expressions she uses as inappropriate in her mouth: they are expected to be understood by all the other characters, and not felt to be misplaced against some sort of 'realist' canon by the audience. Our second point concerns the presence of the same image in the mouth of a multiplicity of characters, whereby one is led to perceive a common imagery shaping the play, and constituting a world of meanings and values within which several or all char- acters operate. There is a very important distinction to be made here. In Bacchae too we have shaping motifs throughout the play, and most of our readings in Chapters II and III are based on the analysis of these motifs. But in Bacchae constituent instances of these motifs are not consciously alluded to by the characters through their choice of imagery. They are acted out by them, they are ultimately constituted by them: but through lack of awareness, not in a continuous allusion through discourse as with Aeschylean characters.151 In Aeschylus, thanks to this continuous allusion, the author's language and the characters' language are often effectively the same. In this way, for instance, the chorus use a lion-metaphor at Ag. 140-45, in the prophetic image of the lion-cubs (ôpóaoiç àé-nrois- paXepajv Xéóvtoüv, 141), and at 717-36, referring to Paris as 'lion's offspring', 148 Silk (1974) 52. 149 See Chapter II. 1, pp. 61; 65; 84-85; and II.2.2, pp. 93-98 on Pentheus' lack of awareness of his own madness and sickness respectively. 150 See above, Chapter IV.3, 186-89. 1S| See e.g. Chapter II.3, pp. 100-04 on the tying-binding key- words.</page><page sequence="207">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 199 XéovTO? l'viv (717-18), who was received into Troy with all honours and, once grown up, doomed to bring death and destruction to the city; at 827 Agamemnon calls the avenging action of the Greek army in Troy (opricrTriç Xécov, 'ravening lion', whereas at 1258-59 Cassandra calls Clytemnestra 'a two-footed lioness' (Ôittouç Xéaiva) sleeping with the wolf 'in the absence of the noble lion', Xêovroç evyevovç ctTTOixjia, and at 1224 she calls Aegisthus 'a cowardly lion', Xcovr'avaXiav.152 Contrast the animals in Bacchae. In Agamemnon we do not have 'staged' or evoked animals - whereas they are abundant in Bacchae}57, The lion is a recurrent image in the Agamemnon , and will return in Choephori (938) and Eumênides (193-94), but it is recurrent within the characters' idiom and only there. This has important consequences for the depiction of these characters, which could be, perhaps prosaically, summarized thus: they all know what a lion is; they all connect the idea of a lion to certain characteristics (fierceness, cruelty, greed, violence); they all believe that the other characters to whom they speak (and this is consequentially true for an audience) will understand and interconnect the whole network of allusions and precedents that the lion represents: the Trojan war, the violent curse of the family, the slaughter of Iphigenia. Another corollary of this presence of a shared language is the fact that there is no characterful specialization of idiom in Aeschylus. Yes, as expected, the chorus' lyrics are especially rich in metaphorical usage, which arguably suits the position of authority institutionally occupied by them, as well as their participation in the troubles of city and royal family. And yet other characters approach this richness: Cassandra, the watchman, and especially Clytemnestra. A glance at the queen's lines at 281-316 and 320-50 shows an extensive usage of metaphors which would seem misplaced to us, if we had an expectation of naturalistic correspondence between the idiom of a character and his or her expected emotional participation at that moment. Within this expectation, metaphors must have a confirming, emphatic function proportional to their originality and expressive strength: as a consequence, from these lines in the queen's speech one would gain an impression of the character's concern and involvement in the events very different from what these really are, as later revealed by the development of the story. The queen's lines at 281-316 are very dense in imagery.154 In this passage she minutely describes the 'courier of fire' which has broadcast the victory over Troy; she 152 This aspect was analysed by Knox, who reads the lion imagery in the Oresteia as a 'knot of suggestions which evoke simultaneously all the principal characters [of the trilogy]' (Knox 1952, 18). See also Heath (1999) who analyses the articulation of animal imagery in the Oresteia in connection with 'justice' and 'speech' as qualifiers of humanity, especially 26 with n. 32 where he assesses the phenomenon of 'fusion' or 'intrusion' ('the tendency in similes for elements of one part of the comparison to slip into the other'). 153 See Chapter III.2, pp. 130-31 . 154 E.g. at 286-87 ttóvtou ojoté vojtíctoiI loxùs* tknutou XapTTdSos* ('to cross the ocean's back, the journeying flare...'), referring to the courier of fire, and ojç tis* fjXLos* ('like a sun') at 288; 8ÍKqv | (jjaiôpâç oeXTii/qç ('like the shining moon') at 297-98; qyeípcv dXXqu ék8oxtiu ttopttoD Tupos* ('it woke a further relay in sending on the fire') at 299; &lt;'&gt;áoç tč&gt;8 ' oùtc diraTTTTou ' I Saíou Trupós* ('the light which is a true grandchild of the fire on Ida') at 311, and XapTTa8Ti&lt;J&gt;ópojv uópoi ('like beacon-bearers') at 312. At 315-16 the queen calls the sequence of fires a 'signal' (oupßoXou) that her husband is sending her: the metaphors that she uses put emphasis on her perception of the 'signal' just as if she were a genuinely anxious wife, waiting for news of her husband.</page><page sequence="208">200 HIDDEN PATHS lingers over general issues, such as the destruction of the Trojan people, slaughtered or reduced to slaves (320-49), and the religious importance, for the victors, of not being arrogant or over-violent towards the defeated (338-42). 155 One may argue that the queen's outburst of enthusiasm for Troy's fall, and her reflections on the behaviour of the victors are devices aimed merely at deceiving the chorus about her real intention;156 however, the elaboration of the passage would hardly be justified, even so.157 Her mode of expression, then, is simply part of an idiom rich in metaphors shared by all the characters in the play, to various degrees. This idiom puts emphasis on certain themes - Troy's fall, the behaviour of the victors, Atreus' household, and so on - but not in relation to the single subject-character's feelings or concerns. The verbal emphasis is attached to themes, not to characters. In such passages, naturalistic expectations of complete coherence must be set aside, otherwise we risk either judging the play incoherent, or charging it with subtle psychological strategies which are not there. A similar procedure to Aeschylus' is apparent in some of Sophocles' plays, albeit here imagery is generally less striking. In Sophocles' Antigone , as Goheen's celebrated reading has shown,158 certain images are associated with particular characters (control and money, with Creon; marriage to death, with Antigone), but most recurrent images are scattered throughout the play, and are used by various characters with different tones - as, for example, money is a negative concept for Creon (310, 322, 326), but a metaphor for 'value' in a positive sense for Haimon (684, 699) and positive again for Tiresias (1032), without any Euripidean irony or relativization of meaning. As in Aeschylus, little of the imagery is personally linked to characters: the same image is used by different people in different applications,159 and this procedure testifies that all the characters involved share a certain model (e.g. of money), and that they understand each other. A common idiom is 155 In saying that, from a naturalistic point of view, all this metaphorical emphasis does not suit Clytemnestra's real concern - vengeance on her husband - 1 am not dismissing the ambiguity and allusions present in the speech (for example, at 346, an allusion to Iphigenia's death) or the fact that her eagerness for her husband's return can be genuine inasmuch as it means the possibility of taking revenge on him, or the fact that her reflections on the behaviour of winners, which has to measure itself against the religious duty of respect towards the gods, are linked to her overall condemnation of Agamemnon's priorities which once culminated in Iphigenia's slaughter. Her motivation for wishing to see Agamemnon is certainly different to that of the chorus; it is presented, in any event, as a sincere wife's affection. Moreover, the other points in her speech (the thought of the defeated Trojans and the ethical issues about moderation in good luck, at 338-42) are in a naturalistic perspective no doubt misplaced. 156 Cf. her admission at 1372-73: ttoXXûi; Trápoi0€v Kai pito? eipr||iéiw TàvavTÍ ' €ÍTi€Ív oùk ¿muaxui^qaopai ' After saying much before that suited the moment, I shall not feel shame to say the opposite. 157 Compare the subsequent lack of shame or respect she eventually shows towards the chorus, as at 1421-25 and 1 672. In other instances her malice is apparent instead, as at Ag. 606-08; the chorus in fact feels the ambiguity, at 6 1 5-16. The emphasis in our scene, therefore, is not on the queen's deceitfulness. 158 Goheen ( 1 95 1 ). 159 Again, military images are used by Creon, Antigone, Ismene, Haemon, the chorus, and Tiresias, now as negative images of tyranny and imposition, now as images of reasonable defence against an unjust attack.</page><page sequence="209">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 20 1 thus created, which determines a common ground of communication and intelligibility between the different characters. Sophocles' language is not distinguished by extraordinary connections as that of Aeschylus is; and many of the instances analysed by Goheen are part of the Greek language by his time (and so not imagery in the strict sense). They are, in effect, rhetorical instruments primarily available to the characters - and, arguably, to the audience - to express their feelings and give strength to their reasons. For instance, one might ponder the difference between saying about someone 'you are flying [in your mind]', as Euripides' Cadmus does to Pentheus, and saying 'she (Antigone) shrieks with the sharp voice of a sorrowful bird'. The different 'grammars' of these metaphors imply different degrees of communication.160 In the Sophocles, the distance between the tenor and the vehicle of the comparison is kept in focus; the bird-image is a linguistic mechanism used consciously by the guard to describe more effectively the girl's appearance. Imagery in a theatrical text is, fundamentally, a vehicle for communication between speakers. In Bacchae , this communication is disrupted,161 and recurrent images (linked to motifs or groups of keywords, as with &lt;ro&lt;f&gt;ia, 'wisdom', or the tying/freeing 'imagery') are a locus of problematization and ultimately of misunderstanding instead. 4.6 Some aspects of imagery in Euripides' Bacchae We can now restate various of our earlier findings. Euripides has often been stigmatized as poor in original imagery. The descriptive approach to this stylistic issue has been partly superseded by Barlow,162 who redeems Euripides from accusations of a general lack of poetic quality by accounting for what she calls the poet's different 'pictorial' feel in descriptions and his usage of what she calls 'personalized imagery'.163 In her book on the poet's style, Barlow draws a distinction between the imagery associated with metaphors and similes (as in Aeschylus) and the 'sensuous, pictorial imagery' of Euripides which, albeit different, is no less effective and imaginative. Here, however, we can change perspective and link imagery to the representation of characters in the given play. This different perspective also helps to frame Euripides' avoidance of metaphors, as opposed to Aeschylus' abundant usage of them, within a broader discourse on the view of man and self presented in the two playwrights' work. While metaphor may be said to invite the audience to look for a 'subjective viewpoint', and is ultimately a reminder of the fictional nature of drama, the reverse is apparent in Bacchae. Here the first-person viewpoint is entrusted to instances of unawareness, rather than to straightforward first-person utterances. In practice, this translates into the following facts: use of personalized images 160 Different degrees of explicitness, as defined by Brooke-Rose (1958) 206, arising from the difference between verb-metaphor (our example from Bacchae : vvv...tt€tt' , 332) and noun-metaphor (our Antigone example: fļ Traiç ópâTat KàvaKWKÚei m iepūs* I öpviOos* ò£w (frôôyyov, 423-24). 161 Recent readings of the play have underlined this aspect: see Segal (1982; 1985; 1986, 105-06 and extensively 1997a); Goldhill (1988). 162 Barlow (1971), especially 1-4. 163 Which is not 'imagery' proper: the term is largely used by her to indicate descriptive passages or figurative digressions.</page><page sequence="210">202 HIDDEN PATHS (images linked to a single character in particular);164 enactment of images (whereby the characters live or interpret literally what for the audience, or for other characters, have a deeper symbolic meaning)165 and the blurring of the division between image and actuality. In addition, as far as other elements of diction and figures of speech are concerned, we note in our play a preference for irony, word-play and verbal effects such as oxymoron, polyptoton and repetition, which deserve scrutiny as unconscious effects on the part of the dramatic characters. All these elements of personalized images and word-play are arranged in such a way as to seem to be a natural complement of the events themselves, rather than a consciously employed stylistic device. We have touched on these issues in previous chapters; in fact, the analysis by groups of key- words and motifs conducted in Chapter II and III is based on the assumption that verbal repetition and images determined beyond the characters' gaze are specific to our play: a similar analysis, I argue, would not have been as fruitful if applied to, say, an Aeschylean play or even another Euripidean play like Medea ; we will now try and offer an overall interpretation of these facts. 4.6.1 Personalized images In our analysis of motifs, in Chapters II and III, we discussed the keywords which are applied to one character in particular (e.g. 0ip, 'beast', to Pentheus). In Bacchae this involves a characteristic pattern of images used as symbols, which are contiguous and juxtaposed to events, almost an evasion from them, rather than a comment on them as they are in Aeschylus. These images contribute to characterization in being specific to a single character. Barlow comes the closest to recognizing the characterful usage of imagery in Euripides:166 [Ijmagery in monody has an important dramatic function [which is] to reflect the individual obsessions or preoccupations of the singer of the monody;... the Euripidean monody does represent important advances in basic concepts of characters and in the causation of human tragedy, and imagery plays an important part in making articulate such insights.167 and again: [One of the functions] of language descriptive of personal appearance in rhesis and dialogue affects major characters, and the establishment of 'permanent' (for the purposes of the play) attitudes of characters in them. Beyond the resources of costume and mask, such language may be a clue to the degree of emotional damage a character is suffering, or on the contrary may stress the gap there can be between 164 Cf. Collard (1981) 27: 'single images, or simile and metaphor, can illuminate character and emotion, helping to fix tone and mood'. 165 This aspect has been noted by Barlow (1971) 125. 166 See Barlow (1971) 81. 167 Barlow (1971) 45.</page><page sequence="211">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 203 external show and inward reality, or again may tell the audience certain otherwise unacknowledged traits about the person to whom the description is attributed.168 Here are some examples taken from our analysis in Chapter III.169 Images of fawns or foals are frequent, and always associated with the women. Bird images are also linked to the women. Chthonic elements are linked to both Pentheus and Dionysus, paradoxically enough, in that the god has come to assert his Olympian status, and Pentheus styles himself a devotee of the Olympian gods; the lion appears as the prey and figura of Pentheus; the chthonic monster or dragon is used to refer to him; the bull is an image for the god and a hallucination of the king at the same time. The chthonic references to the king are an especially good example of a personalized and allusive procedure. At 538-39 the king is accused of secretly belonging to a x^oviov yévoç, a 'chthonic race' (538-39), and is likened to a c|&gt;óviov...yiyavT ' , a 'slaughterous giant' (544). At 987-91, the chorus denounce him in relevant terms: 'Who then gave him birth? For he was not born from the blood of a woman, but from some lioness, or else he is descended from Libyan Gorgons'. There is here an (ironic) anticipation of the sub- sequent delusion of Agave, his real mother, who will actually think she has killed a lion, while she has in fact killed her son. At 1155, the chorus finally celebrate his death as 'the descendant of the snake', toí) 8pdKovTos'..£Ky£V£Ta.170 These images reveal to the audience aspects of the king's character which could only be known to an omniscient participant or spectator: his violence, aggressiveness, his self-styled Olympian religiosity which in fact conceals impiety, his relation to the chthonic domain through his father's heritage. Moreover, they serve to connect the overall chthonic allusions with the lion - his final impersonation as victim - and with the snake, itself a Dionysiac and chthonic element. This limited sample shows a major difference from the usage of imagery in, say, Aeschylus, where an image like the lion in Oresteia is connected to several characters on the basis of a specifiable ground {e.g. 'fierceness'). In Bacchae the image is manipulated by the author in a manner not sensed by the characters; moreover, we have a development of an image parallel to the development of a character. For instance, the bird-image maps all the aspects of the women's behaviour: peaceful, aggressive, military, finally helpless; similarly, the line which separates Pentheus the king from Pentheus the would-be Bacchant is dangerously blurred by the images of fluttering repeatedly connected with him;171 finally, the foal and fawn images are connected to the women as connotative of peace and nature (164-66), but also of fear, hunting and victimization (866-76). It is true that in Antigone , for instance, the motif of marriage to death is personally attached to the heroine and not applied to other characters in the same way. At the same time, however, the uses of this motif in Sophocles' play connect the heroine with other exemplars, in particular Niobe and Danae. The motif is consciously used by several 168 Barlow (1971) 81. 169 See Chapter III, pp. 128-32. 170 See also 996, 1016. 171 See Chapter II p. 64 with n. 14.</page><page sequence="212">204 HIDDEN PATHS characters and by Antigone herself,172 self-reflexively, and finally integrates her within the doomed conjugal history of her incestuous family; it is, in effect, a means of connecting a character with shared beliefs and with the events taking place. 4.6.2 Imagery and the elusive Characteristically, then, the imagery in Bacchae takes shape behind the person. In a particular sense, it is enacted, not verbal - even though, of course, its base is necessarily verbal. The characters act it out. They determine it, but they do not realize it: only the audience can notice it. Thus it is with the entrance of Cadmus and Tiresias at the beginning of the play, and their relationship with the two graceful foals which the chorus have just described (164-66 and 170 ff.);173 with Pentheus on the tree, like a bird, or like a king on a horse (1070- 74); 174 with Pentheus dressed up, like a woman, a corpse, an initiate, a hunted hunter. In all these instances, visual aspects of the play interact with verbal, in such a way as to put into question the facts of the situation. What is really happening? What is the difference between hallucination and divine appearance? This elusiveness, important in Euripides in general,175 is certainly crucial for Bacchae}16 In Bacchae , images are not a device used by characters to express themselves within conventional expressive means. Rather, the imagery seems to be performed by them and even to use them. The Maenads ravaging the houses do not only resemble birds on the grounds of an abstract analogy; they behave like birds, moving in an organized flock. The simile introduced by &lt;hç ('like', 'as') is only the tip of the iceberg; we see the resemblance of their behaviour to that of a bird-army through a net of Homeric reminiscences;177 through the allusion to the ritual idea of the initiate as 'flying',178 and ultimately through a whole set of events in the play which belong to this sphere. Agave is a hunter; a pollution and epidemic is not explicitly mentioned, but we know it is taking place.179 All in all, imagery in Bacchae is less of a stylistic or rhetorical issue than a staged event. We may recall our discussion of other verbal elements, like the tying-freeing keywords. Our analysis revealed that, unlike in Aeschylus or Sophocles, in Bacchae these words are used only literally; yet a kind of figurai tying is ever-present in the play, more 172 At 654 by Creon, at 804 by the chorus, at 810-11, 833, 867, 876-77, 891, 917 by Antigone, at 1224-25 and 1 240 by the messenger. 173 On the comic and parodie effect of this entrance, see Seidensticker (1978) 310-16. 174 See Chapter ĪII.2, pp. 137-38 n. 137. 175 What Buxton (1988) calls 'tragic bafflement'. 176 This is true even with Oranje's reservations (Oranje 1984, 171), that 'it seems unlikely that Euripides in the Bacchae deliberately created the possibility that his audience should reach differing ideas about the action, though this could in theory have been the poet's intention at a conceptual level'. 177 The flight as image of hoplitic columns set out for battle is present in II.

We have here a use of symbolic language, which implies awareness and control on the part of the poet, but unawareness on the part of the characters made symbols. 4.6.3 Blurring the distinction between image and actuality In the play the divide between figurai and actual is severely blurred.182 The blurring is mostly evident with the group of key-words from the animal domain, as we have seen in Chapter III. This kind of 'shading' is not wholly new in Greek literature, and it 'works particularly well in drama because everything in a play is in a sense metaphorical, in that it presents past and/or fictitious events as ¿/they were happening here and now before the audiences' eyes', as Easterling has argued in her reading of 'plain words in Sophocles',183 with reference, for instance, to Oedipus' 'staged' journey to Colonus and his journey to death. However, such Sophoclean instances are modest indeed by comparison with those in our play. In Bacchae such liminality or interplay has a much greater scope, and tends to work in reverse. Rather than a 'literal' instance being charged with further symbolic meanings, we observe the coming together of literal and symbolic elements onto the same level. We may recall one usage in particular to suggest the ramifications of this blurring, the bull (Tdûpoç) as attribute of Dionysus. At 100 Dionysus is characterized as TaupÓKčpoiv ('bull-horned') by the chorus; at 618 a bull appears in lieu of the stranger as victim of the king's frenzy in the stable (TaOpov); in the Maenads' sparagmos of the cattle, we see the killing of TdOpoi ... ußpidTdi, 'bulls ... putting anger into their horns' (743); at 1017 the chorus invokes the god in this form (&lt;f&gt;ávr|0i Tdüpos' 'appear as a bull!'); Dionysus is a bull in Pentheus' perception (Taupos'..8oiceLÇ and TÉTaúpcúcrai, 920 and 922, 'you appear to be a bull' and 'you are changed into a bull') and as Pentheus' guide in the chorus' description (raupov TrpoTļyT|Tfipd, at 1159, 'a bull as leader'). Such usage influences the representation of characters in the play on various levels. The most superficial reading links the bull to Dionysus (via theological or mythological association). Then, there is the similarity or opposition of Dionysus and the king, so that the Tdöpoi...ußpicrTdL killed by the women at 743 are a figura of Pentheus, while the bull he tries to imprison at 618 is a substitute for the god. Then again, we have the theme of doubling and disguise: at 100 and 1017, the god is invoked as able to take taurine form at will, and at 920-22 Pentheus actually sees him transformed. Of these numerous allusions 180 See Chapter II.3, pp. 100-06. 181 For Pentheus* inability to grasp the 'more than literal* see p. 1 1 1 n. 44. 182 Segal (1985) 162 notes the modest incidence of metaphor and simile in the play, and sees it as among the 'indications of epistemological fluidity' that (on his argument) point to a metatheatrical reading of the play. More to the point, Barlow (1971) 105 notes: 'When Agave refers to Pentheus in the tree as a 'climbing beast', rov cipßdTTiv I Ofjp ' (1 107-08), it is one of those instances where metaphor and realistic portrayal of delusion meet. Agave's language is metaphorical to all but herself. Cf. Foley (1985) 243: 'unlike Dionysus (and the audience) [Pentheus] has no sense of metaphor'. 183 Easterling (1999) 98.</page><page sequence="214">206 HIDDEN PATHS to the bull, some instances are imagery in the ordinary sense (1159), some are real facts reported literally (743), some are, seemingly, hallucinations (920). Perhaps the most telling instance of this blend of figure and actuality is Agave's conviction that she is carrying the head of a slaughtered lion, since it engenders not only a play between literal and image, but even between image and literal hallucination, so to speak. The lion, as we have seen, is frequently mentioned as figure of Pentheus or symbol of fierceness and violence; a tamed version of this figure, reversed in its helplessness (a lion cub, slaughtered, and held like a baby in a mother's arms) is present in Agave's derangement, and connected by the audience to the previous imagery: its significance stands out against the text, not within the characters' awareness. One large consequence of this is to configure Pentheus as isolated and mad, to draw a deep connection between him and the god, and to compromise the monology of the play. These consequences are not present in the Sophoclean example cited by Easterling: there we have a dramatic event - Oedipus' arrival in Colonus - which symbolizes something else at the same time. The reality of what is happening onstage, as opposed to the symbolic journey, is straightforward. In the case of the bull, or the lion, in Bacchae the repetition of the symbol at different levels of fictionality compromises our understanding of what is happening. 4.7 Other aspects of the style of Bacchae Various aspects of the play's style are significative of the relationship between characters: polyptoton and oxymoron to underline opposition;184 false or 'folk' etymology,185 and finally metalingual 'discourse on words' and irony to underline disrupted communication. The first two are interconnected with the third, and mutually explicative. In a very suggestive article, Seaford analysed the presence, in Presocratic, tragic and mystery texts, of the stylistic device of Satzparallelismus. 186 Satzparallelismus comprises antithesis, oxymoron, certain instances of polyptoton, plus instances where 'two sentences are distinct in content , but resemble each other in form '. Seaford reads these stylistic aspects as referable to a link between 'ritual, tragic action and cosmology',187 ultimately confirming a reading of tragedy as affected by its 'genesis' in 'mystery cult and hero cult', by presenting an opposition which leads to a final composition of order.188 His argument is centred on the example of Oresteia but includes examples from Bacchae (by virtue, for Seaford, of its projection 'of death in mystic ritual').189 No other Euripidean play is mentioned. 184 Gould (1987b) 36 noted how 'examples of oxymoron in our play. ..bring home. ..the juxtaposition of incongruous perceptions'. m The debatable argument that the 'etymological-homonymic' procedure is to be traced back to Hecataeus (Musso 1968) does not undermine the significance of Euripides' insistence on this element in our play. On etymology in Euripides, see van Looy (1973). 186 Seaford (2003). 187 Seaford (2003) 141. 188 Seaford (2003) 147. 189 Seaford (2003) 146.</page><page sequence="215">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 207 It is interesting to recall here that it is actually the Aristophanic Aeschylus who stigmatizes a similar figure of speech as typically Euripidean in Frogs 1082, accusing the younger tragedian of staging women 'who say that to be alive is not to be alive', (f&gt;aaKOÚaaç où Cw T° (echoed by Dionysus at 1477, 'who knows if to be alive is actually to be dead?', Tiç 8' oibev £i to £fju piv ècm KaTÖavelv;). 190 In these two examples, one may note the parody of the solemn oxymoron of mystery verse on the poles of life and death (for instance, vOv cQaveç Kai vOv èyévou, 'now you died and now you were born...'). 191 We are surely bound to differentiate between the usage in Aeschylus and the usage in Euripides,192 especially in Bacchae (despite Seaford's reading of the role of the mysteries in it).193 Conversely, Satzparallelismus in Aeschylus implies a final 'unity of opposites', and in Aeschylus, indeed, 'it is a mistake to see the ambivalences as (consciously or even unconsciously) devised to evoke [a] sense [of a tension not fully resolved]'.194 Any monolithic view of tragedy, whereby Bacchae is also affected by the same tendency towards a final 'unity', is surely untenable, even if one does not wish to 'privilege disorder' in interpreting the play.195 As with the usage of metaphor, in Bacchae these opposional devices have a cumulative effect of relativizing instead of clarifying, and demolishing instead of confirming reference. Let us consider our text more closely. Polyptoton is abundant in Bacchae , both as juxtaposition of different forms of the same verb or noun, and as etymological play between different forms.196 In some cases the polyptoton has the plain effect of emphasizing a concept (as at 178-79, yipuv...(To&lt;f&gt;fiv ao&lt;f&gt;ou nap ' àvSpóç, 'a wise voice of a wise man': the wisdom of Tiresias is great in Cadmus' eyes). In other cases, the procedure helps to underline the connection or similarity between two people (as at 186, yépœv yépovTi, 'one old man to another', referring to the two old men). Such uses are not in themselves striking, but serve to establish an operative mode of verbal repetition. The most interesting use is the one which lays stress on the ambiguity of a term or situation, or on the passive and active sides of the same action. For instance, at 395 the juxtaposition of terms in tò croýóv 8 ' ou ao&lt;ļ)ia, 'cleverness is not wisdom', is part of a subtle inquiry into the meaning of wisdom/cleverness; likewise, at 31 1-12 Dionysus plays on words with the stem 8ok- to ironize Pentheus' helplessness and misjudgement: [ir'8 ' , fjv 8okt'ç piv, fi 8è 8ó£a aou vocrfļ, | &lt;ļ&gt;povelv ôókéi tl, 'nor, if you have a belief, and your believing is sick, believe that you are being wise'. At 504, Dionysus calls himself acocf&gt;povcov où aaxļ&gt;poaiv, 'someone who has sense' dealing with 'people who 190 The reference is possibly to Polyidos , fr. 638; see Dover (1993) 328. 191 Funerary gold leaf, text in Riedweg (1998), quoted by Seaford (2003) 144. 192 Cf. above, Chapter I p. 27. 193 Contrast above p. 66 n. 23 on Euripides' usage of the 'composite mind-pattern' as parodie. 194 Seaford (2003) 163, quoting Goldhill (2000) 56. 195 Seaford on Segal (Seaford 1998a). 196 179, 186, 247, 31 1-12, 827-28, 369, 395, 504, 578-79, 655, 786-88, 803, 896, 905, 907, 913, 924, 927, 955, 960, 969-70, 971, 996, 1042, 1050, 1073, 1075, 1084, 1111, 1123, 1152 (xpfpa P and Chr. Pat. 1147; KTf||±a Orio and Diggle) 1 184, 1190, 1193, 1197, 1260, 1297, 1328, 1358. It is interesting to note that examples are most frequent in the second part of the play (after line 810), where they emphasize and problematize in parallel with Pentheus' explicit derangement.</page><page sequence="216">208 HIDDEN PATHS have no sense', emphasizing the opposition between his knowledge and the presumptuous ignorance of Pentheus and the helplessness of his police; at 655, again, the repetition of the adjective aocfróç (crcxfiòç aocfròç au, ttXt1v a bel a ' eivai GO&lt;póv, 'clever, clever you are, except in that in which you ought to be clever') introduces a discourse on different kinds of wisdom. At 913, the king's flawed attitude towards the divine world and his own role is again expressed as literal opposition: the king is the one aTTÉÚôovTá t ' àaTToúôaaTa, 'striving what should not be striven for'. At 924 and 927 we have repetition of different forms of the verb 'see', first with reference to Pentheus (vvv 8 ' ópaç ä XPÁ a ' ópâv, 'now you see what you should see', where different kinds of seeing, lucid sight and hallucination, are brought together) and secondly to the god, who claims 'to see the women when I look at you', aírràç èK€ivaç eiaopáv ôokû a ' opův, hinting at a problematizing of the concept of seeing and appearing, which is one of the keys to the relationship between the two characters.

At 960, the same procedure is applied to Xapßavcü, 'I catch', as connected to Pentheus' plans for catching the women, and to his own eventual capture, when Dionysus says to the king: 'you will catch', Xfjijrç) the Maenads, or else 'you will be caught', Xr)&lt;J&gt;0f1ç by them. The active and passive verbs here juxtaposed emphasize the symmetry between the aggressive intentions of Pentheus and his destiny as victim, between what he despises or fears and what he desires. A dialectic between passive and active is also apparent at 803 where, in his fear of seeming weak in the face of the women, Pentheus refuses to be SouXeúovTa SouXeíais*, 'a slave to his own slaves'. Active and passive seeings are again conjoined at 1050: the king's plan is to go on the mountain to spy (To see without being seen', optopev oùx ópcopevot) but he ends up, at 1075, seen rather than seeing ('rather than seeing the Maenads he was seen by them', (S4&gt;0r) 8è paXXov f' Karelbe paiváôas*). Agave, in her derangement, is also characterized by verbal juxtaposition. At 1123 she is ou &lt;f&gt;povoua ' a XP¿) &lt;1&gt;poveiv , 'not thinking as she should think', and at 1193, when she asks the chorus èTraiveîç;, 'do you praise?' (meaning 'praise' herself for her hunt), their reply is èíraivco, 'I praise' (meaning 'praise' the god, for his triumph). In the same fashion, at 1197 the chorus replies to her boasting about her hunt with the comment TTcpiaaau ('excessive' or 'strange spoil', in Dodds' translation)197 to which she adds TTepiaacos* ('strangely' - or 'grandly' - 'taken'), clearly not detecting the negative implication of the chorus' comment. These are among the more readily analysed instances of polyptoton and repetition; many other occurrences, however, work within the idiom of repetition and obsessive insistence that characterizes the play as a whole,198 and certain situations in particular (madness, at 930 and 1183; incredulity and self-denial, at 1177 and 1181-82) or certain characters in particular (as with povos*, 'alone', applied to Cadmus and Tiresias, and 197 Dodds (1960) 225. 198 Anaphora and anadiplosis: 195-96, 361-62, 506, 515, 655, 741 and 753, 930, 962-63, 971, 995, 1065, 1 146 assonance, 1 153-54, 1 177, 1 181-82, 1 183, 1 199, 1242-43. For repetitions, see Chapter II, pp. 80-81.</page><page sequence="217">CHAPTER 4: TRAGEDY AND CHARACTER 209 Pentheus, respectively at 195-96 and 962-63). Some instances, conversely, invite an ad hoc response, such as the notorious 'etymology' in the references to Pentheus' name,199 and the pointed word-play at 794-95, where Dionysus tells Pentheus that '[if I were you] I would sacrifice to him rather than get angry and kick against the goads', Gúoip. ' àv airrco pâXXov Tļ Gup-ouiaevous* I irpò? icévTpa XaKTÍ£oi|ii. Here the play on Guio, 'I sacrifice', and GuļioDļiai, 'I get angry', foregrounds two crucial aspects of Pentheus' flawed character: his refusal to worship and his uncontrolled temper. A rather different, but no less relevant, stylistic mechanism is oxymoron. It is applied to the duplicity of human cunning (at 334, KaTcuļjeuSou KaXûç, 'lie beautifully = for a good cause'), and especially to the paradoxes of the divine. Thus, we encounter ttovov f)8uv, 'sweet toil' (66) and Kap.aTov...£ÙKàpaTov, 'weariness happily unwearying' (67). At 113-14, we have d|i&lt;J&gt;l 8è vdpGrjKaç ußpiaTa?

Seaford also cites the exchange at 966-70 as juxtaposition of opposites, motherhood and savage hostility.200 Deceptive idiom used by one character to another also deserves our attention. In marked contrast to Aeschylus' usage of equivalent, or seemingly equivalent, patterns, where the effect is to enhance the common understanding of an expression,201 the meta- lingual 'discourse on words' in Bacchae evokes a bewildering ambiguity and doubleness in the characters' perception and a relativization of meaning. Relativity of meaning is the lesson of Tiresias in his theological exposition on Demeter, at 276 (Tf' 8 ' ècrriv, ovoļia 8 ÓTTÓTcpov ßouXii KáXei, 'she is Earth, call her by whichever name you wish') and at 296 (where he explains the myth of Dionysus' second birth in terms of linguistic shifts: ovoļia |i6TaaTf|CTavT6ç. 'having changed the word...'). In many instances Pentheus appears baffled and bewildered by Dionysus' utterances. At 475 Pentheus sneers, tout' 6Kiß8f|X6uaa?

('what you say is right again! How clever you are, and have been all along!'). Free speech in the presence of the king is typically something that induces hesitation on the part of other characters in the play - ironically enough, as he, in the meantime, is made victim of the most subtle verbal deception. At 668-69, the herdsman asks TTÓTepd ooL TTappTļaia I &lt;f&gt;páaio Ta Keiöev f| Xòyov aTeiXcLpeOa ('whether I can tell you with freedom of speech the news from there, or whether I should draw in the sail of my report'). At 775-76 the chorus expresses the same concern, Tapßü 'iev eiirelv tou? Xóyouç èXeuGépou? I irpò? tòv Tupauuou ('I am frightened to speak free words to the tyrant').202 Sometimes play on words is conducted behind a character's back, for the understanding of the audience, as (again) when etymological attention is drawn to Pentheus' name. With its deceptions and ambiguities, and its insistence on the superficial understanding possessed by the characters as against fuller, universal understanding open to the audience or reader, Bacchae is preeminently a drama of irony, where the Aeschylean solemnity of oxymoron and oppositional stylistic device is evoked and, if not mocked, certainly demystified. Irony is a feature more characteristic of drama than (say) the novel. As Rosenmeyer says, in the novel characters talk to each other, while in drama 'the actor-character addresses the audience, sometimes over the head of his fellow-characters, sometimes through them'.203 Rosenmeyer's distinction between four types of irony is useful here: forensic, blind, structural and metatheatrical ( Fiktionsironie ). Forensic irony is the clearest and most naturalistic kind, accomplished by a single character, 'via a single formulation, designed to hurt a victim', and realized immediately by the audience. Blind irony shows up the ignorance of the agent or victim, is 'contributed by a single character... no simulation is involved; audience perception varies from immediate to delayed'. Structural irony is an 'enactment of systemic disparity... contributed by the text or the argument rather than the character... the text reveals a disparity between passages or actions or events. The perception of the audience is slow... the audience frequently joins the characters in loco victimae' ' Fiktionsironie ', finally, is a rupture of dramatic illusion. This kind is contributed directly by the author: 'the perception of the audience can be from immediate to perplexed... the audience is always, the character(s) sometimes, in loco • • » 204 victimae . Of these four, only the second and third types are typical of tragedy, as Lowe has rightly noted:205 what is characteristic of the genre , he argues, is the suppression of a 202 The herdsman, however, queries Pentheus' hyperbolic idiom about the shameful behaviour of the women at 686-88, saying that '[they are] not, as you say, drunk from the mixing bowl and with the sound of the pipe hunting Aphrodite in the wood', oùx Û? au «M?

We find simple (forensic) irony - above all, with Dionysus to Pentheus, 'now you reason as you should!' (948), 'you are the only one who dares...' (962-63). We find blind irony, as when Cadmus tells the king, K€i pf] yàp Igtiv ò 06 òç ovtoç, œç (jv &lt;J&gt;t|ç ('even if, as you say, this is not the god', 333), or when Agave insists she wants to see the son she has just killed (1212-15), or when the king admits, XuTTpuj? viv eiaiôoip ' àv ('it would give me pain to see them drunk', 814).208 Structural irony is richly present, as in the whole motif of seeing, or as when the god assures Pentheus that things can still be sorted out (802). Finally, many (of course) have felt that the last type, metatheatrical irony, is crucial, in the dressing-up scene, notably, and in the beheading of Pentheus as 'reduction to mask'.209 This co-presence of types and degrees of irony is as important as any other single factor in undermining any stable view of facts and reality in the play. We have characters trying to be superficially ironic, like Pentheus with the stranger, at their first encounter ('well, you are not ugly in body, stranger!', 453 ff.); or like the two elderly men ('if your white-haired old age was not there to save you, you would be sitting tied up in the middle of the Bacchants, introducing pernicious initiation rituals!', 258-60); or like Agave, mildly berating the now dead Pentheus ('fighting against deity is the only thing he can do', 1255- 56). Then we have characters being seriously, heavily ironic, like Dionysus. And finally we have structural irony on a constitutive scale - as with the contrast between Dionysus' authoritative promises in the prologue, what he will actually do, and what will happen in point of fact. Unlike many features of style, irony is not intensified by addition. The staging of 'irony over irony', and the competitive co-presence of various kinds of ironist within a larger structural irony, enforce, as a result, the depiction of a world where stable meanings are denied, and where an objective representation of man is no longer possible. Furthermore, one may argue that the incorporation of the divine plotmaker-ironist within his creation behind his victim's shoulders is one of the key-factors in allowing 'novelistic' features of characterization such as verbal accumulation, motifemic insistence and characterful imagery, through which the characters' complete lack of awareness emerges. In conclusion, the representation of character in a play is not only conveyed through 'anthropomorphic' means, but also through features such as style and narcological facts which escape a straightforward identification with human traits and are specific to literary creation - what we called 'supra-personal' aspects. In the first part of this work we explored how the representation of self and the outside world, which are contiguous and 206 Lowe (1996) 529. '[Greek] tragedy's irony is not merely verbal... but "practical"; it problematizes issues of knowledge and teleology not by textual play alone, but by its vivid concreti zation of the Homeric hierarchy of modal worlds'. 207 However, see Stanford (1939) 162, rightly opposing in this respect (Homer and) Aeschylus to Sophocles: 'Homer and Aeschylus work more in direct sympathy with their characters than does Sophocles with his Oedipus... the Sophoclean deceptions work over the heads of his character'; and 164, 'Sophocles kept his audiences continually aware of his guiding hand'. 208 Rosenmeyer (1996) 513. 209 On which see above, Chapter IV.3, pp. 186-89.</page><page sequence="220">212 HIDDEN PATHS interrelated in literary texts and especially in Greek tragedy, offer in Bacchae an image of mental life as interiorized and incommunicable to others, often absent from the subject's consciousness. Conversely, we described the world of Bacchae as lacking a stable structure in religious, social or political terms. These two convergent qualities are obviously reflected not only in the utterances made by characters or in the literal events taking place, but also in the 'way the story is told', for instance in the imagery employed by the poet. Literary characters, in fact, are not only an anthropomorphic, two- dimensioned representation of a dramatic persona . If taken in such a naïve way they would no doubt be revealed as the chimaera which post-modernist deconstructions criticize. Literary characters are constructed through literal' verbal means, as well as through the narrative and style adopted in the single play, which must be taken into consideration if we want to understand the portrayal of man in a text. To ignore them would be as to judge a human being by looking at a photograph of the person, thus overlooking the moods, relationships and reactions which ultimately define him or her. Style and narcological facts are, so to speak, in a text what the 'moods', the 'reactions', the 'relationships' which surround a person are in real life.</page><page sequence="221">CONCLUSIONS ÓSoÍ)Ç 6pf|ļIOU9 11-L6 V 'we shall take hidden paths' Ba. 841 'Hidden paths' work here at multiple levels. They are the paths along which Pentheus will walk, following the proposal made by the god, in order to reach the mountain through secret roads and escape the notice of his fellow citizens. At the same time, 'hidden paths' allude to our itineraries, those we used to reconstruct characterization in tragedy through the study of keywords and stylistic aspects, through which character is made to emerge but which are often invisible to the naked eye. Finally, they are also relevant to the personality of Bacchae' s main character, Pentheus, whose availability to go to his death 'through hidden paths' summarizes his portrayal as isolated, detached and unwitting human being. Accordingly, this work has combined two trails of research: a broader reflection on the notion of character in a literary text with its methodological implications, and an analysis of the representation of characters in Euripides' Bacchae , which has worked as a case- study. We should add a few words on both, starting from the latter part of this work, the Bacchae . Euripides' last play has enjoyed a great deal of attention in the last decades. In recent scholarship the connection between the play and a 'crisis' of the polis has been increasingly (if not unanimously) emphasized. The results of this research agree with this general tendency and illustrate how the depiction of human beings in the play points to a lack of religious, political and ultimately 'existential' stability. Here, however, 'crisis' is understood in a deeper sense from the one meant by many modern readers. 'Crisis' can be meant as the presence of referential elements allusive to the collapse of community's foundations (in Bacchae , one may quote the despairing ending of the play, the unfair quality of divine prescription and revenge and the perverted family relations). Also, crisis can be meant as failure to address all these problems in an appropriate way. Usually commentators analyse 'crisis' in Bacchae in the first sense. To deal with the 'critical', however, to dramatize instances of failure and downfall is ingrained in the tragic genre overall. Referential aspects of crisis in tragedy are certainly not exclusive to the Bacchae : elements such as contradictory family relations, the problematic quality of divine prescriptions and a destructive outcome are central in other plays; the Agamemnon and the Choephoroi , OT, and Hippolytus are only four of many possible examples. It is with respect to the human reaction to these threats, on the contrary, that the Bacchae appears to be taking a step further, in the direction taken by Sophocles' OC, with its acknowledgement of human love 'that overthrows I all tasks of work' as parallel, or 213</page><page sequence="222">214 HIDDEN PATHS even alternative, compensation to divine mystery.1 It is the road taken by other Euripidean plays in which god betrays and disappoints man, as in the Ion , or in which human isolation in madness is redressed by the solidarity of a fellow human being, as in the Heracles. This shift of focus onto the human world will be accomplished in fourth-century comedy with its withdrawal into the private microcosmos of family relations. The 'human reaction* to crisis dramatized in the play can be summarized under one formula, lack of awareness of characters and denial of an accessible world-order. This lack of awareness results in a gap between what Aristotle called f^Gos* ('that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents') and ôiavoia ('thought') on the one hand, and TTpâ£iç, 'the construction of events' on the other.2 This gap becomes the repository of character. In Pentheus' complete inability to express his deeper concerns and desires, and in his unwitting vulnerability to the challenges posed by the god, much of the final 'effect' of his characterization is contained. In this construction of character by omission, as a consequence, language is forced to declare its arbitrariness and admit its artifice. The combination of these three, unaware and isolated self, 'fall' of the world and unreliable, artificial, no longer 'ontological' language determine the inadequate response to crisis in the play. This crisis is not simply described in terms of the 'events going on' (Dionysus allegedly being represented as a cruel and irrational god, and Pentheus being undeservedly destroyed). It goes beyond the representation of the god(s), of authority, of family as corrupted and unreliable, finally exposing the faulty way in which characters deal with the crisis and eventually do or do not overcome it. What betrays the fundamental mistrust in the order of the world is not so much the cruel nature of Dionysus or the foolishness of Pentheus, but the main human characters' lack of awareness and the perfunctory nature of their suffering. This study argues that there is a radicalization in the last Euripidean play of the critical themes which are at the core of the tragic genre overall. Why do we find such radicalization in the Bacchael Should we take this literary expression as linked to the specific historical moment, or rather to the idiosyncratic sensibility of the author and to the nature of that one play? One may note that at various stages in the history of man comparable feelings about self, world and language seem to surface with varying intensity. At the turn of the twentieth century Hoffmanstahl's fictional Lord Chandos confesses, in a letter to the empirical philosopher Francis Bacon, that 'he can no longer write any poem or prose', overwhelmed as he is by his inability to appreciate his place within the harmony of the natural world, a harmony which is now completely lost to him. The loss of contact with the world and with the society of people results for the writer in the bankruptcy of verbal communication itself: 'the language in which it might perhaps have been given to me not only to write, but also to think is neither Latin nor English nor Italian nor Spanish, but a language in which mute things speak to me, and in which I may once, in my grave, have to account for myself before an unknown Judge'.3 1 OC (1615-16). 2 Po. 1449b- 1450a. * Hoffmanstahl (1995) 20.</page><page sequence="223">CONCLUSIONS 215 The Euripidean Pentheus reminds us of these feelings about nature and language. With all the necessary distinctions we can compare Pentheus' impasse, lack of orientation and isolation from the world outside with lord Chandos' modern misery. It is a misery much deeper than the one caused by a mistrust towards an unfathomable divine justice, by the disenchantment with rationality and the caution towards irrationality - it is not the despair of the Aeschylean Orestes, not that of the Sophoclean Oedipus, but a despair deprived of an external frame to lean on, one which cannot find words to define itself. Remshardt, in his argument for the Bacchae as 'grotesque play', puts it as follows: in his last work Euripides 'is waiting this side of modernity with his implicit distrust in the rational and the irrational alike ... [retorting that] "nothing is intelligible and very little is beautiful. In fact, most things are grotesque'".4 The parallel with Hoffmanstahl attempts an 'historical' interpretation of the crisis we find in the Bacchae , linked to the challenges posed to the Athenian political and cultural reality at the end of the fifth century. One may also argue that the feeling of a 'loss of the centre' in the play is to be taken as peculiar to the author and to that text, an individual viewpoint, a category embedded in the literary style and poetics of Euripides, and nothing else. It might have to do with a basic category of the spirit, one of these synthesized, with a happy intuition, as 'hedgehogs' and 'foxes' by Isaiah Berlin in his study of Tolstoy. Borrowing the animal imagery of an Archilochean fragment5 Berlin proposed to distinguish writers and thinkers in two broad categories. The first 'relate everything to a single central vision, one system, less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel', and the second 'pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, for some physiological or psychological cause, related by no moral or aesthetical principle'. Even though Berlin barely mentions ancient authors, we are made to think that if Aeschylus is a 'hedgehog', Euripides is a 'fox', and the Bacchae is perhaps the most 'foxy' of all his works for the variety of viewpoints and the conflicting forces that animate it without prevailing decisively one over the other.6 Whether the critical outlook expressed in the play is understood as an expression of a social and cultural malaise or as Euripides' personal perspective, what is crucial is that this deeper crisis emerges beyond the referential features of dramatic events. Through lan- guage and stylistic devices we receive an opaque and impenetrable presentation of human beings, whose deeper self is unutterable and absurd beyond rationality and irrationality, as they are both questioned and bewared of. As to the more general part of the argument, developed in Chapter I, the methodological results reached have validity for other related and comparable texts beyond the specific example of Bacchae. A focus on characterization as ultimately a product, achieved through verbal and stylistic means is especially fruitful in analysing other literary examples of human representation. 4 Remshardt (2004) 135 (my italics), engaging with Nietzsche's view of Euripides as the Socratic dramatist for whom 'to be beautiful everything must be intelligible' {The Birth of Tragedy, 83-84). 5 Archilochus fr. 201, 'the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing', ttóXX ' ol8 ' áXtÓTTT|£, àXX' éxívoç p.¿ya. 6 Berlin (1953) 3-4.</page><page sequence="224">216 HIDDEN PATHS In my search for instantiations of character in the Bacchae I have concentrated on keywords, on the usage of linguistic elements and on various stylistic devices on the premise that character should be considered primary as the product of a verbal operation. This suggestion might seem obvious. However, the verbal level has not always been foregrounded in recent interpretations and remains the domain of the commentary, the official locus where a play is considered as unique and finite text. On the other hand, more 'engaged' studies, as notably Segal's monograph or Seaford's works on the Bacchae , have been with reference to a wider frame of interpretation, characteristically granting equal weight to evidence from the text and evidence from outside it. For Seaford this frame was Dionysiac rituals and the polis. For Segal, it was an idea of 'Dionysiac poetics' as super- historical and drawing directly from what was understood to be a universal category of the human. For both, however, interpretation stemmed from the chosen frame in a deductive fashion. My analysis of the play, instead, has proceeded inductively, starting from the text to reach the wider interpretative frame, as characters in a play differ from real people in their being creatures of words, existing through words and therefore being delimited by the constraints of verbal expression, as well as gaining power and intensity of meaning from the specificity of these constraints. A correlate methodological point put forward in the present work is a wariness of the 'derivative' move common to many interpretations otherwise very different from one another. Literary works are too often related to some external factor (society, or religion, but also more abstract elements such as Segal's 'god who dissolves limits' or Girard's 'reciprocal violence') by a cause-effect relation that bypasses, again, the textual and verbal level. In this fashion, historicizing studies of the play, as much as those professing a pluralist and post-modern viewpoint, take the text as a pretext to develop broader concerns. Despite important differences among themselves, Bacchae' s recent readings put at the core of their interpretation 'referential' aspects such as the cultural milieu , the social context, the political environment, 'literature'. In this way, they centre their reading of the play on an assumed derivative process of the text from these aspects, as if the text were the intersection of these many areas, their predetermined and unavoidable outcome. By doing this, both historicizing and post-modern studies imply that the road from reference to text should be direct. The 'because' factor {i.e., the literary text displays certain characteristics because of 'reference') is always prevalent over the 'despite' factor {i.e., the literary text is in a certain way despite reference). I propose to consider reference as the 'stuff', the instruments through which deeper aspects are made to emerge, aspects whose real genesis is ultimately unaccessible to us. Complementary to overcoming the unavoidable limitedness of the text by historical framing, or by 'opening it' to its relations and interactions, we should also seek for meaning within that limitedness. The fact that this book emphasizes history of ideas and cultural premises does not contradict the above. I have claimed that a trust in world-order explains a certain view of man, and representation of character. Yet I concentrated my interpretation on the gap between reference and text - considering significant, to give only a few examples, that the play should often represent the god Dionysus as a distant and hostile presence despite the many positive elements that the god entailed in the culture of the time; that the punishment of men and women in the play has a quality of intentional randomness and mechanicity despite the availability of different representations of theomachiœ, that</page><page sequence="225">CONCLUSIONS 217 Pentheus should display a lack of awareness and closure to the outside, consistent throughout, despite the relevance of mental life analysis in other plays where the representation of madness is foregrounded. By privileging discrepancy to analogy I have sought to highlight the specifics of literature, as well as the peculiarities of the Bacchae. In this way, the play is read as a 'metaphor for the way things are'.7 In the same way as metaphor is said to defamiliarize words by using them in an unusual combination, a play deviates from the presentation of reality which is familiar to the audience. It is not read, on the other hand, as 'a metonymy of the way things are', simply based on an extension or delimitation of the familiar, and potentially decoded on the basis of reference alone. It is ultimately how our play deals with its models, with its political context, with the Dionysiac element, with the fashions and politics of the age, with the conventions of society that make it - as is the case for any other play - unique. A methodological approach that privileges the verbal level and considers each text as a unicum is an antidote to interpretative overload, as well as an access to levels otherwise confined to the line-by- line commentary. 7 Gould (1987a) 62</page><page sequence="226">TABLES For the reader's convenience, the tables here include those set out in earlier chapters.
