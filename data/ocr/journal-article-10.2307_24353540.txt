<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Applied Philosophy, Vol. 9, No. 1, 1992 45 Towards a More Expansive Moral Community MARK BERNSTEIN abstract I argue for a broader understanding of the morally considerable. I propose a neo-Aristotelian account of individuals wherein some entities, often precluded from those deserving of moral consideration, are deemed proper subjects of such treatment. The criterion suggested is, roughly, that of self-regulatory development, a teleological notion, that I argue should not be viewed as archaic and useless. Not only do many non-human animals then become legitimate subjects of moral concern, but objects outside the animal kingdom, such as plants and trees, also are to be included in our ethical arena. We normal human beings take ourselves to be paradigmatic of the morally consider able. That is, we understand ourselves as being exemplars of those types of individuals who can serve as objects of morally right and wrong behaviour. Although we believe ourselves to be the most conspicuous members of this class, we do not take ourselves as exhausting it. We typically grant membership to gods, human infants and many non-human animals. On the other hand, we withhold membership from the great majority of the world's inhabitants. We believe that there can be only amoral treatment of tables, chairs and pens. In addition, there is debate, often heated, concerning the moral status of some individuals. We scarcely need to read beyond the front page of our daily newspaper to survey discussions of the moral considerability of (some) non human animals and human fetuses. This common way of carving up the world presupposes a certain conception of moral considerability. While its modern philosophical foundations can be traced to Descartes and Kant, it survives intact in the ethical writings of G. J. Warnock [1], Joel Feinberg [2] and Peter Singer [3], among others. I want to suggest that this 'traditional account', its pre-reflective appeal notwithstanding, is unduly restrictive. We require a broader and less parochial vision of what beings deserve moral consideration. After articulating and criticising the traditional account, I will outline the contents of such a vision, which, curiously enough, has affinities with an ancient view of the nature of things. I It is a virtual truism that to be legitimately considered as a moral patient, as one meriting moral consideration, one must have the capacity to be made better and worse off. That is, some acts must be good for (or help) the individual in question and some must be bad for (or harm) that individual. If the nature of a particular being prohibits these acts from occurring, then, whatever else may be true of the individual, it does not warrant moral consideration. This I will propose as the foundation-stone for any viable theory of moral consideration. As merely a formal, rather than substantive criterion this requirement can be instantiated in many ways. One way of understanding the</page><page sequence="2">46 M. Bernstein differences between any theories of moral consideration, and in particular between the traditional conception and the one that will later be sketched, is to reflect upon the distinct ways each theory accounts for the possibility of an individual being helped or harmed. The traditional account requires experienceability for justified moral consideration. That is, entities that deserve moral attention need to be such that they can experience the world. They must, minimally, have the capability of conscious thought and awareness. There must be, to use Nagelian language, something that it is like to be them. The powerful intuition is that if an entity lacks even the possibility of an experiential life, it makes no sense to think of behaviour toward it as being either good or bad. A being which cannot experience cannot have anything done to it that matters to it. If nothing can matter to a being, no moral behaviour can be appropriated toward it. Although one cannot infer from the fact that experienceability is necessary for moral consideration that it is the actual or possible experiences which make their possessor morally matter, the traditional view has subscribed to this implication. This is quite understandable; it would be a queer doctrine that proclaimed experienceability neces sary for the subject of justified moral ascriptions and yet held that something other than (actual or possible) experiences played the efficacious role in making an individual morally matter. If some property other than experienceability is doing all the work, to speak of the capability to experience as a key notion in the account is obviously misleading. The references to "actual and possible" experiences are not ornamental. It is only by taking this description seriously that certain paradoxes of the traditional account can be avoided. The painless administration of a general anaesthetic prior to the decapita tion of an individual scarcely disqualifies the latter action from being a harm. What constitutes this harm, according to the traditional account, is that it prevents the subject from having any further experiences whatsoever, and this, Epicurean concerns to the side, is bad for the patient. Undoubtedly, a painful death is an even greater harm, and so the anaesthesia can be viewed as mitigating, but nonetheless the unaware victim suffers incalculably. Similar suffering can befall an individual in less drastic surroundings. Unaware that she is being unfairly deprived of a job promotion, a woman will not undergo negative or painful experiences. Still these privations are harmful in that they prevent the woman from having the opportunity of future positive or pleasurable experiences. In the contemporary debates concerning the scope of the morally considerable, we find a common allegiance to the traditional conception. Recall that Descartes's invective against those who would grant moral status to non-human animals relied upon his belief that such creatures essentially lacked consciousness. Mere automata, they were relatively complex machines which endured careers, but did not live lives. Necessarily without consciousness, forever without the ability to experience, no behaviour could matter to them. Humans who care for the sake of these animals have misappropriated part of their affective life; there are no sakes for which to care. Anti Cartesians, in the form of contemporary animal liberation theorists, have expended much energy in trying to demonstrate that excellent reasons exist to believe in non human animal consciousness [4]. Thus, both parties to the debate minimally share the supposition that consciousness is a necessary condition for moral considerability. This assumption plays a similar role for many involved in the abortion debate. Claims by both sides make clear that the question of fetal consciousness, or more especially fetal pain, is crucial to what treatment is merited by fetuses. The ability to</page><page sequence="3">Towards a More Expansive Moral Community 47 experience is taken to demarcate a mere clump of cells from a person, a morally inconsiderable thing from a morally considerable individual. Undeniably, the traditional account has enormous appeal. Indeed, a plausible alterna tive is unlikely. After all, how can behaviour matter to an individual, other than mattering experientially, i.e. as either causing actual pleasant or unpleasant experi ences, or influencing the content of possible future experiences? Some philosophers have taken up the gauntlet by suggesting that there are relatively mundane examples that run counter to the traditional account [5], While no positively unpleasant experiences accrue to a person who is unknowingly ridiculed, it is natural to think of such a person as being harmed. In a similar vein, harm may befall someone posthumously. Consider the example of its mistakenly being commonly accepted that a dead artist's paintings, heretofore considered great original pieces of art, are mere derivative reproductions. This debate, though interesting in its own right, is not an avenue I wish to pursue. First, because it is not my aim to enter into a protracted, and probably fruitless, debate concerning whether it is the person or merely the person's reputation that is suffering injury. More importantly for my purposes, such alleged counter-examples to the traditional account are not radical enough to illuminate why the received account is ultimately unsatisfactory. The problem with these putative examples of unexperienced harms is that their harmfulness, even in the case where it is suffered posthumously, is most naturally accounted for by reference to experiences. So, for example, ridicule behind one's back is viewed as a harm, since we can naturally presume that if the subject were aware of such conversation, he would be annoyed and would want it stopped. Similarly, in the scenario where one's paintings are posthumously considered worthless copies of original art, the harm to the deceased is assumedly accounted for by the fact that, were he alive and aware of these eventualities, he would be greatly saddened, i.e. he would undergo negative experiences. Can we supply cases where an individual is harmed and yet the harm is not, indeed cannot be, accounted for in terms of actual or even counterfactual experiences? Consider the example where we ensure the demise of a redwood tree by withholding from it adequate amounts of water. We naturally see this as a harm to the tree, as an action which is bad for it. Compare this to the mistreatment of a great painting (say, for example, by allowing it to remain unprotected in direct sunlight for many months) or of a group of stones serving as a landmark (say, for example, by allowing visitors to deface it with graffiti). A significant difference exists between the maltreatment of the tree and that of the painting (or landmark), a difference highlighted by focusing on the significantly different natures of trees and paintings. Trees, unlike paintings, are organisms that naturally develop and have within themselves the capability of repairing damage and adapting, to at least some extent, to unfavourable surroundings. It is quite natural, indeed virtually automatic, to think of a tree's career in teleological terms, in which its life is viewed as a journey to reach a fully mature state. Paintings and landmarks, regardless of their beauty or function, have none of these associations. I suggest we take talk of a tree or plant as suffering harm as a result of being subjected to less than adequate water, seriously and unmetaphorically, and that we explicate this harm in terms of the lack of water hindering the natural development of the tree. Analogously, the plant is the subject of aid if it is placed in an area with</page><page sequence="4">48 M. Bernstein sufficient sunlight, where this good for the plant is explicated in terms of its being permitted, indeed encouraged, to develop normally. This view incorporates no mystery as to which kinds of behaviour constitute good and ill treatments of these entities incapable of conscious experience. If a dead tomato plant is the inevitable result of its being put in rich sulphate soil, we may reasonably conclude that this treatment is not in the plant's interest. On the other hand, if regular pruning is regularly followed by robust fruit, we may infer that these activities are in the plant's interest. None of these remarks is intended as an argument for linguistic revision. There is nothing untoward or problematic in speaking of blackboards suffering harm by being scratched, or cars being caused injury by being filled up with poor quality petrol. On the preferred theory, since chalkboards and cars are not developing organisms, these harms are explicable in terms of the disutility suffered by individuals who use these entities as resources. The harms (or goods) that befall chalkboards and cars, are, so to speak, only 'indirect', in that were it not for the use that we make of them, there would be no negative effects suffered by the chalkboards' being scratched or the cars' being fed inferior petrol. This is diametrically opposed to the nature of the harm suffered by trees and plants. In these cases, the harms are direct, i.e. the organisms themselves suffer and would suffer regardless of the use, if any, that other creatures make of them. The traditionalist might claim that little argument has been provided for endowing individuals such as plants and trees with moral considerability. That is, though a sense has been given to the notion that such entities can be harmed, this goes little way toward a commitment embracing these beings into our moral community. The point can be put in either of two equivalent ways: (1) the harms that befall trees, plants, etc. are of a significantly different sort from those that matter for moral consideration, and so are only called 'harms' by courtesy; (2) the harms suffered by trees, plants, etc. are legitimate, full-blown harms, but this merely demonstrates that there is not the intimate connection that some might have believed between an individual that can be harmed and an individual meriting moral consideration. Paul Taylor has tried to justify the idea that a non-sentient teleological entity deserves to be morally considered. He explains his notion of teleology. To say it is a teleological center of life is to say that its internal functioning as well as its external activities are all goal-oriented, having the constant tendency to maintain the organism's existence through time and to enable it successfully to perform those biological operations whereby it reproduces its kind and continually adapts to changing environmental events and condi tions. It is the coherence and unity of these functions of an organism, all directed toward the realization of its good, that make it one teleological center of activity. [6] Taylor continues by telling us that these functions are not merely species-specific, but individualised as well. Indeed, this individual-specific function is the essence of that individual, for the "organism is the individual it is precisely in virtue of its having its own idiosyncratic manner of carrying on its existence in the (not necessarily con scious) pursuit of its good... once aware of this particular function, "... we have reached the most complete realization, cognitively and imaginatively, of what it is</page><page sequence="5">Towards a More Expansive Moral Community 49 to be that particular individual..." [7]. Taylor tells us how the transition from objects with particular teleologies to objects deserving moral consideration is effected: Shifting out of the usual boundaries of anthropocentricity, the world-horizon of our moral imagination opens up to encompass all living things. Seeing them as we see ourselves, we are ready to place the same value on their existence as we do on our own ... [8] The argument is analogical. We humans (appropriately) take ourselves to be the models of moral considerability. Our individual goal-orientated, developmental activi ties are what constitute our individual essences. Reflection shows that all life possesses similar teleological centres and so all life should be viewed as deserving the same sort of moral consideration that we assign to ourselves. Recently, this argument has come under attack. An objection put forward by G. H. Paske [9] claims that, once we dispense with the anthropomorphic talk of goals, we will find that the teleology of a non-sentient life form is essentially equivalent to that of an inanimate being. Although the teleology of a protozoan is governed by biophysical and biochemical processes while the teleology of a stalactite is governed by physical chemical processes, we are dealing with a distinction without a difference. At the bottom, continues the objection, all processes are physical-chemical, the prefix 'bio' just being a, perhaps temporary, human convenience. This pragmatic, chauvinistic contrivance can hardly sustain the categorical moral distinction it is asked to bear. We are, therefore, left in the most uncomfortable position of permitting much of the inanimate world into our moral community if we countenance non-sentient life as deserving moral patienthood. We have considerability gone amok. Why accept the claim that talk of goals is merely metaphorical anthropomorphising? Paske's answer is "nonsentient life is not conscious and hence, literally, has no goals" [10]. This will hardly be persuasive to one who believes that we can, literally, speak of protozoa or even plants as having goals. Let us avoid this becoming a verbal dispute by conceding Paske's wish that the term 'goal' be used only in connection with conscious life forms. Still, the concept of 'goal-orientatedness' appears necessary even in Paske's scheme, as he allows us the literal truth that protozoa adapt to environmental changes. The process of adaptation, unlike the process of mere change, suggests both some end, aim or purpose (although not necessarily a conscious one) on the part of its subject to preserve its integrity, and some contribution to this process by the subject itself rather than a mere passive reaction to modifications in the environment. Perhaps Paske would allow that stalactities adapt to environmental changes [11], but it is difficult to understand how, for example, a stalactite under attack from acid water manifests such a goal-orientated process. Although Paske's argument is not compelling, it must be admitted that Taylor's discussion will not satisfy a traditionalist. The problem lies not so much in the analogical nature of the argument as in the considerations that Taylor advances for the interference with teleology as constituting a {prima facie) moral wrong. To act against the 'realisation of the good' of an entity, as we would when interfering with an entity's teleology, may seem, eo ipso, to constitute a morally wrong act. However, this inference is hardly so automatic when we recognise that the 'good' of an entity is, essentially, the entity's normal development; i.e. the individual's good, as Taylor (and I) use the term, though perhaps imbued with evaluative content, is without (obvious) moral content. The traditionalist would not be making any logical error, then, in refusing to see such interferences in moral terms.</page><page sequence="6">50 M. Bernstein The traditionalist, too, is hardly immjine from such manoeuvres. One can, also without logical error, reject the view that the infliction of pain is a (prima facie) moral wrong. The point here is that the autonomist (to coin a term for the apologist of the non-traditional theory), Taylor's attempts notwithstanding, must take interference with an individual's teleology as a type of fundamental moral wrong, just as the traditionalist takes the infliction of pain as a basic moral evil. The following thought experiment may convince some that the autonomist intuition is a fruitful moral addendum. Compare the case of ending the career of a developing organism (say, the killing of a normal adult human being) with that of preventing the creation of such an organism. Importantly, we must imagine that the actions in both cases foreclose congruent amounts of experienced pain and pleasure; that is, if the two lives were not aborted, they would contain qualitatively identical experiences. If the traditional view were completely satisfactory, our moral intuitions concerning these two cases should be the same: we should think of the killing and preventing as equally wrong. I suggest, however, that we discern a moral inequality; the killing is deemed worse. The only way to account for this difference in intuition appears to be by attributing some moral value to the development of the organism itself. We seem to believe, then, that something is wrong in interfering with an organism's natural development, and that this moral evil is independent of any consideration of projected experienced pains and pleasures. The idea that self-regulating, developing individuals constitute a distinctive meta physical category has a reputable history. Spinoza considered all modes, all parts of the infinitely extended substance, as endowed with conatus, an inherent 'desire' to preserve its own identity or integrity [12]. Spinoza identified this conatus with the essence of modes, an identification that magnifies the significance he attributed to it. Leibniz spoke, in a similar vein, about an appetitive principle unique to each individual monad [13]. The career of a monad was determined, in an organised formulaic way, by this regulative, directing principle. However, the progenitor of this idea, and in many ways the purveyor of a more fruitful analogue to the 'autonomy' view currently suggested, is Aristotle. We can view Spinoza's conatus and Leibniz's appetitive principle as variants of Aristotle's soul, in that all three serve as regulative principles for the development of ontic furniture. Enormous differences exist, especially the more discriminating use Aristotle made of his principle. Where, to Spinoza and Leibniz, the regulative principle could be found in literally everything, Aristotle's use of soul was far more circum scribed. In his Psychology he tells us that the presence of soul distinguishes the living from the dead, where the former is subject to both internal and external influences while the latter can be influenced only by activities originating outside itself. Only the natural world has such an internal principle; the artificial world is necessarily inanimate. Although a living being consists of both (material) body and soul, the soul directs and limits the possible activities that such a being can perform. To Aristotle, the mere possession of a soul had no moral implications. Hence, the mere presence of life did not qualify one as a moral patient. While plants had merely nutritive and sensitive needs, human beings had souls that also included rationality. Only with this final acquisition did moral considerability find a foothold.</page><page sequence="7">Towards a More Expansive Moral Community 51 What the autonomy theory of moral considerability asks is that we extend our attributions of animal patienthood to roughly those individuals with Aristotelian souls. The 'roughly' is a significant as well as suggestive qualification. Whether all living things manifest a regulative principle for self-development is I gather at least in part an empirical issue. The more interesting question is whether, as Aristotle believed, only natural, living things had souls. With recent advances in robotics, a self-initiating and self-regulating artifice is within reach. If such beings do come into existence, the autonomy theory dictates the need to include them into our moral calculus (although the extent to which they morally matter is left an open question). Thus, my autonomy theory, as least conceptually, is not committed to some Schweitzerian life principle which claims that all and only living individuals warrant direct moral consideration from moral agents [14]. The theory does imply a defeasible conservative stance on the abortion issue, in so far as the conceptus, as a self-regulating developing being, needs to be endowed with moral consideration. A fortiori, we are committed to a (defeasible) anti-vivisectionist position. Regardless of whether we regard these commitments as blessings or burdens, an inarguable virtue of the theory is that we no longer need be embroiled in discussions concerning the existence of fetal pain and animal conscious ness. I am not suggesting abandonment of the experienceability criterion for moral considerability. Instead, I offer a helpful, perhaps necessary supplement. I have argued that the plausibility that attaches to the claim that the production of pleasure (pain) is an intrinsic moral good (evil), resides as well in the claim that the encouragement (interference) of natural development is an intrinsic moral good (evil). The conse quence of this is that our legitimate moral community encompasses more than many of us suspected. Mark Bernstein, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78285-0643, USA.
