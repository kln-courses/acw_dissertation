<plain_text><page sequence="1">CEXOV'S THE STEPPE REVISITED Jerome H. Katsell, University of California, San Diego The writing of The Steppe (1888) was an important transition in texov's literary career.' Considerable evidence appears in his correspondence at- testing to the difficulties he encountered in producing such a lengthy piece suitable for the major "thick" literary journal Severnyj vestnik.2 (exov had earlier limited himself to short prose occasionally interruped by parodistic sorties into the province of the novel. He believed his efforts in an essentially new direction lacked the unity of a long prose fictional work (povest') and that The Steppe had become more like a series of rather complete short stories loosely tied together.3 Although he was correct to maintain that The Steppe presents a group of compact scenes tied together by the atmospheric steppe landscape and the nearly constant presence of Egoru'ka, Cexov placed little emphasis in his critical remarks about the story on the problem of personality development - a chief concern in most longer works of fic- tion. The depiction of inner evolution through experience, time, and many pages forced itself upon the author even though his avowed intention was to depict the steppe in its essence as a dynamic grouping of phenomena worthy of extended artistic treatment. Cexov complicated the problem of length by the selection of his central character in The Steppe. Here we find a nine-year-old provincial boy, Egoru'ka, whose point of view must be represented. Such a hero could not carry the entire narrative load of a story which conveys a highly complex evocation of the steppe. That responsibility would have to fall to an adult narrator-observer.4 Cexov's most obvious technical difficulty was thus to reconcile these two levels of narrative point of view. Many critics have not recognized this particular problem and have either taken one or the other narrative level to be dominant, or have spoken of a merging of narrative viewpoints.5 The resolution of such a narrative problem within The Steppe has, however, been discussed in depth by Nils Ake Nilsson and A. P. Cudakov.6 An elaboration of their views may help to clarify the difficulties faced by Cexov in writing this long story. As Nilsson interprets Cexov's intentions in The Steppe, the narrator- observer's viewpoint represents the steppe itself and all that Cexov wanted to say about it, while Egoru'ka's point of view represents the boy's percep- SEEJ, Vol. 22, No. 3 (1978) 313</page><page sequence="2">314 Slavic and East European Journal tion of his journey through the steppe, and nothing more. He notes that the subtitle of The Steppe, "The Story of a Journey," at least hints at the possibility of a narrative concerned with character development. The title is indicative of the overall unity Cexov was anxious to achieve; its subtitle suggests a series of transitions, perhaps points of plot development. For Nilsson, such good intentions fell short because of a basic incompatability between points of view: "In actual fact they [Egoru'ka's story and the evocation of the steppe] each required a narrative technique of their own" (47). Thus, Cexov's inability to successfully integrate the narrator-observer's and Egoru'ka's viewpoints may seem to undercut his attempt to provide the story with novelistic unity and transition. In fact he attempts to show that Cexov was far from consistent in his use of point of view, that Egoru'ka's narrative voice is at times intermingled unexpectedly with the narrator- observer's voice, and that the latter vacillates between the roles of a distan- ced objective commentator and an assertive, philosophical-poetical describer of wonderous natural phenomena. Ultimately, then, Nilsson is in accord with Cexov's judgment, expressed in so many letters, that The Steppe is an interesting experimental departure which failed to find a technique adequate to its narrative amplitude. The Steppe seen as a partial failure was certainly Cexov's oft expressed opinion. But at least one other view was ex- pressed in the letters: "I don't know if [The Steppe] is successful, but in any case it is my masterpiece, I can do no better" (XIV, 29). Whereas Nilsson seeks to focus on the putative difficulty Cexov ex- perienced in accomodating more than one major narrative voice (and several minor variations), Cudakov, in his Pobtika texova, attempts to con- vince us that Egoru'ka has almost no narrative voice whatsoever (107-23). It is Cudakov's belief that The Steppe represents a distinct anomaly within the narrative technique which dominates Cexov's "middle" period, 1888-94, in which a third-person, neutral, and objective viewpoint comes to the fore. For Cudakov, The Steppe looks forward to the technique he believes best characterizes Cexov's later prose (1895-1903): dominance by an authorial voice prone to explicatory and philosophical narrative intervention. Cudakov surveys the range of critical opinion concerning the narrative point of view in The Steppe (110; the critics mentioned are exclusively Rus- sian, although Bicilli is notably absent). Cudakov summarizes two basic critical positions and then rejects them. The first, associated with many con- temporary and early readings of the story, claims that all subjects touched upon in the story are seen substantially through the eyes of Egoru'ka. The second critical stance admits the presence of the author's voice, but alleges it to be hidden. To these arguments, some of which have been challenged out- side the Soviet Union,7 Cudakov offers an alternative. In his opinion, the perception and point of view of the narrator-observer are dominant, for ex-</page><page sequence="3">Cexov's The Steppe Revisited 315 ample, ". .. in the many descriptions of nature formally tied to Egoru'ka's field of vision" (114). Cudakov makes a case in his book for the primacy within the story of an assertive, interventionist narrator-observer. Yet even he admits that in many of the philosophical-contemplative nature descriptions one finds a bit (lepta) of the hero (114). He further notes several of Egoru'ka's descriptions that refer to his perception of the journey from a future perspective (presumably when an adult), indicating a subsequently changed con- sciousness. He claims that such references to a more mature Egoru'ka are still another method of taking the story beyond the realm of a child's ap- prehension of the world. If Cudakov's interpretation is to be challenged, it must be on the grounds that another explanation of the forward-looking statements concerning Egoru'ka's future perceptions is possible. Such state- ments as "Egoru'ka took everything at face value and believed every word; later on this seemed strange to him" indicate that the journey was psy- chologically significant and could have laid the foundation for a mature reflection upon it. Thus, these few moments looking ahead to Egoru'ka's adult understanding of his steppe experience may be a clue to developmental processes taking place within him during the course of the journey - processes which only later are consciously realized and dwelt upon. The range of critical opinion concerning the narrative viewpoint in The Steppe leads one to suspect a complex literary technique which most likely has its origin in one of two possibilities: either Cexov was inexperienced in the writing of longer prose works and therefore completed the story in a confused and complicated manner because he was unable to clearly define a unified narrative viewpoint; or Cexov knew very well what he was doing and in fact developed a complex set of connections between two distanced narrative viewpoints - Egoru'ka's and the narrator-observer's. Many critics have accepted the former position and thus have been unable to decide whether Egoru'ka is a passive character of little importance or whether he really does carry within his perceptions a representation of the steppe and the emblematic meaning intended by the author. Thus we find Winner proclaiming bluntly that "Egor's role is a passive one."' Later he notes, however, the story's ".... eight chapters are united by an inner action and a common atmosphere to which Egor reacts, and it is this which provides the essential unity of the story" (52). Bicilli informs us that the ". .. 'hero' does not act; he is presented, one might say, as a receiver of impressions."g Such a statement assigns an entirely static role to Egoruika. Yet it can hardly be squared with Bicilli's own observation that within The Steppe the ". .. most rigorous parallelism of the processes in the world of nature and in the world of man are brought about through a merging of 'setting' and 'action' into a single whole" (64). Egoruika must take part in such setting and action; he cannot "not act." Kramer, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="4">316 Slavic and East European Journal places Egoru'ka firmly within texov's effort to express the steppe's mean- ing when he contends that the ". . . desire to express the beauty and mystery of the steppe world lies at the center of the whole story. The story itself is such an effort, and Egoru'ka's primary role is that of a recording in- telligence upon which beauty and mystery are registered and thus ex- pressed." (89.) Egoru'ka is thus no longer passive, he no longer simply receives impressions - he is a recording intelligence. Kramer has moved properly toward a definition of Egoruska's complex role in the narrative strategies of The Steppe. The phrase "recording in- telligence" is in fact an oxymoron where "recording" implies an automatic and unreflective registering of impressions, while "intelligence" is the ability to learn and gain understanding from experience. Egoru'ka can thus be seen to both take in impressions and in the process, to grow in understanding. Such an interpretation of Kramer's phrase as it applies to the boy's role in the story hardly supports the conclusion that Egoru'ka is "passive." But it is also important to note that the impressions received by Egoru'ka do not come directly from the steppe, as Kramer seems to imply, but from the steppe as interpreted by the narrator-observer. The complex relationship be- tween two "recording intelligences" - those of the narrator-observer and Egoru'ka - is at the center in the narrative construct of The Steppe. What is important is the intertexture between and among those primary points of view. It is apparent from the beginning of the story that we are dealing with the perceptions of a nine-year-old boy. Although the story is told ostensibly from his viewpoint, he obviously does not perceive the steppe at the same level as the narrator-observer. While the story has as its major theme the meaning of the steppe (as an emblem for life, Russian experience, and so forth), it can be maintained that the awakening of Egoru'ka to its meaning is a central element within this major theme.' Egoru'ka gradually discovers the meaning of his existence, and is given scant help from his immediate preceptors. At the outset of the story Egoru'ka's father and grandmother are dead, as are most of his other relatives; his mother has abandoned him to his uncle Kuz'mi'ov, who will transport him across the steppe to new and unknown adventures. Egoru'ka is unprepared for the steppe (life), having been isolated essentially in the confines of his hometown and its limited view of experience. His is a child's world - a fairy tale universe where the dead sleep. A fairy tale, magical, and quasi-mystical element is intrinsic to The Steppe. It is introduced early and borne forward throughout the story. One major level of this thematic element is clearly the mystery of the steppe itself. A reference to the "antediluvian" cart on which the travelers ride is encoun- tered in the very first sentence, and it sets the tone for a story concerned with deep and timeless elements in the human psyche. The extensive use of</page><page sequence="5">texov's The Steppe Revisited 317 anthropomorphism is a contributing element to the thematic layer: for ex- ample, the reference to a chain of hills - "squeezing close, they looked out one after the other" (VII, 21); an unseen woman singing - "it seemed to him it was the grass that sang" (30); an ash-gray curly cloud appears above the steppe, "exchanging glances with the steppe, it said 'I'm ready,' and frowned" (34); and perhaps the most famous example, "the kitebird flew just above the ground, majestically extending its wings when suddenly it stopped in mid-air, as if it had fallen into deep thought on life's tedium" (22). Because of his youth and openness, Egoru'ka is able to contact the timeless beauty and relentless destruction central to the meaning of the steppe. Kuz mibov hnd father Xristofor are asleep to the steppe as a life process, the former wedded to his business transactions and the latter grow- ing dull and senile. Egoru'ka's traveling companions are in fact discredited early in the story in terms of their ability to help the boy understand his surroundings. He must learn directly from the steppe and other people (children, workers, and carters, for example) not associated with the limited viewpoint of the merchant class from which he derives. In the course of the journey, Egoru'ka begins to sense the steppe's meaning, which the narrator- observer's voice has been describing to the reader. This nascent perception constitutes a dramatic tension in the story as the reader begins to sense its presence and development. Certain questions arise in connection with the reader's perception of Egoru'ka: will he form a realistic judgment about his uncle and Father Xristofor? Will he develop an understanding of the steppe itself and the significance of his journey across it? These questions adumbrate an impor- tant subtext to the major narrative descriptions of the steppe's physical nature and man's spiritual and even visceral relationship to it. Thus we are dealing here with the process of an awakening self-consciousness, a process undergone by Egoru'ka. The primordial nature of the steppe is established from the very outset. In addition to recognizing it as a battlefield of survival and renewal, the narrative opens a path to a merging of the adult privileged level of narration with the character of Egoru'ka. His nature is also primitive and receptive to emotional contact with the physically sensuous. He has not yet developed the rational abilities of his elders - abilities which allow them to block out the reality of the steppe. As we progress into our reading it becomes evident that vision, perception, and other visual phenomena constitute an important element of emphasis within the story's narrative fabric. The use of verbs related to seeing and looking is so extensive as to stand out from the story's stylistic embroidery: "vzgljanul, vygljadyvali belye kresty, solnce uie vygl- janulo, Egoruika vidit, smotrit vsled, gljadel, gljadja, provoial glazami, uvidel, ogljadel, pogljadyvaj, pogljadel, on nacelilsja na odnu to~ku</page><page sequence="6">318 Slavic and East European Journal glazami, ne bylo vidno, ono peregljanulos , otkryl glaza, vidyval, zagljanul, ne otryvaja glaz. .. ." The interaction between Egoruska and the steppe is further emphasized in an early scene showing him in a mournful mood. As we move into the steppe we learn this disposition is somehow central to its mode of being. For his part, Egoru'ka experiences leaving home as a form of death, and therefore dwells on pertinent objects seen from the moving cart, such as the cemetery. He feels the process of life and death, but cannot articulate these feelings. Such an articulation is carried by the narrator- observer through a philosophical and impressionistic portrayal of the steppe. Thus the core of the story subsists in the emotions of life and death - just barely perceived on a conscious level by Egoru'ka, beautifully told with the steppe as its emblem on the part of the narrative voice. In the beginning of the second chapter Egoru'ka senses a change in the air, a cooling of the atmosphere. Soon a brook appears "joyful, sparkling in the sun," and then another stream which is being consumed by the sun and losing its strength to the sun's heat. This second stream soon flows into another to form a greater force of water. These images aptly describe the steppe and the boy in their relationship to life: they are primitive and potentially grand; both are succored and threatened by the source and energy of life - the sun. Another primitive force which fascinates Egoru'ka is provided in the form of the cart driver, Deniska. He is differentiated from the other travelers by his rank and behavior. We are made aware of his vulgarity early in the story, and later his childlike actions and energy come to the reader's attention. Deniska is not afraid of the steppe because he is a part of its es- sence. He is alternately gentle and mischievous, cruel and destructive. And it is Deniska who draws the attention of Egoru'ka. While Father Xristofor and Kuz'miov sleep, Deniska is ever active. He has no advice to give the boy, and the admonishments of Father Xristofor to study and of Kuz'miov to work as a merchant mean nothing to him. Here might be seen a certain influence of Tolstoj whereby a simple peasant is more in tune with the real workings of the world than representatives of other classes. And, again, as in Tolstoj (in Childhood, for example), a child instinctively feels the falseness of one person and the elemental profundity of another. Egoru'ka is emotionally in tune with the activities of Deniska, and his thoughts become intertwined with the mystery of the steppe: His sleepy mind completely rejected ordinary thoughts, became blurred and could contain only fantastic, fairy tale images, which was an advantage since somehow, all by themselves, without any bother to the person thinking them, they spring to mind and then at the merest shake of the head disappear again without a trace; and, to be sure, there was nothing around to dispose him to ordinary thoughts. (50.) Soon we read the following in reference to the steppe: "Everything is visible</page><page sequence="7">Cexov's The Steppe Revisited 319 through the haze, but it is difficult to discern the color and outline of ob- jects. Everything looks different from what it is. (51.) The connection between the meaning of the steppe and Egoru'ka, his developing self, is made increasingly evident throughout the course of the narration. Egoruska's developing self-consciousness, against the background of the adult, narrator-observer level of perception, must be traced carefully. Central to growth and change in Egoruika is the concept of appearance and reality. The rich trader Varlamov, of whom the steppe people speak in hushed voices mixing respect with awe, becomes associated with the fan- tasies Egoruika weaves about the world. Varlamov is grand and wonderful, full of power and mystery. Egoruika's imagination is the appearance, the fantasy he places on reality. His growth may be measured in part by the ex- tent to which he recognizes reality but retains his imagination. The figure of Varlamov presents an instance of texov's use of anticipatory retardation." Reference is made to Varlamov on at least six occasions before he appears (25, 27, 38, 49, 52, 87). He is presented to Egoruika as a feared, rich, enormously powerful idol; he is richer and even more powerful than princess Dranickaja. In reality, however, Varlamov turns out to be small, gray, old, determined, authoritarian (his businesslike mien reminds Egoruska of his uncle Kuz'mibov), confident, and has a distinctly Russian face. He rides away down a dusty road and is swallowed up into the steppe. Egoruika's imagination is fired by the steppe. Its surface beauty and mystery appeal to him as did the beauty and mystery of princess Dranickaja at the Jewish inn of Mojsej Mojseic. Just as the outward imaginative ap- pearance of Varlamov proved deceptive, so too does the outward ap- pearance of the steppe. The narrative indicates this, for example, when Egoru'ka awakens after his transfer to a new cart: "[The steppe] in its great breadth puzzled Egoruika and made him think of fairy tales. Who rides across [the steppe]? For whom is such vastness necessary?" (54.) The boy daydreams of huge chariots racing over the road, each drawn by six tremendous fiery steeds and driven by swashbuckling charioteers. This great power, these eternal figures, the unending road and vast steppe are soon seen from another perspective. To the right of the road run telegraph poles and lines, symbols of man's mundane and temporary penetration into the immutable world of the steppe: "Hawks, martins and crows were sitting on the telegraph lines; they peered down indifferently at the haycart passing below" (55). These residents of the steppe, birds of prey and omens of death (on the symbolic and folkloric levels) who indifferently view the comedy of human foibles passing below them suggest that the human reality Egoruika con- tacts is concerned importantly with the fleeting nature of man's life, with its surface manifestations and the reality underlying them.</page><page sequence="8">320 Slavic and East European Journal Egoru'ka is in fact exposed throughtout the narrative to the tender and sad existence of appearances and realities.'2 His childish imagination is in tune with the eternal, with the awakening of youth to life; at the same time he is introduced by suggestion and direct example to the limitations of human existence. He is exposed to the potential of appearances and reality, the possibilities (or lack thereof) to do something positive with the fleeting moment given to man. One indication of this is the killing of a grass snake by one of the carters, Dymov. If not examined carefully, the grass snake may have the appearance of a dangerous poisonous viper. Dymov kills the grass snake without bothering to note its markings. Dymov is described here as totally merciless, a blind enforcer of chaos. Egoruska witnesses a death of innocence in the killing of the grass snake and comes into contact in this way with the irrational forces in life. This incident is a direct example to him of the precarious nature of existence, although it is somewhat tempered by in- dications that others among the carters feel the injustice of such a senseless murder. A second example which illustrates the functions of appearance and reality in life focuses on the potential within the human condition. Vasja, another carter, has an unusual ability - incredibly sharp powers of vision. Whereas Dymov cannot see the harmlessness of a grass snake and seems to be ready to destroy anything in his path, Vasja sees beyond ugliness and ap- pearances to the beauty in life. First we encounter this description of Dymov: "his mischievous mocking glance slid along the road, the wagons and the sky without stopping anywhere, and it seemed he was searching for someone to kill, just like that, and for something to make fun of' (61). Later, when evening arrives and the carters sit around the fire, Vasja sees a fox in the dark distance. The others see nothing: "He saw so well that for him the gray forlorn steppe always swelled with life and meaning" (62). And further: "It is not given to everyone to see wild animals in their domestic life, when they are not running, hiding or looking about timorously" (62). These incidents involving appearances and reality are placed in close conjunction within the story. They serve as living illustrations to Egoruska of destructive and positive elements within the community, and, also, as dif- ferent approaches to the problem of appearances and realities in the world of nature and in human existence. The striking contrast of Dymov and Vasja is not left in an unam- biguous state. The cruel and merciless Dymov is, nevertheless, the possessor of great physical beauty and a certain gruff charm; Vasja, the penetrating, the seer of beauty, is deformed by a facial tumor and not long after the inci- dents described above is found eating a live minnow with jaunty elan. Again we are faced with appearances and realities, but this time they are in a state of flux; there is within beauty the seed of destruction, just as within cruelty and destruction there is the seed of beauty and creativity. The battlefield of</page><page sequence="9">Cexov's The Steppe Revisited 321 the steppe is here introduced at the level of the narrator-observer, and it brings Egoruika (his narrative level) to an increasing awareness of the basic questions of life. Both narrative levels act within the story as they confront the problems of loneliness, loss and death. On the narrator-observer's level: "When you gaze long into the azure sky without averting your eyes, for some reason thought and spirit merge in the consciousness of isolation. You begin to feel unalterably lonely, and everything formerly close and dear becomes endlessly far away and without value" (72). And in Egorugka's spiritual response: "Egoruika thought of his grandmother sleeping now under the cherry trees in the cemetery; he remembered how she lay in her coffin with coins on her eyes, how later the lid was closed and lowered into the grave; he even recalled the thud of earth clods striking the coffin lid. . ." (72). Egoruska's ability to respond is here dictated by his youth. He cannot react in a full contemplative and philosophical manner to life about him (this response is provided by the narrator-observer's viewpoint). But his very youth allows him to respond directly to nature and events without shutting off emotions. The dichotomy in Egoruska's perception and the distance between his and the narrator- observer's levels seem to merge at least once in The Steppe. Recall that the terrible story of Pantelej has just been recounted;'3 Egoruika and the carters are sitting at the fire eating kava: "The cross by the road, the dark bundles, the vast horizon and the fate of these people gathered by the campfire - all of this was of itself so marvelous and strange that the magic of makebelieve or fairy tale faded and seemed to merge with ordinary life" (79). Here Egoruika shares the collective feeling of wonder in nature's presence - a feeling which is superior to any tale created, like Pantelej's, by human inven- tion. Man's activity ("the dark bundles"), social order ("the cross by the road"), and spiritual potential ("the vast horizon") are joined to his fate to momentarily express life's fullness. Egoruika will retain this moment, realiz- ing in the future, we are told, that Pantelej has "depreciated his rich life" by turning to boastful stories that hide the true human richness of experience. It may be seen that a path of feeling and potential consciousness has been cleared on the higher narrative level for the growth of Egoruika. He can now bring his fantasies of fantastic worlds into a more well-rounded picture of reality. The remainder of the story (chapters VII, VIII) concerns, for the most part, the storm and the subsequent reuniting of Egoruika with Father Xristofor, Kuz'midov, and Deniska. During the downpour Egoruika is struck by his loneliness and isolation. He feels cut off from human contact and contemplates the people he has seen as "inhuman and horrible." When the original group of four come together again, Father Xristofor and the other adults are not able to comfort Egoruika in his fever-induced fears. By virtue of his experience with the carters (he has lived through a terrible</page><page sequence="10">322 Slavic and East European Journal storm and just before that had challenged and chastised the unhappy bully Dymov), Egoru'ka is not impressed by the solemn banalities of his elders. Ironically, he had been sent across the steppe to school, to learn and study, to grow into manhood. But the journey and the nature of the steppe is an ex- perience in the face of which traditional school learning inevitably pales. Egoru'ka has experienced a learning process of mind and spirit, and has grown considerably. The reader's awareness of this phenomenon has become steadily increased as he observes the gradual merging of the narrator-observer's level (contemplation of the steppe and its meaning) with the perceptions of the young travel-hero. Egoru'ka has begun to sense the grandeur of nature and the potential of human strengths and talents (the steppe, Vasja, Dymov), but he also senses sickness, destruction, and the im- placability of death everywhere about him (Emel'jan, Dymov, the storm). Thus, when he takes his leave from Father Xristofor, "something in his soul whispered to him that he would never see the old man again" (99). While it is true, as Cexov stated, that The Steppe contains many stories each with a life of its own, they revolve around the central theme of Egoru'ka's ever deepening understanding of the nature of the steppe as an emblem for existence. The embodiment of this theme in the story represents a mature experiment by Cexov in the uses of narrative voice. He develops a double narrative viewpoint dominated by the narrator-observer, who may at times seem to be the author himself, and by Egoru'ka, whose nascent per- ceptions and understandings come into dialogic relationship with the mature world view of the narrator-observer. This dialectical tension of cen- tral voices has been, for the most part, overlooked in earlier criticism on the story. In his afterword to a collection of translated stories from Cexov's mature period (1888-1903), Rufus Mathewson characterizes one of the main elements in the narrative technique of those stories as the "controlled un- derstanding voice" of the narrator.14 The Steppe is an excellent example of the way the narrator's voice speaks to a central character and evokes, within its third-person mode, a narrative response to its message. We thus find within the story a consistency of detail and suggestive imagery to which Egoru'ka and the narrator-observer react. This structural-thematic element transcends the episodic nature of the story, making of The Steppe a long tale vibrant with the drama of an awakening personality.
