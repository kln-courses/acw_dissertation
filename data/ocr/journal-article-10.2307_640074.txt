<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ojibwa Taxonomy and Percept Ambiguity MARY B. BLACK INTRODUCTION A. I. Hallowell was one of the anthropologists in America who showed an early interest in cognitive culture and what he called in 1942 "the amazingly variable belief systems of mankind." (Black 1974:519-521 places his work in this line of development.) From his teachers among the Ojibwa Indians (chiefly the Berens River Saulteaux in the 1930s)l Hallowell set out to absorb, comprehend, MARY B. BLACK is affiliated as research associate with the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and has divided her time since 1968 between that loca- tion and field residence in an Ojibwa community in Subarctic Ontario. She also has taught in California (UCLA and California State University, North- ridge), taking her Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1967 with a concentration in cognitive anthropology. Initial research and writing for this paper was carried out under predoc- toral fellowship and field grant from NIMH; constant contact with Ojibwa friends and teachers over the years since 1965 has never failed to add in- crements of learning and valued experiences; final analysis and writing was aided by research facilities of the Royal Ontario Museum including close consultation with Dr. Edward S. Rogers. i. Hallowell (1960) attributes the evidence adduced for this classification "chiefly to my own fieldwork with a branch of the Northern Ojibwa," re- ferring the reader to chapter 5 of Culture and Experience where the Saul- teaux Ojibwa of the Berens River area (east of Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba and Ontario) are described historically, geographically, and socioculturally. He felt they had retained their cultural conservatism because of relative isolation and continuation of hunting, fishing, and trapping and thus of</page><page sequence="2">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 91 and respect their particular system of interpreting and dealing with the phenomenal world. As ethnographer, he undertook to commu- nicate this understanding to his own colleagues and countrymen, always a difficult task. Hallowell's descriptive material often ap- pears as a string of annotated anecdotes from his field data, some- times illustrative of one or another current theory or special inter- est in the behavioral sciences. In his reports on Ojibwa "world view," however (especially 1960 and sections of 1951, 1954, 1958, and 1963), one can also discern an incipient systematic design, one "attitudes and beliefs about the nature of animals and man's relation to them." He states, "The persistence of hunting cannot be separated in Ojibwa culture from beliefs about the nature of the world. . . . Hunting . . . was not a secular occupation. . . . Success depended as much upon a man's satisfactory relations with the superhuman 'masters' of the different species of game and furbearing animals, as upon his technical skill. . . . These entities were among the great 'givers,' who bestowed extraordinary powers upon men, acted as their 'guardian spirits,' and without whose 'blessings' and assistance a satisfactory human life was thought to be impossible" (1955: 120). Before the Treaty of 1875, he goes on, "there were no chiefs in the modern sense, nor any juridical procedures . . .no one was responsible for punishing crime or settling disputes. The major social sanction was the fear of misfortune and disease. ... Effective leadership rested in the so-called 'medicine men,' those who were reputed to have gained the most power, through their dreams, from superhuman entities" (1955:120-121). Much of the belief complex remains "to this day" he adds, though technological change and contact with Euro-Canadian culture have accelerated rapidly in the area. In 1965 in northern Minnesota I also found the belief complex about the natural world to be largely retained and in use by the five or six elderly Indians who worked on the classifications study-though their living was only minimally by fishing and hunting at that time. (All were over 65 and had English as a second language if at all.) The belief system yielded by an analysis of the classifications had much in common with that described by Hallowell, according greatest importance to relative degree of power and to a man's relationship with those who were in a position to help or harm him (see Black 1967, 1977). This paper deals primarily with the percept aspect of the system. Individuals of both groups of Ojibwa displayed the typical tendency to speak only for themselves and of the things they had known through experience. The experience of each individual being different, and also private, they explicitly anticipated that others' accounts would differ from their own, even on factual and cognitive matters. This is what is referred to as the "Ojibwa phenomenology" in note 2 (see also Black 1973 and 1976). This tendency, coupled with beliefs about the objective reality of certain private sensory experiences, yields an expectation of individual diversity of perception-a matter pertinent to the present analysis. Even more fundamental, for an understanding of the taxonomic indeterminacy outlined in this paper, is that the whole living world is seen as potentially dangerous, its members variously and unpredictably powerful-and beneath that, that the whole world (with small exception) is seen as potentially "living." (It was suggested in Black 1967:201 that the Ojibwa word for the total domain, glossed 'living things', might be reglossed in final analysis as 'those beings with power'.)</page><page sequence="3">92 * ETHOS that consists of taxonomic classes and their defining properties- in short, a folk taxonomy. Here, Hallowell gives the "Ojibwa world view categories" within this basically ethnosemantic frame- work, although without identifying his work with that developing field or employing its more formal means for recording and analyz- ing this type of data. I believe that certain of his stated theoretical goals, and the underlying design of these ethnographic reports, re- veal him to have been, among many other things, an early ethno- scientist. In this paper I document this claim from his own writ- ings, and after presenting a formalization of his reported data offer an analysis (based on my own Minnesota Ojibwa study of 1965- see note 1) that accounts for certain aspects of the Ojibwa classifica- tions. HALLOWELL'S ETHNOSCIENCE: THEORY AND APPLICATION THEORETICAL GOALS By 1940, and consistently thereafter, Hallowell sought means for describing a culture in terms of its cognitive organization of ex- perience. His theoretical position regarding the aims of ethnogra- phy was very close to that of the ethnoscience or ethnosemantic development of the 1950s and 1960s. Selected passages from his writings published between 1940 and 1963 (see Appendix 1, be- low) document his conviction that the ethnographer should strive for an "inside view" of a people's phenomenal world, their "blue- print for a meaningful interpretation of objects and events," which affects their perception of the physical environment and thereupon their "concepts, discriminations, and classificatory pat- terns." By 1960 he was presenting Ojibwa culture as a particular "cognitive orientation in a cosmos" and he labeled it an "ethno- metaphysics." But back in 1940 he had written, "Whereas we might attribute such inevitable hazards of life as illness, misfortune or death to chance ... the [Ojibwa] individual [does not] ... because of the character and limits of the explanation of phenomena his culture offers him as alternatives" (italics mine). It seems clear that from the start he considered one task of ethnography to be the discovering and reporting of a culture's cognitive "alternatives," their "character and limits." Thus the importance of the basic ingredient, ontology (an in- ventory of the things people perceive to exist in the world) as a</page><page sequence="4">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 93 starting point for a cultural description. In his description, "it is necessary to avoid, as far as possible, the imposition of categories of thought, classifications of phenomena, and terminology . . . [of] Western culture," Hallowell appears here to have solved the phenomenological dilemma in a manner similar to the ethnosci- entists: he avoided imposing Western categories ("as far as possi- ble") by imposing the structure of taxonomic categorization that his Western preconceptions assumed to be universal. The Ojibwa's own phenomenology (more advanced than in Western society) is, indeed, one of the elements that played havoc with the taxonomic results, as will be seen.2 APPLICATION: HALLOWELL'S OJIBWA FOLK TAXONOMY (See note I for cultural notes and belief system summary.) In the papers cited, Hallowell's cognitive ethnography of the Ojibwa has a folk taxonomic framework; he provides the hierarchy of categor- ies in which Ojibwa has a folk taxonomic framework; he provides the hierarchy of categories in which Ojibwa people perceive some portion of the physical world (in this instance, all "living things"), and the attributes or properties by which they define these cate- gories and distinguish one from another. Though the material is presented in a deceptively anecdotal manner, it is possible for the reader to extract and reorder the relevant information, and to chart formally the structure of the whole. This is what I have done. The classes are charted in tables 1 and 2. Where the taxonomy appears incomplete, please note that there is no missing category across any important level of contrast. Membership in some categories is ob- 2. The phenomenological dilemma of attempting to look at phenomena: without prejudging, without applying one's own categorizations or precon- ceptions, seems to have been recognized by Hallowell as the logical im- possibility that it is. (His argument was, after all, that the Ojibwa, like all people, perceive the world through their cultural preconceptions.) And al- though at first glance his papers sometimes read like extended field notes, he ultimately did not rely on the Ojibwa people's words and acts "speaking for themselves" to readers (who would of course "hear" through their own concepts, categories, and preconceptions). He resembled the ethnoscientist in his going directly after the Ojibwa categories and ways of ordering the phenomena of their world-within a Western taxonomic structure. The requirement for some kind of order seems indeed a human universal, as does that for generic inclusion classes in human languages. That the Ojibwa data, and response to "taxonomizing," did not exactly fit Western rules seems partly because of their accrediting only "that which is revealed through [their own] experience"--a definition of phenomenology given by MacLeod (1951: 227).</page><page sequence="5">94 * ETHOS TABLE 1 WORLD VIEW CAICGORLS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN OJIBWA SOCETY (from Hallowel 1954, 1958, 1960, 1963) Objects Self Objects other than self Living things Nonliving things Persons Animals Plants Material Other.- objects. than.

But that is the point: the relationship of those members to all other parts of the system will be known, once they are added. The description is thus ex- pandable, as well as replicable and testable. The completeness is in fact rather remarkable, considering that Hallowell did not draw up the structure in one place as is done here.3 Table 2 provides detail for the center portion of table 1, with "living things" as the head term. 3. It is interesting that Professor Hallowell's widow, Maude Hallowell, now reports that "he was addicted to diagrams and charts" as an aid in think- ing and teaching, but he did not use them in his published work.</page><page sequence="6">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 95 Supporting evidence for these chartings, cited directly from Hallowell's text, is systematized in appendixes 2 and 3. Appendix 2 gives his references to "classes" or "categories" with remarks in- dicating their inclusion and contrast relations; appendix 3 gives the "attributes" or properties that characterize each class. His words speak for themselves as evidence that he viewed the Ojibwa categories within a framework of what we would call semantic structuring. The class that Hallowell calls "persons" is of special interest because of its structural position in his analysis, as well as its im- portance in his interpretation of Ojibwa world view. He states, "In this paper I have assembled evidence . .. which supports the inference that . . . the action of persons provides the major key to their world view" (1960:50). "Persons" turns out to be what ethnoscientists would term a "covert category" (Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven 1968), for according to Hallowell the Ojibwa do not recognize this class as such, but the belief system structure is more truly represented by inferring it from his data. He has stated, "It is not necessary that the individual be aware of the underlying ... principles involved, any more than it is necessary that he be aware of the grammatical principles of the language that he speaks. But the former are as open to investigation as are the latter" (1955:91). In the table of properties, then, appear several of what are termed "person attributes" that define this class as contrasted with other classes at the same level. Hallowell appropriately extended the taxonomic universe to all "living things" (table 2) so the con- trasting categories are provided. In fact, he initially extended it to all objects of the individual's cognitive orientation, including self, thus placing "persons" within the total ontological world of the individual (table 1). Note that each class has been subdivided only within the categories relevant to the "persons" argument. So the tables show how the "persons" entities relate to the members of other categories, although all such members are not given. Hallowell's need for the "persons" class could be explained struc- turally as follows: In table 2 the "other-than-human" subclass of "persons" includes various spiritual beings and mythological char- acters, and elements such as sun and moon and winds. These are all entities that would ordinarily be labeled "supernaturals." But Hallowell did not find a natural/supernatural dichotomy in Ojibwa world view. One of his continuing arguments was that the Ojibwa</page><page sequence="7">96 * ETHOS do not necessarily share our Western dichotomies of natural and supernatural, human and other-than-human, dreams and waking experience-dichotomies that we sometimes mistakenly extend to our ethnographic descriptions. If the Ojibwa recognize a class of beings who are not "human beings" but are closer to human beings than to other classes of the animate world, this calls for the union of the "human beings" class and the entities who are close to human beings. Hallowell therefore introduced a superordinate class "persons," allowing this unlabeled group of entities to be simply "other-than-human persons," that is, all members of the "person" class that are not "human beings." This makes complete sense, taxonomically, with the inferred category validated by its presumed possession of common attributes that distinguish it from other classes of "living things." (Black 1969a validates an un- labeled category in similar manner. My analysis, however, did not support the introduction of a class such as Hallowell's "persons.") Thus we see how far Hallowell went in following the structural requisites of ethnoscience, albeit embedded and almost disguised in his reports and lacking methodological specification. He did not carry it further than this, nor did he present it in a format that would allow a critical inspection and analysis such as we can now extend. ANALYSIS OF OJIBWA FOLK TAXONOMY, 1965 Portions of my formal semantic study of Ojibwa classifications (Black 1967), carried out in 1965 in northern Minnesota, coincide with Hallowell's embedded taxonomy outlined above. Especially, results of the 1965 elicitation of taxonomic categories show a simi- larity that is notable (though not total), probably attesting to a basic constancy of cognitive culture among Ojibwa Indians across geographical areas, and to the genuineness and conscientiousness of our Ojibwa teachers. (See note 1 regarding the two Ojibwa groups.) Therefore, it is now possible to apply to both sets of data an analysis of certain inconsistencies in Ojibwa taxonomizing, taking up the data as they stand at the stage of description where Hallowell left them. (The Minnesota work can even be considered as a replication and extension of Hallowell's ethnography, given the latter's folk classification structure.) Critical examination of Hallowell's own statements within their systematized framework (and adding related material from the extended Minnesota study)</page><page sequence="8">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 97 yields the discovery of a particular type of indeterminacy present in the taxonomies. I propose that this indeterminacy may be in- herent in the Ojibwa belief system or world view. The following critique was originally applied to the Minnesota results only (see Black 1967:492-200, and other page numbers below). A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE OJIBWA CATEGORIES AND PROPERTIES Had Hallowell pursued the implications of his reported world view categories and their defining properties, he would have found an instability not altogether becoming a proper taxonomy. (He would no doubt, however, have penetrated through to the real "truth" in his Ojibwa lessons, rather than label his teachers dis- orderly.) The careful reader now is able, from a close inspection of the classes and the statements about their properties, to draw his own conclusions. Offered here are some ideas and guidelines from another longtime pupil of Ojibwa teachers. The clues disclosing taxonomic instability and ultimate indeter- minacy that in turn is rooted in Ojibwa cognitive culture are to be found in tables 1 and 2 and appendixes 2 and 3. We should expect that classes in table 2 would exhibit more or less mutually exclu- sive membership, in a reasonably stable manner from one moment to the next, with substantial though not necessarily total agreement among culture members.4 And we should expect that appendix 3's attributes would "unify" within classes and distinguish definitively or contrastively between those classes that occur at the same tax- onomic level. The data show that violations occur on both scores -especially surrounding the "persons" category and its subdivi- sions. For example, category t.7 in table 2 ("other-than-human persons") includes "some stones," "some animals," ''some trees." For appendix 2 documentation, see under "t.3, t.4, t.5 (included in t.l)," "t.10, t.ll (included in t.5)," and "t.14 through t.32 (in- cluded in t.7)." These are entities whose original homes are in classes that are supposed to contrast with "persons." (One wants to know, of course, which stones, which animals, etc., but the case is not so simple. The Minnesota data, especially, stressed that these are also sometimes in the t.7 class, giving them a sort of "visitor" 4. This allows for shifts owing to change of context (for example when classifying the same items for purposes other than generic class position), and for category-fringe variability among individuals. See Black 1976 for dis- cussion of intracultural semantic variability.</page><page sequence="9">98 * ETHOS status and the class a shifting membership. And more complexities arise, as will be seen. See Black 1967:104-106, fig. 4.C, where category t.9 corresponds to Hallowell's t.7.) Thus there is overlapping membership in classes that should contrast, and also a sort of movement in and out. On this fact all informants agree, though they do not share the exact inventory of entities who are visitors versus those who are hosts. Table 2 shows also three members of t.7 (other-than-human persons) with Ojibwa language labels: dtiso'kanak, pawdganak, manitu. While there are slight differences conceptually, each of these terms can, at times, refer to the whole class. Appendix 2 entries under "t.12, t.13 (in- cluded in t.6)" and "t.14, t.15, t.16, (included in or standing for t.7)" document this from Hallowell's writings. Thus the three terms are partial synonyms, referentially. Referential synonyms should not occupy separate quarters in a proper taxonomy. It also emerges that any of the living entities (except people) may con- ceivably or potentially be a member of this category-and even some humans cross over for periods of time or straddle the line. And finally, it is said that there are members of this class who are there only for some individual Indian (and likely only he would know of it, as these are the spirits who choose to appear privately to individuals and give them blessings). Thus the class is actually constituted differently for each individual, though there is a core on which all would agree, and it is constituted differently at each moment in time. (Some of these unstable facts are not reflected in table 2; Black's fig. 4.C mentioned above does, however, take them into account; and text 4.222(2) discusses all types of instability in some detail: Black 1967:112, 115-116.) Appendix 3's citations about defining properties support most of these violations, and especially show "person attributes" distributed widely and seemingly capriciously here and there throughout the range of "living things," infiltrating as far as the "plant" category and even that of "material objects." Now this is surely a strange kind of disorder to be tolerated by a scholar like Hallowell, and even stranger for the Ojibwa people themselves, who presumably-no matter how respectful of one another's differences-exist on the basis of some kind of cognitive organization and concensus (including concensus about comple- mentarity, if you will). The instabilities just summarized all seem to occur owing to inclusion in the taxonomy of the "other-than-</page><page sequence="10">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 99 human persons," and to the inference of the "persons" class. Yet, as Hallowell frequently insisted, the Ojibwa do include and classify these entities right along with all the less "imaginary" creatures in their environment (Hallowell 1951:179). The crux seems to be that they also clothe them in certain types of defining properties that are in essence logically and empirically antitaxonomic. The instability is built into the system by the stated qualifications for membership in this class. The solution that is now offered for consideration focuses attention on two aspects: (1) the type of attributes that the Ojibwa teachers thought most important for defining the classes; and (2) that part of the folk taxonomy that is usually seen as the very base or starting point-namely, the iden- tification of perceived phenomena. Goodenough (1963:chap. 7) dissected "belief systems" in such a way that their rootings in the physical world consisted of percepts and percept categories-our sense perception of phenomena and events. Immediately upon perception of an event, human beings categorize it in accordance with their assumptions about the nature of the universe, and then they behave accordingly. In effect, we may not "see" the same phenomena, though we are observing "the same" event. If Hallowell was particularly sensitive to "cultural factors in the structuralization of perception" (1951), it may result partly from his Ojibwa experience. For to make sense of much of their behavior, one must come to know the categories of objects and events they are "seeing" at a given moment (plus the possible events judged to be not present, as Hallowell provided in his in- ventory of Ojibwa ontology). While this must be true in general, and not just of the Ojibwa, there are special factors in the Ojibwa system that make a difference; these have to do with concepts about perceptions and with ambiguity in percept identification. Returning to appendix 3, the "properties that distinguish per- sons from other living things" contain passages that reveal an Ojibwa preoccupation with appearance, form, and perceptibility itself, especially those citations summarized under the headings HUMAN ATTRIBUTES BUT NOT NECESSARILY HUMAN FORM . . . UN- STABLE OUTWARD APPEARANCE, CONSTANT INNER ESSENCE . . . CA- PACITY FOR METAMORPHOSIS . . . and DEGREE OF POWER (e.g. to appear or manifest oneself in chosen forms). All citations under these headings should be consulted; one, for example, from 1960:65: "Outward appearance is only an incidental attribute of</page><page sequence="11">100 * ETHOS being.... In outward manifestation neither animal nor human characteristics define categorical differences"; and two from other sections of the appendixes-from 1955:98: Memengwdecwak are not "perceptually intangible beings" but can be seen, and from 1955:177: the Ojibwa "take for granted that multiform appearance is an inherent potential of all animate beings. What is uniform, con- stant, visually imperceptible and vital is the soul. A sorcerer being a person of unusual power is able to leave his human body in one place and appear in another perceptible manifestation elsewhere." It is proposed that Hallowell's data items from this section of the appendixes 2 and 3 contain information for understanding the instability of the taxonomic categories as shown in table 2. They center on the operations of defining what one sees or otherwise senses at any given moment-that is, on physically identifying and categorizing the entities one is encountering. By focusing on the format of "classes and properties" that Hallowell's writings reveal, the results (like those from Minnesota) point to a particular facet of Ojibwa cognitive orientation that, by its very resistance to our ways of thinking and classifying, unveils something of its nature. Perhaps the taxonomic "failure" can now be turned into ethno- graphic learning. PERCEPT AMBIGUITY, OJIBWA-STYLE As mentioned above, at the percept level people "see" (or hear, smell, etc.) different things, depending partly on the concept struc- ture of their belief systems. Goodenough (1963:155) defined per- ception as "the decision as to what is there" when one's senses en- counter an event. The making of this decision determines (reveals) the percept category; thus we are already classifying, the moment we name or otherwise decide about "what is there." This is basic to classic ethnoscience studies, particularly those of folk biology, which focus on minimal defining features that yield physical or ostensive identification of specimens as members of denotative classes-those qualities by which we "would know one if we saw one." The Ojibwa taxonomy, when it comes to physical identification features, not only demonstrates the inseparability of percept deci- sions and cultural concepts, but it was rendered disorderly by some peculiarly indigenous ideas-ideas about the unreliability of ap-</page><page sequence="12">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 101 pearances and the power to control them. Its very indeterminacy brought to our attention the type of attributes that were salient in its construction. That is, the results show that our teachers were classifying on the basis of such attributes as the ability to change form, the power to appear to someone in a dream or vision, the ability to cause things to happen from a distance, or to control weather events or illness events or life and death. These are im- portant discriminators throughout the domain of living things- (and they add up to an assessment of relative power; see Black 1977). They are not, however, immediately perceivable attributes, in most instances, and that should be kept in mind. Let us assume that it is a legitimate indeterminacy. Note that there is stability in the class concepts themselves. The defining properties are consistent-it is the membership that shifts-by fiat, as it were. For the distribution of some of these properties is not only variable among living things, it is capable of constant reallocation among them. That is one of the basic tenets of the belief system, and to force the entities into a rigid mold would violate that system. Consequently one never knows in advance the current power-balance situation. In fact, the outcome of the present encounter may be expected to reveal or to alter it, when known. For, although there is general agreement about a core of entities that are most likely to have great power, there is always the possibil- ilty that a seemingly powerless one may at some time exert the very ability to perform some special good or harm. This is dogma, and leads back to the other dogma, the unreliability of outward ap- pearance or of "face-value" interpretation of sense data. The indigenous ideas that play havoc with Ojibwa taxonomizing start right at the percept level of the belief structure. (They seem almost capriciously and knowingly to confuse the perceptual and conceptual.) Concrete physical objects are perceived, in everyday experience, in terms of characteristics that define them as unstable, changing, and inconsistent. The belief system allows the expecta- tion that different individuals will "see" different objects in the same landscape, will "hear" different sounds; it also allows the expectation that the same entity may appear in different forms from one time to another; and it respects the individual's privacy and veracity as to what he has seen or heard and as to which of the entities has appeared to his senses alone and is thus in a certain</page><page sequence="13">102 * ETHOS class for him. The Ojibwa way of dealing with perception and of defining what they perceive has put our neat systematics in a shambles. What about those qualities by which we would know one if we saw one-the physical identification features for percept decisions? It is true that the attributes reported do not tell what a "bear" looks like, or a "man" (or better, what a bear should look like-it is the "ideal form" of bear and man that is not reported here and admittedly has to be assumed).5 They do tell important informa- tion about bears and men, though, in their classificatory relation- ship with other creatures, and it is information that also impinges upon knowing one if we saw one. In the case of bears, it might be expected that we would know (the proper form of) one upon encounter. In the case of memeng- wesiwak, however, there is no counterpart experience for non- members of the culture. It appears that to identify an encounter with a memengwesi one should know that they are generally smaller than men (not always), they have hair all over (in some versions), snub noses (or no nose), and they paddle strange canoes on the lake (especially in the mist). But, would this help, if these creatures are able to change form? It seems one should know the distribution of that power before depending on physical identifica- tion features to "decide what is there." If memengwesiwak have this attribute, their hairiness is not criterial for identification. Bears may be able to change form. Or turtles. One really ought to know. How then does an Indian know that he has encountered a memengwesi? Well, if fish are missing from his net, he can be pretty sure he has encountered a memengwesi. That is as much of an encounter as most people have, these days, except sometimes maybe to glimpse them paddling through the mist. Of course, "someone else might have been blessed by them, and they would know more about that" it might be said. (But even in the "blessing" scene, while fasting or dreaming, the signs by which the faster 5. A technical consideration of taxonomic levels was not deemed necessary in this paper. The identification criteria that are not reported here are those for classes at the most specific level of the taxonomy (bears vs. wolves, memengweciwak vs. windigo, etc.). These criteria are not without ethnogra- phic interest and would of course be included in a complete folk taxonomy. For present purposes, our focus on characteristics of phenomena as members of middle-level classes happens to reveal some pervasive cultural concepts that are relevant to Hallowell's world view description.</page><page sequence="14">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 103 knows that he has had a visitor are nearly always something other than its full materialization in a standard ideal form.) What then are the rules for recognizing encountered phenomena and assigning them class membership? If some ghosts have ap- peared in the form of birds, and some birds appear in the form of people, and some people can appear in the form of bears, and no one has really described the form of a windigo (they are most often heard or felt, not seen)-how does a man validate the essence of what he has encountered? The rule that seems to emerge from many accounts of such ex- periences might be termed a "consequences validation." He knows he has encountered a Thunderbird not by its form, which is con- stantly changing, but by what happened afterward: a pelican killed and hung in a tree out at the Narrows was known to have been a Thunderbird when a big storm followed, as a consequence. The proof it was a windigo old N grappled with last winter (he never did see it, but people heard the fighting) is that old N died this spring, and windigo victims usually die the following spring. It was not an ordinary bear that K saw five nights ago, but the medi- cine man Giwedon; this is now confirmed since K fell ill the follow- ing morning and died today. These examples all contain a con- stant and curious feature of the rule for validating one's decision as to what is there: it seems we should have asked not only "how does the Indian decide what it is he encountered?" but also "when does he decide?" For the essence (the only stable aspect) of the objects one is encountering at a given moment is often not expected to be known until some later moment-sometimes after a consider- able period of time. It is quite satisfactory, and the better part of caution, to leave the matter ambiguous until then. (During the period of percept ambiguity one must take care, of course, that one's actions do not offend any of the identification possibilities that arise to mind in the present context-or even that may arise in some future unknown context. The tolerance for withholding categorization of others has its toll-as was nicely shown some years ago by Erving Goffman [1963].) This Ojibwa tolerance for ambi- guity, and the use of such ambiguity in social relations, as sug- gested parenthetically above, is an interesting feature of the culture that deserves more specific study. (For another facet of it, see Black 1973.) It can now be seen that the type of defining property previously</page><page sequence="15">104 * ETHOS pointed out from appendix 3 and described as "antitaxonomic," is distinctive in containing a "wait-and-see" component, especially when placed in an action context-a context that Hallowell stressed and that Ojibwa people habitually insist on. Their prag- matic, after-the-fact manner of identifying class membership is part of this vein, and should have a place in the Ojibwa cognitive eth- nography. Hallowell's anecdotes illustrate it often enough. But how to deal with it formally? That it enters into the instability of elicited taxonomic classes is demonstrated. Whether it can substi- tute for denotative percept-category criteria may be open to ques- tion, but at least the attributes that users must know for identifica- tion purposes include concepts about percepts, as well as percep- tual distinctions themselves. The attempt at a folk taxonomy of "world view" proportion did teach us something nontrivial about Ojibwa cognitive-subjective culture. CONCLUDING REMARKS Professor Hallowell would probably concur in these ideas about Ojibwa percept decisions. In 1951 he wrote of the influence of cul- tural factors on variability in perception, giving Ojibwa examples of "the perceptual resolution of ambiguous stimuli." In these cases, percept decisions, based on beliefs, called for immediate ac- tion. He did not, however, refer to the other type of Ojibwa per- ceptual resolution where prolonged ambiguity of identification is what the "action" calls for. I am convinced that in a comprehensive cognitive ethnography, Ojibwa use of ambiguity would occupy an important and an integrative position. Hallowell's ethnographic writings over the years took many forms, and displayed in all a deep appreciation of Ojibwa culture. If his steps toward a folk taxonomy show that form to have been an awkard vehicle for these particular data, I have tried to show how it can also precipitate a journey in learning. APPENDIXES: PASSAGES CITED FROM HALLOWELL, 1940-1963 APPENDIX 1. STATEMENTS OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THEORY 1940: (1955:282). The type of knowledge accessible to the Saulteaux is primarily a function of their culturally constituted attitudes towards the nature of the phenomenal world. It is impossible for them to think in terms of our category of causation.. Whereas we might attribute</page><page sequence="16">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 105 such inevitable hazards of life as illness, misfortune or death to chance .. the individual in Saulteaux society does not . .. because of the character and limits of the explanation of phenomena his culture offers him as alternatives. 1942: (1, 5, 6). Human beings live in a meaningful universe, not in a world of bare physical objects and events. These meanings . . . are derived from the amazingly variable belief systems of mankind. ... The world is always perceived and derives its meaning and significance from the beliefs and presuppositions of a particular culture. the geographical locale of these Indians is on the Berens River in a subarctic physical environment ... (but) their native belief system ... defines the environment in which they live, and no purely objective account . . . would be sufficient to account for their behavior in rela- tion to this physical environment. Thunder Birds and monster snakes ... are important items in the be- havioral environment of these Indians. Since from our point of view thunder is part of their physical environment and monster snakes are not, we might be inclined to make a distinction between them. But if we do this we are making our categories a point of departure. 1954: (1955:79-80, 84, 88, 91). What I wish to develop is a frame of reference by means of which it may be possible to view the individual in another society in terms of the psychological perspective which his culture constitutes for him . . . rather than to content ourselves with the perspective of an outside observer who may even pride himself on his "objectivity." . . . The concept of behavioral environment enables us to ... approximate more closely to an "inside" view of a culture. The world of human awareness is mediated by various symbolic devices which... establish the concepts, discriminations, classificatory patterns, and attitudes. ... In this way assumptions about the nature of the universe become, as it were, a priori constituents in the perceptual process itself. [A] function of all cultures is the orientation of the self to a diversified world of objects in its behavioral environment, discriminated, classified, and conceptualized with respect to attributes which are culturally con- stituted. Object orientation ... provides the ground for an intelligible interpretation of events... on the basis of traditional assumptions re- garding the nature and attributes of the objects involved.... It is not necessary, of course, that the individual be aware of the underlying . . .</page><page sequence="17">106 ? ETHOS principles involved, any more than it is necessary that he be aware of the grammatical principles of the language that he speaks. But the former are as open to investigation as are the latter. 1960: (50, 51). Human beings in whatever culture are provided with cognitive orientation in a cosmos; there is "order" and "reason" rather than chaos.... If we pursue the problem deeply enough we soon come face to face with a relatively unexplored territory-ethnometaphysics. Can we penetrate this realm in other cultures? What kind of evidence is at our disposal?,. . . And what order of reliability can our inferences have? The problem is a complex one but this should not preclude its exploration. a thoroughgoing "objective" approach to the study of cultures cannot be achieved solely by projecting upon those cultures categorical abstrac- tions derived from Western thought.... A higher order of objectivity may be sought by adopting a perspective which includes an analysis of the outlook of the people themselves. 1963: (258, 266). All cultures provide a cognitive orientation toward a world in which man is compelled to act. A culturally constituted world view ... by means of beliefs, available knowledge and language, mediates personal adjustment to the world through such psychological processes as perceiving, recognizing, conceiving, judging and reasoning. It is a blueprint for a meaningful interpretation of objects and events. "World view"... involves a different perspective than the one assumed when we look at culture and behavior from the outside. ... It is necessary to avoid, as far as possible, the imposition of categories of thought, classifications of phenomena, and terminology . . . closely as- sociated with... Western culture. APPENDIX 2: TAXONOMIC CLASSES PASSAGES FROM HALLOWELL INDICATING CLASS INCLUSION/EXCLUSION RELATIONS OF OJIBWA WORLD VIEW PHENOMENA t.1 Living things (sometimes referred to as animate beings) 1963:268. While the Ojibwa recognize a category of living things, the classes of objects which fall into this category do not all fit out categorization.</page><page sequence="18">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY t 107 t.2 Persons (included in t.l) 1963:268. One particular class of animate, living beings-persons- is of paramount importance in the Ojibwa world view, . . . 1960:51 (and 1958:63). In all cultures "persons" comprise one of the major subclasses of objects to which the self must become oriented. t.3 Animals, t.4 plants, t.5 material objects (included in t.l) 1960:60. Persons may be set off . . . from animate beings such as ordinary animals . . . and objects belonging to the inanimate gram- matical category. 1963:271. The persons of the Ojibwa universe do not include animals and plants, as such . . . [with] possible exceptions. 1960:54. The kind of vital functions attributed to them in the belief system . . . accounts for the fact that what we view as material, in- animate objects-such as shells and stones-are placed in an "ani- mate" category along with "persons." NOTE: Hallowell's rather questionable use of noun gender as evi- dence for t.l and t.7 indicates a category such as t.5. See Black 1967, note 3 on page 165, and appendix A.4, for discussion of use of linguistic evidence (latter somewhat revised for Black 1969b). 1958:65 (also 1960:54-55). I once said to an old man: "Are all the stones we see about us here alive?" He reflected a long while and then replied, "Nol but some are." . . . the Ojibwa recognize, a priori, potentialities for animation in certain classes of objects under certain circumstances. t.6 Human beings (included in t.2) 1963:272. Human beings (anishandbek) i.e. Ojibwa Indians, are only one class of persons. t.7 Other-than-human persons (included in t.2) 1963:272. The other class of persons, I believe, it is preferable to characterize as "other-than-human beings," rather than supernatural beings, ... 1960:51. This category of being [persons] is by no means limited to human beings . . "persons" as a class include entities other than human beings. 1963:274. The Ojibwa world then is populated with persons, human</page><page sequence="19">o18 ETHOS ,and other-than-human, who occupy it along with plants, animals and inanimate objects. t.8 Bears (included in t.3), t.9 trees (included in t.4) (See citations under PERSON ATTRIBUTES in appendix 3) 1960:66. Interaction of the Ojibwa with certain kinds of plants and animals . . .as if they were dealing with "persons." t.10 Some stones, t.l1 shells (included in t.5) 1960:55. It is asserted ... that stones have been seen to move, that some stones manifest other animate properties... Associated with the Midewiwin in the past there were other types of large boulders with animate properties. 1960:54. The shells . . called migis, on account of the manner in which they function in the Midewiwin, could not be ... categorized as "inanimate." t.12 Living people, t.13 ghosts or deceased Indians (included in t.6) 1955:178. In addition to living Indians and deceased Indians, there are other classes of animate beings in the behavioral environment. 1955:180. The dead, however, have more power than the living; con- sequently they are more like pawdganak [t.7] .. but the pawdganak do not die; they never become djibaiak [ghosts]. 1955:180. [In] the conjuring tent ... the souls of djibaiak may be present and speak ... While . .. it is a soul that is present . . . it is always an identifiable self-pawdganak or ghost-that speaks. NOTE: Pawdganak in the 1955 citations is used to refer to the entire category t.7. t.14 dtiso'kanak, t.15 manitu, t.16 pawdganak (synonyms, included in or standing for the category t.7; see t.14 through t.32 below) 1960:74 (also see 1963:282). The term manitu ... may be considered as a synonym for a person of the other-than-human class . . . [also] itiso'kan, pawdgan. t.14 through t.32 (included in t.7) 1963:272. This second class of persons includes the four Winds, Sun and Moon, Thunderbirds, the "owners" or "masters" of the various species of plants and animals, and the characters in myths (atisokdnak). 1960:58. The sun is a "person" of the other-than-human class . . .</page><page sequence="20">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 109 [also] Tcakabec, a mythical personage. 1960:60. The conceptual reification of Flint, the Winds and the Sun as other-than-human persons exemplifies a world view in which a natural-supernatural dichotomy has no place.... The High God of the Ojibwa... is spoken of as a "person" . . . [and] Wisekedjak and Tcakabec ... extremely prominent characters in the myths. 1960:65. Mikindk, the Great Turtle, marries a human being. 1960:55. If, then, stones... in particular cases, have been observed to manifest animate properties ... why should they not on occasion be conceived as possessing animate properties of a "higher" order? 1960:52. Another... clue to the inclusiveness of the "person" cate- gory in Ojibwa thinking is the... windigo. 1955:98. MemengwecZwak are not human beings ... nor are they "spiritual" entities in the sense of being perceptually intangible beings.... From the Ojibwa point of view they are inhabitants of the same terrestial region as men and belong to the same class of perceptually apprehensible objects as a moose, a tree, or a man. And, like them, they may be "perceived" in dreams as well as in ordinary daily life.... These beings reputedly have been seen or heard sing- ing in ordinary life by a number of Indians ... it is necessary to receive a blessing from memengweciwak in a dream first .. . [to] obtain the special kind of medicine [these beings] are famous for. APPENDIX 3. CLASS PRO,PERTIES PASSAGES FROM HALLOWELL REGARDING CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE SOMETHING AS A MEMBER OF A MORE GENERAL CATEGORY, AND THOSE THAT SET IT OFF FROM ITS CO-MEMBERS. t.1 Living things (also called "animate beings") PROPERTIES THAT DISTINGUISH LIVING THINGS FROM NONLIVING THINGS: ANIMATENESS 1963:268. One particular class of animate, living beings. NOTE: Nonliving qualities or categories are not described, for contrast, but are implied or assumed. MOVEMENT 1960:55. It is asserted by informants that stones (presumed have been seen to move, that some stones mani- voluntary) fest other animate properties.</page><page sequence="21">110 * ETHOS 1960:55. There were other types of large bould- ers with animate properties. My friend ... had one of these, but it no longer possessed these at- tributes. It had contours that suggested eyes and mouth... he used to tap this stone ... it would then open its mouth. 1960:55. Stones ... have been observed to mani- fest animate properties, such as movement in space and opening of a mouth. DUALITY OF 1955:174. Djibaiak like dnicindbek have souls, SOUL AND FORM and some kind of form.... This duality holds for all orders of animate beings. 1955:177. Multiform appearance is an inherent potential of all animate beings. What is uniform, constant, visually imperceptible and vital is the soul. A sorcerer being a person of unusual power is able to leave his human body in one place and appear in another perceptible manifestation elsewhere. POWER 1960:69. The power hierarchy of animate being. ... Power manifestations vary within the animate class of being ... The notion of animate being itself does not presume a capacity for manifesting the highest level of power . . . in every case. 1958:76. At the lower level [of power] the ordi- nary human being and the ordinary animal are in the same class. . . . There are many degrees of power. A mole is not in the same class with a bear. PERSON 1960:66. Interaction of the Ojibwa with certain ATTRIBUTES kinds of plants and animals ... as if they were dealing with "persons." 1958:73. Whether it was the specific trees that were being addressed or their spiritual "owner," conceived as a person, involves a point of refine- ment that it is unnecessary to go into here. The</page><page sequence="22">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 111 main point is that human beings are described as in direct "social" interaction with other persons, not "things." 1958:73-74. So far as animals are concerned, when bears were sought out in their dens in the spring, they were addressed, asked to come out so that they could be killed, and an apology of- fered because this was necessary.... Bears, then, are assumed to possess "person attributes." 1958:83. "Person-objects" are not necessarily limited to the human class in the cognitive ori- entation of all peoples and .. . animals and even inanimate objects may possess person attributes. t.2 Persons (vs. t.3 animals, t.4 plants, t.5 material objects) PROPERTIES THAT DISTINGUISH PERSONS FROM OTHER LIVING THINGS: 1960:60. What constant attributes do unify the concept of "person?" 1958:68. [The question arises] whether all enti- ties of the "person" category are conceptually unified by human attributes in form and be- havior and in this way set off from animals or inanimate objects. . . . What is the essence of the Oji,bwa . . . concept of person? HUMAN 1958:66. Whether human or animal in form or ATTRIBUTES, name, they behave like people, so that ... they BUT NOT appear to belong in the category of "persons." NECESSARILY 1960:61-63. In the universe of the Ojibwa, HUMAN FORM Thunder Birds are "persons." . . . The Thunder Birds are conceived to act like human beings. 1960:64. Appearance cannot then be taken as a permanent and distinguishable trait of the Thunder Birds . . . the human attributes with which they are endowed transcend a human outward form ... in the universe of the Ojibwa the conception of a "person" as a living, func- tioning social being ... transcends a human ap-</page><page sequence="23">1-12 * ETHOS STRUCTURE: UNSTABLE OUTWARD APPEARANCE, CONSTANT INNER ESSENCE METAMORPHOSIS pearance as a constant attribute of this category of being. 1958:69 (and 1960:61). Anthropomorphism is not a constant feature of the Ojibwa concept of per- son.... Pawdganak ... are "persons"; whether they have anthropomorphic attributes or not is incidental. Other entities of the person category, whose anthropomorphic character is undefined or ambiguous, are .. . the "masters" of animal or plant species. . . . Thunder Birds are "per- sons." ... [They assume] the character of a liv- ing image which is neither the personification of a natural phenomenon nor an altogether animal or human-like being. 1960:72. We must conclude that all animate be- ings of the person class are unified conceptually in Ojibwa thinking because they have a similar structure-an inner vital part that is enduring and an outward form which can change. 1960:65. Outward appearance is only an inciden- tal attribute of being.... In outward manifesta- tion neither animal nor human characteristics define categorical differences. 1955:179. In the behavioral world of the Ojibwa, no sharp line can be drawn between animals, pawdganak [t.7], men, or the spirits of the dead on the basis of outward bodily aspect or ap- pearance alone [see also 1960:68 and 1963:272, which adds:] . . . because metamorphosis is pos- sible. 1960:69. The capacity for metamorphosis is one of the features which links human beings with other-than-human persons in their behavioral environment. 1963:272. Metamorphosis is one of the generic properties manifest by beings of the persons class, but not manifest by all animate beings. 1958:79. Human beings and other-than-human IMMORTALITY</page><page sequence="24">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 113 persons are alike in another way. The human self does not die; it continues its existence in another place, after the body is buried in the grave. In this way human beings are as immortal as the dtiso'kanak. SPEECH, UNDERSTANDING VOLITION SOCIAL RELATIONS, SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, extending through persons class 1960:56. Speaking to a stone dramatizes the depth of the categorical difference in cognitive orientation between the Ojibwa and ourselves. . . .Use of speech as a mode of communication raises the animate status of the boulder to the level of social interaction common to human be- ings. ... The stone was treated as if it were a "person" . . without inferring that objects of this class are, for the Ojibwa, necessarily con- ceptualized as persons. 1960:66. "My father used to tell me . . . that a bear always understands what you tell him." . .. This Indian was not confronted with an animal with "objective" ursine properties, but rather with an animate being who had ursine attributes and also "person attributes." 1960:66. Interaction . . . with certain kinds of plants and animals in everyday life is structured ... as if they were dealing with "persons" who both understand what is being said to them and have volitional capacities as well. 1960:52. "Social relations" between human be- ings (dnicindbek) and other-than-human "per- sons" are of cardinal significance. These rela- tions are correlative with their more compre- hensive categorization of "persons." 1963:273. From the Ojibwa point of view, "social interaction" with persons of the other-than-hu- man class is not metaphorical. 1963:276. This social web of interpersonal rela- tions is distinctive, because, while analogous to the social orders of mankind, for the Ojibwa it includes other-than-human persons, with equiva-</page><page sequence="25">114 * ETHOS lent properties, who play a vital part in their daily lives and in the functioning of a greater social whole. 1960:63-64. Thunder Birds .. social organiza- tion and kinship terminology are precisely the same as the Ojibwa.... And the fact that they belong to the category of itiso'kanak is no bar- rier to their descending to earth and mating with human beings. VALUES 1960:76. The same values are implied through- out the entire range of "social interaction" that characterizes the Ojibwa world; the same stan- dards which apply to mutual obligations be- tween human beings are likewise implied in the reciprocal relations between human and other-than-human "persons." Loci OF 1960:74-75. We are confronted over and over CAUSALITY again with the roles of "persons" as loci of causality in the dynamics of their universe. For the Ojibwa make no cardinal use of any concept of impersonal forces as major determinants of events.... The personalistic theory of causation ... inevitably directs the reasoning of individuals towards an explanation of events in personalis- tic terms. Who did it, who is responsible, is al- ways the crucial question to be answered. Per- sonalistic explanation of past events is found in myths. . . . Personalistic explanation is central in theories of disease causation. 1963:270. Various classes of events are connected in some way with the activities of "persons." In the Ojibwa universe, events may be said to be the consequence of the behavior of persons. 1955:181. The power ranking of different classes of entities is so important because events only become intelligible in terms of their activities. All the effective agents of events throughout the entire behavioral environment of the Ojibwa are selves-my own self or other selves. Imper-</page><page sequence="26">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 115 sonal forces are never the causes of events. Some- body is always responsible. DEGREE OF POWER (higher than nonpersons) 1960:70. What looks like an animal, without great power, may be a transformed person with evil intent. 1958:76. There are many degrees of power.... At the lower level, the ordinary human being and the ordinary animal are in the same class. . . Powerful men . .. can make inanimate ob- jects behave as if they were animate.... Sorcer- ers can transform themselves . . . because they have acquired a high order of power. ... In these manifestations they are elevated to the same level of power as that displayed by other- than-human persons. t.7 Other-than-human persons (vs. t.6 human beings) PROPERTIES THAT HUMAN BEINGS: IMMORTALITY, ETERNAL (no ghosts) INHERENT METAMORPHOSIS POWER DISTINGUISH OTHER-THAN-HUMAN PERSONS FROM 1955:180. Pawdganak (t.7) had "bodies" and "souls" but no "ghosts." . . . The pawdkanak, who are eternal, do not die; they never become djibaiak [ghosts]. NOTE: Djibaiak are deceased human beings, the soul in ghost form. See classes t.12 and t.13. 1960:65. "Persons" of this class are capable of metamorphosis by their very nature. 1960:69. It is taken for granted that all the dtiso'kanak can assume a variety of forms. In the case of human beings, while the potentiality for metamorphosis exists and may even be experi- enced . . .power of this degree can only be ac- quired by human beings through the help of other-than-human persons. 1963:272. Metamorphosis is more characteristic of them [t.7] than of human beings because it is an earmark of power.</page><page sequence="27">116 * ETHOS METAMORPHOSIS OF SOUL, NOT BODY HUMAN BEINGS DEPEND ON t.7 CLASS: ONE-WAY GIVING OF "BLESSINGS" 1960:68. A human being consists of a vital part, or soul, which, under certain circumstances may become detached from the body, so that it is not necessary to assume that the body part, in all cases, literally undergoes transformation into an animal form. The body of the sorcerer may re- main in his wigwam while his soul journeys elsewhere and appears to another person in the form of an animal. NOTE: This seems to differ from t.7, who do not leave a body behind when they take on different forms. Hallowell does not point out this difference. 1963:274. Every special aptitude-all a man's subsequent success, and the explanation of many of his failures, hinged upon the aid of other- than-human persons. 1955:104. An attitude of dependence upon these pawdganak [t.7]. Human beings are conceived of as intrinsically weak and helpless . . . it is essential that assistance be secured from other- than-human selves. 1955:182. Since . . . the ultimate source of this power rests in the hands of the pawdganak, the fundamental relationship of the Ojibwa self to the pawdganak is clearly defined. It is one of dependence. HUMAN BEINGS "TALK" WITH CARE ABOUT t.7 1958:67. The itiso'kanak . .. are never "talked about" casually by the Ojibwa. When they are mentioned, the occasion is a kind of invocation. ... To the Ojibwa, their "talk" about these en- tities, although expressed in formal narrative, is not fiction. 1963:284. There is a general tabu on any refer- ence to the relations of a man and his "dream visitors."</page><page sequence="28">OJIBWA TAXONOMY AND PERCEPT AMBIGUITY * 117 SPECIAL ORDER 1963:281.
