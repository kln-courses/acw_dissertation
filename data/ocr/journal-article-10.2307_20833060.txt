<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEOLOGY IN ISLAM ZIAUDDIN AHMED Early Muslims, especially during the time of the Prophet and his Companions, do not appear to have had any speculative discussions in matters of doctrine. Their faith was plain; they had nothing except the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet to prove the unity of God or other tenets of their religion.1 This state of affairs did not continue for long. With the expansion of Islam, dogmatic speculations began to creep into the body politic of the Muslims. Several reasons may be suggested for this. Firstly, the Qur'In itself contains plenty of verses which appeal to human reasoning. For instance, some verses indicate that every act of man is preordained and that man is subordinate to God's will, while according to some other verses, man is responsible for his actions.2 Se condly, Islam had to defend itself against attacks by peoples of different faiths ? Christians, Jews and Polytheists. In refutation of their dogmas, polemical arguments were employed in the Qur'an. The Prophet was asked to call the people to the way of God with wisdom and fair exhortation and to reason with them in the best way (Qur'an, 16:126). Thus the Qur'an itself contains the seed for the later development of 'Ilm al-Kaldm ? the Scholastic Theology of Islam.3 Thirdly, instances of speculative discussions among the Companions of the Prophet were not totally absent. It is narrated that once some of the Companions were discussing Qadar (predestination), whereupon the Prophet became very angry and asked them not to indulge in such matters. He further wished them to perform the commandments of God and to refrain from His prohibitions.4 Similarly, it is related that after the battle of ?iffin a man asked 'All whether their journey to Syria was destined by God. 'AH gave the explanation in terms of Qaaja and Qadar, i.e., all actions were eternally decreed by God, hence destined.5 Finally, before the end of the first century of Hijrah, a large number of people of other faiths and cultures were converted to Islam, hence some influence of their cultures in the subse quent developments cannot be denied.6</page><page sequence="2">94 ZIAUDDIN AHMED Khawdrij, Shi 'ah and MurjVah. Whatever the causes of the future development of 'Ilm al-Kalam, a close observation of the political events that took place in early Islam would show that they had a great impact on the theological ideas which developed later. According to Watt, "Exponents of the sociology of knowledge would hold that all theological and philosophical ideas have a political and social reference."7 Soon after the Prophet died, there arose a serious controversy between the Muhajirun and the Ansar in connection with the selection of his successor. This controversy was not allowed to result in any immediate development of ideas. A theological factor, however, first arose with the battles of the Camel and ?iffin. The political conflicts that arose out of these two civil wars divided the Muslims into several groups, which ultimately resulted into so-called theological sects ? the Shi'ah, the Khawdrij and, of course, the Murji'ah. A glance over the fundamental principles of these groups will show that the question of succession to the Prophet was the fountain-head of all their dogmatic controversies. Some of the Companions, though few in number, are said to have been of the opinion that 'AH was of greater excellence and was more preferable than Abtl Bakr, 'Umar and others. Among them are mentioned 'Ammar b. Yasir, Abu Dharr al-Ghifarl and al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad.8 In course of time, however, this thought began to take a new colour, and those favouring the cause of 'Ali were now called Shi'at 'All. Towards the end of the Caliphate of 'Uthman, 'Abd Allah b. Saba', a Jew converted to Islam, is said to have initiated the major points of the Shi'ah dogmas.9 According to the Shi'ites, Khilafah (or Tmdmah as they call it) was a divine institution which could *not be left with the people. It was a part of the Faith; no prophet could leave it to the discretion of the community. It was obligatory upon him to appoint his successor who must be infallible, and it was 'AH whom the Prophet actually appointed.10 This theory led them to conclude that the position of 'Ali was higher than that of all other Companions including Abti Bakr and 'Umar.11 To the Zaydites, the moderate group of the Shi'ites, the first three Caliphs committed sin by accepting the Caliphate knowing full well that 'Ali was more exalted than they were.12 According to the extremists, the first three Caliphs became infidels due to their usurpation of the Imdmah from 'All whom the Prophet nominated as his successor. This group is known as Rawafid. Some extreme Shi'ites attributed even divinity to 'AH.13 In the Kharijite view, 'UthmSn, 'All, the two arbitrators of the</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 95 battle of SifTm, those who accepted the arbitration and those who took part in the battle of the Camel were all Kafirs. Hence revolt against them was obligatory. According to them, except the Najdites, a grave sin committed a man to Kufr.14 Their political doctrine was that the Muslims must be governed by a leader whose claim to the caliphal office was based upon his being the best qualified Muslim. It was not necessary for the Muslims to elect their Caliph from the Quraysfc. Probably this theory led them to make a number of revolts against the subsequent rule of the Umayyads and the Abbasids.15 Like those of the Shl'ites, the theories of the Kharijites that were first formulated with the political controversies eventually resulted in many theological dogmas. Between the extremism of the Kharijites and that of the Shl'ites, there was a moderate group of men, among whom was 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar, who adopted an attitude of political neutrality. They suspended their judgment regarding both the groups and left them to the will of God: "To us all of them believers. We neither withdraw from them, nor curse them, nor do we bear witness against them. We leave their affairs to God: He will give judgment regarding them".16 The attitude of their political quietism in a state when each of the quarrelling groups was held by their opponents as infidels and transgressors might have been a source of help for the consolidation of the existing Umayyad rule.17 It is perhaps true that the theories that were to culminate almost immediately in the dogmas of a third sect, viz., the Murjites, were the eventual consequence of the antagonism which raged between the Kharijites and the Shl'ites. Ahmad Amin rightly observes that had there not been the kharijites, there would not have been the Sprites, and cer tainly there would not have been the Murjites.18 The positions adopted by the moderate group, however, did not start taking dogmatic colour until the controversy of the Kharijites and the Shl'ites became a factor to determine the sphere of Iman and Kufr. The fCharijites regarded all, except those who agreed with them, as Kafirs, and in their eyes, every mortal sin is Kufr. Similarly, the extreme gh^'ites did not consider any one outside their community as a Mu'min. To them, allegiance to their Imam was a part of 7man.19 On the other side, the Murjites held that Iman was to believe in God and His Apostle; anyone who believed in Him and His Apostle was a Mu'min, even though he committed a grave sin or did not pay homage to any Imam.20 This was a clear contradiction to the dogmas of the ghlrijites an(j the gy?ites. Some of the Murjites went so</page><page sequence="4">96 ZIAUDDIN AHMED far as to assert that a man who believed in God and His Apostle did not cease to be a Muslim, even if he uttered any word liable to Kufr, or per formed any such act.21 In any case, the Murjites excluded actions ('Amal) from the conception of Imdn. Politically this meant that the Umayyads or other Muslims did not cease to be Muslims because of their unlawful activities. Therefore, to pay allegiance to them and to perform religious duties under their authority was obligatory.22 The thesis that actions did not form a part of Imdn raised another controversy, that is, whether Imdn was liable to increase and decrease. The result was natural: Imdn, the belief in God and His Apostle, being an abstract thing could not increase and decrease. But actions ('Amdl), being a part of Imdn certainly increase or decrease it. Similarly, a mortal sin (Kablrah) being Kufr in the view of the Kharijites, led those who committed it to the everlasting punishment of Hell. But as it was not Kufr in the eyes of the Murjites, it might cause punishment for a short time.2 3 Jabriyah and Qadariyah. The controversy about predestination and free will is perhaps a natural outcome when one ponders that God is Omnipotent and All-knowing. Nothing of what happened in the past, or what is to happen in the future, is outside His knowledge. On the one hand, He knows, each and every vice or virtue that a man will commit in future. And, on the other hand, man is held responsible for what he does, and will be justly rewarded or punished for it.24 A study of the Qur'an will reveal that it contains in numerable verses which suggest that every action of man is predetermined by God. Man is completely subordinate to His will. Man cannot do anything unless God wills it. On the other hand, there are many passages in the Qur'an where man is presented as a responsible agent. Similarly, we have many Traditions Which bear a fatalistic tendency. In some Tradi tions, it has been held that every thing that happens in this world was written down in the distant past. Some Traditions say that while the embryo is in the womb, certain things ? the sex, its sustenance, its term (ajal) and whether it is miserable or happy were written down by the angel.25 So it can be said, as Wensink concludes, that the advocates of predes tination, as well as those of free will, could claim a scriptural basis for their views.26 In the history of Muslim theology, the persons who first insti tuted discussions on Qadar (free will) are Ma'bad al-Juhani and Ghaylan al-Dimagkqi. Ma'bad along with Ibn al-Agh'ath revolted against the</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 97 existing Umayyad rule and was executed by order of al-Hajjaj in 80/699. Ghaylan is reported to have been killed by Higham b. 'Abd al-Malik for holding Qadarite views. Ma'bad was a disciple of al-Hasan al-Basri (d. 110/728-9), who is said to have held Qadarite views in some res pects.27 It may be that in the region of lower Euphrates, it was not only Christianity but also other religions that influenced Islamic ideas. As a matter of fact, it is reported that Ma'bad conversed with a Christian from Mesopotamia named Sansuia who accepted Islam but later aposta tised. Likewise, one information links Ghaylln's dogmatic views with Yahya al-Dimashql, a Christian officer of the royal courts of Damascus.28 Towards the closing period of the Umayyad rule, the dogma of Jabr (compulsion) was pioneered by Jahm b. Safwan, a client of Bantl Rasib, called al-Tirmidy, sometimes al-Samarqandi, in contrast with the dogma of Qadar. Jahm was secretary of al-Harith b. Surayj, The man with the black banner', who revolted against the Umayyads from 116/734 to 128/746 in Khorasan and was executed shortly before Harith himself.29 Jahm is considered as the initiator of the doctrine of Jabr, according to which man acted only metaphorically as the sun acts in setting.30 To speak more clearly, man is like a feather hung in the wind, it moves when the wind moves and stops when the wind does so, there being no distinc tion between a man and an inanimate nature.31 This extremism in the conception of Jabr is probably resulted from his anti-anthropomorphic ideas, as will be seen presently. Jahm b. Safwan denied the attributes of God. To him, God cannot have any attributes that a created being possesses. He is neither seen, nor does He talk to anybody. Therefore, the Qur'an is created. Hell and paradise cannot be everlasting, because the eternity is only God's attribute. God has only two attributes, viz., Fi'l and Khalq, the attributes of doing and creation which no man can possess, thus placing man com pletely under compulsion in his actions.32 More generally, Jahm and his followers denied the distinct existence of all attributes of God, and were, therefore, accused of Ta 'til (making God a bare unity), and called Mu'attilah.*3 For attributes of God, such as hand and face occuring in the Qur'an, he had a metaphorical interpretation.34 It is said that Jahm had a quarrel with Muqatil b. Sulayman (d. 150/767) who was an extreme anthropomorphism Imam Abu IJanlfa is quoted as saying that Jahm went so far in his denial of anthropomorphism (Tashbih) as to declare that 'God is nothing (Allah laysa bi shay')\ And Muqatil's ex tremism, on the other side, likened God with His creatures.35</page><page sequence="6">98 ZIAUDDIN AHMED Jahm might have been greatly influenced by foreign ideas in the formulation of his theological views. He is reported to have taken his dogmatic views from al-Ja'd b. Dirham who was an inhabitant of Harran where the Sabi'ah and the Falasifah were the vigorous upholders of anti anthropomorphic ideas.36 He is also quoted as having taken the idea of Khalq al-Qur'an through two intermediate links from Labid b. al-A'sam al-Yahudi who bewitched the Prophet.37 Jahm also had a debate on the nature of God with a group of Sumniya, an Indian sect who were extreme in anthropomorphism and held the theory of transmigration of souls. After the debate he was so greatly puzzled that he abandoned saying prayers for forty days on the plea that he would not pray to whom he did not know.38 It has been seen from the above discourse that Jahm, on the one hand, upheld the doctrine of Jabr which the Qadariyah totally denied. On the other hand, Jahm was the forerunner of the Mu'tazilites in the denial of the attributes of God, on which stood the foundation of their dogmas. The Jabriyah and the Qadariyah, however, do not appear to have survived as regular sects in the history of Muslim theology. The dogmas initiated by them merged into the doctrines of other sects,39 as will be seen later. Mutakallimun. With the advent of the Abbasid dynasty, Muslim theology marked a distinct departure from what was till then in a rather early stage to a place where the most important chapter was added to the history of Islam. It was in this period that the administrative responsibilities were transferred gradually to the class of secretaries who were the bearers of Persian culture or rather Persianised culture of Iraq including the Hellenistic elements. Among them were those who had been Chris tians, Zoroastrians and Manicheans before they accepted Islam.40 In the early Abbasid period, however, there seem to have been two main streams of philosophical tradition influencing the Islamic world. Firstly, that of Jundeshapur from where a Nestorian family supplied court phy sicians to the Caliphs, and at the same time were responsible for a teach ing hospital in Baghdad. Besides the strict medical curriculum, there must have been some philosophical works here, Secondly, that of Alexan drian college of Harran which was under Christian direction. In yarran there was a centre belonging to the Sabi'ah who had a basis in Greek philosophy.!1</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGY IN ILSAM 99 It is probable that long before the time of al-MSmun and his organisation of translations, the Muslims had begun to realise the im portance of logical methods to be employed in the defence of Islam from the criticisms of the members of other faiths. In fact there is evidence that sometimes discussions and disputations were held between Muslim and non-Muslim scholars in matters of doctrine. Eventually, the Mus lims, particularly the Mu'tazilites, studied the Greek philosophy and adopted the dialectical methods in discussing the dogmas of Islam on the conception of substance, accidents, actions, generated actions, per sonality of God, His attributes and so on. Thus a new science was in troduced called 7/m aUKalam, that is, the Scholastic Theology of Islam.42 Kaldm was first used for the speech of God, but later came to be the name for theology, probably during the time of al-Mamtln as held by al-Shah rastani.43 It appears that in the beginning, Fiqh was used for the specula tive side of theology, as well as of cannon law, as opposed to 7/m for the traditional side. Imlm Aba Hanifa is reported to have said, "a/ Fiqh fi'l-Din afdal min al-Fiqh fi'l-Ilrrt\ Knowledge of faith is superior to knowledge of law.44 A theological discourse ascribed to him is named as 'al-Fiqhi al-Akbar\ The first exponents of the science of Kalam were the Mu'tazilites who did most to defend Islamic beliefs rationally and philosophically. In course of time, however, there arose Mutakallimun on the Sunnite side, viz. the Agh'arites and the Maturidites who opposed the Mu'tazilites and endeavoured to uphold the traditional concepts of Islamic dogmas equally rationally. Whatever stories may have been related about the origin of the name of Mu'tazila, it is evident that the doctrine of I'tizdl (al-Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn) formed the starting point for the creation of the school of the Mu'tazila.45 Wasil b. 'At;V (d. 131 l.H.) and 'Amr b. 'Ubayd (d. 145 A.H.) previously belonging to the school of al-Hasan al-Basri, were the first to formulate it. A critical view of their doctrinal standpoints would suggest that the early Muslim theologians had no interest in the philosophical conception of the dogmas; the problems were those which had been already current since the early sectarian views.46 The great intellectual expansion that took place in Mu'tazilism later did not com mence until the time of Harun al-Ragltfd. However, with the emergence of Wasil and 'Amr, a number of the Qadaris joined the Mu'tazilites; Qadari and Mu'tazili were soon to become synonymous terms.47 It has been seen that it was Basra where Mu'tazilism originated. Then it soon spread to Iraq to become the official creed of the Abbasids.</page><page sequence="8">100 ZIAUDDIN AHMED Between the two schools of Mu'tazilism, one at Basra and another at Baghdad, there were many differences on minor points, but the funda mentals remained the same. The man who did most to establish the general Mu'tazilite position was Abu'l-Hudhayl al-'Allaf (d. 235 A.H.). He is reckoned the founder of Mu'tazilite theology in Basra, and was res ponsible for initiating discussions of Islamic dogmas in terms of Greek philosophical conception.48 Bighr b. Mu'tamir (d. 210 A.H.) is regarded as the founder of the Baghdad branch of Mu'tazilism. Among the doctri nes especially attributed to him is that of 'Generated actions ()' which raises the problems of how far a man is responsible for his acts. Originally the name Mu'tazila was applied fairly widely, and seemed to have included all who discussed dogmatic problems philosophically. But by about 900 A.D. it was restricted to those who in addition to employ ing philosophical methods accepted the five points of Mu'tazilite dogmatic position.50 Below are the five fundamental principles of the Mu'tazilite dogmas on which the whole structure of their theology rests: (/) Tawhid: Unity of God. (ii) al-'Adl: Justice or righteousness of God. (iii) al-Wa'dand al-Wa'id: Promise and threat. (iv) aUManzila bayn al-Manzilatayn: The intermediate position between I man and Kufr. (v) al-Amr bi'l-Ma'ruf wa'l-Nahy 'an aUMunkar: enjoining good and forbidding evil. The first point, i. e. the unity of God, or rather the assertion of the unity of God, is most important of all the points. It implies for the Mu'ta zilites much more than the mere assertion that God is one and that there are not many gods.51 The term Tawhid means strict profession of mono theism: denial of all kinds of resemblance between God and His creatures and rejection of all sorts of dualism and anthropomorphism.52 Probably this thesis led them to conclude that all the Qur'anic attributes had no real existence; they were not entities added to the Divine Being. The Mu'ta zilite tendency to make an allegorical interpretation of all the verses that have any sort of anthropomorphic bearing seems to have resulted from this thesis.53 Eventually, however, this culminated in many dogmas. In case of many Traditions, for instance, those suggesting the beatific vision, the Mu'tazilite rejected them because they were Akhbar al-Ahad</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 101 which could not be accepted as against the clear version of the Qur'an, that is jW^l *T&gt;- V . But the Ahl al-Sunna upheld all such Traditions.54 By way of illustration a few Mu'tazilite doctrines arisng out of their con ception of the unity of God are mentioned here : i) Denial of anthropomorphism implies denial of God's being in any place : He is not located anywhere. So His seating on the Throne ('Arsh) cannot be conceived of in their view. There fore, the verse : (7 : 52) has to be interpreted allegorically in the sense that He is the ruler. (ff) The vision of God in this world or in the hereafter implies that He must be in a place with sufficient light, having some colour, as well as within the view of one who will see Him. This can only be conceived of a corporeal being. For the Qur'anic argument they put forward the verses suggesting the invisibility of God, and those denoting otherwise were inter preted allegorically.5 6 (iff) The most important of the Mu'tazilite doctrines arising out of their conception of the unity of God, which dominated the theological as well as the political history of Islam in the third century of the Hijra, was that of the Kaldm of God. For them, if the Kaldm of God or what He spoke to Moses be taken as eternal as His Being it would then introduce multiplicity in the Divine nature. Tfierefore, the Qur'an, the Kaldm of God to the prophet which itself has multiple aspects, e.g., its division into chapters and chapters with beginnings and ends, and again the fact that it is read and heard, cannot be an attribute of God. Hence the Qur'an must be created, because any thing not eternal is essentially created.57 The orthodox section of the Muslims or rather those who were uphold ing the traditional views were always avoiding such speculations. Instead of showing any interest in explaining the essence of God or His attributes, they plainly believed in what they found in the Qur'an and received from the Prophet without specifying any question of how and drawing any comparison.58 To indulge in the question of createdness or uncrea tedness of the Qur'an was an innovation in their view.59 It seems, however, that the governmental attempt for forcible introduction of the doctrine of the Createdness of the Qur'an was sufficient to be met by the</page><page sequence="10">102 ZIAUDDIN AHMED insistence that it was the uncreated word of God. Arguments were de veloped on both sides with great subtlety. And perhaps in reaction to the atrocities meted out to those who refused to accept this dogma, some of the Hanbalites held that even its utterance and letters were uncreated.60 A faction of them went so far as to assert that its binding and board were also uncreated. Al-Agh'ari (d. 330 A.H.), who broke with his Mu'tazilite teacher al-Jubba'I and was reckoned the founder of orthodox Scholasticism, introduced a new conception in the Kaldm of God. According to him, Kaldm has two considerations, (/) al-Kalam al-Nafsi: the unexpressed thought of mind, (//) al-Kalam al-Lafzi: its utterance. Al-Kalam al-Nafsi of God is identical with His being, and in its second perspective it is essen tially the act of man, hence created. The Mu'tazilites, however, do not appear to have become reconciled with al-Ag^'ari's conception of al-Kalam al-Nafsi.61 Al-'Adl. Every Muslim believes that God is just and righteous. But the Mu'tazilite speculation of a just and righteous God created many dogmas. For them, the righteousness of God demands that all that God does is best for His creatures. He does not desire evil, nor ordains it; man will be rewarded for good deeds and will be punished for evil ones. This means that man is free in his actions and that he creates them. There fore, the responsibility is his. Thus the Mu'tazilites were the heirs of the Qadarites.62 The above two principles, i.e., those of unity and justice, are the most important points of the Mu'tazilite doctrine. Indeed they were proud of calling themselves as 'The people of unity and justice'.63 Al-Wa'd Wa'l-Wa'idandAl-Manzila Bayna'L-Manzilatayn. These two principles are based on their conception of Imdn and the justice of God. On the question of Imdn they held that action was a part of it. Now sins were of two categories: Kabd 'ir and Sagha 'ir. Kabd 'ir were those where punishment was threatened, and were named as Fisq, a position between Imdn and Kufr. As for the justice of God, they held that God is bound to reward those who obeyed Him and punish those who committed grave sins. Otherwise, threat of punishment and promise would be meaningless.64</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 103 Al-Amr Bi'L-Ma'ruf Wa'L-Nahy 'An Al-Munkar, enjoining good and forbidding evil. In its full implication it meant, according to the Mu'tazilites, that in order to preserve the SharVah, efforts must be made publicly, and if possible with the application of force. Its political im plication possibly was one of the causes which prevented its being evaluated in all its perspectives by the heresiographers. It appears, however, that the Mu'tazilites were not fanatics like the Khariiites against sinners.65 Unlike those of the earlier sects, the dogmas of the Mu'tazilites played a smaller part in the early political affairs. Still they had opi nions on certain points of the then political theology, although they differed among themselvs. Most of the Mu'tazilites, except Hi^am al-FuwSti and Abu Bakr al-Asamm, held that according to the SharVah, an Imam was indispensable for the administration of the affairs of the Muslims.66 They also differed among themselves regarding the theory of 'al-A'immat min Quraysh\ To Dirar, even an A'jamt could be preferable to a Qura^ki for Imdmah?67 On the first four Caliphs and their hierarchical order for the Caliphate, the Mu'tazilite opinion viewed as a whole seems to have reflected a rather mixed feeling, occasionally with some ambiguity. They regarded the Caliphate of Abu Bakr as legitimate, but differed as to who was superior for it. 'Amr b. 'Ubayd and the Basri group of the Mu'tazilites preferred Abu Bakr to 'AH. In their view, it appears, the hierarchical position of the first four Caliphs was in accordance with their succession to the Caliphate. According to the Baghdad group, 'All was superior to Abu Bakr. Wasil and Abu'l-Hudhayl al-A'llaf, although they remained neutral about Abtl Bakr and 'All, appear to have credited 'All with a superiority to *Uthmln, but refrained from any com mitments against 'Ut&amp;man, as well as his murderers. Indeed, some of the Mu'tazilites were very critical of 'Uthman for the nepotism he was alleged to have shown in administrative and monetary affairs during the second half of his Caliphate.68 Wa?il and 'Amr adopted an attitude of neutrality about the indivi duals who took part in the quarrels which raged round the Caliphate of 'All. According to them, all were pious believers, but war split them into two parties, who could not both be right One of the parties had sinned, but "We do not know which. We leave their cause to Him who knows it". Some held that 'All was on the right path, and that his opponents, viz. Jalha, al-Zubayr and 'A'ijtah ultimately repented of their revolt against 'All.69 In case of what took place subsequently between 'All and</page><page sequence="12">104 ZIAUDDIN AHMED Mu'Iwiyah, the Mu'tazilite took a favourable view of the cause of the for mer. Al-Balkhl, one of the Mu'tazilite Imams, is said to have gone so far as to accuse Mu'awiya and 'Amr b. al-'As of heresy. This might have been a source of encouragement for al-MSmun who ordered the cursing of Mu'awiyah publicly from the pulpit of the mosques.70 From the above discussions on some aspects of the Mu'tazilite atti tude towards the early political controversies, it becomes clear that the Mu'tazilites were in no way apologetic in their opinions about the activities of the Companions (Sahaba), let alone the Successors (Tabi'un). On many occasions the Companions themselves were very critical of each other. This suggests that they were not immune from committing mistakes. Therefore, the Mu'tazilites did not consider that the Companions comman ded any superior position to that of other Muslims. All that can be said is that the Companions saw the Prophet and others did not.71 Muhaddithnn. During the early years of Islam many learned and pious Muslims spread all over the Muslim empire, and a large number of pupils gathered around them. In the main centres of Islam, 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar, 'Abd Allah b. 'A'mr b. Al-'As, Abu Mftsa al-Ash'ari and Anas b. Milik, were among the Companions who were responsible for upholding the teachings of Islam during the time of the Umayyads'72 It appears that since the time of the Prophet a general religious movement was in progress among the Muslims, and this movement does not seem to have been politicallly affected like those of the Kharijites and the Shi'ites. Instead of showing any interest in the political conflicts, the pioneers of this movement, which may be called as a moderate body of the Muslims, used to meet, probably in mosques, to discuss purely religious questions. During this period no clear distinction was apparent between the different fields of interest, and views in different fields might be reported of the same person. Gradually, however, the science of Tradition became of great importance.7 3 It was the practice of the Companions of the Prophet that they used to decide their day-to-day affairs in the fields of law, doctrine and indi vidual piety according to what they understood from the Qur'an and heard from the Prophet or saw him to perform. It is equally true that sometimes they used to apply reason (Ra'y) or analogical judgment where they failed find any direct ruling in the Qur'an and the Traditions. Among them 'Umar and 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud are quoted as having frequently applied Ra'y in legal matters. In course of time this came to be associated with</page><page sequence="13">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 105 Abu Hanlfa, the Imlm of the Iraqi school of Ra'y.74 A separate trend of thought appears to have been in progress simultaneously in legal matters, which later came to be known as the HijSzI school of AM al-Haditk Here also were a number of leading Companions, namely, 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar and 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr b. al-'As, who were not in favour of giving opinions, even though they did not find any ruling in the Qur'an and Tradi tions.75 Malik and al-?hlfi'I are regarded as the champions of this school,76 although they used a certain degree of reasoning. According to them, weak Traditions were preferable to the application of Ra'y, while Abtl tlanifa preferred Ra'y to many Traditions which were not well founded.77 It was perhaps as a reaction to the tendency towards a rather fre quent use of Ra'y in legal matters that the Traditionist movement grew up, since many men felt that a Tradition from the Prophet was a sounder basis for action in legal matters than a combination of personal opinion or discretion.78 A number of schools of thought within the Traditionist movement, notably those of al-Awza'I in Syria and al-Layth b. Sa'd in Egypt, grew up almost independently of the HijazI school of Ahl al-Hadith, but could not survive as separate disciplines.79 However, towards the end of the Umayyad period, the Traditionist movement as an independent discipline started, and during the subsequent Abbasid period, it dominated the Muslim religious thought. During this period, the famous books of Traditions were compiled, and the MuhaddithUn devised a critique of Tradition to separate the genuine from the false. Indeed, the Traditionists played a great role in the field of Muslim dogma. Unfortunately, however, we have no means for making a direct study of them as in the case of sects, because they were not a sect; their position can only be studied in the large mass of information available in the biographical dictionaries and similar other works, vis-a-vis the sectarian dogmas they reacted against. In the formative period of the Traditionist movement before 850 A.D., the Traditionists were not so much specialists in Traditions as per sons with particular standpoint. In the general religious movement of the Umayyad period, out of which the Traditionist movement grew, many different opinions had been held. There had been Traditionists who sym pathised with the dogma of free will, as well as with the dogma of Irjd'. There were also men of Shi'ite sympathies among them. Gradually, however, the Traditionist movement settled down to a rejection of the</page><page sequence="14">106 ZIAUDDIN AHMED doctrine of Free will, Irja* and Shfism, and to the formation of the great dogmas of Sunnism.80 It appears that the Mutakalimfln of the Mu'tazilites could not gain much ground until the time of al-Mamun. HarfLn al-Ras||id is said to have asked the people to refrain from discussing dogmas (Jidal fi'l-Din); he even imprisoned some of the Mu'tazilites.81 The Mu'tazilites were, however, favoured by al-Mamun, and at the instigation of its advocates, Mu'tazilismwas declared as the official creed. With the accession of al Mutwakkil to power, the situation was just the reverse. Mu'tazilism was denounced by a royal decree. Ibn Hanbal proved himself a hero during the Mihna instituted by al-Mamun, and now the Hanbalis, or rather the puritanic wing of the Sunnis, became prominent.82 In theological matters, the fundamental difference between the Mutakallimun and the Traditionists was that the approach of the former was mainly rational, and that of the latter was to uphold the traditional views which had developed within the general religious movement since the time of the Prophet.83 With regard to the verses that speak of the attributes of God, apparently tending to an anthropomorphic idea, the Traditionists main tained that they should be taken in their literal sense without asking any question and drawing any comparison. Sometimes it might have been thought that to enter into the speculation of the apparently anthropomor phic verses would in no way be beneficial for the average people. The Prophet himself expressed satisfaction when a slave girl testified that God is in Heaven. 'AH is reported to have said, "Say to the people what they understand. Do you want them to be led to unbelief in Allah and His apostle?"84 Malik b. Anas is quoted as saying, "Istiwa. is known, its specification is inconceivable, to believe in it is obligatory, and to ask about it is a Bid'ah". A similar story is reported of Rabfa al-RS'y. To be pre cise, the Traditionists were by no means at par with the Mutakallimun in the speculation of dogmas.85 The Traditionists or the Ahl al-Sunna appear to have attached great importance to the consensus of opinion in determining their position re garding the early political controversies. According to them, the institu tion of Khilafah was not a matter to be divinely decreed, nor was anyone designated by the Prophet as his successor. The Khilafah of Abu Bakr and that of the subsequent three Caliphs were established by the con</page><page sequence="15">THEOLOGY IN ISLAM 107 scnsus of the Muslims in accordance with the hierarchical order. But, it is said that there was a group of Ahl al-Sunna who held that 'All was supe rior to 'Uthmain. To this group, however, all the Companions were just and pious believers. Their attitude was, "We shall not make any adverse comment against the Companions for what occurred among them". To them, all the conflicts resulted from difference of judgement (Ikhtildf fi'l-Ijtihad). With regard to the head of state, their doctrine was that the Khalifah must be a member of the Quray$jj. This was established by the concensus of the Muhajirun and the Ansar on the Day of the Saqifa, and was later agreed upon by other Muslims. The disagreement of the KhawSrij and the Shl'ah could not be regarded as doing any harm to what was established earlier by Ijma'. Revolt against the existing Sultan was not lawful, and to go into Jihad under his direction was obligatory, except when he committed an act of Kufr.*6 It has been said earlier that actions were excluded from the Mur jite conception of Iman. To the Mu'tazilites, actions constituted a part of Iman. The Traditionists appear to have adopted a middle way between these two extreme views, as will be seen presently. Although the concep tion of the Traditionists seems to have corresponded to that of the Mu' tazilites in counting actions as a part of Iman, yet their difference was unbridgable. According to the Mu'tazilites, actions were a constituent part. But in the Traditionists' view, they were included in it as a condition to complete Iman (JU53I J^-i). in effect it would mean that the man who com mitted a grave sin or did not perform an obligatory act was a perfect Mu'min in the Murjite view. To the Mu'tazilites, he was neither a Mu'min, nor a Kafir, but in an intermediate position between Iman and Kufr. And according to the Traditionists, he was not a perfect Mu'min ? Fasiq as held by the majority, or a Mundfiq as was the opinion of al Ilasan al-Basri. The profession of belief would, however, commit a man to the community of Islam. He would not be regarded a Kafir unless he performed a sin liable to Kufr. Since Iman, according to the Traditionists, comprised belief and actions, it was liable to increase and decrease. This would mean that the performance of the acts of SharVah would lead a man to the position of a perfect Mu'min, and to neglect them would bring him down from that position. Imim Abu Hanifa did not include actions in his conception of Iman. Therefore, Iman, according to him, would nei ther increase or decrease. Yet he did not deny the merits ( ) of actions for a Mu'min. That is why he and his supporters were held as Murji'at Ahl al-Sunnah by al-Shahrastanl. It appears, however, that Iman has</page><page sequence="16">108 ZIAUDDIN AHMED two perspectives: (/) belief in God and His apostle, (11) its expression in actions. In its first perspective, it can neither increase nor decrease. But in the second perspective, it certainly increases and decreases. Probably in consideration of these two implications, Imam Malik withheld his opinion about the decrease, but did not deny its increase.87 The controversy on the question of increase and decrease in Imdn is followed by one more problem, that is, whether it is permissible for any one to say, "/ am truly a Mu'min". Those denying its increase and dec rease will not object to him for his assertion of the perfection of Imdn, i.e., his belief in God and his apostle. They will also enjoin that he should not say, *u jl cx*y* ul I am a Mu'min if Allah wills". Because, if Inshd' Allah casts a doubt on his Imdn, it is definitely Kufr. And if it is intended to exclude actions not yet done, or to invoke blessings from God, it is better that it should be avoided, because doubt can be reflected from it. But in view of those affirming the increase and the decrease, it will not be permissible for anybody to assert the perfection of his Imdn by saying, " ut ". Instead he should say " -fil *u o? ut " intending the exclusion (*t?J) of the imperfection of his actions, or the actions them selves not performed or which may not be performed in the future.88 On the question of Jabr and Qadar, the Traditionists (or rather the Ahl al-Sunna) appear to have adopted a middle course between the theory of Compulsion of the Jabriya and that of Free Will of the Qadariya. They uphold the Divine Qadar, that is, God has eternally decreed the good and bad of His creatures as well as their misery and happiness, their sustenance, their sex and so on. For them, this neither means that man is under com pulsion in his actions, nor does it mean that he has no power to acquire them. In their view, predetermination by God and His knowledge are rather indentical, that is, predetermination of things by God means that they are known to Him eternally. In other words, man will go to what is destined eternally for him in the knowledge of God by his own choice and will. To speak clearly, God creates actions in which man has no effective power (^i-Sj-tf) to share with Him. Man rather acquires 0-~-O them on his own accord.8 9 Notes: 1.
