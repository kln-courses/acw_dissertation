Powderly Division of Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri One approach to target the long-term metabolic toxicity and disfiguring body-shape changes associated with antiretroviral therapy is to switch one component of a regimen to an alternative drug, usually from a different class of antiretrovirals. Most commonly, substitutions have involved protease inhibitors, but the thymidine analogue nucleosides, especially stavudine, have been investigated more recently. Certain trends from these studies have emerged. First, if the patient has had sustained viral suppression, switching therapy is generally virologically safe. Second, metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, appear to be at least partially reversible. Substitution of other agents for protease inhibitors has not been associated with reversal or improvement in fat redistribution. Studies in which thymidine analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors have been switched have reported modest improvements in peripheral lipoatrophy. Larger, controlled, long-term studies and a more standardized approach to definition of metabolic and morphological abnormalities are needed. With the clear success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has come increasing concern about long-term adverse events. In particular, serious concerns have been raised about the met- abolic side-effects and body-shape changes that have been increasingly recognized among many patients receiving ART. The metabolic effects, especially hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance (or frank diabetes mellitus), may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The body-shape changes, both pe- ripheral fat loss and fat gain, cause considerable distress for patients. The same holds true for the inconvenient dosing schedules and the number of pills of many antiretroviral reg- imens. All of these factors may lead to decreased adherence to therapy. A possible strategy to counteract this is to switch treatment for patients receiving a successful ART regimen to a simpler regimen-for example, exchanging the protease in- hibitor (PI) for a drug from a different class. This review will concentrate on the virological and metabolic effects of switch- ing a component of a successful potent antiretroviral regimen.

These studies are referred to here as "switch studies." Pro- spective studies with a duration of follow-up of -6 months and a sample size of 10 patients were included. Only a few of these studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals to date; most have been presented only in abstract form. The majority of the studies were not randomized. However, where conclusions were made, greater weight was given to studies in which randomization occurred, allowing a comparison with subjects who continued to receive the original therapy. Most studies investigated a switch from PI-based regimens to nevirapine-, efavirenz-, or abacavir-based regimens. We in- cluded a total of 35 PI-switch studies in our review. Metabolic substudies were included as separate studies. All PI-switch stud- ies are summarized in tables 1-4. More recently, there has been increasing interest in studying the effects of switching thymidine analogues (particularly sta- vudine) on metabolism and body shape. Early data from these studies are included in table 5.

Given that, even in patients with undetectable plasma viremia, suppression of HIV replication is incomplete, it is important to examine only randomized, controlled trials to assess virological safety, because a comparison can be made between patients who switched therapy and those who continued to receive PI-based therapy. Three randomized, controlled trials in which a PI was switched to efavirenz have been reported. In the largest of these studies, 226 patients switched their PI to efavirenz, whereas 120 control subjects continued to receive PI-based regimens. After 48 weeks, 7% of the patients receiving efavirenz had de- tectable plasma HIV RNA, compared with 15% of those who continued to receive PI-based therapy [8]. This difference was statistically significant. A smaller study found a trend toward more-sustained virus suppression in the efavirenz treatment arm [9], whereas another smaller study showed no difference [10]. The studies involving nevirapine have been smaller, with one study showing more virus suppression in patients whose therapy was switched [19] and the other showing equal results [18]. Studies involving abacavir have had more mixed results. The largest of these studies found that patients who switched to abacavir were less likely to experience viral failure at 48 weeks (12% vs. 23% for those who continued to receive the original regimen) [4]. This result was confirmed in another randomized, controlled trial that involved 81 patients [3]. However, in an- other randomized, controlled trial from Switzerland, patients who switched to abacavir were less likely to continue to have undetectable HIV RNA [2]. A possible explanation for the dif- ference in the Swiss study is that it involved patients who had received nucleoside therapy before they started receiving a PI- based suppressive regimen. It is possible that, for such patients, the abacavir-based regimen was not sufficiently potent to fully suppress a virus that had developed some degree of nucleoside resistance. In a recently reported Spanish study [27], 460 patients were randomized to switch to efavirenz, nevirapine, or abacavir. The intent-to-treat analysis did not show any differences (treatment failure occurred in 22%-26% of patients). However, the during- treatment analysis showed more virologic failures in the aba- cavir arm (13% vs. 6% in the nonnucleoside reverse-transcrip- tase inhibitor [NNRTI] arms). More patients in the NNRTI arms discontinued treatment because of difficulties in tolerating the regimen. The majority of patients who had virological fail- ure had received prior nucleoside analogue therapy. This study suggests that the overall effectiveness of switching from a PI to any of these drugs is similar. However, there is a higher risk of virological failure associated with switching to abacavir, es- pecially for patients who have received prior nucleoside mono- or dual therapy. ADHERENCE TO THERAPY AND QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER DISCONTINUING THE PI Some of the large PI-switch studies have documented that im- proved adherence with simplified dosing schedules is one of the most striking features of switching ART regimens. The aforementioned large efavirenz study that involved 226 patients showed significantly improved adherence 1 year after the switch [8]. The same holds true for a trial in which 105 patients switched from PI to abacavir [4]. Another abacavir-switch study did not observe a difference in adherence (improved self- reported adherence was seen in both treatment arms) but nev- ertheless had a better virological outcome [3]. One year after switching from a PI to nevirapine, Spanish patients in 2 studies reported a significantly better quality of life, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire, compared with the baseline score [24] or with the quality of life of a control group that continued to receive PI-based therapy [18]. ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS SUBSTITUTED FOR PIS The observed adverse effects associated with use of abacavir, nevirapine, and efavirenz in switch studies corresponded with the known figures from previous clinical studies. Sixteen of 35 PI-switch studies reported frequencies of treatment discontin- uation or treatment change because of adverse drug effects. Hypersensitivity was the predominant side-effect noted for aba- cavir, and it resulted in the discontinuation of abacavir use for 7% of patients. For the switch studies that examined NNRTIs, adverse effects that led to discontinuation or change of the drug were slightly more common for nevirapine than for efavirenz (14% vs. 10%). The aforementioned large, randomized, controlled trial from Spain that compared abacavir, efavirenz, and nevirapine found significantly more treatment discontinuations for nevirapine or efavirenz (16% and 17%) than for abacavir (6%) [27]. The frequency of nevirapine-associated rash ranged from 4% to 19% in the individual studies and was greater than the rate of nev- irapine-associated hepatitis at a ratio of 2:1 as a reason for study drug discontinuation. Nevirapine-associated hepatitis was predominantly observed in hepatitis C antibody-positive pa- tients. Rash was rare among patients who received efavirenz and did not lead to treatment discontinuations. All treatment discontinuations in the PI-efavirenz-switch studies (4.6%) were because of CNS side-effects. INSULIN SENSITIVITY AFTER SUBSTITUTING THE PI As many as 40% of patients undergoing PI-based ART develop increased insulin resistance. This can lead to diabetes mellitus HIV/AIDS * CID 2002:35 (15 November) * 1225</page><page sequence="8">and may contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular dis- ease. Insulin resistance may also be a factor in the development of other adverse events, especially visceral fat gain [43]. Al- though the mechanism of insulin resistance is unclear, it has been closely linked, in vitro and in vivo, to the use of PIs. Short-term administration of indinavir to healthy HIV-negative volunteers has been shown to be associated with the rapid onset of decreases in insulin sensitivity [44]. Thus, it might be ex- pected that discontinuing use of a PI might improve insulin sensitivity. Eleven of 35 PI-switch studies have examined glu- cose metabolism. The results have not been clear-cut, in part because of design or methodological problems. A cohort study that involved 39 patients found nonsignificant decreases in fast- ing glucose levels and improvements in insulin resistance (mea- sured by an intravenous insulin tolerance test) 6 and 12 months after switching from a PI- to a nevirapine-based regimen. Glu- cagon levels had decreased significantly, and the oral glucose tolerance test results for 3 patients with baseline hyperglycemia became normal [29]. A Spanish trial that involved 23 patients with self-reported lipodystrophy who had opted to switch their PI-based therapy to a nevirapine-based regimen found 15% lower serum glucose values and an 80% improved fasting in- sulin resistance index [45] 12 months after the switch [21, 22]. Similar results were reported by the same group for patients with elevated serum glucose levels whose therapy was switched to efavirenz. For these patients, the fasting insulin resistance index was significantly decreased after 6 months [ 10]. In a study of 26 patients with clinical lipodystrophy, a 21% decrease in insulin levels and a normalization of previously abnormal glu- cose tolerance test findings in 3 out of 5 patients were reported 1 year after switching from PI to efavirenz [11]. A metabolic substudy of 90 patients from the aforementioned large Spanish switch trial of 460 patients [27] showed significantly decreased insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity for all 3 treatment arms [28]. In contrast, another Spanish study of 41 patients with markedly increased fasting insulin levels did not find any improvements in glucose metabolism 1 year after the PI com- ponent was switched to efavirenz [13]. DYSLIPIDEMIA AFTER DISCONTINUING THE PI Lipid disorders in patients with HIV infection are complicated. HIV infection itself has been associated with an increase in the serum triglyceride level, a lowering of the total cholesterol level, and a lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level [46, 47]. Treatment with current potent regimens results in variable changes. PIs, especially ritonavir, cause a characteristic dyslip- idemia pattern with sometimes dramatic increases in triglyc- eride-rich lipoproteins. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels also increase, whereas HDL cholesterol levels rarely change [48]. Initiation of therapy with the NNRTIs, in contrast, is associated with more-modest increases in total cholesterol levels and minimal changes in fasting triglyceride levels [49]. Indeed, the HDL cholesterol level may increase with the initiation of the NNRTIs; this has been best documented with nevirapine [50]. Approximately one-half of all included studies did not measure fasting lipid values or did not specify how their lipid parameters were measured. This may be a con- founding factor, especially for the outcomes for triglyceride and LDL values. Abacavir. Three randomized, controlled trials evaluated dyslipidemia after abacavir was substituted for a PI. All showed significantly lower total cholesterol levels after a median follow- up period of 12 months, compared with levels for subjects in the PI treatment arm (mean difference, 24 mg/dL) [1, 2, 4]. Two of the 3 trials also showed significant decreases in tri- glyceride levels [1, 2]. Two abacavir-switch trials have measured HDL cholesterol levels: a randomized, controlled Swiss trial of 81 patients found no significant differences between treatment arms after 19 months [2], whereas a smaller Spanish study of 27 patients showed significantly lower values after 6 months [28]. Efavirenz. Evolving dyslipidemia after discontinuing efa- virenz was studied in 752 patients in 14 clinical trials. One- third of these studies were randomized (with a total of 366 "switched" patients). Ten efavirenz trials also included mea- surements of cholesterol subclasses. The only discernible trend after a median duration of follow-up of 12 months was elevated HDL level compared with the baseline value. This holds true both for the smaller cohorts that focused on patients with clinical lipodystrophy and for the large randomized trials. The aforementioned large multicenter study of 346 patients showed a small increase in HDL cholesterol levels in the efavirenz arm and a small decrease after 12 months in the PI arm; the dif- ference was statistically significant [8]. Eight studies (3 of which were randomized, controlled trials) measured HDL cholesterol levels; 5 of these studies showed a significant increase in the HDL cholesterol level [8, 10, 12, 15, 28], and 3 did not report significant changes [9, 13, 16]. Total cholesterol and LDL cho- lesterol values were seemingly unaffected by the switch to efa- virenz: none of the 13 trials showed any significant changes. The outcome for triglyceride levels was heterogeneous, with 11 of the 14 studies not reporting any significant changes. Nevirapine. The lipid results for nevirapine switch trials stand somewhat in the middle between those for the other 2 switch drugs. Most trials were performed with patients who were reported to have clinical lipodystrophy. Although there is a clear trend toward improvement in triglyceride levels, data on total cholesterol are conflicting. Three of 9 studies included HDL and LDL cholesterol values, and all showed significantly increased HDL values after the therapy switch [20, 28, 29]. Two randomized, controlled studies from Spain have compared cho- 1226 * CID 2002:35 (15 November) * HIV/AIDS</page><page sequence="9">lesterol and triglyceride levels [18, 19]. There were no significant differences between treatment arms (partially because of im- proving lipid values in the PI treatment arms). Three of 5 nevirapine trials, however, have shown improvement when cho- lesterol and/or triglyceride values after the switch were com- pared with baseline values [19, 21, 24]. Two other studies ob- served only trends toward improvement [18, 23]. BODY HABITUS CHANGES AFTER DISCONTINUING THE PI Alterations in fat distribution as a consequence of treatment for HIV infection have been estimated to occur in as many as 50%-60% of patients who are receiving long-term, successful ART [43, 51]. At least 2 phenotypes have been described: fat accumulation (mainly visceral fat gain, although sometimes the fat is gained at other body sites) and peripheral fat loss (es- pecially in the face and limbs). The phenotype is often mixed, although 1 component (loss or gain) tends to predominate in an individual patient. Studies of this syndrome (or syndromes) are hampered by the lack of a case definition and by the lack of uniformity measured across studies [43]. These factors lead to great difficulties in interpreting the effects of discontinuation of the PI component of therapy on body composition. Twenty-two of the 35 referenced PI-switch studies com- mented on the frequency of clinical lipodystrophy (either at baseline or during the course of the study), but most studies did not define the criteria on which this diagnosis was made. Body habitus changes after treatment switches were evaluated in 18 of 35 PI-switch studies. The most common diagnostic tools were self-report and physician's assessment, which are also the least reliable and most subject to patient and physician bias. The outcome was almost uniformly "in favor" of the switch regimen, with reported subjective improvement of the lipodystrophy syndrome. Sixteen of the 22 PI-switch studies that included data on body-shape changes included : 1 objec- tive test. The most commonly used objective methods were anthropomorphic measurements, including body-part circum- ferences, skin-fold thickness, and waist-to-hip ratio. These methods are subject to considerable observer variation because of variability in technique. Dual-energy radiographic absorp- tiometry was used in 5 studies [16, 18, 24, 25, 29]. This tech- nique is a reasonable measure of peripheral fat loss and total fat, but it cannot distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat and, thus, cannot detect changes in visceral fat accumula- tion. Only 5 studies with a total of 155 patients used the most reliable techniques for measurement of visceral fat, CT or MRI of the abdomen [11, 14, 25, 29, 30]. Given the wide variability in the definitions and methods of assessment, it is difficult to make definitive statements about the effect on fat redistribution of switching from a PI. Overall, 6 of 16 studies showed, by objective measurements, body-shape changes that were determined to be significant [10, 18, 21, 25, 29, 30]. These changes could be referred to as "moderate loss of fat," as documented by dual-energy radiographic absorp- tiometry; in some cases, this is associated with weight loss, and, in 1 case, it was associated with a gain of lean body mass. However, as noted above, the low accuracy of these tests (or, in the case of dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry scans, the ability to distinguish visceral from total abdominal fat) makes interpretation of these data difficult. Three of the 5 PI- switch studies that used quantitative methods that directly as- sess visceral fat accumulation (abdominal CT or MRI) showed trends toward reduction of visceral adipose tissue [11, 14, 30], whereas 2 failed to document any changes [25, 29]. Of im- portance, no study showed any improvement in fat loss after discontinuation of the PI component of therapy. NUCLEOSIDE-SWITCH TRIALS Cohort studies have suggested that thymidine analogue nucle- osides (particularly stavudine) might be important contributors to the development of lipoatrophy [52-55]. Nucleoside-switch trials were first initiated in 1999. All enrolled patients with lipoatrophy, many of whom were already receiving PI-free reg- imens. To date, 7 nucleoside-switch studies with a total of 350 patients (94% of whom discontinued use of stavudine) have been reported; 3 of the studies were randomized, controlled trials. The most recent and largest nucleoside-switch trial random- ized 111 Australian abacavir-naive patients with lipoatrophy to either switching the thymidine analogue component of therapy to abacavir or to continuing the previous regimen [36]. The majority of patients were taking stavudine (77%); 16% were taking zidovudine at the time of the switch. Fifty-two percent of the patients were receiving PI-containing combination ther- apy, which was not changed. Peripheral wasting, as measured by dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry and CT, improved 6 months after the switch. The mean change in the amount of limb fat was modest (an -0.39-kg increase from baseline). Of interest, there was no subjective improvement and there were no correlations between subjective severity scores and objective data. There was a trend toward decreased lactate levels, but no changes in lipid or glucose metabolism were seen. Four of these 7 nucleoside-switch studies used dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry [36-39], which is a sensitive di- agnostic tool for peripheral lipoatrophy. All of these studies confirmed that there was a modest but statistically significant gain in peripheral fat after the switch from or discontinuation of stavudine. Subjective improvement of lipoatrophy symp- toms, however, was reported only for a minority of patients (mean, 37%) [39-42]. Four of 7 studies thus far have also HIV/AIDS * CID 2002:35 (15 November) * 1227</page><page sequence="10">shown decreased lactate levels [36, 39, 40, 42]. The impact on other metabolic parameters was less clear. SUMMARY The management and understanding of ART-associated lipo- dystrophy and metabolic disturbances has become a major clin- ical concern, because as many as 60% of the patients after &gt;1 year of therapy might be affected. Since 1998, many clinical studies have investigated the evolution of ART-associated side- effects after removing the presumed causative agent, the PI. In the absence of effective therapeutic options for the disfiguring body habitus changes and dyslipidemia that many patients ex- perience, some of the switch trials were at the same time at- tempts at therapeutic intervention. These switch trials have contributed significantly to a better understanding of ART- related side-effects. Before analyzing the complex phenomena of lipid metabo- lism and body fat distribution, one should conclude that dis- continuing the PI often results in a much more convenient regimen and is overall virologically safe if the virus load has been undetectable for the past 6 months. If a switch in therapy is indicated or contemplated, patients and physicians should not be concerned about the risk of breakthrough viremia. This is particularly true for patients for whom the PI-based regimen is their first antiviral therapy. Although it is unlikely that the new regimens are more potent than PI-based treatments, they are more simple. This and the improved quality of life may contribute to the observed better long-term adherence and, thus, sustained virus suppression. In addition, discontinuing the PI component also preserves this class of agents for future use. PI-free antiretroviral regimens have the advantage of a lower potential for medication interactions. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that switching from a PI to either an NNRTI or abacavir is generally virologically safe and often results in an improved metabolic profile. It is there- fore a reasonable approach to offer to many patients. In con- trast, the virological safety of switching components (either PIs or nucleoside analogues) for nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-experienced patients or for patients whose virus is not fully suppressed remains an open question. Full interpretation of the metabolic effects of switching from a PI is difficult for many reasons. Baseline values for parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism before starting the PI were often not provided. Many patients did not have significant metabolic abnormalities while taking the PI-containing regi- men. Thus, there would be little opportunity to see benefit after switching. The NNRTI class of antiretrovirals, which are com- monly used as PI substitutes, may have a significant impact on lipid metabolism on their own [49, 50]. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend toward an improved metabolic profile when pa- tients discontinue use of the PI. This holds especially true for insulin resistance and triglyceride levels and, to a lesser degree, for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels (especiallywhen therapy is switched to include an NNRTI). It should be kept in mind that there is still no generally accepted case definition for ART-associated lipodystrophy, and little is known about the natural course of this syndrome. A plateau effect has been observed, both on an individual basis [56] and on a population basis (stable prevalence after &gt;2 years of receiving ART) [47]. Given the wide variability in methods of assessment, there is a clear bias toward overrating the impact of PIs on body habitus changes. If we focus only on studies that used the most reliable measures, there might be a trend toward reduced visceral fat. None of the PI-switch studies showed any objective evidence for reversibility of peripheral wasting. Thus, peripheral wasting might be more closely related to the nucleoside analogue components of ART, as suggested by the recent Australian stavudine/zidovudine switch trial [36]. It is noteworthy, though, that almost one-half of the patients in this study were not taking PIs at the time of the switch. On the other hand, most PI-switch studies that have involved pa- tients with clinical lipodystrophy maintained the original nu- cleoside regimen. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the development of ART-associated lipodystrophy and meta- bolic disturbances could be triggered by a combination of PIs and thymidine analogues. Although the overall improvement in limb fat levels seen in the nucleoside-switch studies was small, these trials are important proof of concept and strongly suggest a role for thymidine analogues (especially stavudine) in the pathogenesis of lipoatrophy. The virological safety of discontinuing use of nucleoside analogues is not yet well documented. Many more questions remain with regard to switching strat- egies for patients with lipodystrophy. Will metabolic abnor- malities and symptoms of lipodystrophy return to baseline levels if the PI component of therapy and stavudine are dis- continued at the same time? Is there a best time for switching ART? A small randomized switch trial comparing the effects of discontinuing PI versus stavudine versus both drugs is cur- rently underway [57]. Other studies in the future might evaluate completely nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-free reg- imens. All future trials will, it is hoped, include baseline met- abolic and body composition data and will routinely assess adherence to ART and quality of life. It is preferable that they will concentrate on patients with new metabolic disturbances seen after starting ART to determine the effectiveness of switch- ing as a therapeutic option. References 1.
