AT the time this text was written it was a very brave venture. In the late i 970s, young Soviet academics did not wisely stray outside an officially agreed predmet</page><page sequence="2">572 SEER, 8i, 3, 2003 of narrowly defined topic and period. Far less did they venture into structuralist analyses of the Soviet power system in action in any field. But Vladimir Paperny was already in his mid thirties. He had finished his industrial design training when he moved into architecture through the invitation and support of two bold mentors in the circles of history and criticism closely integrated with, and initially somewhat protected by, central groups in the Union of Architects. Their protege was frustrated, as he recounts here, by the refusal of those who had pioneered research into the avant-garde of the 1920S to seek real explanation of how and why 'Soviet architecture went in a different direction' in the thirties (p. xvii). He refused to accept the euphemism 'for reasons everyone is aware of' (ibid.) and plunged into the archives and period journals to find reasons for himself. Though no one mentions it here, the resulting dissertation entitled 'Soviet architecture I932-54' was not defended in I980 'for political reasons'. But he emigrated to the USA a year later and the manuscript was soon being proffered for publication in Russian (which Ardis, Ann Arbor, MI, did in I985 as Kul'tura 'Dva') and for translation, which we finally have here. The translation is exemplary: readable but accurate. Occasionally signific- ant phrases are lost, however. Notably absent from this opening account of his frustrations is the phrase 'for someone of my generation' (Ardis edition, p. 9), because the generational relationships are crucial here. Typically the young would not perhaps could not recognize the equal courage needed by their predecessors, against whom he railed, in tackling the 1920s. Of course they were irritatingly cautious. But Paperny's fault was over- reaction. He assembles detail so eclectically that the result is something which, I fear, few can read as more than an evocative journey through a looking glass. Names are poured out on the assumption that his readers know the scene as well as him. Amidst strong and salient themes, others are pursued with equal emphasis that are flimsy and worthy only of a student essay. The text needed serious editing to make a historic document into a book. On the other hand, as I mention, small contextual indicators have been removed which prevent it being self-explanatory as a period piece of dissident writing. For Boris Groys, who writes a Foreword here, it read in 1979 'like breathing fresh air in the stale intellectual atmosphere of Moscow at that time' (p. xv) and he soon left to pursue similar themes in Germany. But, I fear that social historians now will find the analyses naive and architectural historians will get lost among the side-topics as 'evidence' is adduced, often very selectively, from every other aspect of Soviet life and numerous periods of Russian history. Paperny's basic thesis is that 'the twenties' and 'Stalinism' (or in aesthetic terms Modernism and Socialist Realism) represent two models of culture which he labels One and Two. One is 'horizontal': it genuinely seeks to draw on the contributions of individuals, even if it censors the results. Two is 'vertical': 'truth' emanates from the top and individuals exist only to write what is required, or in this case, design to specification. The driving paradigms of One are technology and its mechanical logic; of Two, the biological and anthropomorphic: not technique and process but holisms and myths. In one of his clearer and more rewarding sections he shows how in One, every art</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 573 sought to find its own essence and inherent laws whilst in Two, all arts are but 'illustrations' of the same (as he sees it) verbally conceived narrative and the sublime work is a synthesis. It communicates to 'the masses' with total transparency because all its component 'voices' are speaking that same mythic story in harmony. There are important archival exposes here of the cynical political manipula- tions around architecture, but they drown in the trivia. Conversely there is no positive discussion of architectural theory, though within international debates about 'using history' in architecture they were unusually rich. Here too the work is moulded by its hermetic origins and over-dominated by the abstract polarities such as 'Beginning-Ending', 'Improvisation-Notation', 'Business- Miracle', which form his sectional themes. I was shocked initially by the carelessness which allowed the world's best- known architectural commentator of the last thirty years, Charles Jencks, to be spot-lit in the first two words of page I in the half-Russian spelling 'Jenks'. Clearly no-one related to architecture had checked these proofs. I now realize that was a Culture-One reaction. For Culture Two this is a crucial signifier that despite its smart Western clothes, this text is indeed a time capsule from another country. As that it remains a challenging contribution from which much other research could follow. Department of Design &amp; Innovation CATHERINE COOKE The Open University</page></plain_text>
