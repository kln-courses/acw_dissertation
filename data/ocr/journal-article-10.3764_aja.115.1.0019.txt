Is their corpulence merely a symptom of regional  style, or may it carry social significance? The terms  “symposion” and “sympotic” here refer to the social  institution of elite, predominantly male gatherings  centering on the ritualized consumption of wine. It  is suggested that this distinctive figure type served as a  vehicle of self-expression for elite Ionians in the sixth  century and illuminates the sympotic aspects of sanc- tuary feasting in archaic Ionia. These sculptures chal- lenge the traditional dichotomy between cultic and  domestic banqueting and may reflect a time before  such a distinction became important, when symposia  could take place not only in private homes but also  in sanctuary spaces. the geneleos group The earliest example of this figure type is -arches,  the nearly life-sized reclining figure in the Geneleos  Group from Samos (see figs. 1–3; cat. no. 1).6 Its plinth  occupied the rightmost position on a long base for a Fig. 2.

Reclining banqueters are also found among ar- chaic Cypriot limestone votive statuettes and statuette  groups, from Cyprus and some East Greek sanctuaries  (fig. 22).50 Those from Samos and Lindos have been  dated to the first half of the sixth century, contempo- rary with the earliest Ionian sculpted banqueters.51  They share with the Ionian sculptures the basic re- clining pose (which Fehr dubs the “östliches Liege- schema,” with legs laid flat, to be distinguished from  the “western” scheme with one knee raised)52 and  lack of banqueting furniture, but they differ in style,  placement of the left hand (usually resting on a pil- low rather than holding a drinking vessel), and the  frequent inclusion of a woman seated on the hip of  the reclining man.
