This is  a charity fund- raising event organized by the Lions Club over the spring  bank holiday. I observed the event in 2009 and 2010 and participated  in it in 2011. Originally the aim of the competition was to build the tall- est tower of pebbles in two hours and the event was for children. Since  they were helped by adults anyway, it became a family or group event   and now people of all ages participate. Since 2005 there has also been a  pebble design or art competition that has become increasingly popular.  In the 2010 and 2011 competitions only three and four groups respect- ively, all of whom were local families, built pebble towers. The rest of  the entries were pebble designs of various kinds. All the materials have  to be collected on the beach: principally pebbles, but some designs  are enhanced with driftwood and seaweed. Some groups frame their  designs with rows of pebbles forming a border. Many of them are directly  inspired by the experience of the seaside and beach holidays: mermaids,  ice- cream cones, octopuses, boats, lighthouses, beach huts, fish, crabs.  Other designs are quite eclectic, including, over the years, a giraffe, a   snake, guitar, a butterfly (Figures 16.1– 16.4).  Up to 500 people have taken part, both local families and visitors.  The 2011 competition was less well attended as a result of cold and wet  weather. That day there were around 100 participants with 4 tower-  building groups and 17 constructing designs. Most groups consisted of  four to six people spanning all generations. One consisted of teenage  428 </page> <page sequence="2"> 429   Figure 16.1 A pebble tower (Source: author) boys who made a guitar. Some families had actually planned their design  on paper and in advance and knew exactly what they were going to do.  They had a rough idea of how many black, yellow, red, brown, etc. peb- bles they would need. Other groups spontaneously thought up what they  were going to do on the spot. Most of the time was spent by people wan- dering up and down the beach collecting pebbles of different colours, in  buckets or carrier bags, heads down, grandmothers and mothers helping  children. In different groups some members stayed put and constructed  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 429 </page> <page sequence="3"> 430 431   Figure 16.2 Beach huts (Source: author) the design with the materials brought to them. One group of tower build- ers had brought garden spades to dig a moat around their tower. The  lower parts are built as a cairn. The upper parts, or spires, require an  ingenious and delicate balancing act in which very small pebbles col- lected along the tide line are used to balance and prop up larger pebbles.  Building these towers required much vigorous work and skill. Black and yellow were the predominant colours used in some   designs, often with white pebbles being used as an enhancing or framing  device. It was usually the ordinary-c oloured plain pebbles that people   collected in order to create contrast and pattern in their designs. The  intricate, multicoloured ‘special’ beach pebbles were always grouped  together when used to create a strong design. The contestants wetted  their pebbles just before the judges came to see them in order to enhance  the vibrancy of their colours. This production of pebble designs on the  beach has also stimulated the work of dedicated pebble artists producing   outstanding work (Figure 16.5).    This practice of making patterns and designs out of pebbles has, as  we have seen, its roots in the Bronze Age. It is part of a 4,000-y ear story  of pebble use. The contemporary beach pebble crab finds its prehistoric   parallel in a Middle Bronze Age pebble sculpture depicting a double axe.   430 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="4"> 431   Figure 16.3 Lighthouse (Source: author) The manner in which people respond to pebbles in the past or the present  depends on their relationship with them, their meaning and value.  In the longue durée pebbles have always had a certain practical util- ity as building stone, beginning with the construction of Bronze Age peb- ble cairns and continuing today in their ornamental use to build paths,   walls, gutters, etc. Today they are also quarried and crushed for utilitar-  ian use as hard-w earing roadstone. The crushing of pebbles destroys their  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 431 </page> <page sequence="5"> 432   Figure 16.4 Crab (Source: author)   Figure 16.5 Balloon and bird by beach artist (Source: author) 432 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="6"> 43 integrity of form. The processed material bears no relationship to the ori- ginal form, a complete material transformation. This crushing of pebbles  also has its origins in the Bronze Age. The transformation of the pebbles   taking place at Jacob’s Well that reduced them to grit and drained them  of their colours was, however, something that was undertaken because  of their symbolic value rather than their functional use value, but had a  similar transformational material effect. To the farmer with fields in the vicinity of the Pebblebed heathlands  the pebbles can wreck a plough and are unwanted material. They may be  a curse or a blessing to gardeners, making digging difficult but also pro-  viding ready- to- hand materials for creative work. For the Royal Marines  they silently perform excellent work in hardening and strengthening  the body of the recruit: out of pebbles the desired military body can be  formed.  For both artists and tourists alike they provide a medium for crea- tive thought: individual pebbles have their aesthetics and personalities.  This again is a response that we can trace back to the Bronze Age. For  archaeologists pebbles provide a medium through which it becomes pos- sible to rethink the past in the present in new kinds of ways. All these  are variant forms of collective memory work: pebbles encapsulate and  invoke experiences, relationships, events, persons and places. Doing things with pebbles, bodily engaging with their forms, cre- ates an intimate involvement with them. The archaeological excavation  team spent many months touching and handling and moving pebbles.  In a very real sense this was prehistoric work in reverse. The team were  dismantling with considerable care cairns that had been constructed  4,000  years ago. They were touching and being touched by precisely  the same materials. They were sorting, grading and classifying pebbles.  When I talked to people who were building things with pebbles in their  gardens it was evident that exactly the same kind of bodily intimacy  arose. From this intimate bodily involvement with pebbled materials  pebble speech arises. The excavation team were always talking about  pebbles, as were people who were building and doing things with peb- bles in their gardens. Such speech does not arise in the abstract but from  intimate sensory contact, speech generated through and of the body. People today curate and collect and display pebbles in their homes.  The materiality of their forms and colours and patterns is generative of  such a response. This again is an embodied relation articulated most  powerfully perhaps in the work of artists such as Priscilla Trenchard and  her work with pebbles, which she discusses in Chapter 15. A contempor- ary response such as this is a mirror image of a prehistoric relationship  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 433 </page> <page sequence="7"> 43 with pebbles. Prehistory is in and of the present. It still exists in our  embodied minds. We still think like Bronze Age people because, like  them, we engage with the same materials from which the same kinds of  pebble thought arises. Of course the modern beach ice- cream cone has  an altogether different meaning and significance from that of the prehis- toric pebble axe. What things mean or signify is always subject to often  rapid historical change. It is a kind of gloss of history and is always rad- ically open to interpretation and reinterpretation. New presents in this  manner create new pasts that wear new clothes, but the garments in  which the past becomes contemporarily adorned cover the same body.  The aesthetic appreciation of a pebble today is a very different matter  from the manner in which such a thing would have been thought through  in the Bronze Age. This is always a matter of signification and the con- textual relationships out of which signification takes place. However, the  modern and prehistoric attitudes to pebbles both arise from the same  embodied response: the visual touch or power of the thing in itself, in its  material Being in the world that entraps us in the same entangled web. All the various responses to pebbles arise from their material pres- ence and varying modes of engagement and interest in them and in  particular the hardness and durability of these stones, their sensuous  and tactile rounded forms, their varied colours and intricate patterns.  Pebbles are perfect stones in that they are ready- mades. They do not  require fabrication. Pebbles are like people: each one is different from  the other and yet they are still all the same. The empty eyes that stare out  at us from some of the pebbles (Figure 5.6) engage with our own eyes.  They look at us and we respond to them. This is, of course, to produce  a philosophy and a world out of the thing: an entire human sensibility   running through the longue durée is to be found in a pebble, while in this   longue durée there exists a variety of different responses and manner of  uses for which pebbles are employed. That in my view might be a general  aim of a prehistory linking past to present. Although this account has stressed the multiple uses, meanings and  values associated with pebbles, this does not entail they can mean any- thing. An embodied relationship with pebbles in the past and the present  suggests something quite different: we are entrapped and constrained by  their pebble materiality. I walk along the beach, pick up a pebble that  I find intriguing and pocket it. The response is both repetitive and habit- ual, it belongs to pre- discursive thought, requires no reasoning or cal- culation. The pebble feels comforting, its brightness demands attention.  This is the enchantment of the pebble and its visceral effect. I want to   possess this perfect thing. Gell (1992a) has written of the enchantment  434 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="8"> 435 of technology and the technology of enchantment:  we are bewitched  and bedazzled by the thing because we cannot comprehend how it was   made. The pebble, we might say, enchants us in precisely the reverse way.  Its power resides in the fact that it has not been made, owes nothing to  humanity. In this respect the pebble enchants through its naturalness. Pebbles speak of the past and the present in a material language  unmatched by any other kind of stone. Cultural technologies of enchant- ment are always of their time. They always fall out of utility and become  drained of their original meaning and significance through the passage  of time. By contrast, a pebble is out of time because it responds to an  embodied pre- objective mind that requires no conscious thought. In  other words, the pebble is thought through the body rather than the  mind. The power of the pebble resides precisely in its unnatural natural- ness or its perfection in relation to other kinds of stone. It is self-s ufficient,  contained within its own pebbly being or essence. It does not need to be   made and therefore has an excess of materiality. To paraphrase Rowlands  (2005), the pebble has more materiality than any other kind of stone. This  natural material excess is what has stimulated a similar human response  over 4,000 years. Making anything out of a pebble can only destroy its  natural ready-m ade perfection. It enchants through its very denial of the  possibility of technological enhancement. Other kinds of stone can be  improved by technology to suit human purposes but the pebble remains  aloof from such a technological transformative desire. What do pebbles really want of us? They invite us to gather and  collect them, arrange them in patterns, create new sculptural forms,  respond to their material excess in new ways. This is the thread that  reminds us that our contemporary embodied thought is pre-m odern and  something that we directly share with the people of the Bronze Age. Our  present is coeval with their past.  Lévi- Strauss (1966) was correct when he maintained that savage  thought still persists in our technologically dominated modernity. It is  just that he posited this in the wrong kind of way. For him it persisted  in the unchanging nature of the structure of a human mind divorced  from the body: thought dematerialized. Thinking through thought in a  material manner leads us to the opposite conclusion. Our thought is still  ‘savage’ because it is thought through the interiority of the body, distinct  from intention and only accessible through reflection on the logic of prac-  tice binding together people and things. The materiality of the pebble  is its otherness, that it is indifferent to our will. Its natural materiality  nevertheless exerts its own particular kind of agency that is very different  from the agency of humanly created things because it is not made to do  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 435 </page> <page sequence="9"> 436 anything, unlike a technical device designed with a purpose. It just exists,   has its own being.  This may be contrasted with Latour’s discussion of technological  things such as a speed bump that is ‘not made of matter, ultimately; it  is full of engineers and chancellors and lawmakers, commingling their  wills and their story lines with those of gravel, concrete, paint and stand- ard calculations ... where some, though not all, of the characteristics of  policemen become speed bumps’ (Latour 1994: 41). In the speed bump  example the object and person commingle as parts of interlinked net- works that form part of each other, linking humans and non- humans. It  is the thought and intentionality that goes into the making of the speed   bump that for Latour is the essence of its semi- human agency as a quasi-  subject. Again this perspective privileges the thought in the thing, and  in our technologically dominated modernity we increasingly interact  almost solely with technical or cultural rather than natural things. An  enormous amount of my time and that of millions of others is today spent  engaging with a keyboard and computer screen. This is engagement with  a designed object, the end process of human thought. But things that  are not artefacts have no thought in them, they are entirely free of this  human involvement in their creation and there is no correspondence here  between language and things except in terms of their representation. From an embodied perspective, engaging with a pebble or a host of  other natural things – trees, animals, hills, bogs – requires not a consid- eration of the thinking mind of intentionality that resides within a thing  but a pre- objective bodily engagement with the thing that is of an entirely  different order, involving bodily agency, a sensuous carnal relation that  ends in objects rather than beginning in thoughts.  The pebbled landscape in the longue durée What pebbles mean at any particular time to people is more than simply  a question of material identities. It involves taking the idea of material  worlds, as seriously as social worlds, where people create themselves in  these material worlds in terms of different temporalities, and transmit  identity and culture over time through cultural signification on the one  hand and human embodiment on the other. What is important is not only  ideas of cultural transmission from one generation to the next and how  this involves memory, remembering or forgetting, but also the embodied  and habitual relations through which people live out their lives in rela- tion to their material worlds. 436 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="10"> 437  This heathland landscape of pebbles exhibits obvious long- term  continuity in an economic sense. This is a humanly created landscape  born out of woodland clearance and fire and maintained through the  continued agency of fire and by grazing animals. It has always been this   way. Rituals of fire first associated with the construction of the Early  Bronze Age pebble cairns continuing in the pebble- crushing rites at  Jacob’s Well in the Middle Bronze Age also survived in variant forms  well into modernity (Chapters 3, 6 and 12). Human engagement with  the heath has only very recently changed, on the very cusp of history,  from a taskscape from which one made a meagre living into a pleasured  leisurescape. The heath has always been a marginal landscape. Today it is not  easy to imagine oneself living in what is a gnarled, sparse and unpro- tected heathland. The soil is poor, thin and acidic; the vegetation is acrid.  This has always been a poor place to live, a place where the marginalized,  the vulnerable, would have been pushed out to. You would only live up  here if you couldn’t live somewhere else and that is the way it has always  been since the Bronze Age. This is in part about temporality in an ecologi- cal sense, the enduring qualities of this landscape.  But the history of the heath in the longue durée is more nuanced  than that. From the Bronze Age onwards it was an integrated and valued  part of a broader regional economy (see Chapters 8, 10 and 12). It was  only in modernity that the heathland gradually became increasingly eco- nomically redundant if it resisted being transformed into farmland. This  redundancy led to its adoption for an entirely different and new use: for  military occupation and training, a short- term temporal cycle in the use  of the heathland that has continued to the present. An even shorter-t erm  temporal cycle has been the valuing of the heath as a conservation site, a  cultural landscape worth preserving for posterity. The conception of the heathland as redundant had other conse- quences in relation to how the past became understood and incorporated  into the present. The visible presence of prehistoric monuments, linger- ing relics of the past in a landscape now out of time, became romanti-  cized. Landscaping the heathlands by constructing modern versions of  prehistoric mounds, but in the right places rather than the wrong places  in the heathland landscape, served to make the presence of a pagan pre- historic past more redolent and powerful. At the same time the heath  itself, rather than being considered as being of the present and part of  an integrated regional economy, became a fossilized past that could be  contrasted with a present landscape of Christian well-t illed fields and a  demure landscape garden (Chapter 10). A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 437 </page> <page sequence="11"> 438 People created this heathland world and subsequent generations  have inherited it and transmitted it to future generations. The heath itself  is a combination of shorter- and longer- term temporalities in the details  of its use and maintenance that shape the people who use it but within   which people shape the future. The Bronze Age pebble cairns and peb- ble platforms are part and parcel of a human sculpting of the landscape  in which memory, commemoration and marking come to the fore. This  sculpting of the landscape then assumes a massive and unprecedented   scale during the Iron Age and the construction of Woodbury Castle. In  the sheer monumental scale of that earthwork the individual pebble  entirely loses its significance.  In the Neolithic pebbles are taken from the heathland and depos- ited at hilltop enclosures in its vicinity from whose vantage points one  could look down and across the heathland. The light oak/ hazel forest  that grew there looked significantly different from the dense forests that  surrounded it. The light Pebblebed woodlands provided excellent oppor- tunities for hunting and gathering. Taking pebbles away from this area  seems to have ended in the Early Bronze Age with the construction of  small pebble cairns. The pebbles were now collected and used on the  heathlands themselves. However, this temporal rhythm and practice of  curating pebbles and taking them away to settlements elsewhere emerges   once more in the Iron Age with the pebble depositions at Hembury hill- fort. After that it disappears entirely until modernity, when pebbles once  more are used as ‘rustic’ building material at Killerton House, Bicton  Gardens and elsewhere, continuing into the twentieth century in their  use to decorate motorway bridges (Chapter 13).  In the Bronze Age there exists a long-t erm temporal cycle or rhythm  in which the appreciation of individual pebbles and their colours and  sculpting them plays a key role. From small beginnings in discreet peb- ble cairns associated with fire rituals, rather than burials, much larger  monuments are constructed at high points in the landscape, with com- plex mortuary rites taking place involving probably the excarnation of   bodies on elaborately sculpted pebble platforms. The inalienable pebble   wealth of these communities was elaborately put on display, and in the  Jacob’s Well burnt mound the pebbles met a symbolic death (Chapter 7).  Thereafter from the Late Bronze Age c. 1300 BC pebbles lost this embod- ied symbolic significance. During the Earlier Bronze Age the effects of  human activities on the heathlands had exposed more and more of the  pebbles from under its mantle of light sandy soil. There was an inflation- ary spiral in the use of more and more pebbles, and a rupture occurred  in which they became no longer regarded as intrinsically valuable stones.  438 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="12"> 439 Peat development on the heathlands then swallowed them up and once  more returned them to the earth (Chapter 8).  The Bronze Age embodied way of doing things with, and thinking  through, pebbles emerges once more in twentieth-c entury modernity,   having slumbered for over 2,000 years. It is the same historical mediation  of embodied materiality. The essentially spiritual qualities of pebbles  have emerged once again in the present and in the aesthetic responses  to them by artists and others who use them, build things out of them  and respond to their materiality in new and unexpected ways. They have  become, as in the Bronze Age past, a powerful medium for contempla-  tion and embodied creative thought. More broadly Trenchard’s engage- ment with the heathland landscape that she discusses in Chapter 15  involves much more than the pebbles and emerges from other aspects of  its embodied materiality, its vegetation and soils.  Hardy, discussed in Chapter 12, characterizes heathland in a thor-  oughly anthropomorphic manner. The heathland is a body, a brooding  and dark material presence in which people eke out a miserable living. It  simultaneously repels and attracts, it has its moods and different faces.  It is above all a landscape out of time, or a timeless landscape, because it   has existed for so long. This anthropomorphic conceptualization of heath  as body and the bodies of persons being born out of it is another manifes- tation of embodied prehistoric thought. There is little doubt that the peo- ple of the Bronze Age would have thought in a similar way to Hardy: this  was an animate landscape peopled with ancestral forces, explained and  understood in terms of mythological understandings of how the world  came into being (Chapter 6). The timelessness of this landscape in the sense of a linear tempo-  rality of days and dates is itself part of the distinctive longue durée of  a heathland landscape materially contrasting with the shifting patterns   of fields with their seasonally textured crops around it. Hardy’s heath  is a consciousness without intentionality and it weighs down, as Marx  remarks history does, like a nightmare on the brain of the living. The  heath is a kind of nightmare because one cannot escape it and it always  makes its presence felt through the body.  Hardy describes the incipient heathland paths felt through the feet.  Such paths felt in precisely this way criss-c ross the Pebblebed heaths  today as they did in the prehistoric past. Similarly, where they are fully  exposed on the surface the voices of the pebbles ring out as I and others  walk on them. These same pebbles tire the Royal Marines just as they  tired Bronze Age bodies. I hear pebble voices as I follow the tracks. All the  time, while doing so, I am walking in the past in the present: the Bronze  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 439 </page> <page sequence="13"> 40 Age tracks become my tracks and I hear the same pebble voices. When I  look out and across this same landscape I see the same hills and valleys  and so the distant past becomes my present. I smell the heathland vegeta- tion as it was once smelled, the same plants still persist and therefore my  body, situated in modernity, simultaneously embodies both the past and   the present, as do the bodies of others. This is part of the longue durée of  this landscape, a historical temporal rhythm that transcends the lifespans  of individuals and generations, in which the present shares the same time   with both the historic and the prehistoric past.  A theory of things or a theory of kinds of thing?  One goal of archaeology and of wider material culture studies has been  to attempt to produce a theory of things. I myself have long wished to  produce such a general theory of things. My closest specific attempt  was the book Metaphor and Material Culture (Tilley 1999), which put  forward a theory of material culture as a matter of material metaphor.  The end result was not all that satisfactory, because it could never be  comprehensive. In fact it was a failure in terms of providing a general  theory of things. It perhaps emphasized only one aspect of such a theory.  I have now come to the conclusion that any attempt to produce a theory  of things in general will always end in frustration and misery, at least for  the theorist. Ultimately it is a manic totalitarian desire to pin down the  entire material world and stabilize it. I want to explain why a general  theory of things is impossible by examining two of the very best recent  attempts.  Hodder has recently made a valiant attempt to provide a general  theory of things revolving round a nexus of ‘entanglements’ or relation- ships. These are human–t hing relationships, thing– thing relationships,  thing– human relationships and human–h uman relationships (Hodder  2012: 88). Such a scheme has a high degree of analytical abstraction and  aims to stress a certain symmetry between person– thing relationships. However, internal thing–t hing relationships are not at all of the  same order as relationships between persons and things. A  theory of  internal relationships between things has little or no anthropological  significance. It tells us hardly anything of interest about relationships  between people and things that I  believe to be at the core of material  culture studies. Hodder’s discussions of thing– thing relationships appear  to be a thinly veiled form of functionalism, for example a self- assembly  bookcase requires screws to hold it up, a car depends on its numerous  440 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="14"> 41 parts in order to work and so on. Furthermore all the examples of things  that Hodder gives are artefacts. He has little space within his theory for  natural things. The category human–h uman relationships is curious in that it  excludes things as being of primary significance and parallels some per-  spectives in social and cultural anthropology in which the significance of  material culture always gets downplayed as of secondary or no signifi- cance when compared with a study of social and political relationships.  Interestingly, Hodder has no separate discussion of human– human rela- tionships at all in the book, apart from the fact that they are apparently  entangled with things in various ways, effectively making the category  obsolete as part of his generalized analytical scheme. Hodder illustrates thing–h uman and human– thing relationships by   using ‘tanglegrams’. These bear an uncanny relationship to the kinds of  diagrams used in functionalist systems theories approaches in archaeol- ogy in the 1970s that have long since been discredited. Arrows connect  various entities together in various relationships of dependency involv- ing considerations of how people depend on things and things depend on  persons for their production, maintenance and care. The tanglegrams are admittedly far more ‘romantic’ than ‘classical’  in form, with various sweeping, curving and looping lines linking entities  together rather than the straight lines neatly connecting boxes in systems  theory models. There are no hierarchies in such entangled relationships,   so, for example, a diagram of clay entanglements at Çatalhöyük involves  both landscape and eggs, human heads and dry land, wetland and bone  (Hodder 2012: fig. 9.2). He conceptually boxes radically different kinds  of things that are of no equivalent status (a landscape surely contains  eggs and humans within it?) in order to ‘tangle’ them back together by  drawing a sweeping line between the two. The conceptual boxes always  precede the entanglement and seem arbitrary in that there could be so   many more or far fewer.  Let us imagine another kind of ‘tanglegram’ of a prehistoric peb-  ble cairn. All the thousands of pebbles might have lines drawn between  them or we might include only ‘special’ pebbles. Then we might tangle  up everything else found in the cairn with other kinds of things and with  the pebbles themselves. The resulting density of the mass of entangle- ments would ultimately produce a dark circle or, depending on the way  you look at it, a black hole – hardly an adequate representation of the  materiality of the cairn and its contents. What does the blackness of the  entangled void ultimately tell us? I do not think it necessary to answer  this purely rhetorical question. A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 441 </page> <page sequence="15"> 42 Ultimately the complexity of all these links, threads or entangled  chains between flows of matter, energy and information, as they are  referred to in various places in Hodder’s book, creates a morass of tan- gles. Some links and entities are more important than others, which  are ultimately trivial, but in the ‘entanglement’ everything in principle  becomes important. One alternative common view of what makes a good  general theory is that it simplifies things to make relationships clearer. It  does not attempt to enmesh the world within itself like Borges’s impossi- ble map that attempts to be so faithful to the material world in its exacti- tude that it covers and envelops it (Borges 1999).  Olsen in his book In Defense of Things (2010) promises us an ‘ontol- ogy of objects’ on the cover. The title is rather odd as I don’t think things  really need defending; they are, after all, quite happy being left to them- selves. But what Olsen is really defending is one of the primary dis- ciplines studying things, archaeology, against the threat that it should  be ignored or marginalized by anthropological and social science per- spectives on things that, according to him, don’t take them sufficiently  seriously. To study things in themselves is of grave consequence, and   a discipline of archaeology ought to be superior to all others in this  respect. Thus the role of the archaeologist is valorized. In contrast, I  have always felt that archaeology should dissolve its disciplinary con- finement and that it never has had, or will have, a distinctive take on the  world of things. Olsen’s book runs through a whole series of ways in which things  have been theorized, primarily structuralist and post- structuralist, actor-  network and phenomenological approaches, and more broadly a gamut  of anthropological theories and historical perspectives stressing social  memory. Interestingly enough none of these perspectives have them- selves emerged from within an archaeological discipline of things, but  insights from them have instead been adapted by archaeologists such as  Olsen for their own purposes. Olsen’s book is a rich and sophisticated   discussion and undoubtedly the best critical survey available. But where  does it and the precious archaeological discipline of things that requires  defending take us? In the conclusion, which has the same title as the book, we learn  that all these reviewed attempts to understand things remain unsatisfac- tory: something more is required. So why and how are things significant?  Olsen’s first conclusion is to tell us that things are not a homogeneous  category but incredibly diverse. They may be big or small, have differ- ent colours, be hard or soft, have specialized functions or be multifunc- tional, have different uses. So ‘rather than thinking of them as produced  442 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="16"> 43 in [human] relations, we may think of them as what makes relations   possible’ (Olsen 2010: 157). This is in part to do with their material  properties. You can perform tasks with obsidian that you can’t do with  paint or others by using oak wood rather than birch wood. We can use  some things to move around in, such as a car, or we can transport a thing  around, such as an axe, in our hands. But different kinds of things can  also have shared material properties (158). Finally, because of their very   materiality, things last longer than words or gestures. The second point is that things are in place. My bed does not run  into the garden during the middle of the night but stays where it is. There  is a relative stability in a world of things and things are usually within  reach if we want them. They give people reassurance, succour and secu-  rity, and this is, according to Olsen, the most important statement one  can make about things: in things we trust. In terms of history and consciousness of the past in the present,  things can have multiple and diverse effects and through the appearance  of new and different things we can recognize historical change and con- tinuity; both, rather than being opposed, run in tandem. Things them- selves change: antique furniture has a patina of age. Other aspects of  things don’t really change: the knifely qualities of the knife or its human  affordances persist largely irrespective of changes in fashion and design  as do the shoely qualities of shoes (165). Because of the very materiality of things, traces are left even when  they are discarded, destroyed or demolished. Concomitantly all his- tory, through deeply considering things rather than being linear or bio- graphical in character, is instead topological and accumulative, where  the remnants of the past in the present serve as a kind of ‘involuntary  memory’ (170). These conclusions to a text running to 173 pages strike me as some- what disappointing – that the sophisticated discussions in the previous  chapters should lead to this result. This would certainly seem to encour- age those cynics who think that theorization is pretty much a waste of  time, achieving virtually nothing at the end of the day and what really  matters in a study of the past is amassing loads of new evidence and  material facts. That conclusion would be most unfortunate.  Olsen’s failure was built into his project from the very start. Like  Hodder, he wants to include within a theory of things everything from  eggs to motorway bridges, landscapes to crisp packets, beer cans to  pyramids. It simply can’t be done. And again, like Hodder, all the exam- ples actually discussed rather than mentioned are cultural objects  –  boats, fridges, shoes, decaying houses and rusting cars. The general  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 443 </page> <page sequence="17"> 4 position that Olsen advocates in his conclusions are overwhelmingly  Heideggerian in tone and inspiration, with some nods and winks along  the way to Walter Benjamin’s materialist thoughts about the significance  of fragments and ruins from the past (Benjamin 2002, 2003). The basis  for justifying a discipline of things – archaeology – becomes a form of  Marxist, existentialist and phenomenological thought and I am not in  disagreement about that. However, I have consistently argued over at least the last 20 years  (e.g. Miller and Tilley 1996) that the fulcrum of a study of things resides   in a study of material culture: materials contextualized within culture,  as part of culture. That requires primacy being given to the social rela- tions within which things are embedded and form a part. At the heart  of this is theorizing person– thing cultural relations. It is of necessity an  anthropological theory and almost all of what we know about prehistoric  things actually comes from anthropological observation and theoriza- tion of person– thing relations. Archaeologists cannot do this because  while they have things to discuss there are no persons to observe or tell  them anything, except, of course, in the important sub- field of so- called  ‘ethnoarchaeology’ (e.g. Gould 1978; David 2001). There is always a relation of asymmetry here and not the ‘symmet-  rical’ approach that both Hodder and Olsen argue for in various ways,  in which things are regarded as having some kind of equal status with  people, the pretence that things and people and their thoughts and the  meanings they give to things are of equal status. This stems ultimately  from a ventriloquist’s treatment of non-h uman objects as quasi-h uman   subjects. If we turn again to the notion of embodiment, which Olsen  readily acknowledges is of fundamental significance, we can note that  while people can have embodied relations with things, those things  themselves lack human bodies and cannot have embodied relations with  persons. Archaeologists, in fact, without theorizing it, have long under- stood the significance of embodied relations. This occurs within another  archaeological sub- field, ‘experimental archaeology’:  the attempt to  learn about the past in the present by engaging with things in the same  kind of embodied way: by making a flint tool, grinding an axe, building  a round house, making a pot or casting a bronze tool (e.g. Coles 1973;  Millson 2011). The results of most such experiments have unfortunately  been discussed only in terms of a rather limited understanding of prac- tical aspects of technology or of the functional use of things. However,  there is a much broader philosophical and theoretical understanding of   embodied material relations waiting to be drawn out of them. 444 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="18"> 45 The category of things themselves does not exist insofar as the entire  notion of what a thing is supposed to be is entirely dependent on people,  without whom there would be no world of things. Things do not think  themselves as things, but people decide what the things are. We know   from countless anthropologies that the category of the thing is cultur- ally relative, or in other words different cultures recognize things as being  things in different ways and this is highly selective. For example, animals  may be regarded as things or they may be subjects (Descola 2013b), and  ‘biographical objects’ considered in space- time (Hoskins 1998; Munn  1986) may be treated as if they were persons with their own narrative  histories. Cultures give birth to things that they subsequently manipulate  and transmit to future generations. The things themselves emerge from  a pre- objective consciousness or interaction of persons within a distinct- ive cultural world. In short, for a thing to become a thing it needs to be   categorized and socially recognized as such.  Objectification and subjectification  One of the most influential general perspectives that we have to under- stand the significance of the materiality of things is the objectification  perspective provided by Marx, developed in anthropology by Bourdieu  (1977) and elaborated in relation to material culture studies by Miller  (Miller 1987, 1994, 2010 and see critical discussion and review in Tilley  2006). Broadly the position is as follows. Through making and using and  exchanging and living with things, people make themselves and their  identities in the process. They come to know who they are through their  contact with and involvement in a world of things that both frame and  serve to structure both individual and social experience. The approach  explicitly dismisses any traditional dichotomy between subjects and   objects, which instead are considered in dialectical relation. Material   culture is thus inseparable from culture in general or human society. It  is the very medium through which people create themselves and think  themselves.  Hodder (2012: 32– 4) briefly discusses objectification but produces  no critique. In fact it informs his considerations of both ‘human– thing’   and ‘thing–h uman’ relations while not being explicitly discussed. Olsen’s  primary criticisms of this position are (a) that Miller himself primarily  studied modern consumption patterns and the appropriation of things  rather than prehistoric things that would presumably be preferable; (b)  the general perspective insufficiently considers the way people live with  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 445 </page> <page sequence="19"> 46 things; and (c) the stuff that was studied was not sufficiently dull and  ordinary (Olsen 2010: 32– 4)! These we might say are ‘practical’ rather than intellectual criti- cisms. What Olsen considers interesting, for example shopping, is a dull  and tired routine for many. As for living with things, a major component  of such studies has been the consideration of houses and their furnish- ings, more broadly domestic space (see articles in the Journal of Material  Culture from 1996 onwards).  Subjectification processes  In general, all studies of objectification processes have put primary  emphasis on the relationship between people and artefacts  – made  things. In modern consumption studies what has been of primary inter- est is the manner in which people creatively appropriate these things in  their lives and thus overcome their intrinsic alienation from a world of  ready- made things whose conditions of production are obscured and  make them their own. The primary emphasis has been on the way things  are cognized or thought through either consciously, or tacitly through   the rhythms of daily life. There has been insufficient attention in material culture studies  to natural things (things that have not been made) and embodied sen- sual relations with these things. As regards these relations, I have been  concerned to stress that the material properties of things make people  subject to them. They are entrapped by the thing in itself that exists for  itself. They cannot either think through such a thing in any way they like  or do anything they like with it. Moreover, these sensual and material  engagements with the thing come to the surface and then vanish in the   longue durée, only to reappear again in the same manner according to  the way in which people sensually engage with the things through their  bodies within time. Furthermore there is no intrinsic alienation in rela- tion to such natural things, precisely because these things are not made,  but found, and occupy the same material landscape that people inhabit.  People and pebbles and landscapes commingle, they are in and of each  other. Finding or using a natural thing is different from an act of making,  but both bring forth things into the world that become objects of atten- tion. If I find a thing I am not intrinsically alienated from it, because part  of me is in finding it. In finding a pebble I select it from amongst others   and I make that pebble part of myself. 446 lAndscApe in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="20"> 47  Rather than attempting to produce a theory of things in gen- eral as if the thing indeed were a self- evident category in itself and  for itself (the so- called realist ontological position), we need to escape   such a framework entirely. The failure is well exemplified by Hodder’s   abstractionism and the sheer generality of Olsen’s conclusions, in  which he reaffirms that things are concrete and real (they do really  exist outside thought) and can be soft or hard, small or big, display  temporality or resist it, etc. Every anthropologist and archaeologist  knows this already. What is required if we are to move forward is a theory of particular  kinds of things understood in their material and social and historical con- texts. Such a theory will inevitably be an anthropological and historical  theory of material culture that already currently exists in a wide variety   of forms (e.g. Appadurai 1986; Gell 1998; Miller 2010; Rowlands 2005;  Tilley et al. 2006).  I have attempted to provide such an anthropological and histori- cal theory in this book, a theory of the humble pebble contextualizing  its meaning and significance within a narrative about a landscape com-  posed of pebbles over the longue durée. I have conducted a deliberate  interweaving of pebbles past and pebbles present in the account and the  manner in which persons in cultures relate to them through the long  term. The account began in the present, returned to the past and con- cludes in the present because past and present are always co-p resent  with each other. It has been a sustained phenomenological consideration of pebbles  in relation to the landscape and the sensual human body. It puts, above  all, a stress on the materiality of sensuous relationships between persons  and things and that the character of these sensual relationships is in part  related to whether the things are found (‘natural things’) or made (cul- tural artefacts) or quasi- things (e.g. landscapes and domesticated ani- mals and plants) that are both found and made. What is crucial to consider here is the manner in which meaning- ful human relationships with things are related to their perceptual phe- nomenal qualities: the touch of things, the smell of things, the taste of  things, the sound of things and their visual perception. A bodily engage- ment with pebbles draws them into a wide-r anging series of bodily and,  more widely, social relationships in which the inert pebble, which cannot  speak or feel for itself, nevertheless has a fundamental role in mediating  human relationships both in the past and in the present. Pebbles in a peb- bled landscape have entrapped people because of the materiality of both  A theory of pebbles in A pebbled lAndscApe 447 </page> <page sequence="21"> 48 thing and landscape that, in tandem, generate, quite literally, what one  can build, or do, or think with such a thing in such a landscape in such   a time.
