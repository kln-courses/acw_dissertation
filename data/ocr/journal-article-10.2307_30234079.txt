The shrine flour- ished in close association with the nearby Enryakuji temple on Mount Hiei during the medieval period. The rows of Siddham characters and the figures of twenty-one Buddhist deities with corresponding kami, neatly arranged in three registers at the top of the composition, clearly explain the honji suijaku (origin and trace) relationships of the Buddhist deities (honji) and the kami Sanno (suijaku). The appellation Sann6 was a collective term commonly used for the twenty-one kami enshrined at Hie, and the deities were interpreted as the manifestations of buddhas and bodhisattvas in Japan. However, the main subject matter of this mandara is not images of Buddhist deities, but the mon- umental image of the sacred mountain, which occupies the major portion of the picture space. This essay will focus on the iconography of sacred land- scape, and considers how the concept of Buddhist Pure Lands was appropri- ated in the topographical painting of the shrine landscapes, especially in this example from the genre of medieval miya mandara.

The painting style of the surviving examples and tex- tual sources suggest that miya mandara were made from the late twelfth century onward, and reached their peak of production in the first half of the fourteenth century. The identity of the location in miya mandara is usually easily recogniz- able, as they customarily include architectural and topographical elements that are specifically associated with the particular shrine. But beyond the superfi- cial portrayal of landscape, the study of miya mandara presents the challenge of deciphering the medieval way of representing invisible ideas in visual terms. The shrine landscape embodied the concept of sacred space, the presence of kami in nature, and the articulation of the honji suijaku l4_:_A theory, all of which have no concrete form. In order to elucidate the medieval visual language and its symbolic significance, this essay will firstly considers the development of miya mandara and the identification of shrine landscape with Buddhist Pure Lands (paradises), before focusing on the iconography of the Nara Sanno miya mandara. One of the earliest textual references to a painting related to a shrine appears in an often quoted passage from Gyokuyo [The jewelled leaves], the diary of Kujo Kanezane (1149-1207). In an entry dated to the seventeenth day of the fifth month in the third year of Juei **"K (1184), Kanezane mentioned that a scroll painting (zue li) depicting the Kasuga Shrine was dedicated by a priest of Nara, and a ritual, including the chanting of the Heart Sutra, took place (Kujo 19o8, vol. 3, 22). Several months later in the same year, Kanezane again men- tioned a scroll painting, this time depicting the sacred image of the Hie Shrine: Monk Sonchfi brought a scroll painting depicting the sacred images of the Hie Shrine. (Kulo 19o8, vol. 3, 54) It is not clear from this description if the images of mishotai 01{~I was honji- butsu (the Buddhist "origin" of the kami of the Hie Shrine) or suijaku (kami in 1. The term mandara is a Japanese derivation of the Sanskrit term mandala, which denotes a visual representation of Buddhist universe.

The dissemination of the idea to the wide strata of society is evident in the popular imay6 ("modern style") song below from the Ry6jin hisho [Dust on the beams: Secret book of songs], compiled by the retired emperor Goshirakawa'in &amp;a Ea i 2. Shrine-related mandara can be divided into three basic categories: honjibutsu mandara, sui- jaku mandara, and miya mandara. The discussion of the first two types is beyond the scope of this present essay. 3. The term "Shinto" mandara was coined by Kageyama Haruki in the 1950s (KAGEYAMA 1976, 22) and commonly used until recently. To avoid the term "Shinto" in the context of medieval kami worship, the word suijakuga is more frequently employed in Japan. Here the term is used to include all three types of shrine-related mandaras.</page><page sequence="4">322 a Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) R in c. 1169.

The application of the theory of honji suijaku to the kami of Hie indicates the decisive influence of Tendai Buddhism with which the shrine was intimately associated since the beginning of the ninth century when Saicho aUi established the Japanese Tendai s'" sect on Mount Hiei M~MYL. The theoretical logic of honji suijaku was analogous to the structure of the Lotus Sutra, which was divided into the realm of shakumon AiP9 (realm of trace) and honmon 4MP (realm of origin) according to the interpretation proposed by the Chinese Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi (538-597) (TAMURA 1992, xv). The develop- ment of Hie Sanno mandara, and in fact all shrine-related mandara, therefore reflected the Tendai philosophy and its active affirmation of the idea of wako d6jin, which, in concrete architectural terms, greatly encouraged the flourishing of the temple-shrine complexes. The demand for images of shrine landscape and sacred deities seem to have increased considerably during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), as Emperor Hanazono (1297-1348) wrote in his diary on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month in the second year of Sh6cht lEIF (1325): This evening in the crown prince's palace, Kiyotsune told us that for the past three or four years, paintings of the Kasuga Shrine has been used to substi- tute for the rituals at the shrine. The painting depicting a view of the shrine is called mandara. Everyone seems to have one these days. (HANAZONO TENNO 1938, 158) The emperor's comment is supported by the large number of Kasuga man- dara that survives today, and testifies to the importance of the cult of Kasuga which developed in close association with the adjacent K6fukuji temple f,.. #.4 An example of a fourteenth-century Kasuga mandara (FIGURE 2), now in 4.

The upper half of the painting follows the established compositional scheme similar to many other examples of Kasuga miya mandara, and depicts a bird's-eye view of the Kasuga Shrine complex in predominantly green Yamato-e-style ( Jcdl) landscape.5 Beyond the cluster of shrine buildings at the upper- most section of the painting, the sacred Mount Mikasa a1a[I is depicted with the moon just above its left shoulder, and five lunar discs with the seated figures of Bud- dhist honji of the kami of the Kasuga Shrine inside are arranged horizontally in the sky. The vermilion torii , gates in the center of the composition marks the entrance to the shrine complex, which is dotted with numerous small structures and a pagoda on the left of the first torii, all providing a recognizable identification of the loca- tion. The beauty of nature is enhanced by the green malachite pigment, which would have been very bright when new. The lower half of the painting in con- trast displays a more schematic structure of honjibutsu mandara, which depicts Bud- dhist deities arranged in orderly rows on a plain background. The hierarchical orga- nization with the most important deity in the center (in this case, S~kyamuni, the honji of the First Shrine) conforms to the geometric structural principles of esoteric FIGURE 2: Kasuga Mandara, Kamakura period, fourteenth century, hanging scroll, ink, color and gold on silk, 99.8 x 35 cm.

Pure Land on This Earth The term "Pure Land" (jOdo) is most commonly associated with the Western Paradise of Amida Buddha and its soteriological doctrine. The familiar visual representation of the Western Paradise in the Taima mandara 2" . .R depicts the blissful land where the golden Buddha resides, surrounded by jewel- clad bodhisattvas and heavenly dancers and musicians.6 The ethereal beauty of the Western Paradise filled with golden towers, jewelled trees, and lotus flowers, offered a positive encouragement of faith and hope for the afterlife to the medi- eval Japanese whose perception of the world was shaped by the bleak prospect of the decline of Buddhism in the age of mappo A? . The Pure Land was perceived as a transcendental space where one could reach only after death in the Amid- ist belief. However, the term jodo encompassed larger spatial and transhistori- cal dimensions, including the concept of Pure Land on this earth. The rationale behind the identification of certain geographical area of Japan with Buddhist paradises was intimately connected to the honji suijaku theory. As Allan Grapard explains, "if a shrine and the area in which it was located were conceived of as the residence of the kami, and if those kami were thought to be hypostases of buddhas and bodhisattvas enshrined in the adjacent temples, then those areas came to be seen as the abodes of those buddhas and bodhisattvas, as Pure Land in this World (gense jodo)"(GRAPARD 1992, 209). The concluding chapter of the Kasuga Gongen kenki t H H taA2, [Miraculous record of the kami of Kasuga] from 1309 confirms thus: Our realm is a land of kami [shinkoku afI N], and over three thousand imperial tombs and shrines, each in their individual ways, are efficacious and miracu- lous as never seen before. It is true that the noble pine tree appears after a frost, and loyal minister appears at the time of danger. In the Age of the Latter Days [mappo], the kami will guide the people with no faith.... Since purity of mind corresponds to the Pure Land, our own kami are the Buddhas. Shrines are none other than the Pure Land. Shining Beryl [Joruri 4i V14A] and Vulture Peak7 can be found within the fence of the shrine. (KOMATSU 1991, 78) 6. The depiction of the Western Paradise in Taima mandara followed the Chinese precedent that incorporated the scenes from the Kanmury6ju ky6 AIte~IR (The Sutra of Meditation on the Bud- dha of Infinite Life) on the borders. The image was called bien xian (Jp. hens6zu "#VH M) in China and Korea, and the term mandara was used only in Japan. 7.

Tosotsuten 9Y 7), the Future Buddha Miroku's Pure Land. Mount Mikasa was identified with the Pure Land of bodhisattva Kan- non, Potalaka (Jp. Fudaraku Wii ) (TEN GROTENHUIS 1999, 159) The identification of shrine landscape with a specific Buddhist Pure Land encouraged the practice of pilgrim- age to shrines, as well as the devel- opment of a confraternity, Kasuga ko 4 , with membership extending to provinces. Elizabeth TEN GRO- TENHUIS (1999, 156) suggests that some Kasuga mandara were proba- bly commissioned by these ko devo- tees to use as an icon in the rituals. The projection of Buddhist par- adise onto the actual geography offered pilgrims the opportunity to physically experience the "Pure Land" which was often located in the midst of awe-inspiring natural beauty. In particular, the pilgrimage to Kumano, the earthly paradise of Kannon, is a well documented phe- nomenon, supported by records of frequent imperial pilgrimages from the late Heian period.8 FIGURE 3: Kumano Mandara, Kamakura period, fourteenth century, hanging scroll, ink, and color on silk, 134 x 62 cm. Courtesy of The Cleveland Museum of Art. However, as already noted the proliferation of shrine-related mandara only gathered pace in the second half of the Kamakura period. Visual records such as the fourteenth-century Kumano mandara in the Cleveland Museum of Art (FIG- URE 3) and a section from Ippen hijiri-e (dated 1299) convey to us the popularity of pilgrimage that fulfilled the pious desire in the context of both Buddhist and the worship of kami. The concluding chapter from the aforementioned Kasuga Gongen kenki clearly suggests that the motivation of pilgrims was to physically 8.

Yet attention should be drawn to the first part of the passage, where the status of Japan as the land of kami (shinkoku) is stressed. Moreover, it states that in the age of mapp&amp;, the kami is the entity who leads people of lesser ability to the Buddha realm. The term shinkoku is often associated with Kitabatake Chikafusa IL 2V (1293-1354) whose influential text Jinno shotoki *t$EEfRIE commenced with the famous sentence "Great Japan is shinkoku." The word was translated as "the divine country" or "the divine realm" in the past, creating an impression that the second Chinese character "koku" was similar to the modern notion of Japan as a nation.9 However, Kuroda Toshio has argued that the medieval concept of shinkoku was strongly associated with the geographical area, the physical "land" itself rather than the abstract idea of Japan as a country (KURODA 1995, 44). Although Kuroda himself acknowledged that there was a conscious effort to create the ideology of "Nihon koku" by the Kamakura bakufu especially after the attempted Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, it seems more appropriate to interpret the term as "the physical land" where the kami resided (KURODA 1965, 123). The term itself was already used in the eighth-century Nihongi,1' but it was during the Kamakura period that the concept of Japan as "the land of kami" became an important issue in the writings of Buddhist thinkers. The Tendai monk Koshfi YL (1276-1350) attempted to define Japan as shinkoku, "the land of kami" by explaining thus: "India is the birth place of the Buddha, China is the land of all buddhas, Japan is the land of kami, and for that reason the deities will lead the land to prosperity" (K6SHU, 511). The complexity of the concept of shinkoku and its relationship with the reli- gious and political climates of the Kamakura period is beyond the scope of this paper, but in the case of texts concerning the Hie Shrine, a reference to shinkoku already appears in one of the earliest surviving texts on the Hie Sann6 cult dat- ing from 1223, the Yotenki WiV 2 [The record of bright heaven]. Under the heading "Matters on the Sann6" it states: Japan is a shinkoku since the time of seven generations of Heavenly kami and five generations of Earthly kami, and since the time of Tensho Daijin's 7EJk *3 manifestation at Ise-kami of the four directions have protected palaces and homes of people. (STJ: 73) The passage directly and simply describes that Japan is the land where kami resided and protected people, rather than to reinforce the ideology of Japan as 9. For example, W. G. ASTON (1993, 230.), Paul VALEY (1980, 49), and Royall TYLER (1990, 290) all use the word "divine." lo. According to the Nihongi, during the Empress Jingfi's expedition to Silla, she was assisted by the Wind God and the Sea God who created a tidal wave for the empress's ship to reach the interior of the country. The terrified King of Silla uttered "I have heard that in the east there is a shinkoku called Nippon" (ASTON 1993, 230).</page><page sequence="9">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 327 a divine country. The opening passage of another Hie Sann6 text, Hie Sann6 rishoki H Ul~J~-2 [The record of efficacy of Hie Sanno]]" also starts with a similar declaration: Our Akitsushima [Japan] has been constantly respected as shinkoku, and since the reign of Emperor Jinmu, generations of human sovereigns have been protected by one hundred kings. The first shrine was established during the reign of Emperor Suijin. Since the time of Tensho Daijin's descent from the heaven during the reign of Emperor Suinin, there have been a multitude of kami, among them the spiritual power of Hie Sanno brightens the heaven and his efficacy and energy reaches to tens of thousands of people. (STJ: 649) The acknowledgement of Japan as "the land of kami" in these texts indicates that the discourse on shinkoku was increasingly affirming the prominent role of kami in Japan where Buddhism could flourish even in the age of mappo under their protection. The development towards the reversal of kami-buddha rela- tionship from the essentially Buddhist-centered view to the han honji suijaku a4i&amp;*fA ` theory emphasizing the unique circumstance of Japan was taking place at the time when the demand for shrine-related mandara increased. In comparison to the large number of Kasuga mandara that exists today, relatively few examples of miya mandara related to the Hie Sann6 cult have sur- vived the ravages of time. The most prevalent type of Hie Sanno mandara pro- duced during the Kamakura period seems to have been the suijaku mandara, which depicted the kami of the shrine as Japanese monks and courtly figures, but even those are not more than ten in number. Fewer examples survive in the case of the honjibutsu and miya mandara.12 The rarity of miya mandara is partly due to the fact that the Hie Shrine is within easy reach of the capital Heian-kyo, and probably there was no demand for images to serve as substitutes for vis- its to the shrine. The distance of Kasuga and Kumano from the capital was the main reason for the miya mandara as already noted in the comment of Emperor Hanazono. It is also important to remember that the Hie Shrine suffered a cata- strophic damage from the burning of Mount Hiei by Oda Nobunaga ia,Ef-k % (1534-1582) in 1571, as well as the effect of the haibutsu kishaku ~A1MR (anti- Buddhist iconoclasm) movement in the Meiji period (1868-1911). The destruc- tion of Buddhist artifacts was particularly serious at Hie in the late nineteenth century, as one of the shrine priest Juge Shigekuni ta-T~#lR (1822-1884) was an ardent supporter of the shinbutsu bunri 341L., (separation of kami and 11. The date of Hie Sanno rishOki is not certain, but thought to originate from the Kamakura period. Several copies of the text, some under the title Sanno reigenki survive in the form of emaki with illustrations. The main body of the text contains the stories of the kami Sann6 in relation to individual monks of Mount Hiei (STJ: 649-95). 12. The earliest extant Hie Sann6 mandara is the honjibutsu type, which depicts nine Buddhist deities, dates from the thirteenth century and is now kept at Enryakuji.</page><page sequence="10">328 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) Buddha) policy, and was responsible for instigating a large-scale destruction of Buddhist materials in 1870.'13 Consequently, it is extremely difficult to study the development of Hie Sanno mandara systematically from the small number of examples, yet the high artistic quality of the surviving examples still amply sug- gests the significant role these mandara played in the ritual practices concern- ing the Hie Sann6 belief. The Iconography of Sacred Landscape The Nara Sann6 miya mandara is a large silk hanging scroll that depicts a pan- oramic view of the entire shrine complex of Hie, which is situated at the foot of Mount Hiei located to the northeast of Kyoto. The Hie Shrine flourished in close association with the Enryakuji @, and by the time this image was made, the shrine was a large institution consisting of twenty-one main shrines, subdivided into three groups of seven named the Upper Seven, Middle Seven, and Lower Seven Shrines, as well as an array of subsidiary small shrines. Each of the seven principal kami was paired with the Buddhist honji in one of the Upper Seven Shrines as is indicated in TABLE 1. TABLE 1: The Seven Upper Shrines _itLi of Hie.

It is reported that the bonfire of Buddhist materials belonging to the Hie Shrine burnt for three days during the riot of October 1870 (UCHIKAWA 1983, 338). 14. The spirit of kami was distinguished by two opposing qualities, namely nigi mitama 03[lf (pacified spirit) and ara mitama fUOA (rough spirit) which could be enshrined separately as in the case of Hie. The two shrines in the eastern enclosure, Ni no miya and Jfizenji, enshrined the nigi mitama of Oyamakui no kami and Kamotamayori hime no kami respectively, while their arami- tama were enshrined atop Mount Hachi6ji in the Hach6ji and San no miya shrines.</page><page sequence="11">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 329 The total number of shrines amounted to 108 inner shrines within the Shrine complex and 108 outer shrines in vicinity, which enshrined multitude of local kami and "guest" kami solicited from other locations.'5 The numerous buildings nestling at the foot of the sacred mountain depicted in the Nara Sanno miya mandara testify the prosperous state of the shrine at the time. This mandara is often reproduced to illustrate the nature of shinbutsu shugo M4'LM,a at this location, but the study of the image itself has not been extended beyond cata- logue description in the past. In order to more fully elucidate the iconography of sacred landscape, the following sections will firstly consider the date of pro- duction, analyze the composition and painting style, and then discuss the pos- sible function of miya mandara. DATE Scholars' opinions on the date of this mandara have been divided in the past, ranging from the late Kamakura to Muromachi periods.16 Shrine-related man- dara are not inscribed with dates in general, and the dating of works is based on the stylistic comparison with the few examples of dated painting such as the Ippen hijirie - -E (1299), the Kasuga mandara from the Yugi Art Institute ik 7ITK4Mi (1300) and the Kasuga Gongen kenki @ B FAil-2 (1309). The discrep- ancy among dates for the Nara Sanno miya mandara highlights the difficulty of dating paintings on purely stylistic grounds. Although this mandara is inscribed in ink with some dates on the back, interpreting inscriptions on medieval paint- ings can present problems as they were often added much later, most likely at the time of repair. The inscription is dated from the year corresponding to 1626 (the third year of Kan'ei), stating that the dedication ceremony was conducted by the seventy-five years old monk Ch6yu of the Nichirin'in temple. It also states that the painting was done in the dates 1447 (the fourth year of Bun'an) and was repaired and lined in 1574 (the second year of Tensho). fIaTE71J- H aL E1 N a01aM It has been noted that the calendrical cycle's Chinese character combination for the first date 1447 is incorrect and the word "Saito" TtA (Western Pagoda) 15. The number 108 is indicative of the strong Buddhist influence on the development of the Hie Sann6 cult, as it corresponds to the number of impediments to be overcome to attain enlighten- ment. 16. KAGEYAMA (1976, 96) has dated the work to the late Kamakura period, while the Cleveland Museum exhibition catalogue dates it to the fifteenth century (CUNNINGHAM 1998, 164).</page><page sequence="12">330 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) FIGURE 4: Hie Sannosha kozu, Muromachi period, hanging scroll, ink and color on paper, 52.9 x 71.8 cm. Enryakuji. may be a mistake for "T6to" * (Eastern Pagoda).'7 (BIWAKO BUNKAKAN 1991, 33). As it was quite common for medieval paintings to be attributed to a certain painter or to a certain date during the Edo period, long after its actual creation, it is hazardous to accept the dates mentioned in the inscription as a reliable record. Therefore the dating of the mandara needs to be addressed from several angles. Firstly the examination of the painting style, especially that of mist which is painted in horizontal bands, indicates a date earlier than the fifteenth cen- tury. Examples of Muromachi period painting such as the Fuji mandara or the picture scroll Sanno reigenki LIE 3 RE display a distinctive style of blue mist that is contained in rounded edged cloud shapes, clearly outlined in white. In comparison to such a stylized depiction of mist, the edge of mist in the Nara Sanno miya mandara disappears behind the mountain, or merges softly into the landscape without making an unnatural edge. Similar depiction of mist can be observed in the fourteenth-century Kumano mandara in the Cleveland Museum of Art, mentioned earlier, indicating a similar date for the Nara Sann6 miya mandara. Secondly, the treatment of space in this mandara attempts to incorporate a perspective which creates an impression of smooth progression from the detailed shrine landscape in the foreground to the more stylized mountain 17."T6to" refers to the eastern area of Mount Hiei where the Konpon Chfiud (the Principal Hall) is situated, and "Sait6" refers to the western area where the Shakad6 (Sakyamuni Hall) is situated.</page><page sequence="13">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 331 range in the distance. The overlapping hillocks are skilfully arranged to give a volume to the central mountain, and the irregular grouping of trees interspersed by mist creates an effect of the lower slope of the mountain projecting forward. Such a formula to convey the depth of space is in contrast to the more schematic depiction of mountains seen in the early-fourteenth-century Kasuga mandara or in the Kasuga Gongen kenki. The semi-circular mountains in these images are filled with colorful stylized trees which make a fish-scale like pattern, and give an impression of relief rather than three-dimensionality. The complex place- ment of hills and trees in the Nara Sanno miya mandara indicates the develop- ment of a more sophisticated spatial awareness than the decorative convention of the beginning of the fourteenth century. Finally, a close inspection of buildings in the shrine complex reveals one structure missing in this mandara. Paintings of the Hie Shrine from the Muro- machi period, such as Hie Sannosha kozu *l[ ia--[ [A1" (FIGURE 4) in the collection of Enryakuji or Sanno Himitsu mandara ILLIVEA Rf in the Hie Shrine, all include a seven-storey pagoda on the left of the Omiya Shrine to the extreme left of the painting. If the pagoda existed at the time Nara Sanno miya mandara was painted, it is odd to omit such a conspicuous landmark. The possi- bility of the painting having been trimmed at the time of repair is not feasible as the border of this mandara is not a textile mount, but painted on the same piece of silk. The date of the construction of the seven storey pagoda is uncertain, but an illustrated scroll Hie Sann6 sansha shidai HB '[=IlVaZk [The proce- dure of visit to the Hie Shrine] dated 1576 includes a drawing of the pagoda with an inscription stating "Pagoda commissioned by Emperor Godaigo" #ai FM)ja (MIYAJI 1942, 75). The close association of Emperor Godaigo (1288-1339) with Enryakuji suggests that he may indeed have paid respect to the Hie Sanno belief by commissioning the pagoda.19 The pagoda may not have been con- structed, or finished during the emperor's life time, but if not, possibly not a long after his death. The record dated 1330 on a visit by Emperor Godaigo to the Hie Shrine mentions that the earlier pagoda was destroyed by fire in 1309, and indeed the emperor might have vowed to replace the lost pagoda (SAGAI 1992, 116) For the above reasons, the Nara Sanno miya mandara was probably painted in the second quarter of the fourteenth century, after 1309 when the pagoda was destroyed, but before its reconstruction. This coincides with the time when Emperor Hanazono observed that the production of shrine related images was at its height of popularity. 18. Hie Sannosha kozu is thought to have been made to record the view of the shrine before the fire of 1571. An inscription in ink dated 1582 states that this image was shown to the emperor since the social unrest has prevented him from visiting the shrine in person (BIWAKO BUNKAKAN 1991, 154). A similar image Sanno Himitsu mandara is preserved in the Hie Shrine. 19. Emperor Godaigo's sons, Morinaga (1308-1335) and Muneyoshi (1311-1385) both held the position of the Tendai Abbot and provided the emperor with support (ADOLPHSON 2000, 308-309).</page><page sequence="14">332 1 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) MOUNTAIN AS AN ICON The painting is dominated by the triangular mass of the shintai san *4fl01 (sacred mountain), Mount Hachioji jAIT in the Hie Shrine complex, which occupies the major part of the central space. The shrine architecture and numerous other structures in the complex are depicted accurately in realis- tic geographical relationships at the foot of the mountain. The entrance to the shrine complex is marked by a vermilion torii gate at the lower right corner, and viewers are invited to admire the sacred mountain from the south side of Omiya River, which demarcated the shrine complex from the profane outside world. Above the landscape, there are three registers of neatly arranged fig- ures, meticulously painted in bright colors on a dark blue background. In each row, twenty-one kami of the Hie Shrine are depicted in three different forms: as Sanskrit seed syllables (shuji) in lunar disks in the top row, as seated Bud- dhist figures (honjibutsu) in the middle row, and as corresponding figures of Japanese kami in the bottom row. The white rectangular cartouche above each figure identifies the name of each deity, and the honji suijaku pairing between the twenty-one Buddhist deities and kami is clearly revealed. The distinct division between the landscape and the figures of deities at the top of the composition indicates the artist's intention to treat the location as a realistic landscape. There is no human figure in the shrine complex, and the landscape is enveloped in lush green trees and a tranquil air. The main subject matter of the painting is clearly Mount Hachi6ji in the center, with two small shrines, Hachi6ji and San no miya _' perched near the summit. In compari- son to the gentle slope of the real mountain (FIGURE 5), the height of the painted mountain is exaggerated in order to emphasize the role of the mountain as the main icon. The prominent depiction of the mountain indicates that the focus of veneration was the location itself, and not the anthropomorphic figures of Bud- dha or kami. As the veneration of mountains was a widespread practice from FIGURE 5: Mount Hachioji, Hie Shrine.

The word shintaisan, literally "the mountain as the kami's body"' appropriately expresses the religious interpretation of geogra- phy in which the physical presence of mountain provided a focal point. In the case of Hie, archaeological evidence suggests that primitive rituals were per- formed at the large iwakura A (sacred rock) near the summit of Mount Hachi6ji long before the introduction of Buddhism to Japan (MURAYAMA 1994, 5). The sacred rock was revered as the kogane no iwakura -,O@,.ax (golden sacred rock), since the large flat surface of the rock facing the direction of south-east reflected the rising sun, and created an impression of the rock emitting a golden light. It is easy to imagine the feeling of awe the golden rock generated in the mind of ancient people. The existence of numerous kofun -ti (burial mounds) on the slope of the mountain also indicates that this location was a focus of local religious activities in connection to ancestor worship.20 The significance of the shrine, however, took an important turn when the kami of Hie were solicited by Saich6 as the tutelary deities of Enryakuji. The association with the temple was a major driving force for the development of the Hie Sann6 cult, which cultivated the systematic pairing of the kami of Hie with Buddhist honji. Saicho is also credited with adopting the appellation Sanno 11i (Mountain King), originating in China, as the collective name of the kami of the Hie Shrine. According to the Sanke yoryakki WU * &amp;NE [A history of the mountain home], the late-thirteenth-century magnum opus on the Sanno cult, the protective deity of Mount Tiantai manifested as a boy (_-) when the ship on which Saich6 was returning from China encountered a storm. The deity assisted a safe journey of the ship in order to ensure the transmission of Buddhist Law to the east. The passage explains that the name of the deity LI E consists from a first character with three vertical strokes joined by a horizontal line, and a second character with three horizontal strokes joined by a vertical line (STR: 7).21 Furthermore in the text Hiesha Shinto himitsiki HB '[F:i P7 [The secret history of Hie shrine], Sanno was considered as the protector of the three sacred mountains of Buddhism, the Vulture Peak, Mount Tiantai, and Mount Hiei (STJ: 331). The Chinese origin of Sanno is also explained by Allan Grapard who points out that the main temple of Mount Tiantai was dedicated to the triad of Shaka, Yakushi, and Amida (GRAPARD 1987, 215). By the early thirteenth century when the Y6tenki (dated 1223) was written, Onamuchi no kami k E of the principal shrine Omiya was firmly identified 20. Sagai mentions that approximately seventy kofun have been found in the Hie Shrine com- plex by the Otsu city archaeological research project in 1979 (SAGAI 1992, 261). 21. This section of the Sanke y6ryakki draws information from the Sanpo hok6ki W E attributed to Ennin P1z-, the authenticity of which is questionable (STR: 16). As no record from Saich6's time exists, it is not possible to confirm the attribution of Sanno to Saich6, but traditionally he is associated with the naming.</page><page sequence="16">334 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2oo6) with Sakyamuni Buddha, while the Ni no miya was identified with Bhaipajyaguru (Yakushi), and the Sh6shinshi with Amitabha (Amida) (STJ: 73-88). These three buddhas were closely associated with the three main areas of Mount Hiei: Shaka with the Sait6 (the Western Pagoda), Yakushi with the T6to (the Eastern Pagoda), and Amida with the Yokawa Jl)11 area.22 The appellation "Sann6 sansei" (the "Three Sacred Bodies of Sanno") appears frequently in texts such as the Sanke y6ryakki, indicating a particular significance designated to the trio. The associa- tion with the buddhas consolidated the Buddhist influence that identified the shrine complex with the Buddhist paradises, and the sacred Mount Hachioji was interpreted as the Vulture Peak. An imayo song from the aforementioned Ryojin hisho explicitly conveys that the identification was a widespread belief: a VNI I The kami of Omiya , R 0) V L is our lord Sakyamuni -9 L~rf A Once you visit this land M L A II a bond is tied IM1 LaL W ) E - h/ with the Vulture Peak (RT: 73) I suggest that the identification of Mount Hachi6ji with the Vulture Peak was no doubt responsible for the exaggerated height of the mountain in the man- dara. The artist's intention was not simply to depict the physical shape of the mountain, but to superimpose the transcendental idea of the Vulture Peak onto the topography. The image of Mount Hachi6ji in the Nara Sanno miya mandara embodied the ideal of a sacred mountain both in the Buddha world and on this earth. BIRD S-EYE VIEW The use of the bird's-eye view is a common characteristic of miya mandara, which can be observed in abundant examples from Kasuga, Kumano, and Iwashimizu Hachiman. The high viewpoint offered artists the possibility to incorporate the geographical features and architectural details that are not easily visible from the ground level. This characteristic was particularly noticeable in the case of shrine enclosures, which are depicted as parallelograms, and give views of both the interior and exterior of the enclosure. In the case of Nara Sanno miya man- dara, the Omiya (the Principal Shrine) can be seen in the parallelogram to the left, and Ni no miya (Second Shrine) in the enclosure to the right of the picture. Attention should be drawn to several structures scattered in between the two main enclosures. The most conspicuous among them are Buddhist structures, the tahoto #,, (pagoda of [the Buddha] Many Jewels), bell tower, and kondo 22. Allan GRAPARD (1987, 222) has discussed the relationships between a sacred geography of Mount Hiei and the Tendai interpretation of Buddhist time, as well as the projection of mandara onto the physical geography.</page><page sequence="17">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 335 ,k (Golden Hall), some of them clearly labelled in the cartouche. As these structures were destroyed in the fire of 1571, and never rebuilt afterwards, this image serves as a valuable reminder of the physical organization of the temple- shrine complex in the medieval period. The high viewpoint also allowed the distance and orientation of buildings to be shown fairly accurately, providing an easy-to-read ground plan of the site. These characteristics are sometimes described as "map-like", but a comparison between miya mandara and echizu (picture map) reveals a fundamental differ- ence in viewpoint. The map of Kozanji A , dated 1230, is a representative example of a medieval map made for a practical purpose (FIGURE 6). It records the territorial boundaries of the K6zanji temple, as officially verified by the Dajokan )RIE'~ after the land was granted to the priest Myoe HJ1 (1173-1232) by Emperor Gotoba {,~i (1180-1239) in 12o6 (SHIMOSAKA 2003, 428). The boun- dary is shown in red with a few black b6ji U BW (markers) attached to the line, and the four cardinal directions are inscribed in the four corners of the map. The temple halls and a pagoda are shown in the center, each labelled underneath, and they are surrounded by tree-covered mountains. The composition is hori- zontally divided into two halves by the meandering river in the centre, and the lower half is depicted upside down while the mountains to the right and to the left are depicted sideways, giving the impression that the painter stood at the FIGURE 6: Kozanji map, 1230, ink and color on paper, 164.7 x 164.4 cm. Jingoji, Kyoto.</page><page sequence="18">336 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) temple gate and looked all the way around him in each different direction. The principle of echizu is essentially a homocentric view from the ground level, and although there is a certain degree of attempt to depict mountains in naturalistic manner, the practical information takes precedence over artistic merit. In contrast to this human view employed for maps, the bird's-eye view of miya mandara is an imaginary view. In reality, the southeast side of the Hie Shrine complex sloped down towards Lake Biwa, and there was no high ground available for looking down onto the entire shrine complex. No human could have obtained such an aerial view shown in this mandara before the age of flight, yet the viewers accepted it as jikkei (k1, the "real view"), reconstruct- ing the physical experience in their imagination. The bird's-eye view presented the shrine landscape as a mental map in which the earthly abode of kami was viewed from high above the human world. POETIC REFERENCE The development of landscape painting in Japan was intimately connected to poetry from the Heian period. The genres of uta-e a"M (poem pictures) and meisho-e ;FrPk- (pictures of famous places) are in general discussed in the con- text of secular painting, but the distinction between the religious and secular is blurred in miya mandara, which aimed to depict the timeless beauty of nature. The poetic reference to the moon depicted above Mount Mikasa in Kasuga mandara was an integral aspect of a Japanese aesthetic culture in which the accumulation of literary memories enhanced the appreciation of images. The well known poem by the eighth century official Abe no Nakamaro PqlhrP*. (c. 700-770) below established the visual vocabulary that firmly associated the moon with Mount Mikasa: Sa)/ As I gaze out, far A aq1la" across the plain of heaven B H 7e Z ah, at Kasuga =1 LI J t from behind Mount Mikasa l L A ) o it's the same moon that come out then. (Kokinsh t -7A, KT 9: 4o6; translation by Joshua MosTow 1996, 161) The established poetic iconography of landscape, which may be regarded as purely secular in origin, must not be ignored. Small details of landscape may not seem to have any religious significance, yet references to the canon of anthologies were an integral part of the appreciation of visual images and greatly enhanced the sacred nature of the location. The literary association with location in the Nara Sanno miya mandara is evident in the snow-capped mountains in the far distance, which signified the high peaks of the Hira Jt . mountain range to the north of Mount Hiei. These</page><page sequence="19">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 337 remote mountains were a part of ascetic training ground for the monks of the Enryakuji who sought an even more isolated location than Mount Hiei itself. The name of Hira was also an established utamakura ~Mt ("pillow" word for poems) for the province of Omi in classical poetry, associated with snow that lingered in spring and the bitterly cold wind. The poem below by Saigy6o N (1118-1190) is but one of many poems that allude to the snow of Hira. tA, I This place Ohara I A) A0is so close t 1ifto the peaks of Hira; :1a7 7 FTz " i imagine how heavy 4, I" f -snowfalls can be (Shinchokusen shui W i--W* , KT 1: 267) The artist and the contemporary audience would have been familiar with the visual language that conveyed elements of traditional yamato-e subjects, shiki-e 4I~ A (painting of four seasons) and meisho-e associated with the location. The association of Hira with the cold wind and snow was a recurrent theme that was firmly established in the iconography of the meisho-e tradition. Two more poems below which were made for the Emperor Gotoba's project of slid- ing door paintings in the theme of meisho for the temple Saish6 Shitenn6o'in in 1207 confirm the association with snow.23 c 7a # t 2 The mountain wind of Hira U 6 0) from the cold peak 17 Ift scatters snow fT h'l~ on the waves L a) 5 ) 6A to the shore of Shiga Courtier Masatsune Wf_40 ff, Saish6 shitennd'in waka aJDa :{ AgTi' The mountain wind of Hira U9 6 D) 0A brings snow to aif a" far and near l 6 U fU7: old pine tree L a10Aifli on the shore of Shiga. Minamoto Tomochika N,-,R. , Saishd shitennb'in waka (KT 5: 902) The snow on the peaks of Hira usually lingered well into spring, and the image of snow-capped mountain not only signified the location of Hira, but 23. The detail on the Saish6 ShitennO'in project of meisho-e decoration is recorded by Fujiwara Teika in his diary Meigatsuki (FUJIWARA Teika 1911, 23-28). The paintings on sliding doors were destroyed with the temple only twelve years after the construction, but the collection of poems made for the project by ten selected poets remain as Saish6 shitenn6'in waka (KT 5: 896-905).</page><page sequence="20">338 1 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) acted as a reminder of the celebrated poems from the past. In any case whether the painting was religious or secular, the medieval visual language was impreg- nated with literary associations, and added layers of feelings stemming from a sensibility that recognized the sacredness in the beauty of nature. The sacred- ness symbolized by the snow-capped mountains also suggests a close similarity with paintings of Sakyamuni's sermon at Vulture Peak, which usually included the white peaks, adding yet another layer to the medieval visual vocabulary. The close relationship between the worship of kami and the nature meant that the poems celebrating the beauty of nature were interpreted indeed as an expression of religious feelings towards the sublime. The dedication of waka poems to shrines by the eminent Buddhist monks such as Saigy6 and the Tendai Abbot Jien ~MP (1155-1225) highlights the widespread practice that encouraged the identification of waka with Buddhist dharani MMUiL. Jien in particular was an ardent devotee of Hie Sann6, who dedicated his collection of poems Jichin osho uta-awase VOU f/i'niAi~ [A poetry match with oneself by Priest Jichin (Jien), c. 1198] to the Hie Shrine.24 The majority of poems included in the collec- tion expressed Jien's feelings in relation to the nature and the seasons, and did not refer directly to the kami of Hie, yet the dedication to the shrine indicates that Jien regarded his poetry as a religious act. A passage from the thirteenth century Shasekishh, [A collection of sand and pebbles] by Mujfi (1226-1312) explains the logic behind the identification of poetry with dharani as below: The way of poetry has an effect of calming the disorderly heart and brings about calmness and serenity. A few words can express the richness of mind and deliver the correct conduct. The correct conduct corresponds to dharani. The kami of our country are the manifestation of buddhas and bodhisattvas, and they are one and the same. Susanoo no Mikoto within the eight-layered fence of Izumo initiated the thirty-one-syllable poetry that is no different from Buddha's words. Dharani of India is the language of that land, and the Buddha preached the Law with it. (MujU 1966, 222-23)25 The application of honji suijaku theory had a pervasive implication that poems which seem secular on the surface could contain a deep religious sentiment. THE GOLDEN LAND OF BUDDHA The landscape of Hie in the mandara is filled with a gentle glowing light, but unlike many examples of Kasuga mandara, no moon (or sun) is depicted. 24. The collection Jichin osho uta-awase was structured from seven sets of fifteen pairs of poems, and each set was dedicated to the seven principal shrines of Hie (KT 5: 333-40). Saigyo towards the end of his life dedicated two compilations of his poems, Mimosusogawa uta-awase and Miyagawa uta-awase to the Inner and Outer Shrines of Ise. 25. For further discussion of the poetryldharani identification, see "Waka soku daranikan no tenkai" fa lVnR ri -1'rIEM)R (YAMADA 1989, 101-108).</page><page sequence="21">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 339 Instead of an obvious light source in the natural world, the land of Hie itself seems to emit a golden light. Viewers are reminded of the ancient belief that the sacred rock on Mount Hachioji was venerated as the golden rock. The use of gold pigment in some areas of mist and ground in this image precedes the abun- dant used of stylized golden clouds in Momoyama screens. The harsh scallop- edged clouds commonly used in the Momoyama period (1573-1615) act as a decorative device to frame the composition or to hide spatial ambiguity, and to provide vignettes for separate scenes. In sharp contrast to the Momoyama-style's delineation of clouds, the golden mist and ground in the mandara effortlessly blends into the landscape. Gold is used as one of the colors, and infuses the land- scape with a gentle glow, enhancing the precious nature of the location. Metallic pigments such as gold and mica were abundantly employed also in many exam- ples of Kasuga mandara to embellish the shrine approach. Painting the shrine ground with precious pigment, which creates an ethereal effect, seems to contra- dict the idea of a realistic depiction of the shrine landscape, but the shimmering landscape conveyed to viewers the symbolic significance of the location. The significance of a golden land is evident in Buddhist art, especially in the belief in Amida Buddha. The abode of Amida, the Western Paradise, was described in the Amida-kyo (Sukhavativyuha suftra) as a magnificent land of golden ground, filled with jewelled trees, towers, lotus flowers, and ponds (MORI 1959, 72). Copies of the Taima mandara reproduced in the Kamakura period are richly ornamented with gold pigment and kirigane (cut gold) decora- tion, which symbolized the transcendental status of the Pure Land beside the decorative effect. Just as the body of Buddha was characterized by his golden complexion, the ideal of the Pure Land was the land illuminated with shimmer- ing light. The identification of shrine landscape with Buddhist paradise natu- rally encouraged artists to embellish the painting in the manner of shogon 5E 4, the Buddhist concept of adorning the icon in the best possible way. The generous use of gold pigment seen in the Nara Sanno miya mandara suggests the interpretation of the Hie Shrine complex as the Pure Land on this earth. The extraordinary quality invested in the landscape as the notion of Pure Land on this earth is expressed in the term j6jakkodo V',~ta, literally "the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light", which signified one of the Four Buddha Lands in the Tendai theory proposed by Zhiyi, and defined as a kind of generic Pure Land where all buddhas reside. The use of metallic pigment such as silver and mica as well as gold in land- scapes characterized the shrine-related mandara, and distinguishes them from the secular paintings in the Kamakura period. The shimmering shrine approach in the center of the malachite green landscape seen in the representative exam- ple of Kasuga mandara (dated 1300, now in the Yugi Art Institute) clearly indi- cates that the association of gold with sacredness was a part of an established visual language. The trace of gold, though very much worn, is also visible on</page><page sequence="22">340 1Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) the rocky cliff depicted in the famous painting of the Nachi waterfall N/IM0klM, now in the Nezu Institute of Art, Tokyo. This awesome 130-meter-high waterfall in the Kumano region was venerated as the shintai from the ancient times, just as Mount Hachi6ji at Hie was regarded as the "body of kami." The simple paint- ing of the waterfall may, at first, give an impression of a pure landscape, but the larger than life moon and the cliff embellished in gold indicate that the image was an icon for the Kumano cult. Therefore the gold pigment used for the Nara Sanno miya mandara symbolized the idea of the buddha land filled with an ethe- real light, and conveyed the sacredness of the shrine landscape in visible terms. An example of textual reference to the projection of the Buddhist land onto the physical geography of the Hie Shrine appears in the Sanke yoryakki, which clearly identifies the sacred mountain with the jojakkodo (STR, 348).26 This positive affirmation of the phenomenal world as the Buddha land within the framework of honji suijaku reflected the Tendai philosophy of hongaku shiso 4K ,,,, (the theory of original enlightenment), which encouraged the shift in emphasis on "the role of kami within esoteric Buddhist discourse" (TEEUWEN 2000, 96). By the time the Nara Sanni miya mandara was created in the four- teenth century, Japanese kami had become increasingly elevated as the "embodi- ment of universal enlightenment" in the climate of the han honji suijaku theory. The positive affirmation of this earthly realm and the acknowledgement of the Buddha nature in every sentient being down to the trees and grass is cer- tainly expressed in the words of Sann6 wasan fn, a colloquial verse explicat- ing the teaching of sutras: Flowing water in the spring valley, sweeping wind in the autumn mountain, chant to us "all living things possess Buddha nature."' Flourishing trees and grass are none other than the body of Vairocana; steep cliff and rocks are none other than the True Land of Eternally Tranquil Light. (TAKEISHI 1976, 145) It has been suggested that this wasan was recited in front of the mandara by participants in the Hie Sanno cult ritual (GYOTOKU 1996, 33). The similarity of 26. The identification of the Buddhist Pure Land with shrine landscapes, shato jodo kan ?tbf~ta 0, is further discussed in relation to Kasuga by GYOTOKU (1996, 31-36).</page><page sequence="23">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 341 the wasan's words and the Tendai philosophy of sansen somoku shikkai jobutsu ba)II I t (mountains and rivers, trees and grass, all can attain Buddha- hood) certainly are compatible, and the identification of trees and grass with the body of Vairocana reflects the influence of the hongaku shis6, which placed a strong focus on the universal Buddha Dainichi (Vairocana). By the mid four- teenth century, there were Tendai monk scholars, such as K6shfu, the author of Keiran shuiyoshui a " who identified the kami of Hie, and indeed all kami (shinmei WAU), with Dainichi (TEEUWEN 2000, 96). However, the origin and the date of such wasan are extremely difficult to trace, and moreover the words of the wasan do not specifically make reference to Hie. It is applicable to any location, evincing that the idea of shrine landscape as j6jakkodo was a pervasive development in medieval religiosity. FUNCTION OF MIYA MANDARA As already noted in the Kujo Kanezane's diary, the painting of Kasuga Shrine was used in a ritual, during which the Heart Sutra was chanted. In another early textual reference, almost contemporary to Kanezane's remark, Fujiwara Teika (1162-1241) gives valuable information about the ritual function of the paint- ing of the sacred image of the Hie Shrine. In an entry for the fourth day of the eighth month in the tenth year of Kenkyfu )k (1199), he recorded in his diary Meigetsuki (The record of the bright moon): I left the capital for Hie around the time of the evening bell.... After visiting the various shrines, I joined to attend the service.The ritual space was made in the south-east corner of the prayer hall in front of the Jfizenji Shrine by hang- ing shades and placing screens. The leading monk sat in the south side and the two monks responding sat in the north. A mirror with ten sacred images [mish6tai] welded on and a Buddhist hanging scroll with images of twelve mishotai were displayed. Copies of Jiz6 Darani-ky6 and offerings of flowers were placed on two temporary stands. (FUJIWARA Teika 1911, 107) The description indicates that although the ritual took place at the shrine, the service was conducted by Buddhist monks. Teika's description, "a Buddhist hanging scroll with images of twelve mishotai" indicates that the painting was a honjibutsu mandara that depicted the kami in the form of Buddhist honji. The surviving examples of Hie Sanno honjibutsu mandara include varied number of deities, as seen in the example from the Tokyo National Museum which depicts eleven Buddhist deities, or in the example from the Enryakuji with nine deities. The number twelve mentioned by Teika most likely included the images of honji of the Upper Seven Shrines, two usual guardian deities (Fudo 7f# and Bisha- monten E and three other honji figures.</page><page sequence="24">342 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) The Buddhist nature of rituals conducted at the Hie Shrine can also be observed from a scene in the H6nen shonin eden L}KA _ 4 (c. 1307) which shows the monks of the Enryakuji participating in the ritual. The illustration provides a valuable visual record of rituals held inside the haiden in front of one of the Hie Shrine. Although no painting is depicted in this particular scene, Teika's description suggests that a honjibutsu mandara was used on a similar occasion. While the honjibutsu and suijaku mandara placed the emphasis on the anthropomorphic images of deities, miya mandara was fundamentally dif- ferent in character because of its definite focus on landscape. The distinctive subject matter naturally indicates a different purpose, and it has been suggested in the past that the Nara Sanno miya mandara was "in regular use as an instruc- tional tool, as was the Taima mandara" (CUNNINGHAM 1998, 164). Certainly the easy-to-understand organization of the twenty-one Buddhist deities (honji) and the kami (suijaku) indicates the didactic possibility, yet no textual reference or visual record for the performance of popular etoki t, A (picture explica- tion performance) remains in relation to the Hie Sann6 belief. No example of Sankei mandara t , .a (pilgrimage mandara) intended to educate the lay community, exists either in relation to Hie Sanno, which suggests that the ritu- als involving images such as the Nara Sanno miya mandara took place within the exclusive community on Mount Hiei and were not intended for the general public.27 The strong Buddhist connection of the mandara is evident in the inscrip- tion already mentioned, which states that the dedication ceremony of the paint- ing was conducted by a monk of the Nichirin'in on Mount Hiei. The owner of the mandara can be traced in the early-Edo-period writing of the monk Gokan ISM, Hie Sanno Gongen chishinki H lI;EI-1E~O1':E, which includes a set of iconographical drawings of the twenty-one kami of Hie that match exactly the images of suijaku figures in the mandara.28 Gokan states that the drawings were copied from a mandara in the possession of the monk Genkaku of the Keit6o'in ',rU in the Yokawa area of Mount Hiei, and he also transcribed the inscription on the back of the painting that is identical to the one on the Nara Sann6 miya mandara. This no doubt indicates that Genkaku's mandara and the Nara Sanno miya mandara were one and the same. A strong Buddhist connec- tion is also clear in the design of painted borders which incorporate motifs of esoteric Buddhist ritual instruments, and suggests that the mandara was used by Buddhist monks in rituals involving the worship of Sanno. The worship of the kami Sann6 was fully integrated into the monastic life on 27. In contrast to the lack of records for Hie, various visual evidence survives for the etoki prac- tice by itinerant nuns in relation to the Kumano cult (KAMINISHI 2006, 137-64). 28. The Hie Sanno Gongen Chishinki contains three separate sets of iconographical drawings, indicating that there were some variations to the images of kami, particularly those of the Lower Seven Shrines (STJ: 478-504).</page><page sequence="25">ARICHI: SANNO MIYA MANDARA AND PURE LAND ICONOGRAPHY 343 Mount Hiei, as evinced in the case of Tendai zasu &amp;li (abbot) Jien who dedi- cated his poems to the Hie Shrine. Earlier still, the monk Soo U-0tH (831-919), the founder of the kaihbgy l [~if ascetic practice, was well known for his devo- tion to Sann6. The route of the punishing training of kaihigyi encompassed the three areas of Mount Hiei (T6to, Sait6, Yokawa) as well as the Hie Shrine, and the practitioners paid respect not only to the main Buddhist halls but to numer- ous sacred landmarks associated with the kami such as trees, rocks, springs, and shrines. For the practitioners of the kaihigy&amp;, the physical movement in the geography was analogous to the mental progress towards enlightenment. By the fourteenth century, the kaih6gyi was a well established practice at the insti- tutional level with several groups each based in various areas of Mount Hiei. The development of simplified version of pilgrimage focusing exclusively on the Hie Shrine complex was initiated by the members of the Sann6 ko LULJ, a confraternity of monks and local shrine workers (jinin * A) from around the fourteenth century. The so-called "secret pilgrimage" (himitsu shasan R,'ia seems to have flourished during the following centuries (SAGAI 1979, 27). The distinctive characteristics of the Sann&amp; ki were, as the word confraternity sug- gests, exclusive group activities such as the secret pilgrimage which took place at night. The participants, in white identical attires, would walk in silence, led by a leader through the dark shrine complex, holding torches, experiencing the mysterious spiritual energy. The white attires symbolized death, suggesting that the pilgrimage was a symbolic journey to the Buddha-land in the afterlife.29 The route of the secret pilgrimage and locations of stops are well documented by participants in instructional manuals, such as the Hie gydodki H El aTfiu [A record of training route at Hie] (STJ: 285), and the Hie Sann6 sansha shidai, indi- cating clearly the nature of pilgrimage which combined the worship of kami with Buddhist practices. Other activities of the kd members are recorded in the Edo-period manu- script Hie gosairei no shidai H 'r__ [The procedures of the Sann6 festivals], which provides valuable hints about the function of mandara in con- nection to the ritual practice of the kd. According to this text, the ki was orga- nized from six separate groups, each with own elders (rd A), and "since long ago" they held regular meeting in the first, fifth, and ninth month in their own meeting place where they hung an antique sacred painting of Sann6 Gongen and recited the Heart Sutra (STJ: 223-37). As the activities of the kd members such as the secret pilgrimage were closely connected to the landscape of Hie, an image of the shrine complex such as the Nara Sanno miya mandara would have served as a perfect icon. 29. Visual evidence, such as the depictions of pilgrims in the Kumano mandara and the Fuji mandara, indicate that it was customary for pilgrims to wear white, suggesting that the pilgrimage was interpreted as their journey to the Buddha land after death.</page><page sequence="26">344 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33/2 (2006) Conclusion The identification of shrine landscape with the Buddhist Pure Lands in medieval Japan can be confirmed from abundant textual sources, and the surviving exam- ples of shrine mandara offer visual testimony to the way medieval artists strived to overcome the difficulty of depicting the invisible world of sacredness. Miya mandara are often described as jikkei, a "real" scene, as if the artist's primary concern was the physical likeness, but the luminous landscape of Hie aimed to convey the ideology that identified the abode of kami with Buddhist jfjakkodo. The Buddhist concept of shogon (to embellish the icon with precious materials) was clearly a major motivation behind the depiction of the golden landscapes. These mandara were originally a product of the theory of honji suijaku which reflected the interpretation of kami as the manifestations of the Indian deities in Japan from the Buddhist perspective. I would suggest, however, that the true driving force behind the proliferation of shrine-related mandara around the beginning of the fourteenth century was the development of the theory of han honji suijaku, which prompted the reversal of the kami-buddha hierarchy and promoted instead the active role of kami in the Buddhist view of the phenom- enal world. The notion of Japan as "the land of kami" ensured the flourishing of Buddhism in the age of mappo. The shrine-related mandara were categorized in the past using the term Shinto mandara, which invited confusing assumptions that they were employed in ritu- als at shrines in the context of "Shinto:' In this essay I have drawn upon examples of textual and visual sources to stress the Buddhist context in which the wor- ship of kami took place in the medieval period. The Nara Sann6 miya mandara provides a case study of the visual representation that reflected the complex shift in kami-buddha relationship, and epitomizes the theoretical and cultural condi- tions that formed the concept of sacred landscape in medieval Japan.
