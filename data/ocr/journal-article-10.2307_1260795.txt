<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol. 104, 1993 40 Griffins and Arimaspeans ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY EACH of the authors is a member of both the Folklore Society and the International Society of Cryptozoology, and each presented a paper at the joint meeting of the two societies held at the University of Surrey, Guildford, England, 12-33 July 1990. A shorter version of the first half of this paper was presented by Adrienne Mayor then (and at the Biology-Classics Seminar, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., 10 April 1991, and at the Program in the Ancient World seminar, Princeton University, 25 October 1991). Michael Heaney's paper dealt with aspects of wildman research in the Soviet Union. In discussion at the conference the authors realised that they shared common ground in their research and could each contribute to the elucidation of the topic covered in the present article. The conference, which was extremely successful, therefore fulfilled one of the unique functions of such meetings by bringing together in fruitful co-operation researchers who would not otherwise be aware of the common ground they share; our thanks are due to the conference organisers for bringing this about. We are grateful to all the folklorists, cryptozoologists, classicists, and scientists who have made valuable suggestions, especially geologist Sheldon Judson, palaeontologist Dale Russell, and ancient historian Josiah Ober. WHAT WERE THE GRIFFINS? ADRIENNE MAYOR THE ancient Greeks began to make contact with the nomadic cultures of Central Asia in the seventh century BC. Along with the exotic goods exported from Central Asia came folktales about remote eastern lands and their inhabitants. The first written description of two strange Asian creatures, griffins and Arimaspeans, appeared in Greece during this period. The gryps, or griffin, was already known in Near Eastern art; the body was like that of a four-legged predator, but it had a strong beak. In the Scythian lore recounted in Greek and Roman texts, griffins and Arimaspeans were associated with gold; in later accounts, griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets. Since the mid-seventeenth century, scholars have assumed that the griffin was an imaginary composite like the Sphinx or the Minotaur. In 1646 Sir Thomas Browne declared that the gryps was simply a mystical symbol combining attributes of the eagle and the lion. Another scientific book of the same period announced, 'Sober-minded observers ... no longer look upon this creature as the . . guardian of mountain mines ... of barbaric gold. But in 1652, Andrew Ross attempted to refute Browne, arguing that the gryps may have been an attempt to describe an unusual animal of Scythia or Cathay. Ross maintained that Browne 'misrepresented' the ancient writers. They had never claimed that the gryps was a conjunction of two animals, 'a Lion behind and Eagle in the fore-part'; instead they said only that the four-legged creature had a beak. Ross mentioned some notable examples of actual 'mixt and dubious' beasts, such as bats, flying fish, giraffes, and dog-headed apes. He also pointed out that the presence</page><page sequence="2">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 41 of gold in nests was not a fabulous notion, since real creatures, such as magpies, do collect shiny objects. And the lack of griffin sightings did not necessarily mean they never existed or had all perished. Anticipating modern knowledge about rare species, Ross suggested that the animals might have moved to even more remote and inaccessible habitats to avoid human endroachment.' Ross's voice was drowned out in the 'scientific' effort to discredit old travellers' tales about fantastic creatures. For over three centuries, then, most classicists, art historians, and scientists have accepted Browne's idea that the griffin was purely imaginary and symbolic. Yet there was a notable exception to this consensus. In 1827, Georg Adolph Erman travelled across Siberia. He learned that Ice Age woolly mammoth bones, which were found in great abundance along polar river banks, were identified by the Siberians as the remains of colossal birds killed by their ancestors. Erman was the first writer to suggest that such fossil bones might have inspired the ancient legend of griffins. He pointed out that gold-sand lay just under the peat that contained mammoth fossils, which could account for the association of griffins and gold.2 In 1962, classicist J.D.P. Bolton traced the travels of Aristeas, the early seventh-century Greek who first described the griffins and Arimaspeans of Central Asia. Bolton called Erman's mammoth-bone theory 'attractive' and 'impressive' but discarded it as the basis for the griffin story because the mammoth remains of Siberia were so far from the Altai Mountains of Mongolia, where the griffin tale originated.3 Once again, the idea that the legend might have contained a kernel of zoological truth was set aside. We should like to reconsider Ross's and Erman's notions, in the light of neglected and new evidence from several disciplines. The identity of the griffin remains unresolved because each scholar who studies the legend tends to be unaware of important findings in other fields. An interdisciplinary approach drawing from classical art and literature, folklore, archaeology, geology, and palaeontology supports a zoological origin. Analysis of the first Greek reports and early artistic images suggests that the griffin lore arose from speculations about some unique faunal evidence observed in Central Asia. As the story spread, folklore motifs accumulated and artistic imagination became involved, yet the core elements of the original account remained remarkably consistent for about a thousand years. Griffin-type animals combining the features of birds and mammals appeared in ancient Near Eastern art as early as 3000 BC, and they also show up in Mycenaean art. But we have no way of knowing what kind of folklore, if any, was attached to these creatures. The first written description of a griffin that we know of appeared in Greece during the seventh century BC. Little new information seems to have been added after the third century AD. After that, the tradition crystallised into the fabulous medieval griffin with its Christian symbolism. The griffin was a popular motif in Greek and Roman art between about 700 BC and AD 300, and some of these representations appear to be related to the folk themes preserved in the literature of the same period. This thousand- year timeframe of linked, consistent and thriving written sources and related art can be seen as the "natural lifespan" of the Greco-Roman version of the tale.4 Our word 'griffin' comes from the Greek word gryps, meaning 'hooked,' as of a claw or beak. The first known use of the word gryps occurred in a work written by Aristeas, a Greek from the Black Sea area. Aristeas journeyed deep into Central Asia in about 675 BC-around the time of the earliest Greek contacts with the Scythian nomads living east of the Caucasus.5 Aristeas's work (called the Arimaspea) is now lost, but it was</page><page sequence="3">42 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY famous in antiquity. According to fragments preserved in the works of several extant ancient authors, Aristeas said that he travelled among the Scythians, going as far east as the land of the Issedonians. According to classical scholars, 'Scythians' referred to all the nomadic tribes between the Black Sea and Mongolia. Aristeas visited the easternmost Scythians, the Issedonians, whose territory appears to have been south- west of the Altai Mountains and north of the Tien Shan range (Figure 1). Ptolemy, a geographer of the second century AD, located the Issedonians along the ancient trade routes from China to the West, in Dzungaria (Sinkiang, northwest China). Ancient Chinese sources support this locale for the Issedonians.6 Modern archaeology confirms that Scythian nomads, as described by ancient Greek sources, lived along the northern and western slopes of the Altai and Tien Shan during the time of Aristeas.' The first surviving ancient work to use Aristeas was written by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, in about 460 BC. Classical scholars have shown that Aeschylus drew on the Arimaspea for natural details in the tragedy Prometheus Bound, set in distant Asia. Lines 790-805 describe a remote, dangerous land reached by caravan routes far east of the Caucasus, a land inhabited by nomads who prospect for gold. The route crossed desolate plains, the home of fearsome gorgons who turn living things to stone, hideous creatures who share a single eye and tooth, gold-mining one-eyed horsemen called Arimaspeans, and finally, the gryps or griffin. Aeschylus calls griffins 'silent hounds with sharp beaks' (lines 803-4). Aeschylus was careful to distinguish the gryps, which had a beak but no wings, from the winged eagle, aetos (line 1022). In lines 1015-25, the god Hermes tells Prometheus that cosmic thunder and lightning and torrential rain will pound the mountain cliff where Prometheus is chained. An avalanche will bury him at the bottom of the ravine, where he will be 'held fast by arms of stone' for eons. 'You will travel through vast tracks of time, and at last come back into sunlight', a carcass for eagles to ravage.8 Using Aristeas's work, Aeschylus evoked a primeval wilderness of bizarre creatures and bodies trapped in stone for eons, a place where nomads now seek gold. The historian Herodotus was Aeschylus's contemporary. In about 450 BC, Herodotus travelled through Egypt, Asia Minor, and Scythia 'expressly to seek information'. He asked people for explanations of local folklore, and tried to find supporting evidence. He spoke with Scythian tribes just beyond the Black Sea, and quoted Aristeas about the lands farther east: 'Aristeas says in his work that he went as far as the [land of the] Issedonians. North of them lived the Arimaspeans born with one eye. Beyond were the gold-guarding griffins.' Of the rich gold deposits of Asia, Herodotus says, 'I cannot say for sure how the gold is obtained: some say that one-eyed men called Arimaspeans steal it from griffins'.9 The next item of griffin lore comes from a fragment of Ctesias, a Greek physician who lived in Persepolis around 400 BC. Ctesias said that Asian gold was hard to get because it was 'in high mountains inhabited by griffins, a race of four-footed birds as large as wolves and with legs and claws like lions'."1 Pliny the Elder's Natural History of AD 77 marks the next important point in the tradition. Besides noting the griffin's 'terrible hooked beak' he was the first to mention its wings and long ears, two features prominent in griffin art. Pliny wrote: 'Arimaspeans ... are always fighting for gold with the griffins, winged animals whose appearance is well known. The griffins toss up gold when they make their burrows.' This is the first mention of griffin nests."11</page><page sequence="4">82 86 90 94 A3, AMI? A A, AAA */ ZMEINOGOARSK ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ISSEDONIAN TERRITORY PA 48ZYYh ....

According to his biography, written about AD 200, Apollonius reported that the rocks in the region of the griffins were 'flecked with drops of gold like sparks'. He mentioned griffins' strong beaks and said they were the size of lions. As for wings, he claimed that they were not true bird-wings, but only webbed membranes that helped griffins make short hops when they fought.12 In about AD 170, Pausanias travelled throughout the Greek world. He also quoted Aristeas as saying that 'griffins fight for gold with the Arimaspeans beyond the Issedonians ... Griffins are like lions but with the beak and wings of an eagle.' Then Pausanias remarked that the gold emerges near or on the surface of the earth, which recalls Pliny's claim that griffins scrabble up gold when digging their burrows.13 Within a generation after Pausanias, the bare bones of the simple report began to be fleshed out with more vivid details. Here is the version of Aelian, a Roman compiler of natural history in AD 200: 'I hear that the griffin has four legs like a lion, with talons as strong as can be. Its claws are very like a lion's. It is winged and the plumage on the back is reputed to be black, with red chest and white wings.' Aelian then quotes Ctesias, who said that 'the neck has dark-blue feathers, it has the beak of an eagle, and a head just like artists and sculptors portray'. Aelian goes on to say, 'Its eyes are fiery. It makes its nest in the mountains, and although it is impossible to take a full-grown griffin, people sometimes capture the chicks. The Bactrians say that griffins guard the gold of those parts, which they dig up and weave into their nests... However, the Indians sensibly deny that the creatures intentionally guard the gold. The truth is that when the prospectors approach, the griffins take fright for their young, and so give battle -::.:::i'i'::i~ w ~Isiiiiki i:....i:...... .... - :i~i!:i!iiii!i ::,::i;;i~i~~jili~:ii:i ::?::: liiiiii~ ii~ i :;i::iiiii'iiii~l ii i~:ia ,::::i!'ii;!!i!}iiiii:iii :.:...:i..i..:iii: i........ : ::(!: ri;l ::i':;: a'i3 : :::ii::: ...... . . . :. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Aelian tells how the miners journey, in 'armed groups of one or two thousand' to the wilderness of the gold deposits. 'Out of respect for the bravery of these animals, they avoid hunting for gold in the day. They approach in the night when they have the most chance of avoiding discovery. Now, the place where the griffins live and the gold is found is a howling desert. The treasure-seekers, waiting for some moonless night, come with shovels and sacks and dig. If the griffins do not notice them, the men reap a double reward, for their lives are preserved and they bring home their cargo of gold ... rich profit for the dangers they face ... I am informed that the miners return home after two or three years.' A thousand years after Aristeas, Aelian's account retains the basic predator with four legs, claws, and a beak, associated with gold mining. Aelian's version incorporates the later details and adds embellishments. He gives the griffins a more natural motive for aggressive behaviour: they defend nestlings, not the gold. And Aelian quotes a traveller who affirmed that the animal's appearance was as artists show it.14 Scythian art of the 700s BC and earlier is notable for depictions of unknown animals, including griffin-types. Scythian tombs of the mid-400s BC-the time of Aeschylus and Herodotus-were excavated in this century by Soviet archaeologists at Pazyryk, Issyk, and other sites. Hundreds of gold artefacts portraying beaked quadrupeds were found in the tombs. Another remarkable discovery was the mummified body of a Scythian chief, whose skin was tattooed with griffins and other animals (Figure 2).15 At Kelermes, a Scythian site just east of the Black Sea, a mirror-back, made in about 570 BC, was discovered. It shows two naked, shaggy men (often identified as Arimaspeans) battling a griffin.'6 In the 600s BC-around the time of Aristeas and the first Greek contacts with Scythians-the griffin became a popular theme in Greek art. Bronze griffins from Olympia and the island of Samos offer typical examples (Figures 3 and 4). The earliest bronzes show naturalistic, almost reptilian creatures with open beaks, large eyes, forehead knobs, upright 'ears,' and scaly or crested necks. Wings were small and stiff and the gryps was clearly earthbound. Later, the ears and knobs became decorative, the neck was elongated, and the wings were realistically feathered but still flightless.,7 A portrait of a baby griffin can be seen at Olympia, in Greece, in a bronze relief made in about 630 BC (Figure 5). This early item brings to mind Aelian's later claim that griffins protected their young.'8 Two Greek vase paintings of the 300s BC show nomads battling griffins (Figure 6). Bolton points out that 'gold nuggets' are included in the scenes, which appear to be set in a 'rough', 'blasted' terrain.'9 About 100 years after Aelian wrote about Asian gold-miners encountering griffins, the owner of a villa in Sicily commissioned a mosaic. It shows a panorama of lions, tigers, elephants, camels, ostriches, and other exotic but real animals from the far fringes of the Roman Empire, all being captured by various methods. At the very end of the panel is a griffin, lured to a trap baited with a man.20 These are only a few examples of the thousands of griffins in art between 700 BC and AD 300. Combining literature and the art of this period, we can draw a composite of the griffin's appearance, habitat, and behaviour. The gryps was a four-limbed animal the size of a lion, with a tail and strong claws, but it had a powerful beak like a bird of prey. Despite their wings, griffins did not fly. They had large eyes, upright 'ears' or horns, and a forehead knob. The reptilian or bird-like neck had a ruff or crest.

Nomad battling gryps, vase painting, Caria, Turkey, fourth century BC. (A. Mayor after Winter, 1887, cited in Bolton) griffin laid eggs in nests on the ground and fiercely protected its young. Griffin territory was the desolate wilderness near the gold deposits of the Altai and Tien Shan mountains and valleys. Griffins were associated with nomadic horsemen, one-eyed Arimaspeans, and creatures somehow turned to stone. Since Ross and Erman's attempts to account for the legend's zoological features in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, many other explanations of the griffin have been proposed. As noted earlier, art historians and classicists usually consider the griffin an imaginary composite of real animals. Their chief concern is to trace the dissemination of the artistic image from Asia to the Mediterranean.21 Since Browne's treatise in 1646, classicists have interpreted the griffin as symbolizing vigilance, swiftness, the sun, the sky, guardianship, generosity, Apollo, Zeus, royalty, loyalty, death, and the difficulty</page><page sequence="9">48 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY of mining gold. In 1979, art historian Charrire suggested that the bizarre animal forms in Scythian art may have arisen 'from hallucinations induced by hashish'. Bartscht calls the belief in griffins an antidote to 'the intellectual desiccation' of an overly rational society, a 'mirror of our own dual nature'. Others have identified the griffin as garbled description of a real but unfamiliar living animal. For example, Minns maintained that the gryps was really the little steppe jerboa or squirrel, which burrows in gold-sand and is vigilant. And Valentine Ball concluded that the gryps was a 'tolerably accurate description' of a large dog, the ferocious Tibetan mastiff.22 Some have suggested that the griffin represents vague collective memories of flying reptiles or other long-extinct prehistoric species. But this notion requires that humans coexisted with dinosaurs, as Peter Costello points out. He believes that the griffin must have been based on a 'common feature of the nomads' lives'. His candidate is the lammergeier, a bearded vulture with a ten-foot wingspan. Others claim the griffin was really an eagle. But as we have seen, Aeschylus, the first extant author to describe the gryps, distinguished it from a bird of prey. Besides, Scythians, Greeks, and Romans were familiar with raptors: their artists portray realistic eagles and vultures, and Greek and Latin texts describe these birds and their habits accurately.23 It is unlikely that such familiar birds of prey would generate an image of a flightless quadruped. As Ross noted in 1652, it is the combination of the eagle-like beak with four legs that is so remarkable. Costello's insight-that the griffin lore must have been based on a real aspect of nomads' lives-is significant, especially when we compare the griffin to imaginary animals of Greek myth. The griffin is not an obvious hybrid like the half-human, half- animal Centaurs, the Minotaur, and the Sphinx, or Pegasus, the horse with wings. In fact, the griffin does not play a role in any surviving texts of Greek myths. Unlike other ancient monsters, the griffin does not interact with mythical heroes; instead it is encountered by real people of a distant land. Notably, no writer ever claimed to have seen a live griffin.24 Contrary to what might be expected, the fragments of Aristeas's original work selected by other ancient authors do not offer sensational details about the gryps. The dissimilarity between the griffin and other mythical creatures, the consistency of the image over centuries, and the rather mundane details about nests and gold added by later writers, suggest that the griffin may have been based on something observed and verified over time by many people in a specific landscape. Those who study the griffin legend tend to conflate anachronistic, fabulous medieval embellishments with the original seventh-century account of Aristeas, which remained relatively spare even up to Aelian's time. The idea that the griffin was based on observations of fossils has been rejected, as we saw in Bolton's reaction to Erman's mammoth theory. Yet no griffin scholar has considered palaeontological evidence in the region where Aristeas heard about griffins and Arimaspeans from the Issedonians. Furthermore, classical scholars have underestimated the importance and frequency of fossil discoveries in antiquity.25 Moreover, historical examples of folklore based on fossils and artistic reconstructions of prehistoric remains can serve as models for tracing the origin of the griffin legend. Let us briefly review evidence of the ancient interest in fossils and note some examples of folklore associated with prehistoric remains, before turning to modern geological and palaeontological discoveries in Issedonian territory. Numerous Greek and Roman texts refer to fossils, which were exposed in antiquity by earthquake and erosion or deliberately excavated on the mainland, islands, and in</page><page sequence="10">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 49 the Near East. Large or exceptional remains were regarded as either the bones of mythical heroes, monsters, and giants, or as skeletons of extinct animals or men of the remote past. Fossil shells embedded in rock led to theories of evolution and extinction as early as the sixth century BC.26 When Herodotus investigated Arabian folklore about winged serpents, he says, he was was shown 'countless bones and backbones of serpents, many heaps of vertebrae, great and small' in the walls of a narrow mountain pass. He also recounts that a man digging a well at Tegea (in the Peloponnese) came upon a huge skeleton, which was then identified as that of an ancient man. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, the Emperor Augustus built a museum to exhibit 'monstrous bones of extinct sea and land creatures', which some people called 'giants' bones'. Plutarch tells how big bones found on the island of Skyros in about 475 BC were shipped to Athens for display, and he discusses the colossal bones commonly seen on the island of Samos.27 Pliny the Elder gives the exact dimensions of huge skeletons found throughout the Roman Empire; and Pausanias describes the discovery, overseas transport, and public display of many immense bones, said to belong to heroes, giants, sea monsters, elephants, or ancient men. Interestingly, Chinese chronicles of Pausanias's time record the export of fossils and mammoth tusks to Rome. Philostratus listed a dozen cases of great bones exposed by erosion, earthquake, and ploughing in Asia Minor. And Aelian reported that a monster's skull and bones were discovered after a fire on the island of Chios. 'From these, he said, 'people were able to guess how large and how awful the brute was when still alive'.28 Many of the areas where large or unusual bones came to light in antiquity have yielded rich fossil finds in modern times. When the ancients encountered strange remains, they, like palaeontologists today, collected and measured the bones and attempted to visualize the creatures in life. Recent archaeology confirms that fossils and exotic remains were stored with other valuables in temples and shrines. Skulls, bones, shells, horns, skins, eggs, and teeth of exotic or extinct animals were actively collected and traded in antiquity.29 It has long been recognized that folklore about giants and monsters occurs in fossil- rich regions. The association between prehistoric bones and dragons in China is well documented; ancient chronicles refer to excavation of 'dragon bones' in fossiliferous areas of China. A well-known ancient example of fossil-inspired folklore is the Cyclops of Greek myth. Empedocles was the first to relate fossil elephant skulls to the Homeric one-eyed, cave-dwelling ogre. In 1914, Abel pointed out that the large nasal cavity of an elephant skull would lead one unfamiliar with pachyderms to visualize a one-eyed giant. Prehistoric elephant remains are common fossils in Mediterranean coastal caves. Another oft-cited instance of folklore and artistic reconstruction based on a fossil occurred in Klagenfurt, Austria. In 1590, sculptor U. Vogelsang used a huge skull unearthed in a nearby quarry as the model for a 'dragon' in the town square. In the next century a typical folklore giant with a club was erected next to the dragon, which was now said to have ravaged the town. The original skull found by the quarrymen was identified in modern times as that of an Ice Age woolly rhinoceros. The Klagenfurt dragon has been called the 'oldest palaeontological reconstruction'.30 The Cyclops myth and the many examples of other fossil-inspired folklore worldwide suggest that palaeontological speculations may have been more common in antiquity than has been recognized. According to Herodotus, 'It is among the Issedonians themselves that the strange tales' of Arimaspeans and gold-guarding gryps originated.31</page><page sequence="11">50 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY :~'??iZ4 * 1 :?:::,4 Fig 7.

(Andrews, 1926) To identify the gryps animal, we must first locate the rich gold deposits exploited by the Scythians, Issedonians, and reportedly by the Arimaspeans, and then determine whether gold-seekers would have been likely to encounter fossil exposures that might have inspired the image of the gryps. The extreme climate, remote and difficult terrain, long history of border wars, ongoing unrest, and twentieth-century Cold War tensions, not to mention myriad name changes and spelling revisions, have all contributed to the paucity and obscurity of palaeontological and geological information about the Issedonians' old territory, which now lies on the border of the former Soviet Union with China. The Altai and Tien</page><page sequence="12">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 51 Shan ranges contain abundant gold-sand; placer gold erodes from deposits in the massifs into the foothills and basins below. And some of the world's richest fossil beds are located in the badlands and sedimentary cliffs along the old caravan routes across the Gobi, Turfan, and Dzungarian deserts between the high peaks of the Altai and Tien Shan. Ancient gold-seekers may have been the first to encounter the fossil remains, for the auriferous sand of this region has been mined since the Bronze Age.32 Roy Chapman Andrews was the first modern palaeontologist to investigate the fossils of the Gobi badlands east of the Altai in the 1920s, after he heard local Chinese folklore about dragons' teeth and bones. His team travelled along ancient caravan routes to a blasted landscape where they discovered-on the surface or only partially embedded- bones of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs 'strewn over the surface almost as thickly as stones'. Many of the skulls had prominent beaks, knobs, and head frills, which were preserved in articulation with four-limbed skeletons. The windswept region had been a vast nesting ground of the Protoceratops (Figures 7 and 8). Many shallow depressions still held clutches of fossilized eggs, and young dinosaur skeletons were scattered about. This eerie panorama of throngs of strange animals was awe-inspiring to the team. Andrews wrote that the region was 'paved with bones'-in two weeks he gathered over a ton of specimens, and in two summers over one hundred Protoceratops were excavated.33 Excavations continued sporadically in the Altai region. Between 1946 and 1949, for example, Soviet palaeontologists took 120 tons of fossils from sites in southwestern Mongolia. Beginning in 1968, Polish-Mongolian teams found extremely rich dinosaur exposures in the same region. In 1987, a Canadian-Chinese team began work along the Chinese-Mongolian border: their finds include numerous complete protoceratopsid skeletons with nests, eggs, and young, and isolated 'raptor-like claws' about six inches long. Chinese palaeontologists in the Dzungarian basin of northwest China have recently found the remains of psittacosaurs, 'parrot-beaked' dinosaurs.34 In these windswept dunes, alluvial depressions, and red sandstone outcroppings of the Gobi, Dzungarian, and Turfan deserts, fossils are constantly being revealed by windstorms and erosion. Palaeontologist Dale Russell, a co-leader of the Canadian- Chinese project, remarks that the 'extreme aridity and tenuous plant cover' make it possible to see fossils on the surface of Mesozoic strata: the shapes of the skulls and skeletons are obvious, and the surrounding rock is soft, making collection of bones and eggs fairly easy. The fossil-bearing badlands also shelter game, and these formations stand out as prominent landmarks along the caravan routes. Russell's colleague, Philip Currie, notes, 'There is every reason to believe that ancient nomads would have seen dinosaur bones . . . and eggs' because 'the fossils are a different color than the rocks'.35 The most common remains, including eggs and young, are of the Protoceratops (ceratops means 'horned head'). This creature appears to combine the features of a mammal and a bird of prey in a striking way. The body is about seven or eight feet long, and resembles that of a carnivore, but the skull has a powerful beak (Figure 9). The large nostrils and eye sockets and the knobs and frills of protoceratopsids (and the distinctive skulls, beaks, and giant claws of other dinosaur species) may explain the features of the archaic images of the gryps (and might account for some other unidentified animals in Scythian art). To ancient observers, the presence of adults, nests, eggs, and young might have suggested scenes of animals defending hatchlings.36 Griffins were said to 'guard' gold, which Arimaspeans and others were believed to obtain by combat or stealth. The proximity of the fossil exposures in the desert badlands and the gold-prospecting foothills accounts for the association of gold and griffins in</page><page sequence="13">52 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY '_ 71 2!,:: zw, ?U kt ~ i-~ W Rk", Fig 9. Partially excavated Protoceratops skull, Gobi desert. (Andrews, 1926). Issedonian-Scythian folklore. Legends attached to the dinosaur remains observed on the way to gold deposits may have originally inspired the idea of monsters 'guarding' the approaches to, rather than the actual gold nuggets.37 Knowledge about real bird behaviour-collecting shiny objects for nests-could have been extrapolated to the gryps, which had a beak, wings, and a nest. Spectacular quantities of golden artefacts have been excavated from numerous Scythian tombs along the northwest slopes of the Tien Shan and Altai ranges, from Lake Balkhash to Lake Baikal; these mountains and their alluvial basins were the source of Scythian gold. The word Altai means 'gold' and many other place-names along the ancient trade routes in this area attest to the abundance of gold-sand. The exact locations and volume of gold deposits in the former Soviet Union and China have traditionally been closely guarded secrets, but place-names, and the observations of early travellers, archaeologists, and even Western intelligence sources, indicate that auriferous sand occurs along the caravan routes. One common method of obtaining gold in antiquity was to sift through gravel scree that had eroded into shallow depressions; placer gold was also panned in rivers and manmade channels and dug out of mines. Between 1860 and 1950, Russian archaeologists discovered more than a hundred ancient gold mines which had been worked since about 1500 BC. One mine even contained the skeleton of a Bronze Age prospector, whose leather bag still held gold nuggets.38 We now have enough evidence to propose a hypothetical reconstruction of the Issedonian tale featuring gold, griffins, and Arimaspeans. The story might have gone something like this: 'To reach the gold, we make a long, difficult journey through a vast, dangerous wilderness surrounded by high mountains. In the sandy hills and gullies at the foot of the mountains, gold is near the surface-sometimes we find nuggets among the pebbles and gravel. In the red cliffs of the desert, we pass many strange creatures</page><page sequence="14">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 53 who have all perished. Only fearsome skeletons remain, all turned to stone. We find nests on the ground, with eggs and some with babies, also turned to stone. Sometimes we find their huge claws on the ground. These creatures must have been fierce and powerful, like lions, with horrible talons and teeth. But their heads are not like any beast we know. They have strong beaks like eagles' great staring eyes, and strange knobs and horns like long pointed ears. Some have parts like wings or crests. We have never met anyone who has seen one of these monsters alive!' 39 Petrified bones of weird creatures in a remote, perilous land of gold treasure, barbarian images of bizarre animals, travellers' tales, and souvenir stone eggs or claws as big as drinking cups; over time these evolved into the story of the griffin battling the Arimaspeans for gold, culminating in a fantastic tale discounted by scientific scholars of all persuasions. Yet the insights of Ross in 1652, Erman in 1827, Costello in 1979-three scholars who considered the griffin from widely differing perspectives over a span of four centuries--pointed the way to the griffin's origin as fossil-inspired folklore. David Norman, who studies dinosaur evolution, has remarked that dinosaurs are the 'virtual personification of . . . mythical beasts [of] folklore'. Our timeless fascination with fabulous creatures, whether mythical beasts or extinct dinosaurs, is a key to what makes us human, in Norman's view, because they require us to 'exercise both imagination and creativity to bring them back to life'."4 The ancient Issedonians were following that same impulse, attempting to reconstruct the life and the fate of the multitude of strange animals that perished in the desert. 55 Aiken Avenue Princeton, NJ08540, USA WHO WERE THE ARIMASPEANS? MICHAEL HEANEY Looking at the petrified battlefield, the Issedonians naturally cast around for the antagonists of the monstrous griffins. According to the tale which has come down to us, the Issedonians averred that their neighbours the Arimaspeans fought the griffins. If we consider the gold-guarding griffins to be flights of Issedonian fancy, it is natural to see the Arimaspeans as a real tribe about whom the Issedonians told tall tales. Once we realise that it is the griffins which are real (or at least have a solid base in reality), the explanation which the Issedonians gave about the demise of the griffins raises a new question. If the Issedonians were seeking a rational explanation for the presence of the bones of ceratopsian dinosaurs, how and why could they attribute them to battles with their 'neighbours' the Arimaspeans? If the Issedonians had any social intercourse with the Arimaspeans, they could not be under the delusion that the Arimaspeans were the cause of the griffins' deaths. The Arimaspeans may have had their own explanation for the presence of dinosaurs' bones, but they would not have told the Issedonians, 'we fight with them'. It is plain that the chain of thought was not 'there are Arimaspeans, who fight griffins' but 'there are dead griffins; someone must have fought with them; the deaths must be the result of battles with the Arimaspeans'. The Arimaspeans come into the picture as part of the attempt to rationalise the presence of dinosaur bones. The Arimaspeans lived beyond the Issedonians, and beyond the Arimaspeans lived the griffins.4' They are, therefore, a people inhabiting the approaches to the Altai</page><page sequence="15">54 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY Mountains-that is, northern Sinkiang and western Mongolia-who have no contact with the Issedonians although geographically close to them. Issedonians and others involved with the gold deposits probably lived near the oases along the trade route, and travelled through the lands where Arimaspeans dwelt, without ever meeting them, in order to reach the gold. Classical sources are more reticent about the Arimaspeans than they are about the griffins. All the sources are presumed to derive ultimately from Aristeas. Aeschylus (Prometheus Bound, 803 ff.) characterises them as one-eyed horsemen; Herodotus agrees, and adds that they steal the gold and that they drove the Scythians west. The only other writer to add more information is John of Tzetzes, a late Byzantine writer who is generally acknowledged to have had access to earlier Greek sources now lost. He characterises the Arimaspeans as strong warriors, good horsemen rich in flocks of cattle and sheep and goats; they are one-eyed, 'shaggy with hairs, the toughest of men'. The hairiness of the Arimaspeans is confirmed by the unique Kelermes mirror, which appears to show two Arimaspeans in the grypomachy. In the mirror, although the Arimaspeans are hirsute they show no sign of monocularity. They are shown in profile, so only one eye is visible on each; but they face each other, and the eyes are placed correctly for binocularity.42 The Arimaspeans are wild, hairy, and one-eyed; they are horsemen, and possess rich herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. What is remarkable is that these traits are variously attributed to a 'people' said to inhabit the same area today, with a very similar name: almas, almasty, or albasty. The name in its various forms is widespread in the Mongolian, Turkic, and Iranian languages of Central Asia and the Caucasus.43 The tales told about the people vary from extremely naturalistic to wildly improbable. Some scholars give credence to the idea that these are real creatures, being representatives of a primitive hominid species. The most prominent researcher of the topic, the late B.F. Porshnev, assembled a wealth of material and rediscovered the forgotten works of a number of previous researchers, most notably of the Mongolian scholar Tsyben Zhamtsarano. Porshnev's work is the best source for much of our knowledge of tales and legends about these creatures, but he is undeniably controversial, partisan, and thereby given to overstating his case.44 We shall therefore cite a more balanced summary exposition of Mongolian beliefs by the Mongolian scholar Damdinzharyn Maidar: Almases, according to the stories of witnesses, appear half animal, half human, with reddish- black hair. The face is hairless, the stomach covered with sparse growth. The head seems pointed at the occiput, the forehead flattened back with projecting brow ridges, and prominent cheekbones. They are the height of an average person. The almas walks with half-bent knees, is round-shouldered and pigeon-toed. It has broad shoulders and long arms. The women have long breasts. Almases are timid, suspicious, but not aggressive, and lead a nocturnal way of life. No-one has heard their speech. They have been encountered in the majority of cases at dusk and dawn. They feed on roots and plants. Almases seek out uninhabited places, so are found in the mountains far from populated spots and nomads' field camps, but stay close to wild sheep [argali] and wild goats [iangir iama]. When herders, for example, in Tangal somon in Baian Ulegei aimak [in western Mongolia] move their herds from their mountain winter quarters to the distant summer pastures, their places at the warm time of the year are occupied by wild sheep and goats, and following them almases usually appear. Herders say that they meet almases in pairs, or alone, and one once saw a small almas child.</page><page sequence="16">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 55 Tsyben Zhamtsarano, according to Porshnev, researched the distribution of reports of almases and detected a shrinking area of distribution: at the beginning of the nineteenth century reports came from all over southern Mongolia and the Gobi desert regions of Inner Mongolia; by the time of his researches, in the 1920s, reports came only from the Gobi Desert and the Khovd region of western Mongolia, which includes the Altai Mountains.46 Zhamtsarano's pupil Rincen adduces the many place names in southwestern Mongolia involving almases, e.g. Almasyn Ulan Khada, 'Red Cliff of the Almases'; Almasyn Dobo, 'Almas Hills'; Almasyn Ulan Oula, 'Red Mountains of the Almases'.47 A. M. Markova, a researcher at a southern Kazakh agricultural institute, who investigated the folklore attached to horses by the local people, reported that Kazakh herders believed that almases sucked the milk from their mares at night, and plaited the horses' manes.48 If we move further from the area of the almases' supposed habitation, more fantastic elements may be found. Rincen notes this for northern Mongolia;49 but the creature so named has been especially well discussed in relation to the beliefs of the peoples of the Pamirs region, some nine hundred miles southwest of the region we are proposing for the Issedonians, the Arimaspeans, and the Mongolian almases. B. A. Litvinskii describes the albasty as follows: In general ... albastys appear to people in the form of a woman (rarely, a man). It is usually a very fat, ungainly woman, covered in hair, or a gaunt swarthy woman with dishevelled yellow or black hair and drooping breasts, or a dirty old woman in torn clothing with matted hair. The albasty's breasts are so long that she sometimes throws them over her shoulder. Her body is black. The albasty's zoomorphic manifestations are as a lion, a tiger, bear, cat and dog. The dog-albasty is big and ungainly, with matted hair (often yellow) with two spots above the eyes. The Mountain and Pamiri Tajiks suggest at times that the albasty has the form of a wild, foul-smelling man with the muzzle of a wild boar, crooked fangs and a hairy black body. A characteristic feature of the albasty are numerous breasts, with an infant at eaoh of them. The breasts secrete venom, which she tries to give to the infants, but they also contain milk as sweet as honey, which she often feeds to them. The albasty harms not only women in labour and infants, but smothers people, horses and sheep in their sleep.50 Another writer on the mythology of the Pamirs, A. K. Rozenfel'd, characterises the 'almasty or albasty' as 'a werewolf harming women in labour and young children'. She also discusses another anthropomorphic figure of Pamir mythology, the gul'biiaban, but goes on to say: There is a widespread independent cycle of tales about the wild man (adam dzhapaisy), only sometimes intermingling with the tales about the gul'biiaban. The basis of this cycle is the concept of a naked man, without clothing, herbivorous, avoiding people and never coming into contact with them. While the gul'biiaban is said to live in the mountains of the Pamirs, the 'wild people' are firmly said not to live in the Pamirs, but 'they have been seen in western China'. Conceptions about the 'wild people' are very hazy; usually Kirghizes reply to questions about them by saying, 'Just as there are wild horses, camels and other animals, so there are wild people too'.51 Reports of wild people in Central Asia may be found thoughout history. A thirteenth- century Armenian traveller reported that the desert was 'inhabited by naked wild men with horse-hair on their heads. The breasts of the females were extremely large and</page><page sequence="17">56 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY pendant'.52 At the beginning of the fifteenth century Johann Schiltberger visited the Khanate of Siberia, and reported: There is a mountain in that country, which is thirty-two days' journey in extent [a reference either to the Altai or Tien Shan mountains-MH]. The people there themselves say that at the extremity of the mountain is a desert, and that the said desert is the end of the earth; and in this same desert nobody can have a habitation, because of snakes and wild beasts. On the same mountain there are savages, who are not like other people, and they live there. They are covered all over the body with hair, except the hands and face, and run about like other wild beasts in the mountain, and also eat leaves and grass, and any thing they can find. The lord of the country sent to Edigi [Edigei], a man and a woman from among these savages, that had been taken in the mountain.53 So the idea of wild people in northern Sinkiang and western Mongolia is widespread, and in the immediate area of their supposed habitation they are often known by the name almas or a variant thereof. Further away from this area the same name is applied to a creature or creatures with various otherworldly attributes, though this creature is distiguished from the 'wild people'. The potential for conceptual confusion and intermixing is great, and it is not surprising to find that some of the tales of the almas in Mongolia exhibit some features reminiscent of the more fantastic elements of the tales current in the Pamirs. The Mongolian scholar Rincen reported that in 1928 he spoke to an old woman of seventy who: as a baby left momentarily alone by her mother had been suckled by a naked woman covered with sparse reddish hair, whom her mother had surprised on her return to the yurt ... As the hairy woman ran off her mother noted that the woman's legs were bent, her arms unnaturally long, and that she was pigeon-toed.54 Though outwardly naturalistic, this tale clearly contains elements of the belief that the almas is a threat to mothers and newborn children. The various beliefs and perceptions feed upon one another; and once the ancient Issedonian-Scythian tales reached Greek ears through Aristeas, Greek beliefs could also remodel the original elements of the story.55 In seeking to identify the Arimaspeans we need a hairy people in Central Asia, who Were perhaps one-eyed, were rich in animal stock (notably sheep, cattle, goats and horses), but who had no contact with their neighbours. In the almases we have hairy people in Central Asia, avoiding contact with their neighbours, and whose name is also applied to a variety of mythological beings with a variety of traits, including monocularity. Almases are said to live in association with the wild sheep and goats, in the same region as the wild horse (Przewalski's horse), and are said to suck mares' milk. It is a short step from believing that almases live commensally with the indigenous wildlife to believing that they (being anthropomorphic) have dominion over them. This is suggested by a legend collected by Badzar Baradiin when travelling across the Gobi Desert: Our Alashanians told us that in the sandy regions of Alashan [an area of the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia-M.H.], especially its western half, there are sizable oases with brackish and sometimes even freshwater lakes with splendid pastures. Alashanians live with their herds very wealthily in these oases, which are lost in the most inaccessible depths of wide expanses of sand, and so successfully avoid the persecutions of the authorities, and heavy taxes and duties. The people of these places are very wild and avoid the outside world, they say.i6</page><page sequence="18">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 57 Although this report does not mention the almas, it seems to underlie later accounts which aver that Baradiin actually saw an almas at the time he wrote this journal entry.57 On their characteristics alone, almases make very good candidates for the Arimaspeans. Arimaspeans have been interpreted by classicists as shamanistic beings, an isolated real tribe, 'squinting archers,' and miners with headlamps;58 but there is no need to 'interpret' the sources in this way when their attributes can directly be matched with those of the almases. The remarkable coincidence of their respective names provides further compelling support for the argument. Their phonetic similarity has not been discussed previously, although the etymology of each word has been and continues to be the subject of much speculation. The earliest etymology supplied for the root arimasp- is that given by Herodotus (4.27): he reports that arima is Scythian for 'one' and spu Scythian for 'eye'. This has no support in our present knowledge of Scythian; the Scythian for 'one' was aiva.59 What is lacking in direct Scythian sources can be supplemented by our knowledge of other Iranian languages, notably Old Persian. Tomaschek points to an Iranian proper name Arimafpo, supposedly meaning 'owner of wild/steppe horses' and adduces Avestan airima, 'desert' and the known Scythian aspu, 'horse'. He suggests that the secondary association of 'desert' with 'solitude' is the source of the mistaken attribution by Herodotus of the meaning 'one' to the first element of the word.60 Modern sources are more hesitant, accepting only the link with Iranian aspa, 'horse'. 'Desert horse' (there is no need to postulate the additional semantic element 'owner of.. .') may be acceptable as an etymology, given that almases are said to be found in the same region as the wild Przewalski's horse. Scythian tribes lived in a totemic society (Saka, the Ancient Persian appellation for the Scythians, is a totemic name meaning 'deer'), and their attribution of a similar animal name to the supposed wild people living in association with the wild horses of the desert is quite feasible. 'Desert horse' is certainly much more acceptable than Bolton's speculation of drdm ddk, Mongolian for 'one-eyed'.6' It also provides a basis for the belief that the Arimaspeans were 'horsemen' the phrase originally denoting totemistic affiliation later being interpreted figuratively. However, we must also consider the various etymologies suggested for almas and its variants, and the possible linguistic relation between arimasp- and almas. Almas and its variants have, like arimasp-, been discussed extensively, with greatest emphasis on the forms found in the Pamirs. The most thorough treatment, which also reviews most of the earlier explanations, was published by G. A. Klimov and D. I. Edelman in 197962. The most widely accepted etymologies up to the publication of Klimov's and Edelman's article were those of M. S. Andreev and E. Benveniste. Andreev related the word to the ancient divinity Al and Turkic basty, 'smother';63 Benveniste to the Indo-Iranian demon *Al ('*' denotes a hypothetical, unattested form) with the same Turkic root for the second half of the word.64 Andreev dismisses the form in -m- as a 'variant in popular pronunciation'; Benveniste ignores it altogether. Both see the word as basically an Iranian importation from Turkic. Klimov and Edelman draw attention to the inadequacies of these approaches, especially as regards the variants in -m-: almasty, etc. They point out that the majority of forms in -b- are in Turkic languages, where folk etymologies involving the root -basty identified by Andreev and Benveniste may be at work. Albasty may be explained as a derivative</page><page sequence="19">58 ADRIENNE MAYOR and MICHAEL HEANEY in folk etymology from almasty, but not vice versa. They infer that almasty is the primitive form, and derive that in turn from the name of the Iranian goddess Lamastu/Lamastu, who, like the albasty, threatened breastfeeding children. All of the above etymologies concentrate on the forms ending in -ty, presumably seeing the form almas as derived from them. However, Rincen sees almas as primitive; he writes: The origin of this old name is quite unknown to us: but we can recognise its variations in Turkish languages: Almasty, Albasty, etc ... Albast, Alboosty, also Almasty, are the Turkish forms of Mongol almas with an addition of suffix -t/ty, which only [sc. alone] is explicable.65 Rincen is not explicit, but he probably has in mind the Turkic denominative suffix -di/dy, giving the meaning 'the almas one'. Presumably, like Klimov and Edelman, he would derive albasty secondarily from almasty. If arimasp- and almas are related, we must examine the mechanisms by which both may be derived from a common ancestor, or by which one may be derived from the other. Arimasp- is presented as a word used by the Issedonians, who may have been Scythians, or who may have spoken through Scythian intermediaries. The Iranian languages generally lost the phoneme /Il at an early period in their development (second millennium BC), and it may be that arimasp- reflects a non-Iranian form *alimasp- borrowed into an Iranian language. The history of the Scythian language, however, strongly suggests that arimasp- is a Scythian word. The whole swathe of the Eurasian steppe was inhabited in the first millennium BC by Iranian tribes known under several names, but generally identified by Greeks as Scythians and by Persian sources as Sakas. They penetrated eastwards as far as the Tarim basin in southwestern Sinkiang. Despite their wide distribution it is probable that they all spoke closely related dialects of the same Scythian language; their nomadic way of life minimised the development of divergent speech patterns between communities.66 This linguistic unity did not preclude the use of a variety of tribal names, such as Massagetes, Skolotes, etc. It is quite probable, given their apparent geographical location, that the Issedonians were one of these tribes; this is also suggested by the fact that Ptolemy refers to Issedonian 'trading stations' apparently near Turfan ('Issedon Scythica') and An-hsi (east of Lop Nor, 'Issedon Serica').67 Some modern scholars locate the Issedonians west of the Dzungarian Gate, along the northern slopes of the Tien Shan, in the former Soviet Union; others follow Ptolemy's placement at the eastern foot of the Tien Shan, in oases along the old routes between the Gobi Desert, the Tarim basin, and the Dzungarian Gate.68 Perhaps Ptolemy's two names do no more than reflect the presence of Scythians both north and east of the Tien Shan, which mark the border between the Eurasian steppe and Sinkiang. The Tien Shan formed a barrier between the Scythians on either side of the range; the Scythians of Sinkiang would not have easily participated in the flow of movement which accounts for the linguistic unity of the Scythians of the Eurasian steppe. It is not surprising, therefore, that the language of these Scythians (who gave rise to the Khotan Saka state, with a considerable body of literature, in the second half of the first millennium AD), is thought to have diverged from 'standard' Scythian early on, from about the middle of the first millennium BC. The evidence for the divergence of Khotan Saka is germane to this issue, because it rests on the fact that Khotan Saka did not participate in the sound change Ir'! &gt; /ll, which took place in Scythian towards the end of the first half of the first millennium</page><page sequence="20">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 59 BC (e.g. aryana &gt; alana) The evidence for the date of the change comes from Herodotus, who cites Scythian words not exhibiting the change (e.g. anaries &lt; Sc. anarya) and words showing it (e.g. Kolaxais &lt; Sc. hvaraxsaya). At the time of Aristeas, therefore, a Scythian word arimasp- may have existed, and could have been taken over into Greek. In that form it would have been frozen in the Greek language, not being subject to developments in Scythian phonology; but in the Scythian language it would have developed naturally into *alimasp-. If arimasp- developed into *alimasp-, we may match this against the known developments in Mongolian historical phonology. The difficulty is that history fails us. The known historical phonology of Mongolian takes us back no more than eight hundred years, and we must span two-and-a-half millennia. However, there is some evidence we can adduce. First, almas is not a form which necessarily arises as a result of known developments in Mongolian phonology: it may be ancient in exactly that form. Second, there is evidence that Mongolian has lost unstressed medial /Y/, uilW, e.g. literary Mongolian solbi &lt; *solzbu, cf. the root soli; tu'yurbi &lt; *tuyur'ibu.7? Third, Mongolian now lacks word-final -sp; if it ever existed it has now gone. Ancient Mongolian (ca. AD 1000) lacked the phoneme Ipl entirely: in borrowings of that period, Ipi in isolation becomes l/b/.7 In other words, an original *alimasp- may also be expected to give almas in modern Mongolian. The phonological path traced above from arimasp- to almas suggests that Tomaschek was right to seek an etymology in the Iranian languages. The most straightforward solution is that the name simply means 'desert horse'. The Scythian arimasp-, developing into *alimasp-, accounts for the Mongolian form almas. In the Turkic languages, the form almasti is probably the result of dissimilation from *almaspi, the dissimilation taking place either in Scythian, or after borrowing into Turkic.72 The former is more likely, given that forms in -m- are commonest in the Iranian languages; but it should be pointed out that the present-day Iranian languages of the area are not the linear successors of Scythian, and cultural continuity cannot be presumed. In Turkic languages almasti would then have been subjected to the processes of folk etymology suggested by Klimov and Edelman, producing albasty. The almases of Central Asia, be they mythical or real, match the Arimaspeans of Aristeas in name, appearance, habits, and geography. It is they whom the Issedonians chose as the slayers of the griffins; they who avoided humans, so that the Issedonians never saw the battles themselves, but found only the petrified remains of the vanquished griffins.

Browne, Pseudodoxia epidemica, in The works of Sir Thomas Browne, edited by Charles Sayle (Edinburgh, 1912) 2:1-4; A. Ross, Arcana microcosmi; or, The hid secrets of mans body disclosed . ., with a refutation of Doctor Browns Vulgar errors (London, 1651), p. 283; these are also cited in J. Nigg, The Book of Gryphons (Cambridge, 1982), pp. 87-94. Pliny the Elder mentions that shiny or valuable stones are found in the nests of birds (37.54.146) and eagles (37.39.149). See also G. Bliss, 'Griffins in Medieval Art,' in Survival of the Gods: Classical Mythology in Medieval Art (Providence, R.I., 1987). 2. A. Erman, Travels in Siberia, trans. W. D. Cooley, 2 vols. (London, 1848), 1:87-89. Erman, who received the Royal Geographic Society's medal for his geological studies in Siberia and southern Russia, took an interest in relating Russian customs, language, and oral history to Herodotus's descriptions of the Scythians. See e.g. 1:297-302 and his Fragmens sur Hirodote et sur la Siberie (Berlin, 1834). Erman placed the Arimaspeans in the northern Urals, and translates Aristeas as saying that they 'drew forth the gold from under the Grifons' (Travels 1:88; Fragmens pp. 9-11). Erman visited several locales in the northern Urals where well-preserved mammoth skulls were embedded in alluvial gold-sand mined by the natives (e.g. 1:164, 250-51). As for the Arimaspeans' single eye, Erman considered this 'a misconception or ... embellishment' (1:89). He noted that horns of Rhinoceros teichorinus were locally called 'birds' claws' (1:88). When asked why mammal remains were considered 'birds,' the natives indicated that they realised they were not birds but it was their 'custom' to call them that (1:382). 3. The two modern experts on the Arimaspea (written by Aristeas in about 675 BC) agree that the work 'preserved genuine central Asian folk-lore' (J. D. P. Bolton, Aristeas of Proconnesus (Oxford, 1962), p. 101; see also pp. 84, 93, 176) about griffins and Arimaspeans, 'which survived until modern times among peoples who may be descendants of the originators' (E. D. Phillips, 'The Legend of Aristeas: Fact and Fancy in Early Greek Notions of East Russia, Siberia, and Inner Asia', Artibus Asiae 18 [1955], 177). Phillips, p. 161, calls the Arimaspea an 'excellent example of the use of fable for discovering unexpected facts of history'. In 1848 Erman discussed the similarity between modern Russian expressions and words ascribed to Scythians by Herodotus in the fifth century BC, remarking that although it might seem bold to claim 'national usage' for two thousand years, 'it would be bolder still to maintain' that 'it was merely accidental coincidence' (Travels, 1:297). The remarkable geographic and linguistic continuity of folklore about the Arimaspeans is discussed in the second section of this article. 4. This period, 700 BC-AD 300, also roughly corresponds with the floruit of Scythian culture on the Eurasian steppes. Medieval griffin: Nigg, pp. 53-79; Waltraud Bartscht, 'The Griffin', in Malcolm South (ed.), Mythical and Fabulous Creatures (Westport, Conn., 1987). At some point in the evolution of griffin lore, the eggs were said to be stones or agates; Nigg, p. 51. Griffins' 'stone eggs' and 'claws' were displayed in the Middle Ages, Nigg, pp. 68-72; Bliss, pp. 91; Bartscht, p. 91. 5. H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, Greek English Lexicon (Oxford, 1840), s.v. gryps.

Griffith, Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound (Cambridge, 1983), pp. 230, 266; Liddell and Scott, s.v. aetos. The silence of the sharp- beaked hounds suggests the eeriness of the landscape, and evokes a stony lifelessness in a land littered with victims of the gorgons' petrifying stare. In the play, Arimaspeans are a 'host of one- eyed horse-archers dwelling by streams of Pluto that flow with gold' (Bolton, p. 163). Although the ancients probably had no grasp of the actual time-scale involved in the creation of the fossil record, Hermes's prediction could be read as a metaphor for geological events over millennia.</page><page sequence="22">GRIFFINS AND ARIMASPEANS 61 9. Herodotus, 2.44; 3.116; and Book 4, esp. 4.13ff; 4.24-27. Like Ross (Nigg, p. 93) and Erman (Travels, 1:89), Herodotus doubted that Arimaspeans were monocular: 'But this I hold incredible, that [men would be born with only one eye]' (3.116; see Bolton, p. 194-95, n. 20). Elsewhere (3.102-4) Herodotus related a story about 'gold-mining ants' of northern Kashmir, India, which throw up gold when they burrow in the rich auriferous sand of the desert. His story of the long caravan journey to the desert, the extremely hot days and cold nights, the stealth needed to gather gold nuggets into sacks, has many elements in common with Aelian's much later account of griffins, discussed below. See W. How and J. Wells, A Commentary on Herodotus, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1967), 1:289. The ants have been taken as a doublet or a garbled version of the gold-guarding griffins tale; see Bolton, p. 81; Costello, p. 75. But it is common knowledge among geologists and palaeontologists that precious minerals and small fossils are actually brought to the surface by ants, see e.g. 'Mineralogical Ants,' Zoologist 18 (1859), 7071; C. Clark, The Badlands (New York, 1974), pp. 73-74; Sheldon Judson, geomorphologist emeritus, Princeton University, personal communication, May 1991. 10. Photius, Bibl. 72.46b.30. J. M.

In his treatise of 1646, Browne cited Pliny's doubt (10.70,136) that the griffin was a real bird, Nigg, p. 88. 12. Philostratus, Vita Apollonii, 3.48. The philosopher Apollonius travelled to Asia and India at the end of the first century AD. He said that griffins resembled lions 'in size and strength' and could 'defeat lions, elephants and dragons' but tigers were too swift. Ctesias believed that only lions and elephants could conquer griffins, Bartscht, p. 90. 13. Pausanius 1.24.6. Pausanius related that some believed that griffins were spotted, but rejected this detail, saying 'Those who love to hear marvellous stories cannot resist adding details thus ruining the truth by mixing in lies' (8.2.7). See Bolton, p.65. 14. Aelian 4.27; see Bolton, pp. 65-72. Aelian is the last literary text dealing with the griffin considered here; after his account, which contains the lore of previous texts, no new information about the gryps was added, except for 'agate eggs', mentioned above, note 4, Cf. Stith Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature. Rev. and enl. ed. (Copenhagen, 1955-58), Motifs A2232.4 (griffin disdains Ark, drowns in flood, becomes extinct); B40 (bird-beasts); B42 (griffin); B103.2.1 (treasure- laying animals and birds); B106 (gold under dangerous animal); D428.2.2 (dragon turned to stone); N575 (griffin as guardian of treasure); cf E501.4.1.7 (winged dogs); B756 (gold-digging ants, discussed above, note 9). Aelian makes no mention of Arimaspeans. Some elements in his version appear to reflect rational speculations or observations in griffin territory: e.g. the idea that young griffins would be easier to capture than the adults, whose ferocity is motivated by parental concern, and the uncertainty about griffins' relationship with gold. Large caravans of armed gold-prospectors setting out for a dangerous wilderness over several years, in hope of great profit, is a realistic scenario for gold-finding expeditions in the Gobi, Taklamakan, Dzungarian, and Turfan deserts. Daytime temperatures there are hellish-night would be the only reasonable time to work. Temperatures exceeding 1300F drive desert dwellers to live underground and to travel at night: M.

Greek knowledge about the people and lands beyond Issedonian territory depended on Issedonian 'hearsay' (4.16ff). Issedonians (who apparently controlled the trade routes that passed between the Altai and Tien Shan) had moved west, encroaching on Scythian territory, because of conflict with the Arimaspeans (4.130. When Herodotus recounted the tale that 'Arimaspeans steal gold from griffins who guard it,' he commented that remote lands seem to produce the most rare things, while expressing doubt that Arimaspeans were really monocular (3.113ff). 32. Mines, quarries, and wells are often the sites of fossil discoveries, in antiquity and today. As noted earlier, the Klagenfurt 'dragon' came to light in a quarry, and it was a well-digger in Tegea who found the giant skeleton mentioned by Herodotus. The fossils of Samos may have been discovered by mineral prospectors, see Pliny 35.19.37.

Dale Russell, Canadian Museum of Nature, points out that isolated giant claws of other dinosaur species, which are 'frequently found in the ... Gobi', might be 'incorrectly, but perhaps naturally, linked with the Protoceratops, which tend to be preserved as more or less entire skeletons'. He also notes that the local people were 'very interested' in the huge claws found by the Canadian-Chinese team. Psittacosaurs, which were related to the ancestors of the Protoceratops, had four limbs, with claws and a parrot-like beak; they were about six feet long.

Even though 'fossils tend to break up ... after they are exposed to the elements . . . so many are being exposed all the time' that the chances of seeing recognizable skulls and eggs are good, according to Philip Currie, Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, personal communication, May 1991. The glowing red colour of the wind-sculpted sandstone containing the fossil exposures has inspired the names of badland formations in the Gobi: e.g. Flaming Cliffs (Colbert, p. 233), Red Beds (Andrews, pp. 258-59), Hills of Fire (Cable, p. 183), and more relevant to our present concern, Red Cliff of the Almases (P.

It is interesting that the habits of the gryps as imagined by the ancients anticipated some of the most recent scientific theories about dinosaur behaviour: e.g. the gryps was a very active, agile predator, not a sluggish, reptilian brute; it nurtured its young and fiercely defended the nest (Weishampel et al., pp. 40-41). 37. We thank Sheldon Judson for his clarification of geological processes in this region. 'Fossils are almost always found in sedimentary rocks. Gold is deposited by hydrosolutions in the final stages of intrusive igneous activity.' The auriferous sand originated in the granites of the high mountains; placer gold in a lighter quartz matrix is continually washed down by streams and deposited in the alluvial basins and gullies below. Besides alluvial deposits of gold nuggests, flakes, and dust, colluvial (gravity on slopes) and even aeolian (wind) transport of gold can occur in the desert. When the matrix of quartz and placer gold is eroded, the relatively heavier gold 'settles and is preserved in a sand/gravel alluvial deposit'. Judson, personal communication, May 1991. Under certain conditions, gravel and sand containing older placer gold could overlie some of the younger sedimentary rock, which is associated with fossils, nests, and eggs. The appearance of nuggets actually in 'griffins' nests' is probably an exaggeration based on chance finds of gold near fossil exposures. Geographer Mark Bassin (personal communication, May 1991) and Philip Currie (personal communication, May 1991) offered useful comments on this question. For an excellent topographical map of this region, see the (London) Times Atlas of the World. 38. Cable passed several gold-prospecting and -washing areas skirted by the route between Chia-yii-kuan and Turfan: 'Gold-Washers Halt, Pure Gold Hollow, Pure Gold Rise, Pure Gold Fort, Pure Gold Halt, Land of Gold Dust, Pure Gold Pond' (Cable, pp. 23, 28-29). Modern Russian mineralogists searching for gold in the mid-1800s and in the 1900s were often guided by old place-names; they also exploited the inefficiently worked detritus of Bronze Age gold operations.

Forbes, Metallurgy in Antiquity (Leiden, 1950). 'Sand-gold': Pliny 37.73.188. 39. The logical follow-up might have been 'Only an Arimaspean could fight a live griffin!' The vivid red sandstone (see above, note 35) in which the dinosaurs are found may have suggested 'blood-soaked earth' after a battle; the large fossil bones and red strata on Samos were explained as the corpses and blood of slain giant beings (Plutarch, Greek Questions 56). On folklore connecting red earth with blood, see Halliday, pp. 207-8. Some legends of the gorgons, who could turn living beings to stone, were associated with the territory of the gryps and the Arimaspeans (Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound), which may reflect a magical explanation for the petrified creatures encountered in the region. Several scholars have suggested that the gryps was an Issedonian 'middleman's tale' with no basis in zoological fact, concocted to deter rival gold-seekers (e.g. Phillips [1955], p. 171). Such a tale would be enhanced by observations and souvenirs of impressive fossils. Cable comments that desert traders in the early 1900s knew of a southern shortcut between Kumui (Hami) and Turfan, but the region was feared since antiquity as the 'Valley of Demons' or 'Town of the Dragon', a vast salt desert of mirages, dust 'mists,' and no living animals but 'plenty of demons and strange beings' (p. 97). The shortcut, mainly used by those transporting perishable fruit, would pass through the Turfan basin, where the Late Cretaceous dinosaur exposures are visible. Thirteenth- century Chinese travellers who crossed the deserts between Altai and Tien Shan mentioned supernatural creatures, 'fields of white bones', and 'heaps of very hard and bright white stones like bones' along the caravan routes.

The process may be regarded as both a dissimilation and assimilation: the consonantal sequence -m-sp- has the features labial-dental-labial, which in shifting to -m-st- become labial- dental-dental. The -p- dissimilates from the -m- and assimilates to the -s-. The resultant sequence is phonetically a simpler sequence than the original.</page></plain_text>
