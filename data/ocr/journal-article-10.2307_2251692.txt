<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION BY D. M. ARMSTRONG MOST modern philosophers accept without question the view that motion is purely relative. In this paper, however, I shall try to show that the Relational account of motion involves two distinct contentions. We shall see that one of these contentions is very difficult to deny, but that the second contention seems to involve some problems. This points to the need for a reopening of the dispute. 1. Traditional criticisms of the concept of Absolute Motion The dispute, of course, is a conceptual one. We are not concerned to decide whether moving objects have, or have not, certain properties; rather our concern is with the nature of motion, what motion is. According to the relative view, when we say of a body " it is in motion ", or, " it is at rest ", our statements are really incomplete. Physical objects do not move or remain at rest simpliciter, rather they move or are at rest relative to some other physical object which has been chosen as a point of reference. If the distance between two bodies remains the same over a period of time, then both bodies are at rest during that time, relatively to the other. If the distance alters they move relatively to each other. But unless some body is taken as a point of reference, and the motion or rest of other bodies is measured by the change, or the absence of change, in the distance of these objects from the point of reference, then talk about motion and rest is meaningless. Furthermore, what is at rest relatively to one point of reference may be in motion relatively to another; indeed this must always be the case unless the two points of reference are at rest relatively to each other. Of course there is very often no need to specify our point of reference, because it is perfectly obvious what it is. In ordinary discourse the earth is usually taken as that unspecified point, although not invariably. (We can tell a child to stay where he is in a car that is in motion without implying he is to jump out of the car.) In just the same way we speak of a very large mouse, and we know very well what this means, viz. large as mice go, without having to specify this standard by which we are measuring small and large. But, on the Relative view, talk about motion always implies a material point of reference, whether specified or not, and it will make no sense to ask whether this point of reference is in motion or not, save relatively to some further material point of reference. 209</page><page sequence="2">210 D. M. ARMSTRONG: If we accept this relative account of motion, certain scientific controversies seem to become unreal, or at any rate they com- pletely change their character. As an example let us consider the dispute between the Tychonic and the Copernican systems of astronomy. (Tycho Brahe held that the sun revolves round the earth, while the other planets tevolve round the sun like moons.) Which is the true view? Well, it all depends on what you take as your point of reference. If the earth is taken as point of reference then it is perfectly true that the sun and the planets revolve around the earth. But if we abandon this somewhat egotistical and anthropomorphic point of reference, substituting the sun, then the earth and the planets really do revolve around the sun. Nor is there any sort of contradiction in these two descriptions of what is happening, any more than there is a contradiction in describing the same mouse as large (as mice go), and yet small (as elephants go). In fact the two descriptions of the motions given by the Copernican and the Tychonic systems are logically equiv- ailent; if the earth and the planets move relatively to the sun in the way the Copernicans say they do, then it is logically neces- sary that the sun and the planets move relatively to the earth according to the Tychonic pattern. All this is not to say that there was no point in Copernicus adopting the new point of reference. On the contrary, there were the best of reasons for doing so. It permitted an enorm- ously simplified description of the whole situation from the point of view of dynamics. Furthermore, the similarities that can be discovered between the earth and the planets, and their mutual differences from the sun, made it natural to class them together for the purposes of physical theory. When Tycho Brahe says the earth is the centre of the solar system there seems to be no reason why it should be given this pre-eminence except the biological accident that it is the planet that we inhabit. Hence it is that holding to the relative view of motion we can still say, if we want to, that the Copernican theory is true, and the Tychonic theory false. But our use of the words ' true ' and ' false ' will have to be quite different from ou-r use when we say it is true that there is no life on the moon. We mean simply that taking the sun as point of reference permits an enormous simplification of physical and astronomical theory. The dispute between Tycho Brahe and Copemicus is to be dissolved rather than resolved. Now those who hold that there is absolute motion need not deny that it is perfectly possible to give an account of motions in relative terms. They can admit that we can, and regularly do, measure motions relatively to some material point of reference.</page><page sequence="3">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 211 They can admit, moreover, that in the dispute between Tycho Brahe and Copernicus there is no real dispute about the nature of the relative motions of the bodies involved, the two theories simply being descriptions of the same relative motion from different points of reference. But they would maintain that ,besides motion or rest relatively to some material point of refer- ence there is also the question whether the material points of reference are themselves moving or at rest, a motion or a rest which is not relative to some further material point of reference. Relative to the sun, the earth rotates every twenty-four hours. But is it rotating itself ? The earth moves in an elliptical orbit, relatively to the sun. But is it really moving in an ellipse? IF we could discover this we could discover whether, in respect of absolute motions, the Tychonic or the Copernican hypothesis or neither was the true one. But what could such motion be? What is it for a thing to have absolute motion, or to be at absolute rest ? The answer usually given is that an object's absolulte motion, or lack of it, is deter- mined not by its relation to other material bodies, but by its relation to space. Bodies may move, or not move, but it makes no sense to talk of the motion or lack or motion of space. Here, then is an absolute point of reference. If the body moves relatively to space, if it leaves one place and goes to another, then we can say it has an absolute motion; if not it is at rest absolutely. It would be very unsophisticated to deny that relative motions are real, for the relations of distance that a body has to other bodies can change, but such relative motion would be compatible with the body occupying the same space over a period of time, i.e. being at rest absolutely. Now this sort of view is open to well-known objections. It is an obvious criticism to ask " How would we determine whether or not an absolute motion has taken place ? " It is easy enough to tell whether a thing moves, or does not move, relative to some other thing, but how do we determine whether it is moving relatively to space ? We can perceive that a ship is moving relatively to the earth, and we could describe the same situation by saying that the earth was moving relatively to the ship, although our point of view would be rather an eccentric one. But what observations would determine whether or not the object was moving relatively to space ? In abstraction from material objects space is everywhere the same, it would provide no land- mark by which to determine the presence of absolute motion. It is no use to appeal to material objects to fix absolute position for how could we know that the material objects appealed to have</page><page sequence="4">212 D. M. ARMSTRONG: no absolute motion? A ship may be anchored to a river-bed, but how do we determine that the river-bed is anchored to space ? Newton and the physicists who followed him believed in the reality of absolute rest and motion, but they were aware of these difficulties. Theytriedto meetthemby discovering some. physical characteristics which would differentiate between bodies whose motion was absolute, and those whose motion was merely rela- tive. It seemed possible to find such characteristics in the case of bodies accelerating or decelerating along a straight line, and in the case of rotating bodies. If a train that I am in accelerates or decelerates I shall be thrown backward or forward with a force proportional to the rate of change of motion. A person outside the train (who is accelerating or decelerating relatively to the train) experiences no such forces. It was concluded that the change of motion of the train is therefore a real or absolute change. Again it was argued, we can determine whether or not an object is, or is not, really rotating (as opposed to rotating relatively to some material point of reference) by seeing whether or not it generates centrifugal forces as, e.g. in a rotating bucket of water, where the water mounts the sides of the bucket. The only remaining difficulty was the problem of distinguishing between bodies which are at rest absolutely, and those which had a constant absolute linear velocity. Newtonian mechanics provided no simple test to differentiate between these cases. It seemed, however, that one might utilize the fact that the velocity of light in vacuo was a constant speed, to construct an experiment which should provide a differentiation even here. For if a ray of light were projected along a rigid body, and then back to its starting point on the body, it should take less time in its journey if the absolute motion of the rigid body were in the same direction as the original projection of the light ray, but more time if the absolute motion of the body were in the other direction. But these means of attempting to specify absolute motions were exposed to two lines of objection, the one drawn from scientific work, the other purely conceptual. For our purposes the former is less important and may be dealt with briefly. The Michelson- Morley experiment seemed to show that one could not utilize the constant velocity of light to distinguish between absolute rest and absolute motion with constant velocity. Einstein's Special theory of Relativity made this failure into the basis of his theory which removed the necessity to distinguish between absolute rest and absolute linear velocity within the framework of physics. There remained the physical distinctions which were supposed to differentiate between absolute accelerations, decelerations and</page><page sequence="5">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 213 rotations, on the one hand, and merely relative accelerations, decelerations and rotations on the other. Einstein claimed that the General theory of Relativity removed the need to distinguish between absolute and relative motions even here. An account of the phenomena was to be given purely in terms of the relative motions of the bodies involved. But the real difficulty for the Newtonian answer does not lie in these abstruse scientific considerations at all. It would remain unsatisfactory even if, e.g. the Michelson-Morley experi- ment had had a quite different result; although it might have been harder, psychologically, to see that it was unsatisfactory. The real difficulty is that however many differentiations we may discover that mark off the behaviour of certain physical bodies from others we shall never have any warrant for connecting these differences with differences of absolute motion in the bodies concerned. I rotate a bucket full of water and the water mounts the side of the bucket. Relatively to the rest of the universe, the bucket has rotated; relatively to the bucket, the rest of the universe has circled round the bucket. But the water in the bucket has been affected, while the stars, etc., seem quite un- affected by their enormously fast motion relatively to the bucket. Hence Newton asks us to say that the motion of the bucket is absolute, and that of the stars merely relative. But how do I know that absolute rotation produced such effects, while mere relative motion produces none ? How could I rebut the sugges- tion that the way the water behaved was characteristic of liquid in a container at absolute rest? Newton's view, which correlates the absence of centrifugall force with the absence of absolute motion, and the presence of centrifugal force with, the presence of absolute rotation, where the square of the angular velocity of rotation is proportional to the force, is certainly the simplest and most obvious correlation. But how can I know it is the correct one ? Perhaps the behaviour of the bucket is due to some other unobserved factor, and the presence or absence of absolute motion in a body has no effect on its behaviour. In order to settle these doubts would we not need to observe directly the relationship between the bucket and space ? But this, it seems, is just what we cannot do. Surely, then, the scientific thing to do is to forget about absolute rest and motion and, as Einstein did, look for an account of the different behaviour of bodies within the framework of relative motions only. We could, of course, establish it as a convention that two bodies which were 1 This term is used here for convenience although strictly it begs the question.</page><page sequence="6">214 D. M. ARMSTRONG: rotating relatively to other bodies, and which displayed centri- fugalforces, were to be said to have absolute rotation. But then the meaning of the phrase will be exhausted by the phenomena which Newton took to be the mere effects of absolute motion. On such a view the postulation of absolute motion becomes a harmless affair, standing in no opposition to the claim that all motion is merely relative. It amounts to no more than saying that some bodies which are rotating relatively to other bodies behave differently from other rotating bodies. So far, then, we have been expounding the Relational criticism of the view that material bodies, besides having spatial relations to other material bodies, also move or are at rest relatively to space. It was pointed out that change or absence of change in the latter relation is completely unobservable. The attempt to escape this difficulty made by Newtonian physics is uncon- vincing. But if this relationship of material objects to space is un- observable in principle may we not argue that there is no such relationship ? Newton pictured space as a sort of container, physical objects were in this container, but the container's existence was logically independent of the existence of the material objects. If this picture is correct it seems we must be able to talk of the relations the thing has to space. But, it may be argued, this is a radically mistaken picture. What is space, we might ask, save the assemblage of material, that is extended, objects, and their spatial interrelations ? When you have this assemblage you have all there is to have: there is no question of Space over and above these interrelations. To postulate such a container is to suffer from metaphysical double vision, it is to be misled by the substantive ' Space ' into demanding a substance. Hence, it may be argued, the absolute points of reference required for absolute rest and motion do not even exist. The points we have been making may be driven home by con- sidering the conceptual possibility that the universe contains only one material body.1 What possibility could there be of determining whether it moves or it rests as a whole ? By hypothesis, there are no other bodies which can serve as points of reference, so we cannot have changes in its relations to other bodies. It might behave differently at different times, but what conceivable warrant would there be for connecting these changes in behaviour with absolute rest and motion ? Does not this I There are certain difficulties in this conception which will not be examined here. But the previous argument stands even if this possibility be rejected.</page><page sequence="7">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 215 make it quite clear that apart from the existence of other bodies to serve as points of reference, motion and rest are meaningless notions ? 2. A supressed premise in the argument against Absolute Motion Up to this point our argument has followed a well-worn track, and perhaps it seems now that there is little more to say. But in fact we have failed to notice one line of reply that might be attempted by those who uphold the intelligibility of the conceptions of absolute motion and rest. Let it be granted that it is inconceivable that the relations of a material object to space could be determined, and that it therefore makes no sense to talk of such a relation. Nevertheless, besides having spatial parts, each numerically different from each other, physical objects also have temporal phases. And although we speak of the numerical identity of the same object at different times, there is a clear and important sense in which the different temporal phases of the very same object are numerically different. So even if there were only one body in the universe, or, putting the point more cautiously, even if we abstracted from the other bodies that existed, why could we not ask " What are the spatial relations holding between the different temporal phases of that object ? " It may well be senseless to ask whether the object does or does not occupy the same portion of absolute space at the two different times. But why cannot we ask whether the object at the later time is or is not at a distance from the same object at an earlier phase ? Here there seems to be no question of absolute space involved, but simply a relation that holds between the two numerically different phases of the same object. If the object at the later time is at no distance from the object at the earlier time, then the object has not moved. After all, we find no difficulty in the idea that objects at a spatial distance from each other, are at no temporal distance from each other, i.e. exist simultane- ously. So why not allow that objects that are at a temporal distance from each other (as different phases of the same thing are) can be at no spatial distance? To the relation 'being simultaneous with ' corresponds the relation ' being at no distance from '. Now the upholder of the Relational theory of motion would reject this suggestion as nonsensical. But his reasons for doing so require examination. Suppose that at a certain time T1, an object, say a person, is at a certain distance from other objects,</page><page sequence="8">216 D. M. ARMSTRONG: say the walls of a room. The notion of distance is clearly one that stands in needs of much discussion and elucidation, but two points about it are clear. In the first place distances, where not too great, can be directly observed. I can see that at a certain time I am roughly twice as far from one wall as I am from the other. In the second place (and this is the really important point for our purposes), we ordinarily think that to say that at a certain moment I am a certain distance from the walls, is not to make an incomplete statement. We would not say that relative to one system of reference I am twice as far from one wall as another, but that relative to another system that is not so. We cannot say that a certain object is made of gold relative to one system of reference, but that relative to another it is made of silver. Either it is made of gold or it is made of silver, and that is that. In the same way either I am at a certain distance from the walls, or I am not. But, the Relational theorist will argue, all this changes when we come to say that I am at a certain distance from where I was some time ago. What this means is that at T1 I am a certain distance from the walls at T1 but that at T2 I am at a different distance from the walls at T2. I can only say that I am now at a distance from where I was relatively to the walls. Whether or not I am at a distance from where I was depends on the system of reference adopted. Relative to the room my position may be unaltered. Relatively to the sun it certainly is altered. What this brings out is that to talk of the distances between objects that exist at different times is a very different matter from talking of distances between objects that exist at the same time. The latter statements are complete, but the former need to be filled out by giving the system of reference (the room, the sun) for which they are true. Hence, the Relational theorist will say, if we take the case where the universe contains but a single body, it may make sense to talk about the distances between different points on the body at one particular time, but it makes no sense to talk about the distances between the object at one phase and the object at another. To talk about that we would need what, by hypo- thesis we have not got, other bodies to serve as systems of reference. It is convenient to introduce two technical terms here. We shall say that objects which are spatially related in the way that objects that exist at the same time are related, all have a direct spatial relation. (When I say spatial relation I am thinking primarily of distance.) But where objects are spatially related in the sort of way that the Relational theory asserts that objects</page><page sequence="9">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 217 that exist at different times are spatially related they have an indirect spatial relation. The justification of the terms should be pretty clear. As we have seen, indirect spatial relationship presupposes the notion of direct spatial relationship. To talk of my now being at a distance from where I was, or where the wall was, the relational theory asserts that I must refer to direct spatial relations between myself and objects that hold at the two times. But we could conceive situations where the concept of direct spatial relationship would have application, but the concept of indirect spatial relationship have none. Suppose that every recognizable landmark in the universe was obliterated. The objects in the brave new world would still have direct spatial relations to each other. But we could not talk of the spatial relations of the objects in the new world to objects in the old one. In order to do this there would have to be some object which had not altered which could serve as. a point of reference by which we could measure the change or absence of change in direct spatial relationship. In this supposed situation, then, when there is no such continuously existing point of reference, the notion of indirect spatial relationship between objects before and objects after the deluge would have no application. We have now made some very important progress. We con- sidered how the Relational theory of motion would deal with the contention that even if the universe contained but a single body the different phases of this -body might be spatially related. It was brought out that the Relational theory, as ordinarily understood, involves two separate contentions. Firstly it asserts that there is no such thing as space which exists independently of the spatial relations material objects have to each other. But secondly it asserts that objects that exist at two different times can only be indirectly spatially related, in the sense which we have given to the phrase 'indirect spatial relation.' To say " He is now three feet from where the wall is " is a complete statement. Whatever complexities may be involved in the analysis of such statements, they do not require to be supple- mented by mentioning a standard of reference. But to say " He is now three feet from where he was ", or " from where the wall was ", is to make an incomplete statement. It needs to be supplemented by stating the point of reference which is being used. These two parts of the Relational theory do not just come to the same thing. It is true that if the Absolutist view that space is something more than material objects in spatial relations is correct, then there would be a direct spatial relationship between bodies that exist at different times. For bodies that</page><page sequence="10">218 D. M. ARMSTRONG: existed at two different times would either be or not be at the same place in absolute space. " I am now where I was " could function as a complete statement. Now this means that the second Relational contention, viz. that objects that exist at different times are indirectly spatially related only, impliesthe first Relational contention, the rejection of the notion of space as something more than the spatial relationships of physical objects. But the reverse implication does not seem to hold. Could we not reject the notion of Absolute space as something more than the spatial relation of material objects, and yet still assert that objects that existed at different times were directly related spatially? That is, could we not reject the 'container' view of space, yet say that, to put it in the formal mode, " I am at no distance from where I was " or " I am now at no distance from where the chair was " could be complete statements ? It would simply be a matter of objects having a certain relation to each other, withouit any question of absolute space. This completes the first task of this paper, to show that the Relational theory of motion does not simply depend on the re- jection of Absolute Space, taken as something over and above material objects and their spatial relations. To establish the Relational theory we need the further premiss that objects that exist at different times are 'indirectly' spatially related only, that " A at T1 is at a certain distance from B at T2 " (allowing the possibility that A and B are different phases of the same body) must be an incomplete statement. The latter assumption is perhaps perfectly correct, but it does not seem to follow from the rejection of Absolute Space. So it seems that we have brought to light a suppressed premiss in the Relational argument. 3. Can objects that exist at different times be ' directly' spatially related ? Now, if I am correct in thinking that the Relational theory of motion involves not one but two contentions about the nature of motion, this is most important for the dispute between the Absol- ute and the Relational view. It means that we are not faced with a straight choice between the two theories, for perhaps there is something right and something wrong about each of them. Now for the reasons already given in part 1, it seems impossible to accept the absolutist view that objects move, or fail to move, relative to an ultimate standard of reference, Space. But must we therefore accept the Relational view that there can be no direct spatial relations between objects existing at different times ?</page><page sequence="11">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 219 This seems to me to be a much more difficult and controversial point. All I shall do here is to try to open up the question by putting forward some arguments for and against the view that objects that exist at different times are indirectly spatially related only. For. The arguments in favour of saying that only objects that exist simultaneously can be directly spatially related are very simple. It seems that we never perceive direct spatial relations between objects that exist at different times. Do we ever observe that an object is or is not in the same place that it was a moment ago ? We may certainly observe that its relations to some given point of reference (for instance, the earth) have changed, but it seems that we never observe direct spatial relationship of the sort that we do observe to hold between simultaneously existing objects. If we could make such observa- tions there would be no Newtonian problem of finding physical tests to determine what objects are really moving. Observation would be enough. But, furthermore, it seems that it is not that we just fail to observe these relations, rather, it seems we do not even know what it would be like to do so. What would it be like to observe that there was a spatial gap between the place I am in now and the place I was in a tenth of a second before, without referring to some continuously existing standard of reference ? Can we understand this ? It is tempting to say that we cannot, that the motion of direct spatial relationship demands that terms of such a relation must exist simultaneously. For this reason we must take the Relational view very seriously. Against. Now I think that anybody who maintains that objects which exist at different times do have direct spatial re- lations must admit that these relations are not, in general, observed. Yet they can hardly admit that they are unobservable in principle, for if they do so they will have to meet the same sort of devastating criticism as that brought against the notion of absolute space. So they will have to maintain that we can understand what it would be to observe such relations, even if we never actually do so. And there are some real difficulties for the contention that only objects that exist simultaneously can be directly spatially related; which lends some support to this view. (i) The first objection to this Relational doctrine of motion is based on cases where an object is rotating. Even apart from any physical differences such object may exhibit, it seems a very strange thing to say that when the object can be described as rotating in a full circle it is equally correct, if less convenient, to describe the situation by saying that the whole material universe 15</page><page sequence="12">220 D. M. ARMSTRONG: circles round the object. Surely this is not just a matter of convention, to be settled by taking the most convenient, or least eccentric, point of reference ? Now if we allowed the direct spatial relation of things that existed at different times (say, the rotating object at two different times) there would be a real question whether the object had actually rotated, or whether the universe had moved round it. If the object really rotated, then, from moment to moment, the parts of the object would be at a distance from themselves at the previous moment. It must be admitted, however, that taken by itself this objection does no more than express a feeling of dissatisfaction with the Relational view, a feeling not really backed by argument. (ii) A further objection to the view that only the simultaneous can be directly spatially related is based on the notion of spatio- temporal continuity. It is part of our common-sense concept of a thing that its existence is spatio-temporally continuous. It never leaps gaps in either time or space. Temporal continuity is a straightforward matter which needs no extended considera- tion here. A thing does not cease to exist, and then come into existence after a time-interval. Spatial continuity is also a straightforward matter, provided we allow direct spatial relation- ship between objects that exist at different times. But suppose we deny that possibility of such relations, what sense can we make of spatial continuity? Well, what is it for a thing to remain in the same place, or to make a continuous transition from one place to another ? As we have already seen, on the Relational view 'at the same place 9 can only be given a sense relative to some material point of reference. If A is directly spatially related to the point of reference B at a certain instant, and it retains exactly those relations during later instants, then relative to B it has not changed its place. If the spatial relations of A to B change continuously from instant to instant, A moves relatively to B, And since a thing can have spatial continuity only if it remains in the same place, or else changes its position continuously, we can say that under these circumstances A has spatial continuity relative to B during the time in question. In other words, if the Relational view is correct we shall have to give quite asymmetrical accounts of temporal and spatial con- tinuity. And the Relational account of spatial continuity leads to some rather strange consequences. Firstly, on the Relational view of spatial continuity, it is logically possible that while relative to object B object A has spatial continuity, yet points of reference might be found from which A at an earlier time and A at a later time were not spatially</page><page sequence="13">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 221 continuous, and so, in fact, were not phases of the same thing at all. In other words, if we hold the relational view, the notion of being numerically the same thing, when applied to two objects existing at different times, seems not to be an absolute description at all, but depends on the point of reference adopted. This seems to disrupt our ordinary notions of numerical identity. Secondly, we will be unable to answer the question whether the point of reference which we use in determining spatial con- tinuity is itself spatially continuous or not. If the poinit of reference is a certain room, then calling the room at T1 and the room at T2 the very same thing cannot be a matter of spatial continuity. Relative to this point of reference we can say that other-objects exhibit spatial continuity, but it makes no sense to raise the same question about the room. The basis for calling it the same room must rest on other factors: perhaps the close similarity of the object at TJ and the object at T2. There will be temporal continuity, but there cannot be spatial continuity. We can, of course, discover that relative to some new point of reference, the room at one time is spatially continuous with the room at another, but then the same question arises about this new point of reference. But do we not demand spatial continuity even of our point of reference ? However, I do not think either of these objections is conclusive. In answer to the first point the Relational theorist may urge that although it is possible that there should be points of reference from which what we treat as spatially continuous would be spati- ally discontinuous, yet as a matter of fact there are no such awk- ward points of reference (at any rate in dealing with macroscopic objects). This may be seen to be true when we reflect that a point of reference from which ordinary objects seemed to lack spatial continuity would itself seem to lack spatial continuity when ordinary objects were taken as the points of reference. It might then be said our ordinary notion of spatial continuity builds into itself the admittedly contingent fact that no such awkward points of reference present themselves. This seems a sufficient reply. In answer to the second point, that on the Relational view we cannot say that our points of reference are themselves spatially continuous, the Relational theorist may try to soften the blow by pointing out that if, e.g. this chair exhibits spatial continuity relative to the room as point of reference, then equally the room exhibits spatial continuity relative to the chair. It is true that we could go on to ask whether the whole complex of room-and- chair was spatially continuous, and that the question could only be answered if the room and chair were taken as part of a still</page><page sequence="14">222 D. M. ARMSTRONGt: wider whole. But in the end all the Relational view will have to do is to deny that we can give any sense to saying that the universe as a whole is spatially continuous with itself at different times. If anything less than everything is taken as the point of reference, then, if there are objects that are spatially continuous relative to it, it will itself be spatially continuous relative to these objects. It seems, then, that the Relhtional view can give a workable account of spatial continuity, even if this account exhibits some rather curious features quite unlike the parallel notion of temporal continuity. (iii) But there is a more powerful objection to the view that only things that exist simultaneously can be directly spatially related. It seems that the doctrine that only the simultaneous can be directly spatially related will have to restrict simultane- ity to absolute simultaneity. We cannot make exceptions in favour of very short time intervals. This would be simply arbitrary. There can be no question of a Spatial relation between an object at T1 and another object a hundredth of a second earlier, save via direct spatial relations that each has at the two two different instants to some point of reference with a continuous existence during that interval. Putting the point another way: the Relational theory holds that, e.g. "'I am now five feet from the chair now "' is a complete statement, but that "' I am now five feet from the chair then"' is an incomplete statement requiring to be supplemented by giving a point of reference. The logic of the two statements is different in this respect. But it seems that the ' now' in the first statement must be the 'now' of absolute simultaneity, for if an interval of time is in question what must be meant is that at each instant of that time I have the same spatial relation to the chair at that instant. What seems to emerge from this is that the Relational theory forces us to take a ' cinematograph ' view of motion and of rest. To move will be a matter of having certain spatial relations to a thing at a certain instant, and then having different spatial relations to the thing at later instants. A similar account will have to be given of rest. Now this account of the nature of motion and rest seems to force us to treat time as actually made up of an ordered series of durationless instants. A finite duration will have to consist of a finite or infinite number of such instants. Now against such a view of time, thinkers since Zeno of Elea have brought important objections. We need not rehearse these objections here, but may remain content to point out that the Relational view of motion seems to be committed to such a view of time, with any difficulties it may entail.</page><page sequence="15">ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MOTION 223 (iv) The difficulty here may be supplemented by a further objection based on certain empirical discoveries about perception. If we consider our field of view, all the objects that we perceive at a particular instant appear to exist simultaneously. And we can certainly observe some of the direct spatial relations that they have to each other: this is to the left of that, this is roughly three feet from that. But physicists tell us that light has a finite velocity, which means that the things I am observing at any particular moment, although they appear as simultaneous, are not quite simultaneous, because they are at different distances from my eye. (This time-gap is very conspicuous when I am seeing the sun set behind a hill: the seen hill and the seen sun are really some minutes apart in time. But it is involved in all perception.) Now this seems to mean that I am actually observing direct spatial relations which obtain between objects which I have good scientific reason to believe are not simultane- ous. Yet vision is my normal way of discovering the spatial relations of things. This objection might be met if it were denied that we had any direct perception of physical objects; that is, if it were denied that the objects in my field of view could be identified simply with physical objects. But if a Realistic account of perception is accepted it would be a real difficulty. Here is a dilemma then. On the one hand it seems that we cannot say what it would be like for objects that are not sim- ultaneous to be directly spatially related; or, putting it in the formal mode, it seems that we cannot understand "' I am now five feet from where the chair was ' " as a complete statement. Yet,- on the other hand, to take the other horn of the dilemma exposes us to the objections that we have been rehearsing. The third and perhaps the fourth of these objections seem extremely serious. But whatever the solution of this problem, I hope to have shown that the assumptions behind the Relational theory of motion are complex, involving both the rejection of Absolute Space as a sort of unmoving universal container, and the rejection of the notion that objects that exist at different times are' directly' spatially related. This second assumption is independent of the first, and it would require to be established or rejected on inde- pendent grounds. Investigation of this second assumption has been attempted in a preliminary way in the third section of this paper. liniversity of Melbourne</page></plain_text>
