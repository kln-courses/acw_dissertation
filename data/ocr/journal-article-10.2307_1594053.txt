Photograph, The Brooklyn Museum. DURING MOST OF THE SECOND QUARTER of the nineteenth century, Henry Inman (1801- 1846) was considered the foremost figure in the art life of New York, the quintessential Knickerbocker painter. He was, and was so considered, primarily a portraitist (Fig. 1), and a great one. Indeed, he shared with Thomas Sully of Philadelphia, his con- WILLIAM H.

But Inman was more than a portrait painter, and perhaps the most oft-quoted story told of this much-recorded artist pertains to his great versatil- ity; it was reported by Dunlap, as told to him by Sully: "I remember going round your exhibition of the Na- tional Academy at Clinton Hall, in New York, and seeing a fine landscape, I asked, 'Who painted this?' The answer was, 'Inman.' Then I came to a beautiful group of figures-'Ah, this is very clever-let us see whose this is.' I looked at my catalogue, -'Inman.' Then some Indians caught my eye-catalogue again--'Inman,' A little further on, and I exclaimed, Gerdts / Inman 26</page><page sequence="2">'By George, here is the finest miniature I have seen for many a day!' it was a lady in black. 'Who is this mi- niature painter?' 'Inman' His large portraits I was ac- quainted with, but this variety of style took me alto- gether by surprise."' And writers quoting this would go on to speak of Inman's role in the development of lithography in America. Yet, despite the amazement of Sully, Dunlap and others at the variety of Inman's artistic pro- duction, the great numbers of pictures produced by him that are known today are his large por- traits; followed by a not inconsiderable group of miniature portraits. His landscape production seems to have been small, and even some of those recorded in contemporaneous exhibition cata- logues, and described in glowing terms in the New York press, are unlocated. Sully aside, however, Inman was never espe- cially vaunted as a landscape painter, nor was he credited with any seminal role in the development of landscape in this country. It is quite another matter, however, with his role as a genre painter. His work here was uniformly admired as an ex- traordinary achievement during his lifetime, and appears to have contributed to the survival of his reputation after his early death. In 1855, he was recorded as one of the precursors of a new school of realism in America,2 and this must certainly re- fer to his role as a genre painter, rather than his in- volvement in any other thematic area. More specifically, in 1876 at the time of the Philadelphia Centennial, he was hailed as ". . . the first Ameri- can artist who attempted genre with suc- cess...."3 Five years later, he was listed as a founder of a short-lived American school, and was linked with William Sidney Mount, William Ran- ney, George Comegys and Richard Caton Wood- ville-a grouping that, today, would be considered quite motley. The unifying thread of the group was, of course, a devotion to genre.4 And finally, in 1893, Clara Clement wrote that Inman was re- membered as a genre painter.5 Such a tribute is not likely to find repetition in art historical writing today. Nor should it; rather, what is surprising is that such a reputation should be gained on the basis of little more than half a dozen paintings, and even here the majority of these were painted in the last five or six years of In- man's life. By then, in the early 1840s, William Sid- ney Mount had already devoted himself for a dec- ade, with increasing success in both aesthetics and reputation, to the theme of genre, and it had been two decades since the death of John Lewis Krim- mel, America's first genre specialist. These, respec- tively considered "The American Wilkie" and "The American Hogarth," were our earliest genre painters, not "The American Lawrence." It may be instructive then, to consider the sur- viving genre paintings by Inman; to attempt to analyze his role in the development of this theme; and to ascertain how his seminal relationship in this development grew, howevermuch that reputa- tion was incorrect. Unlike his landscape paintings and, of course, his enormous portrait production, exhibition records of the time do not suggest that we are today lacking many crucial examples of his genre art. And even a number of his missing figure pictures are known from contemporary engrav- ings, for which medium at least some of these pic- tures were created. One factor which must be taken into account in regard to Inman's reputation.as a genre painter is the definition of the theme itself. As Wolfgang Stechow has brilliantly pointed out in a recent, posthumously published article, "genre" as a term to describe scenes of everyday life appears to have been specified for the first time in 1791 in the writ- ings of Quatremere de Quincy, and it was only in the 1830s and '40s that it began to gain widespread international acceptance-this, at exactly the peri- od of its popular and critical appreciation in this country, and the corresponding production of In- man's genre pictures.6 This attitude toward genre is not merely a matter of semantics or terminology. In the critical hierarchy of themes as laid down by the French Academy in the seventeenth century, further codified by Sir Joshua Reynolds in his Discourses at the end of the eighteenth century, and repeated by such early nineteenth century American critics as Daniel Fanshaw, original artistic conceptions ranked from historical compositions as the highest 1.

But even as such hierarchical conventions were acknowledged in America, and despite the fact that historical painting continued to be deemed the superior branch of the fine arts until the Civil War, genre painting continued to gain in popularity until, by mid-century, such art patrons as the directors of the American Art-Union ac- knowledged the dichotomy between the popularity of genre scenes and the moral purposefulness of historical works in their acquisition of pictures for disbursement by lottery and reproduction in en- graving. The reason for genre's surge of appeal, not only on the popular but also the critical level, was not difficult to understand. Historical painting was rooted in past traditions learned in Europe by American art students and was reflective of con- temporary and Old Master, European painting. Furthermore, much of the subject matter of histo- ry painting was either abstruse and incomprehen- sible, or devolved from European history, essen- tially alien to the American experience, while America itself had precious little history suitable for pictorial expression. But while at first, in the early years of the nineteenth century, America's glory was seen to reside in her natural wonderland, gradually fascination was aroused in the multiplic- ity of her people. Class distinctions, a la Hogarth, were usually vigorously denied, but the diversity of the nation's populace was seen increasingly as material suitable for the brush of the artist.8 While the impetus for such expression ultimately stemmed from the amazing popularity of the paintings, and, in America, the engravings after the paintings of the Scotsman, Sir David Wilkie, a growing demand developed for a like expression of the many facets of authentic national life and character in the new republic of the United States. Just as Wilkie's art was seen as a pictorial equiva- lent of the national and local emphasis given to lit- erature by Scotland's preeminent and equally pop- ular writer, Sir Walter Scott, so a call arose for art- ists to create a body of painting expressive of the America that was being rendered in literary form by Washington Irving and James Fenimore Coop- er. Irving, Cooper and Scott were the most popu- lar authors in America in the second quarter of the nineteenth century; we tend today to forget that David Wilkie was probably the most famous and most revered painter of the Anglo-Saxon world af- ter about 1810, and, for that matter, that his and Scott's influence penetrated deeply into artistic consciousness on the Continent as well. One aspect of this which weighs heavily in the estimation of Inman's fame as a genre painter is the initial lack of distinction between genre and lit- erary illustration. Today it is easy enough to recog- nize that distinction: literary painting derives from the imagination of an author, and while some au- thors appear to have had a "pictorial imagina- tion"-Irving, Cooper and Scott all did-their lit- erary themes were often drawn from tradition, leg- end and history, while the genre painter was basi- cally inspired by observation of scenes of everyday life. Nevertheless, in the context of the early nine- teenth century, both the artists of genre and the writers of prose, poetry and drama tended to be united in the exploitation of native peculiarities and the creation of a national artistic tradition in- herent in America and divorced from European customs and mores, however much the art itself might derive from, and depend upon, the exam- ples set by a Wilkie or a Scott. Furthermore, the blur between genre and literary painting was fur- thered by a lack of any recognition of literary painting within the hierarchic thematic scale also, although it would have been recognized closer to historical significance than genre, and thus of su- perior purpose. Also, one aspect of historical painting was gradually to develop a kinship with genre painting by the 1850s in America: a form of "genre-ized history," for which Inman produced one once-famous early example-Early Days of Washington, illustrated in Figure 18 and discussed later. Although we still lack a definitive study of In- man's life and art, the basic outline of his career is well-known, and need not be repeated here.9 Suffice to say that he trained as an apprentice with John Wesley Jarvis during the second decade of 7. Fanshaw's enumeration of a thematic scale of artistic value is detailed in a review of the 1827 National Academy of Design exhibition in The United States Review and Literary Gazette, 1827, p. 244. 8. See, for instance, the review of James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Spy, in the North American Review, July, 1822, pp. 250-253, and the-well known remarks on the subject by Ralph Waldo Emerson in "The Poet," The Works of Ralph Waldo Emer- son, ed. by J. E. Cabot, 1883, Volume III, pp. 40-41. 9. The most definitive study of Inman to date is Theodore Bol- ton, "Henry Inman, an Account of His Life and Work," and, "Catalogue of the Paintings of Henry Inman," Art Quarterly, Autumn, 1940, pp. 353-375, and Supplement, pp. 401-418.

Photograph, the author. the nineteenth century, at which time Jarvis was New York's leading portraitist, a role that Inman was to assume by the end of the 1820s. As Inman's apprenticeship was coming to an end by 1820, he was probably working a good deal upon the back- grounds and other less crucial parts of Jarvis' por- trait canvases,10 and by the early 1820s they had entered into an informal partnership, Inman painting miniatures while Jarvis painted portraits in large. Inman's success in Boston in 1822, greater than that of his former teacher, marked the begin- ning of an almost unimpeded rise in fame and popularity for nearly two decades. But even before his emergence from his ap- prenticeship, Inman was venturing beyond the confines of portraiture which, however, in 1820 was still the only form of painting that appeared financially sound and occasionally lucrative. In the 1846 memorial exhibition held after Inman's death to aid his widow and children, a painting of Maria from Laurence Sterne's Sentimental Journey was exhibited by James L. Graham, with the anno- tation that it was painted in boyhood, or, according to the critic in Littell's Living Age, at the age of 18-thus dating from 1819. All who commented upon the work found it crude in execution, while C. Edwards Lester saw no evidence that it was by Inman; he had never heard of it previously, nor did he find any similarity with Inman's earliest doc- umented figure painting. More serious and dam- ning were the comments of the deceased artist's brother, John Inman, editor of the Commercial Ad- vertiser, who saw no evidence of Henry Inman's au- thorship although he recalled other crude efforts and copies that the painter created. Yet, given both Inman's English and literary proclivities, such a subject in his early oeuvre would not seem improba- ble.1 Inman made a few forays into literary illustra- tions of the work of other early authors; there exist several drawings and records of a number of paint- ings relating to Ovid, Shakespeare, Cervantes and others.12 However, his early and growing involve- 10. The background and other areas of Jarvis' Portrait of Daniel Tompkins, painted about 1820 and now in The New-York His- torical Society, would suggest Inman's participation in the scin- tillating brushwork which is more typical of the apprentice's style than the master's. 11.

In- man's Rip Van Winkle Awakening from his Long Sleep (Fig. 2) was exhibited in 1823 at the American Academy of the Fine Arts; it is one of the earliest known representations of an Irving subject in American art and predates such involvement by Inman's fellow Jarvis apprentice, John Quidor. The present author has described more fully else- where the Inman-Irving connection.13 The work appears to have remained with Inman into the ear- ly 1840s but, by the time of his memorial exhibi- tion, it was lent by William Crittenden and four years later it was in the fifth annual exhibition of the Albany Gallery of Fine Arts. Less well known are Inman's first pictorializa- tions of the work of James Fenimore Cooper, a se- ries of illustrations of the author's novels, The Spy and Pioneers which appeared in The Port Folio be- tween 1823 and 1824 (Fig. 3). These are rather awkward, crudely delineated figure compositions. Admittedly, it is difficult in such cases to decide whether the inadequacies stem from the deficien- cies of the original designer or of the engraver, but it is probable that Inman's own inexperience is at least partly at fault. Nevertheless, his appearance here established the young artist in relationship to the major American novelist of his time and an art- ist working in a realm other than portraiture; as the engravings of two of the illustrations were done by Cephas Childs, it also brought Inman into contact with an influential printmaker who was to become one of his closest friends and a future busi- ness partner. Moreover, these were among the earliest American illustrations of belles lettres and, as such, they must have put Inman's name and talents be- fore the American art world and established him as a young artist of ambition. There is no reason to suppose that Inman's original works were any oth- er than drawings because no oil paintings of these subjects have ever appeared, unlike the presum- ably later Dolph Heyliger from Irving's Bracebridge Hall, unlocated today and known only from its ex- hibition at the American Art-Union in 1847, the year after the artist's death. On the other hand, In- man's name was associated with other figural com- positions reproduced in these early years, such as William Samuel Cardell's Story of Jack Halyard, the Sailor Boy, or, The Virtuous Family, published in 1825, of which a Maverick engraving after Inman shows a boatman rescuing children from the water. Actually, the greatest number of Inman's figu- ral and genre works occur in the graphic field. The purpose of these is often unclear. Some may have been done for his own amusement or just as prac- tice drawings; others would seem to be illustrative, such as his Man in the Snow (Fig. 4), signed but un- dated, and in Inman's typically nervous, calli- graphic style, with an anthropomorphic tree echo- ing the frantic gesture of the supine figure, slightly in the manner of Quidor. The actual purpose of 13. "Inman and Irving: derivations from Sleepy Hollow," An- tiques, November, 1958, pp. 420-423. Gerdts / Inman _ej-.z nea C vuf.' i-/7. zn2.man.

The origins of oth- er Inman sketches are far less mysterious, such as his elegant 1826 drawing of The Forest Hymn (Fig. 5), which illustrates one of the artist's own poetic productions. In The Forest Hymn, an upright hunt- er leans upon the massive trunk of a fallen tree amidst the solitude of the forest wilderness. Both Inman's drawing and poem reflect the emergent aesthetic of the early romantic landscape school of Thomas Cole, Charles Codman and others, al- though the artist's particular style of delicate, sinu- ous line and vignette-like composition wherein defined forms evaporate toward the outer edge of an implied ovoid enframement, betrays rococo im- plications best seen in contemporary American art in the landscapes of Joshua Shaw. There are also genre drawings, some quite humorous in nature, which were produced in connection with the New York Drawing Association and later with the Sketch Club, communal artistic efforts by artists in- volved with Knickerbocker club life of the 1820s and '30s. Another of Inman's youthful graphic works is his Children in the Park (Fig. 6), a watercolor and pencil sketch of 1824. Again, figures are placed within a woodland setting. This time it is a contrast of a sweet, dark-haired girl and a blond boy, with appropriate attributes-hers, a basket of flowers; his, a hobby horse, both symbols of the divergent, passive and active roles the children will play in their maturity. This is even more typical of In- man's interests and achievements in the area of genre, for it involves children. Indeed, the draw- ing already marks Inman's definition of the state of childhood-a period and a realm of bliss and inno- cence which marks the greatest number of his genre pictures in all media, and which character- izes major portrait groups of children as well: The Livingston Children of c. 1828 (seen in Fig. 1); The Ray Children, 1839, (private collection); and The Children of Bishop Doane, 1834-35 (The Newark Museum). The Children in the Park, in fact, foreshadows another group of Inman illustrations, those con- nected with the gift books or annuals, elegantly- bound Christmas offerings so popular on both sides of the Atlantic between about 1825 and 1860. Inman was not one of the major illustrators of such volumes but he did a number of them for the best of the books. The spirit of Children in the Park is not unlike the sentimental illustration, The Sister (Fig. 7), published in an engraving by George Parker in The Magnolia of 1837. The Magnolia, which began in 1836, was probably the finest gift book in New York in the 1830s and was edited by Henry Wil- liam Herbert, who was smitten with one of Inman's The American Art Journal / May 1977 31</page><page sequence="7">Fi l i ': : &amp;i' '? ! : "*. : ::;.: =*:: ...- .. . : :: .:. : *.; : ::..: :.

Simms. Again, we cannot be sure if The Sister was based upon an original drawing created for the publication by Inman or whether it was adapted from an already extant oil painting. It is not to be confused with The Sisters (Fig. 8), an earlier illus- tration which appeared in The Atlantic Souvenir as the frontispiece in 1829, and engraved by Asher B. Durand. But this illustration exemplifies the con- fusion and fluidity that might exist among the genres of painting, for this seemingly "ideal" com- position is directly taken from the central two girls of the six-figure portrait of The Livingston Children (Fig. 1), with only a reduction in the number of children and a change in title from the specific to the general.16 We have spoken of the relationship of genre painting to literary illustration; similarly, there ex- ists another category of early nineteenth century pictorial art which is difficult to classify. Despite the derivation of The Sisters from an actual portrait, the vast majority who saw and most likely admired the engraving would have been unfamiliar with its source. The question arises, though, how they would classify the illustration. If it is not quite a portrait, it is also not quite a literary illustration, for often in the gift books the illustrations have only the most tenuous connection with prose or poetry published therein and, in fact, it was not un- usual for the literary text to be devised to elucidate the illustration. Yet, The Sisters is not quite a genre picture either, for it is not at all anecdotal. Like many of Inman's works, it is essentially expressive of childhood. More than any other term or catego- ry, it would function as a "fancy piece," a term originally used to refer to those late figure paint- ings of Sir Thomas Gainsborough, peasant sub- jects adapted in turn from the admired works of the seventeenth century Spaniard, Murillo.17 By the early nineteenth century, however, the term had lost any specific connotation of idealized low- er-class subject matter and was, in fact, more rele- vant to elegant figural compositions devoid of specific, narrative overtones. Here again, later writers referring to Inman's position as a pioneer- ing genre painter may have included his fancy pic- tures and illustrations in their consideration. There were a number of these that Inman produced, including several for the finest of all the New York annuals, The Talisman, the most signifi- cant joint production of Knickerbocker artists and 14.

The Durand engraving of The Sisters was reproduced again as El Amor Fraternal, which appeared in El Aguinaldo for 1830, the only Spanish language gift book published in the United States. Inman was extremely disappointed in the engraving of The Sisters. He wrote to Mathew Carey on January 18, 1829, that he wished "to have a place in your next year's Annual, in order to redeem some reputation, which I have lost by the un- fortunate engraving of the Sisters.

The Talisman was the first of the New York gift books and originated with Elam Bliss, a bookseller and publisher. The illustrations were provided by artists active in the young Na- tional Academy, including Samuel F.B. Morse, Robert Weir and Thomas Cole. Inman contributed two or three illustrations for each of the three years. The frontispiece for 1830 was his illustration of Childhood, an engraving of a single young girl that was later reused for The Religious Keepsake an- nual of 1835. Another illustration in the 1830 Tal- isman was Inman's Child and Lily, a typical nine- teenth century symbol of childhood innocence and purity, but also of the transience of youth. Inman's charge for such designs, when they were specifical- ly prepared for an annual and not drawn from a pre-existing painting, was one hundred dollars.19 Inman charged this price in Philadelphia for The Atlantic Souvenir, in New York for The Talisman, and in Boston for Samuel Griswold Goodrich's The Token, in the 1830 volume of which he provided an idyllic Couple Strolling in a Woods, Elizabethan in setting, and a more emotional medieval subject, The Doomed Bride, illustrating a love story by Gren- ville Mellon. The latter was exhibited in 1830 at The Boston Athenaeum as a cabinet picture, and thus must have been a (now unlocated) small oil painting, and not a drawing or a sketch. Other gift book illustrations by Inman include his Innocenza (Fig. 9), created for The Magnolia of 1836, and reissued in the Christian Family Annual in 1843-44 to accompany a poem on Innocence by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In this case, the il- 18. See James T. Callow, Kindred Spirits, 1967, pp. 25 ff. 19. Letter from Inman to Henry Carey, January 8, 1829, in the collection of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

And 1829 had seen Inman's design for the title page of The Western Souvenir engraved by his friend and colleague, Cephas Childs, and pub- lished in Cincinnati, Ohio. This last was neither a genre subject, nor a "fancy picture," but an allegorical representation of a young woman before a Western landscape. Such allegories-were not uncommon in Inman's early career, as he sought a wider reputation and undoubtedly needed to derive an income from whatever artistic outlets that he could find. As with many artists of the time, he created numerous de- signs for banknote embellishment, beginning as early as 1823, just about the start of his career. Many of these were engraved by Peter Maverick and other members of his family who had built up quite a business in banknote engraving. Among these were the three dollar New York City, Mer- chants Bank note; the five dollar Newport, Rhode Island, Merchants Bank note; and the five dollar Catskill, New York Bank note. On this last, Inman designed a hunter shooting a wildcat; vignettes of Franklin and other worthies were drawn by anoth- er hand. One might presume that these designs were most likely pen drawings by Inman, but this seems not necessarily to have been the case. In the Inman Memorial exhibition of 1846 one Charles Toppan exhibited bank note vignettes which may well have been oil paintings or sketches, and a pair of oil sketches, signed by Inman and dated 1833, exist which are very much in the nature of such bank- note embellishments although they do not seem to correspond to any known notes. One of these, (Fig. 10), depicts a young woman with a sickle, balanced by an Indian maiden, surrounding a rococo en- framement within which is a river landscape with activity suggesting farming and commerce. In a similar vein, Inman designed fire depart- ment certificates of admission and discharge as a commission awarded to him after unfavorable re- sults produced by a competition organized by the New York Fire Department with a premium of one thousand dollars. The Certificate of Admission, or appointment, depicted a nude, male, allegorical figure in the clouds being offered keys by a young woman; behind this was represented a city on fire. That of Discharge showed a woman with a horn and a male figure in contemporary costume, while a group of firemen greet a central figure with his hands on a certificate of discharge, along with his wife and son. These appear to have been designed in 1829.20 New'York Publi-hed by Monson Bancroft 339Broadw-y Fig. 9. Inman. INNOCENZA. Engraving by Thomas Kelly, from The Magnolia, 1836. Image size: 3 9/16 x 2 15/16". Actually, many of the most promising young artists of the period painted panels and other deco- rations for New York fire engines and hose car- riages; Inman was simply one of them. In addition, one of his certificate designs was also used on a banner for fire department parades.21 Now, some of this type of popular embellishment-banknotes, fire department certificates, banners and fire en- gine panels-were in the nature of genre, others were allegorical. But they early fixed Inman in the minds of the public with popular figural art that was non-portrait, and could not help but enhance his reputation as an extremely versatile artist. Inman's earliest surviving genre painting of significance is The Young Fisherman (Fig. 11), also called The Fisher Boy and The Sailor Boy. It is a small picture of a single, striding youth with a fishing pole over his shoulder, moving through a 20.

Ellis in The Atlantic Souvenir for 1830 and, presumably, the painting was done that year or the previous one. The short essay appended to the illustration, "The Fisher Boy," appears to have been inspired by the painting, rather than vice ver- sa, and Matthew Carey may have agreed to include Inman's picture in direct response to Inman's re- quest to "redeem his reputation" after his disap- pointment over the engraving of The Sisters of the previous year. For its use, Inman received only twenty-five dollars, suggesting that the picture was not painted solely for reproduction but was an in- dependent project, although also convenient for the purposes of the gift book. As such, however, it was known primarily through the engraving, which was admired, with reservations, by John Neal, one of the most perceptive critics of his day, who wrote in: The Yankee; and Boston Literary Ga- zette: . . it is a capital engraving, though wiry. The right foot is exceedingly well done, but the chest is that of a dwarf-such breadth and muscle, however, we should attribute to the painter-for engravers are pretty sure to copy such things faithfully.22 The figural proportions here are strange and not accurate, anatomically, but, as Alan Burroughs perceived, Inman displays here "nostalgia for the purity of childhood days."23 This, indeed, is the "message" of most of Inman's genre paintings. 22.

In Inman's paint- ing, a Byronic visage is grafted on to a healthy, chubby frame, and placed in a lush landscape so fertile that the child picks the fruit of an American Eden as he passes toward his goal of a fishing pond. The Young Fisherman was copied by Charles Loring Elliott24 who was to be Inman's successor as the first portraitist of New York City, but the theme became extremely popular among the genre painters of the mid-century, although In- man's rendition appears to have been one of the earliest.

Thomas Seirs Cummings exhibited a Young Angler at the American Art-Union in 1847 while Thomas Le Clear showed his Boys Fishing there the year be- fore. Closest to Inman's conception, however, and earlier than these others, was that by John Gadsby Chapman, exhibited at The National Academy in 1838; his Lazy Fisherman, another youthful theme, was painted in 1844. Inman and Chapman, both romantic artists, were concerned not so much with anecdote as with mood. One additional point might be emphasized and that is the biographical nature of the subject. Fishing was then as now a popular sport, but, among the artists, it was never as great a passion as it was to Inman, who was known among his, peers as an avid fisherman. He was a close friend of Henry William Herbert who, under the pseudo- nym of Frank Forester, may have been this coun- try's best-known sporting writer of the time, and both were members of a famous piscatorial club which met at Ward's hostelry.25 William T. Porter, the editor of the newspaper, The Spirit of the Times was a close friend of Inman's and the subject of several depictions, as well as a fellow angler. Porter wrote about Inman: In trout fishing, especially, he excelled, as in the case of Professor Wilson, and other kindred spirits, this was emphatically his hobby. And a more accom- plished disciple, good old Izaac Walton never had. In throwing a fly or spinning a minnow, he had few equals. He was ready to say with Hood that 'of all the sports ever sported, commend me to angling!' it be- ing, in the opinion of both, the wisest, virtuousest, dis- creetest, best; the safest, cheapest, and, in all likeli- hood, the oldest of pastimes. It is a one-handed game that would have Adam himself; it is the only one which Noah could have amused himself on the Ark. Hunting and shooting came in second and third. The common phrase, 'fish, flesh and fowl,' hint clearly at the order of precedence! Such was the ardent belief on our departed friend; he not only agreed that 'an- gling comes by nature,' but it was 'in his system' as the doctors say. His experience, like our own, was, that he certainly became acquainted with the angling rod next after the birchen one!2 When Inman went abroad in 1844, The Spirit of the Times bemoaned that: ... we hate to hear of his going abroad at all! Who shall now put us up to the trick of hornswoggling a salmon trout of fourty pounds? Who will teach us the 24.

Thank heaven Inman is not to leave you, my fine fellows, without having one more 'taste of your quality.' in consideration of which, and as it is our particular request, we trust you will give him the plea- sure of your company at dinner!27 In Great Britain, Inman visited Sir William Drummond Stuart at Drummond Castle in Scot- land and the newspaper spoke of his catching a magnificent salmon, but Inman himself chided Porter for writing such misleading, and inaccurate hyperbole.28 Inman's preference for piscatorial pursuits found later pictorial reference in his Landscape, or, Trout Fishing in Sullivan County, of c. 1841, lost today but known from an engraving, which was one of the artist's most admired land- scapes. The Young Fisherman was not only an early genre painting in Inman's oeuvre but it was an ear- ly example of this artistic theme in American art; it was also one to which Inman was not to return for over ten years. His oeuvre of the 1830s was almost totally taken up by portraiture, although in 1832-34, while living in Mount Holly, New Jersey, and working with Cephas Childs in Philadelphia, he became involved with the new art of lithogra- phy. In 1834, Inman painted The Bride of Lammer- moor (Fig. 12), his most ambitious figure picture of all, which must certainly have strengthened both his confidence and interest in imaginative figural pieces and also increased his reputation for such painting. But derived as it is from the work of Sir Walter Scott, and being a subject already known in such a presentation as a book illustration by Charles Leslie,29 Inman's Bride appears more an example of a grand manner literary form than that 27. Spirit of the Times, Saturday, April 6, 1844, p. 61. The arti- cle mentioned a number of Inman's favorite fishing haunts, in- cluding Kalikoon, Beaver Kill, Lake Pleasant, and Long Island. According to The American Whig Review, August, 1851, p. 126, Stony Brook was one of Inman's favorite fishing spots on Long Island. Thomas Picton, "Old Time Disciples of Rod and Gun," The Rod and Gun, February 12, 1876, p. 313, has a long article about the piscatorial activities of the day, the leading figure of the group being Richard T. Fosdick, who gathered about him Inman, Porter and the others. Fosdick's diary is quoted in the article, listing numerous fishing haunts on Long Island and in Westchester County, and detailing fishing excursions with In- marl between 1840 and 1843. In June of 1841, a six-day fishing trip to Sullivan County netted 548; the largest weighed three pounds, three ounces, and Inman was so delighted that he sketched the trout on the woodwork of the porch of Chester Darbie's home where the fishermen were encamped.

It should be mentioned in passing, how- ever, that Inman's picture is a relatively early pic- torialization of Scott's famous novel of 1819, and precedes by a year the great opera of Gaetano Do- nizetti.30 Inman's next major genre picture was not created until 1841. The Newsboy, (Fig. 13) like The Young Fisherman and the later genre pictures by Inman, is concerned with youth, but in this case, in a very different guise. Again, Inman presents us with a single, youthful figure, but not as an idyllic presence. The Newsboy is as close as Inman comes to social realism and social comment, for this youth is no longer oblivious to the problems and trials of contemporary life but engulfed by them. He stands ragged and somewhat forlorn, in hand-me- down clothes too large for him, already perhaps somewhat corrupted by the hardships of life, as suggested by his slightly unkempt condition, his cynical gaze, slouched hat, and casual pose. His sustenance is a partially eaten apple-and one notes its diminutive size-while his ragged condi- tion is contrasted with the elegant sphinx in bronze atop the balustrade against which he leans, and the distant mansion, solid and substantial, and obvi- ously warm from the fire whose smoke billows from a chimney. This work, too, was reproduced in an annual, 30.

Strong, was seen in the original at the National Academy in 1841, al- though it was soon in the possession of the great New York collector, Jonathan Sturges, who lent it to the Inman Memorial Exhibition in 1846. Both the painting and the engraving were much praised, The New-York Mirror calling it "true to na- ture" and the magazine, Arcturus going on at great length, that: Every New Yorker must appreciate the clear percep- tion of character and masterly execution of the pic- ture. We hope it might be the first of a Popular Por- trait Gallery, for which the evervarying aspect of our crowded thoroughfares would supply an inexhaust- ible fund of subjects.31 Later, The Knickerbocker more fully detailed the circumstances pertaining to the creation of the picture: His [Inman's] attention was one day arrested by one of a crowd of news-boys collected around the Astor- House steps. The little fellow was ragged and dirty enough, but it would do all the better for a picture, and beside that, the matted hair hanging over the brows, and the old torn hat, made the ruddy face be- neath look all the handsomer. A bargain was 'struck' immediately and the little news-boy was to go in two ?~,$II zN sll?- ol;?~-l. _ . s.-* . Fig. 15. Thomas Le Clear. BUFFALO NEWSBOY. 1853. Oil on canvas, 24 x 30.

In due time, he presented himself, but every vestige of his trade had vanished. His long-buried face had been ex- humed, his hair cropped a la militaire, his torn clothes neatly mended and brushed, even the old straw hat had been changed. From the top of his cloth cap to the tips of his new shoes, he was a failure. The artist sent him home to get dirty again, and it was not long before matters became artistic with the youth, I as- sure you. I need not tell you his name, but his face has been rendered immortal in Inman's picture of 'The Newsboy!.32 We may think of him, perhaps, as "Billy Snub The Newsboy," the title of the gift book tale written by the popular author of sentimental tales, Seba Smith which the engraving by Richard W. Dodson enhanced. Such a story is by no means unique, and is certainly in part apocryphal, since no sphinxes seem ever to have adorned the steps of the famous Astor House, but the luxury and splendor of that hostelry is certainly meant to be evoked in contrast to the poverty of the newsboy, and a number of street figures found pictorialization in the nine- teenth century with appellations such as "The 31.

Gerdts / Inman 40</page><page sequence="16">Match Girl of the Astor House," and "The Boot- black of the Astor House." Inman's painting attracted numerous admir- ers, perhaps none more prestigious than Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote from Philadelphia in 1843: "I saw too the originals of some very pretty pictures which, I was told, are engraved in 'The Gift' for 1843."33 Among these was The Newsboy, perhaps returned to Edward Carey for engraving, as no edition of The Gift was offered in 1841. The picture seems to have been the first of a whole se- ries of depictions of the theme of the newsboy, popular throughout the century, combining the subject of the youthful worker with that of the news and the newspaper, an extremely significant theme, allied not only with the growing impor- tance of the newspaper in the dissemination of knowledge and information but with an alliance of this with the "newness" of America, of a nation with more future than past. But Inman's newsboy is quite different even from those which succeeded it in the next decade or so-Frederick Spencer's self-confident young Newsboy of 1849 (Fig. 14), enframed by an architec- tural proscenium of pilasters, and silhouetted against a backdrop of colorful posters, or Thomas Le Clear's Buffalo Newsboy of 1853 (Fig. 15), cheer- ful and self-assured, one who exudes Emersonian self-reliance, or who could grow up to be Presi- dent! Inman's newsboy seems a Dickensian charac- ter, pathetic and sickly, a kind of New York Oliver Twist. This may not be a coincidental reference, for Inman was one of forty signers of a letter to Dickens in January of 1842, congratulating the novelist on his arrival in this country and inviting him to a banquet; the first signer was Inman's old friend, Washington Irving.34 On Monday, the 14th of February, there was held the first of the great New York social events related to Charles Dickens, the famous 'Boz Ball' attended by thousands and including a series of tableaux vivants, one of which presented Oliver Twist. Inman was said to be the only artist present.35 Ten days later, there was a dinner at The Astor House at which Inman was a principal speaker; he concluded his talk with a toast: I will give you, sir, The 'Boz' Gallery of Written Pic- tures-May Charles Dickens long live to add new characterizations to the imperishable collection.36 Was not Inman's Newsboy already a visual tribute in an equivalent pictorial gallery? Inman also painted his Lady with a Mask by 1841 (Fig. 16) for it was exhibited that year by Ed- ward Carey in the Artists' Fund Society in Phila- Fig. 16. Inman. LADY WITH A MASK. C. 1841.

Carey. delphia; three years later it was shown at The Na- tional Academy in New York and was seen again in 1846 in the Inman Memorial Exhibition, entitled The Mask. Carey does not appear to have used it for a gift book illustration, however, until 1846, when it appeared in The Diadem, engraved by John Sartain. Another "fancy picture" by Inman, The Page, was engraved by Sartain for the frontispiece of this gift book; the original is unlocated today. The Lady with a Mask is much larger than Inman's usual genre subjects, a somewhat idealized, "In- gres-like" figure, more buxom than the contempo- rary, lithe, "Keepsake Girls" of English periodicals. She represents a formulated type to which even some of Inman's contemporaneous portraits con- form, such as his well-known Georgiana Buckham and her Mother of 1840 (Worcester Art Museum). The face is a perfect oval, the eyes large and al- mond-shaped, the lips full and cherry-colored, the arms, thick and boneless. She is covered with a 33.

The mask she holds suggests a hint of mystery. Contemporary criticism was mixed, The Knickerbocker admiring its charm of light and shadow and its remarkable foreshortening, while still not quite liking it as a picture, when it was on view in New York in 1844.37 1842 saw the creation of what instantly be- came Inman's most admired genre picture and is still the best known today, his Mumble the Peg (Fig. 17), painted for Edward Carey and published in The Gift for 1844, engraved by Joseph Ives Pease. It was used to illustrate the Story of Nick TenVlyck by George Fenno Hoffman, or rather, the painting may have inspired the picture, for Hoffman wrote in the introduction to his story that Inman re- sponded to his recognition of the subject of his tale, in the picture upon the artist's easel: Pardon my interruption-but what the deuce are you running on about with your roads and rivers, cos- tumes and countries? Why the whole thing is a hasty composition-a sort of pictorial memorandum of ear- ly school-day amusements; and I don't know that I even had the Hudson in my mind till I came to jot in that sloop, to relieve the color of the water.38 The painting was greeted with much en- thusiasm and admired for its presentation of idyllic and innocent childhood. The Knickerbocker praised it as follows: Mr. Inman has a most sweet picture in No. 227, 'Mumble the Peg,' It is very carefully and neatly finished, and we think is one of the best he has lately painted. It is good in all things: in effect, in color, and in drawing. The boys evince great ernestness in their play, and we feel inclined to fling ourselves down be- side them, to participate in their sport and enjoy the beautiful landscape which surrounds them.39 While Brother Jonathan's critic said: Of all the interesting pictures of this artist, which are numerous, we think this one of the most beautiful. The composition is tasteful, the drawing and coloring exceedingly good. What a commanding and genius- like air about the boy of the sunny hair, and the left foot and leg of his are wonderfully true to nature. Would that Inman would paint more of such pic- tures. They are just the kind to be engraved for annu- als. We hope this one may be soon.40 In the autumn of 1842, Joseph Sill recorded in his diary that he saw the picture in the home of Ed- ward Carey, and wrote that it was "well drawn and sweetly painted.-the boys are very good, and the landscape distance is better than anything I have every seen of Inman's."41 The fullest admiration for the work is to be found in the writing of Henry T. Tuckerman, a great champion of Inman's work in general, and his genre pictures in particular. Tuckerman wrote: There was a charming example of his pleasant inven- tion at one of the Academy exhibitions. It represents two boys playing mumble-peg, or stick knife, on a green back in summer. Such exuberant juvenility as their faces and attitude displayed! It was a most hap- py touch of nature, the work of three afternoons- such a one as stirs a pulse in every heart. It brings back the days of boyhood, like magic-the 'unchart- ered freedom' of that bright age, and its buoyant air of careless enjoyment. The freshness of their looks, like the verdure on which they are stretched, is as the smile of the blest spring that preceded the manhood 'of our discontent'-gleaming through the long vista of years. Benign old gentlemen used to stop before the little gem, and smile, and then grow thoughtful.42 Tuckerman very perceptively understood the spirit and the appeal of Inman's little masterwork, it's romantic charm which was also evinced in the 1842 National Academy catalogue where, append- ed to the listing was an excerpt from Byron: And dear the school boy spot, We ne'er forget, tho' there we are forgot. Paintings such as Mumble the Peg, with their care- free world mirrored in an idyllic landscape, con- trast increasingly with the difficulties of Inman's own existence. A tremendously successful artist al- most upon emerging professionally on his own, he suffered greatly in the economic crisis of 1837, an economic blow from which he never recovered. He remained until his death a much respected figure among his peers and an important New York por- traitist, but newer, younger painters were begin- ning to emerge in the 1840s, and Inman's increas- ingly bad health was a constant trial which ham- pered his professional activity. But none of this is at all suggested in his picture here, except in con- trast. The particular subject of boys playing the game of mumble the peg found later imitation in the works of such diverse artists as James L. Wood and James Brade Sword, but more immediately and better known is the conspicuous group of boys 37. The Knickerbocker, June, 1844, p. 598. 38.

There are several other paintings by Inman which are unlocated today, but their titles suggest a kinship to Mumble the Peg. These include a Boys at Play, listed by Tuckerman as in the estate of Robert Gilmore, and The Young Rustic which Julia Sand lent to the Inman Memorial Exhibition. The dates of these works are not known, but Inman's next "genre" picture was his now unlocated Boyhood of Washington, known today from the engraving of William Humphrys entitled Early Days of Washing- ton (Fig. 18), published in Carey &amp; Hart's Literary Souvenir of 1845. It was also referred to variously as The Peacemaker and The Youthful Peace Maker, il- lustrating a story of Washington as "The Peace- maker," in the gift book. This was again a "cabinet" painting43-that is, not a miniature but not as large as life-size-with three principal figures, and two subsidiary ones. A youthful, elegantly dressed young man is determinedly separating two other youths, one somewhat rustic, the other richly groomed, while two other boys look on at the left, all set in a rural landscape. The wealthier of the combatants holds an object in his hand, while the rustic, the more forceful and glowering of the two, reaches toward him. Inman's painting is, then, an early example of "genreized history," purporting to tell a story of everyday life in the life of a famous historical figure, in this case America's great leader who was, by the 1840s, almost deified. The mid-century was soon to witness a whole rash of such subjects by art- ists such as Junius Brutus Stearns, Daniel Hunting- ton and many, many others. But one should note, too, the specific form Inman's allegory has taken. Washington, even as a boy, is presented firmly in command, and in the role of both peacemaker and judge, one above class or wealth distinction. Fur- thermore, Inman has knowingly presented the young Washington centrally positioned with arms outstretched, a very Christ-like pose and easily rec- ognized by contemporaries familiar with the fa- mous painting or engraving by Ary Scheffer of Christ Consolator of 1837 of a similar theme. The religious reference is underscored, at least in Humphrys' engraving, by the rays of heavenly light which beam down from the left upon the head of the young Washington. The picture was exhibited by Inman's friend, the lithographer Cephas G. Childs, at The Penn- sylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1843 as Wash- Fig. 18. Inman. EARLY DAYS OF WASHINGTON.

Tuckerman praised the work extravagantly, while the critic of The New Mirror admired the combina- tion of Inman's typical charm with the patriotic ap- peal of the subject.44 A writer in Littell's Living Age coupled it with Mumble the Peg as: among the most delightful specimens of composition 43. The term, a cabinet picture is a somewhat confusing one, in its 19th century usage. A cabinet portrait was a likeness larger than a miniature but smaller than a life-size depiction-that is, a portrait, bust to full-length, upwards of about 8 inches high that could, properly, be housed in or upon a cabinet. Inman's broth- er-in-law, George Twibill, was a leading cabinet portrait special- ist ca. 1830; later, George Linen or Linnen was America's fore- most cabinet portraitist. However, the term appears to have been used not only for other pictures of similar size, but occa- sionally for any painting with figures less than life-size, particu- larly if such a picture was a reduction of a larger one. Thus, Robert Weir's famous Embarkation of the Pilgrims, in the Rotun- da of the Capitol, was also known in a "cabinet" replica of 1857, which, though smaller than the original, was still quite substan- tial-4 x 6 feet in size. 44.

The lovers of Leslie and Wilkie will find great satisfaction in these cabinet gems, and recognize, at the same time, the individual- ity of Inman's genius.45 These same words appeared also in the Commercial Advertiser and in the Courier and Enquirer. The sub- ject of the young Washington had already been painted and exhibited by John Gadsby Chapman whose Washington as Surveyor of 1841 is known to- day, and may be the picture exhibited at the Amer- ican Art-Union in that year as Washington in his Youth. Chapman's painting is a generalized presen- tation of a young man of the mid-eighteenth cen- tury; Inman grafts on to his much more youthful figure the pacific but assertive qualities which his generation wished to identify with Washington. It, in turn, appears to have inspired the much cruder but much more complex, multi-figured painting by the little-known Thomas W. Hope, Washington the Boy Hero and Peace Maker (Fig. 19). Inman's genre paintings of the 1840s, al- though relatively few, exhibit a careful growth and development. The Newsboy of 1841 is a single figure; the following year, Inman developed a double-figured composition and a more expansive setting in Mumble-the-Peg. It is believed that the Boyhood of Washington was developed in 1842-43, and contained five figures, and perhaps an even more developed setting. 1844 does not seem to have produced any genre, certainly due in part to the extensive preparations he made for his trip to England with his daughter Mary. Inman left on June 17th, with plans for travel, portrait commis- sions, and visits to English relatives. He stayed in Great Britain almost a year, returning in April of 1845. Inman's trip abroad had been made, partly, in a quest for renewed health, but this was not to be, and within a year he died. Only a relatively few paintings are known from these last months. One, signed and dated 1845, is his Boy on a Hobby Horse, once owned by Prosper M. Wetmore, and in all likelihood an informal Wetmore family portrait, as Inman had painted numerous members of that family. It was probably similar to Henry Sargent's earlier Boy on a Hobby Horse, (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) which in that case, was of a member of that artist's own family. Among Inman's final paintings, indeed his last completed picture, was his Dismissal from School on an October Afternoon (Fig. 20) which he finished on November 8, 1845. This was Inman's largest and most elaborate genre painting, a combination of landscape, genre and literary reference, as the thin 45. Littell's Living Age, April, 1846, p. 19.

Tuckerman referred to it as "a sweet, pensive, mellow landscape,"46 and Inman, himself, felt it a "rather unusual" picture in a letter to Ma- jor Abraham Cozzens, inviting the latter to see it before the artist delivered it to his patron, James Lennox.47 The catalogue of the Inman Memorial exhibition mentioned that "This admirable picture is the last that Mr. Inman ever finished. When he had finished it, he remarked that he had painted his last picture." The New York Evening Gazette reported on November 24, 1845, about the picture: The subject of the Painting is'An American District Schoolhouse' on the skirt of a wood, with children just released from their tasks, loitering to frolic on the hillside, ere they turn their steps homeward .... The surrounding scenery, characteristic of the valley of the Hudson generally, wears upon its features a more especially family resemblance to the landscape of Chester County: and indeed the name of Ichabod Crane, over the schoolhouse door, would seem to inti- mate that the withered ruler of copybooks who is just closing it, must have wielded the birchen sceptre of his authority not far from Sleepy Hollow. From the negro who paused to grin at the sport of the children, as, axe on shoulder, he plods his up-hill way home- ward, to the dash of foam upon the stream that hints at the mill in the hazy distance, from the rich forest glade, chequered by the level sunbeams, to the deli- cious autumnal atmosphere that softens the distant spire beneath the mountains-the whole picture, alike in composition and handling, is full of beauty and character:-a thorough American 'October After- noon.' Tuckerman, however, recognized Inman's essenti- al differences from prevailing'style of American landscape painting, the growing meticulousness of the Hudson River School, when he termed the pic- ture: Very pleasing and effective. The foliage is not depict- ed as minutely as some painters like, but at a short dis- tance the impression is more like nature. The water is admirable; it glints in the light, or gurgles over shal- lows delightfully. The atmosphere, too, abounds with feeling.48 The painting was subsequently featured in the Inman memorial exhibition which opened on Feb- ruary 10, 1846 at the rooms of the American Art- Union as a benefit for his widow and children. Much admired, the picture was in turn singled out in The American Whig Review in discussing this "Tribute to Inman": One picture in the collection possessed particular in- terest. It was the October Afternoon, the artist's last pic- ture and best landscape. It represents a scene in 'the mellow autumn time,' upon the edge of a wood, and near the bank of a stream. The foreground is occu- pied by a group of children just broke loose from the village school, which is seen, with the low roof half shaded by sparse foliage of a gnarled apple tree, near the entrance of the narrow forest road. The composi- tion of the picture is easy, natural and pleasing to a degree which would indicate that the artist had made landscape the study of his life, and its tone beautifully subdued though the color is warm. Rarely do we see a landscape so winning as this; the shadows of those beautiful trees, under which you can peer till the eye is lost in their winding intervals, are so cool, and the splashing streamlet and warm autumnal haze which fills the atmosphere so dream-inducing, that it seems as if a walk up that verdant alley which comes to the forest edge would certainly end at the foot of one of those mossy trunks in a reverie, lulled by the mur mir of the brook and the distant, broken hum of young voices, till it melted into sleep, full of visions as soft and tranquil as the undulating landscape which stretches dimly into distance. The figures of the pic- ture are admirably grouped, and the faces finished like miniatures.49 This was, indeed, Inman's autumnal work, a blissfully idyllic contrast to his own, wracked condi- tion, a nostalgic, backward glance over his short life, a sadly sweet image of never-forgotten child- hood.50 We have seen, then, that Inman produced a series of enthusiastically received genre pictures, few in number and nearly all dating from the last years of his life. He turned to this theme for a number of reasons. Partly, certainly to continue and even expand his repertory at a time when the rage for portraiture, his acknowledged forte, was diminishing, and when the appearance of the Art- Unions was eloquent testimony to the public de- mand for new themes. His successful attempts at genre also bear recognition to the development of 46. Tuckerman, op. cit., p. 237. 47.

It is worth speculating about the relationship of this paint- ing by Inman with The Village School, variant title, The Village School Dismissed, by Henry John Boddington. Boddington was a once well-known English landscape and genre artist, whose pic- tures were extensively exhibited in this country, and he was pa- tronized by collectors such as Edward Carey who were also friends and patrons of Inman's. Inman could easily have seen this painting when it was exhibited at the National Academy, in 1844 just before he went to England; and he might well have seen other examples of Boddington's art once in Great Britain. Boddington's painting soon found a purchaser in this country for in that same year, 1844, it was shown in Philadelphia at the Artist's Fund Society, then owned by James Furness.

Karolik Collection. this theme in the hands of such diverse artists as Francis Edmonds, George Comegys, and above all, William Sidney Mount, during the previous dec- ade.51 As such, however, Inman was certainly not the innovator in American genre, much less its first successful practitioner. Why then, did he achieve this reputation? Undoubtedly it was due, in part, to the enormous success that his few genre pictures did achieve, both in the original and in popular en- gravings of these works, engravings which as we have seen even cast some of his portraits into the realm of genre. In part, however, it may have been because, to a later generation, his paintings did ap- pear to differ from the mass of mid-century genre paintings. Artists such as Mount and Edmonds, and later Bingham and Blythe, heeded the call of critics to paint American subjects stressing distinct- ly national characteristics. As early as 1822, critics called for representations of the character of the baronial Virginian, the Eastern merchant, the Connecticut peddler, the Mississippi boatmen, the 51. The growing appreciation of genre is especially well mir- rored in the criticism of Mount's work. Critics of his art in the early 1830's admired his ability at figure painting but criticized his pictures because: "there is too much common honesty in the figures. They are mere country people; whereas, he ought to mingle a grace with them." A decade and more later, his paint- ing was admired for exactly those qualities earlier criticized: "his small pictures of American common life, are among the finest things that we have ever reproduced in art .. ." Other critics spoke about his "strictly natural character . . . more val- uable and interesting than heroic phases of art."

By the 1850s, the call would appear to have been heeded but, in retrospect, Inman's genre pictures seemed to suggest an earlier vintage and seemed to relate to a more romantic, idyllic world than the re- alistic Long Island farm scenes of Mount or the flatboatmen of Bingham. They appeared more in an European and perhaps specifically English tra- dition, just as their more painterly technique sug- gested English romanticism rather than mid-cen- tury American realism, and indeed, many aspects of Inman's art and his life were consciously mod- eled and dependent upon English antecedents, for all his position in Knickerbocker artistic society. In- man's genre paintings, even in their most storytell- ing posture, still seemed to emphasize a mood rather than a narrative, quite at odds with the pre- vailing tone of mid-century genre, and in that quality they bear a slight kinship to the late figure paintings of Washington Allston, also a romantic artist of European aesthetic heritage. The paintings of Mount, Bingham and other mid-century genre specialists reached a wide, ap- preciative audience through their reproduction in the art of lithography and in the engravings of the art-unions. Inman's genre paintings, in contrast, were widely known through gift-book illustration. The gift books continued well into the middle of the century, albeit in declining popularity, but as a form of popular culture naturally regarded as pre- dating the era of the art-unions. Again, an artist identified with such books would be related by lat- er historians to a period prior to the era of Mount and Bingham. But if Inman little deserved the ap- pellation of "the first American genre painter," he was an artist who produced an image of childhood that remained a romantic ideal for many decades, and, as a nostalgic vision of a better, more blissful past, is with us still.
