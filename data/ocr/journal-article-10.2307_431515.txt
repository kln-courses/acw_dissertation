<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID L. MOSLEY Auflhsung in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Music The concept Auflosung offers an especially rich topic for interdisciplinary investigation into nine- teenth-century aesthetic theory and practice. The word Auflhsung may refer to: dissolution, disen- tanglement, denouement (in a theatrical sense), analysis (in a chemical and mathematical sense), and disbandment (in a military sense). In music the resolution from an unpleasant or unstable pitch configuration to one that is pleasant or stable is an Auflhsung. Furthermore, Auflhsung was an important concept for nineteenth-cen- tury aesthetics, in which the dissolution and resolution of the boundaries between the various modes of aesthetic expression are examined the- oretically. This essay will examine Auflhsung in three different nineteenth-century contexts: as a poetic term and musical procedure, as an actual musico-poetic expression, and as an aesthetic prin- ciple. This examination will show that Auflksung is an icon, index, and symbol of the synaesthetic orientation of nineteenth-century aesthetic the- ory and practice. I. AUFLOSUNG AS POETIC TERM AND MUSICAL PROCEDURE In the many poetic uses of Auflhsung, such as those by Arnim, Goethe, Jean-Paul, Schiller, and Wieland documented in the Deutsches Wbrter- buch of the Grimm brothers, the term often stands for the pivotal point in the dissolution of one state of affairs into another, i.e., it describes a transcendent moment. As a nineteenth-century musical device Auflhsung typically involved the resolution of a dissonance into a consonance. The dissonance played an ever-expanding role in nineteenth-century music, and, as a conse- quence, its resolution gained an added signifi- cance. The ubiquitous suspensions and appog- giaturas in the melodic writing of this era testify to the importance of the dissonance and its reso- lution on the local and global levels of a musical composition. Thus Auflksung as a poetic term refers to the dissolution of tension involved in a transcendent moment, and as a musical pro- cedure Aufl5sung represents the resolution of tension heard in the movement from dissonance to consonance.1 II. AUFLOSUNG AS A MUSICO-POETIC EXPRESSION Aside from its use as a poetic term and musical procedure there is an interesting example of the use of Aufl5sung as a musico-poetic expression during the early nineteenth century which has re- ceived little attention. In Franz Schubert's setting of Johann Mayrhofer's poem titled "Auflosung" the poetic and musical understandings of Aufl5- sung are conflated. Auflbsung Verbirg dich, Sonne, Denn die Gluten der Wonne Versengen mein Gebein; Verstummt, ihr Tone, Fruhlingsschdne, fluichte dich Und lass mich allein! Quillen doch aus allen Falten Meiner Seele liebliche Gewalten, Die mich umschlingen, Himmlisch singen. Geh unter, Welt, Und store nimmer und nimmer Die suissen, atherischen Chore.

There flow from every recess of my soul loving powers which embrace me, celestially singing. Founder, world, and disturb never more the sweet ethereal choirs.2 Mayrhofer's "Aufl6sung" involves a series of imperative statements in which the narrator es- chews the beauties of the sun, of sound, and of spring in favor of the loving powers which flow from the recesses of the individual soul. The conclusion of the poem is a heroic denial of life itself for sweet and otherworldly songs. One critic has rightly claimed that the poem "con- stitutes a poetic rhapsody on the theme of death."3 Yet such an observation must be integrated with the poem's title. The death about which the poem rhapsodizes is a release from the realities of the external world and a solution to the tensions they generate. Thus the poem examines the transcen- dent moment in which the soul is transported from the phenomenal to the noumenal realm. The most striking images of the contrast between these two realms are the "Tone," or physical sounds, of the first stanza and the "Ch6re," or musical sounds, of the second stanza. The pair- ing of these images in the context of Auflosung suggests the transformation of acoustic phenom- ena into spiritual noumena-of mere sounds into heavenly music. The opening bars of Schubert's musical real- ization of Mayrhofer's poem, D. 807 of 1824, suggest that he will make a rather straightfor- ward application of the musical notion of Aufl h- sung in his setting of the text: measures 1-6 involve the harmonic progression from the tonic to a fully diminished seventh-chord and back to the tonic. However, at the entrance of the text Schubert's harmonic language becomes much less conventional. Specifically, there are two remarkable musical transitions corresponding to pivotal transcendent moments in the text A I r ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~K 17 B to d at. . ad GM "Und lass mich allein!" FIGURE 1. which defy explanation by means of traditional musical analysis. The first of these sets the lines of the poem in which the narrator em- phatically states his or her desire for solitude (line 6). In this passage, measures 18-20, the musical setting modulates in such a way that the key of G major seems to dissolve into the key of Ab major. This dissolution is graphi- cally displayed in Figure 1 and involves the motion from D-Eb and G-Ab in the outer voices, while the inner voices move from B-C and G-F-Eb. The second harmonic dissolution occurs in measures 33-39 and sets the portion of the text in which the narrator describes the celestial mu- sic that embraces him or her once the phenom- enal world is left behind (lines 9-10). This pas- sage, which modulates from Ab major back to G major, is graphically displayed in Figure 2 and involves the motion from Ab-B and Ab-G in the outer voices, while the inner voices move from Eb-D and C-B. It is important to observe that Figures 1 and 2 show how each harmonic dissolution involves almost exclusively step-wise motion. In pas- sages like those discussed above, the composer is able to use music to a hermeneutic end. By setting those portions of the poem which exam- ine the transition from the phenomenal to the noumenal realms with music in which stable tonal regions smoothly dissolve from one to</page><page sequence="6">442 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 33 34 ?&amp;? ?&amp;? ALW GM "Die mich umschlingen, Himmlisch singen." FIGURE 2. another and back again, Schubert explains the element of transcendence present in the poetic discourse by means of musical discourse. Schu- bert's interest in setting "Aufldsung" to music may also have been stimulated by the manner in which Mayrhofer's poem can be read as a sym- bolic account of the process by which any poetic text is realized musically. As has often been observed, linguistic and musical expressions share the common characteristic of being com- prised of sounds in time; however, language and music as sign systems exhibit some important incompatibilities. Chief among these is the fact that, in most cases, linguistic expressions may be interpreted as referring to external realities while, generally speaking, musical expressions may be interpreted only in relation to them- selves. Thus Mayrhofer's poem, in which the external beauties of the world are denied in favor of the self-contained bliss of heaven, displays the same kind of progression involved in any musical realization of a text. While the genre of song must be viewed as a hybrid expression, this does not mean the poem and its musical setting are equal partners in the aesthetic endeavor; rather, the genre of song demonstrates the he- gemony of music over the text.4 Music, more often than not, has its way with the poem, i.e., the non-referential and self-reflexive properties of the musical setting supersede the referential content of the poem and the song is experienced as a "musical" expression. III. AUFLOSUNG AS AN AESTHETIC PRINCIPLE The process described in Mayrhofer's poem, in which the the external realities of the world are denied in favor of the internal realities of spir- itual solitude, represents the resolution of ten- sion permitted by the dissolution of one state of affairs into another. Likewise, the process by which any poem is realized musically, and in which its referential content is assimilated by the non-referential and self-reflexive properties of music, embodies the dissolution of one aesthetic mode of expression into another. The dissolu- tion of the boundaries between the various modes of aesthetic expression and the resolution of one aesthetic mode into another constitutes one of the central principles of nineteenth-century aes- thetic theory. This theoretical understanding of Auflbsung occupies an especially important posi- tion in the aesthetics of G.W.F. Hegel. Hegel's chief concern in his Aesthetics (1835) has to do with the varying relationships between content and form in the various modes of aesthetic ex-</page><page sequence="7">Mosley Auflasung in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Music 443 pression. He grouped the various modes of aes- thetic expression into three categories: the sym- bolic, the classical, and the romantic. Hegel identified architecture as the typical symbolic expression in which "the spiritual idea has not yet found its adequate form, but is engaged in striving and struggling after it."5 In regard to this struggle between the spiritual idea and its adequate form, Hegel continued, "The incon- gruity of the two elements to each other makes the relation of spiritual idea to objective reality a negative one" (p. 322). In regard to classical expressions, which for Hegel were typified by sculpture, he claimed, "In it [sculpture] we find the free and adequate embodiment of the spir- itual idea in the form most suitable to it and with it meaning and expression are in perfect accord" (p. 323). However, sculpture was limited in Hegel's view by the fact that it is anthropomor- phic. He continued, "The result [of sculpture and its attendant anthropomorphism] is that spirit is characterized as a particular form of mind, namely, human mind, and not as simply absolute and eternal" (p. 324). This observation led Hegel to call for the dissolution of classical art, a call he claimed was realized in the roman- tic expressions of painting, music, and poetry. Hegel asserted, "This latter point [about sculp- ture and its anthropomorphism] brings to light the defect of classical art, which demands its dissolution [auflbst] " (p. 324). Romantic art, Hegel claimed, "dissolves [aufgelbst] the insep- arable unity which is the ideal of the classical form of art and its mode of expression-the inner world [the stress is Hegel's] is the content of romantic art, and as such thus triumphs over the outer world-indeed, so triumphs that the outer world itself is made to proclaim its victory, through which the sensuous appearance sinks into worthlessness" (pp. 325-327). Thus, for Hegel, romantic aesthetic expressions exhibit a hegemony of spiritual content which supersedes their material forms of representation. Indeed, the power of the spiritual content is so great as to reduce the material form of romantic art to in- significance. Music is the focal point of Hegel's discussion of romantic art because it demon- strates this hegemony of content over form. Hegel believed music's content is most closely related to the inner world of the emotions while its form exhibits the weakest connections to the outer world. He stated: The special characteristic relating the abstract inner consciousness most closely to music is emotion [again the stress is Hegel's], the self-extending subjectivity of the ego. Emotion does in fact gravitate toward some content, but it still leaves this content confined within the ego unconnected with anything external and is thereby formally connected with it. In this way, emotion always remains only the outward covering of the content. It is in this field which music operates.... For the moment I shall simply repeat the observation that musical notes in themselves may differ enor- mously in type and quality, and may divide into or combine in the most varied kinds of compatible, essentially contrasting, related or unrelated patterns. These contrasts and combinations, and the different ways in which they move and change, the way they are presented, progress, and conflict, resolve and dis- solve into nothing, reflect to a greater or lesser degree the inner nature both of a particular content and of the emotions absorbed. Hence tonal relationships of a specific kind are now understood and given shape, expressing in a conventionalized code what is latent in the depths of the spirit as specific content.6 These statements clarify our often vague under- standing of the synaesthetic orientation of nine- teenth-century century aesthetics and the leading role music played in this impulse. The romantic concentration on the inner world of emotion and the discounting of the outer world of appear- ance-a concentration which is the subject of Mayrhofer's "Aufl6sung" and the point of de- parture for Schubert's setting of it-is most closely mirrored in the non-referential and self- reflexive properties of music. Thus Auflosung as a poetic term and musical procedure, as a musico-poetic expression, and as an aesthetic principle is a truly polysemiotic constellation in the nineteenth century. The quality of Auflisung as a poetic term refers to the dissolution of one state of affairs into another state of affairs, while the quality of of Auflcsung as a musical pro- cedure embodies the resolution of an unstable pitch-configuration into one which is stable. The actual musico-poetic expression of Auflksung in Schubert's setting of Mayrhofer's poem involves the conflation of these poetic and musical qual- ities in a genre which is itself a conflation of the codes of language and music. Finally, the con- ventional use of Auflosung in nineteenth-cen- tury century aesthetic theory shows it to be of</page><page sequence="8">444 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism real importance to our understanding of this era and its synaesthetic orientation.

In a letter to Claude Debussy of 1899 following a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, Pierre Louys pleaded: "You must really hurry up and reform music because things can't go on as they have been for the last fifteen years. We have got to the point where a chord cannot be resolved without pretending to resolve some problem of God himself." Quoted in Edward Lockspeiser, Debussy (New York: McGraw Hill, 1972). 2.
