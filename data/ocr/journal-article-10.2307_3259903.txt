<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWENTIETH CENTURY ART FRANK STELLA American, born I936 Haines City 1963 Acrylic on canvas 99 X 99 in. (251.5 X z51.5 cm) Gift of Stanley Crantson, 1988 I988.223 Frank Stella's early works reveal the gestural spontaneity of Abstract Expressionism that influenced many of his contem- poraries. However, by 1958 Stella began to paint in a more austere and geometric manner, predating the Minimalism of the mid-9g60s. His compositions of 1958-59 were highly controlled in terms of color and structure and introduced motifs that dominated his work for the next ten years: the square, the stripe, the chevron, and the polygon. Stella developed a startling array of imagery using these basic elements. Stella pioneered the shaped canvas in 1960, and Haines City is a particularly fine example that was painted during the summer of I963, while Stella was an artist-in-residence at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire; it is part of a series named after Florida cities. The overall configuration of this work is an X, which is divided by vertical and horizontal axes into four equal hexagons. Within each hexagon Stella has meticulously painted yellow chevron-shaped stripes, leaving a thin line of unpainted canvas exposed between each stripe. While the points of the chevrons draw our attention to the center of the canvas, the four "pointed" corners of the canvas pull our eye outward. The result is a composition of subtle tension and lyrical rhythm. Haines City is the second painting by Stella to enter the Museum's collection; the other is Marrakech, painted in I964.

(63.5 x 48.3 cm) Signed and dated (lower right): Max Weber I915 Gift of Joy S. Weber, I988 I988.z86 In 1915, at the height of his experimentation with Cubist and Futurist abstraction, Max Weber produced this pastel, The Apollo in Matisse's Studio. The work is a blend of representational and abstract elements, suggestive of the environment in which Weber had studied. Matisse's informal academy had opened in January I908 with eight students, including the Americans Sarah Stein (Gertrude Stein's sister-in-law), Patrick Henry Bruce, and Max Weber, who attended regular sessions until July of I908. For the following three years, the classes continued and enrollment increased. In general, the program was tradi- tional, with an emphasis on drawing and painting from plaster casts and live models, modeling figures in clay, and painting still lifes. One of the plaster casts, from a sixth- century B.C. bronze Biton (Delphi Museum), is presented in the lower right of this drawing. Although the actual cast (Musee Matisse, Nice-Cimiez) measured 8I/ feet in height, Weber's rendering of it is dwarfed by the abstract shapes in the background. From January through February 1915 at the Montross Gallery in New York, Matisse had a large one-man show of seventy-four works: paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints. It is likely that this exhibition inspired Weber to recall his previous studies with Matisse.

(40.6 x 31.1 cm) Purchase, Malcolm Hewitt Wiener Foundation Gift, I988 i988.i98 Marsden Hartley spent much of his adult life traveling between his native Maine, New York, and Europe. Although many important people respected his work, among them Alfred Stieglitz, Hartley never felt completely satisfied with the recognition that he received or at home in his various surroundings. In October 1941 (two years before his death), a large exhibition of his work opened at the Cincinnati Modern Art Society. The success of the show inspired opti- mism, and in 1942 two New York galleries included his work in their shows. Hartley remained in New York from January until the end of spring and later that year wrote an essay called "Falling in Love with New York." Hartley's enthusiasm also found expression in a series of '. drawings that depict New York. Among them is this black- _ B, ': and-white study of The Cloisters. Located at the north end of Manhattan, high on a hill, The Cloisters overlooks, to the west and northwest, the Hudson River and the cliffs of the Palisades. Judging by the densely foliated trees in the fore- ground, this lively sketch of the south side of The Cloisters, drawn with sure outlines and deep shading, was probably GASTON LACHAISE made in the late spring of 1942, four years after it opened to American, 1882-1935 the public.

This past year the Museum received from the V7 V**i^^^B^B^^^HI^ | qLachaise Foundation three drawings that were done late in his career, between 1925 and I934. The walking nude illus- trated here is a study of exaggerated form and expressive curves. In profile, her pendulous breasts and wide buttocks are isolated and emphasized by heavy outlines. Lachaise's worshipful reverence for this earth-mother image is akin to I ''"' ' t-MM t,, / Ji ' 'the evocation of fertility idols in primitive societies. LMM ,.

Hearn Fund, I989 I989.8I Since the early I96os, Richard Artschwager has worked as both a painter and a sculptor in a style that has consistently resisted classification. Frequently anticipating artistic trends, he followed an individual course that bridges Pop Art, Minimalism, Photo-realism, Environmental Art, and Con- ceptualism. He has continuously exploited the textural and contextual effects of the two commercial products Celotex and Formica in his canvases and sculpture. Typical of his paintings in its subject matter, technique, and grisaille palette, Men's Dormitory depicts an interior setting and its furnishings: A large hospital ward is filled with rows of metal bunk beds. Two uniformed female attendants stand, presumably straightening up the bedding, in an otherwise silent and deserted room. The composition is based on a photograph and has been sketched out on a Celotex panel (a paper compound with a rough and textured surface) over which Artschwager has applied layers of acrylic paint; the creation of a speckled, slightly out-of-focus effect corresponds to the grainy half- tones of the original newspaper photograph. Like the art of Neil Jenney, whose painting appears on the opposite page, Artschwager's work treads a tenuous, but distinct, balance between what is illusion and what is reality. So, too, he applies a specific frame to help distinguish between the two, in this case, a mirrorlike aluminum frame-strips of prefab- ricated molding-that reflects the constantly shifting light.

(5II.I x I81.3 cm) Titled on frame: MAN AND CHALLENGE Denise and Andrew Saul Fund, 1988 I988.I6I The American artist Neil Jenney was twenty-four years old when he painted this picture in 1969. After starting his career as a sculptor in 1967, he began to paint during the summer of 1969. In the works that followed over the next year and a half, among them Man and Challenge, Jenney combined a gestural painting technique with a descriptive portrayal of his subjects in such a manner that the viewer is required to acknowledge or imagine the connection between the two. Here, the artist, contemplating his recent effort to toss playing cards into a hat, sits with his back to the viewer on a wooden chair. The scene takes place against a planked floor of loosely smeared brown acrylic paint. The heavy black wooden frame is lettered with the title Man and Challenge, which is both descriptive and editorial, as it suggests far greater feats of heroism than depicted here. Frame, title, image, and brushwork, in this deceptively straightforward painting, vie for equal attention. Jenney's work of the late I96os has been called "new image" painting and is often seen as an offshoot of Pop Art. How- ever, while Pop Art appropriated flamboyant icons of com- mercial and consumer usage, Jenney selected ordinary images from everyday life. Works like Man and Challenge also anticipate by several years the reemergence of figurative painting in the 197os and I980s.

(157.5 X SI0.5 x o16.7 cm) Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, I988 1988.257 a-u Ursula von Rydingsvard brings strong memories of her early childhood into her contemporary sculpted works. Born in Germany during World War ii, she and her Polish parents were forced to live in a labor camp and, after the war, in a camp for refugees. In 1950, at the age of eight, she moved permanently to the United States, where she still resides. Von Rydingsvard first used cedar beams as her sole sculpting material in 1976, a year after receiving a master of fine arts degree from Columbia University. The soft cedar beams were glued or clamped together, laminated, and then ground, sawed, and chiseled into shape, leaving the edges jagged and scarred. Their drab brown color and weathered surfaces recall the wooden barns and barracks of the wartime camps. In this modular sculpture, tinted with powdered graphite, von Rydingsvard creates an imposing barricade with seven large pyramidal forms. The sense of enclosure is important to the artist, and the V-shaped openings created between the wooden units integrate the sculpture with its surroundings. Although repetitive in shape and placement, these structures assume an anthropomorphic quality in their individualized chiseling and scale.

(55.9 X 78.7 cm) Gift of Timothy, Anther, and Alycia Kiley, 1989 I989.179 a, b Constantino Nivola was born in Sardinia in 191I and came to the United States in 1939, after studying with the sculptor Marino Marini. During the 1950S Nivola's reputation was established with commissioned sculptural reliefs and sand-cast murals. His sculpture Mother's Secret is one of several related works created by the artist in the decade before his death in 1988. The styles and subjects of these works reflect a new direction and focus in the artist's oeuvre. As in other examples of this period in his work, Mother's Secret evokes a gracefully elegant female form without being overly representational. Here, a thin rectangular piece of rose marble, curved at the bottom edges, fans out horizontally like two outstretched arms ready to embrace. From the front, a small, undefined head projects upward, and below it, a rounded mound protrudes from the center, resembling the stomach of a pregnant woman. From the back, the figure is equally sim- plified, with more linear and vertical motifs representing the back of the head, the spine, and the buttocks area. The sleekly polished marble, pink and subtly veined, suggests the look and feel of smooth skin. Despite its relatively small size the image is sparse, sensual, and monumental.

Blum Fund, I988 1988.311 This large, over six-foot-square canvas was painted by the young American artist David Krueger in 1987, when he was just twenty-eight years old. In size and content it was an ambitious undertaking, and the results reflect a surprisingly mature handling of paint and composition. The work is filled with ambiguous and disturbing narrative details whose meanings are partially revealed by the words lettered along the two borders: "Wild Life Branta Canadensis." Like that of Neil Jenney's painting Man and Challenge (reproduced on page 67), Krueger's title is as ironic as it is descriptive. In Latin Branta canadensis is the classification for Canada goose, and indeed, this painting is populated by a swarm of flying waterfowl, one of which looms large in the foreground. As a comparison to the live birds, however, a mechanical wooden goose, reminiscent of those seen in a carnival shoot- ing gallery, is attached to a wooden nesting stand, which the artist describes as "a resting place, an island of security in the middle of [a] man-made, cultivated environment." The bright green mechanism of the goose commands attention in this otherwise bleak and colorless setting. A smoggy sky and gray-black field enhance the foreboding sense of this scene. Krueger questions the possible repercussions of modern tech- nology on the environment by juxtaposing several giant-size red potatoes (the product of scientific development) against the natural beauty and apparent freedom of the migrating birds, whose legs, however, are noticeably tagged with metal bands. The artist makes a play on the word "wildlife," which refers here both to the wildlife themselves, and to their existence in the wild, which seems threatened by man- made advances.

(I38.4 x 9z.I cm) Purchase, Anonymous Gift, I989 I989.82 While the art of Leon Kossoff has eluded specific classification for thirty years, his penetrating portrait studies have allied him with such British figurative realists of the post-World War ii era as Frank Auerbach, Lucien Freud, and Peter Blake. Depicting groups of figures in both urban settings and single portraits, Kossoff's work is highly expressionistic. Paint is built up thickly, as well as drizzled over the surface, in complex skeins that weave a web around the subject. The addition of heavy linseed oil to the oil pigments of the paints has produced an unusually fluid appearance that has led some writers to describe Kossoff's surfaces as "oily skin." Canvases may take several months to complete as the artist continually scrapes and repaints in a process of destruction and re-creation. Kossoff depicts himself, his family, and friends in portraits that are injected with personalized experiences. In this work the artist's brother Chaim, a bespectacled middle-aged man, is seen casually dressed in a sweater and tie; he sits in a red chair, hands clasped across his stomach. His head tilts to one side, and his eyes are closed as if he were napping. The space of the composition is severely compressed, so that the figure seems to sit on the actual canvas surface. The colors of the painting are relatively dark and muted, with strong linear accents in black. This is one of the largest and most com- plete portraits of Chaim that Kossoff painted between I985 and I988, and it captures the sitter's solid dignity and, perhaps, quiet forbearance.

(zio.8 cm) Gift of Cynthia Hazen Polsky, 1988 1988.388.2 In the first years of this century, avant-garde artists reacted against what they saw as the excesses of the highly stylized, naturalistic ornamentation of the prevalent Art Nouveau mode. In Austria such advocates for change were affiliated with two organizations: the Secession and Wiener Werkstatte. Koloman Moser was a founding member of both groups. This cabinet is a remarkable example of the new design aesthetic. The case has been reduced to a simple rectangular mass, consisting of three pairs of doors with fielded panels. Decoration has been limited to the blue-and-white color scheme, the use of stained glass in the upper doors, and a discreet beading accenting the frame. This minimal type of design had a relatively short life in Vienna and was soon replaced by an exuberant neoclassical revival. However, it remains one of the most influential modes of this century, having exerted a strong influence on Modernist designers in the years immediately after World War I and more recently in the post-Vietnam period. RCM MARCEL BREUER American, born in Hungary, I902z-981 "Wassily" Armchair I925 Tubular steel and canvas Height, 30/4 in. (76.8 cm) Purchase, Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift, 1988 I988.256 Marcel Breuer's major career as a furniture designer spanned only three decades. However, his innovative use of tubular steel in the I9zos and molded plywood in the two suc- ceeding decades has remained influential throughout the twentieth century. This armchair-produced when Breuer was twenty-three years old-was his first masterwork. In his characteristic manner, Breuer has reconceived the ubiquitous lounge chair in a radical way: A lightweight frame of tubu- lar steel supports taut panels of fabric. This example is also exceptional in that the period canvas upholstery as well as the original chromeplating have been preserved. This semi- nal Modernist design enters the Metropolitan's collection more than six decades after its creation.

(96.8 cm) I988.256 Gift of Open Ark, The Netherlands, 1989 I989.48 In 1849 Thomas B. Warren patented a remarkable seating piece, the centripetal spring chair, which was manufactured by the American Chair Company of Troy, New York. (An example is housed in the Museum's American Wing.) The chair was exhibited two years later at the Crystal Palace in London and was one of the first American furniture designs to achieve international acclaim. The surface of the chair was embellished with Victorian polychromy, patterning, and 311!: -: ~ fringes; but in terms of form and construction, the centripe- tal spring chair marked a radical departure from traditional four-legged armchairs. Almost a century and a half later, it is possible to see Warren's design as among the first prototypes for one of the most important pieces of modern furniture-the office chair. In terms of form, these chairs clearly delineate seat, back, headrest, and armrests as distinct elements; the base most often consists of a pedestal supported by multiple stretchers with casters. Most importantly, the office chair responds to the movement of the sitter, in that it can tilt, swivel, and roll. The mechanization of what was once a static seating form was made possible by the enormous advances in technology after I830. In Warren's example cast iron and wood were used. Subsequent generations of designers have employed other innovations: flat bar steel by Frank Lloyd Wright, tubu- lar steel by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, fiberglass by Eero j^^^^^ |||^ f;^^ ~ Saarinen, and cast aluminum by Charles Eames. To these classic office chairs presently in the Metropolitan's collection, an exceptional example has been added: the "Vertebra" armchair by Emilio Ambasz and Giancarlo Piretti. 1989.48 RCM 73</page></plain_text>
