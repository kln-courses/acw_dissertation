<plain_text><page sequence="1">NAZCA POTTERY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY GEORGE B. MARTIN-VEGUE PLATES XL, B-XL VI, B THE discovery of the first site of the Nazca ware is particularly illustrative of the fact that pottery, literally, can be the guide to a civilization. Prior to 1901 the ar- chaeological world knew of only some half dozen pieces of pottery of the type now known as Nazca. During a visit to a Berlin museum, Dr. Max Uhle, a German archaeologist who had long worked in South America, saw four pieces of the beautiful ware and noticed on the museum card the location in Peru from which they had come. In 1900 Dr. Uhle led an expedition to the south coast of Peru and, by means of the evidence furnished by a simple potsherd of the Nazca type which he perceived lying on the sand, he was able to uncover a new part of the mysterious history of Peru., The Nazca culture that Dr. Uhle found in the early years of the century remains one of the most interesting representatives of the early civilizations of the Peruvian area.2 Its center is in the dry coastal valleys of the Nazca and Ica rivers on the south coast. Perhaps the most interesting remains are the textiles and the pottery. The brightly colored Nazca textiles are intricately woven and they show a variety of complex designs. Like the textiles, the pottery is original in its conception. In shape the Nazca ware is rather distinctive. Low bowls and cups, goblets, tall vases, bell shaped jars, and vessels with two projecting parallel spouts connected by a flat bridge comprise the most common shapes, although there is pronounced variation within each of these shape categories. Modeling is of only secondary importance in the Nazca pottery since it is used mainly to heighten the design rather than to alter the shape of the ware. Although the earliest Nazca designs are essen- tially naturalistic and are easily recognizable, they are not pictorial. It is common to find the designs outlined in black and to find human heads, birds, mice, llamas, fruits, seeds, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic creatures, and a variety of geometric patterns repre- sented on the Nazca ware. The naturalism of the early designs tends to become increasingly conventionalized in the later phases of the culture. While shape and design both characterize Nazca pottery, its vivid colors which include white, black, two shades of red, two of yellow, two of brown, grey, flesh, and violet are perhaps its most distinctive features. From three to eight colors are used on each piece, with white, black and red predominating in the designs. Mainly by the use of shape, but by the use of design and color to a lesser degree, Nazca pot- tery breaks down into three main classes, Nazca-A, the early style, Nazca-X, a transitional style between Nazca-A and Nazca-B, and Nazca-B, the late style.3 1 Dr. Uhle tells his own story of the discovery of the Nazca culture in "The Nazca pottery of early Peru," Proceedings of the Davenport Academy of Science, XIII (1913), pp. 3-6. 2 Although authorities differ greatly in their esti- mates, approximate dates of the Nazca period are 600-900 A.D. according to Wendell C. Bennett, "Archaeology of the Central Andes," Handbook of South American Indians (Washington, U.S. Govern- ment printing office, 1946), p. 80. I The breakdown of Nazca pottery according to shapes follows the work of Gayton and Kroeber in their study of the Uhle collection of Nazca pottery at the University of California. These authors based this deduction on a study of designs on Nazca pot- tery in which they noted that from Nazca-A through X and B the designs become increasingly more con- ventionalized and stylized, a fairly obvious although not an absolutely conclusive indication of the growth and maturity of an art form. A. H. Gayton, and A. L. 345</page><page sequence="2">3846 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY In Florida State University's collection of Nazca pottery4 there are forty-one vessels of style A. Of these, twenty-six are low bowls, twelve of which have a round bottom as the one shown in the first picture on pl. XLV, B, and fourteen have a rather flat bottom and an- gular sides as in pl.

XLVI, B, no. 8, by their more vertical sides and their more acute base angle. The three remaining bowls of style A are typical double-spout jars (pl. XLIII, B, no. 7), with ovoid bodies and two almost parallel spouts on top connected by a short, flat bridge. The designs of the Nazca-A vessels of the collection are comparatively simple for the most part. (See table 1.) The most common designs are the forms of birds (pl. XLII, A, no. 1), Kroeber, The Uhle pottery collection from Nazca (Uni- versity of California publications in American archae- ology and ethnology, XXIV, No. 1, Berkeley, Uni- versity of California press, 1927), pp. 1-46. Photo- graphs of the vessels used for this paper were sub- mitted to Dr. Gordon R. Willey, who made a tenta- tive classification; this paper does not follow Willey's classification in all respects. 4 This pottery forms a part of the Mary Carter and the John V. Carter collection of Peruvian antiquities at Florida State University. The complete collection consists not only of Nazca pottery, but of pottery and textiles from several other leading cultures of the Peruvian area and a great many wooden and metal objects of interest from the pre-Spanish period. 6 Hereinafter references to pictures will have a Roman numeral and letter to designate the plate and an Arabic numeral to identify the vessel on the plate. The numbers are assigned to the vessels beginning with the upper register and reading from left to right.</page><page sequence="3">NAZCA POTTERY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY 347 serpents (pl. XLV, B, no. 5), fish (pl. XLIV, A, no. 3), pods (pl. XLIV, A, no. 4), leaves (pl. XLII, A, no. 2), or frogs (pl. XLVI, B, no. 4), used either alone or as a decorative band encircling the vessel as shown in pl. XLVI, B, no. 8. In only the instance of the vessel illustrated in pl. XLVI, B, no. 5 does the decorative band occur on the inner rim of the bowl, although five of of the round-bottom bowls have their decorations on the inside in the bottom of the vessel. At least two different types of fish appear in the designs, one short and almost round as in pl. XLIV, A, nos. 3 and 6, the other longer and thinner as in pl. XLVI, B, no. 8. There is also more than a single type of bird shown in the decorative painting: a water type as shown in pl. XLI, A, no. 3, a hawk or parrot type of pl. XLIII, B, no. 3, and possibly a third type some- what similar to the water bird as in pl. XL, B, no. 2. Plate XLV, A, no. 4 is unusual in showing both a bird and a fish, the fish apparently ready to consume the bird. Less realistic are the hands and heads that appear on several vessels. These designs are usually in a decorative band on the vessel (see pl. XLI, A, no. 92 and XLVI, A, no. 5 respectively). The unusual figures which comprise the band of pl. XLII, A, no. 3 are perhaps heads, but they are rigidly conven- tionalized if this is true. Although the pattern in pl. XLIV, A, no. I in the bottom of the round bottom bowl is distinctive, it is difficult to decide whether this design is actually a star or merely a geometric figure. 111dw WO OWN ONOI FIG. 1. THE CENTIPEDE DEMON (Drawing by Thomas Freeman) In the style A vessels two have designs which probably portray some mythological fig- ures. The figure on pl. XLIII, B, no. 4, reminiscent of the centipede, has a long body with wave-like spines. (fig. 1.) The body is rounded at the end which almost reaches around the vessel to the lower part of the face. Down the center of the body is a narrow band divided into several sections, each of which has the eyes and mouth of another face. "This is not sur- prising, for the Nazca artists put faces everywhere."" The head of the figure shows a face in the form of a mask below a three-lobed crown. The eyes of the mask are closed and the tongue is long and pointed, while from the pointed ears hang long pendants somewhat re- sembling in shape the hands in pl. XLII, B, no. 3. The other mythological figure is merely a head with no body. The head has the same three-lobed crown as the centipede head, as well as the hand-like pendants and the long, pointed tongue. This face, however, has only a half mask over the upper part and two tentacle-like projections from either side of the lower part. Most frequent among the other design elements found in the style A vessels are the geo- metric patterns. These consist of parallel straight (pl. XLIV, A, no. 1) and parallel wavy lines (pl. XLV, B, no. 2), triangles (pl. XLVI, B, no. 6), steps (pl. XLVI: A, no. 1), frets (pl. XLII, B, 6 Edward K. Putnam, "The Davenport collection the Davenport Academy of Sciences, XIII (1913), p. of Nazca and other Peruvian pottery," Proceedings of 29.</page><page sequence="4">348 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY no. 1), and other symmetrical patterns in regular sequence, as those of pl. XLV, B, no. 4 and pl. XLVI, B, no. 2. A separating line partitions off repetitive designs in a semi-geometric pat- tern, as in pl. XLVI, B, no. 1 and pl. XLV, B, no. 1. Another device similar to the separating lines is the spine-like projections all connected to an encircling band as in pl. XLV, A, no. 1; these spines closely resemble the spine-edges of the centipede figure and may well be a part of that figure used as a separate motive. Plates XLIV, A, no. 2 and XLII, B, no. 2 show yet another geometric type design with lines coming from the sides of the vessel which cross on the bottom and thus quarter the base. FIG. t. THE BIRD DEMON (Drawing by Thomas Freeman) The style A vessels have a range of from three to seven colors on each piece, with four and five color combinations predominating. Dark red, white, and black are most frequently used in the three-color combinations. Red-orange and then grey or brown are added to make the four- and the five-color combinations. The six-color ware utilizes both the brown and the grey and sometimes substitutes yellow for one or the other; seven-color combinations utilize all three. In the basic red, black, and white combinations a light yellow or cream sometimes substitutes for the white.' In background the dark colors, either red or black, are used al- most as frequently as white. (See tables II and III.) There are twelve vessels of the intermediate or style X type in the Florida State Uni- versity collection. Of these twelve, three are low, conical bowls, as in pl. XLII, B, no. 7. Plate XLI, A, no. I is an example of the three low, bulbous jars with slightly flaring mouths that appear in the collection. There are five narrow-mouth jars, another of the style X shapes; of these, plates XL, B, no. 4 and XLVI, A, no. 7 differ from the others by having small handles on the upper bulge of their oblique, spheroidal bodies. The handles are too small to be practi- cable as carrying handles but look as though they, perhaps, served as a means of suspending the vessels. As the style X is transitory between the Nazca-A and the Nazca-B, its conical bowl approximates the shape of the style A round-bottom bowl while the bulbous style X jar very nearly approximates the bulbous found in the style B shapes.8 In the same way that the shapes which are similar to style A shapes occur in style X, frequently X designs are quite similar to the A designs. Other designs of style X frequently ' An accurate definition of colors is particularly difficult to give due to the fact that on a great many of the vessels the colors are badly faded or deteri- orated. Because of the proximity of the hues of light yellow and white, of light brown and red, and of other nearly alike colors, positive descriptions of these colors is questionable. In defining the colors, Gayton and Kroeber's terms are used. Gayton and Kroeber, The Uhle collection, p. 10. 8 Compare the round-bottom bowl of pl. XLII, A, no. 3 with the conical one of pl. XLV, B, no. 6, and the style X bulbous jar of pl. XLI, A, no. 1 with the style B bulbous jar pictured in pl. xLI, B, no. 8.</page><page sequence="5">NAZCA POTTERY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY 349 forecast some of the style B patterns. It is the occurrence of designs typical to style A and B shapes that has caused Nazca-X to be given its intermediate position in time. Of the twelve style X vessels, five have naturalistic type designs. Plate XLIII, A, no. 4 shows a pod or leaf design. On one of the handled jars (pl. XL, B, no. 4) on either side of the upper part of the vessel appears a bird which resembles rather closely the waterbird found in the designs of the style A vessels. The two narrow-mouth jars in pl. XLII, A have a series of heads which completely encircle the upper parts of the vessels. In pl. XLII, A, no. 6 these heads are in profile and show some stylization. The top of the head is flat as is the front of the face except for the protruding nose. The hair hangs at the back of the head in what appears to be three braids while the open, grimacing mouth shows several teeth which ap- pear as short, straight lines. The heads of pl. XLII, A, no. 4 show a front view of the face, and the hair is a black mass which hangs from the back part of the head toward the lower TABLE II COLOR FREQUENCY Number of colors A X B Y Misc. 3 8 1 2 2 4 12 2 6 1 5 16 2 12 1 1 6 2 6 6 7 3 1 7 8 1 41 12 34 3 2 TABLE III BACKGROUND FREQUENCY Background color A X B Y Misc.

The face features consist merely of three short, straight lines, two of which represent eyes, the other the mouth. From the upper side of the face emanates a cord-like line which seems to have a knot in the middle and to have a tassel on the end. In describing the Davenport collection of Nazca pottery, Putnam suggests that this cord may have been used to suspend the heads of victims,9 although usually one does not think of such san- guinary practices in connection with the pre-Inca Peruvians. On the outer rim of the conical bowl shown in pl. XLV, A, no. 7 is an encircling design of animals, so stylized as to make ac- curate recognition difficult. These animals have bird-like feet and rather humped bodies 9 Edward K. Putnam, "The Davenport collection of the Davenport Academy of Sciences, XIII (1913), of Nazca and other Peruvian pottery," Proceedings p. 25.</page><page sequence="6">350 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY with small, round protuberances along their backs. Their heads have long, bird-like beaks and sit upon thin curving necks. Mythological figures appear on three vessels of the style X type. The cat demon (fig. 3) is the name commonly given to the figure appearing on the narrow-mouth jar, pl. XLIII, B, no. 1. This formidable looking creature has what may be called a human face and hands. The head is turned to show a full face which wears a three-lobed crown similar to that noted in connection with the centipede demon. The face has a feline or cat appearance caused by a mask which covers its lower part and extends with wing-like projections to each side of the mouth. Each of these wing-like extensions contains a crude human face in its outer extremity. The dark-colored upper part of the face gives the appearance of yet a second FIG. 3. THE CAT DEMON (Drawing by Thomas Freeman) mask covering the eyes. Across the forehead is a masklike figure with a simplified human face in the center, the three-lobed crown, and the wing-like extensions to the side. On either side of the face are three disk-like pendants which are, perhaps, ear decorations. The right arm extends beyond the face and grasps a staff, while the left reaches below the face and appears to be holding a human head. The remainder of the body trails off from the lower part of the face and ends in two short human legs and feet. A suggestion of navel and genitals appears in the center of the body and between the legs respectively. From the lower part of the head a trailing body with spine-like projections, somewhat reminiscent of the centi- pede body, extends to an upcurving tail which ends in a human head complete with pointed tongue and hand-like pendants. This trailing body may well be meant as a headdress for the figure. Between each of the spine-like projections on its upper side is a portion of a highly conventionalized human head. The other demon figure is a stylized version of the jagged-staff demon which will be fully described with the Nazca-B style pottery of the collection. A series of these figures surround the outer rim of pl. XLV, B, no. 6. The figure has no face but merely a decorated center por- tion topped by a three-pointed crown. On either side of the crown is a hand, and a series of tentacle-like projections extend in all directions from the body of the figure. The double- handle jar in pl. XLVI, A, no. 7 shows a demon figure with a body somewhat similar to that of the cat demon, with the same upturned tail ending in a human head and with the same spine- like projections of the body. The face, however, is entirely different and appears in profile rather than full face. There is no crown and the mask now takes the form of two long ears protruding from the upper part of the face. The only hand that appears on the figure is at- tached to one of the lower spines of the body.</page><page sequence="7">NAZCA POTTERY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY 351 Geometric designs appear slightly less frequently in style X vessels than in those of style A. Cross-hatch, parallel wavy lines, and frets appear on the vessels as geometric patterns and in pl. XLII, B, no. 4 a series of wavy, intertwined lines comprise a semi-geometric pat- tern. Three vessels (pls. XLII, B, no. 7, XLV, A, no. 7 and XLV, B, no. 6) have designs which di- vide the bottoms into quarters, but unlike the quartered vessels of style A, these vessels have alternate light and dark sections. It is noticeable that these three vessels, while closely resembling the round-bottom bowls of style A, are all decorated on the outside, while the style A decorations frequently occur on the inside of the bowls, as in pl. XLIV, A, nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. On the style X vessels of the collection there is a predominance of a six-color combination which appears on half of the pieces. As in style A, the range of color combinations is from three to seven colors on each vase. Flesh color appears in two of the designs. Occurring ten times on the twelve vessels, white is by far the most common background color. (See tables II and III.) In contrast to style A, style B, with the exception of head-and-spout jars, contains ves- sels of tall and narrow proportions. Thirty-five vessels of the Florida State University col- lection appear to be style B. Thirteen of these are goblets: three, an angled goblet (as in pl. XLV, A, no. 8); nine, a curved goblet with an out-flaring rim (as in pl. XLIII, B, no. 5); and one, a conical goblet (pictured in pl. XLII, B, no. 6). The vases have considerable variation in shape, but four small vases (as exemplified by pl. XLIII, B, no. 2), three cylindrical vases (as in pl. XL, B, no. 6), and six bulbous vases (as in pl. XLI, A, no. 5), represent these shapes in the collection. Plate XL, B, no. 7 shows an extreme variation of the cylindrical shape. Some- what similar to the double-spout jars of style A is the collection's single head-and-spout jar (pl. XL, B, no. 8), in which a simple modeled head replaces one of the spouts of the style A double-spout jar. The nine remaining vessels are all modeled vessels; pl. XL, B, no. 3 is an example of seven which have the shapes of heads, while the remaining two which have the shapes of modeled figures are illustrated in pl. XL, B, no. 1. The modeling found on the head and figure jars is mainly of secondary importance and appears only in style B. It is confined merely to a pinching up of clay to suggest nose, mouth, and ears. On the figure-vases (pl. XL, B, no. I and XLVI, A, no. 6) the remaining face features as well as the legs and arms are represented by means of drawing and colors. In each of the modeled faces is a decorative patch suggestive of tatoo markings either surrounding the eye, under the eye, or, in the case of pl. XLIII, A, no. 5, even extending across the bridge of the nose. The modeled figure shown in pl. XLVI, A, no. 6 has a leaf or a fruit in each hand. In the style B, as in the A and X styles, geometric figures appear frequently on the ves- sels. The geometric designs used on the style B vessels are overlapping lines, contiguous rows of diamonds and triangles, triangles with the base of one upon the apex of the next, cross- hatch, parallel lines, encircling bands, interrupted lines, checks, rectangles, dots, and steps. Generally the naturalistic designs found in style A no longer appear in style B. A possible exception is pl. XLI, B, no. 2, which has two encircling bands of arrows. In pl. XLIII, B, no. 5 a stylized, interlocking fish design around the upper part of the vessel has replaced the nat- uralistic fish of the style A designs. Notable in several style B vessels is the use of fill-in patterns that are not geometrical but which seem simply to serve the purpose of occupying space. One of these fill-in patterns occurs on pl. XL, B, no. 6 in the band above the demon figure, another on pl. xL, B, no. 7 in the band between the face series. A number of different head or face series appear on the style B vessels in the form of</page><page sequence="8">35 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ornamental bands which use the human face in rows running around the pot. Plate XLV, A, no. 8 illustrates one type of head series and has a row of full faces with wide open eyes. The same series becomes slightly more naturalistic in pl. XL, B, no. 7 by means of the convex bulges in the vase which match the faces and give them a rounded appearance. A second type on the upper band of pl. XLI, B, no. 6 shows highly conventionalized faces in profile with pointed nose and chin and with the other face features but poorly distinguished. The lower band of the same vase contains yet a third face series. This design shows a full oval face with three dots comprising the eyes and mouth features. A long strand of hair hanging between the faces separates each one from those next to it. The series which appears in pl. XLIII, A, no. 6 is similar except that the faces are triangular instead of oval. An example of another face series appears in pl. XLIII, B, no. 8. This conventionalized face appears in the U-shaped ends of the undulating design on the vase and thin white lines extend from the top of the head to suggest hair. Perhaps the design closest to a full scene in the whole collection appears in pl. XLI, B, no. 8. This vessel shows a full human form with a profile head. On top of the head is a round headpiece with a face. The body seems somewhat out of proportion to the head. The right arm holds a bunch of arrows aloft, while the left holds something resembling a fan. The numerous demon creatures of the style B vessels are an outstanding design charac- teristic. The cat demon described under the style X designs appears in almost exactly the same form in pl. XLIII, B, nos. 9 and 6. The design of pl. XLVI, B, no. 3 portrays another in- teresting type of demon creature, this one often called the bird demon. The creature has a human head with a three-lobed crown and two long, hanging ear pendants. From the lower part of the head a long, U-shaped body trails back supported by two bird feet, while from the upper section of the head the wing trails to the rear. The forward part of the wing con- sists of a conventionalized face with a mass of hair which falls below the face. A narrow spine- like band runs along the top of the body, and a series of tail feathers protruding to the rear completes the picture. A slightly different version of the bird demon appears in pl. XLIV, B, no. 5. On this figure a second face is added to the forward part of the wing, and the face features appear at the rear of the U-shaped body. Most prominent are the differences in the head, which is here bird-like and which replaces the human head of the bird demon de- scribed above. A round crown, a single eye, and a beak are the distinguishing features of this head. Yet a third bird-demon, shown in figure 2, has a turkey-like head and a body made up of parts of three conventionalized faces. The spine-like back, bird-like feet, and rear feathers remain the same on this creature as on the other bird demons. Below the head of the turkey a human head hangs from the body. A demon creature with a body quite similar to that of the cat demon appears in pl. XLIII, A, no. 2. Between each of the spine-like projec- tions down the back of the demon there is a conventionalized plant. The face on this vessel is long and oval, with a mask similar to that of the jagged-staff face of pl. XLIII, B, NO. 7; the right hand of the figure grasps a staff of some kind. On pl. XLI, A, no. 5 a highly stylized fig- ure, obviously a demon creature, is so treated as to be difficult to recognize. The face is featureless except for two eyes set below an irregular three-lobed crown. Two hands stretch above the head while below the head a short, upturned, fish-like body ends in a triangle. Other triangle decorations spring from the body at different places. The demon on the vase of pl. XL, B, no. 7 is commonly referred to as the jagged-staff demon. Of all the demon creatures, it is probably the most stylized and appears in the most varied forms. Hanging below the face are the hand-like pendants so often found in connec- tion with the other demon faces, while a long, thin tongue hangs from the mouth. The crown</page><page sequence="9">NAZCA POTTERY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY 353 has a miniature face in the center and the usual three lobes. The middle lobe extends into a long, jagged staff with two right-angled bends to bring it to the side so as to avoid the legs. Below the jagged staff is a short skirt and a long, thin pair of human legs. A variation of this same demon is the one shown in pl. XL, B, no. 6. The triangular face has a mask over the up- per part and a sharp, pointed tongue protruding from the lower part. The two hand- pendants proceed from the chin and form an inverted V below the face. Extending above the top of the head is a small, U-shaped body. A number of tentacle-like projections protrude from the hanging pendants, the head, and the body of the figure, giving it the look of a spider, a centipede, or some other many-legged creature. In the same way that the type B designs are more complex than the preceding ones, the use of color shows greater variety. The range of color combinations goes all the way from FIG. 4. THE JAGGED STAFF DEMON IN VARIOUS PHASES. A. left; B. center; C. lower right; D. upper right. (Drawing by Thomas Freeman) three to eight different colors on a single vessel. Twelve of the style B vessels have five-color designs; four, six, and seven-color combinations appear with almost equal frequency, occur- ring six, six, and seven times respectively. (See table II.) Light backgrounds predominate in the style B ware, with white and light yellow or cream used in over three-fourths of the ves- sels. (See table III.) Violet appears on one vessel, but otherwise the frequency of the use of colors remains the same as for style X. Two vessels of the collection belong to a fourth stylistic division, Nazea-Y. Style Y is probably not pure Nazea and has no set patterns of shape as do the main styles A, X, and B. Elements typical of Nazea combine with elements typical of other cultures, such as the Tiahuanaco and Ica, to constitute style Y. Plate XLVI, A, no. 2 shows a small jar which has neither a Nazea shape nor design. Only the vivid red and the light brown of the black-edged design seem typical of Nazea ware. The vessel of pl. XLII, B, no. 8 is another classified as be- longing to style Y. It is a round-bottom bowl with upright, slightly flaring sides. The design</page><page sequence="10">354 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY is in three colors and consists of geometric patterns and a deteriorated jagged-staff demon. This demon is quite different from either of those described under style B. All traces of body and hands have disappeared; only a single eye looks out of a body composed entirely of long, tentacle-like protuberances. The seventh jar on pl. XLVI, B is a single-spout jar with a flat, curving handle which goes from the tube to the top of the jar. The rosette or star-shaped figure is the conventionalized jagged staff demon in a final phase. A single eye in the center of a group of tentacles comprises the whole figure. The remainder of the decoration is com- posed of irregular designs, one of which is an irregular band with the familiar spine-like pro- jections. Figure 4 shows the four stages of the jagged-staff demon. The left-hand drawing A, shows the most naturalistic creature of the group, that pictured in pl. XL, B, no. 7. B (pictured in pl. XL, B, no. 6) and C (pl. XLV, B, no. 6) show yet further extremes in conventionalization, while D (pl. XLVI, B, no. 7) shows a final phase of the demon. It is by noting such changes in the designs of the Nazea ware that authorities first established a time sequence for the styles A, X, and B, for the Nazea pottery would seem to follow the general trend in art to become more stylized as society becomes more sophisticated. The two remaining vessels of the collection are classed as miscellaneous. Both show some evidence of Nazea influence. The first, pl. XLVI, A, no. 3, has a shape somewhat typical of the low bowls of style A, but the colors, if Nazca colors, are crude and do not show the usual Nazca vividness; the design is atypical. The other vessel, shown on pl. XLV, A, no. 3, has Nazca-like colors, a slightly modeled nose, and a mask over the mouth suggestive of the cat demon. From this examination of the collection of pottery at Florida State University it ap- pears that certain transformations took place in the Nazca culture with the passage of time. As an indication of the general cultural trend, the pottery changed its shape; the use of color became greater; the highly conventionalized demons of style B replaced the naturalistic birds and fish of style A. In no one phase of the development was there a decided break with the past; instead there was a gradual evolution, as shown by the overlapping of design elements and the similarity in the use of color between the periods. In marking the course of evolution, pottery, in a sense, marked the course of history. The intense abstraction of style B designs betrayed the sophistication of a declining culture. The decline is further in- dicated by the introduction of new design elements into the latter phases of the Nazca pot- tery.
