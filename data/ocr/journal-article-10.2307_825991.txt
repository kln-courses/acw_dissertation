You re- evaluated statements, inferred from silences, looked for loopholes and ambiguities. You did everything but take a statement at face value. So on one hand you believed nothing. And on the other, for the sake of logical consistency, and to preserve long-established rules, you would accept the most ridiculous fictions - that a corporation was a person, that an apartment tenant was renting land and not a dwelling....' Introduction The question of the 'true nature' of the corporate legal person and its personality has been one of the most troublesome and time-consuming questions ever pondered by philosophers, sociologists, economists, histo- rians, linguists, and jurists.2 Examinations of this problem have lead to radically different, and seemingly mutually exclusive, answers to this question. Once it is realized, however, that there are a multitude of dis- tinctive yet equally valid ways of looking at any phenomenon, the quest to find and defend 'the one true' answer becomes unnecessary. Instead, one comes to realize that there can be any number of 'true' answers so long as the dictates and fundamental assumptions of a given discipline are ad- hered to. Thus, it is consistent to say that, according to economics, there is no such thing as corporate personality since the 'true' nature of the corporation is a nexus of contracts,3 while also stating, that according to sociology or social philosophy, corporate personality is 'real' and reflects the will of the group.4 Likewise, one can make linguistic arguments to say that the use of the word 'person' to denote an inanimate patrimony5 is a 1 S. Thurow, One L (New York: Penguin, 1977) at 93. 2 Professor Wolff once argued that all continental legal scholars could be broken into one of two camps: those who had written about corporate personality and those that had not yet done so, M. Wolff, 'On the Nature of Legal Persons' (1938) 54 Law Q. Rev. 494 at 494. On the different theories of legal personality, see R.W.M. Dias, Jurisrudence, 5th ed. (London: Butterworths, 1985) at 253, ff. 3 While the literature using this paradigm is too vast to list, good summaries of this approach can be found in R. Romano, Foundations of Comporate Law (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997); B.R. Cheffins, Company Law: Theory, Structure and Operation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997). 4 See,for example, M.J.

Thus, it makes no imperialistic claims that its answers are the one 'truth' that trumps all an- swers reached in other disciplines. Its only claim will be that the answers provided form a coherent way to examine this issue from a legal perspec- tive. In order to reach this conclusion, the paper is divided into three main sections. In Part I, this paper will assert that Canadian corporate law is incoherent as a result of its organization around a separate legal person doctrine that: first is directly contradicted by the body of law dealing with piercing the corporate veil; and second fails to provide a unifying explanation of that which it claims to be an organizing principle. In Part II, this paper will show that the traditional formulation of a corporation as a legal person is also unnecessary. This will be accom- plished through the formulation of a 'private law model' corporation constructed with nothing more than the basic legal conceptions of natural persons, property, tort, contract, and unjust enrichment. It will be argued that this model is capable both of mimicking the most basic structural form of modern Canadian corporation statutes and of explain- 6 See Trustees of Dartmouth Collegev. Woodward, 17 U.S. 518 (1819) at 636 perMarshall C.J. ('A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.'). 7 See S.A. Schane, 'The Corporation Is A Person: The Language Of A Legal Fiction' (1987) 61 Tul. L. Rev. 563. 8 For example, the fiction theory correctly supposes that from an everyday linguistic point of view 'the short-hand formulation "corporate person" cannot be literally true.' D. Stevens, 'The Regulation of Takeovers and the Idea of the Corporation' [1994/95] Meredith Lectures 372 at 419 [hereinafter after 'Regulation']. It is not, however, a legal theory about the corporation, as this assertion tells us nothing about how the relationships and legal issues surrounding corporate law should be solved. Similarly, the realist version is also true - people do join together to form groups. These groups often take on an enduring 'culture' and when immersed in these groups people often behave differently as a result, see Schane, supra note 7 at 567. Yet, the realist version is 'legally irrelevant since the existence of a group identity says nothing about the legal form of the identity,' 'Regulation' at 419. What we are concerned with as lawyers is the principle of legal personality and its recognition as legal doctrine, not 'social, psychological, or erotic personality.' See B. Welling, Corprrate Law in Canada: The Governing Principles, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1991) at 80 [hereinafter Corporate Law].</page><page sequence="4">176 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL ing all the traditional attributes of the corporation, viz, limited liability, effective legal personality, perpetual existence, free transferability of shares, and separation of ownership and control.!" In Part III, this paper will then test the private law model of the corporation to see if it provides a more coherent way to understand difficult legal situations. The testing ground will be the quagmire of law that is formed by the veil-piercing cases. The argument of Part IV is that when the corporation is properly conceptualized, the riddle of the veil- piercing cases is easily solved as simply the proper application of com- mon law principles to the corporation. I Current doctrine is incoherent and confusing A. INCOHERENCE DEFINED In order to go about demonstrating that Canadian corporate law is incoherent and confusing, one must indicate in what sense the term 'incoherence' is being utilized. For the purpose of this paper, the following private law definition of coherence will be employed. Under this view, incoherence can manifest itself in two ways in any legal system. The first and most common manifestation occurs when two doctrines directly and logically contradict one another in one unified area of law. For example, tort law is incoherent in this sense so long as the principle that 'one is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable harm' is seen to be contradicted by non-recovery for 'pure' economic loss. While this is the primary form of incoherence, there is also a second manifestation. This more subtle form occurs when a self-appointed foundational principle fails to explain areas which are central to its experience and which by common understanding are to be included in that body of law. For example, a theoretical understanding of contract law would be incoher- ent, in this second sense, if it could not explain and integrate 'expecta- tion' damages into its overall justification of contract. In sum, to be coherent a body of law must consist of doctrines that 'exemplify a single theme' and constitute a unitary whole, rather than merely being 'an aggregate of conceptually disjunct or inconsistent elements that ... 9 These are an amalgam of the traditional attributes listed in P.L.

Rev. 80 at 89 [hereinafter 'Limited Liability'].</page><page sequence="5">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 177 happen to be juxtaposed.'"" The forthcoming argument will be that Canadian corporate law is incoherent because its organizing principle is both contradicted arbitrarily and fails to explain the totality of the law relating to corporations in a unified fashion. The next important task, especially to convince the pragmatic lawyer, is to answer the question: 'Our current understanding may be inelegant and technical, but it gets the job done in most cases, so what does it matter if corporate law is incoherent?' In other words, why does coher- ence matter? While one could write a whole manuscript addressing this question," a short answer would take the following form. If a body of law is coherent, one can readily determine and comprehend its structure and rules. One can identify the core form or principle, as well as: how this principle is applied in secondary doctrines; how these doctrines interre- late with one another; and how they are further refined into third level rules designed for specific circumstances." Thus, the quest for coherence forces one to formulate secondary doctrines and rules so that they are ultimately referable to that pre-eminent principle. In doing so, coher- ence renders the law both intelligible and accessible.13 Since a coherent system is intelligible, people can also be reasonably sure when their actions will contravene the law, make plausible arguments on how the law should develop to meet future demands, and thereby structure their relations with others in a more certain fashion. Thus, coherence also provides predictive value. Beyond these virtues, coherence also serves to justify the operation of law with the public. Since rules are coherently related to 'principle' (and courts justify their decisions in written judge- ments for all to see), persons involved in disputes can see that a decision was rendered for legal reasons and not because of sympathy, political expedience, subjective moral assumption, or arbitrary mechanism (e.g., flipping a coin in despair)." Thus, coherence has justificatory value and demonstrates that the state's imposition of coercion is justified on some 10 E.J. Weinrib, 'Legal Formalism: On the Immanent Rationality of the Law' (1988) 97 Yale L.J. 949 at 968-9. 11 See E.J. Weinrib, The Idea ofPrivate Law (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995) [hereinafter Private Law]. 12 This is largely the structure of the C.C.Q., Book Five, which starts with an organizing principle of Obligations, then proceeds to define its manifestations in Contract, Civil Responsibility, and Unjustified Enrichment; how these doctrines relate to one another; and then finally the special rules for Nominate Contracts and Torts. 13 For evidence, compare the organization, language, and length of the C.C.Q., which regulates all of private law with the Companies Act (U.K.), 1985, c. 6. [hereinafter U.K.C.A.], which attempts to regulate only corporations. 14 D.

Finally, because the quest for coherence takes principle, intelligibility, and the process of justification seriously, it helps to ensure that there is an internal change mechanism within the law itself. Thus, even on an internal understanding of the law, we can legitimately argue that some cases or doctrines are wrong - even ancient rules that 'have spawned extensive and ramified jurisprudence' - because they 'do not adequately reflect' the higher principle to which they are said to cohere.'" Thus, coherence ensures that working within the law does not come to equal accepting 'the entire corpus of holdings as if they were facts of nature.'"' Coherence, therefore, also has a corrective value. The true virtues of coherence, however, are more readily demonstrated when it is absent from a legal system. Without coherence, a body of law becomes increasingly technical and confusing as it retreats into conventionalism and arbitrary distinction to justify the increasingly disparate holdings of the cases. With this disso- nance, the lawyer can no longer properly advise his or her clients as to the probable outcome of litigation or how to order their affairs. Thus, 'testing' litigation increases, as do claims of malpractice or misrepresenta- tion.Judges exasperated with the increasing complexity and incoherence of the cases either come to strange conclusions that run counter to intuition but conform to the 'law' as conventionally understood it;17 reinterpret clear language with statements like 'although the law says x, it really means Y or sometimes Z';18 or resort to 'policy,' 'Equity' or overtly historicist" arguments tojustify a remedy given to those whom they think are deserving.2" Soon litigants, litigators, and commentators lose faith in that body of law's ability to properlyjustify its outcomes, often retreating into other disciplines for understanding.21 Then, finally, because the law shows no sign of correcting itself, legislation is passed to remedy the worst failings of the system, often by giving the judiciary even wider remedies designed to do 'justice' in the circumstances.22 Unfortunately, 15 Private Law, supra note 11 at 13. 16 Ibid. at 13. 17 See the discussion of poison pills surrounding note 65, below. 18 See discussion of 'best interests of the corporation' surrounding note 58, below. 19 This is the view that a rule can be set aside without an examination of its merits merely because it was historically conditioned; for example, that the doctrine of consideration should be rejected because it is said to represent a nineteenth-century laisser faire mentality. 20 See discussion of the 'corporate approach' tort cases in Part III (E), which are said to protect the policy of limited liability. 21 Such as the hugely popular 'law and economics' approach. 22 For example, the Canadian oppression remedy: 'the broadest, most comprehensive and most open-ended shareholder remedy in the common law world. It is unprecedented</page><page sequence="7">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 179 as the pragmatic lawyer will have realized, this state of affairs largely describes the present state of Canadian corporate law. What he or she might not have realized is that much of this discord is directly attribut- able to corporate law's incoherence, rather than to its increasing com- plexity. Thus, when coherence is removed from the law, one can more readily see why its absence should concern the pragmatic lawyer as much as it does the academic. B. THE FAILINGS OF PRESENT DOCTRINE Open any major corporate law textbook and one will be inundated with claims to the effect that the principle recognized in Salomon v. A. Salomon &amp; Co. Ltd.,2 and codified in the Canadian Business Corporations Act, s. 15(1)24 - that the corporation is a legal person distinct from its share- holders, directors, and any other legal person - is the central and foundational principal of corporate law.25 Furthermore, that this princi- ple is justified, necessary, and should continue to form such a basis is rarely questioned.2" As Lord Templeman claims, it is the 'unyielding rock'27 on which corporate law is constructed.28 While this traditional 'black letter' approach has survived for more than 100 years, it 'is unwise, however, to infer success from survival. What is more important is that the principle can be shown ... to be inherently sound.'2 " This is preciously where the problem with corporate personality lies for an examination of this principle reveals that it renders Canadian corporate law incoherent. Clearly, Canadian corporate law is incoherent in the first sense due to the fact that the separate entity principle is directly contradicted by other in its scope.' See 820099 Ontario Inc. v.

For evidence of this, one need simply examine any judgement where sharp practice is alleged or any major scholarly work on the subject. No sooner has it been stated that the corporation is a legal person distinct from its shareholders than courts and academic writers allow that legal personality should some- times be disregarded.30 How can the 'legal person doctrine' that is so central to corporate law in one sentence be disregarded so casually in the next? Both propositions cannot be true. Something cannot both 'be' and 'not be.' This 'very singular contradiction' is logically impossible."' As Lord Halsbury claimed in Salomon's case itself: 'Either a limited company was a legal entity or it was not.'32 Until this contradiction at the heart of corporate law is explained in some principled fashion, or reliance upon the legal person doctrine is discontinued, Canadian corporate law will remain radically incoherent. This area of conflict and incoherence becomes even more problem- atic when the veil-piercing doctrines are examined more closely. Such scrutiny reveals that the body of doctrine that threatens the coherence of corporate law is itself far from coherent. The first sign of this is that there is very little agreement as to what, in fact, constitutes piercing the corporate veil.33 Is looking at the actions of shareholders in a corporation veil-piercing? Some argue yes,34 others no.35 Is looking at the actions of directors veil-piercing? Again, similar yes"6 and no answers.37 The second problematic sign is that there is no agreement as to either the number of categories allowing the courts to pierce the corporate veil; the doctrinal requirements necessary for each of the categories; or which cases exem- 30 The phenomenon is so widespread that one hesitates to cite anyone in particular, but see Nedco Ltd. v.

Cases are decided by judges who adopt different attitudes to the question and rarely, if ever, state what their general theory of corporate personality is.'" Despite this prob- lem, some of the many 'principled categories' often put forward in- clude40 agency, fraud or mere facade, group enterprise, trusts, interpreta- tion of contracts, tort, enemy legislation, tax legislation, disrespect of corporate formalities, other legislation, non-arm's-length parent-subsid- iary relations, and undercapitalization. Looking at the list, one comes to the conclusion that there is really nothing coherent about the categories. Rather, they merely categorize the circumstances surrounding when the veil is lifted, as opposed to exemplifying a principled basis from which the courts derive authority to pierce the veil. If it is indeed the former, these lists are of little use to the judge or legal scholar. Looking more deeply at the categories, one wonders why some of them are even included. For example, what does agency have to do with veil-piercing? Although agency, as currently applied, has the same effect as veil-piercing - viz, holding shareholders or directors liable for the debts of the corporation - it is arguably not a real violation of the separate entity principle.41 Rather, it is a reaffirmation of that principle because it allows that one legal person, a corporation, may be the agent of another legal person, just as a natural person might. Yet, this category is to be found under the veil-piercing category in many works on the 38 Pickering, supra note 33 at 483; A.

This disagreement no doubt stems from the case law on the subject, which confuses, mangles, and intermixes legal agency, factual control, lack of separate will (could one say puppetness?) and veil-piercing into one unrecognizable whole, see for example, Toronto (City of) v.

Or do these provisions, as express components of the legislative framework applicable to corporations actually 'define the corporate veil rather than pierce it'?44 Beyond the disagreements over the statutory and agency categories, what can be said of the others? Is there something more beyond the datum that the corporate veil should be pierced when not to do so 'would yield a result "too flagrantly opposed to justice"?'45 Most commen- tators think not. Farrar, for example, has argued: 'there is no common unifying principle, which underlies the occasional decisions of the courts to pierce the corporate veil.'46 The Supreme Court of Canada has stated as much. Justice Wilson argued in Constitution Insurance Co. of Canada v. Kosmopoulos, for instance, that the courts have followed 'no consistent principle' when piercing the corporate veil.47 Thus, even our courts recognize that these residual categories are not principled and coherent interventions but rather instances of ad hoc judicial discretion." While many recognize the need for change and coherence in this area,49 others are content to leave well enough alone so as not to hinder the court's flexibility,50 or insist that such a rationalization is impossible.51 This state of affairs would be almost comical if the proper interpreta- tion of the veil-piercing cases were not so important to our understand- ing of corporate law. To reiterate, statute and precedent posits that the corporation is a separate legal person. Courts and corporate law theorists 42 Ottolenghi, supra note 34 at 345.

This central principle is then immediately contradicted when the sepa- rate legal existence of the corporation is denied by the courts, albeit in 'exceptional' circumstances. When the court is asked to justify this intervention, its only response seems to be because 'the situation de- mands' or 'I feel like it.' This state of affairs is unacceptable in such a developed legal system and smacks of arbitrary justice, rather than of the rational application of coherent legal rules to difficult factual circum- stances.52 As one author has noted, the present casuistic approach, 'even if permissible, cannot satisfy those who believe that a legal system should be built, as far as possible, on a foundation of principle.'53 Until this whole area of law is reformed, or interpreted as complimentary to the separate legal entity principle, Canadian corporate law will remain radically incoherent. Furthermore, this interaction with the veil-piercing cases shows the legal person doctrine as a weak cornerstone on which to build our corporate law edifice. Upon closer examination, Canadian corporate law is also incoherent in the second sense as its foundational principle fails to explain the totality of company law. Clearly, the 'legal person' doctrine has done, and continues to do some explanatory work. It goes a long way toward superficially illustrating many of the traditional attributes of the corpora- tion, such as legal personality, limited liability, and perpetual succession. Furthermore, the legal person doctrine can also be marshalled to explain to whom the directors owe their duties and in tandem with Equity, the scope of that duty. Thus, at first glance, a pragmatist can argue that many of corporate law's basic principles are seemingly explained with the idea that a corporation is a distinct legal person. Yet, if the logic of these assertions is probed a little deeper it can be seen that the legal person doctrine does less explaining than was origi- nally thought. Take, for example, the limited liability of shareholders. As Professor Farrar explains, the mere fact that the law recognizes a separate legal person does not necessarily mean that limited liability is created as a matter of logic.54 Under English law, a company with a separate legal 52 This is a paraphrase of L.C.B.

While one can argue that such a state of affairs is a 'leftover' from a system which has a statutory contract at its base, it does help to show that limited liability and separate legal personality are not conceptually linked as strongly as has been claimed. While the link between limited liability and 'legal person' is perhaps only a minor explanatory inconsistency of present doctrine, its response to directors' duties is a more glaring failure. As mentioned above, the legal person metaphor posits that since the corporation is a separate legal person, and director's fiduciaries, a director's duty must be something similar to the command of the C.B.C.A. to 'act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation.'56 Of course there are obvious difficulties of interpretation: Are there three elements to the duty or less? If there are three, what does 'good faith' add to 'honestly' and 'best interests'? Or conversely, do all these words characterize the same quality of motive required of the directors?57 But beyond these types of questions, there is the underlying problem of acting in the 'best interests' of a legal person. What does this really mean? As Professor D.D. Prentice has argued, the term 'best inter- ests' is 'one of the most problematic in company law,' 'often indetermi- nate' and 'arguably incoherent.'58 The problem in this area of the law stems from attempting to read too much into the metaphor of 'legal person.' As has been noted byjudges and commentators, since a corpora- tion is 'incapable of loyalty, or enmity, or residence, or of anything but bare existence in contemplation of law,'"5 a 'requirement to benefit an artificial entity ... would be irrational and futile, since a non-real entity is incapable of experiencing well-being.'"" If the 'legal person' metaphor is replaced by the names of the underlying assets residing in the corporate patrimony this point becomes clearer. What 'interests' does a bank account or trade goods (e.g., tennis rackets) have apart from the people who utilize them for the fulfilment of their own purposes and interests? The answer is 'none,' since only natural persons have interests; creations 55 U.K.C.A., s. 1(2) (c), supra note 13. 56 See s.122 (1) (a); O.B.C.A., s. 34(1). 57 'Regulation', supra note 8 at 457. 58 D.D.

Thus, trying to figure out what the corporation wants to do, or what is in its 'best interests,' is like trying to deduce its sexual orientation - an impossible task."2 'As we have no rational way of discerning the answer, asking the question is not a fruitful exercise.'63 But given the clear statutory pronouncement and long case history, the law attempts to discern an impossible answer, usually in one of two forms. The first method is to ignore the conceptual difficulties of 'best interests' and push ahead with solving cases as ifa patrimony was totally analogous to a human being.64 Perhaps, the clearest example of this type of misguided reasoning occurs in the context of hostile takeovers. Here, an offer by one person for the personal property of another"5 - that is, their shares of a company - turns into an attack on the existence of the company and thus its interest in its continued 'life,' 'integrity,' and 'personality.'"6 In order to protect these 'ultimate interests,' common law doctrine posits that the board of directors has the power to protect the corporation from this 'attack.' Thus, in 347883 Alberta Inc. v. Producers Pipeline Inc.,67 the court stated that 'defensive measures' by the board are permissible so long as the directors (a) in good faith perceived a threat to the corporation, (b) acted after a proper investigation, and (c) employed means that were reasonable in relation to the threat posed by the takeover.68 But once the possibility of corporations having moral person- ality and ultimate interests is denied, as it should be, the argument that a takeover should be defended on these grounds becomes unsustainable. If corporations do not have interests, they cannot have a continued interest 61 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 457. Support for this proposition also comes from both traditional and reform minded commentators, compare H.G. Manne, 'The Limits and Rationale of Corporate Altruism: An Individualistic Model' (1973) 59 Va. L. Rev. 708 at 710 ('only individuals, not corporations, have interests') with C.

The ultimate irony, then, is that in its haste to safeguard the non-existent interests of the legal person from attack, the law arguably encourages a board of directors to violate the real rights that shareholders of the same class have to equal treatment."' While the analogy to the human personality is ultimately flawed, the next solution often employed is to try to discern who the corporation 'really' is and, therefore, to whom the directors' fiduciary duties are 'really' owed.7" As Parkinson has argued, since the corporation is a vehicle for natural persons to realize their interests, one only has to locate the proper groups meant to be benefited in order to answer the duty question.71 The trouble with this process is that because corporate law is inadequately conceptualized, the term 'corporation' can be interpreted to mean virtually anything. Therefore, one can reasonably argue that the directors' fiduciary duties are owed to the majority,72 the totality of the shareholders,73 creditors,74 employees,75 or the community at large.7" Thus, corporate law is engulfed in a stakeholder's debate,77 and corporate law doctrine, both in and out of the courtroom, is thrown into a 'crisis'78 with no solution. Without a proper legal theory of the corpora- tion one will never know who or what the corporation really is, nor the content and scope of the directors' duties. Therefore, these debates and 69 See F.H. Buckley, et al., Corporations: Principles and Policies (Toronto: Emond Montgomery Publications, 1995) at 1094; L.E.

Rev. 1373-723.</page><page sequence="15">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 187 arguments show the limited usefulness of the present 'legal person' doctrine to adequately explain the nature and scope of directors' fidu- ciary duties. Thus, in regard to directors' duties and limited liability, the contribution of the 'separate legal existence' doctrine is more meagre than otherwise believed. Beyond these problems, the 'legal person' metaphor also fails to explain or justify corporate law's most important modern innovations and perennial problems. Examples of these deficiencies abound. Thus, while the separate existence of the corporation explains why the share- holders are not said to own the corporate patrimony, it does little to explain the nature of a shareholder's interest and the nature of the share. Since the rights and duties that 'attach to a share' are in doubt, so is their free transferability, as well as the nature of the duties that share- holders might owe to one another. In other words, the legal person doctrine cannot answer the question of whether there are fiduciary duties between shareholders.7" Another deficiency of this doctrine has to do with its inability to explain the circumstances in which shareholders will be allowed to bring derivative actions. If directors' duties are owed to the corporation, then why are minority shareholders ever allowed to bring an action under the rule in Foss v. Harbottle?8o If the legal person doctrine is so central, why was this limiting rule amended under the new statutory system so that there are wide remedies for minority sharehold- ers such as subsidized derivative actions or compliance orders?8' Further- more, what does the legal person doctrine tell us about the use of the oppression remedy or about the separation of ownership and control?82 The answer is that it tells us little or nothing. In order for our corporate law to be coherent, its central principle must be able to explain and interrelate both the internal and external rules of corporate personality and corporate governance. Instead, Canadian corporate law, as presently formulated, provides us with a 'basic' principle that incompletely ex- plains some aspects of the law, with its worst failings amended and ameliorated by a large statutory contribution. This statutory 'improve- ment' most often takes the form of an extraordinary amount of discre- tion that permits adjudicators to deal with complicated issues 'on an im- pressionistic and ad hoc basis.'8" Clearly, this state of affairs is unaccept- 79 Compare Brant Investments Ltd. v.

The truth is that although the law aspires to coherence, the best conceptualization of Canadian corporate law presents itself as little more than an amalgam of warring principles and themes, including majority rule, minority protection, shareholders' rights, corporate personality, and managerial power.85 While this realization is important in demonstrating that the legal person doctrine is not as central as is currently thought, it does little to show that the law is coherent. To do that would require one to demonstrate how each principle interrelates and amplifies the other as part of an interrelated whole, rather than being merely 'isolated -and unrelated emanations of state power.'86 Such a task would require the theorist to show how minority protection flows naturally from majority rule, rather than being an arbitrary limit on either majority rule or managerial power.87 Likewise, one would have to show how our under- standing of corporate personality is enhanced by the veil-piercing cases rather than being merely confused or contradicted by them. Given the enormity of the task, I doubt whether this can ever be accomplished accepting all the current paradigms and principles of Canadian corpo- rate law at face value. As Professor Davies contends, if one looks at the major developments this century and the problems that these have thrown up, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there has been a reluctance to recognise their implications for company law and that, when those implications have been recognised, the reaction has been to add to the existing framework without ever re-examining its foundations to ensure that they are sufficiently sound to bear the weight of the expanding superstructure.88 In response to this problem, this paper will offer a new theory of the corporation - a fundamental principle - that unifies these disparate elements and which might, consequently, prove 'sufficiently sound' to support our corporate law edifice and render it coherent. This model, however, is not meant to be descriptive of the current justifications for corporate law rules and it does not replicate the current thinking of 84 B.

It may thus appear counter-intuitive to many stepped in the current paradigm. Hopefully, if the pragmatic lawyer can suspend his or her disbelief for long enough, he or she will see the poten- tial for this conceptualization of the corporation to solve many of com- pany law's intractable problems and inconsistencies. II A private law model of the corporation In this section I will outline and supplement a private law model of the corporation that was first enunciated by Professor David Stevens in a lecture entitled 'The Regulation of Takeovers and the Idea of the Corpo- ration.'8" According to this theory, all the traditional attributes of the corporation - limited liability, perpetual existence, effective legal person- ality, separation of ownership and control, and free transferability of shares- are all seen as the outcome of contracts between natural persons.90 Thus, following in the tradition of Hohfeld, this section will posit that all rights and duties that comprise a corporation are ultimately reducible to statements of law concerning natural persons."' Following the economic literature of the agency cost theorists, the private law model argues that the core principle of company law is that a corporation is a 'nexus' of jural relations between the various players involved in its creation."'2 This nexus forms what in the civilian tradition would be termed a 'special' or 'nominate' contract containing central provisions that have been standardized through usage and over time."! The argument in this section is that the central characteristics of this contract are two-fold: a relationship of non-agency amongst the shareholders and between shareholders and directors, and a promise by 89 See 'Regulation,' supra note 8. 90 Ibid. at 420. 91 W.N. Hohfeld, 'Nature of Stockholders' Individual Liability for Corporate Debts' (1909) 9 Colum. L. Rev. 285 at 289 ('a corporation is just an association of natural persons conducting business under legal forms, methods, and procedures that are sui generis' and when we say that a so-called legal person has rights or that it has contracted, in reality we mean nothing more than what can ultimately be explained by describing the capacities, rights, privileges, disabilities, duties, liabilities, and so on, of the natural persons concerned). 92 For more on the agency cost theory see, Romano, supra note 3. For the differences between this model and other contractual models of the corporations please see Part II (E) (3), below. 93 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 420. See also Farrar's, supra note 40 at 7; F.H. Easterbrook &amp; D.R. Fischel, 'The Corporate Contract' (1989) Colum. L. Rev. 1416 at 1444-5 (corporate law is a kind of standard form contract). Unfortunately, while this idea is prominent in economic literature and the civilian tradition, the idea of nominate contracts is not as far developed in the common law.</page><page sequence="18">190 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL the directors to manage the corporate patrimony with care and loyalty so as to maximise its net present value. In order to find evidence of the characteristics of the corporation, this paper will look to the modern corporations statutes,"4judicial precedent, and doctrinal writing on the subject. Furthermore, where there are gaps or inconsistencies, this paper will look to the next closest legal institution in the common law, that of the Trust,!'5 rather than to the contract of partnership (which has been the traditional analogy used by common- wealth judges to solve difficult problems of interpretation). Thus, while the private law model is innovative, it is not as radical as would first appear. All of its answers to the difficult doctrinal questions do not 'appear from midair' or from an external functional approach but rather are grounded in, and evidenced by, what we as lawyers and jurists have already committed ourselves to, at least by necessary implication. Many things remain implicit, however, because 'the corporation' is a compara- tively young phenomenon by legal standards; the mere 100 years since Salomon v. Salomon is not nearly enough time for the common law 'to work itself pure.'" One word of caution is required, however, before the examination begins. This section does not claim to answer all of corporate law's questions and doctrinal difficulties. Instead it aims to construct a legal foundation with which judges and legal academics may clearly and concisely answer the questions posed by especially vexing areas, such as the veil-piercing cases or claims of shareholder oppression. With that explained, an examination of the interrelation of the private law model with basic attributes of the corporation can begin. 94 For example, C.B.C.A. and O.B.C.A. Under the private law model the legislator's participation will be viewed as an effort, however unsuccessful, to enact in the style of a civil code (i.e., delineating the central and suppletive terms of a legal form), rather than in the traditional common law style of case law codification and amelioration. 95 This analogy has often been hinted at, see Guinness plc. v. Saunders, [1990] 2 A.C. 663 (H.L.) per Goff &amp; Templeman LJJ. (articles of association are similar to a trust instrument or deed). See also H. Hansmann &amp; U. Mattei, 'The Functions of Trust Law: A Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis' (1998) 73 N.Y.U.L.R. 434 at 438 ('the partitioning of assets among creditors that is provided by trust law is much the same as that provided by a business corporation'). 96 Omychund v. Barker (1745), 1 Atk. 21 (L.C.). Western legal systems have been working on the core legal conceptions of contract and civil responsibility for well over a thousand years and there is still much debate over many fundamental issues in these areas. It would therefore be pure arrogance to assume that corporate law could accomplish this complex task in less than one-tenth of the time.</page><page sequence="19">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 191 A. LIMITED LIABILITY Of the five attributes of the modern corporation the private law model posits that limited liability is the most central.'" This interpretation as to the centrality of limited liability is generally shared by the vast body of economic literature on the subject of corporate law'~8 and by some traditional-minded theorists."` In the context of the private law model, limited liability means that only the corporate patrimony is legally answerable to pay for obligations incurred by the participants in the corporate contract and that neither the shareholders, directors, or employees should therefore be liable for these debts.'l Due to the centrality of this concept it is argued that any theory of the corporation should be judged on the basis of whether or not 'it provides a coherent and accurate account of limited liability.'""1 As a result the task is to construct limited liability out of the jural relations between natural persons, which can be done in the following manner. 1. The Shareholder Contract ('S' Contract) The first of these relationships is the contract between the original shareholders. By means of this contract the shareholders establish and dedicate a group of assets to become the corporate patrimony. These shareholders mutually agree to retain an undivided residual claim to what they have dedicated - 'a share' - but no direct right of ownership nor extensive power of administration.'"2 Instead, the shareholders agree to appoint administrators, the directors, to manage the patrimony in pursuit of a defined business.'03 The 's' contract further stipulates that the shareholders are not agents of one another and cannot therefore be liable, qua shareholder, for each other's obligations."'4 Therefore, this is 97 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 420. 98 Yet while asserting the centrality of the concept generally some economic literature finds the rule inefficient, see for example, P. Halpern, M. Trebilcock &amp; M. Turnbull, 'An Economic Analysis of Limited Liability in Corporate Law' (1980) 30 U.T.L.J. 117. 99 See J.S. Zeigel, 'Is Incorporation (with Limited Liability) Too Easily Available' (1990) 31 Les Cahiers de Droit 1075 at 1080 ('limited liability is undoubtedly the most important and common reason why lawyers recommend incorporation'); Thompson, supra note 52 at 6. 100 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 420. 101 Ibid. at 420. 102 Thus, as in A.-G. R?ference (No. 2 of 1982), [1984] Q.B. 624 (C.A.) the shareholders could steal from themselves because they have only an undivided shared interest in the whole patrimony (assets and liabilities). 103 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 420-21. 104 Ibid. at 421.</page><page sequence="20">192 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL not a contract of partnership, and the shareholders are not 'mutual- agents.'"05 Since shareholders are not mutual-agents and not generally mutual-fiduciaries,'06 they have no legal interest in the identity of the other shareholders. Taken to its logical conclusion, since the identity of any shareholder is legally irrelevant, the rights and duties of a share could not be dependent upon its holder.'07 In other words, all shares of a class are equal in all respects, and since the share is the only nexus between the shareholder and the corporate patrimony, all shareholders who own shares of a class are equal in that respect as well.'"0 Thus, they are equal with respect to both their rights to vote for management and fundamental changes (i.e., governance rights) and their rights to share in distributions from the corporate patrimony.'" Furthermore, since the identity of the owner is immaterial, a share is simply a fungible piece of personal property that can be bought or sold at the owner's conve- nience."0 Thus, through the 's' contract and its necessary implications one finds many answers as to nature of the share. In addition, the 's' contract would include provisions dealing with the internal make-up, voting procedures, quorum requirements, majorities for fundamental change, and other necessary provisions."' 2. The Directors' Contract ('D' Contract) The second relationship that establishes limited liability is the contract between the directors and the totality of shareholders."2 Through this contract, directors are appointed by the shareholders and promise to look only to the newly established corporate patrimony for fulfilment of 105 Ibid. at 421.This position of non-agency is similar to the position of beneficiaries under a trust who are not generally mutual agents, see D.J. Hayton, Hayton and Marshall: Commentary and Cases on the Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies, 10th ed.

(one can vote shares in one's own interest). If the corporation is properly conceptualized, the imposition of such duties is unnecessary. The cases where they have been imposed could be dealt with through the proper application of the 'D' contract, re-examine Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien, 280 A. 2d 717 (Del.

Instead of the traditional formulation of director's duties, which is confusing and incoherent, the directors promise to manage the patrimony with care and loyalty so as to maximise its net present value ('NPV');"3 and to respect any other terms of the 's' contract."114 The directors are thus empowered accordingly, with each fiduciary power containing its own limits and with each promise limiting the other.""5 Thus, for example, the 'D' contract gives full power to the directors to 'incur civil obligations for which the corporate patrimony alone is charged or benefited' so long as this is done to maximize the NPV of the corporate patrimony."" While this is the primary limit, the 'D' contract shows that directors may also breach their duties by contraven- ing the terms of the 's' contract (such as the right of shareholders to equal treatment)."' As with the contract between the shareholders, the 'D' contract is also a contract of 'non-agency,' stating that the directors are neither agents of each other, nor agents of the shareholders or promoters."118 Instead, the directors have the legal power to bind only themselves and the corporate patrimony. Therefore, any contractual or delictual obligation legally obliges/benefits only that director and the corporate patrimony. It is also in the 'D' contract that the directors are given a promise of indemnity from the corporate patrimony for any expenses incurred in its administration."9 113 For evidence of the centrality of this power, see C.B.C.A., supra note 24 at ss.102(1), s.122(3); O.B.C.A., supra note 24 at ss. 115(1), s.134(3); Automatic Self Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co. v. Cunninghame, [1906] 2 Ch. 34 (C.A.). Of course, in performing this promise, the directors must comply with all aspects of the general law, see M. Friedman, 'A Friedman Doctrine - The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits' The New York Times (13 September 1970) 33. 114 In the 'D' contract, the directors would also be given the power to make distributions to the shareholders from time to time, to initiate fundamental and constitutional changes, and to oversee the corporate democracy. A review of the exact limitations of these powers and their interrelationship with one another is, however, beyond the scope of this inquiry. 115 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 459, Howard, supra note 65. 116 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 421. 117 Ibid. at 459; 'Takeover,' supra note 69. See also Gambotto, supra note 110 (Company's 'best interests' invalid reason for the expropriation of the minority shares). 118 While this concept of 'non-agency' may seem strange at first it also has a counterpart under traditional Trust doctrine where the Trustee is neither the agent of the Beneficiaries nor the Settlor, see Hayton, supra note 105 at 120, 755. See also Clark, supra note 9 at s.1.2.4 (22), where he states that the relationship between director and shareholders is not one of legal agency. 119 See C.B.C.A., supra note 24 at s.124; OB.C.A., supra note 24 at s. 136. This is also in keeping with Trust doctrine, which gives the Trustee a right of indemnity against the trust fund to compensate her for any liabilities properly incurred, see Blundell v. Blundel, (1888) 40 Ch. D. 370; Hayton, supra note 105 at 6 &amp; 751-5.</page><page sequence="22">194 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL In combination, both the 's' and 'D' contracts contain all of the elements necessary to establish a corporation. For the sake of conceptual certainty the contracts are entered into simultaneously through a certificate of incorporation that establishes the shares, the shareholders, the corporate patrimony, and those who are to administer it.120 With the 's' and 'D' contract in place, we can go on to examine how limited liability works with respect to both contract and tort creditors of the corporate patrimony. 3. The Position of Contractual Creditors of the Corporate Patrimony Limited liability with respect to contract creditors is relatively easily explained. Outside creditors of the corporation make 'non-recourse' contracts with the directors, or others authorized by the directors, to charge or benefit the corporate patrimony.'21 These contracts provide that the creditor will look solely to the corporate patrimony for fulfilment of the obligation and for damages for breach of that obligation. Thus, neither the director,"22 shareholders, nor any other 'corporate agent'123 will be charged with the burden or benefit of the contract.'24 In general terms, this limited or non-recourse promise can be properly inferred where any creditor knowingly contracts with an agent/employee of a company displaying 'Ltd.' or some similar abbreviation.'25 In other words, when a corporate agent signs on behalf of 'x Corp.' the reality is that they have agreed that the corporate patrimony is to be bound in return for a promise by the creditor that the creditor will execute only against that patrimony if the relevant promise is breached. 120 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 421. 121 Ibid. at 422; 'Limited Liability,' supra note 9 at 112. 122 This is the situation with the trustee, who is liable for all the debts of the Trust unless she has made it clear that the creditor of the obligation has recourse only to Trust corpus, see Lumsden v. Buchanan (1865), 4 Macq. 950 (H.L.). 123 Of course, the use of the term 'corporate agent' is a metaphor since only a natural person can be a principal. This metaphor, however, accurately describes the effect of the 'D' and 'S' contracts.'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 422. Furthermore, if necessary, the metaphor can be unpacked in the following manner. The corporate agent is, in fact, an employee of the directors who is capable of binding only the corporate patrimony and has promised to look only to the corporate patrimony for any indemnity. Likewise, a director can be classified as a corporate agent because of her right of indemnity bargained for in the 'D' contract. 124 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 422. As F.H. Lawson, A Common Lawyer Looks at the Civil Law (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1953) at 200 argues: 'What is a modern limited company ... but a device for limiting the access of creditors to a single fund?' For an analysis of the corporation as a fund, see Ford supra note 9 at 19-21. 125 On statutorily permitted abbreviations, see C.B.C.A., supra note 24 at s. 10; O.B.C.A., supra note 24 at s. 10. For more on this point, see discussion in Part III (E) on corporate tort, below.</page><page sequence="23">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 195 For many, this 'director/non-recourse contract' analysis may seem counter-intuitive, especially in regards to the enforcement of claims when directors have retired, died, or been removed from office. Thus one might ask, 'Why can the creditor enforce his or her claim on the corpo- rate patrimony when their co-contractee has been removed from the picture?' In all of these cases, the contract creditor is protected because he or she has purchased a claim in the corporate patrimony in the form: 'If promise not performed, fund will indemnify.' Since the directors have the power to bind the corporate patrimony in this way, the indemnity can be said to follow the fund,'26 which thereby eliminates any problems that a pragmatic lawyer would have regarding personal contracts and a shifting board of directors. Conceptually, the process is no different than enforcing an easement - if a former promise is not performed, one need only compel the current administrators of the property (i.e., directors of the corporate patrimony) to take all actions that are necessary to respect the claims that follow the property (i.e., release the funds required to fulfil the creditor's right to indemnity). Interestingly, this combination of an action for compliance with subsequent satisfaction only from patrimo- nial property makes it seem as if the plaintiff had sued the company directly and accounts for the law's current 'procedural step' that allows for this possibility. Thus, non-concensual through simple contractual relationships we have established the limited liability of shareholders, directors, and corporate agents from the contractual debts of the 'corpo- ration' and justified the ability of a contract creditor to execute judge- ments in his or her favour directly against the corporate patrimony. 4. The Position of Tort Creditors of the Corporate Patrimony While limited liability with respect to contract creditors is fairly easily demonstrated, the task is generally seen as much more difficult with respect to tort creditors.127 Tort creditors are, for the most part,'28 non- consensual claimants and there is a sense that there is something unjust in the current formulation of the law that does not allow these non- consensual creditors recourse beyond the corporate patrimony.'29 126 This also conforms with Trust doctrine that allows a trustee to create a charge whereby only trust property is pledged for payment of a debt, see Hayton, supra note 105 at 755. 127 See R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law, 3d ed. (Boston: Little Brown, 1986) at 372 (economic nexus of contract theory 'breaks down' with respect to tort creditors). Limited liability for tort is then defended on policy grounds, see D. R. Fischel, 'The Corporate Governance Movement' (1982) 35 Vand. L. Rev. 1259 at 1274 (it is best understood as a subsidy to encourage efficient private conduct). 128 That is, barring concurrent claims in contract and negligent misrepresentation. 129 See, .for example, H. Hansmann &amp; R. Kraakman, 'Toward Unlimited Shareholder Liability for Corporate Torts' (1991) 100 Yale L.J. 1879.</page><page sequence="24">196 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL Likewise, others have argued that the current regime of limited liability is a privilege that protects shareholders from the vicarious liability that tort would otherwise impose on them for the acts of their agents or employ- ees.'30 The argument of this section will be that this type of limited liability is not a privilege but is rather eminentlyjustified on general legal principle. Before moving ahead with this analysis, however, it is necessary to clear up a few misconceptions that might hinder the discussion. The first of these has to do with the primary liability of an agent, employee, or director for their own fault or negligence. Is there a blanket immunity for these corporate actors for their own fault?''31 The answer of both the private law model and the positive law is that corporate limited liability will not absolve any natural person of liability for their tortious acts.'"' Thus, non-consensual tort creditors will always have recourse to a tortfeasor's pocketbook for satisfaction of their claims. The second of these misconceptions has to do with the belief that the company can be primarily and personally liable for 'its' own torts.'33 When the private law model is used one sees that this type of claim cannot exist at private law. The corporate patrimony is merely a fund, and since only a statutory intervention can deem an inanimate object to act all private law claims against the corporate patrimony must be vicarious."13 With these condi- tions in mind, the purpose of the following discussion will be two-fold: it will provide a justification for the limited liability of shareholders, directors, and other employees/agents from vicarious claims of liability; and it will demonstrate how a fund, the corporate patrimony, can be said to be vicarious liability for the actions of a natural person. This process of formulating 'justifications,' however, is made all the more difficult because the common law gives no formal or principled 130 Goddard, supra note 35 at 37; B.

Instead, the major theorists (once again) offer a 'hodgepodge' approach of 'reasons,' such as control, master's benefit, revenge, care and choice, identification, evidence, indulgence, danger, deterrence, satisfaction of claims, and loss distribution."35 When these so-called legal reasons are examined, how- ever, one finds that there are not any particularly convincing legal explanations. As Professor Fleming argues: 'Despite the frequent invoca- tion of such tired tags as "respondeat superior" or "qui facit per alium facit per se," the modern doctrine of vicarious liability cannot parade as a deduction from legalistic principles, but should be frankly recognised as having its basis in a combination of policy considerations.'"" The prob- lem with this policy analysis approach is that no one is actually sure which policies are forwarded by the doctrine and none of the proposed policy reasons, on their own, seem to 'justify the scope of the doctrine of vicarious liability.'"37 Despite the inadequacy of the common law it is suggested that there is in fact a formal and principled legal justification for the doctrine of vicarious liability based upon the link with agent/employee indemnifica- tion. Under this theory, the ultimate responsibility of any principal for the acts of his agent/employee stems from the principal's promise to indemnify these parties for harms incurred in the course of their employ- ment.'38 The vicarious claim by the plaintiff against the princi- pal/employer can be derived in the following manner: if the agent/employee is liable, then the tort creditor is entitled to be compen- sated out of the agent/employee's patrimony; one element of value that the agent/employee holds is the principal's promise of indemnification for just this type of situation; the agent/employee can then compensate 135 This amalgam is taken from P.S.

[hereinafter London Drugs] (indemnification model is properly the 'best solution' to the general problem of vicarious liability).

(Oxford: Clarendon, 1990) at 502-8.</page><page sequence="26">198 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL the plaintiff by transferring this valuable promise.1'" Since, in most situations the damages will indeed be borne by the principal, the doc- trine of vicarious liability eliminates a duplicity of actions by allowing the plaintiff to be subrogated to the tortfeasing agent's right to indemnifica- tion by means of a suit against the principle directly. Thus, we have a formal explanation of vicarious liability that can now be used to examine the limited liability of shareholders and directors with respect with claims by tort creditors of the corporation. Before doing that, however, it is interesting to note how this theory of vicarious liability also replicates the plaintiff's ability in positive law to sue the corporate patrimony directly. Since directors, corporate agents, and employees all carry with them a promise of indemnity from the corporate patrimony, the plaintiff may be subrogated to this claim.140 With subroga- tion complete, the reality of the situation makes it seem as if the plaintiff had sued the company directly. When this is realized, it is but a small procedural step to saying that the plaintiff may always sue the corporate patrimony directly."41 Thus, from the agent's right of indemnification the private law model can effectively replicate the current doctrinal ability to sue the company directly and to demonstrate how the corporate patri- mony can be said to be vicariously liability for the actions of a natural person. With a theory of vicarious liability sketched, and an explanation of the right to sue the corporate patrimony identified, the central point that now has to be addressed is to justify the limited liability of the sharehold- ers, directors, and other employees for the tortious acts of a corporate agent/employee. When vicarious liability is properly understood, this is in fact done quite easily and flows as a matter of logic from the legal principles at play. As Professor David Stevens rightly contends: [A] tort creditor cannot recover against directors or shareholders, since no agent of the corporation is by virtue of that fact an agent of the directors or of the shareholders and, therefore, there is no promise by the directors and sharehold- ers to indemnify the tortfeasor/agent. Hence, limited liability in respect of the tort obligations of the corporation."14 139 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 422. 140 Although this type of procedure may seem strange when the subrogation is to a fund rather than a natural person, such a process is also in accord with Trust doctrine, which allows creditors to be subrogated to the indemnity right of the trustee from the Trust corpus. See Hayton, supra note 105 at 6; ReJohnson (1880), 15 Ch. D. 548. 141 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 422. 142 Ibid. at 422.</page><page sequence="27">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 199 In other words, since neither the directors nor shareholders committed an actionable fault themselves or promised to indemnify the agent/ employee from their personal patrimonies, there is no legal basis for imposing liability (either primary or secondary) on the directors or shareholders for the actions of a 'corporate' agent/employee. Liability can only be imposed on the corporate patrimony because, through non- recourse contracts, this is the only group of funds in which a corporate agent/employee has a claim. When viewed in this manner, limited liability is not a privilege bestowed upon corporate actors by the legislator but rather flows from the legal principles that apply equally to all natural persons. While this view is coherent, its analysis might elicit some comments from a pragmatic lawyer: 'Well, what if I do not accept your theory of vicarious liability? Or, what if the true construction of a contract of employment, as opposed to one of agency, is that there is no promise of indemnity?143 Can the private law model still provide limited liability for shareholders and directors? Or does the whole model rest solely upon its own theory of vicarious liability and its own interpretation of the contract of employment?' The answer to these questions is that, even given the current black letter law, the private law model can provide effective limited liability for all corporate participants. In order to answer this question it is best to begin the analysis with the shareholders, and it is necessary to break down the corporate agent/employee metaphor. When this is done an answer can be formu- lated in the following manner. Whatever the theoretical justification for the principle of respondeat superior, it is a status-based version of civil responsibility. In common law, the status that is legally important for vicarious liability is that of employer, rather than that of owner, economic beneficiary, or interested party.'44 From our analysis, it is clear that it is the directors, not the shareholders, who are the employers of general staff of a corporation. Therefore, there is limited liability for the share- holders for actions of a director's employees. The only unresolved question that remains in respect of shareholders is their vicarious liability for the acts of their directors. In other words, is a director an employee of the shareholders? The answer on traditional tort doctrine is relatively clear. 45 Since directors are both fiduciaries who have vast discretion to 143 As in Lister, supra note 138. 144 It is in this confusion of 'status' where commentators such as Goddard, supra note 35 err. 145 As is usual in the common law tradition, it is unclear what test should be used to determine whether one is an employee or an independent contractor for situations of vicarious liability. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the test transforms</page><page sequence="28">200 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL manage the corporate patrimony, and are not subject to directions from the shareholders, they are by definition independent contractors rather than employees. Hence, there is also limited liability for shareholders when faced with the claim that their vicarious liability stems from the fault of directors. This brings us to the question of the directors. Of course, when a traditional status-only based justification of vicarious liability is used, the plaintiff who has been tortuously injured by an 'employee' of a corporate patrimony could sue the directors as the actual 'employers' of the corporate employees, since a fund cannot in truth complete a contract or act as principal. While this may cast a doubt on the limited liability of the directors, it must be remembered that, in respect of damages imposed upon them for vicarious liability of the employees, the directors are entitled as of right to indemnity from the corporate patrimony. Thus, so long as the patrimony is adequately capitalized or insured, all directors enjoy effective or practical limited liability for the actions of corporate employees. In sum, we can therefore say that the private law model is capable of providing a coherent account of limited liability for directors, sharehold- ers, and other employees from the claims of tort creditors. This analysis holds true whether vicarious liability is based on a right of indemnity or purely on status. Since the private law model also provides a coherent account of limited liability from contract creditors for both the sharehold- ers and directors, it can provisionally claim to be a valid theory of the corporation. All that remains is to see if the private law model can account for the other attributes traditionally associated with the corporation. B. EFFECTIVE LEGAL PERSONALITY The 'D' and 's' contracts create a separate corporate patrimony and divide the incidents of ownership between the directors, who are to administer the property, and the shareholders, who hold the residual proprietary rights and exercise limited supervisory functions."14 When this is combined with 'non-recourse/fund-following' contracts with depending on the purpose for which it is used - very different considerations, and thus tests, are used to distinguish between the two legal classifications in taxation, social security, workers' compensation, private law, and industrial safety cases, see Fleming, supra note 136 at 409-13 and Flannigan, supra note 135 at 25, 27. But as Fleming, at 416 notes, the 'temptation to use precedents interchangeably calls for caution because the same policy may not be involved in a different context.' With this in mind it is submitted that the best formal distinction between the two for the purposes of private law is the traditional control test (which also concords with civilian thinking on the issue, see Arts. 2085, 2098, 2099 C.C.Q.). 146 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 422.</page><page sequence="29">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 201 creditors, the use of corporate agents, and the subrogation of tort creditors to an agent's indemnity claims, we have created a separate fund which 'may be charged with civil obligations, as though it were a princi- pal, a real person."'47 When these two ideas of a separate corporate patrimony and the status of principal are combined, one sees how this nexus of contracts manifests effective legal personality. Thus, in many situations it makes sense to use the expression 'legal person' to speak of the corporation or company as though it were a natural person. When the legal situations are simple, this metaphor substitutes 'for the more complex legal description just sketched."' 148 Therefore, in many ordinary cases it is quite appropriate and useful for the judge to use a traditional (albeit morally de-personified) theory of the corporation to solve legal problems.'4" But it must also be remembered that in more difficult fact situations such as those dealing with oppression, veil-piercing, or take- overs, the metaphor will have to be deconstructed so that the courts will not be misled by oversimplification and thereby corrupt Canadian corporate law doctrine.150 C. FREE TRANSFERABILITY OF SHARES Much like the other traditional characteristics of the corporation, free transferability of shares flows directly from the necessary implications of both the 'D' and 's' contracts. Since both of these establish that share- holders are not mutual agents of each other or the directors, there is no juridical reason why the status of shareholder should depend on any- thing other than the ability of the transferee to pay the purchase price of the shares.'"' Thus, we have free transferability of shares. D. PERPETUAL EXISTENCE S&amp; SEPARATION OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL Perpetual existence also flows from the nexus of contracts that create the corporate patrimony. Since shares are freely transferable and inheritable, and directors are replaceable on election by the shareholders, both the continued 'existence' of the corporate patrimony and its administration 147 Ibid. at 422. 148 Ibid. at 423; M. Radin, 'A Restatement of Hohfeld' (1938) 51 Harv. L. Rev. 1141 at 1161. In this sense, the metaphor of the 'corporation' is a like an algebraic term which simplifies mathematical analysis, L.L. Fuller, Legal Fictions (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1967) at 81. 149 As Bouckaert, supra note 130 at 157 has argued, 'It would be foolish to deny, against the common wisdom of legal practice in nearly the whole world, that the notion of corporate personality has [some] value for the legal order.' 150 As Cardozo J. stated in Berkey v. Third Ave. Ry., 244 N.Y. 84 (C.A. 1926) at 61, 'Metaphors in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices to liberate thought, they end often by enslaving it.' 151 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 423; Hohfeld, supra note 91 at 306.</page><page sequence="30">202 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL are not dependant upon the life of any one natural person.'52 Logically, therefore, a corporation may, just like a valid purpose trust, exist forever.'53 Similarly, since the corporate contracts provide for the powers of the directors to manage and enumerate the situations in which the shareholders will be able to intervene, the separation of ownership and control is also effected through the private law model.'54 Therefore, since the private law model can replicate and explain limited liability, legal personality, free transferability of shares, perpetual existence, and separation of ownership and control through jural rela- tionships between natural persons, it is a valid and persuasive legal theory of the corporation. All that remains is to test the private law model of the corporation on truly difficult fact situations to show that it does indeed provide a better tool for dealing with corporate law problems. But, before going on to that endeavour, it is necessary to deal with the most probable questions and classic objections to the theory just proposed. E. QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIONS RELATING TO THE PRIVATE LAW MODEL 1. General Responses Given that a theory such as that proposed here is a radical departure, in some senses, from the traditional black letter law, there are bound to be many questions and objections. In order to confront these concerns in an orderly fashion, it is proposed to deal with the most particular objec- tions first and then to move on to the more theoretical objections later. Perhaps the first of these objections by the pragmatic lawyer would be something similar this: 'If there is no legal person, and the shareholders are the creditors of the obligation, then clearly the obligation must be something like acting in the best interests of shareholders or maximising shareholder value?' Why is the promise to 'maximize NPV'? The answer to this question is three-fold. The first reason to prefer the NPV interpreta- tion is that it helps to underscore, and flows from, the 'non-agent' char- acterization of the directors' obligation to the shareholders. Since the object of the obligation is not for the direct benefit of the shareholders, the courts will be less likely to mischaracterize the relationship as some- thing else, most notably a partnership.'15 152 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 423. 153 Ibid. at 423. 154 As Pickering, supra note 33 at 502 states, 'Like the trust, the company enables the proprietary interests of natural persons to be associated and reconstituted in a manner which makes possible a real division of the ownership and control of the property.' 155 For an example of this mistake, see Goldwater v. Oltman, 210 Cal. 408 (S.C. 1930) (ability to elect trustee changed organisation from non-agency Trust to mutual-agency partnership).</page><page sequence="31">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 203 The second reason for the NPV promise is that it eliminates many of the problems and questions inherent in the formulation of the directors' duty in terms of 'shareholder interest' or 'value.' One of these questions, which ultimately arise, is which shareholders' interest or value should the directors be seeking to maximize: the totality, the majority, the preferred, or the common?'"6 Another of these questions relates to the time frame of the maximization. Should the directors focus on short-, medium-, or long-term value?'57 When viewed as an obligation to maximise NPV, however, these problems do not occur. Since it is the value of the patri- mony that is being maximized, it is the totality of the shareholders who will benefit. Furthermore, since the standard used is NPV, the time frame and risk of any given investment are already included in the calculation, as 'present' value reflects the expected stream of cash flow discounted by the time value of money and risk.s58 When viewed in this manner, the NPV promise is thus most likely both what the shareholders would want and what was traditionally meant by the courts' use of 'best interests,' at least before the advent of the hostile takeover. '59 The third and more important reason for the NPV promise is to obviate the tendency, currently en vogue, of arbitrarily switching the object of the obligation when the corporate patrimony is approaching insolvency. This novation under traditional doctrine is necessary due to the well-known divergence of shareholder and creditor interests at insolvency.160 This switching was traditionally accomplished through the rationalization that the 'company,' which was once the shareholders', 'magically' becomes 'the creditors' through the factual realization that at insolvency the creditors were the only 'residual' claimants.'"' As was stated in Kinsela v. Russell Kinsela Pty. Ltd.:'62 In a solvent company the proprietary interests of the shareholders entitle them as a general body to be regarded as the company when questions of the duty of directors arise.... But where a company is insolvent the interests of the creditors 156 For examples of inevitable conflict, J. R. Macey &amp; G. P.

They become prospectively entitled through the mechanism of liquida- tion, to displace the power of the shareholders and directors to deal with the com- pany's assets. It is in a practical sense their assets and not the shareholders'.... Therefore, the 'best interests' of the company are still being served. The only difference is that the determination of 'who' comprised the com- pany has changed. But, this factual realization of who is to benefit through liquidation is not a sufficient justification to change the legal characterization of the duty, absent legislation. The factual dilemma is solved, however, by the promise to maximize NPV. When the directors are under such a duty, they will not be legally allowed to 'bet the farm' in these situations by choosing a higher-variance lower-NPV value investment to benefit the shareholders.'16 Therefore, since there is little practical difference in the outcome between a duty to maximize NPV and one for the benefit of shareholder interests or value,l" but large gains in legal coherence to be made by adopting the NPV interpretation, it is suggested that the private law model's formulation is to be preferred. This immediately leads to the next question from the pragmatic jurist, 'What good is it for the creditors to have a duty to maximize NPV if they cannot enforce it?' Stated from a different perspective, what about the expectations of creditors? Since our legal system only protects expecta- tions that are the result of contractual undertakings orjustified detrimen- tal reliance, the question must be 'Do "corporate agents" also make the NPV promise to creditors?' Clearly, directors and corporate agents do sometimes explicitly promise to maximize NPV and, if this is done, the creditor can enforce this or any similar promise if it has been explicitly included in the debt contract.'65 However, it also seems likely that directors and corporate agents also implicitly make this promise to, or engender detrimental reliance in, all outside contracting parties. Evi- dence that there is such an implicit promise, or real reliance, can be found not only in the Canadian corporate law remedies which are framed widely enough to include conduct detrimental to a creditor,'66 163 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 421. For examples of where 'shareholder interest' would tempt one to choose a lower NPV investment, see 'Corporate,' supra note 156 at 407-9. 164 For a similar view, see Clark, supra note 9 at s.16.2 (678). 165 Sophisticated lenders often do protect themselves with similar precautions, see Cheffins, supra note 3 at 81. 166 See C.B.C.A. s. 241 (1) which states that an action may be brought for oppression when the actions complained of 'unfairly disregards the interests of any security holder, creditor, director or officer.' Furthermore both s.238 (d) ('complainant' is 'any other person who ... is a proper person') and s.1 ('security' includes 'a debt obligation') are set wide enough to include a creditor. See also O.B.C.A., s.248, s.245. In the case law,</page><page sequence="33">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 205 but also in the ever-increasing Commonwealth case law which posits such a duty.'67 Thus, given the evidence, it is suggested that in the majority of cases it is proper to interpret an outside contract for the benefit of the corporate patrimony as containing an implied term that the directors will act with care and loyalty to maximize its NPV. What should be noted, however, is that the right of such a creditor would rarely be exercised outside conditions of insolvency. So long as the creditors are being paid, they would have no material interest in the costly litigation necessary for its enforcement. A related question is, 'What is the effect of shareholder voting in relation to breaches of the directors' NPV promise? If a majority of the shareholders could ratify breaches, then the protection offered to minority shareholders and creditors would be meaningless.' Pleasantly, the Canadian case law, doctrine, and the private law model are all in substantial conformity on this issue. Since the shareholders are not in a relationship of agency with the directors, they are not principals who can, even theoretically, ratify a breach.'16 Similarly, since the contractual right to have the directors' honour their duties can be enforced by all share- holders, there is no way that these breaches can be sanctioned by any majority. Likewise, if the 'maximise NPV promise' is made to creditors as well, even the unanimous vote of the shareholders would not effect rights created by an outside contract. As Professor Welling correctly argues, ratification can only cure a breach of duty when it is 'voiced by the person to whom the duty was owed. A purported ratification by one see,for example, First Edmonton Place Ltd. v. 315888 Alberta Ltd. (1988), 60 Alta. L.R. (2d) 122 (Q.B.); Prime Computer of Can. Ltd. v. Jeffrey (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 673 (Gen. Div.) (removal of funds from corporation oppressive to creditor).

Thus, although a person or a group of people can decide to forgive a breach personally, this has no effect on the rights of the others.170 This conclu- sion as to the irrelevance of shareholder ratification of fiduciary breaches is also evidenced by section 242 of the C.B.C.A.'71 and is in conformity with the Trust doctrine on the issue. 72 Thus, as Professor Welling astutely claims, the issue of 'ratification is passe in Canadian corporate law.'73" Another objection to the private law model is that it would create a system that destroys the present regime's equal treatment of creditors and shareholders in the recovery of damages for directors' malfeasance. Under this view, the primary function of the 'legal person' doctrine and 'procedural' rules such as those in Foss v. Harbottle is to guarantee that all damages for harm done by the directors will be 'mediated through the company' and shared by all in proportion to their stake."17 Present doctrine, therefore, ensures that no one can 'jump the queue,' recover personal damages from the directors, and thereby prejudice the chances of recovery for other stakeholders in the company. Furthermore, these same authors contend that the 'legal person' metaphor is effective in ensuring that there is neither a multiplicity of actions nor 'double recovery' for the same loss.175 Under this view the private law model is flawed, especially in situations of insolvency, in that it cannot replicate this mediation of damages through the company, which guarantees that all claimants will be treated on a pari passu basis.'76 While this argument appears persuasive, an examination of the private law model reveals that it does in fact replicate the mediation of damages through the corporate patrimony. Under private law principles, when a creditor or shareholder sues the director, she is only allowed to receive damages that reflect her actual loss. In order to compensate the plaintiff properly, the court has two options. The first, and most conceptually certain of these, is to order that damages for the whole breach be paid into the corporate patrimony so that all shareholders and creditors 'are compensated exactly in accordance with the harm caused to them, and 169 Corporate Law, supra note 8 at 430. 170 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 426. 171 C.B.C.A., supra note 24 at s. 242(1) (application will not be dismissed 'by reason only that it is shown that the alleged breach of a right or duty ... has been or may be approved by the shareholders').

Either way, the effect is that the damages are 'mediated' through the company, ensuring that no shareholder or creditor can get a 'leg up' by suing first. A further, albeit more theoretical, objection to the private law model proposed is the claim that under our system of common law it is just not possible to create a separate patrimony by the mutual agreement of natural persons.'17 In order for such a creation to be effective the partici- pation of the legislator is necessary.180 Although this may seem persuasive at first glance, the analogy with the Trust helps to show why this view is not plausible. In his influential text on the law of Trusts,'8' Professor D.J. Hayton defines that institution: A trust arises where property is transferred by a person to trustees to be managed or dealt with for the benefit of the beneficiaries or a charitable purpose: such property is not part of the trustee's patrimony but is a separate fiduciary patri- mony not available for the trustee's creditors, spouse or heirs.'82 Further on in his definition, Professor Hayton also comments that the Trust instrument need not be filed or registered with any official agency and is often a confidential document known only by the trustee and the beneficiary.'8* Thus, given that the common law already allows for the creation of separate patrimonies without the intervention of the legisla- tor, it is clear that it is possible to create a corporate patrimony through the use of the private law model.'84 177 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 458. 178 It might be impracticable when the calculations are too complex or where there is a multiplicity of actions pending. In these cases, the judge would simply order the first remedy. 179 This seems to be the argument of Wolff, supra note 2 at 497. 180 See also, Gower's, supra note 9 at 7 (corporate law's main function is to empower people 'to do what they could not otherwise achieve - namely, to create a body with distinct corporate personality'). 181 Hayton, supra note 105. 182 Ibid. at 1. 183 Ibid. at 2. 184 See also, M. Radin, 'The Endless Problem of Corporate Personality' (1932) 32 Colum. L. Rev. 643 at 654 [hereinafter 'Endless'] ('there is no reason in the world, why, if men choose to do so, they cannot be permitted to pledge, not their personal credit, but only a specific amount of property or money').</page><page sequence="36">208 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL The next related objection is that the private law model cannot explain how a 'one-person company' can be formed, in contradistinction to the 'logical' outcome of the legal person doctrine enunciated in such cases as Salomon v. Salomon and Lee v. Lee's Air Farming Ltd.s85 In other words, if it is true that the private law model is a nexus of contracts, how can a single person create one? It is here where the analogy with the Trust is also helpful. Just as a person may declare herself to be a trustee of property by a unilateral act,'86 one can also perform the 'D' and 's' contracts through a unilateral juridical act. Thus, a person may declare that she has transferred assets to a separate patrimony, will administer that patrimony with care and loyalty to maximize its NPV, and then contract with outside creditors on that basis.'87 Of course, if she commits a tort while acting as a director, the tortfeasor will be liable to the injured party just as any director may. But, like any director, she will also be entitled to an indemnity. Thus, so long as the corporate patrimony is not undercapitalized, the 'one-woman company' will enjoy limited liability from both tort and contract creditors. 2. Specific Response to H.L.A. Hart While the aforementioned objections have been answered, perhaps the most potent criticism levelled at any theory resembling the private law model was that espoused by H.L.A. Hart in his influential article, 'Defini- tion and Theory in Jurisprudence.'188 In formulating his own positivist account of corporate personality, Professor Hart took time to let his concerns be known over Hohfeld's theory of the corporation. The ques- tion now is whether or not the newer version of the private law model can meet this challenge. Hart's objection to the private law model was two- fold and consists of the argument that it gives us both too much and too little as a theory of the corporation. It gives the jurist too much because '[i]t dissipates the unity of the simple statement 'Smith &amp; Co. has a contract with Y,' and substitutes a statement of the myriad legal rights, duties, powers, etc., of numerous individuals of whom we never have 185 [1961] A.C. 12 (P.C.). 186 See Paulv. Constance, [1977] 1 All E.R. 195 (C.A.). In fact, declaring oneself a trustee is one of the principal ways to constitute a trust, see Hayton, supra note 105 at 277. This analogy with the Trust can be taken only so far, however, given the merger of legal and equitable title that occurs under traditional doctrine when these interests are held by a single person, see Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentralev. Islington L.B.C., [1996] 2 W.L.R. 802 (H.L.) at 830 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. 187 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 420-1. 188 H.L.A. Hart, 'Definition And Theory In Jurisprudence' in Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983) 21.</page><page sequence="37">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 209 thought...." " In other words, the private law model's definition of the corporation has destroyed the very thing that it had sought to explain and in so doing defined a highly functional piece of doctrine out of existence."' Such a theory also gives too little because it does not 'draw a conclusion of law from the special rules relating to companies and from rules extended by analogy from the case of individuals.' 1'1 In other words, it doesn't explain how and why the current law operates to impose liability on corporations through an analogy with natural persons. Instead of this type of inquiry into what a corporation is, Hart argues that the jurist should instead ask herself the question, 'Under what types of conditions does the law ascribe liabilities to corporations?'1" 2 Although thought provoking and interesting, Hart's arguments fail to be a wholly persuasive attack on the private law model of the corporation for the following reasons. If in regards to the claim that the private law model gives too much, Hart's argument is simply that such a theory is too complicated to be useful; it is seriously flawed. Many of our legal institu- tions, such as the Trust, are in fact more complicated than the private law model of the corporation herein proposed. Furthermore, what Hart seems to forget is that legal statements relating to natural persons are equally complicated in his theory. As Professor Carl Auerbach argues, the statement that Smith owes a thousand pounds to Y 'is as complicated as the legal personality of the 'Smith &amp; Co.' ... The legal personality of Smith must also be analysed ... and inquiry made into the laws determin- ing which of Smith's assets are subject to and which exempt from execution, whether Smith may go into voluntary or be driven into involuntary bankruptcy, etc.'19' So the conceptual rigour and complete- ness of the private law model cannot, by itself, be grounds for it giving the jurist too much. If the argument is that, in comparison with the simple idea of the 'legal person' the private law model destroys the functional utility of the concept, than this is equally untrue. The private law model does not dispute that it can be useful to use the metaphor of the 'legal person' in a simple situation, such as Hart's example of making a contract with an outside creditor."'4 What the private law model asserts is that in more 189 Ibid. at 41. 190 Dias, supra note 2 at 267. 191 Hart, supra note 188 at 41. 192 C.A. Auerbach, 'On Professor H.L.A. Hart's "Definition and Theory in Juris- prudence" (1956) 9J. Leg. Ed. 39 at 44 from Hart, supra note 188 at 42-4. 193 Auerbach, supra note 192 at 45. 194 But one wonders if Hart was not overstating the simplicity of even this type of situation given that the problems of ultra vires and pre-incorporation contracts still plagued</page><page sequence="38">210 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL complex situations - such as veil-piercing, parent-subsidiary relations, take-over battles, or shareholder claims of oppression - the simple meta- phor is harmful and leads to seriously erroneous conclusions. In these situations, the 'legal person' metaphor must be dropped and the underly- ing jural relations and contractual expectations of the natural persons involved must be explored. Since the organizing theme ofa 'separate legal person' does not really help to solve any of these modern legal problems, and is itself amended by modern statutory interventions to increase its usefulness,"'!" it is submitted that thirty-year-old claims as to its functional simplicity are today less persuasive. Thus, the private law model does not give 'too much,' as Hart claimed, but rather onlywhat is necessary to reach a proper understanding of this complicated phenomenon. This brings us to Hart's second argument: that the private law model gives us too little and thereby fails to explain the law as it is presently formulated.'~" In other words, while the theory is analytical, it is not descriptive."'7 The answer to this objection is that when the law is as radically incoherent as our present system of corporate law, it would be folly to try to explain it in the terms in which it currently presents itself. While Hart and many scholars may be content to describe the law as it appears the private law model's purpose is different. It tries to unify the underlying principles of the statutes and case law into a coherent whole that can subsequently be used to justify future outcomes or conclusions of law. Through this process, courts can be given genuine guidance as to how they should solve corporate law problems beyond merely following the words of precedent and working out analogies with natural persons willy-nilly. In doing so, however, the private law model is more descriptive and predicative than first appears. As will be seen with the discussion in Part III, the private law model can justify the outcomes of the founda- tional corporate law cases on a more solid and coherent foundation. In further response to Hart's second argument, one can say that Hart himself gives too little. His analysis gives no principled reason why the legal rules surrounding corporations should be constructed by analogy to natural persons or how far these analogies should be taken."98 If his answer to why is solely that this is the way that it has always been done, English corporate law at the time he was writing, see for example, Ashbury Ry. Carriage &amp; Iron co. v. Riche (1875), L.R. 7 H.L. 653; Kelnerv. Baxter (1866), L.R. 2 C.P. 175 (Ct. C.P.). 195 See, for example, C.B.C.A., ss. 14, 15, which deal with the problems of pre-incorporation and ultra vires contracts respectively. 196 This theme is picked up in some of the jurisprudence texts, see R. Wacks, Jurisprudence, 4th ed. (London: Blackstone, 1995) at 257. 197 Dias, supra note 2 at 267. 198 Hart, supra note 188 at 44 himself argues that this is 'a debatable legal issue.'</page><page sequence="39">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 211 this is a far from satisfactory principled reason for the imposition of legal liability. Likewise, the mere fact that the inanimate collection of property is called a legal person cannot decide the issue. We could instead call it a 'right and duty bearing' unit or a 'quasi-trust.'199 As Gregory Mark argues, 'Corporations could have been seen as analogous to either individuals or governments. Alternatively, these analogies could have been rejected and theorists and policy-makers could have developed an entirely new body of law to supersede contemporary doctrine.'200 Without any justification at the centre of Hart's theory beyond positivism it is reasonable to ask why the analogy is not made with animals,201 the legal responsibility and personality of children,202 or the rules that pertain to the state and government.20? While Hart's theory may not be able to answer both problems of 'why' and 'how far,' the private law model can do so. It provides a principled reason why the legal rules surrounding the corporate patrimony are often analogized to those that apply to individuals. This is due to the fact that the contractual relations and agreements between the natural persons involved create the illusion that the corporation is acting in a fashion similar to a natural person. Thus, we can speak of a 'corporate agent' because the effect of the corporate contracts is to give the factual appearance that the corporate patrimony is a principal. In response to the second problem, that dealing with the scope of these analogies, the private law model suggests that these can only be taken as far as they correspond to the effects of the underlying corporate contracts. When the analogy and the private law model differ, the analogy must be abandoned. Thus, it is submitted that the private law model is able to meet Hart's criticisms and is in fact a more satisfactory way of examining the legal nature of the corporation. Having examined the more detailed objections to the private law model outlined above, it is now necessary to finish our inquiry by quickly showing how the private law model differs from the two other major contractual theories of the corporation: the economic 'nexus of con- tracts' and the traditional English model. 199 See B. Smith, 'Legal Personality' (1928) 37 Yale L.J. 283 at 283. 200 G.A Mark, 'The Personification of the Business Corporation In American Law' (1987) 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1441 at 1445. 201 If corporations cannot act without ascribing to them the actions of natural persons and are thus inanimate with no moral personality as Hart, supra note 188 at 42-3 seems to argue, doesn't the analogy with animals seem appropriate? 202 This is sometimes the solution of Professor Welling, see Corporate Law, supra note 8 at c. 3. 203 Does not the hierarchical structure and power-wielding ability of these vast patrimonies more closely resemble the state than a person? See M. Stokes, 'Company Law and Legal Theory' in Legal Theory and Common Law, ed. W. Twinning (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986) 155 at 177 ff.</page><page sequence="40">212 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL 3. DIFFERENTIATING THE PRIVATE LAW MODEL FROM OTHER CONTRACTUAL MODELS At first glance, the private law model of the corporation herein proposed seems essentially similar to economic theory. Both theories posit that the corporation is simply a 'nexus of contracts' between the various actors, that there is no such thing as a legal person, and that limited liability is by far the most important attribute of the corporation. While the conclu- sions reached by the two theories share some similarities, there are significant differences that demand highlighting. The first major differ- ence is that the two theories are approaching their subject matter from totally different perspectives and disciplines. Thus, the economist is offering an explanation of the firm's purpose rather than delimiting its key concepts. Questions posed by the economist are posed as a legislator, who asks, 'What rules would it be efficient to make?'2"4 Instead, the pri- vate law model poses and answers inquiries as a lawyer or adjudicator, asking, 'What rules would be most coherent given what our legal system is already committed to?'205 The second difference, which is directly related to the first, is that both economists and lawyers use terms such as contract, agent, and principal in completely different manners.2"" Thus, for the economist, contracts can be hypothetically imposed between two idealized value maximizers protecting all sorts of expectations, rather than being a legally binding agreement between two natural persons supported by consideration or cause.2"' Thus, great difficulty ensues when one tries to actually 'translate' the economic understandings of the parties into legal contracts.208 Is the corporation merely the 'core contracts' between shareholders, directors, and officers? Are bondholders, customers, and employees third-party beneficiaries to the core contract? Are all the parties, including bondholders, customers, and employees,joint obligees- obligors or mutual agents?2.9 Unless one starts from a legal framework, these questions are virtually unanswerable through the application of 204 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 378. 205 Ibid. at 378. 206 See V. Brudney, 'Corporate Governance, Agency Costs, and the Rhetoric of Contract' (1985) 85 Colum. L. Rev. 1403 at 1403-4; W.W.

Rev. 679 at 719 ff. who experiences this translation difficulty. 209 Ibid. at 719-20.</page><page sequence="41">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 213 economic theory. Thus, despite its supposed 'contractual' nature, the theory espoused by the economist is more a theory of the 'firm' resting on that science's foundations than a legal explanation of the corpora- tion.21" Economists may be able to tell us what is prudent and efficient but they cannot tell us what is just or owed as a matter of right. Although helpful to the legislator (if one accepts its basic premises), economic analysis is of little use to the courts.211 In contrast, the proposed private law model strives to be useful to the adjudicator by helping her solve the difficult doctrinal questions posed by complicated corporate dealings. While the economic approach and the contractual model herein proposed are in some respects profoundly different, the private law model also differs from the contractual model inherited from Great Britain.22 This influential 'contractual' model of the company finds its foundations in s.14 of the Companies Act (UK), which states that the memorandum and articles of association, when registered, bind the company and its members as though each had signed them and cove- nanted to bind all future holders. This allusion to agreement is said to es- tablish the contractual nature of the English model.213 When one exam- ines the case law surrounding this model, however, one soon sees that it does not take its contractual nature seriously. Although the English model is rife with such contradictions,214 one example will suffice to illustrate. This example can be found in that body of case law surround- ing the ability of the shareholders to enforce the corporate contract. Although there has been much debate among academic commentators215 the general rule is that the memorandum and articles, bestow rights on 210 On the basic principles underlying the economic analysis of law, see F.H. Buckley et al., supra note 69 at c.1; Cheffins, supra note 3 at c.1-5. 211 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 461. See also, Private Law, supra note 11; R. Dworkin, Law's Empire (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986); P. Benson, 'The Idea of a Public Basis ofJustification for Contract' (1995) 33 Osgoode Hall L.J. 273. 212 This model is still the basis of the British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia corporation statutes, inter alia, see Canadian, supra note 84 at 192-3. 213 'Regulation,' supra note 8 at 424. 214 As ibid. at 426 argues: 'There is an obvious logical tension in the English model between its claims that the corporation is a contract, the corporation is the majority, and the corporation is actually a separate person with a will. As presented and applied in English law, the ideas are not wholly compatible and the model is, as a consequence, radically incoherent. For example, if the corporation is a contract, then why does not the minority shareholder who is harmed by the director's breach have a right to enforce it? Or, if the corporation is a separate legal person from the shareholders for the purpose of limited liability, then how can the shareholders ratify - as though they were principals - the wrongs of directors?' [citations omitted]. 215 For a summary of this debate see Gower's, supra note 9 at 115-22.</page><page sequence="42">214 UNIVERSITIY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL the shareholder only in her 'capacity' as shareholder.216 Therefore, the shareholder typically cannot sue to enforce 'outsider rights'217 nor rights that deal with one's status as, for example, a director or officer.~18 On closer examination, these limits on the right of shareholders are impossible to square with the idea that the English model is contractual. Under the common law system of contract law, a breach of any term is actionable by the innocent party, who may always seek a remedy for the violation of her rights.219 Either the articles and memorandum are an enforceable contract or they are not; a rational and coherent system of law cannot have it both ways. In contrast to the English model, the private law model of the corporation takes its contractual nature seriously as an organizing principle and does not place arbitrary and thus incoher- ent limits on the parties in their enforcement of contractual rights. Instead, the private law model enforces all the terms contained in the 'D' and 's' contracts.22" Thus, although both the English and private law models are said to be contractual, only the private law model truly lives up to this claim. In sum, having outlined the contractual relations that constitute the corporation, answered specific doctrinal questions, and addressed traditional criticisms, one can claim that the private law model provides a plausible theory of the corporation that explains all of its traditional attributes. Furthermore, the fact that such a theory exists reveals that continued reliance on the black-letter doctrine of the legal person, which renders our corporate doctrine incoherent, is no longer necessary. The only remaining task then is to see whether the private law model is in fact useful by testing it on a complex body of case law; in this instance, those cases that are said to justify piercing the corporate veil. 216 Compare Hickman v. Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders'Assoc., [1915] 1 Ch. 881 with Salmon v. Quinn &amp; Axtens Ltd., [1909] 1 Ch. 311 (C.A.). 217 Term was coined by L.

In Part II, it hypothesized that the central principle of this body of law is that a corporation is a nexus of contracts between natural persons. In light of this argument, the purpose of Part III is to test the private law model on the veil-piercing cases to see if it is able to answer, coherently and analytically, the questions raised by these fact patterns. Given this focus this section will therefore examine how these cases interact with the limited liability of key participants, rather than asking what they tell us about the 'legal person.' Further- more, since limited liability is key, other cases not traditionally included under veil-piercing, such as those dealing with the liability of directors for corporate misrepresentation, will also be examined. The argument of this section is that there is nothing exceptionally difficult about these cases - nothing, that is, besides the confusing rhetoric. When the cases are re- examined using the private law model, one finds that courts are holding, or in some cases shielding, natural persons from liability for the same reason that they use to justify their decisions in the non-corporate law context. If the participants have breached a contract, committed a fault, or been unjustly enriched, then liability will be imposed. Conversely, if they have done none of these things or have contracted for an exclusion, liability will not be imposed. The argument is that simple. It shows that the corporate form is not some sort of privilege that is shielding people from the liabilities imposed by common law.221 For the sake of simplicity the analysis will be grouped into the follow- ing categories: Legislative Interventions, Statutory Interpretation, Agency, Fraud or Mere Facade, and Tort. A word of caution, however, is in order. To keep this paper to manageable proportions, this section will not examine all the cases or situations that are sometimes associated with piercing the corporate veil. Instead it will look at the classic and most recent authority and minimize its coverage of other areas. For example, it will not look at the issue of 'undercapitalization,' as this is of less impor- tance in the Canadian and Commonwealth context in comparison with the other categories.222 Furthermore, this section will not examine the 221 See contra 'Agents,' supra note 33 at 32 ('Corporate legislation, it must be recognised creates a fiction which, in effect, detracts from the manifest principle of the common law that a person is responsible for that which he does or authorizes.'). 222 Most Canadian casebooks have a limited discussion based on the American case of Walkovsky v. Carlton, 276 N.Y.S. 2d 585 (C.A. 1966) (undercapitalisation denied as a justification for veil-piercing), see Cases &amp; Materials, supra note 40 at 202.</page><page sequence="44">216 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL issues of parent-subsidiary relations or enterprise entity in any in-depth manner. This is done not because the category is unimportant, but rather because such an examination requires more space and argument than is possible here and raises issues beyond the scope of this inquiry.22" With that caveat made known the re-examination can begin. A. LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTIONS Quite often, for reasons of public policy, the legislator will act to render persons liable for actions that under the regime of private law would be unactionable. Similarly, the legislator may use her power to instruct the courts to ignore, reinterpret, or render unenforceable the legal relations and contracts (nominate or otherwise) that natural persons have in fact constructed.224 Even within the field of corporate law itself the limited liability of participants predicted by the private law model is bounded by provisions of the C.B.C.A. Thus, the C.B.C.A. s.119 imposes liability on directors, jointly and severally, for up to six months of back wages owed to employees.225 But this is not unusual and no one would deny that the legislator has the ability to 'demand that courts ignore all the concep- tions and principles that are at the root of company law.'226 Much like the traditional view, then, the private law model recognizes that the legislator can and will alter the corporate contract in pursuit of public policy. In contradistinction to traditional writing on the subject, however, the private law model does not worry whether or not these types of interventions 'pierce the corporate veil.' Instead, the analysis herein 223 One such question is whether or not the legislator should recognize a new 'nominate' contract or body of law to deal with the issue of parent-subsidiary relations as has been done in the German legal system, see N.C. Sargent, 'Corporate Groups and the Corporate Veil In Canada: A Penetrating Look At Parent-Subsidiary Relations in the Modern Corporate Enterprise' (1988) 17 Man. L.J. 156 at 181. Furthermore, most group enterprise cases have more to do with statutory interpretation (see discussion below) or breaches of director's duties to shareholders and creditors than with attacks on the limited liability per se see for example, Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. v. Meyer, [1959] A.C. 324 (H.L.); Sargent, 158 ff. 224 A classic example is Statute ofFrauds, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.19 (any contract for the sale of land that is not in conformity with its writing requirement is unenforceable).

Although these types of provisions may affect the default regime of limited liability, thesejustified redistributions have little to say to the jurist about how limited liability should be understood from a private law perspective. B. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION When one closely examines many of the most oft-cited veil-piercing cases, it becomes clear that a large proportion of them have more to do with statutory interpretation than with the examination of problems sur- rounding corporate law.227 This becomes especially clear when these cases are viewed not from the rubric of what they tell us about the 'legal person' but rather how they interact with the limited liability provided by both the 'D' and 's' contracts. When this change of paradigm is adopted, one thing becomes immediately clear. Since there is in fact not a 'legal person' only a corporate patrimony, the courts are never prohibited from examining the factual circumstances and inner workings of 'the corpora- tion.' Thus, those who have argued that it is illegitimate for the courts to merely 'examine' have been led astray by the traditional incoherent doctrine. When this new view is taken, these judgements can be seen as a combination: (a) in unequal parts of 'letting off steam' by the judiciary, that is obiter dicta, in the face of an unwelcome or difficult legislative intervention22'; (b) and/or a purposive interpretation of a specific statu- tory scheme.2211 Perhaps the most influential of these types of cases can be found in the triumphrate of English cases dealing with the application of narrowly worded expropriation statutes whose compensation varied according to the status of the occupant. In Smith, Stone &amp; Knight Ltd. v. Birmingham,230 D.H.N. Food Distributors Ltd. v. Tower Hamlets L.B.C.,23' and Woolfson v. Strathclyde R.C.,232 the courts were asked to interpret these types of legislative interventions. Typically, under the relevant statutes, less (or nothing) was given to a mere tenant and more to those who were evicted from business premises which they owned. The problem was that in many situations the legal ownership of the property and the business were divided using the corporate form. Thus, on one interpretation of the statute no compensation was to be given to arguably worthy plaintiffs.

Due to the expansive language used, a whole generation of common law cases was needlessly confused as these judicial statements were repeated as general principle rather than being properly confined to their statutory purpose.'"2 While these are the most famous English mistakes, other prominent textbook examples of where English courts, and Commonwealth academic commentators, have mistakenly confused veil-piercing with statutory interpretation can also be found in Daimler Co. Ltd. v. Continental Tyre and Rubber Co. (Great Britain) Ltd.234 and Re F.G. (Films) Ltd.235 Unfortunately, there are also many examples of these over-broad statutory interpretation cases from a Canadian perspective. For example, in De Salaberry Realties Ltd. v. M.N.R.2" the court was charged with prop- erly interpreting the Canadian Tax Act to see if a sale of land should be deemed a 'capital gain' (with concomitant large tax savings) or as 'in- come.' In trying to reach a proper decision on the basis of the statute, the court examined the relationship of the groups of companies to interpret whether or not, on all the evidence, the business of the subsidiary was that of a trader in land. In the end, the court came to the conclusion that the subsidiary was trading in land and that because the property sold was 'inventory,' the proper characterization of the proceeds was as 'income.' Rather than just basing his decision on 'the course of conduct' of which he had 'no doubt,'2"37 the judge went on for pages justifying his piercing of the corporate veil on other tax and statutory cases which spoke of the lack of separate will or agency of the subsidiary.238 The subsequent debate 233 Although much incoherence was caused by these pronouncements, the English courts have now come to see the case in a manner similar to the private law model. See Adams v. Cape Industries plc, [1990] Ch. 433 (C.A.) at 536 [hereinafter Adams] ('The relevant parts of the judgements in the D.H.N. case must, we think ... be regarded as decisions on the relevant statutory provisions for compensation, even though these parts were somewhat broadly expressed....') or Yukong Line Ltd. v.

Beyond this example, Canadian law is full of cases that are sometimes cited as dealing with veil-piercing but which instead are just examples of statutory inter- pretation. Some of these cases include Palmolive Mfg. Co. (Ontario) Ltd. v. The King,24o Toronto (City of) v. Famous Players Canadian Corporation Ltd.,241 Aluminum Co. of Canada v. Toronto,242 ReJodrey's Estatev. Nova Scotia,243 and Nedco Ltd. v. Clark.244 Once again, when these statutory cases are re- examined one finds that they say little about traditional veil-piercing in non-statutory settings and nothing about how to understand the regime of limited liability.245 C. FRAUD OR 'MERE FACADE' Much like the other categories of veil-piercing, this area has been hopelessly confused by the incoherence of our current corporate law doctrine. As Professor Farrar argues, even in the classic framework the use of such language as fraud or facade 'does little more than imply a value judgement of disapprobation. Most cases are in fact examples of fraud in the broadest sense. Beyond this they represent an inarticulate attempt to mark the limits of legitimate incorporation.'246 When the classic cases in this category are examined from the point of view of how they effect limited liability, however, one immediately notices how little they actually have to say on the matter. While they may constitute veil- piercing on the mistaken expansive view, when viewed from the private law model's perspective they are really nothing more than the proper enforcement or interpretation of contracts.247 239 See Cases &amp; Material, supra note 40 at 191-3. 240 [1933] S.C.R. 131. 241 Supra note 41 (profit gained through dividend from subsidiaries is business income for the purposes of municipal taxation statute). 242 Supra note 238 (income of subsidiaries is business income for the purposes of municipal taxation statute). 243 [1980] 2 S.C.R. 744 (shareholders of parent company considered successors of bequeathed estate due to. its factual control of subsidiary). 244 Supra note 30 (striking workers allowed to picket subsidiary's premise on basis of relevant legislation). 245 For a similar view, see Goddard, supra note 35 at 61. 246 Farrar's, supra note 40 at 72 [citations omitted]. 247 This is consistent with the opinion of Cooke, supra note 43, who argues that these cases do not violate the principle of Salomon v. Salomon.</page><page sequence="48">220 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL Of all the veil-piercing cases in this category, perhaps Gilford Motor Home Co. Ltd. v. Homne is the most famous.248 In that case, the plaintiff company employed Horne as its managing director. In his contract of service there was a non-solicitation clause that was to prevent Horne from interfering with, or endeavouring to entice away, any of the company's customers post-contract.249 After resigning from the company, Horne sent circulars and incorporated a company to carry on a competing business. Horne was then employed as the new company's de facto managing director. In the order to reach his decision, Lord Hansworth argued that the company was a 'mere cloak or sham' designed to allow Horne to defeat the covenant. To stop this breach the learned judge therefore issued injunctions against both Horne and the new company. Thus, this case came to stand for the proposition that the court may pierce the veil when the company is a 'sham' or 'fraud.'210 When viewed from the perspective of the private law model, this case really has nothing to do with either narrow veil-piercing or violations of limited liability. The analysis is straightforward. Horne promised not to compete or solicit. He formed a similar company and acted as its managing director. What was he doing if not competing? There is no doubt that he was violating the covenant. This conclusion flows even if a traditional view of the corporation is taken and is irresistible if the corporation is seen as merely a patrimony of assets and liabilities.2"' In order to stop the ongoing breach, the court needed to issue an injunction against Horne that required him to stop having any managerial control of the company or committing any other act that would breach the contract. The injunc- tion on the company can be justified, on the private law model, as serving as a surrogate for an injunction on Horne's wife and accomplices, who were knowingly assisting him in his breach. Thus, the private law model shows the 'foundational' case of 'veil-piercing' to have been just an example of a properly interpreted contract followed by a well-formulated remedy for its breach. Another case of 'veil-piercing' that shows much of the fraud category to be little more than contractual interpretation is Big Bend Hotel Ltd. v. Security Mutual Casualty Co.252 In that case, the corporation entered into an insurance contract for a hotel it owned. The hotel subsequently burned to the ground. The insurance company raised as a defence the fact that the corporation did not disclose a material risk. In this case, the 248 [1933] Ch. 935 (C.A.). 249 Ibid. at 935-6. 250 See Jones v.

Since all insurance contracts depend on 'utmost good faith' and because failure to disclose a material risk renders the contract void, the conclusion must be reached that the contract was void on the issue of material risk.2Y Yet, in order to reach his conclusion that the insurance company did not have to pay, the judge 'pierced the corporate veil' in order to say that the corporation had to disclose the presence of Kumar as a material risk. Once the private law model is employed, the need and the temptation to confuse the issue of contractual interpreta- tion with the use of veil-piercing terminology are gone. The answer is simple. On the proper interpretation of the insurance contract the directors should have disclosed, as a material risk, the fact that Kumar was president. The interposition of the corporate patrimony does not change this fact. Furthermore, the fact that the insurance policy was held void does not affect the limited liability of either the directors or share- holders as they are not now personally liable for the damage to the hotel. Shareholders are only responsible for the loss to the extent of their contribution to the corporate patrimony. Beyond this example, there are many others cases, such as Saskatchewan Economic Development Corp. v. Patterson-Boyd Mfg. Corp.,254 Creasey v. Breachwood Motors Ltd.,255 Harold Holdsworth &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Caddies,256 and Manley Inc. v. Fallis,257 that are more properly understood as instances of contractual interpretation where the courts have confused the true basis of their intervention because of the incoherent doctrine and veil-piercing terminology. While this 'mere interpretation' view of the aforementioned 'fraud' cases is coming to be seen as orthodox in the United Kingdom, what gives this section any real significance is that the English courts'25 and its leading textbook25D' have all come to the conclusion that 'mere facade' (i.e., where assets are removed from a corporate patrimony to deny creditors an effective remedy in either equity or common law) is the only 'real' exception to the Salomon principle under which the courts are occasionally permitted to pierce the corporate veil.21 253 See Corporate Law, supra note 8 at 121-2. 254 [1981] 6 Sask.

Payne, 'Lifting The Corporate Veil: A Reassessment of the Fraud Exception' (1997) 56 C.L.J. 284.</page><page sequence="50">222 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL A classic example of this occurred in Jones v. Lipman.261 In that case, Lipman agreed to sell a parcel of land to the plaintiff. Sometime after the contractwas made Lipman changed his mind and transferred the land to a corporation to defeat any action for specific performance. In order to undo this fraud, the court 'pierced the corporate veil' and ordered a decree of specific performance on both the transferee corporation and Lipman. Thus, the 'mere facade' category of veil-piercing was regularized. When these facts are examined using the private law model, it be- comes clear that this case is no different from the other contractual interpretation and enforcement cases. In other words, it has absolutely nothing to do with violating the limited liability of any corporate actor. On all the facts the court came to the conclusion that Lipman was in effective control of the property, and therefore, that an order of specific performance would be valid against him because he had effective means to carry out the order.262 Furthermore, even if the corporate patrimony had not been under Lipman's control, the court might have nullified the hurtful action by attacking or rescinding the deal as a fraudulent convey- ance263 and then issuing the specific performance order.264 Thus, the private law model replicates the court's conclusion that specific perfor- mance cannot be defeated in this manner without the 'unnecessary mysticism' given by the court for the second specific performance order.265 Furthermore, this reasoning shows that there is nothing more to the 'mere facade' category than the proper enforcement of a contract. In any event, it also shows that the limited liability of the shareholders and directors of the transferee corporation would not have been touched. Another example of this type of fact pattern can be found in the recent decision of Yukong Line Ltd. v. Rendsberg Investment Corp. (No. 2).266 The facts of this case can be summarized in the following manner. The plaintiff brought an action against Y, and companies R Co. and L Co., of which Y was the ultimate beneficial owner and a director. The plaintiff had made a charter-party contract with R Co. through Y acting as its agent. Soon after it was made R Co. repudiated the contract due to a 261 Supra note 250. 262 Gower's, supra note 9 at 171 ('specific performance cannot be resisted by a vendor who has absolute ownership and control of the company in which the land is vested'); Mayson, supra note 35 at 135. 263 See Fraudulent Conveyances Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29, s.2 ('Every conveyance of real property or personal property ... made with intent to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties or forfeitures are void as against such persons and their assigns.'). 264 Ottolenghi, supra note 34 at 351. 265 Mayson, supra note 35 at 135. 266 Supra note 233.</page><page sequence="51">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 223 change in market conditions. On the day of the repudiation all the funds from the bank account of R Co. were transferred to L Co. Then, R Co.'s bank account was subsequently closed. In light of the facts, the plaintiff made three arguments for recovery from Y: agency, veil-piercing, and conspiracy. In response to the agency argument, the court found that it was impossible to hold that Y was the principal and R Co. was his agent given that the contract explicitly stated the opposite. Furthermore, the court denied any general applicability of the Smith, Stone &amp; Knight test.267 In response to the veil-piercing argument and after reviewing the authori- ties, the court held that there was nothing in the transfer that would render Y liable for the charter-party contract. No veil-piercing case stood for this proposition of substitution, as opposed to their use as a means of interpretation. Since all had agreed that R Co. should be charged with the liability for damages, the court held that is how things should remain. In response to the third argument, that Y and other associates had directly conspired to defraud the plaintiffs of their remedy, the court argued that in order for there to be an action for conspiracy, the underly- ing unlawful act must be actionable by the plaintiff. In this case, while Y had breached his fiduciary duty and thereby harmed the position of the creditors, he did not owe the fiduciary duties directly to them; rather, such duties were mediated through the company. The claim of the plaintiff on this count therefore also failed. Responding to the argument that a lack of remedy in these circumstances might show the law in an unfavourable light, the court suggested that there might be two remedies available.2"8 The first remedy suggested was the appointment of a liquadator for R Co. When this had occurred, the court argued that Y would have no answer to a claim brought by the liquadator for breach of his fiduciary duty. Therefore, when the money was paid back into the corporate patrimony, the plaintiffs would receive full payment through this process as they were the only creditors. The second remedy suggested by the court was that it might have used its inherent powers to issue injunctions to require Y to use his position of dominance in L Co. 'to get back from himself that which he had caused to be paid for his benefit.'2"'M But since either side did not argue this, the court would not impose such a remedy of its own motion. Once again we have a situation where the court almost comes to the right conclusion but is misled by the traditional doctrine into refraining from doing that which it clearly thinks is right. 267 Yukong, supra note 233 at 303-4. 268 Ibid. at 314-5. 269 Ibid. at 314.</page><page sequence="52">224 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL On application of the private law model, we can see both what the court got right and how the case should have been dealt with. Clearly, the court was correct in asserting that the facts did not warrant the principal- agent analysis as between R Co. and Y. Furthermore, the court was also correct in denying the veil-piercing remedy. The agreement between Y and the plaintiff clearly contemplated that the plaintiff would look solely to R's corporate patrimony. They had agreed to a limited recourse term and should be held to their promise. It is submitted, however, that there are two coherent solutions to this fact pattern. The first of these is to attack the transaction as fraudulent, rescind the transfer, and replenish the corporate patrimony. When this is done, all parties would receive their proper compensation provided that the money can be found. The second solution, which is especially effective when the money cannot be returned, is to allow a suit directly against the director for breach of his fiduciary duty. If the private law model is correct, Y also promised the plaintiff that as R Co.'s director he would maximize the NPV of the patrimony with care and loyalty. Instead, he stole the money in breach of this duty. Therefore, Y is liable to the creditors and must compensate each of them according to their loss. The only reason the court is confused is that of the incoherent doctrine of 'legal person.'270 It is contended that this dual analysis based on rescinding fraudulent convey- ances and allowing creditors to enforce the NPV promise effectively deals with these cases and others such as McFadden v. 481782 Ontario Ltd.,271 Einhorn v. Westmount Investments Ltd.,272 and Garbutt Business College Ltd. v. Henderson and Henderson Secretarial School Ltd.,27 where the courts have been forced to retreat into veil-piercing or the tort of inducing breach of contract in order to do justice. What should be remembered, however, is that this analysis shows that any damages or court orders comprehended by the private law model here are not unjustified interventions that eviscerate limited liability but rather examples of natural persons, in this case directors, being held accountable for their contractual breach or personal fault. 270 What is interesting is that the court is, in fact, complicatedly allowing the creditors to enforce the NPV promise through the appointment of a liquadator to act in their interests. The argument here is that instead of pursuing this circuitous reasoning and legal machinations, the court should simply recognise that in the proper circumstances creditors can enforce the 'D' contract. 271 (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 134 (H.C.J.). 272 (1969), 6 D.L.R. (3d) 71 (Sask. Q.B.). 273 [1939] 3 W.W.R. 257 (Alta. C.A.).</page><page sequence="53">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 225 D. AGENCY Clearly, as we saw in Part I, the current thinking on agency as a means of veil-piercing is grossly inadequate for the following three reasons: first there is disagreement over whether or not agency, as currently applied, actually constitutes veil-piercing; second the logical inconsistency of as- serting that the corporation is both a puppet, under the complete control of another, while simultaneously being an independent legal actor who can enter into binding agency agreements;274 and third the majority of cases traditionally dealt with under agency are most likely mere instances of statutory interpretation. In light of these problems the issue will be examined de novo from the perspective of the private law model. When this is done the question becomes: 'Can a group of con- tracts (consistent with 's' and 'D') be arranged so that we can say the corporate patrimony behaved as ifit was an agent?' When this question is posed, the issues are two-fold: (1) Can the directors be agents for a shareholder? (2) Can the directors pledge the patrimony so that it is charged as if it were a partner? In response to the first issue, the private law model of the corporation provides a clear answer. Since the contract between the directors and the shareholders is one of 'non-agency' it will be very difficult on any set of facts to find an implied contract of agency. As Justice Toulson argued in Yukong, an implied contract of agency between the directors and the shareholders is highly suspect since the 'the intention of someone who conducts trading activities through the vehicle of a one-man company will be quite the opposite.'275 In other words, since an explicit contract of non-agency is one of the central characteristics of the corporate contract, it is entirely inconsistent with the idea of the corporation to find that the intention of the parties was something different. If the court concludes that there was in fact a contract of agency, then the parties will not have created a 'corporation' but perhaps some other legal relationship, most probably some form of partnership. While this conclusion may seem harsh, it must be remembered that this analysis only holds for property that is actually transferred and administered by the directors as part of the corporate patrimony. It might be possible that the business of the corporate patrimony could be the administration of property for others. Thus, although the directors would be 'non-agents' for the 'corporate property' in which the share- holder has an undivided share, the same director might then agree to administer, as agent, some separately-owned and distinct property (i.e., non- 274 See Ottolenghi, supra note 34 at 339. 275 Yukong, supra note 233 at 304.</page><page sequence="54">226 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL corporate property) of a shareholder as part of the company's business. Thus, if the shareholder agreed only to look at the corporate patrimony for indemnity for breach of the contract, it would appear as if the cor- porate patrimony were someone's agent. The case that comes closest to emulating these facts is that of Smith, Stone &amp; Knight. In that case the principle shareholder acquired a partnership and transferred its adminis- tration to the corporation of which it was a shareholder. The title to the business remained with the shareholder and was never transferred to the corporate patrimony.27" Furthermore, no shares were taken as a result of the transfer, and the directors of the corporate patrimony administered this property for the shareholder. Since the directors were acting as the agents of the principle shareholder in respect of that property, that shareholder would be liable on normal agency principles for anyjural act performed by his agents in that property's administration. However, it must be remembered that the shareholder would not be liable qua shareholder but rather qua principle. His, her, or its liability would be no different from that of any other person entering into such "an arrange- ment and is justified on elementary common law principles. This brings us to the second question: 'Could directors enter into limited recourse contracts of partnership or 'mutual agency' with directors of other corporate patrimonies so that it appeared that these distinct companies were charged with obligations as if they were a part- nership?' While such a complex structure is possible, there would of course be legal constraints on this type of analysis. The most important of these is that the directors would be constrained in their ability to enter into these types of agreements by their promise to administer the patrimony in a way that maximized its NPV. Depending on the circum- stances, it might be difficult to prove that exposing the complete assets of the corporate patrimony was value maximizing, especially when passive investment as a limited partner or the incorporation of ajoint venture is an available option. That being said, in the appropriate circumstance, a 'partnership' of corporate patrimonies might be the proper interpreta- tion. The fact pattern that comes closest to exemplifying this type of arrangement can be found in the aforementioned D.H.N. Food case.277 In that case, the business of the group was divided between three corporate patrimonies. The real estate was held by Pl, the trucks were owned by P2 and the rest of the business assets were held by p3. While it is far from clear that the interlocking directors had pledged their respective patri- 276 This is often seen as the key to the result, see Mayson, supra note 35 at 132; Corporate Law, supra note 8 at 131. 277 Coporate Law, supra note 8 at 135-6 shares this opinion.</page><page sequence="55">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 227 monies into a contract of mutual agency, Lord Denning came close to stating as much. He argued: 'This group is virtually a partnership in which all three companies are partners. They should not be treated separately so as to be defeated on a technical point.'278 But if the out- come of this characterization is examined from the standpoint of the limited liability of shareholders, one finds that it really does not make them liable for anything more than their original investment(s) in the corporate patrimony(ies). The only material fact that has changed is that there is a substantial increase in the likelihood that their investment will be dissipated in a failed business venture. Yet, once again, we see that this has more to do with director liability to the shareholders for breaches of the 'D' contract than with traditional veil-piercing. In sum, while it is clear that in extremely rare circumstances directors may both become agents of shareholders for the administration of non- corporate property, and pledge the corporate patrimony into a partner- ship, neither of these affects the limited liability of a shareholder in that capacity. In response to the first situation, the shareholder is entering into a legal relationship that engages his liability solely because of her status as principal. Her liability is no more or no less than any other person entering into a contract of agency. In response to the second situation, the liability of the shareholder for the debts of the company is not in any way increased. E. TORT For many years Canadian courts have been using tort principles to hold corporate agents responsible for their actions. This process is so well entrenched that the Ontario Court of Appeal stated unanimously that the 'consistent line of authority in Canada holds simply that, in all events, officers, directors and employees of corporations are responsible for their tortious conduct even though that conduct was directed in a bona fide manner to the best interests of the company.'271" Yet, whether or not this area of law is characterized as traditional 'veil-piercing,' some commentators have come to recognize that tort liability may pose a threat to the separate legal person principle epitomized by Salomon v.

Examples of this type of process can be seen in the decisions of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Trevor Ivory Ltd. v. Anderson,28' the recent House of Lords decision in Williams v. Natural Life Health Foods Ltd.,282 and inJustice La Forest's dissent in London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuehne &amp; NagelInternational Ltd.28" Thus, there seems to be a tension in the law between those cases emphasizing the principles of tort and those that try to effect the policies of corporate law, as they are currently interpreted. Beyond this tension, there is also confusion engendered in this area by the line of cases dealing with the primary liability of a corporation through the rather mystical 'directing mind and will' process. This 'identification' group of cases, which have for many years run on a parallel path to the others, has nonetheless occasionally confused the issues involved by speaking of the directors as the 'organs' or 'ego' of the company.284 The argument of this section will be that when these three groups of cases are examined from a private law perspective, one can see that there is in fact no conflict between them. In the cases where direc- tors and shareholders have been held liable there are justifiable reasons for this; namely, that the participants have committed a fault that renders them liable to make reparation. Likewise, the private law model can also coherently explain why liability has in some cases been limited to, or imposed solely upon, the corporate patrimony. In order to explain coherently these three lines of cases, it is first necessary to clear up some common misconceptions about the application of tort principles in the corporate context produced by the misuse of the 'organ' theory of the company. This theory, still popular among many judges and academics, posits that once liability is attributed to the separate legal person through the actions of its 'vital organs,' the constituent directors are somehow 'wash- ed' clean of legal responsibility.285 As Professors Bonham and Soberman explain: [T]he most important body, the one that governs the corporation from day to day and makes the major business decisions, the board of directors, is likened to the head, the controlling organ. The actions of the board then become not 281 [1992] 2 N.Z.L.R. 517 (C.A.) [hereinafter Trevor Ivory]. 282 [1998] 1 W.L.R. 830 (H.L.)

This subsidiary branch of the realist theory, was accepted by English courts early in the present century, and has not been seriously doubted since then. In fact the theory has been refined to the extent that acts of key officers whom the court considers the true controllers of the company, have been accepted as acts of the company itself.28" The implicit reasoning is that if the corporation is primarily liable through the rules of attribution then the directors cannot also be pri- marily liable. While this reasoning may be generally plausible if the 'legal person' metaphor is stretched to its limits, once the corporation is understood as being an empty shell, a patrimony to which we factually charge monetary liabilities and assets, one can properly understand the relationship of this group of cases to the private law liability of corporate agents. When the matter is re-examined, one finds that this conclusion as to directors 'being' the company, was based on a reading of cases where judges had to interpret statutory language, most often in the context of imposing criminal or regulatory liability.287 With this realized, these cases interact with the common law in the following manner. Clearly, for reasons of public policy, the legislator may want to charge the corporate patrimony directly with liability for the acts done by its corporate agents/employees as if the corporate patrimony had committed the acts itself. Moreover, for policy reasons the legislator may also wish to waive its right to pursue the natural persons involved in the corporate enterprise for the same statutory offence. When this is intended by the legislator, the courts, through statutory interpretation, will of course have to choose whose actions will 'count' to satisfy the legislator's intention to charge the corporate patrimony, as well as who should be forgiven. This is bound to be a major task of the courts given that corporate law is becoming increasingly more regulated and complex, and that the Interpretation Act88 informs us both that any statutory reference to the word "person,' or any word or expression descriptive of a person, includes a corpora- tion';2893 and that any statutory language dealing with a corporation is to 286 D. Bonham &amp; D. Soberman, 'The Nature of Corporate Personality' in Studies in Canadian Company Law, vol. 1,J. S. Zeigel, ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1967) 3 at 12. 287 See for example, The 'Rhone'v. The 'PeterA.B. Widener,' [1993] 1 S.C.R. 497; Canadian Diedge &amp; Dock Co. Ltd. v. The Queen, [ 1985] 1 S.C.R. 662; Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co.

As was pointed out by the Privy Council in Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd. v. Securities Commission: 'This is always a matter of interpretation: given that it [the provision] was intended to apply to a company, how was it intended to apply? Whose act (or knowledge or state of mind) was for this purpose intended to count as the act etc. of the company?'291 When this attribution process is correctly viewed as a statutory exercise, there is no need to personify the company generally throughout the private law, through the device of the 'directing mind and will.' Furthermore, as Lord Hoffmann warned, to analogize a company fully with a natural person, as has been done by the 'organ' school, is dangerous because 'this anthropomorphism, by the very power of the image, distracts attention from the very purposes for which ... the notion of directing mind and will [is used], namely to apply the attribu- tion rule derived' from the specific statutory rule in question.2'2 Thus, outside of this field of statutory interpretation, such anthropomorphism is useless and misleading further confusing issues by implying moral and physical presence to the inanimate corporate patrimony. When a view similar to Lord Hoffmann or the private law model is taken, it can be seen that the fact of statutory 'attribution' and 'forgive- ness' is in no way a general principle that somehow gives directors, shareholders, or employees carte blanche private law immunity for their actions while participating in the corporate contract. For example, while a statute may impose criminal liability on A. Salomon &amp; Co. Ltd. if Mr. Salomon, its directing mind and will, had intended to kill his clerk by running him down with the company car, it does immunize Mr. Salo- mon, as director, from a claim by the same clerk that he negligently drove over him while on company business. As one author has stated: 'Mr. Salomon could not say 'I was not me at the time, I was incorpo- rated.' So victims of torts by real people can still sue those real people - they can disregard the presence of a company [patrimony] if they so wish.'21" Similarly, the shareholders of a company will be in the same position as the directors; if they have committed a tort they will also be 290 Ibid. at 21(1) (d). 291 Supra note 134 at 419. 292 Ibid. at 421. 293 Goddard, supra note 35 at 35. For a similar view see, Thompson, supra note 52 at 8 &amp; 'Endless,' supra note 184 at 663.</page><page sequence="59">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 231 held liable. Thus, as David Goddard argues in his tribute to Salomon v. Salomon: In general, we can say that a person's civil liability for acting wrongfully in person, in breach of non-voluntary obligations imposed by the general law will not be reduced by the presence of a corporate entity.... If that individual is the owner of the company, or if the owner is a party to the tort (i.e. had directed or procured it), limited liability is irrelevant - the owner is fully liable.294 With the attribution misconception disposed of we can move on to examine the more difficult and controversial fact patterns that touch directly on the issue of private law liability. In these types of situations, the Commonwealth case law, as we have seen, seemingly divides into a 'tort approach' epitomized by such cases as Wolfe v. Moir and B.G. Preeco, where tortious liability is more readily imposed and a 'corporate ap- proach' epitomized by the decisions in both Trevor Ivory and Williams. The task here is to see if these seemingly disparate decisions, which all have some intuitive appeal on their facts, can be reconciled through the application of the private law model to show why liability is justifiably imposed in one set of circumstances and not imposed in another. The argument of this section is that private rules can explain this division of approaches. In order to accomplish this task, this paper will examine the 'corporate approach' cases first. Upon examination the facts, issues, and reasoning of both the New Zealand and the English courts in the Williams and Trevor Ivory cases were essentially similar. In both cases, the central issue was whether or not the directors of a company could be held personally liable for the financial losses caused by the negligent advice of 'the company' in which they were directors. In Williams, the loss was caused by a defective franchisee prospectus that promised higher returns than were actually enjoyed by the appellants. In Trevor Ivory, the loss was caused by mistaken advice about pesticide that led to the destruction of an entire crop of raspberry bushes. In both cases, the companies were essentially one-man operations with the directors comprising the management and principal sharehold- ers. The only major difference between the two cases was that, in Trevor Ivory, the director provided the advice personally and had had extensive dealings with the complainants, whereas in Williams the plaintiffs dealt directly with an employee of the company and only sued the director after the company was wound up. Both the New Zealand Court of Appeal and House of Lords ruled that since there was no 'assumption of respon- 294 Goddard, supra note 35 at 36.</page><page sequence="60">232 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL sibility' by the directors for the advice of their companies, the directors could not be personally liable. Both aggrieved parties had to look solely to the corporation for the satisfaction of their claims. Although both courts' language is couched in the misguided 'legal person' doctrine, the argument here will be that on the private law model they both come to the correct conclusion. One can hear the objections of the unconverted already: 'Hold on, above you argued that there is no such thing as a legal person? The whole argument has been that there is only a corporate patrimony and therefore that natural persons are responsible for their delictual fault. How is this situation different from any other tort case? Since there is no 'legal person' to rely on, the aggrieved parties in both these cases must have been relying on the advice of someone. Who else could it be besides the director, who must be liable? How can you argue that these cases are correctly decided? Either you follow the private law model and argue that these cases are wrongly decided, or you abandon the private law model!' While these assertions are not without merit, they can be responded to in two ways. In response to the factual circumstances of Williams, it can be argued that this case is correctly decided on ordinary misrepresentation and tort principles. From the facts it is not clear that the appellants actually relied on the director in any real way. As was stated by Lord Steyn: In the present case there were no personal dealings between Mr. Mistlin [the director] and the plaintiffs. There was no exchanges or conduct crossing the line, which could have conveyed to the plaintiffs that Mr. Mistlin was willing to assume personal responsibility to them. ... I am also satisfied that there is not even evidence that the plaintiffs believed that Mr. Mistlin was undertaking personal responsibility to them. Certainly, there is nothing in the circumstances to show that the plaintiffs could reasonably have looked to Mr. Mistlin for indemnification of any loss.295 In other words, in suing the director, the plaintiffs sued the wrong person! Clearly the courts will not hold people liable for the torts they did not actually commit. In this case, since the plaintiffs did not rely on the director and cannot legally rely on an inanimate object,2!6 they must 295 Williams, supra note 282 at 838. 296 But see contra La Forest J's decisions in London Drugs, supra note 138 and Edgeworth Construction Ltd. v. D. N. Lea &amp; Associates Ltd., [1993] 3 S.C.R. 206 [hereinafter Edgeworth], where he argues primarily on policy that it is possible for a natural person to be said to have relied on a group of funds: 'While they may, in one sense, have expected that persons in the position of the appellant would rely on their work, they would expect that the appellant would place reliance on their firm's pocketbook and</page><page sequence="61">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 233 have relied on the employee with whom they had had almost exclusive contact. In this sense, the outcome of the House of Lords decision is an example of the private law model's thesis that liability will only be imposed on directors or shareholders for the same reasons that it is imposed on others. In this case the answer is quite simple: no reliance, no liability. The response of the naysayer to this might involve something along these lines: 'You have merely picked an easy case! Anybody can see why the director is not liable in Williams, but how can you explain the non- liability of the employee (if he was sued) or of the "hands-on" director in Trevor Ivory? On tort principles, which the private law model posits apply generally, these types of directors and employees must be liable if they were relied upon!' While this is the proper solution when the analysis is based solely upon pure tort analysis, it must be remembered that there is more going on here than merely tort. In these types of situations there was also a contract that allocated risk between the parties. Thus, the solu- tion to these problems lies in a proper interpretation of the contract en- tered into by the directors on behalf of the corporate patrimony. In other words, what mutual promises did the participants in Trevor Ivory make? In the Trevor Ivory and Williams cases, the fact that the courts are focussing on an 'assumption of responsibility' is their way of saying that the director did not assume financial responsibility for a negligent breach of his legal duty. The only way that such a state of affairs can occur, however, is through contract.297 In Trevor Ivory the court must be saying that while Mr. Ivory would otherwise have been responsible, the plaintiff farmers contracted to look solely to the corporate patrimony for any indemnification occasioned by a breach of the duty of care. In this sense, the parties have entered into a contract with a limited or non-recourse term no different than one that stated 'my liability is limited to $10,000 for negligence, absent dishonesty or fraud.'298 When there are concur- rent contractual and delictual obligations, the analysis is simple - tort not theirs for indemnification.' The problem is that I do not think it is possible in law to detrimentally rely on anything but the professional advice or services of a natural person. The fact that one may reasonably rely stems from the status of the speaker not the size of their bank account. As was reiterated by IacobucciJ., for the majority in the same case London Drugs, supra note 138 at 336, when reliance is used in tort cases 'it is concerned with the relationship between the plaintiffs position and the tortfeasor's conduct, not with the relationship between the plaintiff's position and the tortfeasor's pocket-book.' Thus, the better interpretation of these types of situations is the one offered here - that the parties have agreed to look only at the corporate patrimony for the financial losses occasioned by breach. 297 See Iacobucci J. in London Drugs, supra note 138 at 336. 298 Goddard, supra note 35 at 47.</page><page sequence="62">234 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL liability cannot be used to circumvent arrangements agreed to through contract.2"9 As was stated by the Supreme Court of Canada, 'tort liability in a case such as this falls to be assessed in a contractual matrix. The parties planned obligations must be given pre-eminence. Where those planned obligations negate tort liability, contract "trumps" tort.' 00 David Goddard has made this same point in relation to the Trevor Ivory case: The Andersons [the plaintiffs] were voluntary creditors of the company. They knew who they were dealing with ... The Andersons were simply trying to use tort to improve their contractual bargain, to set aside the limited recourse term which applied by virtue of contracting with the company. But there is absolutely no ground, from a legal or economic perspective, for permitting the contract to be rewritten in this way. The limited recourse term is just like an exclusion clause: and the courts have repeatedly held that claims based on concurrent liability should not be and cannot be used to get around such clauses.3"1 The only reason that this analysis is confused in the cases is that of the interposition of 'legal person' and director-corporation identification doctrines,302 which fortunately reach solutions in these situations that are similar to the conclusions of the private law model. The only controversial question that arises out of this analysis is whether such a non-recourse term is to be necessarily implied into all service contracts entered into by corporate agents on behalf of the corporate patrimony? While this issue is debatable, the answer to the question is most likely 'yes.'808 As Lord Cooke argued in Trevor Ivory: I commit myself to the opinion that, when he formed his company, Mr. Ivory made it plain to the world that limited liability was intended. Possibly the plaintiffs gave little thought to that in entering into the consultancy contract; but such a limitation is a common fact of business and ... the consequences should in my view be accepted in the absence of special circumstances.:314 299 See Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147; Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. [1995] 2 AC 145 (H.L.). 300 Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. (1997) 153 D.L.R.

Company legislation typically provides for 'notice and publicity of the fact that a company is under a limited liability regime; customers and creditors are thereby put on notice that in ordinary circumstances they can only look to the company for the satisfaction of their claims.31s As was stated before, when a corporate agent signs on behalf of 'x Ltd.' she has financially bound the corporate patrimony in return for a promise by the creditor that he will execute only against that fund should the relevant promise be breached. Any other interpretation would seem- ingly defeat the purpose of the whole transaction. Thus, when the fact of limited liability is publicized and known to each party, the non-recourse term is implied as an 'instinct with obligation' to give effect to the parties' intentions."": The only 'exception,' of course, would be where the parties' words and deeds clearly demonstrated that a different out- come was intended, such as where they intended the concurrent or sole financial liability of the director. It is contended that this type of contract- tort reasoning easily explains the outcome in the Williams, Trevor Ivory, and London Drugs, as well as such problematic misrepresentation cases as Sealand of the Pacific v. Robert C. McHaffe Ltd.307 and Edgeworth Construction Ltd. v. D. N. Lea &amp; Associates Ltd.308 After having reached this conclusion the only difficulty that remains is to show how the private law model's solution interacts with seemingly contradictory 'tort approach' cases. The first of these difficult cases is the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Wolfe v. Moir.3o' In that case, the plaintiff was injured while roller skating at a rink owned by Chinook Sport Shop Ltd. The primary share- holder of the company was Mr. Moir, a former recreation director of the local town. When advertisements were made on the radio the rink was referred to as Moir's Sports Land; when they were made in the paper the rink was known as Moir's Sports Land (Fort Whoop-up). On the ticket purchased by the plaintiff, the Fort Whoop-up name was used. Mr. Moir was aware that people identified him with the rink in their minds and he cultivated this impression. Furthermore, none of the documents con- 305 Supra note 138 at 289. 306 See Sinclair v. Purdy, 235 N.Y. 245 (C.A. 1923) at 254 (per Cardozo J.)

Justice Sinclair rendered decision for the plaintiffs against Mr. Moir on the basis that corporate formalities had failed to be compiled with. Can the private law model explain this decision against the director in light of the implied non-recourse term? The answer to this case is that, viewed objectively, the non-recourse term was not intended by both of the parties. What was intended was a contract between the plaintiff and Mr. Moir (operating as the proprietor of Sports Land) which in no way limited his personal liability. The facts that no effort was made to publi- cize the 'Ltd.' nature of the corporation especially on the ticket, and that Mr. Moir cultivated the impression that he was operating Fort Whoop-Up as his personal business, leads to the conclusion that he had made a representation of unlimited liability. As the learned judge argued: where 'a person chooses to advertise and to hold himself out to the public without identifying the name of the company ... he runs the risk of being held personally responsible.'310 Since Mr. Moir did not make any effort to publicize the limited nature of his business, there is no way that non- recourse interpretation can be implied to the situation. In this case, much like Chaing v. Heppner," Vulcan Iron Works v. Leary,"' Corkum v. Lohnes,"13 Gelhorn Motors Ltd. v. Yee,314 Royal Stores Ltd. v. Brown,"'" and Trial Tire Service Ltd. v. Scobie, "" liability was justifiably imposed on the one party for these unlimited liability representations. Another difficult case, which might seem to cast doubt upon the non- recourse interpretation, is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in B.G. Preeco.317 In that case, the plaintiffs entered into negotia- tions to sell real estate to Bon Street Developments (BSD1). Unbeknownst to the plaintiffs the directors, K and M, fraudulently caused the corpora- tion twice to change its name and become Bon Street Holdings. K and M then immediately incorporated a new company called Bon Street Devel- opments (BSD2) to enter into the contract. The new company, BSD2, then entered into the land contract with the plaintiff. BSD2 subsequently defaulted and, at trial, the plaintiff received judgements against both the corporation, BSD2, for breach of contract and K and M for damages in the tort of deceit. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision. 310 Wolfev. Moir, supra note 132 at 71. 311 (1978), 85 D.L.R. (3d) 487 at 493-494 (B.C. Co. Ct.). 312 (1905), 1 W.L.R. 453 (Man.

Ct.). 317 Supra note 132.</page><page sequence="65">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 237 In light of this decision it can be asked how this case squares with the non-recourse interpretation of the Williams and Trevor Ivory cases re- viewed above? There are two ways to answer this question. The first answer is to simply say that the non-recourse clause is not intended to apply to fraudulent, as opposed to negligent or innocent, breaches of duties.3'" The second interpretation is to say that the plaintiffs are being held to their original non-recourse agreement but that this agreement is being given effect by the damages for the tort of deceit. Phrased differ- ently, the plaintiffs thought they had a non-recourse contract by which they were to look to 'patrimony BSD1' for indemnification for breach. Due to the fraud of K and M they instead received a non-recourse con- tract with patrimony BSD2.31' The difference in the value of the two promises, say 100 dollars, is therefore made up by the fraudulent direc- tors as the damages for the tort of deceit. Therefore, through the application of tort principles both the plaintiffs and the defendants are held to their original bargain.320 But whatever interpretation of this case is taken the private law model can show that the general non-recourse interpretation is respected, while simultaneouslyjustifying the decision of the court. F. VEIL-PIERCING IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL In sum, the analysis in Part III has come to the following conclusion - namely, that the application of the private law model to the veil-piercing cases reveals that nothing strange, exceptional, or unjustified is occurring in this area of law beyond the proper application of well-settled legal principles to the jural relations of those involved in the corporation. Where natural persons are liable under the general private law rules, the courts are simply imposing this liability.32' Similarly, where the parties involved have contracted in order to shift that liability through non- recourse agreements, the courts are enforcing these contractual terms, as is the general practice. Likewise, where a statute clearly imposes liability irrespective of the corporate contracts, the courts are enforcing these 318 For such a view, see London Drugs, supra note 138 at 317 perLa ForestJ. 319 This is similar to the court's opinion of the nature of the fraud, see B.G. Preeco, supra note 132 at 33-4. 320 The only problem with this analysis is that from reading the case one is not sure if the damages for deceit, some - 400 000 dollars - actually corresponded to what the plaintiffs would have received had the non-recourse contract been with BSD1 rather than with the shell-corporation. 321 This conclusion is mimicked by R.B. Thompson, 'Piercing The Corporate Veil: An Empirical Study' (1991) 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1036 at 1047 (survey of 1 600 American veil-piercing cases reveals no case where liability was imposed on a passive shareholder who had not participated in the wrong alleged).</page><page sequence="66">238 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL statutes as is their duty. Finally, where a statute or contract requires in- terpretation or proper enforcement, the courts are not letting incoher- ent doctrine stand in the way of the legally justified result. What is extremely interesting about this analysis, at least from the perspective of the pragmatic lawyer, is that the private law model proves to be highly predictive. Unlike the current intuitive and ad hoc understand- ing of the cases under which no one seems able to rationalize when a judge will (or will not) hold shareholders or directors liable through the veil-piercing terminology or what quantum of damages he/she will impose, the private law model gives clear guidance on the courts' approach to these questions. As has been borne out by our examination of the cases, the courts will resort to the language of 'piercing the corporate veil' when any general legal obligation has been violated by a natural person in the corporate context and incoherent 'corporate personality' is thought to stand in the way."22 In other words, if x would have been found liable under a general tort, contract, unjust enrichment, or statutory analysis, the court will find them liable through some sort of 'veil-piercing.' Furthermore, these 'veil-piercing' damages or remedies, while often inadequately expressed, will almost always be equivalent to that which is objectively necessary to undo the harm caused by the violation of right. Paradoxically then the private law model proves to be more pragmatic than the current 'pragmatist approach' because it allows the practising lawyer to predict judicial outcomes with reasonable certainty, and thus properly advise clients on when to settle and/or prosecute an action involving claims of veil-piercing and corporate tort. Conclusion In conclusion, this paper has attempted to demonstrate that the princi- ple enunciated in Salomon v. Salomon and adopted into our organizing statutes is not a doctrine worthy of providing the conceptual foundation of Canadian corporate law. In Part I it was argued that reliance on the 'central' principle of the 'separate legal person' renders our current body of corporate law incoherent in two senses. First, it is incoherent in that the principle is directly contradicted by the veil-piercing cases that state the circumstances in which the separate personality may be ignored. 322 For a similar view, see Re Clark's Will 204 Minn. 574 (S.C. 1939) at 578 ('Many cases present avowed disregard of the corporate entity.... But they all come to just this - courts simply will not let interposition of corporate entity or action prevent a judgement otherwise required. Corporate presence and action no more than those of an individual will bar a remedy demanded by law in application to facts.').</page><page sequence="67">CANADIAN CORPORATE LAW 239 Direct contradiction is the worst kind of incoherence. Beyond that Canadian corporate law is incoherent in a second sense because this organizing doctrine fails to adequately explain all of the law over which it claims dominion. In Part II a replacement foundational principle was suggested, namely a private law model of the corporation based on a nexus of jural relations between shareholders, directors, and outside creditors. It was argued that such a theory adequately explains all of the traditional attributes of the corporation and many problematic areas in a coherent fashion. After dealing with objections to the private law model, the explanatory power of the theory was then put to the test in Part III and used to explain the unruly veil-piercing and corporate tort cases as the correct application of traditional private law doctrines within the corporate context disguised in confusing language. Hopefully, this process has demonstrated that once the corporation is properly concep- tualized, it is unnecessary to 'escape from the law' in order to satisfacto- rily analyze complicated factual situations. Finally, for those pragmatic lawyers who remain unconvinced by the forgoing analysis or who may dismiss the private law model as an aca- demic 'flight of fancy,' all I can say is, 'Test it yourself!' Choose any other complicated fact pattern - such as one that invokes the oppression remedy or involves parent-subsidiary relations - and compare the clear and intelligible answers that will be given by the private law model with the divergent 'solutions' provided by the 'practical' black letter law. If you agree that rationality is a goal of the common law and our legal tradition, then ask yourself which explanation of the 'Corporation' and our corporate law best demonstrates the rationality, simplicity, and coherence of these judicial outcomes: the traditional formulation based on 'separate entity' or that given by the private law model? Furthermore, ask yourself which theory more accurately allows you to predict the factual resolutions of future cases (i.e., x wins, with Y solution, justified in z black letter terms)? Since the purpose of any rational inquiry is to provide the simplest coherent explanation of any phenomenon, every lawyer must answer these very material questions before ultimately assessing the worth of any theory of the corporation. In the course of rendering your judgement, do not let history or familiarity cloud your thinking.
