Michael Webb Eight-year-old Bradley Northrup views the robot as an impersonal talking machine. His drawing combines the attributes of the ubiquitous, pushbutton telephone with those of an industrial robot-pincer hands, antennae, unwavering eyes and casters in place of the more traditional metal legs we've come to associate with robots. It is expected that the robot will not. .. "run amok." If the computer malfunctions .. . the robot's technology is intended to allow it to shut down within seconds. Denning Systems, Inc., 1982 I am incapable of making an error. Hal, in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968 True robots are a product of computer technology, but the robot idea has been scaring and inspiring us since the dawn of civilization. Legend and scientific predictions, literature, art and the movies have long colored our perception of robots' appearance, capability and potential. Bradley Northrup, a pragmatic eight-year-old, describes a robot as a talking machine. His kinetic interpretation reflects his youth, for it describes a lively creature, but one that is somewhat less than humanoid. The more traditional popular view of the robot, still held by the vast majority of people, is of a machine-man that possesses super-human capabilities and functions in a technological sphere somewhere between people and machines. The Robot Institute of America defines a robot as "a reprogrammable multi-functional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks." The key word here is reprogrammable; the indispensable component is the computer. Most so-called robots-in theme parks or factories-are, by this definition, mere automatons. They are programmed to perform one set of functions and lack the capability to vary this predictable routine. It is a crucial difference, but, superficially, the automaton may be indistinguishable from a robot. The mythology of robots has been enriched over the centuries by a marvelous collection of imagined machines and monsters, whose capabilities often exceed anything we have today. Myths of human creation have been interwoven with legends of artificial life. In the Bible, God created Adam from dust; in Jewish legend, Rabbi Loew animated the Golem (a formless mass of clay) to protect the Jews of Prague. Pygmalion fell in love with a sculpture of the goddess Aphrodite; he prayed to the goddess to bring him a wife like the statue, and she brought it to life as Galatea. St. Thomas Aquinas is reputed to have smashed a life-size automaton servant, denouncing it as the work of the Devil.</page><page sequence="3">6 w In this sequence of stills from Fritz Lang's 1926 masterpiece, Metropolis, Rotwang says to the girl Maria, "Come, I am going to make the robot look like you." The Industrial Revolution introduced us to a secular devil that still haunts us: the machine as a destructive force, escaping our control and enslaving the human race. Faith in science and progress, as expressed by Darwin, Huxley and Wells, was challenged by such doomsayers as Samuel Butler, who wrote: "Day by day the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them.... Our opinion is that war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed...." To justify this chauvinism, he contrasted the slow evolution of our species with the dizzying progress of the mechanical arts. Fifty years later, in 1921, Karel Capek's play RUR put the word robot, derived from the Czech robota (forced labor), into the English language. In this "comedy about truth and science," robots have been marketed worldwide to take over almost every task. "The human machine was terribly imperfect," remarks one of the scientists, "it had to be removed sooner or later. God hasn't the least notion of modern engineering." All goes well until the scientists give the robots emotions. Then, resentful of their subordinate status, they rise in destructive rebellion. Fritz Lang's 1926 film Metropolis develops a comparable theme. The inventor Rotwang creates a clone of the human Maria to provoke a rebellion among the workers of the underground city as a pretext for destroying them. "I have created a machine in the image of man that never tires or makes a mistake," he declares. "Now we have no further use for living workers." The workers-though cowed to robot-like submission-destroy his invention and save themselves. Early movies-notably a haunting group of German silents-explored the theme of artificial life. In Homunculus, The Golem, Alraune, and Hollywood's Frankenstein, a monstrous creation is driven to violence by a realization of its lack of humanity, or by the cruelty of man, its maker. These creatures belong to the Gothic-Romantic tradition; their message is anti-scientific: "There are things man was not meant to know." In recent years, such monsters have threatened nothing but the nerves of teenagers watching exploitation movies, butthe theme of artificial life was given intelligent treatment in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, an adaptation of Philip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? In a future world, man has created replicants that are visually identical to himself, but stronger and more intelligent. The moral issue is that of RUR: do we have the right to create superior creatures and then abuse them and deny them emotions?</page><page sequence="4">7 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; _ifwu. N3i'.SSt. The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Post-war science fiction movies have borrowed heavily from the puIps, in which robots zapped our troops with heat rays, and carried off our women. There were a few intelligent exceptions. In The Day the Earth Stood Still, an alien arrived in Washington, D.C. to advocate a nuclear freeze. Concerned that he might have problems delivering this message (in the Eisenhower years the military always shot first) he brought along Gort to run interference. Gort was your all-purpose impregnable man of steel (actuallythe doorman of Grauman's Chinese Theater-the tallest man in Hollywood-wearing a metal-sprayed rubber suit). But the clanking monster is a thing of the past. Technology no longer breaks down doors, it infiltrates, or worse, it is all around us, invisible and malevolent. The monsters in Forbidden Planet and the Soviet film Solaris were figments of human imagination. In 2001:A Space Odyssey, the entire spaceship is a robot that is animated by HAL 9000, its computer brain. When Hal announces that he is incapable of error and decides he knows better than the crew how to run the ship, they are compelled to perform a lobotomy in order to save themselves. The computer in Demon Seed decides to reproduce and, in the spirit of "reach out and touch someone," it impregnates the scientist's wife with the aid of a robot arm. Nothing like this happens in the stories of Isaac Asimov. As his 21st-century scientist, Susan Calvin, declares: "To you, a robot is a robot. Gears and metal, electricity and positrons.-Mind and iron! Human-made! if necessary, human-destroyed! But you haven't worked with them, so you don't know them. They're a cleaner better breed than we are." Asimov's robots are programmed with three laws to guarantee their good behavior: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Asimov explores the philosophical relationship between man and robot and the limitations of machine intelligence. The best science fiction writing is more thoughtful than all but a handful of movies.</page><page sequence="5">8 Hollywood has treated the robot theme in a variety of films from adult features such as Columbia's recent Blade Runner (5), 1982, to such long-forgotten mega- bombs as Zombies of the Stratosphere (1), a 1952 Republic Pictures t Corporation twelve-part serial. A production still from Dancing Lady (2), 1933, a Joan Crawford musical, includes a scene with a band of metallic men. Other amusing robot-like characters appear in Forbidden Planet (3), 1956, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer's space- age homage to Shakespeare's The Tempest; and the immensely popular Sleeper (4), 1973, a comedy of contemporary manners written and directed by Woody Allen.

George Grosz Design for a theatrical dummy in Iwan Goll's Methusalem. The Eternal Bourgeois, 1922 3. Fortunato Depero Costume per Teatro Plastico, 1916 4. Edward Kienholz The Friendly Grey Computer-Star Gauge Model no. 54, 1955 motor-driven assemblage Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York Gift of Jean and Howard Lipman Artists have used robot imagery to comment on society. The futurists celebrated the machine with unrestrained enthusiasm-as in Fortunato Depero's 1916 designs for the theater that portray people as robot-like creatures. But the objects of the futurists' affection were curiously old- fashioned. At heart they remained 19th-century romantics, looking forward to a brave new world, unaware of the technological changes that surrounded them. Their contemporaries-George Grosz, John Heartfield and Raoul Hausmann-took a pessimistic view of the world. Their photomontages are intended to satirize an impersonal society tumbling towards destruction, like a machine that is out of control. Robot imagery has also been a rich source of inspiration for sculptors. The absurdist machines of Jean Tinguely and Nam June Paik are at the opposite pole from Ernest Trova's sleek metallic figures, yet all three are unmistakably robotic. One of Edward Kienholz's constructions, The Friendly Grey Computer, is accompanied by a text that reads in part: "Computers sometimes get fatigued and have nervous breakdowns, hence the chair for it to rest in. If you know your computer well, you can tell when it's tired and sort of blue and in a funky mood ... .rememberthat if you treatyour computer well it will treat you well." The ironic tone, and the distinctly unheroic guise of the chair-bound computer is a far cry from the futurists' worship of the machine as a secular god. Robby the Robot, the star of Forbidden Planet, could cook, drive, speak 188 languages, and was as friendly as a puppy. In another movie, SilentRunning, three small robots named Huey, Dewey and Louie, maintained an extra-terrestrial nature reserve and played a mean game of poker. Like C-3PO of Star Wars, they embody a popular fantasy: of the uncomplaining slave that never breaks down, brings us breakfast in bed, washes up afterwards and then performs tricks. Such marvels have been realized on a limited scale. An 18th- century Japanese inventor perfected a mechanical doll that would walk to a neighboring sake store and not return until its container had been filled. Some years later, a mechanical chess player remained a popular attraction even after someone had detected the diminutive human player hidden in the base. Even so practical a man as Joseph Engelberger, President of Unimation, plans to build a robot servant to welcome his guests and serve drinks. You can buy automatons that (the manufacturers claim) will walk your dog, vacuum your carpet and cook your dinner. The Consumer Guide has yet to test them, but the best warning is provided in RUR, in which the scientists prefer to do their own cooking because the robots that are programmed to cook do it very badly.</page><page sequence="9">12 wIS l IIINh1 aiV I 3 ~~~~~~~~ r Li -~~~ Historically, the main function of automatons has been to entertain. Chinese emperors and Renaissance princes delighted in such toys. Leonardo da Vinci created a mechanical lion; the 18th-century Swiss inventor Pierre Jaquet-Droz built a boy-automaton that dipped its pen into an inkwell and wrote a letter in copper-plate script. There are over twenty restaurant chains in the U.S. that offer a mechanical cabaret as a lure to children of all ages. The pioneer in this field, Pizza Time Theatre, presents Dolli Dimples, the performing hippo, and a lion ("The King") that sings Elvis's greatest hits with convincing thrusts of the pelvis. At Disney's EPCOT Center, you can hear a squeaky- clean version of American history from the lips of the latest "Audio-Animatronics," a lifelike Ben Franklin and a suitably droll Mark Twain. The most ambitious-and curious enterprise to date is the cloning of Andy Warhol. The task was given to Alvaro Villa, who developed animated figures for Disney, then established his own company, AVG Productions, to create the Battlestar Galactica and Dracula's Castle shows for Universal Studios Tour. AVG looks like a cross between Santa's workshop and a research laboratory. Amid the singing alligators and dancing frogs that are destined for theme restaurants, is the incredibly complex mechanism that will become a lifelike Warhol. The artist, whose wish that he were a machine is about to be fulfilled, was photographed, measured and videotaped to capture every nuance of his notoriously inexpressive face and body. The body comprises eighty pneumatic pistons that animate thousands of mechanical joints. The face is of molded rubber and will have eighteen separate gestures, including a subtle twitch of the lips and a characteristic nod of the head. Villa explains that a special computer had to be designed and programmed from the client's script. The mystery, soon to be solved, is what "Warhol" will do on tour. It would be appropriate if it were to appear on talk shows promoting a book that had been written by a computer: a labor-saving arrangement that should appeal to every best-selling author. You may be wondering if these digressions have anything to do with robotics. Samuel Johnson had the answer. He declared that: "The movements that put into action machines of no use but to raise the wonder of ignorance, may be used to drain fens, manufacture metals, assist the architect or preserve the sailor." Scientists are scrambling to realize this blueprint. Theirs is a two-step process: turn dreams into reality; improve the prototype to assure dependable performance. For every breakthrough, there are many setbacks. In fiction, robots step out as surefootedly as any human. In fact, a six- legged robot has forty-million possible movements. The fewer its legs, the more critical is the problem of balance. Some years ago, General Electric developed a prototype Cybernetic Anthropomorphic Machine (CAM) for the Army.</page><page sequence="10">13 Automatons lack one important characteristic that is the key to robotics: reprogrammability. But from articulated Egyptian statues, to mechanical clocks, to Jaquet-Droz's 1774 boy writer, to today's singing "Cyberamics" such as Pizza Time Theatre's rock 'n' roll lion, these amusing and often intricately designed entertainments have captivated generations of curiosity seekers. They have also served to pave the way for their cybernetic descendants. Its four six-foot-long legs were controlled by a human driver through force feedback (that is, the amplification of the operator's own bodily movements). GE has successfully applied the principle in its Man-Mate Industrial Manipulator, which can lift up to seven thousand pounds. But the CAM stumbled and was abandoned. Now, Carnegie-Mellon University's Institute of Robotics is about to test a six-legged model that is being funded by the Department of Defense. Each leg has sensors to tell it when it has stepped into a hole and how to get out. Two other major areas of research are touch and vision. Both MIT and Stanford are experimenting with robot finger joints that are precisely controlled by cable ortape muscles, and whose fingertips have a sensitivity comparable to those of a human. Such a device, if perfected, would have immediate value to amputees. However, a related problem has then to be solved: how to reduce the size of the power packs that are needed to amplify nerve and muscle impulses, and thus activate the hand as an extension of the human arm. In industry, the hand could be connected to a massive robot arm, and the problem would not arise. A group of researchers at the University of Minnesota, including mechanical engineer Max Donath, is experimenting with a three-fingered robotic hand that will be more sophisticated than existing industrial grippers. Constructed of hollow aluminum tubes, the fingers are designed to be lightweight and are driven by motors on the forearm of the robot via cables. The "hand" will carry out a wide diversity of tasks rather than the single or limited capability of current industrial robot "end-effecters." We can also progress beyond nature. Ichiro Kato, Professor of Robotics at Japan's Waseda University, has created a twenty-five-fingered hand to diagnose breast cancer. Not only does the device have a highly developed tactile sense, but its lack of human emotions reportedly permits a completely objective diagnosis. An equally challenging task is to simulate vision. Robots now in production can, by computer analysis of video pictures, discern the outline of an object. To do this, the picture is broken down into a series of spots that are graded by brightness like a half-tone photo. By increasing the contrast, the object is defined as a silhouette. For many industrial jobs that is sufficient, but experimental models in corporate and university research departments have greater capability. The Japanese have employed a seeing robot to detect impurities in ampuls of a potentially dangerous drug. The human inspectors claimed that their eyesight was being impaired by the need for unremitting concentration. The robot eye never tires, but it has to be precisely calibrated to achieve an acceptable level of judgment.</page><page sequence="11">14 011~~~~~* NASA is responsible for our most sophisticated robotic technology. The space agency has applied its research to a series of par-tially autonomous space probes from Voyager I in 1977 to the Viking Lander and now the Rover, projected to land on Mars in 1984. Many factors determine the degree of sophistication that can or needs to be achieved. The Mars Rover, designed by Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA, comes close to the limits of available technology. Cost and bulk allowances are generous, but the vehicle has to deliver extraordinary performance over an extended period of time, in hostile conditions and with no possibility of maintenance. The proposed vehicle has tracked feet to carry it over rough or soft ground, and sonar devices to trigger its hands. It would be able to judge the size, shape and distance of objects through computer analysis of information from a laser beam and twin video cameras. If it were unable to surmount an obstacle, it would stop and await further instructions from earth. The Rover exists only on paper; NASA's Voyager space probes have performed in spectacular fashion for over five years, changing trajectory and sending back pictures under the direction of on-board computers and signals from a billion miles away. The Voyager, like the Mars Rover, needs to be partially autonomous. Instructions from earth take too long to arrive for it to depend upon outside guidance. Its programs are designed to anticipate a variety of scenarios and allow for corrective action or a temporary shutdown: a fail-safe mechanism that prevents self-damage. Thus a productive partnership is established between man and machine; the human controllers intervening only in case of emergency or when they need to change the program. Carl Sagan cites an added advantage of reprogrammability: a robot explorer could be instructed to switch from biology to geology far more readily than could a specialized human astronaut. Today's robots have begun to deal with the unexpected. For automatons, that could be a fatal hazard. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, Westinghouse exhibited two automatons: Elektro and Sparko, "the wonder dog." Sparko had sensors that picked up on light and heat. It won applause for following visitors around. One night, the door of the pavilion was left open. Sparko ran out, attracted by a passing car and, as the driver swerved, it homed in on the lights and was crushed. Back in the 1950s, researchers in England and at Bell Labs in America developed tiny robots that learned from their mistakes and, like a laboratory mouse, were able to negotiate an obstacle course. Only this year has such a device reached the market: a sentry robot manufactured by Denning Systems Incorporated. This two-hundred-pound, bulletproof guard will wheel around a property using ultrasonic range finders of the kind developed for Polaroid's automatic focusing cameras. Two microprocessors will analyze and store this information so that the sentry can compile a map of its territory, much as a blind person remembers spaces he cannot see.</page><page sequence="12">15 zIF) Westinghouse introduced Elektro, a seven-foot-high automaton, that performed at the 1939 New York World's Fair with Sparko, "the wonder dog." This year a robot watchman, equipped with infrared sensors and microwave radar, was marketed by Denning Systems Incorporated. The sentry has several advantages over a human night watchman. It will never get sleepy or steal; it is almost invulnerable to attack; it is too heavy to carry off; and it can "see" in the dark and through walls, using infrared sensors and microwave radar. Talos, the bronze giant that guarded ancient Crete, reacted to intruders by turning red hot and hugging them to death. Denning's sentry is more humane. It merely sounds an alarm, which is just as well, since it is unable to distinguish between a thief and the plant manager. Though primitive, the sentry is a step beyond those mechanized trolleys that deliver mail or industrial parts by following an electronic track. "Mobile robotics is a crucial field ... inherent in the concept is autonomous control," says Michael Brady, senior researcher in artificial intelligence at MIT. A Carnegie-Mellon scientist, Hans Moravec, goes further: "In the evolutionary process, mobility led to intelligence." It may have a similar effect in robotics. Thus, each advance-mobility, vision, touch and learning capability-fosters another, and every specialist has some influence on his peers. As the size and cost of computers shrinks, as servo-mechanisms become more capable, as more companies and researchers enter the field, the potential expands. In addition to his previously described diagnostic hand, Ichiro Kato is working on a robot that will be able to walk, talk and have the intelligence of a five-year-old. That claim is greeted with scepticism by those who believe that there will be no such dramatic advance in robotics until we have perfected a new breed of computer. And debate rages over the feasibility of developing a "thinking" computer. Researchers, including a large team of Japanese scientists, are dedicated to creating artificial intelligence; the results thus far are inconclusive. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems, and deal with such structured situations as playing chess, diagnosing a disease and predicting the outcome of legal cases. They do so by mechanical analysis of human expertise that has been fed into their memory banks. Yet even the most powerful among them has no ability to learn, or to proceed, as humans do, by analogy. Hubert Dreyfuss, a University of California philosopher who has studied the subject for twenty years, argues that they never will. He believes that computers are nothing more than fancy calculating machines; that they are structurally incapable of dealing with real-life problems. "You can't put in the shared understanding of human concerns and the purposes that embody society," he says.</page><page sequence="13">16 4 General Motors began using working robots on the assembly line in the 1960s. Industrial applications, slowed only by the current recession, will certainly dominate our production processes by the close of this century. Just as space flight was impossible until we had developed rockets, so with computers: we have to come up with a new system that can learn without relying on humans to teach it. To grasp the magnitude of the problem, consider an everyday function like getting up from a chair and the complexity of the movements that are required. Then consider the vastly greater subtleties of mastering a language and employing it with clarity and feeling. Those who believe, as Arthur C. Clarke does, that we are in the process of creating our successors-that computers will eventually match or excel every aspect of human intelligence-argue that humans are also products of engineering, genetically programmed by the DNA code. They maintain that a human would be as helpless as a computer in unfamiliar situations without exposure to the world, and that this exposure can be artificially simulated. And they point out that computers are a mere thirty years old, as primitive in their development as were aircraft engines in the 1930s. Meanwhile, the deployment of working robots proceeds apace. Their greatest concentration is in the factory. Unimation, the first and still the largest robot manufacturer in the world, installed its first robot at General Motors in 1961. Unimation did not turn a profit until 1975. During those years only a few large companies employed robots, and then only on a man-for-machine replacement basis-to do the dirty work of welding, assembling parts and tending die-casting machines. Only now is a boom (held back by the current recession) in sight. Unimation, and its closest competitor, Cincinnati Milacron, offer a wide range of robots, from monsters that can handle the heaviest loads, to the nimble PUMA and T3 models that were designed to work in confined spaces and alongside humans. The largest U.S. corporations are gearing up for the production and use, not just of individual robots, but of computer-controlled factories. Computer- assisted design and manufacture (CAD/CAM) are the new buzz words. The sale of advanced manufacturing systems is expected to grow from one to twenty-nine billion dollars in this decade! American companies still lead in technology, notably in software. But, across the Pacific ...</page><page sequence="14">17 - -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ s~~~~~~ \~~~~ Marilyn Monroe as a singing "Cybot," was created by Shunichi Mizuno. The Japanese run with technological innovation and implement it with aplomb. We tend to agonize, and so are likely to be upstaged. Joseph Engelberger, President of Unimation Japan has, in a single decade, outstripped America and Europe in its application of robotics to all aspects of industry. One explanation for this is attitude. The New York Times correspondent, Henry Scott Stokes, notes that ". . . the Japanese have a love affair with robots ... a unique, intensely personal reaction, with roots in Buddhist values." The Japanese have always had an emotional attachment to tools, which they regard almost as friends. For years they decorated tools on the New Year, a practice now extended to robots. They even ascribe feelings to them. In Japan, children watch television cartoons with robot heroes and villains. Their robot toys are a remarkable blend of childhood fantasy and sophisticated engineering. One of these, the God Marz, is described in the promotional flier as "Ruler of all the Robots, a combination of the gods of the past joining strength with the gods of modern technology.... When pulled apart, God Marz becomes six powerful rulers, each with weapons and accessories, ready to maintain harmony throughout the universe." Japanese families pack department stores to watch the performances of automatons dressed as princesses, samurai and a Marilyn Monroe look-alike. Marilyn, the creation of Shunichi Mizuno, is computer-programmed to sing River of No Return, play a guitar, wiggle and wink. Others in the Mizuno family include Thomas Edison and John F. Kennedy. Architect Arata Isozaki designed a giant robot for the Cybernetic Environment of the 1970 Osaka World's Fair. Its primary task was to assemble blocks to form a stage, but it could also walk and dance, emit light, sound and fog. Japan has even begun to automate the near- mystical process of making sushi. There are now 450 robots that mold rice balls, a craft that normally requires a five-year apprenticeship. Japan's greatest success has been in integrating robots into the production process. Fifteen years ago Japan had almost no robots; today it employs more than all other countries combined-a total of 14,000. By the year 2000 it is expected to have a million in operation. In 1967, it began to build the American Unimate under license; today, GE, IBM and Westinghouse are recovering from their late entry into the market by manufacturing Japanese designs.</page><page sequence="15">18 4g, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Robot toys are enormously popular in Japan.

The application of industrial robots in Japan soared in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis and a steep rise in labor costs. Japan has few natural resources: its survival depends upon high productivity. In a few years, the cost of a robot dropped from ten times the average annual wage to a little more than twice as much-at which point most managers were willing to install robots. (So were their American colleagues. GM Chairman Roger Smith declared that ". . . every time the cost of labor goes up one dollar an hour, a thousand more robots become economical.") But Japan had additional incentives. Workers were in short supply, and few could be found to do dangerous or dirty jobs. Unions welcomed robots-not only to mechanize, but to humanize factories. Management consulted with labor, and offered displaced workers retraining programs. The use of robots was stimulated by accelerated depreciation benefits, and through leasing programs that made them accessible even to one-man workshops. In a small factory featured on Japanese television, a Shinto priest conducts a purification ceremony; the company president introduces the new robot to his staff and sets it in motion. Large companies, like Fujitsu Fanuc, have manufactured their own robots and have introduced all- robot factories, in which humans are needed only for cleaning and routine maintenance. Japanese workers say "good morning" to robots, and name them after pop singers and baseball stars. Given lifetime job security, a more pleasant working environment, and a share of increased profits, their enthusiasm is easy to understand. Are you going to reduce your work force twenty- five percent by putting in robots, or one-hundred percent by going out of business? Thomas G. Gunn, Arthur D. Little Group Business Weekly forecasts that, "...in the United States, 'steel collar workers' could displace up to seventy-five percent of the factory work force." Other analysts predict major layoffs in service industries. We should remember that similar cries of alarm were sounded two centuries ago. In the early 19th century, Luddites smashed machines, but mechanization proceeded apace. Then, as now, the challenge was to share the new wealth, and create new jobs. We are in for a painful period of adjustment-a lot rougher than one might suspect from reading Alvin Toffler's The Third Wave. Optimists look ahead to a brave new world in which robots, guided by computers, will do all the unpleasant work, leaving to humans "only those tasks that are intrinsically human," in Asimov's phrase.

Just before she dies, Gretchen tries to alert everyone that Stephano and Alex are the culprits, but she is unable to. Liz again tells Neil she's not carrying his child. believes that "our future depends upon a partnership between human and machine intelligence," and that acceptance is a matter of acclimatization. Or, as the scientist in RUR proclaimed: "Man shall be free and supreme, with no other care than to perfect himself." Pessimists (such as Kurt Vonnegut in PlayerPiano) see a society in which a small elite run the machines, and an unemployable majority subsists on handouts in resentful idleness. It sounds like the Roman Empire all over again, with robot slaves and video circuses. Optimists and pessimists must wonder what most people are going to do without the work ethic to spur them, and with such limitless expanses of leisure time to occupy. For better or worse, robots will certainly play an ever- expanding role in our lives. Atthistime they are used mainly as tools, or as substitutes for things we already have. A teacher in the Bronx had her husband make a teaching robot that she could program to assist backward pupils. A smaller, more sophisticated version is now being produced, but it is no longer necessary. Children have, through their exposure to television and video games, become so accustomed to the small screen that they can interact with a computer terminal as readily as with a humanoid robot. A robot named George suffers a heart attack several times each day so that pre-med students can recognize and respond to the symptoms. Psychiatrists at Bellevue Hospital program a robot to deal with unstable patients-who seem less hostile towards a machine than to doctors. A robot named Silent Sam plays flagman, tirelessly slowing traffic beside a construction site. The special effects in films like Blade Runner and Star Wars are generated by computer- controlled cameras making multiple passes over miniatures of space vehicles and futuristic model cities. In time, robots may be used to test new cars, dispose of bombs and radioactive waste and perform on voice command for the sick and handicapped. A surgeon may conduct operations by remote force feedback, working through a slave robot in an inaccessible location. Robots may drill on the ocean floor or repair a crippled ship, remaining in place indefinitely without food or air; they may be used to assemble solar collectors in space, to mine and refine ore on remote planets and to ship it back to earth. All of these projects are on the drawing board. To reach beyond them we have onlyto use our imaginations, or delve into the work of writers and illustrators, whose fantasies are unconfined by practical limitations. Meanwhile, there is an encouraging sign that we may be losing our fear of robots and achieving harmony between ourselves and our machines: a robot has recently joined the cast of Days of Our Lives. Where the soaps lead, America is sure to follow.</page></plain_text>
