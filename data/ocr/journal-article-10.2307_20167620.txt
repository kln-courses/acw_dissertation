These religious specialists have been referred to in Western accounts as priests or sorcerers and in Chinese accounts as duan gong ( jjgj fe) or wu ( 35). Among the Qiang ( ft) people they are regularly spoken of as sh?pi (sometimes transcribed as xi/p/).1 In this article I will refer to them as sh?pi. I will also refer to them as shamans because I believe that their ritual activities display, on the whole, an underlying shamanistic trait as faith healers, mediators between humans and supernatural beings, masters of spirits and defeaters of malignant forces, conductors of lost souls and guides of the dead, diviners of luck and misfortune, makers of rain and keepers of oral tradition. On the following pages, I will examine the Qiang shamans' ritualistic paraphernalia in detail, true to the conviction that material objects embody ideas and concepts of spiritual life in solid form.2 Historical background The Qiang of today inhabit the Min Shan Mountains in northwestern Sichuan high above the banks of the Min Jiang River and its tributaries, the Hei Shui He and theTsa Gu Nao rivers. Their territory is bounded by 103.2?-104.2? E and 31.3?-32.4? N, covering four counties of the Aba Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan: Wenquan, Lixian, Maowen, and Heshui counties.3 The name of the present-day Qiang is already mentioned on oracle bone inscriptions nearly 4,000 years old. The composed Chinese character "Qiang" is a combination of the character for "sheep" and the subscribed character for "man" which, put together, can be read as "sheep people." A variation of the word adds the component for "magic."4 Appropriate to their name, the Qiang have always been and still are a pastoral society in which sheep play an important role, including in religious practice (sheep are, for instance, the preferred sacrificial animals and used as guides of the dead). From the many references to the Qiang on oracle bones it can be deduced that they were constantly at war with the Shang, their eastern neighbors, whose capital was at Anyang. Throughout the Shang dynasty the Chinese undertook military expeditions against the Qiang, capturing and enslaving them, and even making them victims of human sacrifices to their own ancestral gods. Under King Wu Wang (1121-1115 b.c.) the reign of the Shang was overthrown by the Zhou, in a war in which Qiang warriors took a leading part in helping to establish the Zhou dynasty. It is said that the grandmother of the Zhou leader who overthrew the Shang reign was herself a Qiang woman (Graham 1958:4-5). And a woman of the Jiang clan associated with the Qiang is the supposed geneatrice of the Zhou ancestor, which confirms on mythological ground the ally relations between Qiang and Zhou (Stein 1957:1). Hostile to the Shang and inclined to the Zhou, during the sixteenth to the eleventh centuries b.c. the Qiang differences in language, culture, and religious practices and these may make it difficult in some cases to discern who should actually be counted as Qiang. In accordance with a proverb, the Qiang differ "in dialect by a distance of five li and in custom by a distance of ten li." This diversity reflects an ethnic multiformity dating back to the dawn of their history. 4. The Chinese character for "Qiang" % is composed of ? "sheep" plus ? "man" subscribed. The variation 7"E adds a "magic." On oracle bones of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties the name of the Qiang is written alternatively as 2?, % ^, or gC, which are precursor forms of the later Chinese character (Ricci 1999:185, entries 1228/9). This makes the word Qiang the oldest tribal name still in use, and despite the fact that even in early times the ethnonym already denominated a considerable spectrum of different groups, specialists agree that the contemporary Qiang of the Min Shan Mountains are distant relatives of those mentioned in the early inscriptions. 1. Depending on region and dialect the religious specialists of the Qiang are also referred to as shi pi, shi hi, shi or sh? (sometimes transcribed as xu); or alternatively as pi, hi, bi bu, bi to and bi mu; the Chinese term duan gong is also heard locally. Of the variants noted by the American ethnographer Graham (Graham 1958:53) bi mu is particularly interesting on account of its similarity to bi mo, the designation for the Nosu (Yi) religious specialist (Oppitz and Hsu 1998:43, 291). 2. The investigation is based on two trips to the Min Shan Mountains in 1998 and 2000. Mainly relying on my own (short) fieldwork and that of my research assistant Zhao Xiuyun, I have also consulted accounts of previous researchers where our own inquiries proved insufficient. 3. The population is presently estimated at around 200,000; this figure seems a bit too high compared to the census of 1978, which estimates the population at about 85,000. There are marked regional</page><page sequence="3">12 RES 45 SPRING 2004 were spread in today's Gansu and western Shaanxi, where they were reported as being nomad hunters on the upper reaches of the Yellow River up to the Huang Shui River Valley. The historical annals of the Han dynasty mention a migration of Qiang people westward from Shaanxi to Gansu and from there southward to Sichuan (Eberhard 1942:70f.). According to a legend of their own, the ancestors of the present-day Qiang were forced by their enemies to migrate south into Sichuan where they collided with a pre-existing population called Ge. These people are described as stereotypical savages: tall but stupid, with massive bones, protruding brows, teeth that were long like fingers, a thick skull, a short neck, uncombed long black hair like the mane of a horse, eyes turned up, and with a tail. When the tail became shorter, they knew they would soon die. They had no domestic animals, did not cultivate the land, and lived only on fruit, herbs, and roots. They dwelled in caves and buried their dead in bottomless stone coffins (Stein 1957:4). A god told the Qiang how to conquer the Ge, by beating them with sticks and quartz stones. When the Ge were destroyed, the Qiang sanctified the white stones and their priests made the sticks into sacred wands. According to legend, the migration south into the territory of the Ge people took the ancestral Qiang more than a year. On their way, it is said, the migrant forefathers crossed a river, using round boats covered on the sides and below with cow hides or sheepskins. One of these coracles leaked and the sacred books the migrants had brought with them got wet. While the books were being dried in the sun, some goats came and ate them (Graham 1958:7, 22). Therefore, the Qiang no longer had a written language, and the contents of the lost books were handed down orally from generation to generation.5 After one branch of the Qiang took residence in the Min Shan region, their local history continued to be one of constant warfare, either with the Chinese or with their new neighbors, such as the Jiarong. This explains why many of their villages look like fortified strongholds, with high conical watch-towers and massive, flat-roofed houses that were hard to seize (figs. 1 and 2). In a.D. Figure 2. Semi-fortified Qiang houses, 1998. Photo: Michael Oppitz. 1441 a Tibetan tribe assisted the Chinese against the Qiang, and for this support the tribals were given land near Wenquan; since then these people are called Wassu?today are southern neighbors of the Qiang (Graham 1958:6). During the reign of Qianlong (1 757 1795), the Qiang participated in a rebellion but were defeated, and since then have had to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Chinese state. Under Communist rule the Qiang suffered heavily. Their religious activities were suppressed, particularly during the period of the Cultural Revolution; in recent years, however, they have been granted more religious freedom. As a result of this trend of liberalization, the old religious traditions have been reactivated to a degree?and it has become possible to study them. 5. It should be stated that in the region of the present Qiang slate slab coffins have been unearthed and that besides skeletons, ancient bronzes, pottery, and Chinese coins have also been found inside them, datable between 500 and 100 b.c. (Graham 1958:7 and plates 2-3). Because the Qiang practiced cremation as their exclusive form of burial until recently, these tombs have been attributed to the Ge. If this hypothesis is correct, the settlement of the Qiang in the Min Shan Mountains can be fixed to about 100 b.c.</page><page sequence="4">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 13 Sh?pi paraphernalia The paraphernalia of the Qiang shaman will be examined in sets. The assignments proposed in this article (costume, sound instruments, weapons, divination tools, and others) do not always correspond with indigenous classifications, as will become evident when the origin myths of some instruments are presented. These divergences will be indicated whenever they seem significant. Costume The monkey-skin hat. The most spectacular piece of shamanic dress is a towering hat made of fur and skin of the golden-haired monkey. This monkey-skin hat, called jar t?, is decorated with white cowrie shells, various iron and copper pieces, small horse bells of brass, polished white bones, and, more rarely, a pair of cloth pennants. On top the hat has three points made out of the monkey's tail (figs. 3 and 4).6 On the backside of the hat various stripes of monkey skin patched together hang down the shoulder of its owner (fig. 5). With the three furry points at the top the headgear looks more like a crown than a hat. As such, it is reminiscent of other animal crowns in the north Asian shamanic world (such as the feather crowns of the Himalayan faith healers or the iron antler crowns in Southern Siberia). A well-preserved example of the monkey-skin hat is that of shaman Wang Zhisheng of Goutou Village, Wenquan County (fig. 6). The three points of the crown stand out prominently, and the face of the monkey can be easily discerned: two cowrie shells on the upper part of the hat's front side mark the eyes; a brass ornament below the eyes stands for the nose; and a brass disk with the Chinese character shang m (reward) under the nose represents the mouth.7 In addition, the skull of the monkey head is brought out by a shorn section in the central part of the skin, while around it the hair has been kept long. Below the outlines of the monkey head a circular disk of polished white bones, presumably the kneecaps of a tiger, and a horizontal set of cowrie shells arranged as triangles, represent efficacious ornaments: brooch and necklace. On some of the hats the real ears of the monkey have been left on. The ears enable the hat to hear and the eyes, in the form of cowries, make it see?both in the literal and figurative sense. Other ornaments believed to multiply the hat's power are small circular brass mirrors or little horse bells resembling sleigh bells on which the Chinese character wang zE (king) is carved. Instead of brass disks with Chinese characters, I have also seen an iron plaque in the shape of a star, placed above the cowrie eyes. In this case the monkey skin is sewn on a larger piece of red cloth that serves as lining. All Qiang shamans use the three-pointed monkey skin hat to conquer demons. According to their belief, the monkey that supplies the material for the fur hat is sacred and prefers a sacred habitat: a conifer forest. As it is the purest of animals, it stands in extreme contrast to the vilest of beings?the demons. According to one older source, the monkey head is worn when the shaman is sacrificing to the gods or is redeeming a vow, while in exorcising evils he is said to wear a different kind of hat made of bamboo that is pasted with a five colored paper.8 In the old Tibetan tradition, monkeys and demons are well-known partners and antagonists. One famous myth relates that man was born from a sexual union between a monkey and a rock demoness; and according to the Padma thang-yig a rock demon of eastern Tibet appeared in the guise of an old man with a monkey hat on?just like the Qiang shamans (Steinl 957:7). The monkey-skin hat is kept by the shamans like a treasure?stored at a secret place in the house. And it is worn with pride.9 The right to wear the monkey-skin hat is a privilege of those who have passed a certain initiation stage. This is reached in a ceremony called pi ge tsa (ceremony to thank the teacher). In this ceremony an assembly of initiated shamans puts young initiates to a test. After inviting the so-called "poison king" who materializes in 6. These uprising points are called from left to right: pi ngi sh?r or "clear distinction between black and white"; mo bi or "heaven"; and ru b? or "earth" (Hu 1941:16). They may have cosmological connotations, indicating a universe of three stages between which the wearer of the hat negotiates. 7. The Chinese character shang, Jt (reward) on the brass disk was already registered some sixty years ago by Graham on several monkey skin hats in the Wenquan region. According to him, this was a decoration conferred to Qiang priests by the Chinese magistrate for their services in praying for rain. This plaque gave the shaman's work official recognition, enlarged the efficacy of the hat and added to the dignity of its owner (Graham 1958: 56). 8. The bamboo hat is called tan tsu and looks like a fisherman's basket (Hu 1941:16). I have not seen such a hat, and it may well be that it has disappeared, leaving its former functions to the monkey-skin hat. 9. The degree of veneration?to the hat in particular and the golden-haired monkey in general?can be estimated by the fact that one old shaman, Wang Jiuqing of Puxi Village, Lixian County, whom we had asked to let us photograph his paraphernalia, gave permission for all pieces except for the monkey-skin hat; it was his most sacred possession.</page><page sequence="5">14 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 3.

This done, the young shaman is entitled to wear the monkey skin hat, a right for which he will thank his masters (L? Daji 1996:491). Wearing the monkey-skin hat commemorates a mythical monkey who supported the first shaman with useful advice and then became the patron and tutelary deity of all sh?pi. The story of the relevant myth is very popular, well known to all Qiang people and highly complex. It explains not only the origin of the monkey skin hat but also other shamanic implements, such as the effigy of the monkey patron and the one-sided drum; and it explains the origin of oral tradition. The story has been published several times (Hu 1941:15; Stein 1957:8; Oppitz 1998:340f.). The version presented here was related to the author by shaman Zhang Fuliang of Luobucai Village, Wenquan County in 1998: In the beginning, the original sh?pi or shaman had written books. Once every three years he would take a trip to a Buddhist lama to renew them. One day on his way home after he had collected a new set of scriptures, he settled down under a tree to take a nap. While he was asleep, a flock of sheep passed by and one of them ate up his scriptures. When the sh?pi woke up, he realized the disaster and, as he, having spent all his expenses, did not want to go back to the lama to ask for another set of books, he started to cry. A golden-haired monkey passed by and told the man in tears how to solve his problem. He instructed him how to kill the sheep and make a drum out of its skin. When the shaman started to play his new instrument, he could recite with each beat of the drum a phrase of his lost books. The next day the shaman lost his way and again the monkey appeared and carried him on his shoulder out of his impasse. Before reaching the shaman's home, the monkey died of exhaustion. Thereupon, the first shaman made himself a hat from the deceased monkey's skin and wrapped the skull with paper. Since then the shaman, when holding a ritual, wears a monkey-skin hat and keeps a monkey skull wrapped in paper as his patron deity. The five-lobed crown. The five-lobed crown, called sei da or si ta, is a tiara in widespread use in the Himalayan religious landscape and is most often worn in ritual dance performances. It is particularly common in Tibetan Buddhism and Bon circles. In Tibetan it is called rigs Inga (five families) and on each of its five segments a Buddha or one of his symbols is depicted. The Moso of northern Yunnan, strongly influenced by the Lamaist creed, call it the "crown of the five Buddhas" (Shih 1998:106). The dt?-mb? priests of the Naxi, whose religious traditions are closer linked to old Bon practices, also employ this tiara, which they call Wo or 6'a-fc'd (fig. 7).10 The Qiang five-lobed crowns, like those of the Naxi, are made either of leather or papier-mache. Ren Yongqing's crown, for instance, is made of leather with punched-out holes in each of the five segments forming ornamental patterns (fig. 8). The drawings on the leather have almost faded away. Adjoining segments are held together by short leather strings; a yellow ribbon of cloth keeps all five segments on the string and is used to bind the crown to the head. The crown of Xiao Yongqing, on the other hand, is made of papier-mach? and has a Buddhist appearance (fig. 9). The five-lobed crown is depicted in the divinatory picture books of the Qiang on various pages. To document this, I have selected a portrait of Taishang, the mythical founder of Qiang shamanism dressed in a dark robe and wearing a yellow crown (fig. 10). Another book page shows a shaman with a drum in his hands and a crown on his head performing a difficult birth ceremony for a parturiant woman. While he is chanting next to a tripod (or an incense jar), the woman in labor is seen opposite him lying on a plank bed (in a cowshed); on another, four-posted shed below is the newborn baby, naked and with a monkey head (representing man as descended from the monkey). As for the origin of the five-lobed crown, one Qiang sh?pi told us the following story: It was after the great flood when there were too many demons on earth and people died in great quantities that the first shaman was initiated. His name was Abamubu, the eldest son of the creator god Panguwang. Originally he was a carpenter. When he received the commission to build ? 10. The icons painted on the Naxi crown are: Dt?-mb? sh?-l?, the mythical founder of the dt?-mb? religion in the central segment; Dta l?-m?-mb?, the tiger god of burning fire, destroyer of demons to his right; the protective spirit T'?-ch? X?-m? to his left; Mu?n-bpd-dz?, a celestial dt?-mb?, oppressor of demons on the extreme right; and on the extreme left the Garuda, Dd? p'?r khyu-t'khy? (Rock 1963:200 and plate X). In Qiang iconography the depictions on the five-lobed crown have undergone further changes. In the center we usually find depicted Taishang Laojun, the founder and cultural hero of the local shamanist creed; on his left and right sides we find either theTaoist god Beifangzhenwuzhushi and a Buddhist Lama, or alternatively Taishang Laojun's younger brothers Yuqing and Shanqing; on the two wings the sun and moon gods are represented, or alternatively, the dragon and the phoenix, both heavenly protectors of man.</page><page sequence="7">16 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 7.

For this mistake he was thrown into hell where he stayed for twelve years. Three diviners, one residing in heaven, one in hell, and one on earth, tried to find him in vain, and when they finally found him they could not get him free. At last, one of them, Zhougong, did a dream divination in which he was told to perform a ceremony named "calling back-the-soul." This he performed for nine months until he got Abamubu out of hell. Once he was free, Abamubu changed his profession from carpenter to shaman. His father, the creator of heaven and earth, Panguwang, provided him with a five-lobed crown as a gift. This story bears some resemblance to the story of Ramma Puran Tsan, the first shaman of the Magar in Central Nepal. After some royal astrologers and faith healers intrigued against him, he too spent a long time in the underworld (nine years), where he worked unrecognized as a blacksmith. When he finally agreed to return to the human world, he set down the professional rules for all contemporary shamans, giving up his activities as a blacksmith (Oppitz 1981:10-20 and 1991:174-178). The leopard-skin jacket. A good number of shamans, particularly in the northern part of the Qiang area, own a special garment which they wear, so it seems, on momentous occasions: a jacket made of leopard fur. As the leopard is feared by the people for its ferocious strength, it is thought that wearing a coat made of its skin will transfer that power to its wearer. And such strength is needed, for instance, when the shaman sets out for a ritual dealing with the dangerous ghost of a person who has died an unnatural death. The leopard-skin jacket xupi gua zi (coat of the shaman) is usually made of patches of fur stitched together. Unlike the sleeveless sheepskin coats the leopard-skin jackets have long sleeves (figs. 9 and 24). When going to a client in a different part of the village or in a village far away, the shamans often throw their leopard-skin jacket over their shoulders, without slipping into the sleeves, which gives them an air of casual nonchalance. In the Zentou mountains, Lixian County, the leopard-skin jacket is sometimes lined with three rows of buttons in black, yellow, and white, which is the dominant color combination also of some shamanic bead necklaces (L? Daji 1996:490). The custom of wearing a leopard-skin jacket is explained by two legendary stories, as told to us by shaman He Changde and shaman Xiao Yongqing of Maoxian County: Long ago, the people of Maoxian wanted to build four gateways to their city. Some men were sent out to cut trees in the forest, but not a single tree could be felled, as they were all pointing straight to heaven. So a shaman from Erlicai village was consulted who held a three-day ceremony in honor of the mountain god, sacrificing a yak. Only then could the trees be cut down. To show the shaman his gratitude the headman of Maoxian invited him to the city. "Would you like to become an official?" the shaman was asked. "No." "Would you like to receive some gold and silver?" "No," answered the shaman again. But then the headman noticed that the shaman stroked three times over a leopard skin, with caressing fingers. So he asked him whether he would like to have the fur. The shaman accepted happily the headman's gift and tailored himself a jacket from it. That is the origin of the shaman's leopard-skin gown. The second story is similar: One day, a prominent Chinese official, some say the emperor himself, came to Maoxian to open a gold mine in the area. When his soldiers arrived at the foot of the mountain near Wei men village, they stopped, fearing to go any further, for they had heard of some belligerent local kings there. In fact, there was only an old man with eight sons up the valley. These sons caught a pig every morning and made it shriek; in the daytime, they shot their guns in the surrounding mountains; and in the evening they tied some incense sticks to the heads of some goats and made them run around in the hills so that from the distance the soldiers got the impression that there were many people around. And so they did not dare to climb up the hills. Finally, a pupil of Taishang Laojun offered his services as a guide, assuring the soldiers that there were only nine men in the mountains. And so the mission continued. To thank the shaman for his service, the emperor had him asked: "Would you like to become an official?" "No." "Would you like to receive some gold and silver?" "No." "Then what would you like?" The shaman said that he would like a leopard skin he had seen, in order to make a sacred coat out of it. The emperor granted the wish and gave the shaman, along with the skin, a necklace and a five-lobed crown, which ever since are worn by the Qiang shamans. Supplementary garments. Among the professional dress worn by the sh?pi, earlier ethnographies mention a skirt of white hemp cloth, jar pu. A photograph from 1937 taken by the British missionary Reverend T. Torrance depicts such a garment (fig. 11 ). I have not noticed such an item employed as a special shamanic dress; maybe it was not the season, for the two times I visited the Qiang were in a relatively cold period. It may also be that this garment has gone out of fashion. Highly rated, on the other hand, is the sleeveless sheepskin</page><page sequence="9">18 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 11. Hemp garment of Qiang sh?pi (with drum) and assistants, 1937. Photo: Thomas Torrance. coat, worn by many sh?pi and lay people alike (fig. 12). The hair of the sheep has been left on the skin. When the weather is dry and cold, the hairy side is worn inward; when it rains it is worn outward. The necklace. The necklace, pu mu or pu mo, originally given by an emperor or his executive hand to the shamans, is another indispensable object to be worn in ritual action?at least by those shamans who are able to expose themselves to great dangers. The necklaces vary from owner to owner and reflect in each case an individual story of acquisition and composition. Shaman Xiao Yongqing's necklace is made up of 102 round black beads plus two red ones and four white shell cylinders, a total of 108 members (fig. 13). Completing his shaman's necklace are various sharp animal tusks as well as an eagle's skull including its Figure 12. Qiang sh?pi with crown, drum, and cymbal wearing a sleeveless sheep-skin coat, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. beak, and an eagle's claws that he wears on the bottom front, plus a yellowish bone disk. He Qingrong's necklace is a combination of blue, white, black, and transparent (glass) beads, including two larger ones made of painted porcelain, one yellow bead, one white shell cylinder, two animal teeth, one sea shell and a brass amulet plate with Chinese characters written on it. A longish tiger bone is attached to the necklace (fig. 14). Ren Yongqing's necklace consists of a string of 102 alternating black and yellow wooden beads, and two red and two white stone pearls, a total of 106 beads. Ideally, it should be 108, as two black wooden members are missing (fig. 15). In addition, his necklace includes two wild boar tusks, two teeth of a river deer, one horn of a wild goat, and an eagle skull with the beak. The necklace is worn by Ren Yongqing so that the eagle skull sits at the back of his neck (fig. 12) to watch out with its</page><page sequence="10">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 19 Figure 13. A Qiang sh?pi necklace with black beads, animal tusks, an eagles skull, and claws, 1998. Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. exceptional vision for any attacks of malignant forces coming from behind. When we took photographs of his paraphernalia, Ren asked us not to take pictures directly from behind, for this would diminish the defensive power of the eagle skull. The recurring feature of sharp animal tusks, of eagle claws, skulls, and beaks on the necklace explains its function: to help its owner conquer all kinds of demons with the assistance of a m?tonymie task force?members of animals that can run swiftly through the wilderness and birds that can fly. The well-known ability of the shaman to move quickly through the air, reported among many Asian societies, is ascribed in the Qiang case mainly to three auxiliary tools: the drum (see the corresponding myth below), the glass beads hung over Figure 14. A Qiang sh?pi necklace, 2000. Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. Figure 15. A Qiang sh?pi necklace, 1998: Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. the shaman's chest and the necklace adorned with winged creatures' body parts. Thus the necklace has two main purposes: it is a tool that enables swift movements and a weapon to counter-attack demons. Sound instruments The one-sided drum. Of all the tools the shaman uses in the course of his s?ances, the most important one is the drum. There are two different types which have to be clearly distinguished: a one-sided frame drum with a handle inside the frame; and a double-sided frame drum with a handle installed outside on the frame. The former type is played with a drumstick, the latter with two mobile knobs at the end of leather strips that are fastened to the</page><page sequence="11">20 RES 45 SPRING 2004 frame on opposite sides. By twisting the handle forward and backward, the knobs strike automatically against the membranes. The one-sided drum is the larger of the two types. It is called bu, bo, mbo, i-bou, rbu or rue, depending on dialect variations. Morphologically it belongs to the order of classical shamanic drums. The front side of the bu drum is covered with a membrane, made of sheep or goat skin or of cow hide (fig. 16). According to a local classificatory distinction, cow-hide drums are used in rituals connected with the expulsion of ghosts and demons; drums made with sheep or goat skin are employed when dealing with deities.11 According to mythology, sheep skin is clearly the original and orthodox material for the membrane. The leather of the membrane is stretched over the rim of the wooden frame with the help of strings, which run in a zigzagging line from the border of the hide to holes in the middle of the hoop; these holes are placed in equal intervals all around the circular frame (fig. 17). Another fashion is to use nails to fasten the membrane to the wood of the frame; it is locally called the "Tibetan way" (fig. 18). The hair of the hide is completely shaved off except for the outermost brim beyond the drumming surface. These hairy remnants remind the people of the drum's animal origins. The drum frame consists of a single lath, bent to a circle with overlapping ends held together by iron clamps (fig. 19). The wooden hoop is often decorated with several bundles of red and white paper strips (fig. 20) interpreted in different ways: some say they represent the cranial hair of the drum (seen as a head); others say they represent medicinal plants that the first healer brought back from a celestial journey; and still others, referring to a myth, say these paper strips are a cover to hide bloodstains left on the primordial drum after a human being was killed in an accidental collision with the frame. The open backside of the drum is characterized, first and foremost, by a wooden handle that runs diametrically through the interior part of the frame. This handle, unlike most handles installed inside one-sided Asian drums, is not fastened at both ends directly to the frame; instead it is held by a circular wooden or iron ring that runs on a smaller radius parallel to the hoop and is connected to it by strings that run in a zigzagging line between the frame and inner ring (fig. 20). In some cases, these strings are the same as those that stretch the membrane over the outer ring of the hoop. Through this installation technique, both the drum handle and the interior ring, which passes through the handle at its two ends, hang suspended inside the drum, generating a rich and voluminous sound. Most handles are carved?with simple geometrical designs or stepped, engraved segments or figurative details such as a lizard or a sheep's head. Inside some of the frames, next to the top end of the handle, hang two brass bells, which with the movements of the drum produce an additional rhythmic sound. As a rule, the drum membranes are not covered with drawings. I saw one exception at a funeral in Napu village, Maoxian County, which carried a design on its hide: the famous eight trigrams or ba gua A ih (fig. 20). The trigrams, the circle around them, and the eight segments attached on the outer circle, each enclosing a single Chinese character, had all been applied in black ink with a brush. To find the ba gua painted on a drum not only signals the massive influence of Han Chinese concepts on the indigenous ways of religious thought, but also hints at the fact that the drum is a device for divination. As we shall see later on, Qiang shamans practice a form of drum divination similar to a technique found elsewhere in the Himalayas. In the native divination books of the Qiang shamans (see below), which assemble long sequences of figurative drawings next to abstract symbols, drums are frequently depicted (fig. 22). Whenever they are drawn with a drumstick, a one-sided drum is described. When the drumstick is missing, the drawing references a double sided hand-drum. The drumsticks of the contemporary shamans consist of a relatively straight piece of bamboo or other wood wrapped at the top with cloth, usually red (fig. 23).12 The big, one-sided drum of the Qiang priest is employed at many different ritual occasions: in healing s?ances, in which tutelary deities and auxiliary spirits are invoked and enemies such as ghosts and malignant spirits are exorcised; in ceremonies to retrieve lost souls; 11. In Chinese, this distinction is expressed by xiatan fashi (downward rituals) for driving away demons and by shangtan fashi (upward rituals) for worshipping gods. As far as contemporary practices are concerned, the distinction is generally neglected. 12. The various parts of the bu drum carry the following denominations: The drum skin or membrane is called tsa da; the drum frame or hoop is called wo i pa u jie; the paper strips decorating exterior sections of the drum frame are referred to as wu ba; the drum handle is wu pa shue or rue ji; the inner ring, associated with the "twelve earth branches," carries the name jia ji ba; the eight trigrams drawn on the membrane are called wo chi jia wa?they are said to have been originally drawn by the mythical founder Taishang Laojun; the bells inside the drum are called lin chu; and the drumsticks are referred to as wu ch?e or ruek jia.</page><page sequence="12">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 21 Figure 16.

Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. at weddings to ask for supernatural blessings to benefit the young couple; at initiation ceremonies for prospective new shamans; at various calendrical events; and at all kinds of rituals related to death. On these occasions the drum is employed as a means to transmit transcendental messages, as an instrument to accompany the recital of religious chants; as a tool to make enquiries about future events; as a transportation vehicle in ritual journeys; and as a rhythmic pacemaker for shamanic dances. The styles and rhythms of drumming vary from occasion to occasion, generating different moods, and, when simulating the dance movements, a considerable variety of steps. When a shaman goes to a client, the big drum has to be carried over the shoulder, just like the first shaman did when he descended from heaven to the people on earth (fig. 24). Two versions of a legendary tale relate in their own way how the transportation of the drum was to be effected. According to the first version: Originally, the shaman did not have to carry his drum to the client's home; it would fly on its own to the destination place?just like the shaman himself. One day, when he was called to a patient, he told his wife to open the door of the room in which the drum was stored as soon as she heard a noise from inside. After a while she heard the noise, but did not pay attention to it. She remained deaf to a second knock too. And when, after the third time, she finally opened the door, the drum came out flying at such speed that brushing against her head, the shaman's wife was killed. When the drum arrived at the client's place, the shaman noticed some blood on the frame?and he knew inmediately what had happened. Blaming himself, he took some five-colored paper strips and put them on the rim of the drum frame to cover the traces of blood. To prevent such accidents in the future, he diminished the size of the drum and decided to carry it by himself when going out for a ceremony. That is the origin of the paper strips and the shaman carrying the drum. The second version goes like this: A long time ago, there lived a shaman named Abagejie. He used to fly to his patients in the company of his drum. One day he forgot to bring it along. The drum was starting to make noises in its box. The shaman's wife, surprised by the banging, opened the box and was knocked on the forehead by the impetuous drum, which flew away to its master. The shaman, seeing blood stains on the drum frame, rushed home, only to find his wife already dead. Since that time, when someone wants to call in a shaman, the host has to send a person to the shaman's house and pronounce an explicit invitation to both him and the drum. And the drum must be carried by this person to the patient's house and? after the ritual?back to the shaman's. Once every year the bu drum has to be consecrated and its power reinvigorated. This ceremony, a small rite, is called in Chinese kai gu MSor "opening the drum." It has to be performed on a dragon day of the first lunar month of the year. It is said that no shaman should hold any other ceremony in the new year prior to this rite, otherwise it will bring bad luck. The origin myth of the big drum has already been told in connection with the genesis story about the monkey-skin hat (see above, pp. 15). Yet there is an interesting variant to this tale, as told to us by shaman Ren Yongqing of Heihu village, Maoxian County: A long time ago, in the Tang period, there was a monk by the name of Tang Seng, who undertook a journey to the western skies in the company of a monkey named Sun Wukong, in order to collect sacred scriptures. On their way back, they encountered a sheep ghost who ate all the newly acquired scriptures. The monkey got very angry, killed the sheep ghost, and used its skin to fabricate a drum. Thereupon Tang Seng and the monkey met with the Eighteen Arhats (i.e., wise men who have attained the State of Nirvana by leaving their Self behind). Listening to their teachings, Tang Seng picked up the sheep-skin drum and repeated all that he heard through their mouths. Since then all shamans use a drum when reciting their knowledge from memory. When he had finished this version of the drum origin myth, Ren Yongqing pointed out the parallels of his story to the famous Chinese novel Xi yu ji by Wu Chengen. This novel relates the adventurous journey of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602-664) to India, where he</page><page sequence="15">24 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 24. A sh?pi carrying his drum on his back, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 25. Xuanzang carrying books. Illustration from the novel Xi yu ji by Wu Chengen. collected sacred scriptures which he brought home to China for translation. In the novel, Xuanzang is accompanied on his pilgrimage to the west by a monkey, also named Sun Wukong, while he, the monk, is referred to as Sanzang. Sometimes he is also referred to as the "collector of scriptures" and on woodcuts and stone-rubbings that illustrate the many editions of the novel he is represented occasionally as a figure carrying a high load of books in a pannier (fig. 25). There can be no doubt that the same folklorist humus nurtured the Qiang myth on the origin of the shaman's drum resulting from the loss of scriptures and the Chinese tales about Xuanzang (called Tang Seng by the Qiang) and his monkey companion in search of books. This connection is echoed even in the Qiang myth on the origin of transporting the drum. The instruction on how the shaman should carry his instrument to his client may be seen as iconographically cognant with Xuanzang's manner of carrying scriptures?on the back. This resemblance (figs. 24 and 25) is less incidental if one recalls that book and drum are kin: As a medium of transmission the role of the book in a literary tradition is similar to that of the drum in an oral one. The double-sided drum. The second type of drum used by the Qiang priests and their assistants is a double-sided frame drum called jeo wo or ji wu with an exterior handle which runs diagonally through the interior and closed part of the drum. It usually is carved with geometrical ornamentation. A short end projects out of the frame at the upper tip, providing a small loop to hang up the drum, while the longer end, projecting</page><page sequence="16">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 25 Figure 26. A double-sided drum with carved handle, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 27. Two drums hanging from a pole (one- and double sided), 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. out of the frame at the lower tip, is the actual handle (fig. 26). Some drums, however, have a string hanger at the longer end of the handle. In this case the drum, when hung up, is upside down (fig. 27). On account of the length of the handle (20 to 30 cm) the double-sided frame drum is also known as the "long-handle drum." This drum is not beaten with a drumstick. Instead, it is played with the help of two leather knobs, hanging at the end of two leather strips, which are fastened on opposite sides to the frame; these knobs alternately beat the two membranes when the handle is jerked forward and backward. The ji wu drum of the Qiang can be classified as a variation of the widely spread Himalayan damaru: both are twirled forward and backward so that the beat is produced by two knobs flying in opposite directions. This attribution can be confirmed by a comparison with the corresponding Naxi drum, called dt?-bb?r-l?r.u However, both of these drums, while closely resembling each other, are considerably different from the standard damaru of the Tibetan and Nepalese Himalayan traditions. Here the drum's body is usually made up of two cup-shaped parts?in some cases 13. The name dt?-bb?r-l?r (pronounced damberl?r) is merely a phonetic imitation of the Sanskrit word damaru. The morphological features of the Naxi damaru are very similar to those of the Qiang // wu, and the Naxi pictograph for this instrument is almost identical with the pictorial representation of the ji wu in Qiang divination books, namely iPTas compared to T.</page><page sequence="17">26 RES 45 SPRING 2004 skulls?opposing each other in hourglass fashion; there, it is delimited by a single lath bent into a circle. In addition, where the Naxi/Qiang type has a wooden handle passing through the drum's body, theTibeto Himalayan type is held and operated with a ribbon of cloth or silk. Therefore the morphological kinship is not as obvious as the Naxi name suggests. What, then, could be a related type of drum? My suggestion is that it might be an ancient Bonpo drum as depicted in an old manuscript of the Czer myig, kept in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek (fig. 28).H The cymbal. The cymbal, called qi ni or shi tsai la, is a flat, circular metal bell, 10 to 25 cm in diameter, convex on one side and concave on the other, with a tapper made of ox-horn inside and a leather or cloth handle outside. When the handle is made of cloth, it consists of colored strips; in some cases it is simply a furry pendant. Some cymbals are said to have carved on the convex exterior side the eight trigrams, ba gua of the Chinese tradition. As in the Naxi pictograph for "dancing with cymbal and hand-drum" (fig. 29), the cymbal is played by the Qiang priest's left hand, while his right hand twists the hand-drum (fig. 30). When it is played in conjunction with the big bu drum, both instruments are held in the left hand, while the right hand operates the drumstick. As told in the preceding myth, the cymbal is associated with lightning, whereas the hand-drum is linked to the thunder. Like thunder and lightning, the hand-drum and cymbal complement each other (fig. 31). In addition, the cymbal is conceived as a mirror, in which demons can be caught.15 Figure 28. A Bonpo playing his drum (Gzer-myig manuscript). By courtesy of Staatsbibliothek Berlin. The yak horn. In Qiang rituals yak horns are used as trumpets (fig. 32). Referred to as zi r?r, they are blown on various occasions, particularly at rituals for a person who has died in an accident. Such events are grave, for the soul of the deceased is in great danger of becoming an eternally roaming ghost and, as such, is dangerous for the living. Yak horns, usually those of a pian niu (a cross breed of yak and cow), are employed to send acoustic messages up to heaven, and to request the help of celestial auxiliary forces. Two serial tales introduce the custom of blowing yak horns. In both Taishang Laojun, the alleged founder of Qiang shamanism, has the leading part. According to the first tale: Before the culture hero Taishang Laojun was born, his mother, by the family name of Li, was already pregnant for three years and six months. In this prolonged pregnancy the baby conversed with his mother from inside the belly. He said: "Please tell me when a man riding a horse or sitting in a sedan chair is passing by?for it is then that I will come out." One day, a man riding a yak came by and, as the mother was tired of her never-ending pregnancy, she cheated her son by saying that a man on a horse had come. Instantly the baby came out: not the normal way but out from under his mother's armpit. The birth left a hole under her arm, which the boy covered with some grass that he picked in a meadow. Since then human beings have had 14. This drum has been variously ascribed (Hoffmann 1950:193, 201 f.): to a Tibetan instrument called shang; to the Tibetan "half-drum" or pyed-nga; and to the Chukchee drum. The shang, however, is not a drum or tambourine, but a flat cymbal; the pyed-nga is a one-sided drum with its handle inside the hoop, used by Himalayan shamans of the Gurung, Thakali, Magar, and Chepang tribes. The association with a Chukchee drum is both geographically and culturally too far fetched?it is a variant of the Eskimo drum. If the Bonpo drum depicted in the old Gzer-myig manuscript has any morphological connection with a known drum type, the kinship should be sought in a double-sided hand-drum with a long handle passing through the body at both ends, just like the Naxi and Qiang variants of the damaru. This suggestion finds support if the strings hanging down on its side and ending in knobs?as seen in the manuscript drawing? represent clappers, for clappers indicate drums with membranes on both sides. 15. One of the two names for the Qiang cymbal, shi tsai la, can be associated phonetically to the Naxi name for it: h?-sh) ds-l?r, meaning golden cymbal. Like gold that flares up in the sun, the shiny metal of the cymbal dazzles the demons and its high, piercing sound puts all malignant forces to flight.</page><page sequence="18">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 27 hair under their arms. And as it was a yak that Laojunpusa (Taishang Laojun) had first seen in the outside world, the yak became an important animal in his later activities as a shaman. When starting a s?ance, he would blow a yak horn, and to tell the future, he would throw a pair of yak hoofs. This habit, says the second legend, was firmly established by Taishang's pupil Wa Xuji: When his time to depart from his teacher had come, Wa Xuji asked Taishang what to do when he encountered problems in the performance of a ceremony. The master replied: Figure 29. Naxi pictograph of a dancing dt?-mb? priest, holding a cymbal in his left and a double-sided drum in his right. Drawn by Mu Chen. Figure 30. Ritual dancing at a Qiang funeral: Drum in right hand and cymbal in left, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 31.

The motif of the exceptional birth of the first shaman and his particular relation to the yak can also be found in the mythology of the Naxi. There, the founder of the dt?-mb? religion, Dt?-mb? Shi-l?, is also born in the armpit of his mother (the pit of her left arm), and his birth is also overdue. He too talks to her from inside the belly, declaring that he will reject the normal birth passage, which he considers unclean. After the birth he performs several miraculous feats before settling down as a meditating hermit in a heavenly silk tent. When he is called down to earth by the people there, to protect them from the harrassments of a witch, he descends in the company of a yak, which carries his books and paraphernalia consisting of various objects: a trident, a cymbal, a hand-drum, a big drum, a thunderbolt dagger, an iron spear, a dancing sword, and a yak horn?a veritable panoply of ritual tools which would perfectly suit the Qiang sh?pi of today.16 The conch-shell trumpet. The conch-shell trumpet or map is a complementary instrument to the yak horn (fig. 33). As a rule, yellow triton shells are used to make it or a white conch shell Turbinella pyrum L, as found in the South China Sea. It is said that the sound of the conch shell trumpet will evoke the memory of the ancestors. Therefore it is blown in a ritual called "Remembering the Ancestors." According to shaman Xiao Yongqing, yak horns herald messages to heaven whereas conch-shell trumpets are blown mainly to the inhabitants of the eighteen stories of the underworld. A distinction on another level is made in an old Qiang saying, according to which "the shaman blows the yak horn and the Taoist priest blows the concha trumpet." This distinction may hint at formerly separate customs. Nowadays, however, one will find both Taoist and shamanic priests working hand in hand in most villages, and both functions are sometimes united in a single person. In reality, the sh?pi employs both the yak horn and the conch-shell trumpet alternatively?as does the Naxi dt?-mb? priest, who uses both yak horn and conch-shell trumpet in a number of ceremonies, including the ceremony "to propitiate the demons of suicide" and, more generally, in rituals to expel demons.17 Bells. Besides bells installed inside the drum or on the tip of the shaman's sacred wand, all in the shape of sleigh bells, I have seen only once a set of two spherical bells in a shaman's outfit (fig. 34). They were made of iron with pieces of cloth attached that functioned as handles and were employed, according to their owner Wang Zhisheng, to make noise directed against demons. Sticks and bladed weapons The sacred wand. The sacred wand of the Qiang shaman is called either shi gi wa tso or ser ko ta bo. Its size varies from 90 cm to 1 70 cm in length. Even though the specimens differ considerably in shape, it may be noted that all wands share three common characteristics: at the bottom is a sharp iron spearhead; the wand itself is a long, knotted rod of wood (usually peach-wood); and a knob at its top. This knob may be made of the same wood as the rod; in most cases, however, it is an attachment of iron or bronze. The iron knob may be fashioned as an anthropomorphic head, representing the "king of demons." This head points to the main function of the sacred wand?to banish demons?for it is said that the king of demons controls and commands the demons and keeps them at bay (fig. 35). According to an oral tradition: The mother of god Dizhanpusa had eaten dog's meat and was exiled for this reason to the eighteenth story of hell. Her son went to the Buddha of the West (Xifang Fozu) to borrow his sacred wand, shi gi wa tso. With the help of the wand he opened the gate of hell and rescued his mother. Since then the inhabitants of hell and all other demons are afraid of the sacred stick and, seeing it, run away. When the iron knob at the top of the wand is fashioned as a humanlike head representing the king of demons, a short iron chain of three to five links protrudes from the skull (fig. 36). The noise of these iron rings increases the frightening effect of the staff. In one case, the iron top of the staff consisted of a huge screw borrowed from an old Chinese truck?a modern abstraction of the king of demons (fig. 37). In the northwestern parts of Maoxian County the iron head at the top of the wand normally is replaced by other iron structures. The sacred staff of Xiao Yongqing at Erlicai village, for instance, ends in a tinkling tree of numerous iron rings displayed on several levels around a long nail 16. The Naxi pictograph for the Yak horn ^=^ clearly indicates that it is employed for acoustic messages. 1 7. According to their mythology, the conch-shell trumpet or ddv p'?r was born from a sexual union between a dragon and a snake spirit (Oppitz 1997:60f.). The Naxi pictograph for the conch-shell trumpet also indicates its acoustic usage: ^g^*.</page><page sequence="20">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 29 Figure 32.

This structure can be removed from the wooden stem and rammed into the soil as an ind?pendant tool to scare demons away. In the Yonghe area He Qingrong's staff and that of an old shaman of Napu village both end in an iron trident (figs. 38 and 39)?a remarkable extension of the Himalayan trisul, which, particularly in Nepal, is not simply an emblem of Siva, but also a frequently used object in many ritual traditions of the local shamans. Here among the Qiang, two thousand kilometers to the east, the trident dominates the top of the sacred wand, warding off the powers of hell. Underneath it, various iron rings generate the usual demon-frightening tinkling sound. He Qangrong's staff, in addition, is adorned from the iron structure downward with various woolen strings. In some cases, the staff is entwined by a wild vine that grew around the limb while it was alive. Coiling around the staff and ending at the top in a carved head of a snake, the significance of this ornamentation is obvious: Similar to the anthropomorphic head of the king of demons, the serpent that is wound around the staff helps to exorcise demons, for demons are extremely frightened by snakes (fig. 40). When a Qiang healer goes to his client, which in many cases may be a march of several hours through inhabited and wild territory, he employs his sacred wand as a walking stick (fig. 41). On the road he makes sure that the clatter of the iron rings can be heard, and when he has reached his destination point the sacred wand is put on guard on a visible spot of the ritual site. Figure 40. Sh?pi holding sacred wand with twine, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 41. Sh?pi He Qingrong walking to client with sacred wand, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz.</page><page sequence="23">32 RES 45 SPRING 2004 According to Graham, the Qiang shamans borrowed their staff from the Taoist sacred wand, which it closely resembles and is used for the same purpose?keeping evil influences away (Graham 1958:57). This conjecture of historical derivation could, with no less reason, also be inverted. A sacred wand is known to many Himalayan, Mongolian, and Siberian societies having shamanistic practices and ritual objects. Now, if one accepts that Qiang religion, apart from Buddhist, Taoist, Bon, and other influences, displays a strong shamanistic undercurrent, it may be argued on account of the enormous historical depth and continuity of Qiang culture that some of the shamanistic features may have influenced the formation of Taoist ones in the areas where both became neighbors, in the Min Shan Mountains of Sichuan. The iron rattle. Another instrument that can frighten away unwanted supernatural beings is the iron rattle, called hua ni (fig. 42). It consists of a large, hoop-like ring (with a diameter of approximately 18 cm) on which more than a dozen smaller rings are hung, some flattened, others left round. The large hoop ends at the bottom in a blade-like, rhombic handle. The handle is about one third longer than the diameter of the large hoop (approximately 27 cm). All parts are made of iron. Some colored threads of wool are tied to the large hoop-like ring. According to an old pictographic divination book found in the possession of one shaman, the iron rattle was invented by the younger brother of Taishang Laojun, a culture hero for both Taoist and Qiang shamans. The iron rattle is employed for two main purposes: The rattling of the small rings can frighten away ghosts, and with the help of the larger, hoop-like ring lost souls can be saved. On account of this assignment, the iron rattle is encountered particularly in a ritual to call back a lost soul. In the course of this ritual the shaman sits in his client's house, first to diagnose which force may have abducted the patient's soul; second, to determine where the missing soul may be hiding; third, to pull it back from its hiding place; and fourth, to tie it back to the body of its owner. In all these acts the iron rattle plays some part. First, it will be shaken by the shaman near the patient's body to drive away all ghosts that might cruise around him. Then the rattle is stuck into a wooden grain-measure filled with corn?an ambulant house altar erected for the rite by the shaman in the patient's house?to point out the ceremonial gifts (fig. 43). Later, the rattle together with paper flags is thrust into the ground at a crossroad outside the village (fig. 44), near offerings of pork meat, rice, and alcohol to keep the soul abductors outside the human living quarters. And finally, back in the client's house, after reconquering the soul and tying it with five-colored strings to the patient's hand, foot, and neck, the iron rattle jangles once more to shake off all remnant evil influences that might have followed the returning soul. Ceremonial knives. Many of the shaman's religious acts are belligerent in nature and many of his dealings with supernatural forces are actions of war. This can be deduced from the fact that some of his instruments are actually weapons. One such weapon is the knife, called xiu si. There are various types of knives used by the shaman: a short knife with a wooden hilt that is kept in a leather sheath with Chinese coins tied to it by a leather chain (fig. 45); a short sword kept in a sheath and hung on a belt in conjunction with various magical accessories (fig. 46); or a dancing sword called dse made of iron. The ceremonial knife is employed to kill sacrificial animals such as goats, sheep, or chicken. In the course of a ritual the act of killing is performed on the order of the presiding shaman by one of his assistants. But the knife may also be used in a more symbolical way?as a threatening tool. This is the case, for instance, in a ritual related to a death that happened outdoors. When someone has died in open country, his soul should be called back to the house in a special rite. In the course of this rite, the shaman will call the dead person's soul with certain incantations and killing movements made in the air with his ceremonial knife. These movements are addressed to those ghosts that have come in contact with the deceased person's soul. In a mythical tale, these menacing gestures are demonstrated: At the time when the Taoist god Beifangzhenwuzhushi was still a mortal human being, he was visited, while practicing religion in a cave, by a heavenly goddess named Wangmuniangniang, who appeared in the guise of a young lady. Although her intention was to help him, the hermit took her for a devil and drove her away with a knife. Thereupon she changed herself into an old woman and tried once more to offer her help. But again he threatened her with a knife. In this act both fell off a cliff. Beifang landed in a tree with his body hanging upside down; his belly changed into a tortoise devil and his intestines into a snake devil. Thanks to the intervention of Wangmuniangniang, who remained unhurt in the fall, his soul was raised up to heaven. From there he was ordered later by Guanyinpusa, Xifang Fozi (the Buddha of the West), and the Jade Emperor (Yuhuang Dadi) to subdue the two devils produced by his own body (i.e. the tortoise and the snake devil). This he accomplished with the help of a</page><page sequence="24">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 33 Figure 42. Iron rattle, employed to frighten away unwanted supernatural guests, 1998.

Following this myth, knife and seal belong to the same class of Qiang shamanic paraphernalia. The thunderbolt dagger. The phur bu, or thunderbolt dagger, also belongs to the order of weapons used to subdue demons. It is a well-known ritual tool in the Buddhist, Bon, and shamanic traditions of the Himalaya. In the Qiang ritual context this dagger is relatively rare. Its triangular blade and three-faced hilt are made of wood or iron. In ceremonial dances this magical weapon is wielded to drive out demons and to nail them down. This elementary function is implied in its Sanscrit name: kila or "nail."18 18.

Divination hoofs. The tools for a divination technique refered to as jiu gong ba gua consist normally of two pieces made of bamboo roots resembling the hoofs of a yak (fig. 47). The length of these pieces is about 8 cm, the width about 2 cm. One of the two pieces has eight carved notches, the other one nine notches. The former is referred to as yin, the latter as yang.

If one side points upward and one downward it is a positive sign, one of harmony between yin and yang. This kind of divination is frequent in Qiang shamanic practice. It is said to be borrowed from Taoism. Normally, the hoof divination is thrown three times in sequence, in some cases six times, and in rare cases only one time. It may be executed at the beginning of a ritual, in its full course, and toward the end. The styles of throwing depend on the individual shamans, but it is common practice that the hoof pieces be thrown upward? "skywards"?before they fall down?"earthwards" (figs. 48 and 49). The application is broad. For instance, in a single ritual performed for a person whose soul had been lost, we witnessed the hoof divination being done for a variety of purposes in rapid succession: first, to find out where the soul had been lost; second, which supernatural force had caused the loss; then, what the outcome of the ritual could be for the client; and finally, what the near future would bring in a more general way. As a rule, this divination is done in front of a house altar, near the incense burner. Besides bamboo roots, the divination pieces may also be made of the wood of a tree on which a person hung himself; or the wood of the central post of a millstone. In former days, however, the pieces were made of yak hoofs. This is the material of the prototype, as the myth already related in connection with the yak horn exemplified. According to Qiang imagery, the two divination pieces, whether of yak hoofs or wood, are said to form a yak horn when they are held together, and on account of this they may be classed with the yak horn. Figure 47. Divination hoofs with carved notches, 1998. Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. Divination strings. It is the aim of this divination technique to bind and unbind a set of strings so that a configuration results which permits a statement about prospects and future events.19 In Xiao Yongqing's set the individual strings are about 20 cm long and each ends in a red-cloth bobble (fig. 50). At the other end they are bound together to form a bunch. This technique is not the original skill of a shaman, duangong, or sh?pi, but that of a diviner called guashi or mu ma. A shaman may combine both functions in his person. According to old master He Qingrong, it takes two years of learning to become expert in tying and untying knots. He gives occasional lessons to his pupils, for instance on the eve of the spring festival. The knot divination is often employed in connection with an arrangement of twelve articles. First, some juniper branches are burnt in the room, the shaman begins to chant, puts a red sheet of paper on the floor, deposits eight glazed god figures into a grain measure serving as an altar in front of the paper, and then starts to tie and untie knots. Every time he has untied a knot 19. In Chinese, this method is called shenggua (tying knots divination). The Qiang call it she l?. According to Xiao Yongqing, the shaman of Erlicai, the string divination is called "divination with five strings."</page><page sequence="27">36 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 48. Yak hoof divination?"skywards," 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 49. Yak hoof divination?"earthwards," 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. he asks one of his pupils to take one object from a bamboo plate and place it on the red paper. These objects are deposited in three rows until there are three times thirteen, or thirty-nine pieces on the floor (fig. 51). There are twelve different articles for the three rows of thirteen pieces: stone, bamboo roots, pine nuts, fragments of a broken bowl, bracelets, bones, slices of cow hide, black beans, bamboo sprouts, white beans, walnuts, and pottery pieces. To each of the articles is attributed a specific lexical meaning. Thus stone means firm or steady; an immaculate bamboo root stands for good luck, and a knobby one for bad luck; a pine nut will promise money for a young man, and bad health for an old man; a piece of a broken bowl predicts death; a bracelet representing water means unsteady luck; a bone signifies domestic animals; a white bean, because of its color, indicates that someone will die?white being the color of mourning; a walnut means loss of soul when one goes out in the year of one's cyclic animal; a black bean foretells eye trouble; a piece of bamboo brings luck in one's marriage and lovely children. The twelve articles, deposited in three rows of thirteen pieces each are also read in connection with the twelve cyclic animals: mouse, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, and pig. Divination with strings is known also to other Tibeto-Burman societies along the Sino-Tibetan borderland of Sichuan and Yunnan. Thus, the Naxi of northern Yunnan, who claim to be descendants of the Qiang, are acquainted with a divination technique they call mu?n-ss? ss?w-ss?-sso (rolling strings) in which nine cords are rolled between the palms of the hand,</page><page sequence="28">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 37 Figure 50.

Among the various other divination techniques of the Qiang, one deserves to be mentioned here: the divination with the one-sided drum. The technique is as follows: When celebrating the ancestral deity in front of a spruce tree in a sacred forest with fellow shamans, the head officiant asks an assistant to hold the drum in a horizontal position with the membrane pointing upward, while he scatters barley seeds on the sheep-skin membrane. Then the drum is passed over to him and he beats it. The seeds, moved by the vibration of the drum skin, will dance in various directions (fig. 52). The pattern that they form, or the spot where they fall off the frame of the drum, can then be interpreted as a predictory statement. It may be noted Figure 53. Drum divination of Magar shaman, Nepal, 1981. Photo: Michael Oppitz. that similar forms of drum divination have been registered in Tibet and among various shamanic traditions in Nepal (fig. 53). Divination books. It is time to mention, if only in passing, the peculiar books of the Qiang shamans, of which only a few have outlasted the destructive tides of the Cultural Revolution. The only remaining exemplars I have seen are the two books owned by one shaman who hid them for years from the iconoclastic vigor of the young guards, by burying them at a secret spot in the soil. Both books are leporellos in vertical format, seventy eight and eighty pages long, respectively, and painted on both sides with figurative drawings and abstract signs. The latter are in the minority, consisting of geometrical and non-geometrical symbols. The figurative drawings include depictions of everyday and religious objects, natural phenomena, heavenly bodies, plants, animals, and human and supernatural beings. The arrangement of these over the pages follows an ordered plan, inscribed in the logic of a divinatory system and exposing in certain sections the semantic sequence of narratives. Both books are kept in a leather case that is laced up with brown shoe-strings (fig. 54) and locked with the help of an old Chinese coin, which has a square hole in the center. The leather case with the books inside, highly venerated by the owner and lay people alike, is frequently carried to shamanic s?ances, along with other paraphernalia, without being consulted. The presence of the books in their case suffices to spread a beneficial atmosphere. This may be due to the fact that no one is 20. The Naxi attribute this divination technique to their immediate neighbors to the north, the Moso, who also are believed to have branched off from the Qiang. The string divination is represented in Naxi pictographs thus: ^. Another type of reading the future from knots and attributed to the Tibetans is called "tying and untying Tibetan strings" {gv-dzu k'o-dt?r-p'?r) and is noted down by the following pictograph: ^ . Divination with colored strings is reported in Tibet from pre-Buddhist times. According to an ancient source, the Grub m'ta sel-gyi me-long, it is said that a Bon priest was called to attend the funerary rituals for the mythical king Gri-gum bcan-po and to divine with multicolored oracle strings, a technique known as ju tig (grasping a cord). In the Mongolian epos a soothsayer is mentioned who draws a lot with red strings (Hoffmann 1950:193).</page><page sequence="30">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 39 able to understand the books fully any more or to employ them as divinatory tools. This is at least the case with the pupils of the book's owner. Nevertheless, I have started to decipher them with the old man and to decode their underlying system. In my opinion, these books are important documents for various reasons: the pictures and picture sequences of which they are composed can be read as an illustrated ethnography, as a handbook of visual anthropology in its own indigenous right; they inform us about a local form of religious knowledge, in particular divination; as such, these divination books invite comparison with other divination texts and practices, such as those of the neighboring Jiarong, Yi, Moso, Naxi, Tibetans, and Chinese; they may contribute to the explanation of the transition of pictures into writing, in particular the historical development of a pictographic system such as the one invented by the Naxi dt?-mb? priests with whom the Qiang sh?pi share so many features; and finally, they may provide a clue to certain migrations in the wake of which former Qiang groups split off into new ethnic identities, such as the Moso and Naxi.21 Printed charms Wooden printing boards. In one of the painted Qiang divination books a priest, who from the type of hat he is wearing can be identified as a Taoist, is holding a wooden board in his left hand while in his right he holds a long knife (fig. 55). The board was called ling pal "v f? (printing board) by the owner of the book; in combination with the knife it protects all that is valuable to its owner. On another page of the same book it is Taishang Laojun himself who lifts such a board while riding on a dragon. As these boards with their carved Chinese letters unmistakably represent a cultural tradition based on writing, their origin must be sought outside the oral transmissions of the shamans. All local people questioned agreed that it is the Taoist background from which these boards come. The boards are used for printing charms on paper. In the hands of the shamans who have integrated them into their canonical sets of paraphernalia, these printing boards have a slightly fetishized aura. They usually come in pairs (fig. 56). The Chinese characters carved into such boards carry messages such as this one: Figure 54. Book case of Qiang divination book, 1998. Photo: Michael Oppitz. "Effective order of the Buddhist deity: Ghosts and demons go away!" Whether it is the written words of the spell or the printing plate as an object that produces such spells, in either case these boards are used as magic charms. When, for instance, an unnatural, in other words a premature death has occurred in a household, the printing blocks are employed to make prints on yellow paper which are stuck on every door of the house to protect its inhabitants against possible attacks of the dead person's roaming ghost. Seals. Another object in the shaman's set of equipment connected with writing is a brass or iron seal composed of elaborate reliefs of Chinese characters, to be printed as charms on paper. These seals known locally by their Chinese name yin ?P resemble in size and style those used by Chinese Buddhist and Taoist priests and by Chinese magicians (fig. 57). The origin story of the seal has already been mentioned in connection with that of the knife, according to which the original seal was given to the Taoist deity Beifangzhenwuzhushi in the shape of his own lotus seat by the Jade Emperor so that he could conquer the tortoise and the snake devils. In the mythical tale, the present-day function of the seal is already foretold: to ban demons. In one of the divinatory picture books discovered by us, a seal is reproduced on one of the colophon pages?not printed, but painted with a brush. It reproduces the signet of Taishang Laojun, identified with the famous pilgrim Xuanzang, bringer of Buddhist scriptures from India to China. 21. As I plan to publish a facsimile edition of the two Qiang divination picture books found in 1998 along with ethnographic commentaries, I will not go into them here in further detail.</page><page sequence="31">40 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 55.

Ling pai or wooden printing board, 1998. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Magic accessories Wrapped monkey head. As already noted in connection with the ceremonial attire of the shamans, the Qiang have a very special relation to the golden haired monkey. From its skin a crown-like hat is fabricated displaying on the front the features of a monkey face. A corresponding myth delivers the model and explains the reason for this intimacy between sh?pi and monkey (see p. 13). As mentioned in previous ethnographic accounts, every Qiang sh?pi has a patron deity by the name of abba mula (father god), or abba mo lo si or just mo lo sei, sometimes also refered to as ndjei tsu or nyei dzu (Hu 1941:15, 25; Stein 1957:8; and Graham 1942:88; 1958:51). This patron or tutelary deity is the guardian, instructor, and adviser of the Qiang priest, without whom he would be fighting a losing battle. This patron deity is materialized in the skull of a golden-haired monkey wrapped in various layers of paper; the image is equally called abba mula. Inside the bundle of paper are kept dried pieces of the lungs, liver, intestines, lips, and</page><page sequence="32">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 41 Figure 58. A monkey skull?image of the sh?pi's patron deity, 1998. Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. nails of the monkey's "five organs." At the top end of the bundle the monkey skull is looking out, while the bottom end is tied up (fig. 58). The eye sockets are filled with cowrie shells representing the eyes. It is said that the paper wrappings should never be removed, for they attest the skull's sacredness. In fact, with every large ritual, formerly held in a sacred grove, a new sheet of white paper is added around the head of the monkey so that, by counting the layers, one is informed about the number of important rituals held by the owner. As they visualize the ritual activities of the shaman, the paper wrappings also communicate his accomplishments. Noticably, the inner layers are often quite yellowed and brittle. Some sh?pi will not allow any other person to touch the ?mage of their patron deity, keeping the wrapped monkey skull at a sacred place in the innermost part of their house. They take it out only when they are called to some important ceremony, carrying the bundle with precautionary care (fig. 59). Moreover, before they go out with it into the public, they first wash their hands and then worship the bundle in secret. Occasions for moving the monkey icon may be a ritual to expel bad luck or a special worship of the abba mula in a sacred grove of spruce trees (Hu 1941:22). The spruce is a sacred tree, for spruce forests are the preferred abode of the golden-haired monkey. When the shaman dances on such occasions, his movements will imitate those of the monkeys. When a lay person has caught a golden Figure 59. Sh?pi Zhang Fuliang carrying a wrapped monkey skull in his left hand, 2000. Photo: Michael Oppitz. haired monkey, he will try to find out which shaman is in need of a monkey head. After killing the animal, he will bring the head to the gate of the sh?pi's house. With firecrackers the house owner will salute the arrival of the monkey and its bearer, then take the head inside the house and burn juniper and worship the new image of his tutelary deity. The person who brought the monkey head will then be feasted in the shaman's house with an opulent banquet. As such heads are rare, a shaman may bequeath his wrapped monkey skull to one of his pupils. Such an heirloom is kept with the utmost veneration. In some areas, as in Sanlong village, Maoxian County, the golden monkey is considered to be the founder of the human race. He is the primordial forebear, the ancestor. On</page><page sequence="33">42 RES 45 SPRING 2004 account of this attribution, not only as patron and instructor but also as genealogical ancestor, the golden haired monkey and his symbolical image, the wrapped monkey skull, may be linked to the ancestral deity of the Qiang, called abba sei, the male ancestor, who is worshipped inside the house in one leg of the tripod, the other two legs representing afa sei, the female ancestor, and mo bo sei, the god of the kitchen fire. A more profane explanation for the high esteem of the monkey is the outstanding beauty of the golden-haired species and the fact that it can move with such ease from place to place, an ability also longed for by the performing shaman. In Qiang divination books the monkey features in various passages. In one book the picture of a monkey alludes to a story in which he destroys a heavenly palace; another book addresses a monkey's trip to a western land, where he acquires written texts. In both cases the monkey Sun Wukong of popular literature and protagonist of the novel Xi yu ji, who escorts the Tang pilgrim Xuanzang, stands as the model. This character's association with the acquisition of books and the role a golden-haired monkey plays in a Qiang myth as the inventor of the drum replacing the lost scriptures, suggests that the paper which is wrapped around the venerated monkey skull may also be interpreted as a hint to the conflict between scriptural versus oral tradition at the intersection of which the monkey stands as a mediator. For the Qiang who, apart from their rare picture books, have no writing and no written traditions of their own, a monkey dealing with books must certainly be endowed with supernatural qualities. Deified, it helps the Qiang come to terms with this self acknowledged cultural deficiency. In this way the monkey skull accomplishes two things at once: embodying a tutelary deity, abba mula, it makes it tangible; and it symbolizes the kowtaw of a non-literal society toward a civilization based on writing. As such it is an object of magical radiation. The poison king. There are a number of other implements in the sh?ph outfit that have the aura of magic power. One is called poison king or tzegarbe, the external body of which is a leather bag, which is filled with various kinds of feathers and animal hairs and may have attached to its leather strap a variety of horns?blue sheep, antelope, and wild goat (fig. 60). This bag embodies a supernatural being, the poison king, and is treated as such. In curing diseases, especially those caused by poisonous ghosts, the sh?pi must worship the poison king to win his support. And in an initiation ceremony for a prospective new shaman, the poison king has to be invited and offered refreshments. According to myth, the poison king in his bag was originally hung on a tree, then moved to a defensive tower, a fortification typical for many Qiang villages. In an earthquake the fortification tower collapsed and the poison king fell in distress. Not to remain isolated, he has to be included at an initiation ceremony into the company of the assembled shamans. While they are chanting collectively their ritual texts, an echo is heard from inside the leather bag. This is the signal for one of the priests to shoulder the bag and start dancing with it, a dance then joined in by the rest of the sh?pi present. When the dancers reach the place of the main ceremony, the poison king is asked to drink through a bamboo pipe held into the bag. Only then the shamans start drinking themselves, calling on the gods of the various Qiang tribes (Hu 1941:46). A skein of bones, skulls, claws, and iron pieces. A very powerful magic accessory is a string of bones, mainly of predators, called locally fun ni ma. It consists of a leopard's skull, eagle's claws, wolf's teeth, and monkey bones, lined together in a row (fig. 61). Some iron disks and metal plates, looking like miniature shields, and some thin iron rings and leather strings may be added to the arrangement. I have seen this tool worn by the shaman He Qingrong in a ritual to call back the soul of a client. While he performed a divination for the patient, he kept the tun ni ma over his left shoulder.22 An accessory quite similar to the one described above is one called wa shar in the existing literature (Hu 1941:16). It consists of a bundle of claws, paws, teeth, and bones of birds and beasts, bundled up with a leather belt and employed for magical treatment in cases of epidemy, in curing other diseases, and in exorcism. Another magical instrument of the same category is called szege ra in the Qiang language. Using an animal's horn as a trunk, this instrument has many objects hanging around it such as a wild beast's bones, paws, and teeth and old coins. It is used in a sacrificial ceremony to chase away dirty things and to summon 22. Whether this implement is the same as the one called by Graham "a sacred bundle/' I am unable to say. But from the description of its constituent parts this may be the case. The sacred bundle included: horns of wild mountain goats, scapulas and other bones of small animals and birds, shoulder blades, feet and claws of hawks and eagles, tusks of wild boars, bears, leopards, tigers, and musk deer, halves of sea shells, horsebells, and Chinese brass or bronze, coinlike charms (Graham 1958:57).</page><page sequence="34">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 43 Figure 60. Bag of the "poison king," 1998. Photo: Wolfgang Wenning. Figure 61. A skein of bones, skulls, claws, and iron pieces, 1998. Photo: Michael Oppitz. Figure 62.

Photo: Michael Oppitz. lost souls (Hu 1941:16). In one district, so the British missionary Torrance recalls, "the priests carry, hung from their girdles, a bunch of ludicrously weird objects called Te-sa-a-ga. Anything that is curious or strange enough or suggestive may find a place in the collection. Together they make a rare rattle for the ignorant and gullible. You may see an eagle's bill, a cock's foot, a wild boar's tusk, a goat's horn, a bit of bone, a cymbal, deer's teeth, a Chinese charm cash, or a rare shell. Each object proclaims the exorcist powers of its possession. With these by his side, no one can doubt his ability to recall the soul in sickness, undo demonic powers and save you in general from the evil eye" (Torrance 1933:42 and 1937:82). Two magical accessories strung together on cord, which I saw in the possession of shaman Yang Shudong, although less numerous and diverse in their constituent elements than the ones described above, could qualify for either the wa shar or the sze ge ra arrangements. One assembled the horn of a blue sheep and various monkey bones (fig. 62). The other consisted of the shinbone of a monkey, a set of bear's (or leopard's?) teeth, a set of drilled-through cowrie shells, and a stone ring, all held together on a string (fig. 63). According to their owner, the bones and teeth of the predators are meant to induce fear into evil spirits and to drive them away while the monkey bones are meant to increase the shaman's mobility. Antelope horns. Horns of the Tibetan antelope Panthrolops hodgsoni, whose habitat extends from Qinghai to the borders of Kashmir, are used by the</page><page sequence="35">44 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Qiang sh?pi mainly to exorcise demons. The horns may be attached to one of the previously described sets of magical tools or employed on their own. When a person feels pain in his hand, leg, eye, or back, the sh?pi will touch the affected part with the tip of the naturally notched antelope horn and then stick the point of the horn into the soil. While repeating over and over some magical charms, he will pour water into the affected ground, until he considers the action completed (Graham 1958:58). Soldiers of god. A last group of magical accessories that I saw consist of a set of glazed porcelain figures representing human and animal warriors, locally known as baima or "soldiers of god" (fig. 64). They remind one of chessmen on account of their size and the small socle on which they stand. In the healing rituals of He Qingrong, where I have seen them employed, they are placed inside a wooden grain measure which serves as an ambulant altar and is filled with corn, rice, or grain. These warriors are meant to support the sh?pi in his fight against malignant forces.23 Conclusion The foregoing article is primarily an exercise in descriptive ethnography. As an inventory it assembles all information the author was able to collect on the ritual paraphernalia of the Qiang religious specialist called sh?pi and appends to these findings the scattered notes in published sources. The resulting picture can be summarized in a few strokes. Located at a crossroad of Tibetan, Chinese, and several Sino-Tibetan tribal societies, Qiang culture, as embodied in its material objects, reflects this condition. As has been documented, some of the religious objects used by the sh?pi bear the mark of Chinese, in particular Taoist provenance, such as the divination hoofs, the bells, the soldiers of god, the seals and printing boards. Others are of Tibetan origin, either Buddhist or Bon, such as the five-lobed crown, the double-sided drum, the cymbal, the thunderbolt dagger, the yak horn, and the conch-shell trumpet. Some of the objects can be related directly to specific ethnic groups, as for instance the leopard-skin jacket and some transcendental sound instruments are linked to the Naxi, whose religion combines also Bon, Buddhist, and shamanist elements. Other ritual accessories such as the necklaces; a number of magical pendants with animal bones, skulls, claws, horns, and iron pieces; the sacred wand; the divination strings; and, above all, the one-sided drum can be identified as local variants belonging to a wider, pan-Himalayan and Siberian shamanist tradition. Some of the paraphernalia, finally, may be described as genuine inventions of the Qiang, such as the monkey-skin hat, the wrapped monkey head, the iron rattle, and the divinatory picture books. But even these?with the exception of the picture books?can be assigned to a more general class of shamanist outfit. It is, therefore, fully justified?taking the ritual objects as material pieces of evidence?to classify the local religion of the Qiang as shamanistic. As such it partakes of a vast transformational system extending over large parts of the Asian continent. It is characteristic for this system?usually labelled as "shamanism"?that manifestations of the same kind are never identical. Wherever a ceremony is performed, a myth is chanted, or a ritual object is employed, one can be sure that it is unique. This applies not only for the various tribal shamanisms as compared to one another, but also to any local form of shamanism within a single ethnic unit. As for the ritual objects, this means that they are subject to a firm rule of serial metamorphosis. All one-sided drums, all sacred wands, and so forth can be identified as belonging to a common kind, and yet two single exemplars will certainly differ. This observation cannot be explained exclusively by the fact that the instruments' mode of production is pre-industrial. It is equally due to the individualist nature of shamanic cultural expression. Qiang ritual objects illustrate this. Acknowledgements I would like to thank the following Qiang religious specialists (sh?pi) for their generosity in sharing their knowledge with us during our visits: Wang Zhisheng, Yang Maoshan, Yang Shudong, Wang Jiuqing, Zhang Fuliang, Ren Yongqing, Xiao Xongqing, Long Gouzhi, and master He Qingrong. I am also grateful to the Naxi scholar He Limin for his companionship on one of the trips and Wolfgang Wenning (as cameraman) for his on both. Above all my thanks go to "Jackie" Zhao Xiuyun, who helped me to understand what the old shamans were telling us and who allowed me to complement my fieldnotes with hers; I hope that she will?as the first female Naxi ethnographer ever?write up her own story of the Qiang in the near future. 23. I am not sure if the word baima used for these "soldiers of god" is connected with the Baima White Horse ethnic group living north of the Qiang or whether it could be connected with the baima, a sort of priest of the Hani tribe to the south.</page><page sequence="36">Oppitz: Ritual objects of the Qiang shamans 45 Figure 64.
