BURGER and LUCY SALAZAR-BURGER During the second millennium b.c., a growing population of farmers in the lower valleys of the Peruvian coast built dozens of massive architectural complexes. The number and scale of these Initial Period centers was rarely equaled in Andean prehistory. Investigations at such Initial Period sites suggest that their primary purpose was to provide settings for religious rituals and social gatherings of the small-scale societies occupying the valleys. These sites are characterized by large open plazas for public assemblies and terraced platforms and pyramids topped by a variety of chambers, patios, and other settings for religious ceremonies. Little is known of these ceremonies, but our recent discovery of a puppetlike effigy at one of these sites, Mina Perdida, offers clues to some of the activities that occurred on pyramid summits at such Initial Period centers. Studies at these centers along the Peruvian coast are still in their infancy, and few sites have been studied in depth. Nevertheless, the work carried out thus far already suggests the difficulties of reconstructing the ceremonies carried out either in the plazas or in the smaller, more intimate spaces on the pyramid summits. Foremost among these difficulties are the obstacles created by the patterns of artifact discard or, more exactly, patterns of curating items utilized in the rituals and the maintenance of ritual environments free of refuse. In short, the very items necessary to detect the ceremonial behavior at these Initial Period centers have been systematically removed from their ritual environments. The reasons for doing this varied. In many cases, reuse of the paraphernalia may have been planned while, in other cases, the sacred items were destined for reuse at a later time, disposal in a special archaeological context, or disposal as secondary refuse elsewhere. The authors express their gratitude to Peru's Instituto Nacional de Cultura for permission to carry out excavations at Mina Perdida and to Dr. Luis Watanabe and the staff of the Museo de la Naci?n in Lima for their support in conserving and restoring the sacred effigy. The investigations were supported by funding from the Heinz Foundation, the Fisher Foundation, and Yale University. The fieldwork involved the participation of residents from the Lurin Valley, archaeology students from Yale, San Marcos, Cornell, and the Universidad Cat?lica (PUC), and archaeologists Jose Pinilla and Bernadino Ojeda. These obstacles are by no means unique to the Andes; in fact, they are common throughout the world. Nevertheless, in his overview of the processes of archaeological site formation, Michael Schiffer (1996:48) observed that artifacts with important symbolic functions sometimes become obsolete and can be discarded. For example, some "sacred" objects are deliberately thrown out after their use in New Guinea and New Ireland. It is implied but not made explicit in Schiffer's statement that objects that hold symbolic importance more commonly are not discarded and consequently are not found in the systemic context in which they were used. A related and cross-culturally observed pattern is that even those symbolically charged items that are no longer needed for their original functions may have become so closely linked to their original transcendent purpose that they are not disposed of in the ways that utilitarian objects are. One possible solution is to completely destroy such objects when their ritual purpose has been completed. Until very recently, the Nyau secret society of the Chewa culture in Malawi, for example, burned the masks used in the initiation and funerary rituals at the end of each ceremonial season, and its members produced new ones the following year (Deborah Kaspin, pers. comm., 1998). Similar accounts of destroying ceremonial paraphernalia (sometimes by discard in lakes or forest rather than by fire) have been recorded in many parts of Africa and the Pacific. The widespread tendency to curate sacred objects and paraphernalia over long periods of time derives in part from the supernatural power associated with them. Even during their use lives, the sacrality of these items often requires that they be kept apart in special circumstances physically removed from the mundane materials used in daily life. Two common solutions are storage in special facilities in the community or in areas outside of the settlement. For example, the Warao near the mouth of the Orinoco have specialized structures or sanctuaries in which a sacred stone, wooden images, and ritual paraphernalia belonging to the priest-shaman are kept out of public view in baskets and boxes (Wilbert 1972:79-80). Similarly, in sub-Saharan Africa, non-Christian groups frequently keep religious objects wrapped in cloth and placed in baskets and boxes</page><page sequence="3">30 RES 33 SPRING 1998 within special buildings or shrines. Such structures were closed to the public except on special religious holidays (Michelle Gilbert, pers. comm., 1997). These concerns with the care of sacred paraphernalia are likewise addressed by the Roman Catholic Church in its sacristy, a room in which the priest's vestments are kept along with chalices and other ritual objects. In many societies, sacred objects do not fully lose their power even when they are damaged and can no longer function as originally intended. Notions of the residual sacred power associated with them creates difficulties for their disposal. The Spanish extirpators of idolatry observed that pagan religious objects in the Andes had to be completely obliterated since even fragments of the original objects were believed to contain the spark of sacred power and could themselves become the object of worship if they survived. These difficulties in dealing with the discard of symbolically charged items are by no means confined to cultures of the distant past or to the "traditional" societies that have been the focus of ethnography. Jews, for example, have religious laws governing the storage and burial of worn out holy books and ritual objects. Sacred relics, usually fragments of holy individuals (for example, saints) or objects (for example, the Cross) remain important sources of power for many Orthodox and Roman Catholic worshippers in contemporary churches, and some relics have been curated by churches since Medieval times. While some relics were occasionally stolen or sold as valuable commodities, they were not discarded (Geary 1986). Given the cross-cultural patterning concerning the treatment of sacred objects noted here, it is not surprising that the excavation of ritual contexts in the Andes and elsewhere rarely unearths the paraphernalia and cult objects that played central roles in religious ceremonies. This is certainly the case for the centers of the Initial Period. A second pattern of discard that creates an obstacle for approaching Initial Period ceremonial life is the absence of refuse left from the ceremonies. It has been suggested elsewhere (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1985:115-116) that the removal of primary refuse in the quest for a state of cleanliness underlies the paucity of materials recovered from floors in areas of ritual activity. Long ago, Mary Douglas recognized that although each culture has its own notions of dirt and defilement, there are cross-cultural regularities that derive from the nature of refuse itself. She writes: In its earliest stage, where the identity of its bits still have some identity, they are recognizably out of place and consequently a threat to good order observed. Their half identity still clings to them and the clarity of the scene in which they obtrude is impaired by their presence. Douglas 1966:160 Given the meticulous care usually taken in ceremonial environments in order to create controlled settings evocative of sacred time and space, it is not surprising that broken fragments from completed ceremonies and other activities are almost always systematically removed and deposited in places where their presence is not disruptive, distracting, or disturbing. While these two site formation processes, the curating (or complete destruction) of symbolically important items and the elimination of in situ refuse stemming from ceremonial activities, create considerable difficulties for an empirically based consideration of Initial Period ritual activities, there remain other potential sources of evidence. For example, the religious iconography that decorates the structures themselves is nonportable and thus may be unearthed in its original setting unless it is intentionally mutilated or violently removed by later groups, or destroyed naturally by the elements. Such "decorative" features in the architecture may be particularly germane to the study of the ceremonies in question since they often represent the divine or mythological basis for the religious ideologies practiced in those environments and even for the ceremonies themselves. For example, a rare glimpse into the ceremonial life of the late Initial Period is provided by the frieze of sculptures decorating the walls of the circular plaza in the Old Temple at Chavin de Huantar in highland Peru. Roughly contemporaneous with the final occupation at the coastal sites of Mina Perdida and Cardal, these stone carvings show a procession of costumed anthropomorphic figures approaching the central staircase from both sides of the built environment (Burger 1992:133-135; Lumbreras 1977). The figures are dressed in elaborate garb, including bracelets and anklets, perhaps of precious metals, body ornaments apparently of feathers, and distinctive headdresses, at least one of which incorporates the tail of a jaguar. Some carry musical instruments, including some made of strombus shell, and they appear to blow these trumpets. They also carry weapons such as darts and clubs. If these images depict supernatural or historic</page><page sequence="4">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 31 figures that provide the mythological charter for ritual activities, it is possible that many of these features would have appeared in the ceremonies themselves. This possibility receives indirect empirical support from the discovery of actual strombus shell trumpets in burials and other Chavin contexts (Burger 1992; Onuki 1995:15, pis. 10-11 ). Of course, feather ornaments, woven slings, and many other items central to ritual were organic and highly perishable, thus ruling out their survival in environments like Chavin de Huantar. Yet even the more resistant materials (that is, shells, precious metals, and so on) were nowhere to be found when the Plaza at Chavin was excavated by Luis Lumbreras in 1969. Only a scattering of broken pottery, probably deposited after the Plaza was no longer in use, was recovered on its floor (Lumbreras 1977). Without the decorative friezes cut in stone, we would have little sense of the rich ceremonial life that was carried out at the Old Temple. Returning to Peru's central coast, investigations at Initial Period centers in the Rimac and Lurin Valleys have likewise yielded few remains that would allow us to imagine the nature of the ceremonies that were carried out in the built environments at these sites. The architect Carlos Williams observed that along the central coast, public centers dating to the Formative have ground plans laid out with a U-shaped pattern consisting of a terraced pyramid and lower terraced platforms surrounding a large central plaza on three sides. All of them were oriented to the east of north, although there is considerable variation between the azimuths of the central axes of the centers. He identified some twenty of these complexes (Williams 1985:228-234, fig. 1), but his preliminary estimate based largely on aerial photographs now appears to have significantly underestimated the total number of complexes. In the lower Lurin Valley, for example, Williams identified three U-shaped centers, but subsequent field research has shown that there were at least six (fig. 1). Thus far, the investigations at U-shaped centers in several valleys suggest that all of them began to be built during the Initial Period (1800 B.c-800 b.c. [uncalibrated ages]). As Williams observed, the U-shaped centers of the Lurin, Rimac, Chill?n, and Chancay drainages are strikingly similar in their basic components and they are widely assumed to have shared in a single cultural tradition during the Initial Period. The artistic and Figure 1. Map showing the location of U-shaped centers in the Lurin Valley. Map: Bernadino Ojeda and Richard Burger. architectural tradition developed in this region was one of several sources of inspiration for the highland Chavin style (Burger 1992, Williams 1985), and chronologically these U-shaped coastal centers all predate the emergence of the Chavin horizon. Of the Initial Period centers on the central coast, the best known are Garagay in the Rimac Valley and Cardal in the Lurin Valley. Excavations of interior rooms designed for religious rituals have been carried out at both centers and a brief consideration of the results provides useful background for the present study. At</page><page sequence="5">32 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Garagay, summit buildings were unearthed on the central pyramid (Mound B) and the northeastern platform mound (Mound A), and in both cases, clay friezes were found to adorn the environments. On the main pyramid, the interior walls of the midsized atrium, which measured 24 m on a side, was decorated with polychrome images of anthropomorphic arachnids and geometric forms (Burger 1992, Salazar-Burger and Burger 1983, Ravines 1984, Ravines and Isbell 1976). The prominence of enlarged canines (or fangs) and the unnatural combination of human and animal features strongly suggests the mythical and supernatural nature of these motifs. Iconographie study of Formative representations of the supernatural arachnid has linked it to a cosmology focused on death, fertility, and rainfall (Salazar-Burger and Burger 1983). The geometric motif that alternates with these supernatural figures at Garagay combines a stepped-block element with a curvilinear element, perhaps fusing symbols referring to the mountains and ocean. In later Andean cultures, these geographic features were intimately linked in a single cosmology in which water cycled from the oceans to the mountains and then back again, thereby justifying offerings made at mountain peaks to influence the patterns of rainfall (Reinhard 1985). While the motifs decorating Garagay's summit chamber suggest the possible focus of the rituals that were carried out in it during the late Initial Period, Ravines and Isbell (1976) report nothing recovered on the floor of the chamber itself that might help flesh out the ceremonies conducted there. Some items of religious significance, which will be discussed later in this article, were dug out during the chamber's excavation, but these belonged to intentional fills and the sem?subterranean sockets that supported wooden posts. These items have been treated as votive offerings in sacred locations rather than as elements used in the ceremonies themselves. The clay wall decorations in Mound A likewise show stylized images with strong symbolic content, particularly the monochrome motifs on a series of pilasters; these bas-relief sculptures combine anthropomorphic with masklike feline, avian, and other elements (Ravines 1984). Excavations at Cardal revealed patterns that resemble those of Garagay in many respects. On the central pyramid (referred to as sector IIIA), an atrium was located at the mound's summit. As at Garagay, a massive and steep central staircase led up to a shallow landing that, in turn, provided access through an entryway into the atrium area. While the landing would have been visible from the plaza, the activities inside of the atrium were not. Unlike the situation at Garagay, the unpainted interior walls of the Cardal atrium were decorated only with a plain raised band. However, the highly visible landing outside the atrium was decorated with a polychrome relief sculpture of a large-toothed mouth with prominent canines. The style of the mouth matches that used in other representations of supernatural figures and strongly suggests the religious character of the activities carried out in the atrium chamber behind it. Once more, however, excavation of the floor of this room (known as the Middle Atrium) and a similar and later chamber constructed above it (known as the Late Atrium) showed little direct evidence of the ceremonies conducted there. One exception was the reburial of a series of human bodies in the floor of the Middle Atrium at the moment when the room was being filled to make possible the construction of the Late Atrium. While this was clearly an event of major religious importance and considerable symbolic meaning, likely associated with the veneration of ancestors (cf. Burger and Salazar Burger 1991), it was a singular ceremonial episode and was fundamentally different from the more standard and repetitive ceremonial activities for which the built environment was designed. A similar staircase-landing atrium arrangement is believed to exist on the terraced pyramid on the northeast of Cardal's main plaza and test excavations in this area by Scheele revealed a repetitive wave decoration similar to the one at Garagay (Scheele 1970:177-178, fig. 8A). Subsequent excavations at Cardal by the authors relocated this frieze and revealed that it occurs on the exterior walls of an atrium. Like the altar at Cardal (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1991:280 281) and the iconography at Garagay, this stylized form seems to point to religious ceremonies concerned with the forces imminent in the ocean and mountains and, by extension, in the powers controlling rainfall and fertility that were associated with these natural features in Andean cosmology. This article focuses on a rare example of late-Initial Period religious paraphernalia that was discovered at Mina Perdida in 1994 by Yale University's Proyecto Arqueol?gico Lurin. The object in question is a sculpted and painted anthropomorphic effigy with movable arms and legs. Made of perishable materials, it was only preserved as a result of the arid conditions of the Peruvian coast and the specific context and manner of its disposal. In the following sections, its discovery will</page><page sequence="6">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 33 be summarized, the object will be described in detail, and its significance for understanding late-Initial Period ritual life will be explored. The archaeological site of Mina Perdida Before focusing on the discovery of the sacred effigy, it is germane to offer a brief description of the archaeological site in which it was found so that its context can be more fully appreciated. Mina Perdida (PV48-11 7) is by far the largest of the six U-shaped centers in the lower Lurin Valley (fig. 1). Located on a natural terrace above the valley bottom and 100 m above sea level, the site lies 8 km from the shores of the Pacific. In contrast, it was only 1 km away from the small and now destroyed U-shaped center of Parka and 3 km from the mid-sized U-shaped center of Cardal. The prehistoric remains at Mina Perdida cover roughly 30 ha (hectares); about half of this area is occupied by public architecture (fig. 2). The site is dominated by a central platform mound that rises 23 m in height. This structure was a terraced pyramid with a massive central staircase, and on its leveled summit there were elaborate colonnades and freestanding structures. Two long, low, terraced platforms perpendicular to the main pyramid flanked an open plaza of roughly 8 ha in area. The lateral platforms, sometimes referred to as the arms of the U, apparently did not exceed 6 or 7 m in height, but extended some 280 m in length. Extensive daily refuse coeval with the public constructions appears along the perimeter of the monumental architecture. Large-scale horizontal exposures to the southwest of the main pyramid have revealed the postholes of perishable structures and, in one case, the footings of a freestanding building that may have served as a residence. During four short field seasons at Mina Perdida beginning in 1990, we have recovered architectural and other data indicating that the site has a long history spanning much of the second millennium b.c. and that the great size of the main mound is due to dozens of sequential architectural episodes. This pattern of incremental growth is most evident in the sequence of six superimposed central staircases documented for the front of the pyramid. This conclusion is supported by the 17 radiocarbon measurements currently available from the site. These range from 3520 b.p.?100 (Beta-80345) to 2870 b.p.?90 (1-14, 252). Both these radiocarbon dates and the artifacts at the site point to a long Initial Period occupation that was cut short when the site was Figure 2. Plan of Mina Perdida. Map: Bernadino Ojeda and Richard Burger. abandoned at the end of the late Initial Period. Reoccupation of the archaeological complex by later valley farmers was light and short-lived, and it left little impact on most sectors of the site. The discovery of the effigy On August 2, 1994, excavations were being carried out on the back of the main pyramid (Sector IIIA). The excavations were part of an effort to clarify the nature of the pyramid's terracing and to determine whether any other architectural features were present. In this portion of the mound, fragments of the upper terrace walls were visible in some spots, but most of the terracing and the overall layout was obscured by redeposited materials that had eroded downslope from the pyramid's summit.</page><page sequence="7">34 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 3. Mina Perdida's rear staircase with partially cleared adjacent terraces. Photo: Richard Burger. Sections of one of the upper terraces were selected for studies because fragments of a wall running perpendicular to most of the terracing had been encountered, and this suggested the possibility of niches or some other element. Further excavation revealed that the wall running perpendicular to the terracing corresponded to the lateral wall of a massive rear staircase that scaled the terracing, thereby providing Isom?trica Escalera Sur MONT?CULO CENTRAL Figure 4. Isometric drawing of the rear staircase. Drawing: Bernadino Ojeda and Richard Burger. access to the summit from the open land behind the complex (figs. 3-4). Some 20 linear meters of this stairway were exposed from southwest to northeast. This rear staircase resembled the contemporary front staircase at Mina Perdida by being built on top of the terracing, rather than set into it, as was the case at Cardal (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1991). The rear staircase differed from Mina Perdida's main staircase by being much smaller in width and considerably less steep, and by narrowing as it approached the summit. As a consequence of the latter feature, the lateral walls encasing the stairway do not form a straight line as one moves from terrace to terrace. This initially confusing feature led us to study this zone more intensively than originally had been intended. An early stage of this work focused on a 3.3-m-wide terrace adjacent to the staircase, which was sustained by a stone retaining wall (M-73) and backed by another stone terrace wall (M-106). The original height of the back terrace wall (M-106) before its collapse was approximately 210 cm. A talus of unconsolidated soil and debris sloped from the top of M-106 to the top of M-73, completely hiding the terrace. The eroded debris included fragments of adobe, scraps of cord, clay with impressions of wattle and daub, and pacae leaves. After removing this material to a depth of 1 70 cm, we encountered fragments of red pigment unlike that used in normal wall surfacing. Closer inspection revealed that the pigment came from a break in a crust of hardened</page><page sequence="8">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 35 Figure 5. Cleared back stone terrace wall with excavated layers of eroded construction materials and refuse on viewer's left.

Careful removal of a portion of this 20-cm-thick clayey layer exposed the remains of a hand modeled in unbaked clay and painted with red and white pigments (fig. 5). The first hand unearthed was impressive, with each well-preserved Figure 6. The hand of the effigy beneath the layer of clayey soil that sealed it. Photo: Richard Burger. finger measuring some 4 cm in length and a cordage bracelet encircling the wrist (fig. 6). Further excavation revealed that the hand was part of a large anthropomorphic figure, and more work revealed the presence of another hand, the outline of a gourd body, lower limbs, and eventually a head that faced downwards (fig. 7). Only the hair on the back of the figure's head was visible at this point. The body of the figure was wrapped in a white and brown cotton textile; judging from its position, this cloth may have constituted the figure's dress. The layer of clayey soil had completely covered the figure, sealing it and protecting it from subsequent deposits of refuse and collapsed construction materials. Clayey clumps had been deposited around the figure while they were still wet, and impressions of the leaves and other organic materials were left within the clumps and on the clay layer's upper surface. The effigy had been deposited on a thick layer of refuse that covered the floor of the terrace. The figure had been placed face down with its head towards the nearby adjacent terrace and its body perpendicular to the terrace walls. It was oriented NE-SW, in correspondence with the site's axis (fig. 8). Closer examination indicated that the arms, legs, and head of Figure 7. Partially excavated effigy in situ.

Drawing: Richard Burger and Rosemary Volpe. the figure were independent pieces, attached to the gourd body by cordage. As found in situ, the figure had its arms raised on either side of its head and its legs extending from its body; this position and subsequent observations permit the inference that the figure was buried fully articulated. It lies 1.4 m to the east of the wall that defined the western exterior of the staircase (M-105), 42 cm from the back wall of the terrace (M-106). Thus the location of the effigy can be described as the corner of one of the upper terraces adjacent to the rear staircase. As noted, the terrace had been shrouded by a thick layer of eroded construction materials. This covered a layer of refuse, which in turn covered the clayey layer encasing the anthropomorphic effigy (fig 9). The refuse thrown on to the terrace included peanuts, squash rind, l?cuma (L?cuma b?fera) skin, pacae (Inga Feuillei) fruit and leaves, fibers of braided junco (Scirpus sp.), the leaves of pajaro bobo (Cypreus sp.), the stalks and roots of carrizo (Pragmites communis), several types of shell (pique [Crepitpatella sp.], mussels [Choro mytilus], clams [Argopecten purpuratus]), burnt wood fragments, and human coprolites. This mix is typical of the well-preserved refuse on the pyramid's back terraces and it is especially similar to that encountered on the same terrace to the east of the rear staircase. The refuse layer, which both underlies and covers the effigy, differs markedly from the stratum of eroded construction materials above it. The terrace floor above which the figure had been placed showed no special preparation and approximately 30 cm of refuse had already accumulated on the terrace floor before the effigy was deposited. It is likely that the refuse layer derives from feasting activities on the summit since the terrace is adjacent to, but 4 m below, the leveled summit area. The presence of fragments of hammered copper sheet in other terrace refuse deposits strengthens our hypothesis of a summit origin for the garbage, since such fragments of copper sheet were only found in situ on the summit floors. It is easy to understand why the terracing might have been viewed as a convenient place for refuse disposal from the top of the pyramid. The area is far closer to the summit and more convenient than the flatland below. Moreover, the terrace surfaces would not have been visible either from the summit or from the rear staircase itself, nor would they have been evident from the level land behind the central pyramid. Finally, the back terraces do not seem to have been the focus of formal ceremonial activity and thus apparently were not subject to the conventions of sacred cleanliness that characterized many of the summit environments. A similar contrast between ritual cleanliness on the platform and refuse accumulations on the adjacent terracing was encountered at Huaricoto during the late Initial Period (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1985).</page><page sequence="10">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 37 In order to protect the fragile anthropomorphic effigy, we did not attempt to fully uncover it in situ. On the day following the figure's discovery, a protective cocoon was created to facilitate its transport to a laboratory setting where it could be extracted from the clayey matrix and then conserved. The exposed portion of the effigy was initially covered with Japanese rice paper, and then with a layer of river sand; finally a layer of aluminum foil was added to immobilize it. It was then wrapped in surgical bandages and encased with plaster. By the time this process was completed the entire block weighed approximately 35 kilograms. It was transported to the Museo de la Naci?n in Lima where Alison Salazar, under the supervision of Victor Chang, spent the next two years removing the effigy from the block, conserving it, and preparing it for display. Dating The body of the Mina Perdida anthropomorphic effigy is made from a large bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and it was possible to directly date the object by analyzing one of the seeds of the bottle gourd that had remained stuck to its interior. The resulting calibrated AMS radiocarbon measurement was 3030?50 b.p. (Beta 100302). When calibrated, this corresponds to a 2 sigma range (95% probability) of 1405-1120 b.c. This date falls squarely in the late Initial Period. The result of the direct dating of the figure is consistent with other lines of evidence. The stone terrace on which the effigy had been placed was part of a late refurbishment of this portion of the monument; earlier back terraces can be inferred to exist buried behind these masonry retaining walls. Throughout the site, the final centuries of construction are characterized by coarse masonry walls, rather than ones of cubical adobes, and the resultant C14 date is roughly contemporary with these late structures elsewhere on the site. Moreover, excavations indicated that the back terrace in question functioned in conjunction with the rear staircase already mentioned and, by extension, the colonnaded environments on the pyramid's summit. Four radiocarbon measurements were made on samples from a series of superimposed summit floors that had been hypothesized as coeval with the staircase and adjacent back terraces. These yielded the following uncalibrated dates: 3120?130 b.p. (1-17, 973), 3100?100 (1-17, 974), 3020?100 (1-17, 975), and 3000?40 (Beta-80345). As can be seen, these results are Figure 10. Crushed head of the effigy prior to conservation and restoration. 18x13 cm. Photo: Richard Burger. consistent with our inference that the use of the terrace was contemporary with the activities on the summit and they demonstrate that the anthropomorphic effigy was produced while Mina Perdida's summit was in active use. Condition of the effigy At the time of its recovery, the effigy was in generally good condition, but it had been affected by the weight of materials above it. The face had been crushed and, although most of it was intact, it was initially difficult to see its eyes and a portion of the right side of the head was badly damaged (fig. 10). Fortunately, it was possible, using standard restoration techniques, to return the head to its original form and to prevent the surface from flaking. One finger had broken off the left hand, but its original position was self-evident and the separated fragment was restored without difficulty. In some areas, the fragile surface paint required consolidation. Because of the unusually good condition of the figure it is possible to talk about its appearance and coloration with confidence. All descriptions offered here are based on observations made on the unrestored portions of the effigy. Color terms are taken from Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell Color Company 1960).</page><page sequence="11">38 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Description of the effigy The entire object when first assembled would have measured approximately 73 cm (2 feet 4 inches) from top to bottom. The figure is strongly anthropomorphic, although the form of the eyes and fangs suggest the figure's supernatural character. The lower 13 cm of the object was wrapped in cotton cordage to serve as a handle and consequently the anthropomorphic effigy alone measures about 60 cm (2 feet) from the top of its head to the bottom of its feet (figs. 11-12). The striking appearance of the effigy was achieved by modeling and polychrome painting. Black, red, pink, yellow, cream, and white slip paints were applied selectively to the unpigmented brown slip that covered the head, body, and limbs of the figure. The use of pigmented clay slip to show details such as face painting and fingernails makes the effigy particularly vivid in its appearance. The figure was further brought to life by the use of cordage for the effigy's nose ring, bracelets, and anklets. The figure's hair was made of actual hair, and a distinctively light fiber was used for its topknot. Finally, the figure was dressed with a mantle of simple woven textile of white and brown cotton. The effigy is finished on all sides and was designed to be seen from multiple perspectives. The nature of its construction using independent articulating arms and legs would have permitted movement of the effigy and even when static, the position of the figure could have been varied. At the time of its discovery, the figure had its arms held up alongside the head with its palms facing outwards. The legs were flexed and positioned with the feet facing sideways. Because of the unique nature of the effigy, a description of the evidence concerning its manufacture is particularly worthwhile. While the figure would have originally appeared as a single object to the viewer, it actually consisted of six main components: (a) a hollow head, (b) a hollow gourd-body, the lower section of which was modified to serve as a handle, (c) two solid arms, and (d) two solid legs. The head, arms, and legs were independent pieces that were attached to the gourd body by a series of strings that passed through the circular holes that had been cut or drilled in the gourd body. They were presumably secured by knots (invisible to the viewer) in the gourd's interior. Each of the arms was secured with three strings and each leg with two strings; judging from the holes, eight strings secured the connection of the head, which was fitted over the top of the gourd. Not only can cotton cordage still be seen emerging from the arms, legs, and head, but remnants of the string passing through the gourd are still present in some of the holes. Along with the position of the effigy, this constitutes strong evidence that the object was intact at the time of its burial. In addition, the effigy was wrapped in a white and brown cotton textile, which apparently served as a loose mantlelike outer garment. In order to better appreciate the details of the effigy and how it was made, each one of its parts will be described separately. However, first a few words about the colors utilized are in order. As noted, seven colors are present on the figure (see Table 1), most of which were used on its face. According to the Munsell system of color classification, there are two shades of "light red." These are easily distinguished: a darker, stronger red one which was used on the lips, hair ornament, Color Munsell Code Light red 7.5R 6/8 Light red 10R 6/6 Light red 10R 6/8 Pale yellow 5Y 8/4 Yellow 7.5YR 7/6 Very pale brown 10YR 7/3 Black 2.5Y N2/ Light red 10R 6/6 Light red 10R 6/8 Very pale brown 10YR 7/3 White 10YR 8/2 TABLE 1 Portion of Effigy Zone below mouth White part of eyeball Facial striping and hair band Teeth Facial striping Face Eye outline and pupil Front of body (right side) Front of body (left side), legs and arms Back of body, legs and arms Fingernails and toenails</page><page sequence="12">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 39 facial crests, and body and a lighter one which was used in the eyes and beneath the mouth. Similarly, there are two shades of yellow: a strong yellow was used in the face painting and a creamy "light yellow" used on the fangs. A true white was employed for the fingernails and toenails, and black pigment was used to highlight the form and details of the eyes. There is some variability in the shades of each color in different parts of the effigy, and even the coat of red painted on the gourd body shows some variation (10R6/6 to 10R6/8). The body (fig. 11) A large bottle gourd identified as Lagenaria siceraria by paleobotanist Deborah Pearsall (pers. comm., 1997) was used as the body of the effigy. The entire gourd measures 55 cm in length. This gourd is widest at its top where it reaches 11 cm in diameter. Similar gourds are grown today in Casma for use as containers rather than for food, and special care is given to achieve the desired shape (Victor Chang, pers. comm., 1996). Its unusually large, straight, elongated form is probably due to a combination of genetic factors that were selected for and cultivation practices that had been developed to influence the shape of the gourd (Deborah Pearsall, pers. comm., 1997). The gourd tapers naturally to a diameter of 2 cm, at which point its end was removed by transverse cutting. This comparatively narrow lower section fits comfortably in one's hand and can easily be held. This was appreciated by the effigy's creators, and this section of the gourd was converted into a handle for the figure. Except for the final 0.5 cm, the lower 13 cm of the gourd is tightly wrapped with white cotton string. Like the grip on a tennis racket, this wrapping appears to constitute the intentional creation of a handle suitable for holding or positioning the effigy figure. It also serves to visually identify this lower section of the gourd as separate from the supernatural representation. The entire gourd was covered with a very pale brown wash. We interpret this light brown color as representing the natural body color of the figure represented. An additional coat of light red paint was applied to the front half of the gourd-body. We interpret this thin pigmented layer as a representation of the figure's body paint. Significantly, the light red pigment did not extend to the uppermost 4 cm of the gourd, which would have been completely covered by the head. The back half of the body was left with only the very pale brown slip. Figure 11. Bottle-gourd-body of effigy; note cotton handle and holes drilled for connection of arms. 55 x 11 cm. Photo: Richard Burger. As will be seen, the division of the gourd-body into two zones, a light brown "natural" one and a light red painted one, extends to the figure's arms and legs. On the body, as in those parts, the dividing line between the colored and unpigmented zones of the gourd-body is not perfectly straight. The gourd itself is only 5 mm thick and the layers of unpigmented clay slip and red paint are extremely thin, except close to where the head once attached. Near this juncture, the clay thickens and is mixed with some fiber, as if to smooth the linkage between the gourd-body and the modeled head placed on it.</page><page sequence="13">40 RES 33 SPRING 1998 A straight vertical cut was made through the back of the gourd body and almost all its contents were removed. Out of several hundred seeds, only about thirty remained adhering to the insides of the Lagenaria fruit. The hollowing out of the gourd would have facilitated the fastening of legs, arms, and head to the body. The cut begins 11 cm below the top of the gourd and the opening continues for 14 cm. This narrow cleft was subsequently closed by the pressure created by wrapping of the bottom portion of the gourd and then sealed by the application of additional very light brown slip. After the effigy's burial, the gourd-body opened up again under the weight of the overburden. Besides the painting and cutting of the gourd, the most conspicuous modifications are the small holes cut into it for the attachment of the head and limbs (fig. 12). The holes are generally 3 mm in diameter, but in several instances, a hole is enlarged by making a second hole contiguous with it so that the total diameter approaches 8 mm. These minor modifications appear to have been made in response to the difficulty in threading the connecting cordage through the gourd-body. A horizontal line of four holes encircles the gourd 2 cm below its top; a second line of four drilled holes occurs 1 cm below the first row. These holes were created to secure the head. Vertical lines of three holes for attaching the arms appear on the two sides of the gourd within the light brown zone just beyond the red section; on one side of the gourd these begin 7.2 cm below the top, while on the other at 5 cm beneath it. This difference presumably reflects the slightly asymmetrical shape of the natural gourd. A piece of white cotton cordage was recovered from one of these holes. Vertical lines of two holes occur further down on both sides of the gourd still near the edge of the very pale brown zone. These holes were created for attaching the legs and begin 23 cm below the top of one side and 20.5 cm below it on the other. Brown string was found in one of these holes. It is interesting that two holes were utilized to attach the legs while three were employed for the somewhat larger arms. The importance of the head is reflected in the eight holes made for its connection. It should also be noted that in the spots where the arms and legs were attached, the body's brown clay slip is largely missing. We interpret this as being the result of wear from the movement of the articulating arms and legs. If this interpretation is accepted, it implies both that the figure was used before it was buried and that the articulating Figure 13. Closeup of head of the effigy. Photo: Richard Burger. limbs actually did move when the figure was being utilized. Finally, it should be noted that no effort was made to represent primary or secondary sexual characteristics on the body, so there is no indication of the biological sex of the effigy. The head (fig. 13) This component is light and hollow, like the head of a papier-m?ch? puppet. Its 4-mm-thick shell was shaped from what appears to be a mixture of clayey matrix and some type of natural fiber. It is possible that the back of the head has opened up with time; if the two sides of the back of the head were originally joined (rather than hidden by hair), the shape of the face would be narrower than it appears in the photographs published with this article. Unlike the body, both the front and back of the head are slipped only with pale brown clayey wash. This neutral tone is brought to life by painting and modeling in high relief. The naturally modeled anthropomorphic face features a broad nose, a prominent brow, and a weak chin. Special care was given to naturalistically shaping the effigy's flared nose and wrinkled brow. The nose is 4.5 cm wide, and two oval holes were opened to represent nostrils. A plain nose ornament of light colored string is</page><page sequence="14">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 41 ^mt&gt; 11 i^H Figure 14. Head of the effigy in profile; note facial crests. Photo: Richard Burger. looped through the nostrils and tied in front of the septum. This simple fiber nose ring is unprecedented for the Initial Period, but more elaborate nose ornaments of hammered gold were utilized many centuries later by elite members of Chavin society (see Alva 1992:pls. 14-19, 21, 23-25, 27-29, 54-55). There are four deep vertical wrinkles above the nose between the effigy's eyes. This feature is a characteristic known from Initial Period and Early Horizon religious iconography. It has been associated by scholars with felines and expressions of aggression in general (see Roe 1974). In contrast to the naturalistic modeling used to represent the nose and furrowed brow, the ears are not emphasized. Their existence and general shape is suggested by low modeling, but no internal detail is shown. The only well-preserved ear is the proper left one, and it is 4.5 cm long and 1.6 cm wide. The eyes of the effigy are painted rather than modeled, and their hemispherical form is outlined by an uneven black line, which varies from 2-3 mm in width. The same black color is used for the pupils of the eyes. The normally white portion of the eyes is painted pink (technically light red). Hemispherical "eccentric" irises hang from the upper center of each eye; no distinction is made between the iris and the pupil. It may be significant that the right eye is slightly larger than the left eye (the difference is 3 mm in both width and height). This slight asymmetry also applies to the arms and legs; in all cases, the right side is slightly larger than the left. Since all human bodies are slightly asymmetric, these subtle differences may be viewed as additional evidence of a naturalistic representational intention. In later Andean cosmology, differences in the size of eyes or arms were seen as reflecting the larger universal principle of "dual complementarity or dynamic dualism" (Platt 1986, see also Burger and Salazar Burger 1994). The mouth of the figure has a prominent upper lip (9 mm in width), which is shown in high relief. From this upper lip, six large caninelike fangs protrude; they overlap and hide much of the lower lip (which measures 7 mm in width). The teeth hang freely from the upper lip and are connected to the head at the upper extreme. No other teeth are represented. Of the effigy's six fangs, four are complete. These are the same size and measure 2.6 cm in length. They also have the same basic form, with one side curved and the other straight. All of them taper to a point. The fanged mouth of the Mina Perdida effigy is not in any way anomalous given the time of its creation and the place in which it was found. The shape of the fangs and their position in relation to the lower lips resemble other examples of portable and public iconography from the Central Coast that date to the late Initial Period. At first glance, the six massive incisors on the effigy seem extraordinarily prominent; this impression is due to the fact that during this time period most known representations of supernatural visages are in profile. In the Garagay Mound B frieze and many of the ceramic representations, these profile representations feature three enlarged upper incisors; if these faces were represented frontally, they would have six incisors as is the case of the Mina Perdida effigy. A small damaged "plaster" face recovered from a fill at Garagay (Ravines and Isbell 1976:pl. 27) appears to have had a mouth with six large fangs; it offers the closest analogue to the mouth treatment of the Mina Perdida effigy. The area beneath the mouth is painted light red, perhaps to represent blood running down from it. Some of the most interesting features of the face are the two red and white vertical crests that project outwards perpendicular to the facial plane (fig. 14). One of them projects from the center of the forehead, while the other emerges from the center of the chin. The upper crest is</page><page sequence="15">42 RES 33 SPRING 1998 about 25 percent larger than the lower one and it projects 2 cm farther from the face. The upper crest or comb measures 4.2 cm in length with a thickness of only 3 mm. Both crests are white, but they have scalloped edges that are highlighted by a light red band on each. Such crests were rarely, if ever, represented in coeval art styles, and it is a challenge to link them to elements in nature. The most likely source of inspiration for these crests is the very large vulture known as the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus). The adult male condor is characterized by a prominent comb-caruncle extending from the cere to the middle of the crown and a second crestlike wattle or dewlap hanging from the center of its chin (Blake 1977:263; Brown and Amadon 1968:1:190-192). The adult female condor lacks the comblike caruncle. The Andean condor illustrated by Raymond Gilmore in his classic Handbook of South American Indians article has a bicolor crest that resembles the Mina Perdida crests in terms of its location, form, and bicolor banding (Gilmore 1950:390, pi. 46). It may also be significant that the bare skin of an adult male condor is said to be reddish (Blake 1977:263), reminiscent of the body paint applied to the Mina Perdida effigy. Although the huge Andean condors favor highland habitats, they are seen along the coast and the neighboring hills covered with fog vegetation. The condors descend to the Peruvian coast to pray on rookeries, and they return to the highlands to roost and to nest (Brown and Amadon 1968:1:292). Among human populations, perhaps the closest analogue to the "crests" on the effigy are the facial ornaments used in some Amazonian cultures. These are attached to the face either by adhesives or piercing. The lower "crest" on the face of the Mina Perdida figure is positioned in a location often decorated through the use of lip plugs or labrets. Among contemporary peoples of the Amazon and Orinoco, decorative lip plugs of wood or other materials are worn as ornaments through a hole pierced in the lower lip. Lip plugs and labrets have a long history and were widely used in pre-Columbian times, although they have not been documented previously for the Initial Period. Among traditional tropical forest groups, these body ornaments are frequently worn in imitation of birds. Labrets made of feathers are still worn on ceremonial occasions by members of some groups, such as the men of the Urub?-Kaapor tribe who use a labret of macaw and hummingbird feathers during their name giving ceremonies (Roe 1995a:92, fig. 138). The very pale light brown face of the effigy is ornamented with painting in the form of four diagonal bands. These bands vary in width from 1.2-1.4 cm. The two upper bands are light red and they emerge from the top of the forehead "crest" and continue to the area of the ears. The two lower bands are yellow, and they begin at the vertically wrinkled brow between the eyes and run down across the lower cheek. Like the crests, this facial banding appears to have its inspiration in the markings of Andean birds. As Eugenio Yacovleff observed in his 1932 article "Las Falc?nidas en el Arte y en las Creencias de los Antiguos Peruanos," facial banding was commonly shown in the art of many ancient Peruvian cultures. These distinctive markings appear both on naturalistic representations of birds and as facial painting on humans and anthropomorphic supernaturals. Yacovleff convincingly argued that the source of these bands was the natural marking of hawks. Most contemporary scholars have followed him in this assessment (see Rowe 1967:82). Yacovleff's review of contemporary bird populations from Andean South America suggested that the closest parallels for such markings may be the Aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis) and the osprey (Pandion haliaetus carolinensis). The Aplomado falcon is a medium-sized bird of prey that eats birds, lizards, and mammals, while the osprey is a large, fish-eating hawk habitually associated with water. Both birds have prominent facial banding and are common along the Peruvian coast (Blake 1977:272-273, fig. 33), and Yacovleff concluded that both served as models for ancient art, the osprey in the case of the Moche culture and the Aplomado falcon in the case of the Nazca culture (1932:46-48, 62-66). The major difference between the facial banding of the two birds is that the Aplomado falcon has two dark bands, one behind and one beneath the eye, while the osprey has a single broad band extending from behind the eye (Blake 1977:378-379; Brown and Amadon 1968: 2:816, 826). In a detailed drawing of an Aplomado falcon head in profile, Yacovleff illustrates how the two bands of this raptor sometimes appear parallel to each other (1932: fig. 2, upper right). Comparisons with the bands on the effigy from Mina Perdida indicate that the Aplomada falcon is the likely source for the banding. In this case, the colored bands probably represent facial paint applied to evoke the qualities of this graceful, though ferocious, bird. This conclusion is strengthened by a consideration of an incised clay sculpture decorating a pilaster on the</page><page sequence="16">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 43 summit of Mound A at Garagay (fig. 16); this frieze is roughly contemporary with the Mina Peridida effigy. The Garagay sculpture depicts an anthropomorphic face in profile that has two facial bands analogous to those on the Mina Perdida figure. However, attached to the front of the face in place of the nose is a profile rendition of a bird head, complete with recurved raptorial beak and dual eye bands; a distinctive raptor talon abuts the back of this face. It can be argued that these avian appendages unambiguously identify the hawklike attributes of the anthropomorphic supernatural with the facial banding. The two adjacent pilasters that depict anthropomorphic faces without the eye bands also lack the avian beak and talon as appendages (cf. Ravines 1984:37, figs. 20-22). Thus these late-Initial Period Mound A sculptures can be seen as providing independent confirmation of Yacovleff's interpretation of the raptorial source for eye bands. The anthropomorphic effigy from Mina Perdida has a particularly elaborate coiffure. The hair is a medium brown shade, but it is likely that its tone has changed from a naturally darker color since its burial. Laboratory analysis by Dr. H. Wayne Carver, II, Chief Medical Examiner of Connecticut, has demonstrated that actual human hair was used to produce the figure's hairstyle. According to Carver, the hair is round, relatively large, straight, and has a heavily pigmented medulla. Not surprisingly, this type of human hair is indicative of Asian genetic origin as would have been found among indigenous peoples in the Americas prior to European contact (H. Wayne Carver, II, pers. comm., 1998). The hair seems to have been parted in the middle; it is fairly long (8.5 cm) and ends just above the ears. It continues around the back of the effigy's head. A light red hair band binds the top of the hairdo and from it emerges a thick tuft of light brown fiber that is 1.2 cm high and 6.2 cm wide. According to Carver's analysis, this fiber is hair that is relatively fine, tapered, and curly, with banded pigmentation; while such characteristics are not found in human beings, they can be present among rodents (H. Wayne Carver, II, pers. comm., 1998). Additional technical analyses are planned to determine the source of this animal hair. Great effort was expended to produce this distinctive topknot hairstyle judging from the careful attachment of the hair and the tuft to the red hairband. Considering the care with which this hairstyle was fashioned, it is safe to assume that this coiffure must have been an important and meaningful feature of the supernatural figure. The arms These upper limbs, like the lower limbs, are solid rather than hollow. Their fabrication differed significantly from the figure's head, although many of the same materials were utilized. Judging from a cross section visible at the end of the right arm, the form of the arm was shaped around a central core of clayey matrix and fiber; this, in turn, was wrapped with light tan cordage to add volume and strength to the piece. This composite was covered by a clayey admixture that cX &gt;'&lt; I f.:^ !I :S &gt;m Figure 15. Back of anthropomorphic effigy. 73 x 33 cm. Photo: Richard Burger.</page><page sequence="17">44 RES 33 SPRING 1998 was shaped to represent the form of an anthropomorphic arm. Finally, the arm was covered with a thin layer of fine brown slip. The front portions of the arms (and hands) were then painted red, just as described for the body. The fingers were produced in basically the same way, and one damaged finger reveals the otherwise hidden cordage wrapped around a solid core. The backs of the arms and hands were left light brown, but large nails are shown with white paint on all of the fingers (fig. 15). Both wrists of the figure are adorned with cordage bracelets. These ornaments are formed by wrapping the string around the effigy's wrists over a dozen times, and then ending each with a simple knot. The string used in the wrist bands was made by spinning two pieces of unpigmented two-ply cord. The widths of the bracelets are 2 cm on the right arm and 2.2 cm on the left arm. Although wrist ornaments were depicted on Chav?n de Huantar's main cult object, known as the Lanz?n, and on other late-Initial Period sculptures, the materials of the bracelets represented remained unknown (e.g., Burger 1992:figs. 125, 139, 140, 162). Analogous wrist ornaments appear on arachnid supernatural and other figures in the Cupisnique iconography of Peru's north coast during the late-Initial Period and Early Horizon (Burger 1992:fig. 182; Salazar-Burger and Burger 1983). Scholars assumed that some of the Early Horizon bracelets were made of hammered gold, but it has not been suggested in the published literature that such costume elements might have been made of cordage, despite the widespread use of fiber cuffs (or bracelets) by contemporary cultures in the Orinoco and Amazonian drainages (Roe 1995a:96, fig. 153). The Mina Perdida figure strongly suggests this likelihood for some cultures of the Initial Period. This hypothesis is consistent with the Initial Period depiction of a horizontal crease in the well-preserved ankle band on the anthropomorphic "warrior" on the summit frieze of Mound A at Garagay (Burger 1992:65-66, fig. 45). It also has antecedents in the cord bracelets found on two children buried on the central coast at the Middle Preceramic site of Paloma (Quilter 1989:41). As noted, the arms and hands of the Mina Perdida effigy were naturalistically modeled on the human form, and it is this nuanced shaping of the limbs that conveys an impression of depth and naturalism. Some sense of anunderlying skeletal structure is conveyed by the slight projection of the elbow. The presence of musculature is reflected in the enlarged biceps on both arms. In reality both the arms and the hands are unnaturally flat, only 1-1.2 cm in thickness. The right arm is slightly larger than the left, measuring 16.5 cm from tip of the mid finger to the end of the limb. Both arms thicken at their extreme, and strings emerge at this point from the core of the arms to be threaded into the holes in the gourd body. Cords of both brown and white cotton were used for these connecting strings. Perhaps the most impressive features of the upper limbs are the hands. The fingers are disproportionately long (3.8-4 cm), and the white painted nails extend more than halfway down the back of each finger. Unlike the convention in Chavin art, no distinction in length or thickness is made between the five fingers. The hands are spread open, but no details were inscribed on the palms themselves. The fingers are spread widely apart and bent backwards in an unnatural and uncomfortable position. This suggests a specific gesture, possibly of symbolic significance. It is known that hand and body position was used to convey religious meaning during the late Initial Period (Burger 1992:149-150), and it is likely that the pose of the Mina Perdida anthropomorphic effigy is equally meaningful, albeit somewhat more difficult to interpret than that of the Lanz?n. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that the upraised, flexed arms with outspread hands of the Mina Perdida figure are paralleled by some other examples of Formative iconography, such as on one Chavin-Qotopukyo-style bottle from the Ofrendas Gallery at Chavin de Huantar (Burger 1992:139, fig. 134). It is interesting, given the ability to model naturalistically, that no effort was made to represent the joints of the fingers (or toes). This selective realism at Mina Perdida, as elsewhere, probably reflects a thought system in which different parts of the body carry differing ideological significance and weight. The legs The lower limbs were produced in the same manner as the upper limbs. However, they are significantly smaller than the arms. The feet, for example, are only 60 percent the size of the hands. Although also flexed, the position of the legs differs from that of the arms. The feet face sideways rather than frontally, and the flexed position of the legs suggests movement. This impression is reinforced by the naturalistically arched feet. Interestingly, differences between the toes are shown; the two outer toes are roughly a third smaller than the big toe. The treatment of the toes and the rest of the feet</page><page sequence="18">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 45 is distinctively human (H. Wayne Carver, II, pers. comm., 1998) and much more natural than that of the hands. The musculature of the thighs, the bony protuberance at the knees, and the carefully represented heels of the feet all reflect a tradition of realistic modeling that developed during the second millennium b.c. Some of the sculpted clay friezes at Moxeke in Casma and Garagay in Rimac show an equally sophisticated knowledge of human anatomy and the ability to represent anatomy in relief on the public buildings (Burger 1992:figs. 45, 56). In the archaeological literature, these qualities of Initial Period art on the coast have generally received less attention than the more conventionalized styles that decorate most stone sculpture and ceramic vessels, as well as some adobe friezes. Red paint covers the soles of the feet of the Mina Perdida effigy as well as the front of its legs, while the back of the legs and the top of the feet are left light brown. As in the case of the hands, the nails are indicated with white paint. Unfortunately, the nails on the right foot are damaged, but they are clearly visible on the left foot, where each nail extends over nearly the entire length of the toe. The ankles of the legs are decorated with cordage cuffs that are 2.3 cm in width and similar to those already described for the upper limbs. The textile The Mina Perdida figure was discovered wrapped in a rectangular piece of cloth. The textile appeared to be a plain weave (2x1) fabric of two-ply white- and brown colored cotton thread. Technical analysis has not yet been carried out. Judging from its position in archaeological context, the cloth acted as a loosely fitting mantle for the anthropomorphic figure. It would have covered much of the gourd-body, and presumably it would have hidden the joints where the movable arms and legs were fastened to the body. It would have also shielded from view the section of the lower gourd immediately below the figure's legs; this portion of the gourd would have confused the reading of the object. When excavated, the cloth covered most of the gourd body above the wrapped cotton handle. Judging from the woven mantles worn by deceased males and females in the Initial Period tombs at La Galgada (Grieder et al. 1988:80-81), it is likely that the cloth in which the Mina Perdida effigy was wrapped corresponded to a basic garment worn during the Initial Period. Similar textile garments were found on analogous but smaller effigy figures from Garagay (Ravines and Isbell 1976:pls. 28-30). Exploring the meaning of the Mina Perdida effigy The way in which the Mina Perdida figure was utilized and its meaning for the members of the Initial Period society will never be known in any detail or with any certainty. Nevertheless, the foregoing description of the formal features of the anthropomorphic effigy from Mina Perdida provides some clues to understanding its significance and function. The archaeological context in which it was recovered is also germane to a consideration of its role. In addition, as in earlier portions of this article, we employ analogies to the practices and beliefs of traditional cultures in the contemporary tropical forests of the Orinoco and Amazonian watersheds. Such analogies, however imperfect, offer one of the few possible approaches to the otherwise inaccessible realms of meaning and cosmology. The controversial decision to use such analogies reflects our belief that later prehistoric and modern Andean and Amazonian cultures evolved out of and diverged from a shared substratum of beliefs that have been characterized by anthropologists as shamanistic and animistic (see Burger 1992; Lathrap 1985; Roe 1982, 1995b:127-128). While no practice or belief of a contemporary Amazonian (or Andean) group has remained unchanged, their historical connection with these earlier religious traditions justifies considering them in discussions such as this one. As we have noted, the majority of the figure's formal characteristics are human. The shape of the limbs, the number of digits on the hands and feet, the treatment of the nails, the general body proportions, the absence of body hair, the coiffure, and other elements all suggest a strong anthropomorphic component for the figure. However, this pattern should not be interpreted as implying that the effigy represents a mortal man or woman. It should be recalled that many of the supernatural representations of the Chavin and other "formative" art styles are strongly anthropomorphic; the Lanz?n and the Raimondi Stone are well-known examples (Burger 1992:figs. 140, 176). From the accounts of Spanish chroniclers, it is known that in much later times Inca artists frequently represented their deities in human form. For example, in 1575 Cristobal de Molina (1943:39-40) described the</page><page sequence="19">46 RES 33 SPRING 1998 principal cult object at a shrine dedicated to the creator god Wiracocha as "a statue of a man with a white tunic reaching to his feet and hair to his waist." According to the same chronicler, at a critical moment in Inca history the emperor Pachacuti is said to have had a vision of the sun god in which the deity took the form of a luminous man with snakes wrapped around his arms and a puma on his back (Molina 1943:20-21). These accounts by Molina have parallels in many other early Spanish chronicles. The historic descriptions of supernatural representations used in late pre-Hispanic times suggest the danger of assuming a human identity for the Mina Perdida effigy simply because of its anthropomorphic features. On the contrary, such features are consistent with the representation of important supernatural beings in the pre-Hispanic Andes. Moreover, the supernatural character of the Mina Perdida effigy is signaled by several distinctive features, all of which have been identified previously by other investigators (Rowe 1967, Burger 1992). Most conspicuous among these are the six enormous fangs that project from the mouth, almost obscuring the lower lip of the figure. Tello (1923) associated prominent fangs of this kind with the jaguar. John Rowe accepted that mouths with teeth bared and long pointed canines overlapping the lips were probably representations of the mouth of a snarling jaguar, but he went on to suggest a more general interpretation for these "cat mouths." He wrote: Perhaps the most reasonable of several possible alternative explanations is that the cat mouth is used to distinguish divine and mythological beings from ordinary creatures of the world of nature, with the implication of a comparison between the power of the jaguar and supernatural power. Rowe 1967:80 It is worth noting that on the Mina Perdida effigy and, more generally, in the Initial Period iconography of the Central Coast, the fanged mouths represented in religious ?mages usually feature a series of enlarged upper incisors overlapping the lower lip, rather than the interlocking fangs common in Chavin art. The mouths featuring such incisors do not strongly resemble the "cat mouths" of jaguars and other large felines in which the canines are straighter, narrower, and interlocking. Fanged mouths similar to that of the Mina Perdida effigy appear at Chavin de Huantar on sculptures such as the Tello Obelisk, and Donald Lathrap (1973) argued that these mouths were inspired by the black cayman rather than the jaguar. While it is difficult to specify the natural source of inspiration for this artistic convention with certainty, it does seem that, like the halo in Christian iconography, the presence of fangs in the "formative" art styles of Peru symbolized the sacred and awe-inspiring power of the figures represented (Burger 1992:149-150). This conclusion appears to be as true for the Initial Period cultures of the Central Coast as for Chavin culture in the northern highlands. At the late Initial Period center of Garagay in the Rimac Valley, located 38 km north of Mina Perdida, rows of large upper incisors grace the mouths of the arachnid supernatural that were represented on the friezes decorating the atrium walls (Salazar-Burger and Burger 1983; Burger 1992: figs. 43-44). Excavators at the coeval fishing village of Anc?n encountered a shallow bowl decorated with the image of a supernatural with sea turtle attributes; the mouth of the supernatural turtle featured enlarged upper incisors similar to those at Garagay and Mina Perdida (Burger 1992:66). In the Lurin Valley, at the late-Initial Period U-shaped monumental complex of Cardal, the outer walls of the Middle Temple's atrium were decorated with an enormous polychrome mouth band with prominent upper incisors (Burger 1992:52). Significantly, the fanged mouth band at Cardal was used alone to frame the entrance into the built environment in which some of the temple's most important ceremonies were carried out. The variety of contexts on the Central Coast in which a mouth dominated by enlarged upper incisors was used is consistent with a generalized meaning of sacred, awe-inspiring power rather than specific jaguar or other feline associations. This is of special relevance here because such an interpretation points to the supernatural character of the Mina Perdida effigy. However, the features that the Mina Perdida effigy may share with the feline are not limited to the mouth. The distinctively furrowed brow of the figure echoes the wrinkles above the snout of the jaguar or puma when it is provoked. The hemispherical form of the eyes also may be indicative of the figure's supernatural associations. This eye shape does not resemble either that of humans or felines, and it may indicate the nonhuman character of the individual being represented. The eccentric or off center iris near the top of the eye rather than at its center is likewise unnatural. The eccentric pupil may have been chosen as a natural symbol for contact with other realms of experience. Among shamans, claims are</page><page sequence="20">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 47 often made of "seeing" other worlds and thus the need of changing the way one sees. In one account of the process of becoming a Siberian shaman reported by Mircea Eliade (1964:42), we are told: "He changed his eyes; and that is why, when he shamanizes, he does not see with his bodily eyes but with these mystical eyes." Other clues to the significance of the figure from Mina Perdida can be found in its bodily adornment. As already noted, the front of the Mina Perdida figure's body, including its torso, arms, and legs, is painted solid red. This is not surprising considering that the painting of the body and face was practiced in antiquity in much of South America, including the Andes. In more modern times this practice has become largely restricted to the tropical forest. Among theTukana of Colombia, the supernatural to whom animals were subject (Vai-mahse, Master of Animals) was conceptualized as a small man with his body painted red (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:80). The practice of painting the body red or black during rites of passage remained common until recently in both the Orinoco and Amazonian watersheds (cf., Reichel Dolmatoff 1971 :143; Wagley 1977:129). The red color was applied to the body by rubbing a combination of fish oil and red colorant made from the seeds of the urucu or annatto shrub (Bixa orellana) (Turner 1971:103; Wagley 1977:129). A widespread current meaning attributed to the red body paint in the Amazon is a connotation of energy, health, swiftness, and heightened sensitivity, and consequently it is applied to the forearms and hands, lower legs and feet, and face (Turner 1971:103-104). The Mina Perdida effigy's face was decorated with two sets of colored bands, a feature analogous to the facial adornment still employed by many indigenous peoples of the tropical forests of South America. Ethnographers have noted that the geometric forms employed in such decoration by both men and women are frequently inspired by the markings of animals, such as the jaguar or anaconda (Hugh-Jones 1979:201; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:220-222; Turner 1971 ). As already noted, Yacovleff identified facial banding on many pre-Hispanic representations and argued that they stood for "hawk markings." While Yacovleff focused on the cultures of the Early Intermediate Period and later times, the "hawk markings" are also represented during the Peruvian Formative and not limited to Chavin sculpture. Examples of it appear, for example, on an Early Horizon bone spatula from Huaura Valley (Roe 1974:fig. 6), on the north column adorning the portal of Chavin de Huantar's New Temple (Rowe 1967:82), and on the late-Initial Period clay friezes of Garagay's Mound A (fig. 16). ^^ ^S^VHHh^^b^^^^^H^^HhSS^IIV^^hh^^^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^h^^^^^^^^^^^^hH?^^ ^^^^B^^^^HH^^^^^^^HS^^^BI^^^^^^^^^^^S^^^^^HI^^Ih^^H^^^I^SaZ * Figure 16.

Photo: Karen Stothert.</page><page sequence="21">48 RES 33 SPRING 1998 We have argued that the facial bands on the Mina Perdida effigy are based on the natural markings of the Aplomada falcon, while the two painted crests that project from its forehead and chin imitate the caruncle and wattle of the male Andean condor. The incorporation of elements from both birds is particularly intriguing since, as Yacovleff observed, "In the artistic representations, as much as in the chronicles, one essential thing is revealed: for the ancient Peruvian there never existed confusion between the species of the vultures with those of the falcons"(1932:40). Inasmuch as both condor and falcon elements are combined (along with feline and human elements), it is clearly the intention of the effigy's creator to produce a representation that does not correspond to anything in nature. On the contrary, the supernatural figure is intentionally monstrous and replete with multiple symbols and, presumably, polyvalent meanings. The creation of hybrid supernatural is well documented in Chavin religious art, and the Mina Perdida effigy offers one of many antecedents for this practice. Although the condor is a carrion bird, it does take and kill small animals. The Aplomada falcon likewise pounces on small animals, including other birds. In summary, both the hawk and the condor are formidable predatory creatures that eat meat. They also both fly high above the earth, and it is this "soaring" behavior that leads them to be so closely associated with the celestial sphere in South American mythology. How can we understand the meaning underlying these nonhuman feline and avian attributes? If contemporary tropical forest groups are heirs to an ancient Amerindian tradition that once included the peoples of what is now the Peruvian coast and highlands, insight can still be gained by examining the world view that leads these groups to continue to consider these practices as meaningful and to still reproduce them despite radical shifts in the socioeconomic and political reality in which they live. Numerous scholars such as Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975, 1978) and Peter Roe (1982, 1995a) have observed that the Amerindians of lowland South America do not believe that the empirical world is the only demonstrable reality, since altered states achieved through the use of hallucinogenic drugs reveal the existence of other realities behind that normally perceptible in daily experience. A substantial literature exists based on ethnographic observations among dozens of contemporary lowland cultures documenting the belief that humans can enter into these other worlds by zoomorphic transformation and soul journeys via altered states of consciousness. The most common transformations are into jaguars, the alter egos of humans with shamanic powers, and into birds of the upper canopy, whose ability to transcend the earth through flight offers a metaphor for access to the celestial world of the most powerful supernatural forces. It is this general cosmological framework that leads the members of so many cultures of the Orinoco and Amazonian drainages to paint and decorate themselves with emblems of jaguars and birds. In addition, Peter Roe observes that for people holding this shamanistic world view, joints become analogized as portals into the body and consequently must be defended by encircling body ornaments or ligatures (Roe 1995a:84-86). If this perspective is applicable to the Mina Perdida figure, the significance of the cordage bracelets and anklets, like the facepaint and facial crests, can be understood in terms of the shamanistic world view that underlies much of pre-Columbian thought, as well as a representation of actual body adornment. The special cosmological significance of joints has likewise been emphasized by Urton (1996) in his analysis of Chavin art. A fascination with the role of entry points into the human body also suggests why the nonhuman elements are most prominent at the two principal "portals of entry" into the body of the Mina Perdida effigy: its eyes and its mouth. Even the nostrils of the effigy are encircled by a fiber nosering. Finally, the special significance of joints might be relevant to explaining the creation of a jointed effigy for religious purposes. One other feature worth noting in regard to the special identity of the figure is the treatment of its hair. As described above, the figure's hair is gathered at the top of its head by a red hair band, and lighter brown hair rises from this hair ornament almost like a topknot. Interestingly, the tenon heads at Chavin de Huantar also feature supernaturals with an unusual hair arrangement resembling a sort of topknot, and this coiffure is shared by the sculptured figures both in their human form and in their transformed jaguar state (Burger 1992:157-159). In the case of Chavin, these topknotted figures have been interpreted as possible mythical prototypes for the temple's religious authorities. Considerable effort was</page><page sequence="22">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 49 used to produce the distinctive hairstyle of the Mina Perdida effigy, and its similarity to hairstyles represented in Chavin religious sculpture reinforces the likelihood that it helped to signal the special identity or status of the effigy. In summary, despite the prominent anthropomorphic characteristics of the Mina Perdida figure, it is likely that it represents a supernatural personage. The jaguar and avian elements suggest the figure's involvement in shamanic transformation, and it is possible that the Mina Perdida effigy represents a mythical ancestor who now occupies the celestial world. If analogy with Chavin iconography holds, the distinctive topknot hair arrangement may signal someone who can transform into feline and avian forms to contact the supernatural realm. The dominance of anthropomorphic features on the effigy, in contrast to the supernatural images on the friezes at Garagay and Cardal, are consistent with such an interpretation. If a mythical ancestor is being represented by the figure, the flexed position of its arms and legs suggests that the ancestor remained an active, dynamic force symbolically leaping from the celestial world into the reality of this world. In attempting to wrestle with the difficult, but fundamental issue of meaning, it is worth contemplating the use of the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) for the figure's body. While there are obvious practical advantages that might justify the use of the bottle gourd for the body of the effigy, there existed numerous alternatives. Certainly, the symbolic values associated with this cultigen should be considered as potentially relevant to the effigy's significance, particularly given the continued importance of the bottle gourd in contemporary Amazonian ritual (for example, Hugh-Jones 1979:163-192). As Donald Lathrap (1977) emphasized in his article "Our Father the Cayman, Our Mother the Gourd," the hard-shelled fruit of the white-flowered bottle gourd had special significance as the earliest cultigen known in the Andes. Whether any memory of the bottle gourd's primordial role in plant domestication remained by the Initial Period is unknown, although its prominent representation on the Tello Obelisk suggests that some sense of its importance had survived in myth (Lathrap 1973). As Lathrap notes, in South American lowland myth and ritual, the bottle gourd is viewed as a metaphorical womb. In one myth from Guyana, for example, the only surviving man peoples his region by copulating with a gourd (Lathrap 1977). The symbol of the gourd as womb is shared with cultures of Melanesia and Africa. But while the bottle gourd generally has strong association with the female forces of fertility, the distinctive form of the bottle-shaped race of Lagenaria siceraria, such as in the one used for the body of the Mina Perdida figure, is suggestive of the male copulatory organ, the penis. In fact, traditional peoples of New Guinea and other areas used this race of Lagenaria siceraria as penis sheaths. This raises the possibility that the Lagenaria siceraria could have served as a powerful natural symbol for the fusion of the female and male forces of fertility. Such a reading of the gourd would be consistent with the lack of diagnostic sexual attributes on the Mina Perdida effigy. This absence contrasts with the strong female character of coeval ceramic figurines from Initial Period sites along the Central Coast (Burger 1992:65-66, fig. 48). If the effigy did represent a mythical ancestor, the choice of the gourd for the body because of its salience as a symbolic womb/penis would seem to be particularly appropriate. Additional insight into the meaning of the Mina Perdida effigy can be gleaned from a consideration of the context in which it was found. As has already been described, the figure was buried face down on a back terrace of the pyramid; the figure was oriented parallel to the site's central axis (and was as close to this axis as possible without being on the back staircase itself). Is there any intelligible significance to this manner of disposal? In considering this question, we were struck by its potential parallels to the burial of male and female ancestors in the Middle Atrium at nearby Cardal (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1991). The bodies of these individuals were generally interred face down and then covered with rock and clayey matrix. The place of their burial was determined by the central axis of the site. Finally, the location of the bodies' disposal was only obscured by the deposition of later unrelated material. While these parallels to the disposition of the Mina Perdida effigy are far from conclusive, it is tempting to ask whether the disposal of the Mina Perdida effigy on the terrace bears some relation to the burial of ancestors in the heart of the Cardal pyramid. If so, this would strengthen the interpretation of the Mina Perdida effigy as a mythical ancestor.</page><page sequence="23">50 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Exploring the function of the Mina Perdida effigy Determination of the function of the Mina Perdida effigy is particularly difficult because it appears to be a unique example of an otherwise unknown class of objects. This statement does not imply that there are no analogues to it, but it does reflect our opinion that none of the comparable objects served the same function as the anthropomorphic figure from Mina Perdida. In terms of iconography and manufacture, the closest analogy to the Mina Perdida effigy is found with two "mu?ecos" (dolls) and a related object recovered in the excavations by Rogger Ravines and William Isbell at the Initial Period U-shaped center of Garagay. While these have not been published in detail, enough information is available to make preliminary comparisons. The "doll" recovered from Offering Pit B on Mound B (Ravines and Isbell 1976:1am. 28) has numerous anthropomorphic features, including naturalistic oversized hands (with nails) that are reminiscent of the Mina Perdida effigy. Like the Mina Perdida effigy, it is dressed in a plain weave textile. The supernatural identity of the Garagay mu?eco is signaled by its fangs and by its somewhat hemispherical eyes with eccentric pupils. Besides the similarity of their formal characteristics, its construction seems to be similar to that of the Mina Perdida effigy. A second "doll," recovered from Offering Pit C on Mound B (Ravines and Isbell 1976:1am. 30), likewise represents an anthropomorphic figure dressed in a plain weave textile, but with a fanged mouth. In this case, there are both enlarged upper and lower incisors. As in the case of the Mina Perdida effigy, the nose is carefully modeled and some sort of hair or other fiber is used in the figure's coiffure. A third fragmentary modeled face (referred to as a "mascarilla de yeso") recovered in a fill from Mound A at Garagay may have originally been part of still another mu?eco. The surviving piece shows an anthropomorphic face with six prominent upper incisors, hemispherical eyes with eccentric pupils, and a painted face band descending from the eyes across the figure's cheek. The two complete figures are described as being painted and made of modeled plaster built around a core of small twigs, fiber, and leaves. The excavators were impressed with the quality of the modeling of the hands and face. While these figures from Garagay provide an interesting source of comparison to the Mina Perdida effigy, they do little to advance our understanding of its meaning. The Garagay specimens are significantly smaller. The Mina Perdida effigy, for example, is seven times the size of the figure found in Offering Pit B at Garagay. It also is significant that none of the Garagay figures have gourd-bodies. In addition, there is no indication that the Garagay figures were built to permit the movement of their limbs, as was the case with the Mina Perdida piece, and they lack handles for holding them. Thus, despite the similarities in features and manufacture, the figures may have been used very differently from the Mina Perdida effigy. In scale and general form, the Garagay "dolls" are in some respects closer to ceramic figurines than to the Mina Perdida effigy. While the Mina Perdida and Garagay specimens were all recovered from temple mounds, the two Garagay pieces came from so-called Offering Pits (which may have been socket supports for columns) buried under the fill of later construction, and the face fragment likewise came from construction fill. These contexts and the way in which the specimens were discarded are quite distinct from the context in which the Mina Perdida effigy was found. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the Garagay specimens, like the Mina Perdida effigy, were once considered ritual paraphernalia and that their burial in the ceremonial architecture solved the problem of disposing of these symbolic items. Another object that is comparable in some respects to the Mina Perdida effigy is a wooden figurine discovered by Ramiro Matos (1968:227-228) in the late-Initial Period grave of an adult woman at the fishing village of Anc?n. The anthropomorphic figurine in question is carved of the nonlocal tropical wood known as chonta. The face of the figurine is painted red and black. As in the Mina Perdida effigy, the facial features, fingers, and toes (including nails) are carefully executed. The figurine, however, not only differs in the material and the manner in which it was made, but it also lacks the feline and avian attributes so prominent on the Mina Perdida figure. One powerful parallel is that the arms were carved separately from the body, but unlike the Mina Perdida object, the head, body, and legs were all made from a single block of wood and the object has no handle. Although the arms are jointed, they hang sideways on the body, and the fingers are not spread apart. Similarly the legs are not flexed or turned sideways. Thus there is no feature of the figurine that suggests that it represents a supernatural. Its size (12.3 cm in height) and its funerary context likewise suggest no functional (or ideological) analogue to the Mina Perdida figurine.</page><page sequence="24">Burger and Salazar-Burger: A sacred effigy from Mina Perdida 51 Lacking any close comparisons, our hypotheses concerning function must derive from formal observations of the Mina Perdida anthropomorphic effigy. The handle at the base of the object suggests that it was meant to be held, perhaps above the head of its handler. As in the case of the shadow puppets of Java and Bali, the handle suggests that the effigy was actively manipulated rather than passively positioned. The jointed arrangement of the figure's arms and legs is clearly designed to permit movement and, as noted, the wear confirms that the figure's limbs did move during its use prior to interment. Connected to the gourd-body only by cotton strings, the arms and legs of the figure would have unavoidably swung back and forth as it was carried. The finishing of the limbs and the body strengthen the impression that the effigy was designed to be seen from many angles while in active use. Considering our interpretation of the meaning of its iconography, we would suggest that the effigy was a puppetlike piece of religious paraphernalia utilized in the rituals carried out in the summit environments of Mina Perdida. Perhaps the ultimate function of the effigy was as a tool in the ancient narratives or religious dogma. Analogies to the puppets of Southeast Asia suggest the powerful role of theatre in communicating myths, beliefs, and values, whether in a sacred setting or a more secular one. Southeast Asia is one portion of the world where puppetlike effigies still play a central role in spiritual and cultural life. Whether dealing with relatively simple puppets consisting of modeled heads and arms attached to a long stick that are used by men's societies in Vanuatu (New Hebrides) or with the elaborately painted, flat, leather puppets used in the Balinese and Javanese shadow theatre (wayang), the power of these pieces of ritual paraphernalia when animated by their holder is undeniable. The scale of the Mina Perdida effigy is appropriate for use in the small, closed environments found on the summit of Mina Perdida and analogous U-shaped centers. Within atria the size of those at Cardal and Garagay, it would have been possible to appreciate the detailed polychrome features and subtle movement of this remarkable effigy. It will be recalled that the figure was found on an upper terrace of the Mina Perdida central pyramid, just below the areas where such environments existed. And while the use of the effigy on the pyramid's summit could not have been appreciated by people in the plaza below, the "puppet" could have been carried through the open plaza area, just as small effigies of Catholic saints are paraded through the streets and squares of Peruvian towns and cities today. As noted at the outset of this article, the nature of the rituals carried out in the ceremonial complexes of the Initial Period remain largely unknown, but the likelihood that they sometimes involved the use of large puppetlike figures suggests the visual and choreographic richness that may have been involved. By the time the Spanish arrived, ceremonies no longer employed jointed effigies like that found at Mina Perdida, but costumed and masked dancers may have served much the same function. On the other side of the Pacific, the voices of gods and ancestors today continue to speak through the puppetlike effigies of Southeast Asian cultures from Thailand to Melanesia (Guidieri and Pellizzi 1981), as the tales of their people are reenacted for yet another generation. And once such performances have been witnessed, perhaps it is not impossible to imagine a torchlit ceremony on the top of Mina Perdida, with winds blowing off the ocean, and stars carpeting the sky. Suddenly a terrifyingly strange yet almost human supernatural cloaked in a cotton garment leaps into view, its limbs swaying and hair blowing. Enormous fangs jut from its mouth, its huge hands are raised and spread wide, and a strange disembodied voice issues from its fanged and bloody mouth telling of an unseen world and a mythical time, both of which suddenly seem very real indeed.
