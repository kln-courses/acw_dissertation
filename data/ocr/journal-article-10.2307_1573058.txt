Printed in Great Britain A DISCUSSION OF MY ART OBJECTS: 'ACTION WORKS' Stathis Logothetis* Abstract-After discussing briefly his outlook on art and the character of his painting done before 1963, the author describes his transition to making three-dimensional painted objects he calls 'action-works'. He distinguishes four phases in his work during the decade 1963 to 1973. The first phase is represented by works that result from tearing, crushing or otherwise violently treating materials and constructing objects from them. In this phase he saw himself in conflict with the materials. In the second phase he combined contrasting materials together, to give the impression that the materials are in conflict with each other. His third phase involves transformables are intended to be acted upon by viewers, that is, they can be taken to be in conflict with them. Finally, in the fourth phase, he prepared works in which flexible materials assumed shapes under various influences, such as gravity, shrinkage and swelling, to give a viewer the feeling that they were attempting to escape from their constraints. I. I agree with those who believe that art is a biological necessity. More explicitly, I consider that art is the means for numerous individuals to express their reactions to the world about them and a manifesta- tion of what I call their primeval will. To this end, in the plastic arts, they direct their thought pro- cesses to formulate content, form and colour through the act of making art objects. The chain process they follow is: 'I will-I think- act'. I like to think of canvas and paint as the recipients of my artistic act. These materials end up as an object with a 'moral presence', a permanent testimony of an aspect of my personality. My works of the decade 1963-1973 relate to the above outlook on art. In fact, this outlook was the result of my analysis of these works. But before discussing these works in more detail, I feel it appropriate to describe briefly the evolution of my painting before 1963, which can be divided into a first, 1954-1956, and a second, 1957-1962, period. fn the first period, the geometric structure of a composition dominates, while distinctive themes express an anthropomorphic content. For example, one painting of this period shows a human figure oppressed by the weight of a peculiar perspective of its surroundings, which, incidently, is charac- terized by a spirit of oppression that repeatedly appears in my work. A series of continuous line drawings that started with a human theme or a landscape led to the non-figurative compositions of geometric style with * Artist living at 48 Erechtheiou St., Athens 402, Greece. (Received 27 August 1973.) a lyrical feeling of the second period, which cul- minated with the disruption of this geometric style. The disruption permitted me to use colour more freely; the colours I chose became highly con- trasting and assumed primary importance in a composition. The compositions acquired a clear and concrete organization of shapes that seemed to attract or repel each other, to become com- pressed, crushed. Colours, in order to emphasize these aspects, were limited to a little white and a larger amount of black and red, with compositions finally executed only in hues of violent red. These last compositions prepared the climate of conflict, oppression and anxiety that I introduced into my art objects of 1963-1973. I say here 'the climate' and not 'the method' or 'the technique', because, since the beginning of 1963, f have done something different from what [ had done before. I no longer make traditional paintings but 'construct' three- dimensional objects, which I call 'action works', from various materials that are then painted. I consider materials that I use (always the cheapest and handiest ones, like cotton cloth, sacking, old petrol cans, string, wire, nails, oil paint, etc.) as recipients of my artistic act upon them. I cut, tear and crumple them and I remould, shape and paint them. I transform them into a final object that I judge presents the results of these actions satisfactorily. The difference between my work and that of others, such as Alberto Burri [1], who also use sacking, string and paint, is that their works are compositions or constructions that have been deliberately worked out, whereas my pre- occupation is with the performance of more or less violent acts upon materials, which I then paint. 297 __</page><page sequence="2">Stathis Logothetis Throughout this 10-year period I used variations only of the colour red, ranging from a hue border- ing on orange to a very deep red and from a red high in saturation to one approaching black. This is not because of my predilection for the colour red but because I feel that red produces an effect that is consistent with the content of these works. 1 distinguish four phases in my work during this 10-year period and they follow one another without a clear demarcation in time. There may be a return to a previous phase and sometimes a merging of approaches from several phases in the same work. In spite of this, the differentiation of the content of each phase is, I feel, clear. II. In February 1963 I was standing before a canvas when suddenly I took a knife and slashed it vertically. It was an act of violence. The beginning of a negation, a protest, a conflict. Immediately afterwards, I took a sacking needle and string and tried to mend the slashed canvas; I tried to repair what I had just damaged. In this way began a process of damage and repair, of action and reaction. Its essence cannot only be projected to many human activities but may find parallels even in the processes of nature. In the works that followed thereafter, my 'acts' varied: (a) I set fire to a piece of sacking stretched on a frame and then I sewed the edges of the burnt hole or stuffed it with a rag. (b) I smashed with an axe a frame on which a piece of cotton cloth was stretched and then mended the materials to produce the object shown in Fig. 1. (c) I crumpled and cut apart an old petrol can and then I tied the pieces together with wire, or alternatively, I nailed the pieces onto a burnt frame. (d) I crushed and tore pieces of paper and then 1 glued them back together. All these 'acts' have one pattern in common: my conflict with the materials, damage to them and my effort to repair the damage. When one of these works nears its final stage, I paint it over with hue and value gradations of red that I find will stress correctly and persuasively its intended impact on viewers. A sewn slash on a canvas is not merely a sewn cut painted red, it represents to me a wound, an ache, a testimony of the sensations of violence and of resistance. This is the spirit of the first phase of this 10-year period. My attention has been drawn by Leonardo to a similar spirit and approach in the early works of Ichikawa [2]. III. The thought of an art object made from texturally contrasting materials such as sacking and tin or sacking and cloth led to the idea of the second phase that, instead of continuing to make objects that I regard as testimonies of a conflict between me and the materials, I should make objects having Fig. 2.

Some works of this phase are the following: (a) A piece of cloth stretched across a frame but occupying only three-quarters of its area, contrasts with a smaller piece of sacking crudely sewn on it with a piece of string or attached by means of safety pins. (b) An old petrol can, held tightly against a backboard by a piece of sacking, is intended to give the impression that it is attempting to free itself. It pierces the sacking, exposing its sharp corners. (c) Pieces of sacking nailed to two opposing sides of a large frame stretch inwardly toward wrinkled, cut-apart pieces of a petrol can to which they are attached by bits of rusty wire (Fig. 2). In these objects variations of the colour red again underline the contrast between the materials. At their points of contact it conveys the impression of blood. On the sacking, the colouring varies from blood red to dark red and finally to black. The petrol can parts, covered with partially burnt linseed oil and with paint varying in colour from red to black, can be taken to have the appear- ance of a battered metallic organism. Prior to painting, the sacking was coated with a wet mixture of starch and sand and permitted to dry. This treatment gave the surface a rougher texture, in strong contrast to the texture of ordinary cotton cloth. The sacking, covered by consecutive layers of paint, progressing in colour gradually from yellow to ochre and finally to red, has the sheen of Fig. 3.

A group of figurative works that I call torsi began to emerge as a separate entity during the first phase. They are the only works that I have made that are abstractions of the human body and it was no mere coincidence. Either because I was led to this by the texture of human skin taken on by cloth painted as described above or because I subconsciously turned to acts of violence or, since my personal attitude to art and life is anthropocentric, sacking and metal sheet from old petrol cans took on, in my hands, the shape of parts of a human body. Here is how I proceeded in making the work shown in Fig. 3. I glued an ordinary light insulating polyester panel, one-inch thick, on to a thick piece of cardboard. This constituted the support, re- placing canvas stretched on a frame. By making cuts and by creasing the support, I made a relief that resembled the surface of a human torso. I then covered this support with sacking. I stuffed paper under certain areas of the sacking to accentuate the relief. 1 tore the sacking, made holes in it and then sewed them, as can be seen in Fig. 3. By painting Fig. 4.

The object in Fig. 3 was made following the procedure I used during the first phase of this 10-year period (direct action on materials). But I also constructed torsi using the procedure of the second phase (using highly contrasting materials). Two were made as follows: (a) A crumpled petrol can served as the support and as the innards of a torso. Its sharp corners tear the sacking that is tightly wrapped around it to suggest skin. The innards protrude here and there as though they are trying to escape. The paint, varying from red to black, strengthens the impression of a tortured body. (b) Around a vertical pipe I fixed a few tin sheets, which together give the shape of a human torso and legs. I wrapped this shape tightly in cloth, which I joined by stitching along the spinal column. In this way a statue of a woman (no longer in relief) resulted. The sharp edges and creases of the tin within the figure press clearly against the stretched cloth and, at three spots (the pubis and the tips of the breasts), three small sharp tin corners protrude through slight tears in the cloth. The entire surface of the statue, painted red, yellow and ochre, conveys the impression of smooth, moist and bleeding skin. This is the only statue that I have made. I construct masks as well. In the example shown in Fig. 4, 1 prepared a plastic mass from frayed threads of sacking saturated with a starch solution. I shaped this mass initially with violent movements and then progressively, with more sensitive strokes, until I gave it the shape, in relief, of a human head. The rear side is flat so that it can be hung against a wall. When this mass dried, it became very hard. I stressed its tragic character by painting it red and ochre. But this work belongs also to the first phase of this period, since it takes shape through im- pulsive acts on material. Anyhow, it was the act of shaping that interested me, not the final concrete object. V. A new aspect, transformability, was introduced in the third phase of this last period and with it another one-an invitation to viewers to alter the appearance of the object presented to them. The basic ideas of the previous two phases are per- petuated in these objects. The difference is that whereas previously only I acted upon the materials I had chosen, now I provide viewers with materials that they can act upon. Here are two examples: (a) I offer viewers a rag soiled from cleaning paint- brushes or an ordinary piece of cloth painted with red colours and having cuts, frayed edges and holes. Fig. 5.

The results produced may provide interesting psychological insights into their personalities. (b) I nail to a square or circular frame a piece of red-painted cloth dampened with a dilute starch solution (Fig. 5). The cloth is much larger than the area of the frame, so that it protrudes to give a wrinkled surface. Viewers are free to reshape the surface into shapes they desire. The cloth is starched so that it will maintain a shape given to it. VI. I also became interested in the shapes flexible materials take when acted on by forces such as gravity, shrinking and swelling. In this case neither I nor the viewers act upon the materials. They transform from one shape to another, trying to escape from a frame, pouring on to a floor, shrinking and squeezing and swelling upwards toward the ceiling. The significance of each of these works is that they are meant to give a viewer the impression that the materials are in conflict either with themselves or with their supports, that they are transformed and that they are even expanding in their environment. The example shown in Fig. 6 was made by fastening starched cotton to a rectangular frame in such a way that it swells loosely at the top portion and is stretched tightly at the bottom portion. The resulting bulging shape of the material can be interpreted to signify that the material is trying to get off the frame. A variant of this kind of work consists of a vertical frame (80 x 32 in.) to which, at the top, cloth is pulled taut and attached, is allowed to swell in the lower portion and, finally, is let fall free of the frame on to the floor. The hues vary from red to orange at the stretched portion Fig. 7. 'E. 165', cotton, wooden frames, acrylic paint, 100 x 200 cm., 1972. and the folds below gradually darken to become black on the portion on the floor. In Fig. 7 is shown a piece of cotton cloth that has been allowed to hang loosely between two supports of different shape. The shape of the folds gives me the impression that the material is flowing to the right or trying to escape from the larger support. Furthermore, the shapes of the cotton cloth vary from a large rectangular to a smaller square one at the ends with one in between having gently curving folds. These last examples are typical of the objects I have made during the fourth phase of the 10-year period. For the first two kinds of objects I have described I regard myself as a protagonist of materials, for the third I allow viewers to impose on flexible materials shapes of their own choice and for the fourth I allow a flexible material to take on shapes freely under the action of gravity or of other forces, such as those caused by shrinking and swelling, within constraints I provide. I have also made works that combine features of the four phases I have described above, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 (cf. colour plate). In these works the basic attitudes I have toward my art, which I have described at the beginning of the article, remain the same [3]. With my will and my intelligence I merely try, as an artist, to unravel, to unveil, to understand and to present visually aspects of my reactions to life and to art. REFERENCES 1. A.
