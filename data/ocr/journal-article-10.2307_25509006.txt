<plain_text><page sequence="1">105 The Heart of the Matter: Models for Irish High Crosses Dorothy Kelly, Member An examination of evidence presented by some Irish high crosses and related crosses in western Scotland indicates their dependence on wooden prototypes. Four groups of crosses are analysed and two major approaches to the construction of putative wooden prototypes are identified. The time of the emergence of the prototype wooden forms is suggested, with an assessment of the evidence which indicates the likely period of translation into stone. The existence of free-standing crosses of wood in Ireland and Britain during the early Christian period is known primarily from evidence offered by the written sources, in particular in the Lives of saints and in contemporary histories (Collingwood 1927, 5; Thomas 1971, 123; Edwards 1985, 398-99; Hamlin 1987, 138). Two often quoted references, from Adomn?n's Life of Colmcille and Bede's Ecclesiastical History, are of particular importance in that they document free-standing wooden crosses probably as early as the first half of the seventh century, well before the advent of any known stone crosses. Adomndn, abbot of the Columban foundation at Iona from 679 to 704 (Kenney 1929, 284), mentions three crosses erected at Iona which still stood during his lifetime. One, fixed in a mill-stone, was erected at a place where Colmcille rested shortly before his death: In quo loco postea crux molari infixa lapidi hodieque stans in margine cernitur viae. [In that place a cross that was later fixed in a mill-stone is seen, standing by the roadside, even today.] (Anderson and Anderson 1961, 522-23) Although the material of the cross is not recorded by Adomn&amp;n it is generally accepted that it probably was wood (Collingwood 1927, 5; Thomas 1971,123: Edwards 1985, 399). While the cross still stood at the time when Adomn?n was writing, c. 688-92 (Anderson and Anderson 1961,96), his words suggest that it had by then been in existence for some time; it might well have been erected close to the time of Colmcille's death in 597. The other crosses mentioned by Adomn&amp;n, erected to mark the spot where Ern?n, Colmcille's uncle, died, and the place where Colmcille stood on that occasion (Anderson and Anderson 1961, 306-7), seem likely also to have been of wood and might have been erected during Colmcille's lifetime or shortly afterwards. The notion of marking with crosses places associated with events in Colmcille's life may have been a familiar one to Adomn&amp;n. He himself provides evidence that it could have been related to a wider tradition within Department of Archaeology, University College, Dublin 4. JRSAI Vol 121 (1991): 105-145</page><page sequence="2">106 DOROTHY KELLY the Christian world at the time, recording in De Locis Sanctis Arculf s description of a 'tall wooden cross' [lignea crux summa] (Meehan 1983, 86-87) placed at the spot in the river Jordan where Christ had been baptized. In an insular context Eddius, writing probably shortly before 720 (Colgrave 1927, x), recorded that a wooden cross was erected at Oundle to mark the place where water used to wash Wilfrid's body was poured away: 'The people who inhabited the monastery afterwards built a wooden cross on the spot, and the Lord used to perform many marvels there' ['et habitatores cellae ligneam crucem ibidem postea erexerunt, ibique Dominus multa mirabilia facere consuevit.'] (Colgrave 1927, 142-3). The Venerable Bede (HE III.2) recorded the raising of a cross by Oswald, afterwards king of Northumbria, at Heavenfield in 633: Ostenditur autem usque hodie et in magna ueneratione habetur locus Me, ubi uenturus ad hancpugnam Osuald signum sanctae crucis erexit, acflexis genibus Deum deprecatus est, ut in tanta rerum necessitate suis cultoribus caelesti succurreret auxilio. Denique fertur quia facta citato opere cruce, ac fouea praeparata in qua statui deberet, ipse fide feruens hanc arripuerit ac foueae inpostuerit atque utraque manu erectam tenuerit, donee adgesto a militibus puluere terrae figeretur. [The place is still shown today and is held in great veneration where Oswald, when he was about to engage in battle, set up the sign of the holy cross and, on bended knees, prayed God to send heavenly aid to His worshippers in their dire need. In fact it is related that when a cross had been hastily made and the hole dug in which it was to stand, he seized the cross himself in the ardour of his faith, placed it in the hole, and held it upright with both hands until the soldiers had heaped up the earth and fixed it in position.] That this cross was of wood we know from Bede's subsequent statement: Nam et usque hodie multi de ipso ligno sacrosanctae crucis astulas excidere solent, quas cum in aquas miserint, eisque languentes homines aut pecudes potauerint siue asperserint, mox sanitati restituuntur. [And even to this day many people are in the habit of cutting splinters from the wood of this holy cross and putting them in water which they then give to sick men or beasts to drink or else they sprinkle them with it; and they are quickly restored to health.] As Edwards has observed (1985,399) it is possible that Oswald's act of erecting a wooden cross was influenced by practices observed at Iona, Oswald having spent spent some time in exile amongst the Dalriadic Scots, where he was baptised (HE III.3). The written sources, sparse as they are, allow us to suggest, therefore, that high crosses of stone were preceded, by some significant time, by free-standing wooden crosses. These apparently survived to a great age, up to one hundred years on the evidence of Bede, who indicates that the cross erected at Heavenfield in 633 was still extant when he was writing his Ecclesiastical History, a work finished in 731 (Colgrave and Mynors 1969, xxii), and were possibly part of a much more widespread tradition than can now be recognised from these sources alone; one might ask, for example, how much of Bede's apparent lack of interest in the appearance of the cross at Heavenfield may have been due to familiarity with such monuments? The excerpts presented here encapsulate some of the typical shortcomings of the evidence to be gleaned from the written sources: the information is</page><page sequence="3">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 107 sparse, is provided incidentally, and often requires speculative interpretation; Adomnan does not mention the material of the crosses at Iona and Bede did not set out to enlighten his readers directly on the material of the cross at Heavenfield, we know this only because of his allusion to the later practice of taking relics of the cross. As Hamlin has observed (1987, 138), references to crosses in written sources rarely specify either the material of which they were made or whether they were free-standing. Much less do the written sources give any indication of the form of the cross. For this we rely almost entirely on the evidence of archaeology. Archaeology again provides us with some limited evidence, direct and indirect, of the probable existence of wooden crosses at this period. Indirect evidence comes from the interpretation of representations of crosses similar in form to the high crosses on cross-slabs which apparently date from the early eighth century, before the advent of the monumental stone crosses. 6 Riordain argued (1947, 111-12) that the depictions of these ringed crosses, some with pointed stake-like butts, is strongly suggestive of the existence of wooden crosses of similar form to the stone high crosses. Direct evidence for the probable existence of wooden crosses comes in the form of a wooden boss recovered from tenth century levels (Wallace 1984,123) of the excavations at Wood Quay in Dublin. The hemispherical boss, originally some 26cm in diameter and 11.2cm in depth, is carved with interlace ornament (Wallace 1984, PI. p. 118; Lang 1988, Fig. 1, PL 1). The suggestion that the boss could have come from a high cross is compelling. It is, as has been pointed out (Wallace 1984, 123; Lang 1988, 4), similar in size and shape to bosses on some high crosses, most closely comparable to bosses placed at the centre of the heads of crosses at Tynan, county Armagh, and Clogher, county Tyrone, which are similar in size and also have interlace ornament. That the cross from which this boss might have come may have been considerably older that the tenth century is suggested by its curious presence in the context of the settlement at Wood Quay; as Lang suggests it seems likely that it was introduced from a context outside the city, although it might perhaps be more convincingly regarded as a relic rather than a 'souvenir' (Lang 1988, 4). The evidence of a probably widespread early tradition of erecting wooden crosses, examples of which survived for considerable periods of time, allows the probability that when it came to the point of creating crosses in stone their sculptors were surrounded by great riches in the way of models, not only in the form of metalwork crosses as so convincingly argued by Henry (1965, 140), but in the form of monumental crosses of wood. In view of the paucity of evidence presented by contemporary written sources and the archaeological remains as outlined above, the evidence which the extant crosses of stone might provide becomes of vital importance in trying to reconstruct the possible forms of these wooden crosses. It is proposed here that details of the morphology and construction of a number of the earliest stone crosses in Ireland and the west of Scotland suggest that they were based upon, or strongly influenced by wooden models. On the basis of the evidence presented by the extant stone crosses it may be hypothesized that a number of different forms of wooden cross, built to varying modes of construction, were current. Four major distinct but interrelated forms are suggested, each form evidenced by numbers of crosses which share similar characteristics of morphology. Each of these groups is presented here by a detailed analysis of between one and three representative members, indicating the distinctive characteristics which support the speculation that the crosses are skeuomorphs of wooden precursors. A number of high crosses from western Scotland are included with the Irish examples; the crosses of this region, particularly those in the modern shire of</page><page sequence="4">108 DOROTHY KELLY Fig. 33 a-c Cross at Kilbroney, Down: a. West face; b. East face; c. South face; d. Cross at Clonlea, Down, West face.</page><page sequence="5">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 109 Argyll, are so closely related to the Irish crosses that they may be regarded as belonging to an extended cultural 'province' at this time (Kelly, forthcoming 1993), and the evidence they present reinforces and extends the evidence provided by the Irish high crosses. GROUP 1. Kilbroney, county Down. Related: Clonlea, county Down; Glendalough, county Wicklow (Roadside Cross); Glendalough, county Wicklow (Temple-na-Skellig); Tarbert, Gigha, Argyll; Killean, Argyll. (Map, Fig. 44). At the site of Kilbroney is a monolithic unringed cross of granite some two and a half metres tall, c.30cm wide and over 18cm thick at the butt, narrowing to 28cm wide and 13cm thick at the apex, and with an armspan of 93cm (Fig.33a-c). The cross has a number of distinguishing characteristics: while the broad west face is cut to a relatively flat surface, as are the narrow north and south faces, the east face is markedly convex, as is indicated by the section, Fig. 34b-d. In place of the hollowed angles or 'armpits' cut through the full thickness of the cross at the junction of shaft and transom, such as are commonly found on Irish high crosses, there are recesses cut to a depth of 5.5cm, approximately one-third of the thickness of the shaft, in the west face only, with faint traces of carved ornament discernible on the flat surfaces of the recesses. Only this west face of the cross is ornamented, the ornament extending over the head of the cross, blank areas being left above it at the apex and below it on the shaft, with panels of ornament interspersed by blank areas continuing to the lowest visible part of the shaft. The narrow north and south faces are marked by vertical incised grooves running parallel to the angles, not symmetrically placed equidistant from the edges as with the edge-mouldings of other crosses but some 2.5cm from the west edge and 5.5cm from the east edge (Fig. 34b-d). The grooves continue along the lower and upper surfaces of the transom and are clearly visible on the ends of the transom as indicated on the section of the north arm (Fig. 34b). The cross, therefore, presents two quite different main faces to the viewer, the flatter west face ornamented, with an unusual version of the typical hollowed angles, the east without hollowed angles and without ornament but with its surface distinctively worked to a convex profile. This quite separate treatment of the two main faces is emphasised by the vertical incised lines on the narrow faces of the cross. The overall impression is of a monument originally conceived of in three vertical segments, the divisions indicated by the incised lines on the narrow faces which cut both shaft and transom: a sturdy central section, about 10.5cm in maximum thickness, is flanked by two thinner segments, each distinctively worked, the ornamented western segment, the thinnest of all, some 2.5cm thick, the plain convex eastern segment, some 5.5cm thick. These divisions are emphasised on the section (Fig. 34b-d) by arrows; a more complex section is found in the area of the junction of shaft and transom where the recesses are cut into the thick central section but the three major lines of the segments are still clearly marked (Fig. 34b). While high crosses with a composite structure are not uncommon in Ireland the particular nature of the structure suggested by the morphology of this cross can hardly have originated in stone. It might, however, be plausibly explained in terms of a wooden monument composed of vertical plank-like elements. The convex shape of the east face also seems likely to have been a characteristic which would have originated in wood. A number of crosses in Ireland and Scotland can be shown to be related to this cross at Kilbroney, principally by the particular feature of the treatment of the hollowed angles at the junction of shaft and transom. Perhaps closest to Kilbroney, both in form and geography, is a cross at Clonlea just 6km from the site of Kilbroney. Although badly</page><page sequence="6">110 DOROTHY KELLY i i I t t C Fig. 34 a.

This marking of the hollowed angles by circular or semi-circular recesses is also a feature of two crosses at Glendalough, one on the route of the old 'Pilgrim Road' (Leask n.d., 41, Fig. 19C), the other at Temple-na-Skellig (Leask n.d., 10, Fig. 18), and a cross at Tarbert on the island of Gigha in Argyll (RCAHMS 1971, Fig. 159); a cross at the site of Killean in Kintyre on which incised lines mark the hollowed angles (RCAHMS 1971, Fig. 140) seems also to be related to the group. None of these crosses, however, displays the distinctive convex working of one face seen at Kilbroney, and the narrow sides are only rarely marked by vertical lines suggestive of multi-piece construction. They seem, therefore, to lie further from the putative wooden prototypes than does Kilbroney, offering less faithful renderings of the complexity of structural detail which would have typified such prototypes. GROUP 2. Toureen Peakaun, county Tipperary; A'Chill, Canna, Inverness. Related: Glendalough, county Wicklow; Kilmartin, Argyll. The tall lower shaft, badly fractured and worn at the apex, and a separate stone, partly buried in the ground, identified (Waddell and Holland 1990, 175) as the upper shaft, are all that remain of a cross on the site of Toureen Peakaun (Fig. 35a,b). Further *' fragments of the cross, found during Duignan's excavation of the site in 1944, are now in the National Museum, Dublin. These comprise of a few badly spalled fragments of the head of the cross. A recent publication has presented a version of the possible original appearance of this cross (Waddell and Holland 1990, Fig. 7); the drawing presented here (Fig. 36Ba) is based on this reconstruction but omits the postulated separate extensions to the transom which are regarded by this writer as problematic. The cross, originally some 4.06m in height (Waddell and Holland 1990, 175), was apparently constructed in two main pieces. The lower shaft and narrow transom, less than 70cm wide when one excludes the postulated extensions, were cut from a single piece of stone; the upper shaft was apparently a separate piece tenoned into the upper surface of the transom (Waddell and Holland 1990,175). This upper shaft has what appears to be a massive tenon, 18.5cm high, 19.5cm wide and narrowing from 15cm to 12 cm in thickness, cut on its upper surface. The cross has a narrow rectangular section, the broad east and west faces tapering from 54 to 48cm in width, the maximum thickness some 23cm. On the broad faces the surface of the stone was cut back to give deep rebates at the edges, on the west face 7-8.5cm of stone cut away to a depth of 3.5cm, on the east face some 4cm of stone cut away to a depth of 2.5cm. The effect of this is to leave a narrow tongue of stone, 15-16cm thick, standing proud on each side of the main structure of the shaft (Section, Fig. 36Bb). This rebating curves inwards immediately above and below the attenuated transom to create the impression of hollowed angles (Fig. 36Ba) in similar fashion to some of the crosses of Group 1, for example the cross beside the Pilgrim's Road at Glendalough (Leask n.d., 41). The rebating ends near the butt of the shaft, the lowermost part of the shaft which was intended to be visible not being rebated, creating a kind of 'pedestal' at the foot. On the east face, at a point some 60cm above this pedestal where an equal-armed cross is incised on the broad face of the shaft, the rebating is abandoned for a distance of 30cm, resuming again above this. This feature is now best preserved on the north-east side of the cross where the upper and lower lines of the area lacking the rebated feature are clearly marked despite some damage to the surface of the stone (Fig. 35b). The cross is very</page><page sequence="8">112 DOROTHY KELLY Fig. 35 a,b. Cross shaft, Toureen Peakaun, Tipperary; a. West face; b. East face with upper shaft in foreground c.

It has been suggested by a number of researchers that this cross bears a relationship to wooden forms (Waddell and Holland 1990, 175, quoting the late Professor Michael Duignan; Harbison 1978, 57, quoting the late John Hunt). Duignan observed that, because of the constraints of the material available to the sculptor 'he set about making a joiner's cross, a cross of planks as it were. . .' (Waddell and Holland 1990, 175). His view of the cross as a 'joiner's cross', coloured in part by the belief that there were additional stones which extended the width of the transom, apparently was based on the use of multiple pieces of stone linked by mortice-and-tenon joints. This is indeed a significant characteristic of the Toureen Peakaun cross and the use of multiple pieces of stone, discussed below in detail in relation to the crosses of Group 3, seems to stem from carpentry methods. Also important, however, is the rebating of the edges of the shaft. This rebating might be regarded in either of two ways, either as a purely ornamental feature, a 'finishing' of the edges in a method comparable to those used in carpentry, or as indicating a more fundamental characteristic of the cross, one that suggests that the sculptor set about creating, not merely his own version of a 'joiner's cross', but a copy in stone of an existing wooden cross. If the rebating is to be regarded as a purely ornamental feature it is noteworthy that it is different on each broad face, more of the stone cut away on the east face, 7cm on either side, than on the west face, where a maximum of 4cm is cut away on either side. Despite the postulated difficulties of working the stone the cross is in fact very regularly sculpted and this distinction between the two main faces seems best viewed as having been intentional. Following the interpretation of the features of the Kilbroney cross one might suggest that here is another version of a cross conceived of in three separate upright elements: a stout supporting central element, up to 16cm thick and 54cm wide, flanked by two thinner elements which are slightly different to one another, that on the east up to 2.5cm thick and 45cm wide, that on the west up to 3.5cm thick and 37.5cm wide. Evidence which is regarded as supporting this interpretation comes from the curious interruption of the rebating of the edges on the east face of the cross. This feature is best interpreted in the light of the evidence provided by another cross, at A'Chill on the island of Canna, a dependency of Iona (RCAHMS 1982,147) about eighty kilometres north of it. This cross on Canna shares with Toureen Peakaun the unusual feature of the rebating of the edges of the broad faces at the angles of the cross (Figs. 36Aa, 37a,b). Like the Toureen Peakaun cross it has a narrow rectangular section, remarkably close in its main dimensions to the cross at Toureen Peakaun, 53.5cm wide and a maximum of 21.5cm thick near the butt. At each edge of the broad faces the outer 7-9cm has been cut back, creating a projecting tongue, 10-12cm thick, on each side of the cross (now surviving only on the north side except at the butt). At Canna this rebating runs almost from the butt of the monument - there is evidence for a 'pedestal' like that at Toureen Peakaun showing slightly above the present ground surface on the east side - for the full length of the lower shaft, curving around the pierced hollowed angles of the cross and continuing along the underside of the transom where it terminates close to the end of the arm (Fig. 37a,b). That this rebating was repeated on the upper shaft, which is now gone, is suggested by a worn stump on the upper face of the north arm. As at Toureen Peakaun, the section of this cross (Fig. 36Ab) suggests that the cutting away of the edges of the stone on the broad</page><page sequence="11">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 115 Fig. 37 Cross at A'Chill, Canna: a. East face; b. West face.</page><page sequence="12">116 DOROTHY KELLY faces may reflect a construction of three upright elements: a substantial central section, 53cm wide and 10-12cm thick, flanked by two narrower sections, that on the east up to 38.5cm wide and 7.5cm thick, that on the west similarly 38.5cm wide but only 3cm thick. This cross is less regularly sculpted than that at Toureen Peakaun, the projecting tongue on each side varying somewhat in depth and thickness, for example, as indicated by the section taken on the lower shaft (Fig. 36Ab). It is notable, however, that the rebating of the broad faces achieved a consistent width of the flanking elements on both east and west faces and we may suggest, therefore, that the different thicknesses of these two elements was intentional. Unlike that at Toureen Peakaun the cross at Canna is elaborately ornamented. Again a distinction was made between the main east and west faces. The carving on the west face, geometric and zoomorphic, is in low flat relief. On the east face the carving is anthropomorphic and zoomorphic and is in extremely high relief. Some ornament is found also on the rebated edges, mostly in low relief but on the east face, at a point on the shaft some 90cm above the upper line of the 'pedestal', this flat surface is broken by a feature in high relief. This feature, which is very marked from both front and side views (Figs. 36Aa, 37a), is best likened to a small tongue with curved outer edges protruding from the outer eastern element to lie flat across the extent of the main central section which is not covered by this outer skin. It is analogous to the feature marked by the termination of the rebating on the east face of the Toureen Peakaun cross, both occurring about half-way up the height of the lower shaft. In the interpretation of these crosses which recognises them as skeuomorphs of wooden plank-built crosses with three upright elements to their structures this may be explained as a functional feature, a method of securing the outer element to the central section on the original, perhaps by means of a rivet or bolt driven through the projecting wooden tongue. While not as clearly demonstrable as other evidence of a composite structure, one feature of the cross at Canna seems to imply a further complexity in the structure of the original model which is reflected in its form: the curving outwards of the central section, as reflected in the rebated edges, towards the ends of the arms, and the thickening of the rebated edge under the arm by the carving of an ornament in high relief, gives a very strong impression that the transom is supported on this central structure, suggesting that the transom was worked as a separate element on the original, wooden cross. A solid-ringed cross at Glendalough is related to the crosses at Toureen Peakaun and Canna by the feature of rebated edges. This is a very small cross, less than 1.5m in height, with minuscule arms, rather damaged, and small neat head (Leask n.d., 40, Fig. 18). As well as the ringed form other differences between this and the crosses at Toureen Peakaun and Canna may be noted: the rebating of the edges is confined to one face, thus this cross appears to reflect only two upright elements. The rebating, furthermore, is not confined to the shaft but is carried over the attenuated arms, apparently reflecting a structure where the thicker supporting element contains the arms, the flanking element consisting of an upright with a circular disc, ornamented with an equal-armed cross, at the top. The cutting back of the arms to match the rebating of the shaft makes a clearer division between the two upright elements and seems to support the idea that the rebating of the edges of the Canna and Toureen Peakaun crosses reflects a more fundamental characteristic than the mere ornamenting of the monument. In western Scotland the cross at Kilmartin, Argyll, also has the sides of the shaft on one of its broad faces cut back in a fashion which is reminiscent of the rebating of the edges of the crosses of this group (Allen and Anderson 1903, Fig. 411).</page><page sequence="13">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 117 GROUP 3. Kilnaruane, Bantry, county Cork; St Mary's Church, Rothesay, Bute, Argyll; Iona, Argyll (St. Oran's Cross and St John's Cross). Related: Clonca, county Donegal. The so-called Bantry Pillar at Kilnaruane is a tall, tapering shaft, 30cm wide at the butt, 25cm wide near the top, approximately 14cm thick, broken at a height of 2.14m above ground level. That this is a later break rather than part of the original construction of the monument is indicated by the fact that it severs panels of ornament at the top of both of the broad faces (Fig. 38a,b). At the top on both narrow north and south faces are vertical rectangular slots or grooves, open at the top, 3.85cm long, up to 3.2cm wide and 6.6cm deep on the south side, 6.3cm long, up to 3.5cm wide and 6cm deep on the north side (Section, Fig. 39Ab). The pillar has been the subject of a number of studies which have dealt principally with the panels of ornament on its broad north-west and south-east faces, and Henry suggested that it was probably the shaft of a high cross (Henry 1940, 108; 1964, 63). It has been suggested that the slots in the narrow faces of the pillar are in some undefined way related to the joining of either the transom or ring of the cross to the shaft but no concrete suggestions as to the original form of the cross have been advanced. Some impression of the original structure of this monument may be obtained by reference to the comparative evidence provided by crosses in western Scotland. Now at St Mary's Church, Rothesay, on the island of Bute, but originally from another unidentified site on the island (Hewison 1891, 412-16), is a short slab-like upright, 1.51m tall, 32 to 26cm in width and up to 9.5cm in thickness, with panels of carved ornament on its broad east and west faces (Fig. 38c,d). A short broad tenon, 3.2cm high, a maximum of 20cm wide and 4.2cm thick, is worked at the upper end of the stone. In the narrow north and south faces, 17.5cm and 18.5cm from the top of the shaft respectively, are narrow vertical mortice-holes, that on the south up to 9.5cm long, 4cm wide and 3cm deep, that on the north up to 8.5cm long, 5cm wide and 4.5cm deep. The similarity of these mortices to the slots noted on the Bantry pillar is indicated by a section taken across the shaft at this level (Fig. 39Bb). On this evidence it may be suggested that the slots on the Bantry Pillar were originally complete mortice holes like those at Rothesay, their present form, open at the upper end, a result of the fracturing of the shaft at this point. Although the stone at Rothesay has not received much attention in the modern literature it was recognised by Hewison (1891,410-11) as the shaft of a ringed high cross, an identification followed by Allen and Anderson (1903, 416). The constructional features of the cross at Rothesay, the tenon at the top of the shaft and the mortice holes in the sides, are closely comparable to features on St John's Cross at Iona. This cross and the cross known as St Oran's preserve the evidence which allows us to offer a reconstruction of the cross at Rothesay and ultimately the cross at Kilnaruane, Bantry. The remains of St Oran's Cross consist of a number of pieces, many very worn, including a virtually complete upper shaft, most of the transom, split into two unequal parts, and fragments of the lower shaft. The original construction of this cross, proposed on the basis of these remains, was complex, with mortice-and-tenon joints linking three separate pieces of stone which made up the lower shaft, the transom and the upper shaft, the mortice holes cut into the top and bottom of the transom, the complementary tenons worked at top of lower shaft and bottom of upper shaft (Fig. 40B, after RCAHMS 1982, 194). The construction of St John's Cross at Iona was more complex still, with up to eight separate pieces of pieces of stone used in the structure which can be reconstructed today (Fig. 40A, after RCAHMS 1982, 198). The lower shaft was apparently of two pieces: a small stone immediately below the transom was linked to the main piece of the lower</page><page sequence="14">118 DOROTHY KELLY Fig. 38 Cross shafts at Kilnaruane, Cork, and Rothesay, Bute: a.

The mortice holes in the sides of the shaft at Rothesay seem best interpreted, as suggested by Allen and Anderson (1903, 416), as sockets to take the separate quadrants of a composite ring like that of St John's Cross. The mortice holes to take the segments of the ring of St John's Cross are documented as 5.5cm deep, 11cm wide and 7.5cm thick on the upper shaft, and 9cm deep, 12cm wide and 6cm thick on the lower shaft (RCAHMS 1982, 201), just slightly greater in proportions than those, up to 4.5 by 9.5 by 5cm, on the cross-shaft at Rothesay. Similarly the fractured mortices of the Bantry shaft, the larger 6 by 6.3 by 3.5cm, may be plausibly interpreted as having been intended to take the separate quadrants of a composite ring. Since the fitting of separate lower ring quadrants would only have been possible in the context of a monument where shaft and transom were separate elements, we may further suggest that at the top of the Bantry shaft there would originally have been a tenon, like that on the Bute shaft which is similar to St. John's Cross, and in this instance also to St. Oran's, the tenon intended to link with a mortice in a separately cut transom, as on St. Oran's Cross, or a stone uniting transom and upper shaft as on St John's Cross, although insufficient evidence remains at Kilnaruane and Rothesay to allow us to indicate which. It is suggested above that Iona may have played a significant role in the dissemination of the concept of free-standing crosses of wood. In view of this the archaeological evidence presented by the stone crosses there, and the crosses of related form at Kilnaruane and at Rothesay, takes on great importance. Some relationship to wooden forms has been generally accepted in the case of the Iona crosses following the recognition by Stevenson that the composite structure of the major crosses at Iona 'supports to some extent Professor Sean 6 Riord?in's suggestion that the "Celtic" type of cross, that with the arms joined with a ring, is derived from a wooden prototype' (1956, 86). Stevenson does not further amplify on this observation and some who have followed him appear to consider that it is in the imitation of distinctive techniques rather than the copying of actual wooden crosses that the relationship to carpentry lies: the Report of the Royal Commission, for example, suggests that the origin of the ring at Iona can be explained as an attempt to repair damage to St John's Cross in antiquity 'with a composite stone ring based on the familiar techniques of carpentry, but not imitating an actual wooden cross' (RCAHMS 1982, 17). The evidence presented by the earliest of these crosses, St Oran's and St John's, however, seems to weigh in favour of their being direct imitations of wooden crosses. The evidence falls into two categories: the use of a number of pieces of stone to achieve the structure and the method of jointing. The type of joint used in these two crosses is the mortice-and-tenon joint, typically used in carpentry. The use of this form of joint is extremely well represented in the Irish material: virtually all of the Irish crosses have at least one mortice-and-tenon joint, since this was the method used to link cross and base; it was also the form used to secure the cap, usually a separate stone, to the main structure of the cross, when this feature was included. In addition a number of crosses of the Irish series have a joint in the lower shaft, again typically a mortice-and-tenon joint, as for example on the south cross at Castledermot, county Kildare, or the two crosses at Drumcliff, county Sligo. One Irish cross, at Inishmacsaint, county Fermanagh, is particularly interesting in this context as it has a mortice-and-tenon joint between the top of the lower shaft and the single stone which forms the transom and upper shaft, a mortice hole in the top of this indicating a further element at the top of the cross (HMNI 1983, PI. 114); this structure is closely</page><page sequence="17">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 121 Fig. 40 Crosses at Iona: A. St. John's; B. St. Oran's (after RCAHMS 1982). comparable to that of St. John's cross at Iona (Fig. 40A). The mortice-and-tenon joints of the crosses at Iona are, therefore, not unique and it must be acknowledged that this evidence does little more than indicate that the techniques used in their construction are probably borrowed from the craft of carpentry. What is distinctive about the crosses of Iona is the extensive use of these joints, because of the use of an unusual number of stones to make the crosses. In the case of St Oran's Cross separate stones were used for lower shaft, transom and upper shaft (Fig. 40B); in the case of St John's Cross separate stones, at least, were used for lower shaft, transom and part of the upper shaft, the remainder of the upper shaft with its finial, and the four quadrants of the composite ring (Fig. 40 A). [The bases are not included in this analysis but the use of a large number of stones to create the composite base for St John's Cross is also striking; the Report of the Royal Commission compares its structure to those of composite stone shrines which may have been modelled on wooden prototypes (RCAHMS 1982, 19)]. Considering the material actually used for the crosses it may be argued that the structure of these monuments is not only unnecessarily complex but also had the effect of incorporating structural frailties. It may be noted in this context that the only cross to survive relatively intact at Iona is St Martin's Cross, which is virtually monolithic, having only slots at the ends of the arms to take what was probably an ornamental feature (RCHAMS 1982, 205). Both St Oran's and St John's crosses are in a highly fragmented</page><page sequence="18">122 DOROTHY KELLY state (RCAHMS 1982,194,198). Why should the sculptors at Iona have chosen to produce such structurally complex monuments? An assessment of the qualities of the two media, wood and stone, and the constraints which working with these materials impose on the craftsman bears directly on this question. Perhaps the first constraint is the supply of material. Here a number of variables may apply: suitability, availability and quantity, particularly the quantity of material of the required extent or proportions. As Henry pointed out (1964, 15-16) it appears that it was the sources of suitable stone closest to a site which were exploited for the construction of the Irish high crosses. However a large number of crosses, found in areas where none of the most suitable stone - sandstone or granite for example - is available, are carved from less reliable stones such as shale and slate, and it has been argued that the characteristics of these materials which made them difficult to work apparently prompted modifications in design which would minimise the problems involved, the most striking being the use of the solid, rather than the pierced ring (Kelly 1986, 64). The earliest crosses at Iona, however, seem to run contrary to this observed behaviour in that they combine complex structure with difficult material: the stones used for St Oran's Cross, considered the earliest of this group (Stevenson 1956, 88; RCAHMS 1982,197), a flaggy mica-granulite for the lower shaft and mica-schist for the transom and upper shaft, both present difficulties for the sculptor, the latter very coarse for sculpting, the former 'fatally susceptible to lamination' (RCAHMS 1982, 192). It might be suggested in view of the nature of the material that a monolithic structure would have been a more suitable option. That the sculptors appear, despite the difficulties posed by their material, to have been intent on creating a composite cross of such a size and scale as to pose structural difficulties might be argued to indicate that they had deeply ingrained ideas as to how these crosses should be constructed, especially in view of the possibility that models less complex in structure were extant in the earliest stone crosses of Northumbria at the time (Cramp, 1984, 27) and likely to have been known to the Iona community. The evidence of the earliest crosses at Iona speaks of a number of possibilities, or perhaps more likely a combination of these. Firstly that the sculptors were not expert in judging the qualities of various types of stone; this runs contrary to the impression given in the Report of the Royal Commission when it speaks of imported sculptors (1982,18), a suggestion which carries the implication of expertise, which was apparently not considered to be available at Iona. Secondly, that sources of suitable stone were not readily available to the island community; however, we know that the stones for the crosses there came from as far afield as the mainland of Argyll and perhaps even the island of Colonsay (RCAHMS 1982, 201, 205, 209), and the stone used for St Martin's cross, while difficult to work, was certainly most suitable, as testified by its survival intact to the present day. Since the complex structures of the two earliest crosses seem to hinder rather than help to solve the difficulties created by the poor quality stone, it may be that the design features are a result of other constraints; indeed it might be argued that the design characteristics were the single most important consideration, overriding considerations of material. Supplies of wood suitable for the construction of monumental crosses would also have had to be imported. We have evidence of the conveying of timber from the mainland during the lifetime of Adomn&amp;n: although some of the buildings on Iona were of wattle (Anderson and Anderson 1961, 328-29) it is clear that a number of buildings were substantial timber structures for which large quantities of timber had to be imported, and that timber was also imported for ship-building. Speaking of miracles wrought by the relics of Colmcille, Adomn&amp;n tells of the community at</page><page sequence="19">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 123 Iona invoking the relics to ensure favourable weather for the task of transporting the timber: Prima vice, cum dolataeper terrampineae et roboreae traherentur longae navis et magnae navium pariter materiae eveherentur domus, beati viri vestimenta et libros inito consilio super altare cum salmis et jejunatione et ejus nominis invocatione possuimus, ut a domino ventorum prosperitatem nobis profuturam inpetraret.

On the first occasion when dressed timbers of pine and oak for a long ship were being drawn over land, and timbers were being conveyed for the great house, as well as for ships, we adopted the plan of laying garments and books of the blessed man upon the altar, with psalms and fasting, and invocation of his name; in order that he might obtain from the Lord prosperous winds in our favour. And so it happened, God granting it to that holy man. For on the day on which our sailors had made all ready and intended with boats and curachs to tow the pieces of timber through the sea, the winds that had been contrary on previous days were suddenly changed to propitious ones. On the second occasion, some years later, when twelve curachs had been collected, and other oak timbers were being towed by us from the mouth of the river Sale, for the restoration of our monastery, one day, while in still weather the sailors were sweeping the sea with their oars, suddenly the wind Favonius, which is also called Zephyrus, arose against us. (Anderson and Anderson 1961, 452-5) The impression given by these passages is that the importation of large quantities of timber, while by no means an everyday event, was something undertaken at least sporadically by the community; it would appear furthermore that there was no great difficulty in acquiring supplies of large timbers. The descriptions also imply a pool of skilled labour available to the community for the working of the timber, not only for buildings but also for the highly specialised craft of ship-building. The expertise in wood-working available at Iona in the seventh century is confirmed by finds of wooden objects in the excavations undertaken there (Barber 1981). Of particular interest is a wooden post 1.1m long, slotted on its narrow faces (Barber 1981, Fig. 37, no. 447 196; RCAHMS 1982, Fig. p.15, E and F). The section of this worked timber is broadly comparable to the sections taken across the mortice holes on the shafts at Kilnaruane and Rothesay and is shown here with them in Fig. 39C. The record then shows the skills, traditions of wood-working and supplies of material for the construction of monumental wooden crosses to have been available at Iona in the seventh and eighth centuries; the main constraint in regard to their construction, therefore, may well have been that of</page><page sequence="20">124 DOROTHY KELLY creating a cross of the form and size desired within the limits of the naturally occurring dimensions of the wood. The crosses at Iona are impressive in size. St John's cross for example is up to 5.3m tall, excluding the base (RCHAMS 1982, 201), comparing with the upper range of heights of the crosses of the Irish series, some of which are between 5 and 7m tall (Kelly 1986, Fig. 2). A distinctive feature, seen on St John's and St Oran's crosses and also associated with some Irish crosses, is the impressive span of the transom in relation to the other dimensions of the cross. To take the example of St Oran's Cross, although one can envisage no great difficulty in acquiring a single piece of wood of the required width (c.55cm), depth (c.24cm) and height (in excess of 1.82m) for the shaft of the cross, one can envisage very real problems in finding a single piece of wood of sufficient dimensions to accommodate also the width of the transom (1.99m). [Expert opinion suggests that it would be quite impossible to obtain timber of such dimensions to-day without recourse to sources such as the Giant Redwoods of North America]. In wood-working, where joints are commonplace, the obvious solution to this problem is to cut the transom from a separate piece of wood and tenon the upper and lower shafts into this. This indeed may well be argued to be the most desirable method in wood since the transom would then be cut lengthwise from a tree, the grain of the wood running with the spread of the transom. The cross thus created would in effect be composed of three planks of wood, one each for transom, upper shaft and lower shaft. It can be argued, therefore, that compelling reasons exist for a sculptor in wood wishing to construct a monumental cross of the form and dimensions of St Oran's Cross to employ precisely the method by which this stone cross was made. Can one suggest similar reasons for constructing a stone cross in this fashion? Bailey, discussing an Anglo-Saxon Viking Age cross from Winwick in Lancashire (1980,240-42), appears to believe so when he asserts: 'It would obviously have been difficult to win both the shaft and the six-foot arm-spread of the... cross from the same stone'. Yet it is difficult to envisage a situation where adequate areas of stone to accommodate the sort of dimensions discussed here would not have been available; difficulties might then only relate to the technical abilities of those quarrying the stone. It might be argued further that, although only occasionally achieving the ambitious dimensions of the Iona and Winwick crosses, a number of Irish crosses do incorporate impressive arm-spans in monolithic structures; Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice, county Louth, for example, has an arm-span of 2.15m, of one piece with the lower shaft, the whole over 4m high. On the other hand the nature of the stone might well entail difficulties for the working of multiple pieces, each to be cut back quite severely in order to create the elements of complex joints. Such techniques are rarely used in free-standing sculptures, the sculpting of complex subjects in stone usually being achieved by the cutting back of a single large block. St John's Cross is similar in construction to St Oran's, the cruciform element differing only in that part of the upper shaft was cut from the same stone as the transom, with the additional complication of a composite ring. The continuing use of several pieces of stone to create a composite monument seems to demonstrate the strength of the early tradition at Iona and appears to argue against the epithet 'experimental' applied to these crosses (Stevenson 1956, 89; RCAHMS 1982, 18). This cross is a highly ambitious work of great complexity, evidenced not only by its structure but also by the indications that provision was made for the inclusion of separate ornamental features: the two circular recessed features on the west face, one at the centre of the head, the other in the upper part of</page><page sequence="21">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 125 the lower shaft, have been interpreted as designed to hold large metal bosses (RCAHMS 1982, 203). The complexity implied by the inclusion of these features is very much in keeping with that of the composite structure and supports a suggestion that the monument was conceived of in a complex form, including the composite ring (Kelly 1990, 117-121). Despite the argument that the ring is a secondary feature added after the cross had been damaged in a fall (RCHAMS 1982, 201) there is no persuasive evidence to suggest that it was not part of the original structure. As with St Oran's Cross, therefore, constraints of material seem to underlie an explanation of the complexity of the structure of St John's Cross. The composite ring makes little sense in stone and its construction would have caused difficulties such as the cutting of mortice holes in pieces which must already have been worked to their final shape, if perhaps still lacking carved ornament. Furthermore, in this case there seems little reason to doubt the possibility of winning a single piece of stone which could allow for the inclusion of an integral ring: the upper quadrants are accommodated by the height of the upper shaft, to include the lower quadrants and part of the lower shaft would have added a mere 44cm to the extent of the stone required, 2.12 x 1.57m as opposed to the existing 2.12 x 1.13m. If, however, we consider the possibility that St. John's Cross was modelled on a wooden prototype then the structure might be explained by the difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently large expanse of timber in a single piece to accommodate these dimensions, and indeed the problems of trying to create a monumental cross from a single huge piece of timber: observation of modern wooden crosses, often used as temporary grave-markers in cemeteries, indicates that even relatively small crosses of about a metre in height, like one in the grave-yard at Kilbroney, illustrated here (Fig. 41d), are often composite in structure, shaft and transom united by a half-mortice joint reinforced by dowels or screws at the crossing. As with St Oran's Cross the composite structure of St John's Cross is inappropriate to a stone structure but essential to a cross carved from wood; the structures of these two crosses and those at Rothesay and Kilnaruane speak of a direct dependence on wooden models. One other Irish cross, at Clonca, county Donegal (Lacy et al. 1983, PI. V), seems to be related to this group, if at a slight remove. The Clonca cross resembles in its plank-like form the Bantry shaft and some of the crosses at Iona; like them also it has a distinctive approach to the presentation of ornament, which, as on the Bantry shaft and St Martin's Cross at Iona, begins some distance up the lower shaft. The existing remains, however, do not display any evidence of an original construction as complex as those discussed above. It may be that this cross represents a variation on the type, dispensing with the composite structure in favour of a very narrow transom, at Clonca only an estimated 90cm wide (Lacy et al. 1983, 255), which on a wooden prototype could conceivably have been cut in one piece with the shaft.

Ahenny North (Fig. 41a,b,) is a sandstone cross with a pierced ring which is deeply recessed, each segment chamfered on its upper surface. The shaft of the cross has a broad rectangular section with a pronounced integral pedestal at its foot above a massive trapezoidal base with double step. The outline of the cross is defined by a single heavy hachured edge-moulding, largely broken away on the lower shaft. On the narrow north and south faces this is paralleled by inner mouldings similar in form but slighter; between these inner mouldings the surface of the stone is deeply recessed. A massive dome- or beehive-shaped cap, cut from a separate piece of stone, surmounts the cross, overhanging the edges of the upper shaft. The cross-head is marked by a cruciform setting of five bosses on each broad face, one at the centre of the head, one in each limb, some of which lie approximately over the projected line of the ring. Features such as the heavy hachured mouldings, the duplication of these on the flat narrow faces, the massive trapezoidal stepped base, the integral pedestal at the foot of the shaft, the overhanging capstone and its domed form, and the cruciform setting of bosses on the head of the cross relate it to others of the Ahenny Group. Also related to this group, although regarded as slightly later, are the crosses at Killamery (Fig. 41c) and Kilree and the South Cross at Clonmacnois. Each has a number of features which compare closely with those of the Ahenny Group. The cross at Killamery is of particular interest here. This is a sandstone cross with a pierced, slightly recessed ring. Pronounced hachured edge-mouldings follow the outline of the cross at the angles; on the narrow faces these are paralleled by similar but slighter mouldings placed some 10cm inside them, the surface of the shaft recessed between these inner mouldings. A pronounced integral pedestal at the foot of the lower shaft is unique in its form, narrowing from top to bottom above a double stepped base. The ends of the transom are finished with flat unfacetted panels, their edges standing proud of the rest of the structure of the transom. A roof-shaped cap cut from a separate stone completes the monument. These are crosses which have attracted intense research interest and a number of significant statements have been presented which have greatly enhanced our understanding of the characteristics of these crosses and those which have traditionally been regarded as having succeeded them. In terms of explanations of features of form perhaps the most significant contributions have come from Henry (1964, 22, 26; 1965, 140) and Richardson (1984, 130-34). Henry's hypothesis that the crosses of this group owe much to metalwork offered an explanation, not just for their carved ornament, but also for aspects of their form such as the massive bosses of those of the group which survive complete and the heavy hachured roll-mouldings which follow the outline of the crosses. Richardson, in interpreting the capstones of this group as representations of the domed building over the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, has offered an explanation for the unusual form taken by this feature of the crosses at Ahenny and Kilkieran. A number of the features, including the hachured edge-mouldings and the forms of the bosses, as well as the chip-carved ornament, seem to support Henry's argument; some details, however, suggest a more complex background, such as, for example, the chamfering of the ring, a technique more at home in the context of wood-working. It is suggested here that many of the distinctive morphological features of the crosses, and some of the ornamental features, are more plausibly explained in terms of a dependence on a composite monumental prototype of wood, this view allowing an explanation of a number of distinctive features which cannot be satisfactorily accounted</page><page sequence="24">128 DOROTHY KELLY for by Henry's thesis which looked only at the features derived from metalwork. These features, which are either unique to the group or are found on these crosses in a very pronounced form, the same characteristics when found on later crosses being very much subdued, have raised questions which still remain to be answered. The questions relate, for example, to the roll-mouldings carved on the faces of the narrow sides of the crosses; to the feature of a pronounced pedestal at the foot of the shaft, to which Roe has drawn attention (1962, 8); and to the severely recessed chamfered ring. Questions also remain about the capstones of these and later crosses of the Irish series. Richardson draws attention to parallel developments in erecting Christian monuments, citing the stelae of the fifth to seventh centuries in Caucasia (1984,130), which display representations of the Holy Sepulchre; these, however, unlike Irish capstones which surmount the monument, are contained within the structure of the stele below a small equal-armed cross which is placed at the apex. Richardson's implied comparisons in fact draw attention to the curious treatment of the capstones of the Irish crosses. They prompt the question as to why should there was such a marked preference for cutting the cap as a separate element, necessitating the use of complex joints, when it might have been carved in one piece with the upper shaft, as happens in a very few instances on tenth century or later crosses such as the West Cross (Flann's Cross) at Clonmacnois, the West Cross at Durrow, county Offaly, and a cross at Tully, county Dublin. A number of the crosses of this group have distinctive edge-mouldings which Henry suggested were skeuomorphs of C-shaped metal strips designed to cover the edges of adjacent sheets of bronze (1965, 140). These rounded mouldings also occur on other crosses but a peculiarity of some of the Ossory group, not found on any other monuments, is that these mouldings are not restricted to the corners of the crosses: on each of the narrow faces two additional mouldings run inside and parallel to the main edge- or corner-mouldings (Fig. 41b). As the edge-mouldings are considered to relate to joints in the bronze sheet of the proposed prototype it seems a logical assumption that these additional mouldings also relate to joints. Yet there is no obvious reason to have used a number of separate metal sheets to cover the faces of the cross, particularly the narrow faces. One might, therefore, propose that if these mouldings indicate joints that these joints relate, not so much to the covering metal sheets as to the structure underneath them in the postulated prototype cross. The number and positions of the raised mouldings on the Ossory crosses would suggest that the postulated prototype would have been a structure composed of three upright plank-like elements, in other words a structure not dissimilar to those proposed for Groups 1 and 2 above. A section (Fig. 42B) taken on the shaft of the South Cross at Ahenny (which retains more of its edge mouldings than the North Cross at this site) indicates these three elements, closer in thickness than those discussed above, the central segment some 12.5cm thick, flanked by the outer segments, that on the west some 10.5cm thick, that on the east about 9cm thick. In marked contrast, however, to the cross at Kilbroney, where all three elements are of the same width, and the crosses at Toureen Peakaun and Canna, where the central section is substantially wider than the two flanking elements, here the central section is markedly narrower at 35cm wide than the two flanking elements which are some 40cm wide (all of these measurements relate to the basic structure and exclude the protruding ornamental edge-mouldings). We see in this section, therefore, the probable reason for the necessity to create breaks in the metal sheeting of the prototype cross, a need caused by the underlying wooden structure. This is the first of these groups of crosses apparently based on prototypes composed of three upright, laminated elements which includes a ring and it seems that the inclusion</page><page sequence="25">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 129 of the ring may have been significant in deciding the relative widths of the three upright elements. The rings on Irish high crosses are commonly carved in a different plane to the rest of the monument, their surfaces recessed in relation to those of the broad faces of the cross. Usually this recessing is slight, little more than one or two centimetres in total. On the crosses at Ahenny and Kilkieran, however, the rings are severely recessed, to the depth in fact of the central upright element of the shaft of the cross (Fig. 41b); viewed from the side the overall structure gives a very distinct impression that the segments of the ring are clamped between the two projecting flanking upright elements of the shaft. In the interpretation offered here this impression is regarded as more than fortuitous, rather it is proposed that the construction of the shaft with the two outer plates projecting well beyond the central element, the converse of that seen on the unringed crosses, was designed to allow for the fixing of the ring, in effect by clamping it in place. This further implies that on the prototype the ring was a separate element. Thus a picture of a highly complex structure begins to emerge. This view of the complex wooden component of the prototypes of the Ossory crosses may allow us to propose for the first time an explanation for other distinctive features of these crosses. The use of a separate stone for the cap, and its positioning at the apex of these monuments, for example, may be more comprehensible in an interpretation of these crosses as skeuomorphs of composite plank-built originals. In this scenario the cap might be regarded as providing solutions to two problems: securing the ends of the separate elements of the structure and counteracting the effects of climate and weather and consequential warping and rotting of the top of such a composite wooden structure. With regard to the latter the use of a solid block of wood, particularly roof- or house-shaped, at the top of a plank-built structure would have two advantages, providing run-off of rain and covering the raw edges of the planks at that point. There is a feature of these early crosses which might be argued to allow that the solid cap could also have functioned as a fastening. As with other elements of these stone crosses, mortice-and-tenon joints are used to link the cap to the main structure of the cross. There is an option which had to be faced in regard to the location of the complementary elements of such a joint: was the mortice hole to be placed in the shaft and the tenon on the cap or vice versa? The loss of the capstone from quite a number of crosses, exposing the element at the top of the shaft, provides evidence that both options were taken. At least twenty-three Irish crosses can be demonstrated to have had separate caps. Of these no evidence of the relative positioning of the elements of the joint is available for ten crosses because the capstones are still in place; of the remainder, seven have a mortice hole in the shaft and at least six can be shown to have a projecting tenon on the shaft. The most interesting group is comprised of monuments which can be demonstrated to have had tenons on the shaft: these can still be seen on one late cross, at Tuam, county Galway, and also on a number of earlier crosses at Kilree, county Kilkenny, and at Kells (Tower Cross) and Duleek (North Cross), county Meath. Tenons at the apex of the shaft matched by mortices in the capstones were recorded on the decorated West Cross and the plain East Cross at Kilkieran by O'Curry in 1839 (RIA MS 12T1) and, given the very close relationship of these crosses to the two at Ahenny, we can perhaps allow that the tenons on these latter crosses are also probably located at the top of the shaft (Kelly 1985b, 160-61). O'Neill's drawing of the Tall Cross at Moone, county Kildare (1857, PL 18), also suggests a tenon at the top but this evidence is somewhat problematic as Stokes (1901, 544) states that there was a mortice hole in the upper shaft. On stone crosses belonging to an early stratum of the Irish series where the evidence is</page><page sequence="26">130 DOROTHY KELLY available, therefore, the tenon of the joint which secured the cap was apparently located on the shaft. If one thinks in terms of composite plank-built prototypes it might be envisaged that on these each plank would have had a small tenon left at the top which together with its counterparts might make a larger composite tenon to fit a mortice hole in the cap; this would have the effect of holding together the separate elements of the structure at the top of the cross (Fig. 42Ab, 43A). It is of great interest that at Toureen Peakaun also the cross, interpreted here as reflecting a wooden prototype having a similar multiple-plank structure, is surmounted by a large projecting tenon, which, it has been proposed, was possibly intended to take a finial (Waddell and Holland 1990, 175). The interpretation offered here in regard to the original function of capstones on Irish high crosses would explain not only the particular positioning of these features but also the peculiar penchant for cutting the capstone from an individual piece of stone. One further piece of evidence might be deployed to support this theory. It relates to a problem which can be envisaged for the makers of the postulated wooden prototype: the tenoning of the outer planks would require that the cap be of greater dimensions than the top of the shaft to allow a sufficiently large mortice hole to be cut safely from its core. Roe, discussing the question of whether the capstones of the Ossory crosses can be regarded as original, remarked 'it is obvious that they do not fit the shafts' (1962,13), and indeed the surviving caps of the crosses at Ahenny and Kilkieran clearly are wider than the shafts on which they sit, overhanging their edges, particularly at the broad faces (Fig. 41a,b). This is a characteristic also of the later but related cross at Killamery; this, unlike Ahenny and Kilkieran, has a small, roof-shaped cap which nevertheless also overhangs the edges of the shaft (Fig. 41c). The problem of securing and protecting the raw ends of a composite plank-built structure would also apply to the butt of the cross. The fixing of the planks in the mortice hole cut in the separate block which formed the base of the cross might seem to offer a solution to this problem. An examination of the stone crosses indicates that the task of matching the mortice hole in the base with a tenon of the relevant dimensions was in fact a minor part of the task of creating a stable monument. That a worked tenon sitting on its point in a mortice clearly did not provide sufficient stability seems to be indicated by the treatment, both of the butt of the cross and the base, which may be observed on a number of examples where these parts of the structure has been revealed. The shaft of the cross in these cases can be seen to be undercut at the point where the tenon begins, creating an overhanging ledge above it; this is often matched by the cutting of a bevel or slightly reduced ledge around the the mouth of the mortice hole in the base, obviously intended to engage with the ledge created on the butt of the shaft. Thus the weight of the cross is distributed evenly around the shaft rather than resting on the worked tenon, the tenon itself stabilising the cross in its base and redressing severe tilt rather than providing the sole support for the structure. One can envisage, however, that the slender raw ends of a plank-built structure would necessitate a quite different treatment, one which would clamp together the various pieces and prevent twisting and splitting. It is proposed here that the construction of a box or 'shoe', cut from a solid block of wood, with an integral tenon below, would provide a suitable solution to the problem. Such a structure would secure and stabilize the elements of the shaft without the need to cut them back severely, and provide a solid stable platform at the top of the base. Inevitably this 'shoe' would have to be of greater dimensions than the butt of the shaft, thus creating to all intents and purposes a 'pedestal' at the foot of the shaft above its junction with the base (Fig. 42Ab, 43A), in other words a structure very similar those</page><page sequence="27">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 131 which are a distinctive feature of members of the Ossory group of crosses, the North Cross at Ahenny, the shafts at Lorrha, the West Cross at Kilkieran and particularly the cross at Killamery, where the pedestal narrows from the top to its junction with the base (Fig. 41c). Similar features are found on later crosses but are much diminished in proportions, suggesting that they stand further from the prototype and retain no memory of the original function of the feature. An explanation may thus be offered for the method of securing the individual vertical members of the crosses at top and bottom. It seems it would also have been necessary to bolt or rivet the upright elements together at some point along their length, as is indicated by the evidence at Toureen Peakaun and Canna. Although no features such as those noted at Toureen Peakaun and Canna can be observed on the Ossory crosses, one characteristic feature of these early crosses, the setting of five bosses in a cruciform layout at the head of the cross (Fig. 41a), might relate to the securing of the elements of the wooden prototype. Henry suggested that these bosses might represent 'the studs covering the rivetting of the two sides' - that is the bronze sheets of a metalwork prototype (1965,140); this, however, fails to take into account the wooden cross to which the plates would have been fixed. The evidence of contemporary objects of metalwork constructed around a wooden core, such as house-shaped shrines for example (Mahr and Raftery 1941, Pis. 16, 17), indicates that the metal cladding is pinned to the internal structure by tiny round-headed nails. These tiny nails appear to have been found perfectly adequate for the task of fixing metal plates to organic materials, and were apparently aesthetically acceptable. Thus Harbison's suggestion, that the bosses of these crosses represent studs which 'on the prototype crosses-could have covered up the nails which fastened the metal sheets to the wooden core of the cross' (1977, 283), while perhaps more pertinent than Henry's, is still at variance with the evidence of extant metalwork which suggests that it was apparently not felt necessary to conceal these nail-heads on metalwork pieces. Studs on contemporary metalwork, on the other hand, are either purely ornamental, as on the girdle immediately below the rim of the Ardagh chalice for example (Organ 1973,255-58, Fig. 44), or may be used to conceal important structural features such as rivets, as on the handles of the chalice (Organ 1973, 241). If we follow Henry and Harbison in assuming that the studs of the prototype of the Ahenny crosses performed a concealing, functional role rather than a simply ornamental one, we might suggest on the evidence reviewed above that the studs covered, not rivets joining metal sheets as suggested by Henry or nails fixing metal sheets to a wooden core as suggested by Harbison, but a fastening with a more substantial role, a rivet or bolt, or perhaps a dowel, holding together the upright planks of the wooden structure. In fact the evidence of the North Cross at Ahenny and the West Cross at Kilkieran may indicate a more complex situation. The discrepancy in the size of the bosses on the west faces of these two crosses is curious: in both cases we find an arrangement of two large bosses, one at the centre of the head, one on the lower shaft, and three less substantial bosses deployed in the arms and upper shaft (Fig. 41a). It seems possible that what is reflected here is the use of both purely ornamental studs and others performing a concealing function, the different roles indicated by the difference in size. It is worth noting here the drilled holes on the head of the cross at Toureen Peakaun; in their positioning (Fig. 36Ba) they compare broadly with the bosses on the shaft and transom of the crosses at Ahenny and Kilkieran and it may be that they reflect a similar phenomenon on the prototype cross. Figures 42Ab, 43A present exploded drawings of the postulated wooden structure on which the Ossory crosses may be based, as indicated by the evidence discussed above;</page><page sequence="28">132 DOROTHY KELLY the drawing is not intended to represent any particular one of the crosses but imitates the distinctive form of a number of the group with low-slung transom, deeply recessed ring, large domed cap and pronounced pedestal between cross and base. The drawings show the main structure of the cross as composed of three separate elements, a central core flanked by two outer planks. The ring is shown as a separate unit and the ring quadrants and the central core have mating mortice-and-tenon half-joints, necessary to place the ring in the same plane as the central element but also providing some support for the ring. The bosses at the centre of the head and on the lower shaft, interpreted as capping or covering the dowels or rivets, are shown with dowels protruding from one side. Perhaps the most tantalizing question raised by this interpretation is that of how the transom was structured and united with the other elements, since no clear morphological evidence is presented by the stone crosses which might indicate how the transom was treated on the original. Any suggestions as to the possible structure of the transom on the postulated prototype are therefore more speculative than those made in relation to other elements and the solutions offered here are just some possible options. The armspans of the Ossory crosses are on the whole quite modest, closer to a metre wide than to the two-metre spans of St John's and St Oran's crosses, and it is just possible that shaft and transom could have been cut from a single timber. Some of the later crosses such as that at Clonmacnois (West cross) or Monasterboice (East and South crosses) have facetted ends to the transom which, it has been suggested (Harbison 1977, 286), may be modelled on bosses of truncated pyramidal shape made of bronze. The crosses of the Ossory group, however, end in flatter terminals. At Killamery these terminals give the impression of being solid, almost box-like structures which stand proud of the arms, appearing to cap them (Fig. 41c). Such an interpretation would accord with a view of the transom on the prototype as a composite structure, as in Fig. 42Ab. At Ahenny and Kilkieran the heavy roll mouldings are continued on to the ends of the arms disguising this feature to a large extent but it is clear that the structure is in any event different from that at Killamery. Looked at head-on the terminals have two concentric rectangular mouldings which create a rectangular flat sunken centre bordered by an outer flat edging. This may be a purely ornamental treatment of the arm ends. It might, however, be based, if at some remove, on a collar-like structure with the centre cut away allowing it to slot over the reduced or tenoned ends of the arms, thus fixing the planks together. It may be, however, especially in view of the analysis undertaken for Group 3 above, that one should envisage a separately cut transom and for this two versions might be suggested. In one version (Fig. 43A) the transom is cut from a single piece of wood which at the extremities matches the combined thicknesses of all three upright sections but which is cut back at the centre of its span to match the thickness of the central upright only. The transom is joined to the central sections of upper and lower shafts by mortice-and-tenon joints. The flanking uprights of the cross when slotted into place cover this complex of joints at the core supporting and securing the multi-piece inner structure. An alternative solution would be to use a different form of joint, a mortice-and-tenon half-joint, between the thicker central upright and the transom, the outer elements again covering and securing this structure. Support for the validity of using this form of joint between shaft and transom comes in the form of a modern wooden cross, some 1.5m tall, used as a grave-marker in the cemetery of the ancient church site of Kilbroney. Here (Fig. 41 d) the shaft and transom are two separate pieces linked by a mortice-and-tenon half-joint which is strengthened by the use of screws at the crossing, in the position of the central bosses on the Ossory Group of crosses; against this it should be pointed out that</page><page sequence="29">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 133 W\ [f\ ff) ffS W? w n?* fTirr^iyn?* L-^r-r, ft Wr^lMff \ XXX&gt;\ r ^u U U u B ????-^=^= 20cm Fig. 42 Ahenny, Tipperary Aa.

Detail of transom.</page><page sequence="31">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 135 we have no evidence for the use of this type of joint from the surviving stone monuments, understandably so, since it could not have been effectively translated into stone. The Wider Tradition The evidence of the four groups of crosses presented and interpreted above as reflecting prototype wooden crosses may be supported by the evidence from other crosses not discussed in detail here. The complexity of the structures of the crosses of Group 3 is matched, for example, by remains at one other site at Emlagh in county Roscommon. Here there are seven stones, the remains of two, possibly even three crosses, which demonstrate the use of a great variety of methods of jointing. The remains of a mortice hole in one piece, perhaps part of the head of a cross, is the only evidence at this site of the use of the mortice-and-tenon joint so commonly found in crosses of the Irish series. The head of a second cross (Fig. 35d), has an unusual tenon projecting from its lower limb; on one face at least (all of the other face is not at present visible), this joint is flush with the surface of the cross indicating that it could not have mated with a normal mortice hole but rather would have had to have been matched with an open-ended groove at the top of the lower shaft of the monument. This would have ensured that the elements of the joint would have remained visible, as in the carpentry form of dove-tail joint which this most resembles. Two other stones, apparently the shafts from separate crosses, one still standing in its base, have deep slots, from 5.5 to 7cm wide and 12 to 16cm in depth, cut in their narrow sides; like the Bantry shaft both of these stones have been fractured across the line of the grooves (Fig. 35d). The precise function of these slots is not clear. If they were intended to take the quadrants of a composite ring the position of those on one shaft fragment would imply an unusually dwarfed lower shaft, furthermore, by comparison with the mortices cut to take composite rings on the other crosses examined here these are cut exceptionally deep. They could perhaps have been part of a complex jointing system to link separate elements of the shaft of a cross but if so there is no evidence now visible of projecting features which would mate with these slots. Despite difficulties in interpreting the evidence at Emlagh the adventurous use of particular wood-working forms otherwise rarely represented in the Irish series of stone crosses suggests a very close relationship to carpentry. In his major publication on Northumbrian crosses Collingwood observed that from the large numbers of these crosses which obviously reproduce 'the type of wooden construction, it seems certain that there were such things in common use.... Otherwise we cannot account for the forms of which we now give a few examples, that is to say cylindrical shafts with their upper parts shaved off into four flat sides' (1927, 6). No Irish cross displays quite the same distinctive characteristics as those shown by Collingwood (1927, Figs. 12-14) but the Tall Cross at Moone, county Kildare, does have a conformation which may suggest a similar derivation: the massive pyramidal base corresponds to the trunk-like cylindrical lower shafts of the Anglo-Saxon examples, the lower shaft, uniquely in the Irish series, is almost perfectly square in section - a form which might be expected to occur if a tree-trunk were trimmed to give four flat faces. The form of the unique North Cross at Kilkieran, its shaft, over three-and-a-half metres tall and like Moone almost square in section, narrowing dramatically from butt to apex like the trunk of a pine tree, also speaks evocatively of an underlying wooden structure. As suggested for the cross at Clonca, the short armspan, here only 43cm, could have been cut from the same piece of timber as the shaft on a wooden original.</page><page sequence="32">136 DOROTHY KELLY There are details of the morphology of other crosses of the Irish and west Scottish series which also seem to reflect the influence of carpentry. The cross from Drumadonnell (Drumgooland), county Down, is one such. Like the cross at Moone it is close to square in section. It has distinctive broad flat edge-mouldings, unlike anything known to this writer from the body of contemporary metalwork, which speak of an approach originating in wood. Here perhaps is reflected a combination of wood with metal plates which might on the original have ornamented the narrow recesses between the mouldings. It is interesting that a very similar approach to the structure of the cross is found at Dromiskin, county Louth, where comparable broad flat edge-mouldings are a feature, with in this case what appears to be the representation of a metalwork plaque at the head of the cross (Henry 1965, PL 82). That the form seems to have been widespread is suggested by the remains of the small plain cross with solid ring south of the modern church at Ballymore Eustace, county Kildare (Fig. 35c), which has similar broad flat edge-mouldings bordering a central recessed panel. Discussion In the past the historical sources which indicate the existence of wooden crosses have been rehearsed, as has the evidence of forms of crosses with pointed stake-like butts represented on cross-slabs. However, attention has only rarely been directed towards the forms of the stone crosses and even in these cases has been limited to individual examples and isolated features. The possibility, indeed the probability, that the high crosses were preceded by free-standing wooden crosses has been acknowledged, therefore, but no direct relationship between the forms in both media has been argued on the evidence available from a wider, more comprehensive survey of the high crosses, combined with the evidence from other sources, such as has been undertaken here. Under these circumstances Lang's inference (1988, 4) that evidence for wooden high crosses has until recently been 'speculative supposition' is perhaps justified. The arguments presented here, based on a survey specifically directed towards an examination of the evidence presented by the high crosses, may still be regarded as to some extent speculative; the hypotheses, however, are grounded on the evidence of a wide range of distinctive features presented by a significant number of crosses in Ireland and Scotland. Henry's suggestion that the Ossory crosses 'are really processional crosses or reliquary crosses turned into stone monuments' (1965,140) seems to imply, at the larger end of the scale, models no more than 76.5cm to 1.58m high, the sizes respectively of the later Cross of Cong (Cone 1977, 214) and the Rupertus Cross (Wilson 1984, Fig. 158). The models cited are so much smaller in scale than the stone crosses that it is necessary to envisage the latter as greatly enlarged versions of these proposed prototypes. It should further be added that the extant examples of processional or reliquary crosses have nothing of the monumental characteristics of the Ossory crosses which, as Henry herself so eloquently described them, 'are no longer the outline of a cross raised against the sky. There is a sense of architecture about them and from whatever angle you consider them, they offer to the eye a complex perspective of mouldings and well-organized planes' (1940,103). The striking difference between the stone crosses and the processional crosses of the period is perhaps best appreciated at Ahenny where the base of the monumental North cross shows a figure holding aloft a slender ringed processional cross which can have been little more than a metre in length (Henry 1965, PL 83). It is suggested here that some historical and archaeological evidence, even outside the</page><page sequence="33">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 137 evidence rehearsed in the arguments put forward above, confirms the existence at this time of free-standing wooden crosses of monumental scale, that is, similar in size to the stone crosses. Bede's description of the erection of the wooden cross at Heavenfield is relevant: Oswald, in the ardour of his faith, seized the cross with both hands and held it upright while the soldiers heaped earth and stones into a hole which had been dug to take it. The details of the description, and indeed an implication that Oswald's religious fervour gave him the added strength required to support the cross, suggests that it was of some considerable size. As indicated above the boss from Wood Quay finds its best comparisons, both in ornament and size, in the bosses of the high crosses at Clogher and Tynan. These are crosses which, although damaged, can be estimated to have originally achieved heights of between 3 and 4m. It seems reasonable to suggest, in view of its relative size, that the Wood Quay boss came from a monumental wooden cross of similar scale. The Irish at this time were noted for their use of wood as a building material. Bede records that Finan, the Irish bishop of Lindisfarne from 651 to 661 AD, 'constructed a church on the island of Lindisfarne suitable for an episcopal see, building it after the Scots method, not of stone, but of hewn oak, thatching it with reeds' (HE III. 25). The description of a church in the seventh century Hisperica Famina gives an impression, however obscure, of the achievements of the builders in wood, the wooden oratory described as 'fashioned out of candle-shaped beams; it has four-fold fastenings; the square foundations of the said temple give it stability, from which springs a solid beamwork of massive enclosure; it has a vaulted roof above; square beams are placed in the ornamented roof.' (Herren 1974, 109). The description of the church at Kildare by Cogitosus in his Life of St Brigit supports this impression and give us further insight into the elaborate decoration which might have been found in such buildings, including a 'finely wrought portal' (Connolly and Picard 1987, 26), which may have been carved. Furthermore the phenomenon of the translation of the features of wooden, cruck-built churches into stone is well-attested for the period (Leask 1977, 43-7). Against such a cultural background both the construction of monumental crosses of wood with complex, sophisticated structures, and the translation of their forms into stone at a comparable scale seems more than plausible. The use of multiple pieces of timber, it is suggested, is a technique which would be required only for a monumental structure; certainly one cannot envisage that the same constraints would apply to a small cross such as a processional cross nor one which might be placed on an altar, both of which could presumably be cut from two single pieces of wood, quite modest in size, which might be joined by the simple expedient of a half-mortice joint at the crossing. The use of such a joint to construct modestly sized modern crosses of wood has been indicated here. In the absence of technical examination of the relevant material similar constructional techniques for a processional cross of the early Christian period cannot be demonstrated for Irish or Insular examples such as the Cross of Cong or the Rupertus processional cross. However two processional crosses from the Camara Santa of the Cathedral in Oviedo, in the north of Spain, the Cruz de los Angeles, dating to 808, and the Cruz de La Victoria, dating to 908, the wooden cores of which were photographed in 1942, have exactly this form of construction (Rodriguez 1972, Pis. IV, XVI). It might be argued that even a monumental wooden cross could have been constructed in exactly this way, using two pieces of timber linked by a half-mortice joint. This observation requires a certain reassessment of the evidence of St Oran's Cross at Iona where lower shaft, transom and upper shaft are separate pieces of stone linked by mortice-and-tenon joints; in wood the use of a half-mortice joint would have resulted in a</page><page sequence="34">138 DOROTHY KELLY less complex, and therefore arguably more stable construction. Since such a joint could not be effectively translated into stone it could be argued that in St Oran's cross we are looking at an adaptation forced on the stone mason by the exigencies of his material. Whether a half-mortice joint would have provided a more stable structure in a monumental wooden cross is a point which must remain moot as we have no direct evidence either to support or refute such a suggestion. There are, however, constraints other than those of a mundane nature which need to be taken into account when considering the development of these monuments; the role of the symbolic in the development of the particular form of the high crosses, for instance, has been emphasized frequently. Although this paper deals almost exclusively with the interpretation of evidence on a practical level it is the view of this writer that in the high crosses we are looking at monuments which are supreme combinations of the practical and symbolic. Behind the tangible forms of these crosses lies a wealth of less tangible ideas and meanings and in this instance one piece of historical evidence might be taken as indicating the operation of symbolic constraints on the structural details of St Oran's Cross. A significant event in the Christian world in the first half of the seventh century was the recovery of the True Cross from the Persians and its exposition in 629 in Jerusalem. Arculf, a Gaulish bishop, visited the Holy Land later in the century. He recounted his experiences to Adomn?n on Iona, which he visited after being shipwrecked on his way home, and they are recorded in Adomn?n's De Locis Sanctis, written in the 680s (Meehan 1983, 11). The work was intended as a faithful record of Arculf s experiences but, as Meehan points out, Adomn&amp;n's treatment of the story 'suggests that particular points of identification interested him, perhaps because of previous puzzlement or uncertainty' (1983,12). Before giving Arculf s description of the True Cross Adomn?n calls particular attention to it, advising his readers to take special note by prefacing it with the words 'This fact, however, should be carefully observed'. His description of the cross is then fascinating: he continues, 'There are three, not two, short beams, the transverse beam that is, and the long one which is cut into two equal parts' (Meehan 1983, 111). Adomn?n's description of the structure of the True Cross contrasts two different forms of cross: two short beams suggest an equal-armed cross, three, a short transom and a long shaft cut in two, a particular form of Latin cross with the transom cutting the shaft at its mid-height. The True Cross as described by Adomn?n, therefore, was a Latin cross composed of three pieces of wood, just as St Oran's cross is of three pieces of stone, although it may be noted that St Oran's Cross does not present the equal upper and lower shafts inferred for the True Cross. De Locis Sanctis is likely to have been widely read in ecclesiastical circles in the last years of the seventh century and the early years of the eighth; Bede, for example, quotes extensively from it in his Ecclesiastical History and tells us that 'Adomn?n presented this book to King Alfrid and through his generosity it was circulated for lesser folk to read' (HE V. 15). Nowhere is it likely to have been studied more closely than at Iona. Might the structure of St Oran's Cross there, modelled on a wooden prototype constructed perhaps not long after Arculf s visit, represent a tradition of pious imitation of the form of the True Cross as described by Arculf? This possibility should be seen in the context of evidence which suggests that fundamental changes in the view of the cross may have taken place within the Irish/west Scottish cultural province around the end of the seventh century. It is a remarkable feature of the art history of this period that on the neighbouring islands of Ireland and Britain, two parallel and broadly contemporary traditions of free-standing crosses, isolated phenomena in western Europe, should have produced monuments</page><page sequence="35">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 139 radically different in form from one another. The distinctive Latin form of the crosses of Ireland and western Scotland contrasts starkly with the crosses found in Anglo-Saxon areas of Britain, which take the form of a small equal-armed cross elevated on a stele (Kelly, forthcoming 1993). This difference is particularly puzzling in view of the evidence which allows that Oswald's act of erecting a wooden cross at Heavenfield, very possibly similar to examples he had seen on Iona, provided the potential for the growth of two closely related traditions. It may be that information reaching Irish ecclesiastical circles at the end of the seventh century, perhaps in particular Arculf s reports not only on the True Cross and the tall cross erected in the river Jordan but also the 'large cross of silver' (Meehan 1983,49) erected on Golgotha on the place where the cross of the Crucifixion had stood, was responsible for changes in the view of the cross which influenced the forms of monumental wooden crosses, later to be copied in stone (Kelly 1990,192-200). Such a view would allow us to explain not only the essential form of the Irish and west Scottish high crosses but also the striking difference between these and crosses found in Anglo-Saxon areas. It is in the context of such an explanation that the view of the form of St Oran's cross as a possible imitation of that of the True Cross is offered. Four groups of interrelated crosses have been discussed above. From the evidence of these four groups two major approaches to the construction of wooden crosses may be argued. The crosses of Group 3, at Iona, Rothesay and Kilnaruane, are the most straightforward in their basic structure as analysed. They are furthermore the most readily recognised as derived from wooden prototypes because the techniques used in the original wooden construction were such that it was possible to translate the prototype structure directly into stone without significant alteration. This group of crosses can be argued to have preserved faithfully the original form of wooden crosses built of sturdy timbers, the basic elements of the cross, upper and lower shafts and transom, composed of three individual blocks of wood linked by mortice-and-tenon joints. Most closely related to one another are the crosses of Groups 1, 2 and 4, exemplified by the crosses at Kilbroney, Toureen Peakaun and Ahenny. Each of these groups reflects in its form the same approach to the basic composition of the cross: a central structure flanked on each broad face by vertical units, the structure clamped together using rivets or dowels on the body of the cross and probably also solid containing units at butt and apex such as are suggested for the Ahenny group. The basic structures of these crosses may seem initially radically different from those of Group 3. However, the consideration of the constraints of using wood undertaken above and the implications this has for the construction of the transom, that is the necessity to use a separate piece of wood where a transom with a wide span is required, suggests that for some of the crosses of these groups also a separately cut transom might have been necessary. Thus it was suggested in the analysis of the Ossory group of crosses (page 132 above, Fig.43A) that in constructing the internal component of the cross more than a single elements may have been necessary, a shaft and transom linked by a half-mortice joint, or upper and lower shafts and a transom linked by mortice-and-tenon joints. In other words one should allow that the apparently more complex structures reflected in the crosses of Groups 1, 2 and 4 could have had at their core a construction similar to that of the crosses represented at Iona. Extant examples of crosses of this Iona type are very few in number. Their distribution, principally in western Scotland with a single outlier at Kilnaruane, is limited. The crosses of the other groups, closely related to one another, comprise a much larger number and have a widespread distribution in Ireland, also appearing in Scotland (Fig. 44).</page><page sequence="36">140 DOROTHY KELLY A'CHILlTcTX ^ S 0 L GROUP 1 ~^S J GROUP 2 r^ cT^Cy/i ? ??^,.? ? lONAy^ &gt; A group 3 ifr^y^ y% 0 GROUP 4 .J^kilmartin ?/( J ^ata^bertJ fy &gt; C% J*Tl-&gt;, y \^ | #DRUMADONNELL y?

The prototype form which gave rise to the crosses of the other groups, however, might be argued to have gained widespread acceptance, producing a number of variations on the basic form. The hypothesized relationship between the two major approaches to construction raises the possibility that they may themselves be variations on a single theme. The apparently more widespread popularity of the approach represented at Ahenny, Toureen Peakaun and Kilbroney might be explained in terms of features of their design which would have given stability to the wooden prototype crosses. 6 RJorddin's thesis of the development of the ringed cross, which argued that the ring was in part a response to problems of firmly attaching the transom to the shaft of the cross, has received some adverse comment over the years (Lamont 1968,10, referred to by Richardson 1984,129). The question of the origin of the ring is not addressed here but O Rlordiin's supposition that the basic structure of the cross - with shaft and transom morticed together - would have required additional support is relevant to a discussion of wooden crosses of monumental scale. While we might accept Lamont's view that a skilled carpenter would not create a joint which required additional strengthening, it might also be recognised that his statement appears not to take into account the possibility that these crosses were monumental structures, nor the range of environments in which they may have stood, the consequent cumulative effects particularly of strong winds on the structures of crosses standing in open exposed environments, or the possible design adaptations which might have been deemed necessary, based on experience of these effects, by carpenters involved in the construction of such crosses. To take a particular case in point one might try to envisage the long-term effects of gusting winds on a multi-piece cross incorporating a transom with a very wide span; a wide transom is a feature of many crosses of the Irish and west Scottish series, and therefore presumably of their prototypes, but it reaches extreme proportions on St John's Cross, Iona, where the width of the transom is over 2m. On a cross like St John's, under the conditions envisaged, the mortice-and-tenon joints between transom and shaft, particularly transom and lower shaft, would have been subjected to great stress. One method of counteracting the effects on a wooden cross would be to apply plates of wood on each broad face which, by overlapping the joints, would minimise movement, effectively locking the three elements of the cross more firmly together. If these plates were large enough the resulting structure would resemble that envisaged for the prototype crosses of the Ossory series (Fig. 43A). It might be noted in passing that the addition of a ring would, to an extent, provide some alleviation of the type of problems envisaged above by restricting movement of the transom. In terms of monumental wooden crosses erected in the open 6 Riord&amp;in's view of the practical application of the ring is by no means unacceptable. In the distinctive features of the Ossory crosses Henry recognised a relationship to metal forms. The assessment of the complex forms of these crosses undertaken here suggests that these may be more precisely recognised as based on composite wooden crosses ornamented with plates of metal, the wooden cross at the core playing a significant role in the morphology which was translated into stone. This theory has the advantage that it can offer an explanation of the many unusual characteristics of these Ossory crosses, something which cannot be provided by the more limited theory which recognised only their dependence on metalwork forms. In view of the acknowledged metalwork affinities of the Ossory crosses one is obliged to ask whether others of the crosses discussed here</page><page sequence="38">142 DOROTHY KELLY might represent the same phenomenon. De Paor, for example, has stated that St John's Cross 'is the most thoroughgoing example of a great wooden construction sheeted with metal and elaborately ornamented, all translated into stone'(1987, 149). The crosses at Iona, however, while drawing on metalwork for their repertoire of ornament, have none of the characteristics of the Ossory Crosses, such as hachured edge-mouldings or bosses, which would indicate direct copying of metal-plated crosses (RCAHMS 1982, 18). Nor do the shafts at Rothesay and Kilnaruane have features which might suggest that they are modelled directly on metal-plated crosses, although certain panels on each, such as the horseman on the Rothesay shaft and the Orans figure on the Kilnaruane shaft (Fig. 38a,d), have characteristics, in particular the placing of the figures so that numerous points come into contact with each side of the frame of the panel (Kelly 1991,204-5), which may suggest that these individual panels are modelled after metalwork plaques. The very slender nature of the western upright element of the cross at Kilbroney relative to the central and eastern elements, and its entirely geometric ornament, might suggest that here we are looking back at a structure consisting of two upright timber elements with metal sheeting applied to one face. However, the ornamenting of the recessed hollowed angles, on a different plane to the surface of the cross, is curious in this context. Furthermore the cross displays none of the characteristic features of form such as bosses or edge-mouldings which would support a suggestion that it was modelled on a metalwork prototype. There is no ambiguity in the form of the cross at Toureen Peakaun, whose affinities are entirely with wood with no evidence which might suggest a reliance on metalwork. Its counterpart on Canna, so remarkably similar in the dimensions of its shaft, has one face, again the thinner of the flanking elements, given over to mainly geometric ornament in very flat relief which might suggest metalwork influences. This, however, is more than balanced by the ornament in extremely high relief on the opposite face which speaks strongly of wood-carving. On balance therefore it seems that, while some borrowing from metalwork may be present, the crosses discussed here are unlikely to have been modelled on prototypes which comprised of wooden structures covered with metal plates, with the exception of the crosses of the Ossory Group. Finally, it is noteworthy that the crosses which present this evidence of a dependence on wooden prototypes include many of those which traditionally have been regarded as lying early in the Irish and west Scottish series. The most recent detailed research on the early crosses of Iona, looking to parallels for their ornament in contemporary metalwork, manuscripts and related sculpture, favours a date in the middle or second half of the eighth century for their construction (RCHAMS 1982,18). While widely differing dates have been suggested for the crosses of the Ahenny group, most authorities have preferred an eighth century date (Henry 1965, 141; Roe 1962, 8-9), some allowing the possibility of an early ninth century date (Edwards 1983,32; Richardson and Scarry 1990,17). Potentially the best possibility of attributing a date-range to the crosses of Group 2 lies in the inscription on the west face of the cross at Toureen Peakaun. It may be that the use of methods such as those employed by the late Domhnall 6 Murchadha (1980,47-8) will produce a definitive reading. In the meantime it is clear from careful examination of the inscription and photographs taken in good light that at least some of the inscription is in a display script such as is found on the Ardagh chalice and the Lindisfarne Gospels. This allows a suggestion that this cross is also likely to date to the eighth, possibly early eighth, century. It seems unlikely that the other crosses of these three groups, closely related as they are in form, would be of dates too far removed from those proposed for individual members of the groups. The crosses of Group 1, exemplified by the cross at Kilbroney, displaying a structure which is very similar in concept</page><page sequence="39">MODELS FOR IRISH HIGH CROSSES 143 to that of the crosses of Groups 2 and 4, may also belong to the same period, and indeed a date before 800 has been implied for the Kilbroney cross in the past (Henry 1965, Map p. 137). On the basis of the evidence discussed here it may be proposed that the forms of the crosses included in this study probably evolved in wood in the period from the late seventh century and were translated from wood into stone from the eighth to the early ninth century. Indeed one might suggest that logically, if one accepts a direct connection between the forms of crosses in wood and stone, the stone crosses which might be expected to preserve the best evidence of such a relationship should be the earliest, since from the end of the ninth century high crosses achieved a new independence from traditional models. It can be argued that this phenomenon has already been documented by research which studied the influence of metalwork on the stone crosses. While the earlier crosses such as those of the Ossory Group could be shown by Henry to be heavily dependent on contemporary metalwork for their ornament as well as some features of their form, the application of this idea to a wider body of crosses led to the identification of only a few isolated details on crosses of the late ninth/early tenth century which might reflect the imitation of metalwork (Harbison 1977, 283). The dating evidence reviewed here for crosses imitating wooden prototypes seems to reflect a similar situation, these apparently lying early in the series, the body of later crosses showing little or no evidence of continuing dependence on wooden models. The evidence of the morphology of the stone crosses as interpreted here supports the more tentative evidence of the written sources in suggesting a widespread tradition of free-standing wooden crosses in Ireland and Scotland. These appear to have been current from at least the first half of the seventh century and, in response to a variety of influences, to have evolved into the forms reflected in the stone crosses by the end of that century. This evidence sets in context statements which suggest the necessity of an external impulse in the development of the high cross tradition in Ireland and western Scotland (Edwards 1983, 407; RCAHMS 1982, 17). If one were to accept as a necessary ingredient for the inception of this tradition the importation of specific skills, or craftsmen trained in those skills, it nevertheless seems clear that, in the first instance, these merely effected the translation of the forms of an already long-standing tradition in wood into a new medium, stone.
