<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Criticism against Itself In the boom industry of Milton scholarship, where it is increasingly difficult to "keep up with the literature" and enjoy any of the other plea sures of this fallen world, Catherine Belsey s short book John Milton: Language, Gender, Power (Oxford and New York: Basil Blackwell, 1988; 114 pp.; $35.00) promises to be a useful primer on postmodernist approaches to Milton. Integrat ing strategies from deconstruction, new histori cism, feminism, and Lacanian psychoanalytic crit icism, Belsey produces a text about Milton "as a moment in English textual history" (5) in which the features of modern individual subjectivity, and the institutional and ideological controls which determine it, begin to emerge. This book is readable, largely lucid and accessible, and its close attention to Milton's major texts provides several local insights and satisfactions. The book is instructive, but not always in the ways it pro poses to be. Belsey's effort to expose the crises and contradictions of "Milton" as an authorita tive humanist text ends up revealing the vulnera bility of her own interpretation to the same sorts of veiled contradictions which she discerns in her subject. Belsey might characterize her position as "post humanist," for Milton's text as an unstable product of the contradictions that constitute "humanism" is the object of her interrogation. "Humanism" is a problematic and open-ended category, but for someone committed to historical specificity, Belsey deploys the term with a kind of casual abandon. Sometimes "humanism" seems to refer to the classically-inspired literary spirit of the Renaissance which she claims is linked with, and therefore complicit in, the consolidation of modern centrist state power and colonial expan sionism. Elsewhere she links the term to post Cartesian subjectivity and the formation of En lightenment concepts of universal and verifiable truth, order, and reason. Still elsewhere it seems to refer to general concerns which the critic herself shares in the contention over meaning: "what is the place of human beings in the world in history? and what, beyond all history and all locality, does it mean to be human?" (18). These questions, of urgent concern to the author her self, are hardly the privileged domain of the pre and post-enlightenment European male bourgeoi sie, and we might wonder what would be the shape and nature of a culture that never asked or ceased to ask them. Thus Belsey establishes "hu manism" as a straw man; readers familiar with new historicist approaches will not be surprised to discover that Milton's liberal humanism isn't as tolerant or progressive as it seems. Invoking God to authorize its truths and certify its mean ings, "Truth is a despotism. It enlists subjects in obedience to an authority which needs no other justification" (84). Humanist "truth" not only shores up systems of power in the early modern patriarchal family and in the emerging nation state, but justifies various ventures in colonial expansionism, which sought to eliminate cultural differences in the name of those universal human truths that Europeans understood themselves privileged to bear to and impose upon the rest of the world (35). Yet deconstruction can always locate the sup pressed points of instability, the slippage of the signifier, in any system of meanings which pre tends to be privileged. This slippage inevitably produces meanings that an author, or the meta physical authority invoked by that author, can't control. Even Paradise Lost, the master narrative</page><page sequence="2">of Protestant humanism, "cannot inscribe the Logos, because the inscription is always also a re inscription, at one remove from the imagined plenitude of originary presence" (41). Milton's God, whose Word alone Milton invokes to vali date the truth of the text, is himself not the au thor but the effect of textuality, a mirage pro duced by the signifying process. The Fall, then, in Belsey's account, recurs in every Milton poem as a fall from univocal and authoritative truth into interpretive contention. That fall into interpretive struggle is fortunate, because it marks the emer gence of human subjectivity, with its limited but nevertheless authentic prospects for the making of a human meaning. The text becomes, in a sense, a tree of knowledge, "a site of struggle, a place to lay claim to the possibilities we want to realize" (104). Consequently, Milton's textual practices create metaphysical and political slippage at the very sites where he seems most ideologically assertive. In Samson Agonistes and Paradise Lost, Belsey argues that Milton wishes, but fails, to cement in place a gender hierarchy which defends men against the sexual power of women. Belsey's ap parently casual acceptance of the Parker chronol ogy, reproduced in the Carey and Fowler edition of the poems, which locates Samson in the 1647 53 period, supports her reading of the sexual pol itics in these poems: "At the heart of Samson Agonistes is an account of marriage as a struggle for power, in which men dare not relax their vigi lance for an instant, in case they lose control not so much of women but of themselves" (57). By disclosing a bitter and insecure misogyny "at the heart" of Milton's tragedy, Belsey casts the drama as a dark prefiguration of the marriage theme in Paradise Lost, and predisposes the reader to take her at her word that "No feminist in her senses would try to find anything cheerful to say about Milton's myth of male oppression divinely or dained" (59). Nevertheless, Paradise Lost "magnificently fails to fix the meaning of sexual difference, whether in absolutist or in humanist terms, and so the poem uncovers what it cannot explicitly acknowl edge, the precariousness which is an inevitable ef MILTON QUARTERLY 87 feet of power" (64). Belsey asserts that even be fore the Fall, love in Eden is not a condition of erotic and intellectual pleasure and mutual en richment, but "a power struggle in which both partners keep Adam under perpetual surveil lance, continually examining him for signs of weakness" (65). Eve's sexuality, like Dalila's, is a threat, the site of instability where the cultural meaning of sex emerges, where gender becomes defined by a system of power that uneasily guar antees male protection from that sexuality and the potentially destabilizing desire it evokes. The various attempts of male speakers—Adam, Rapha el, the poet, God—to constrain Eve within the gender system of Eden ultimately call attention to the provisionality and precariousness of that sys tem, and thus call it into question. Only in Mil ton's heaven can Belsey discern what Blake would call "the lineaments of gratified desire," a sexual Utopia of polymorphous freedom, of "sexual plu rality for each individual, and the consequent re lease of sexual being from power" (67). Belsey's vision of sexual liberation is no less tied than Mil ton's to ideology and social practice, although it seems disingenuous for her to imply that the sex ual politics of contemporary culture are any less tied to the exercise of power and the threat of domination than those of the Puritan marriage upon which Milton bases his representation of Adam and Eve. Belsey's reading of Paradise Lost is a curiously slippery instance of intertextual criticism. Her as sertion of Milton's self-evident antifeminism seems to derive from Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagina tion (1979), whom Belsey cites as if that book's problematic polemic against Milton were the final word on his understanding of gender. Bel sey adopts another element of Gilbert and Gubar's argument by approaching Paradise Lost indirecdy through Robert Graves's Wife to Mr. Milton. Gilbert and Gubar's deployment of the antagonistic Graves as a biographical source for their misrepresentation of Milton is perverse, yet Belsey's refraction of Paradise Lost through Graves's fiction compounds the problem of criti</page><page sequence="3">88 MILTON QUARTERLY cal irresponsibility. Belsey's substantial synopsis of Graves's novel, a first-person narrative by Milton's first wife Marie Powell, quietly leaves the biographical aspersions in place, for it is the only thing resembling a portrait of the historical Mil ton that Belsey provides us. Furthermore, Belsey grants Graves's novel a privileged interpretive status by claiming that it is "in a sense a reading of Milton's text" (59) that may "offer a more illuminating reading ... than a criticism which, demanding the message, represses or denies the textuality and so misses the (sliding) meanings" (63). This means in particular that there is more to be learned about Paradise Lost from a reading of Graves's novel than from Graves's strident essays. But the generalized reference to the ob tuseness of message-ridden criticism serves to legitimate Belsey's decision to ignore any of the scholarship of the last two decades by critics such as McColley, Lewalski, Wittreich, Gallagher, or Smith, which would complicate her account of an antifeminist Milton. Belsey thus selectively em ploys deconstructive and intertextual strategies to elaborate a surprisingly "essentialist" position demonstrating Milton's unquestionable misogyny. If Belsey's feminist account of Samson Agonistes and Paradise Lost is disappointingly predictable, her reading of narratological strategies in Para dise Regained serves to reinforce rather than re place insights of traditional criticism, and found ers on the very condition of the poem's textuality that she is eager to exploit. She is not the first to recognize that the poem's dramatic climax on the pinnacle of the temple is an interpretive climax. When Jesus recites "Tempt not the Lord thy God," Paradise Regained "quotes the New Testa ment, which in turn quotes the Old Testament (Matthew iv,7; Luke iv,12; Deuteronomy vi,16), and each reinscription produces a difference which, however marginally, problematizes its meaning" (102). Belsey concludes, "The meaning of the incarnation is undecidable. But there is no meaning, and in consequence no undecidability, without language" (104). There is a kind of por tentous ring in such rhetoric, but I am not quite sure what this statement, and others like it, means; or rather, since its meaning, like Milton's, must be "undecidable," why it matters. If Mil ton's concern as author is to "repress the textual ity" of his own fictional text, having Jesus quote Scripture is hardly the most effective strategy. The doctrine of the Incarnation enacted in Para dise Regained seems to be particularly unsetding to Belsey, perhaps because incarnation resists the very doctrine of differance which informs her argument. If Jesus is both God and man, if Mil ton's text claims to be both explicitly fictional and historically valid, the seam which should open the text to deconstructive reading never quite discloses itself and thus leaves the critic struggling to align the text to an argument that ends up circling around the obvious or the irrele vant. One of the problems of a deconstructive tactic, even when practiced by a critic as alert as Belsey, is that it doesn't evade thematics, it reori ents thematics toward a set of fairly predictable themes, and thus it reduces all texts to the same patterns of differance, repression, and disclosure of textuality. Her conclusions about Paradise Regained will read much the same as conclusions that might be reached about a poem by Edward Taylor, a Zora Neale Hurston novel, a New York Times op-ed piece, or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Deconstructing a "logocentric" theology, it rein states theological concern in the romance of language's endless creativity. It is not surprising that the strongest analysis in Belsey's book involves her treatment of the Satan of Paradise Lost. On Satan's political revolt against the despotism of heaven the critic can project her epistemological resistance to Milton's humanism. Making the negative choice of disobe dience, Satan is an agent for the generation of difference and the exemplary split subject of humanist modernism, in whom "subjectivity itself begins to disintegrate" (75). Belsey's account of Milton's God in the same terms, however, is not quite persuasive. Lacan, whose psychoanalytic theory might be considered crypto-theology, would acknowledge the impossibility of scrutiniz ing the figure or site in the signifying system where what he calls "the name of the Father" is spoken, because a human or anthropomorphic subject is not to be found there; but for Belsey</page><page sequence="4">this seems unimaginable. Thus her analysis of God's alienation by and through desire, at the moment that he creates difference, is tempting: "Paradise is always already lost, even to God" (70). But it doesn't seem to square with the evi dence of the poem. Perhaps the "undecidable" critical debate over the character of Milton's God is itself an index of the degree to which Milton's representation of God exceeds the characterolog ical assumptions that underwrite Belsey's analysis. The politics of reading is a major issue of new historicist criticism, whose arguments with and about the past have a strange urgency and a kind of Utopian hope thai the transformation of our understanding of the text of the past will free us for the inscription of the future. But Belsey's cri tique of Milton's humanism, like many other new historicist accounts, appears to be a historically displaced version of an argument with herself. Belsey herself might acknowledge this, since she invokes Shoshana Felman's insight that "the crit ical reading also unconsciously repeats what it de nounces in the text" (62). Belsey's critique of what she discerns as Milton's authoritarianism contains a strong plea for intellectual and social tolerance that Milton seems already to have en visioned in Areopagitica: Is it possible in the twentieth century, as both the cultural relativity of humanism and the metaphysics of logocentrism become ap parent, to glimpse a third option: that we might share the work of producing mean ings—which are explicitly differed, plural, not anchored in a metaphysical tyranny, not an attempt to recover an ever-receding pres ence, not absolute—but meanings, neverthe less, by which to live? (45) There is a poignancy to the rhetorical question that both veils and signals Belsey's anxiety that she may be articulating, in contemporary and somewhat vaguer terms, a position of liberal tol erance which Milton has already articulated more powerfully. I leave it for other readers to assess whether Milton, who counted the cost as well as the responsibility of ideological contention as the only way to discriminate the truthfully compel MILTON QUARTERLY 89 ling from the speciously attractive, is more radi cal than his radical critics within the Anglo-Amer ican liberal academy. Belsey's book does not persuade me that Milton's representation of the ethical and political challenges attendant on human freedom and responsibility has yet been reduced to history by critics eager to conceive the outlines of a postmodern culture.
