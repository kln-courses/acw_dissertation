<plain_text><page sequence="1">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? A REVIEW ARTICLE' Theresa Howard-Carter Kuwait National Museum and The University Museum The subject of Dilmun has, in the last decade, attained a position of considerable prominence in Near Eastern Studies. In addition to long- known literary references to Dilmun, an increasing amount of textual material is now available in new treatments and translations. Moreover, active programs of excavation in the Gulf area for more than twenty years have resulted in great accumulations of archaeological data, for the most part as yet unassimilated. The information presently available covers a great number of periods and types of sources not readily accessible to the general Near Eastern scholar. The occasion of this review article of Dilmun: New Studies in the Archaeology and Early History of Bahrain, therefore presents a fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the essentials of a rapidly swelling body of data. Initially, this article will discuss the volume under review and the various contributions contained therein, commenting in detail where appropriate on points raised by the individual authors. Certain materials not con- sidered in the Dilmun volume will be treated in "Additional Notes." A concluding digest lists all of the real evidence, arranged chronologically. The digest draws not only on published information but also on data that is still under study. In the compilation of this data a host of generous colleagues freely and graciously contributed their expert knowledge. For example, a number of scholars, acting as consultants for the Kuwait National Museum, are currently in the process of preparing the Failaka material for comprehensive exhibition. The Failaka material complements rather than supplements the Bahrain material; it contains a much larger corpus of both glyptic and inscriptional evidence, as well as a number of fragments of figured soft-stone vessels. Thus the consultants' observations will be introduced throughout this article where documentation is rele- vant, especially in the concluding digest. 1. Berliner Beitrlige zum Vorderen Orient 2 (ed.

Piesinger's dissertation "The Legacy of Dilmun: The Roots of Maritime Trade in Eastern Coastal Arabia in the 4th/3rd Millennium."2 However it did prove possible to include some of the most pertinent information from this work in the Digest, since it is totally necessary for any material evaluation of Dilmun in the early and middle third millennium. The work under review collects in a single volume essays and comments by scholars chiefly from western and central Europe who have at some point concerned themselves with the topic of "Dilmun," particularly in reference to the islands of Bahrain. The conception is a splendid one, but what appears in several respects to have been a hurried effort renders this work less valuable than it should have been. One might in the first instance have hoped for a broader base of authorship. Secondly, a comprehensive introduction could have outlined usefully the problem areas and could have defined a framework within which the contributing scholars could have operated more effectively. However, the work was intended as a presentation volume on the occasion of the Bahrain monarchy's 200th anniversary; thus materials from Eastern Arabia and Failaka usually included in a consideration of "Greater Dilmun"3 were largely excluded from this volume.4 Other available textual materials would have usefully augmented the rather scant information provided for some periods. Despite the title of the volume, archaeology is largely neglected. Some attempt has been made here to remedy that particular defect. The book would more appropriately have been entitled "Dilmun in Bahrain." The title is inexact in another aspect as well. Since Potts labeled it "Dilmun," we might conjecture that Potts intended to abandon the subject at the point in history when that term fell out of use in the Hellenistic period, and Bahrain became known as Tylos (and Failaka as Ikaros). Yet Kessler's Neo-Babylonians are followed by Frye's Sasanians, and finally Beaucamp and Robin's Nestorian Christians in Bahrain. The sources available for the time span not covered in the volume under review, from the late first millennium B.C. through the early first millennium A.D., have in the last several years been enriched by newly discovered material.

The Indices are well- prepared, but one laments both there and in the text the fact that non- standard characters and diacritical marks are handwritten rather than set in type. All in all the book brings us some valuable new information and some useful critical studies. More time, careful editing, attention to detail, and comprehensive structuring could have resulted in a first-class work. Critical reviews Curtis E. Larsen, "The Early Environment and Hydrology of Ancient Bahrain" (pp. 3-34). Larsen presents us with a large amount of interesting material, both old and new. He gives a good description of geological domes and the nature of the orogenic activity which moved the Arabian Peninsula against southwest Asia. Larsen depends heavily on information from raised beaches to establish the rise and fall of sea levels; there is apparently no means to determine a standard rate for these fluctuations without knowledge of the factors obtaining at the time. Larsen includes a very pertinent hydrological discussion regarding the sea water penetration of aquifers. (This penetration, lamentably, is demonstrable in the modern death of palm groves.) He cogently points out the importance in antiquity of the relationship of artesian springs to settlement patterns and suggests that springs form the core of the ancient settlement pattern with Qala'at al-Bahrain on its northern fringe: "It is tempting to see the initial development of this urban center from an existing concentration of spring- oriented villages during the late 3rd millennium when the center of Dilmun shifted from the Arabian coast to the island of Bahrain" (p. 15). This somewhat startling statement is presented without further explanation and 5.

The same dissertation must also have provided the information in Larsen's Early Dilmun discussion (pp. 16-17), which is tantalizing in references to third millennium tombs and to stratified village sites in the Abquaiq area on the east coast of Arabia that contained imported pottery from Early Dynastic Mesopotamia. The maximum expansion of Dilmun culture on Bahrain cited by Larsen as occurring at 2000-1800 B.C. correlates well with recent evidence from excavations on Failaka.8 Throughout the contribution the reader is distracted by Larsen's method of citing dates; he consistently cites them in reverse, that is, the latest chronologically appears first. He then introduces a further confusion by using B.P. until historical times, when he sometimes shifts to B.C. The innate difficulties of intermingling B.P. and B.C. dates really come to a head on page 16; both there and on pp. 11f. Larsen insists on a lack of archaeological material from the fourth millennium; yet on page 16 he gives us a Carbon-14 date of "5200-5800 B.P." for the Ubaid 4 period site at al-Markh, and states it is ".... dated to the late fourth and early fifth millennia B.C." Larsen's date converts to 3800-3200 B.C., clearly in the fourth millennium. Perhaps this is niggling, but careful editing might have solved such problems. Michael Roaf, the excavator of al-Markh, explains9 that the small fish midden consisted of two phases. The earlier, dated 3800 B.C. by pottery of the late Ubaid style, had an economy based on fishing--medium-size and shellfish. The later economy was based on large fish, dugong hunting, and goat-herding; only eight sherds were associated with that phase, and thus a terminal date is very uncertain. It seems not clearly established that the occupation was continuous. Larsen's geological and paleoclimatic discussion is based principally on data from South Arabia, the East Arabian coast, and Bahrain.

The Holocene climate divides into a wet sub-pluvial (7,000-4,000 B.C.) and a hyper-arid (4,000 B.C. to present). Playa development begins at 34,000 B.C., continuing until 7,000 B.C.; these shallow warm fresh water lakes, inhabited by fresh water mollusks, were surrounded by savannah popula- ted with Bos primigenius, Bubalus Bubalus sp., and Hippopotamus. The sub-pluvial phase (7,000-4,000 B.C.) marked the appearance of better lakes and pre-ceramic Neolithic hunters using flint tools. 10. "Ar Rubc al Khali," Quaternary Period in Saudi Arabia (ed.

Englund presents us with some fascinating bits of evidence for a glimpse of Dilmun in the Uruk period as reflected in the archaic texts from Warka. Unfortunately he neglects to subject this exciting raw material to any interpretation, thereby missing an opportunity to emphasize that by the Uruk 4 period Dilmun is a very real place, inhabited by very real people who deal in very real commodities. Hans Nissen in his paper at the Bahrain Through the Ages Conference (December 1983) cited the same tablets in the same order, summarizing that the term Dilmun was used in a geographical sense, and that contacts with Uruk beyond casual trade also existed. Englund elected not to refer to some occurrences of the same lexical texts duplicated at Ebla, Fara, and Abu Salabikh; in addition he might also have used the Archaic Ur texts to expand our knowledge of the period. These archaic tablets contain very critical material and are worthy of further explication. A reorganized presentation of this material could produce the following cultural picture": A. Proper Names 1. An administrative tablet from Warka dating to the Uruk 3 period identifies a person as erim Dilmun suba, possibly the leader of a troop who receives garments, textiles, and fabrics. (Note that "troop" used in such a context is not necessarily military, but may refer to an organized group of laborers.) 2. Another administrative tablet from Warka recording the distribution of rugs, carpets, and mats refers to the receiver as gibil-nun-Dilmun. (This is the tablet W. 20274, in which Englund notes mention of the "Festival of Inanna.") 3. A huge (17.5x18 cm.) administrative tablet from Warka contains lists in six columns of people who receive very small rations of foodstuffs. The recipients are identified by personal names, titles, or city names. In the defined area which concerns us six persons receive small quantities of fish and cream or beer. M. W. Green reads these names as follows: 11. I most gratefully acknowledge the continuing assistance of Dr. Margaret W. Green, who has translated and interpreted the raw data from her files of archaic texts and extracted meaningful material, a portion of which is now published; cf. her "Early Sumerian Tax Collectors," JCS 36 (1984) 93-95.</page><page sequence="7">60 THERESA HOWARD-CARTER 1. broken 2. bi-x-x-Dilmun 3. name-da (=ruler) 4. x-dim 5. 'a-'u (?) 6. - - gi (broken) For the name in line 2, Englund, who calls this a grain disbursement text, reads nun-e-bi-Dilmun; he states it also occurs in textile accounts. 4. An archaic-period text from Ur contains four personal names incorporating the word Dilmun, such as dumu-Dilmun = "son of Dilmun." 5. The Dilmun sign occurs also in the Fara texts where we find a personal name to which Dilmun is appended, probably indicating the person is a native of Dilmun. B. Commodities related to Dilmun (recorded, exchanged, distributed) 1. A list of metals from the Uruk 3 period (3200-3000 B.C.) cited by Englund includes the following items: big axe, axe for two hands, axe for one hand, and "Dilmun axe." This list is duplicated in the Early Dynastic period in the archives of Fara, Ebla, and probably Abu Salabikh. Nissen called attention to the exchange of metal (specifically copper) in his paper at the Bahrain Conference. 2. Garments and textiles (including wool, rugs, carpets, and mats) are mentioned in several administrative tablets. C. Geography/Place These texts provide us with further clues as to the possible location of the earliest Dilmun. Of particular interest is a text from a geographical list of the Uruk 3 period, cited by Englund, in which Zabalam ?kur-Dilmun, can be read; M. W. Green has now also identified Kish. Finally, the Early Dynastic Lu A list of titles and professions, which was compiled in the Uruk 4 period, used in the Uruk 3 period and expanded in the Early Dynastic period, concerned the enku or tax collector. This list includes the following titles as translated by M. W. Green'2: chief tax collector, harvest tax collector, Dilmun tax collector, (other geographical names), Tigris tax collector. Thus we find Dilmun mentioned in a geographical list together with towns located in Sumer and in a tax collector's list along with borderlands 12. JCS 36 (1984) 93-95.</page><page sequence="8">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 61 and the Tigris. We find people with Dilmun in their personal names who possibly are among troops or working levies, but always are issued such small rations that clearly they are living in the neighborhood. This new evidence from the tablets of the Uruk 4, Uruk 3, and Early Dynastic periods can be said to reinforce the thesis advanced by this reviewer at the 1980 Rencontre Assyriologique'3 that the earliest Dilmun of the fifth, fourth, and early third millennia, as described in the myths, must be located much closer to the cities of Mesopotamia than was the later Dilmun for which we have actual physical remains. That argument was based on a reasoned analysis of the geological and archaeological evidence. In the historic period no validated imports from Mesopotamia are known in either Bahrain or Kuwait between the Ubaid period and the middle of the third millennium. Thus the suggestion that the original Dilmun was situated at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates to the east of Sumer in the region of modern Qurna stands as a reasonable conjecture. Bendt Alster,"Dilmun, Bahrain, and the Alleged Paradise in Sumerian Myth and Literature" (pp. 39-74). To review Alster's lengthy and ambitious essay is a formidable task. In his treatment of Dilmun as a concept and a reality in the Sumerian literary tradition, Alster has assembled material from many disciplines. In his first section he deals with "The identification of Dilmun," gliding swiftly through such assorted topics as trade, archaeology, and geography. The second section, "The alleged Paradise in Sumerian Myth and Literature" is really the heart of Alster's essay. In it he questions the nature of the Sumerian paradise and whether the concept of a good land and happy life is applicable to the beginning of life as imagined in the myths, and whether Sumerians in fact believed in a paradisiacal afterlife. Initially one wishes for a definition of terms; for example, what does Alster regard as Sumerian literature in this context? Does the fact that we can reconstruct a certain amount of history and specific culture of the Bronze Age from economic tablets or lexical lists make them Sumerian literature per se? Throughout his 26-page essay Alster seems never able to separate the heroic myths from reality; for example, solid information from economic documents is interspersed with liberal interpretations of the epics. In other areas where his expertise possibly does not extend, he depends heavily on secondary sources, not always analyzed with a critical 13. JCS 33 (1981) 210-23.</page><page sequence="9">62 THERESA HOWARD-CARTER eye. Some rather astonishing statements caused this reviewer to check a number of his footnotes in detail. In several cases the references did not seem to support Alster's thesis at all. For example, on the first page Alster attempts to locate "the Dilmun of the Sumerian and Akkadian texts . . . "; one would assume he was concerned with the Dilmun of the late third and second millennia. He states: "The northern side of the Arabian Gulf must now be considered excluded"; that is, as a possible location for Dilmun at any time. He footnotes this statement with the following: 1. E. Weidner, AfO 15 (1945-51) 169-70, a discussion of a baffling Neo-Assyrian inscription of Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.) which was copied from an unknown original; the text lacks any chronological or geographical precision. It reads: "I robbed Basu, a district whose city is distant; I imposed tribute as my rule over Qana, king of Tilmun." Weidner, having examined the suggestions of all travellers and scholars as to the location of Bazu,'4 reasoned that ". . Tilmun was the southeast neighbor of Bazu; it is also certain to be identified with Bahrain ... and to the near northeast Arabian coast." 2. D. J. Wiseman, Iraq 18 (1956) 128. Wiseman deals with another Neo-Assyrian inscription, dated to Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 B.C.), which mentions (mit) bazu. This fragmentary text ". . . seems to support the view that there were two places bearing this appellation." One is the Northeast Arabian desert and the other the region from northeastern Syria to Urartu; the latter is referred to in the time of Adad-nirari II (911-891 B.C.). 3. R. Borger, Asarhaddon, AfO Beiheft 9 (1956) 86:4-5, a simple transcription and translation of the inscription discussed by Weidner. 4. P. B. Cornwall, JCS 6 (1952) 137-45. Cornwall published two letters from Nippur, dating to the reign of Burnaburiash II (1375-1347 B.C.). They are addressed to Ililiya, probably the governor of Nippur, by a certain Ilippashra. The salutation of each letter reads "May Inzag and Meskilak, the gods of Tilmun, guard thy life!" Goetze, who translated the letters, noted that the construction was "good Kassite"; this fact, together with "brotherly" greetings and the archaeological evidence now at our disposal, makes it likely that Ilippashra was a Mesopotamian official resident in Dilmun. Among other affairs mentioned, both letters attest to the violence of the Ahlamu, as they raided the towns and plundered the dates in the area where the writer is located. 14. Listed by Th. Bauer, ZA 42 (1934) 182-84.</page><page sequence="10">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 63 Cornwall's article, introducing his own personal knowledge of geo- graphy, archaeology, and population is highly stimulating and well- reasoned, especially considering that it was written in 1952 before the Danish diggings in the Gulf had commenced. Not surprisingly however, information collected in the last three decades has rendered certain passages invalid. For example, we now know that Kassites were present in both Failaka and Bahrain in the fourteenth century B.C. Their contact with the nomads is scarcely astonishing. West Semitic Amorites (MAR.TU) travelled the Euphrates in "ships" before settling in Mesopotamia in the Ur III period. There are definite economic relationships between these nomads, who emanated from the Jebel Bishri region (near Palmyra), and the Sumerian administrative center at Drehem.'5 The later West Semitic Aramean nomads (Ahlamu), so menacing in the 14th century B.C., were certainly in northeast Arabia at that time.'" Caravans from North Syria reached Babylon, and the Kassites, at least part of the time, communicated with Failaka and Bahrain via the Sealand. This means the Kassites, Ahlamu, and Dilmunites were all in contact in northeast Arabia. As for the prized dates, they were available at al-Hasa, in Bahrain, and in the Basra region. 5. Brunswig, Parpola, and Potts, "Isin-Larsa Tablet" (discussed later in the volume under review). An Isin-Larsa (2050-1900 B.C.) tablet bearing only four Amorite names was found in the "basal level" of City 2 at Qala'at al-Bahrain; it is offered as evidence for the presence of Amorites in Bahrain. The tablet lay 50 cm. away from a circular stamp seal in semi- translucent(?) steatite carved with a representation of a short-horned bull and five known Harappan signs, although the language is probably non- Harappan (p. 106). In the same context were found ". . . 18 Dilmun seals and 6 weights of the Harappan type" (p. 107). It should be noted that the only properly indigenous material mentioned in this discussion are the 18 Dilmun seals! The tablet undoubtedly came from Mesopotamia, where the Amorites/West Semites introduced themselves in the Ur III period. The tablet, while perhaps of some use for dating City 2,~7 is not acceptable proof of even a limited Amorite population in Bahrain. 15. Cf. Buccellati's contribution, discussed below. 16. The historical range of the territory of the Ahlamu is also ignored by Potts in a recent article ("Nippur and Dilmun in the 14th century B.C.," PSAS 16 [1986] 169-74), where he proposes to equate the Ahlamu with the marauding Na'im Bedu of 19th century A.D.(1) Bahrain. The source of this information is J. G. Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia 2A (Calcutta, 1908) 249. 17. Cf. Serge Cleuziou, "Dilmun and Makkan During the 3rd and Early 2nd Millennium</page><page sequence="11">64 THERESA HOWARD-CARTER 6. G. Buccellati, The Amorites of the Ur III Period. Buccellati in his very lucid presentation notes at the outset that all previous works on the subject point clearly to a northwest origin for the Amorites,'s and, indeed, reminds us that the first meaning of the word amurru is "west." From Old Akkadian times on, the word amurru pertains to a nomadic people; later in Old Babylonian times amurru (as in rabi amurru) designates an official. Several texts which might seem to relate the Amorites to Dilmun are cited by Buccellati. CST 254 and TRU 305 are both from Drehem. CST 254 reads'9: "One fat sheep for the kitchen, concerning the MAR.TU and the diviners, coming from Dilmun." TRU 305 concerns "2 fat sheep for the kitchen, concerning the MAR.TU's and the diviners." Ake Sj6berg, who translated the texts for this review, states that from the present copy Dilmun cannot be read in the second text. At best what these texts tell us is that some Amorites and some diviners who had been in Dilmun were coming on a visit, and that preparations were being made for a welcoming meal. Finally, BIN 9 405, a tablet from Isin, records the manufacture of leather objects for Dilmun and for the Amorites. Is one obliged to assume the same destination for these goods? According to a literary composition, "The Home of the Fish,"20 "the nomads fetch him (the fish) away." Since the territorial range of the Amurru nomads is known to be the whole region south of the Euphrates from Jebel Bishri to the Wadi Batin, it seems not improbable that they were familiar with the techniques of procuring fish from the river. No doubt then, as now, the fish were edible, plentiful, and often very large. Alster's suggestion that the "fish" were caught by nomads dwelling on the Gulf and thence peddled to Sumerian cities is spurious. Buccellati concludes soundly, as he began, that the direct evidence from the tablets places the Amorites firmly northwest of Mesopotamia. Thus the support offered by Alster for his statement that the northern part of the Gulf must be excluded as a possible location for Dilmun at any time consists of the following: Weidner, Wiseman, and Borger, who discuss the land of Bazu and its sometime relationship with Dilmun in the Neo-Assyrian period.21 The letters treated by Cornwall concern the B.C.: A Tentative Review" Bahrain Through the Ages: Archaeology (Sheikha Haya Ali Al-Khalifa and Michael Rice, eds., London, 1986) p. 143: "... the duration and absolute dating of the best known period, city II, remains unclear." 18.

Brunswig, Parpola, and Potts discuss a tablet of Isin-Larsa date found on Bahrain that contains a short list of Amorite names. Buccellati confirms that there is no direct evidence for Amorites to have come from Dilmun in the Ur III period. This may seem an unreasonably long digression in criticism of a single footnote, but it gives a fair sample of Alster's somewhat casual approach to scholarship, which is evident in more than a few instances in his essay. The reader is further confused by Alster's point (no. 5 on p. 39) contending that some academics are still not convinced that the term Dilmun applies only to Bahrain, although the Greek name Tylos supports the opinion. He refers to R. Borger's review of Simo Parpola's Neo- Assyrian Toponyms,"2 in which Borger interprets the Neo-Assyrian inscription of Sargon II to mean that it takes two and one half days to reach Failaka from somewhere in Mesopotamia. That estimate is perfectly reasonable to cover the 90 km. distance from the Shatt al-Arab. However, the five inscriptions documenting this pronouncement23 are all from wall reliefs and other monuments in the Khorsabad palace, which is more than 1000 km. from the Gulf. Unless Sargon's river boats travelled five times faster than their modern counterparts, a literal interpretation raises some rather serious questions. Suffice it to say there are presently no Neo-Assyrian remains extant in Failaka; however, there are buildings and graves in Bahrain. Failaka, known as Ikaros to the Greeks, has an impressive Hellenistic establishment. Bahrain, known as Tylos to the Greeks, has a number of Hellenistic graves and in 1985 a post-Hellenistic temple was excavated. Alster has unquestion- ably mixed and muddied the Gulf waters. Among other additions and corrections that could be made are the following: (p. 40 n. 9) The appropriate references for copper mining in ancient Oman are now Gerd Weisgerber, "'. .. und Kupfer in Oman'-Das Oman- Projekt des Deutschen Bergbau-Museums," Der Anschnitt: Zeitschrift foir Kunst und Kultur in Bergbau 32 (1980) 62-110; "Mehr als Kupfer in Oman: 21.

Alster refers (footnote 24) to Flemming Hojlund, who upon the occasion of his visit to Kuwait in 1983 was asked to identify the location of the earth and plaster floors and stone walls allegedly beneath the Rulers' Villa.28 As Hojlund had no documented information on the subject, a small team from the Kuwait National Museum pursued the matter. A test pit was excavated in the northeast corner of the building in the place retained in Kuwaiti memory as the deepest sondage of the Danish excavators. At a depth of ca. 50 cm. below the lowest level of the excavated building the Kuwaiti team encountered stone slab paving. This confirmed earlier observations of the existence of a more, rather than less, substantial 24. Cf.

These buildings are dated by pottery and stamp seals to the first centuries of the second millennium, and are at a lower elevation than anything excavated previously in F-6. (p. 42) A more recent publication by Jean-Jacques Glassner, "Inscrip- tions cun6iformes de Failaka,"30 gives the following variant readings: Alster no. 3 = Glassner no. 2 (KM 1657): Egal.gula / ... / Inzak. Alster no. 4 = Glassner no. 5 (KM 1650; writing in positive): For the Great Goddess / his lady, / Ribkatum. Alster no. 5 = Glassner no. 39 (KM 3529): Glassner reconstructs only the name of the god Inzak on the fourth line. Alster no. 6 = Glassner no. 38 (KM 3528) is dedicated to the god Enki and mentions the god Inzak. Alster no. 7 = Glassner no. 6 (KM 1050): Ipnin?-PA.NI.PA / son ... of Sumu?-li?-el / servant of Inzak / of Agarum. Using Glassner's specific information regarding the 45 inscribed items from Failaka, we can summarize as follows: In the Old Babylonian "Epigraphic" period (1950-1500 B.C.), the cylinder seals are of Mesopo- tamian origin and one might presume they were brought by the persons who owned them. All three mention Enki, who may be an assimilated deity depicted on several of the stamp seals, seated in his rectangular shrine located in the Abyss beneath the salt waters of the sea. The four stamp seals, believed to have been made in Failaka, all mention the deity Inzak, either in connection with the temple, or associated with Agarum, which may be a tribe, the name for the island, or part of the mainland.3' Six of the steatite bowls, made elsewhere, but possible decorated or inscribed locally, mention either Inzak, Inzak and Enki, or the temple of Inzak. A rim fragment of local red ware also bears an inscription naming Enki, and a fragment of a clay tablet mentions the goddess Ninsikilla. Another steatite bowl fragment is inscribed with the Amorite name Ia-mi-u. In the subsequent Kassite-Mitannian period Marduk is mentioned four times and Adad once. Glassner's work may be considered definitive as he has examined the actual material in the collections of the Kuwait National Museum which 29. Cf. RIA 6 (1983) 293. 30.

One is Alster no. 1, the steatite bowl fragment with two skirted figures inscribed "Temple of Inzak,"32 which remains lost in Denmark. The second is part of a text on a potsherd from Failaka still in Moesgaard.33 Glassner was able to take into account the earlier efforts of both Kh. Nashef34 and Alster. Alster's narrative continues with some seven pages of speculation in which astrology, mythology, and climatology are intermixed with naviga- tion instructions, wind charts, arithmetic exercises, and assorted weather observations. A few explicit comments might usefully be made: 1. In any context and in all periods Dilmun when viewed from Mesopotamia was beyond its borders. 2. "Sailors" did not write texts or build temples. In Mesopotamia the first task was reserved to scribes; the other privileges to kings. "Sailors" did, however, know where the sun rose and set (p. 45). 3. Merchants did not necessarily travel; they were often likely to consign their cargo to the ancient version of a Nakhoda, the captain of a Gulf dhow.35 4. The consensus of retired Kuwaiti sailors is that the usual passage between Kuwait and Bahrain in a sailing dhow consumed two days (pp. 45-48). 5. Fish-eye stones are not pearls (p. 44).38 6. Alster (p. 48 and n. 67) has misinterpreted this reviewer's statements concerning Enki's travels. Nowhere in JCS 33 (1981) 210-23 is it stated or implied that Enki visited Dilmun. The abbreviated title "Enki's Journey" used for citation there refers to the Sumerian literary text "Enki's Journey to Nippur" (translated by Abdul-Hadi al-Fouadi). 7.

The frame boat employed by Severin could have originated in Mesopotamia, as Alster would no doubt agree, and served for practical daily usage. The prototype of the reed craft reconstructed by Heyerdahl is illustrated in ancient representations in association with rituals and is technically categorized as a raft. Reeds, which have a limited short life span are not suitable for voyages lasting more than six months. (Alster p. 51) According to C. Qualls, "The Ubaid period model from Eridu differs significantly from the Lothal model of the second half of the third millennium. Among other details we see that the former is a double ender with a socle which most likely served as a mast footing, while the Lothal model has a transom stern and a hole gouged into its interior bottom at an angle quite unlikely for a mast, unless one would argue for the presence of the forward-raking lateen mast at this early date. There is at least a thousand years difference in the dates for these models, during which wooden construction, as found in the Lothal model, was introduced. Thus I have great difficulty agreeing with Alster that "it [the Eridu model] does not differ much from a boat model found at Lothal .. ." The preceding section of this review dealt with Alster's Part I, "The identification of Dilmun." Alster summarizes his presentation as follows (p. 52): "From the point of view of textual sources and the history of seafaring the identification of Dilmun with Bahrain makes good sense, and this identification is valid for all periods of Mesopotamian history." Alster has not really produced in this essay sufficient evidence (new or old) to support that statement, which is in any case inadmissible on archaeological grounds. However, it must be reiterated37 that after the Ubaid 4 period there are no Mesopotamian artifacts in either Bahrain or Kuwait which can be dated earlier than 2200 B.C. In the second section of the essay Alster advances the thesis that Dilmun as described in Sumerian literature is actually a trade center characterized by its prosperity and articles of commerce rather than the paradise so often envisioned. There is very little reason to quarrel with Alster's principal argument, but again he seems to obfuscate the main issues with material which is less than supportive. He brings us to the brink of realization that modern scholars have disguised the Sumerian concepts of creation, 37. Cf. JCS 33 (1981) 223.</page><page sequence="17">70 THERESA HOWARD-CARTER afterlife, and immortality in conformance with Christian-Judaic theolo- gical tradition, which in some, but not all aspects owes much to Mesopotamian precedents. But he never really states this unequivocally. Alster tells us that the only Sumerian suggestions that Dilmun was Paradise are to be found in the Sumerian Flood Story where Ziusudra is immortalized by the deities after the flood and sent to dwell, "In the land of crossing, the land of Dilmun, the place where the sun rises . . . ,""38 and in the Enki and Ninhursag myth in which Dilmun is described as the clean, bright, and pure place where Enki lay with Ninsikilla in primeval times. Alster contends that the two texts should not be related in interpretation although Dilmun figures as a key place in both. This seems sensible since the antediluvian situation described in Enki and Ninhursag involves two time phases. The first is the time of a pure city, without or before life, in which Ninsikilla functions as Enki's wife; in the second phase we find a city which Enki has awarded to his daughter Ninsikilla and for which he must provide the necessary elements for mortal life. The Deluge story on the other hand describes a postdiluvian situation wherein the Sumerian Ziusudra ("the one with the long life"), or Akkadian Utnapishtim, awarded immortality by the gods for his ingenuity in preserving mankind, goes to live in Dilmun. It is patently clear from a subsequent episode in the Gilgamesh epic cycle that after the serpent relieved the Uruk hero of the plant of immortality Utnapishtim would not be joined in eternity or immortality by other Sumerians of any rank. Of prime consideration here is that both of the texts to which Alster refers were, in the form in which they are now extant, not recorded earlier than 1800 B.C.39 Thus the 18th century scribes are consciously rendering mythological accounts of creation and ensuing events. Certainly these same scribes were aware of contemporary commercial activities involving Dilmun. They may also have known of Early Dynastic commercial texts in which Dilmun often figured, but were possibly not aware that Dilmun was a political and geographic entity in the Uruk 4 period.40 In regard to 38.

While rightly discounting Lamberg-Karlovsky's suggestion42 that Bahrain served as a burial place for other populations, Alster begins again to tread in dangerous waters when he states: "In Mesopotamia the dead were always buried near the houses of their relatives, or even within the houses themselves." This is simply untrue; in Mesopotamia for ordinary persons intramural burials constitute a rarity, not a rule. They seem to occur in cases of siege or other catastrophe; graves may also be dug into earlier levels from later periods. Alster must surely be aware of cemeteries and fields of burial mounds, as well as such exceptions to the rule as the "priestly burials" in the Giparku and royal mausolea at Ur.43 The ubiquitous question which one wants to raise is never clearly advanced; namely, what did the Sumerians think happened when mortals died? We know that funeral arrangements and accouterments could be elaborate for royal personages such as the celebrated Queen Pu-Abi at Ur. Graves of ordinary adult persons in Mesopotamia almost always contain at least token grave goods, and often animal sacrifices as well. The tumulus form of burial so heavily represented in Bahrain, and known also in Eastern Arabia, differs from Mesopotamian practice only in the structure of the grave, not in its contents. The grave goods and other burial gifts all point to a certain confidence in the existence of life after death, although not necessarily one staged in a paradise land. We note the especially pertinent and recently excavated material from Bahrain.44 Alster points to the ki-a-nag-ga (defined by A. Sjdberg as "a place at the grave where water is poured into a pipe for the dead to drink in the nether world," quite commonly used in Ur III texts) where post-burial mourners 41.

We may be dealing here with the very simple concept that any aid rendered to a soul consigned to existence in the Netherworld was a positive action. Condi- tions in the Mesopotamian Netherworld are described in "The Death of Ur-Nammu and his Descent to the Netherworld".45 That text states that Ur-Nammu butchers oxen and sheep to prepare a very special banquet for the inhabitants, whose customary fare is described in line 82: "Bitter is the food of the Netherworld, brackish is the water of the Netherworldl" (It is interesting to note that Gilgamesh, who failed in his attempt to achieve immortality appears in Ur-Nammu's description of the Netherworld, where he is recognized as "king.") Alster refuses the generally assumed identification of "the mouth of the rivers" with the land of Dilmun. He proposes to dissociate the Ninevite Gilgamesh Epic "composed probably at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C." from the Deluge story because the Sumerian Ziusudra is sent to live forever in Dilmun while the Akkadian Utnapishtim goes only to the mouth of the rivers,46 even though many scholars would agree that the central immortal figure in both tales is one and the same. The crux of the matter seems to be that in one version of the story the location is described and in the other it is named. One can state simply that the Ziusudra-Utnapishtim- Noah story is a good one, and much of the imagery is as vivid for us today as when it was first recited at least 5500 years ago. In the Enki and Ninhursag myth Dilmun is a very special place, not the beginning place, but one constructed at the end of a long list of other acts. It was originally suitable only for deities, but then the improvements resulting from Enki's sweet-watering performance rendered it habitable for mortal creatures. It was natural for the story-teller to locate this special place beyond the known culture borders in the east, from which Utu emerged each morning. Nowhere can we discern that the Sumerians associated Dilmun with after- life. And they were fully aware of the existence of a real Dilmun when they were recording the versions of these stories which have survived. Alster need not have belabored the point by discussing the Ur interpolation of the Enki and Ninhursag myth, since his interpretation of the material is somewhat at variance with what others would read in the 45.

Specifically he refers to the opening lines of UET 6/1 1, which were most recently translated by P. Attinger47 as: Les villes sont 6tincelantes, distribuez-les leur. Le pays de Dilmun est 6tincelant. Sumer est 6tincelant, distribuez-la leur. Le pays de Dilmun est 6tincelant. Le pays de Dilmun est 6tincelant, le pays de Dilmun est vierge. Le pays de Dilmun est vierge, le pays de Dilmun est pur. This whole passage is a lovely description of a beautiful place written sometime in the 18th century B.C.48 In his Appendix B Alster gives us a further twenty-one lines of the text, which describe rare items to be brought from foreign lands to make Dilmun "a pleasant place"49 where "the grain is fine," "dates are large," "crops produce three times annually," and "trees are . .. trees."50 This is all splendid but should not ever be construed as ". .. an elaborate description of Dilmun as a commercial center."5' Alster continues to say that "Dilmun trade was at its height in the Larsa period" (ca. 2000-1800 B.C.), a rather excessive statement for which he presumably assumes support from the single archive at Ur discussed by Oppenheim.52 At the present time, however, we cannot adduce archaeological evidence to sustain such a claim. Alster concludes from his dissection of the Enki and Ninhursag myth, that it is a paradoxical explanation of the beginning of sexual intercourse, and leaves the reader in a quandary to choose chaos or paradise as a result. Alster summarizes the setting of the story in a laudable manner by placing it in the marshes of Mesopotamia where he believes the cult of Enki originated. Subsequently Dilmun was incorporated into Enki's sphere of influence. Alster is certainly on the right track in underlining the ubiquitous relationship between Enki-Eridu-Dilmun-Ninsikilla-purity. This makes very good sense indeed if one considers the glyptic art of Failaka and Bahrain, in addition to the inscriptions from Failaka. 47. ZA 74 (1984) 1-52. 48. Thus A. Sj6berg. 49. P. 65 line 17.

He might have pointed out that Dilmun, like Mecca, was a holy place, with the dual function of a prosperous trading center. This we know from tangible evidence and business documents based on the realities of daily life. But it is really an insurmountable task to follow Alster in his attempt to extract this material from the myths. A few minor corrections should be noted: (p.59) The comparison of Dilmun with Delos is perhaps an unfortunate choice. However the church of the Panagia on the island of Tinos could be reasonably substituted as a place where Greek sailors returning to the Piraeus are eager, even today, to pause and dedicate a ship model to the Virgin.53 (p. 60) For Appendix A (EWO) line 123, cf. the emended reading from the tablet given in JCS 33 (1981) 218 n. 47. (p. 64) At this writing no acceptable archaeological proof can be produced for "dock installations" in either Bahrain or Lothal. In the end Alster concludes with a very gracious paragraph of dedication to Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa. G. Pettinato, "Dilmun nella Documentazione Epigrafica di Ebla" (pp. 75-82). Pettinato provides us with some interesting new material from the third millennium archives found at Ebla. One major division of the sources hinges on whether or not the geographical determinative ki is present. A lexical list of geographical names identifies the Mesopotamian cities Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, Adad, Shuruppak, and Umma; the second part of this list mentions foreign countries that had relations with the cities of Sumer: (1) Elam(ki), (2) Dilmun(ki). Another text concerning the divinity of Enlil and Enki contains a list of three countries shubur(ki), sum-ar-rum(ki), dil- mun(ki); Pettinato suggests the text refers to a trade route. Lists of items in which Dilmun is appended without the (ki) designation include "Dilmun tin," copper, beer-bread, harp, and the "tree of Dilmun." Pettinato believes the last should be identified with the Dilmun date palm. The harp is illustrated on a stamp seal from Failaka (KM 432) and the lyre on another (KM 1115). However the most provocative item is surely the appearance of "Dilmun tin" in an Early Dynastic list from Ebla, a subject which should be of considerable interest to historians of metallurgy.54 53.

I am much indebted to the expertise of Tamara Stech for my comprehension of the following.</page><page sequence="22">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 75 Bronze is defined as an alloy of copper and tin; laboratory analyses have identified metal items from third and second millennia Mesopotamian sites as "pure copper," "arsenical copper," and "tin bronze." The existence of the last dictates the necessity for the importation of tin either in the form of ore or metal. The use of tin bronze in the Gulf at the beginning of the second millennium is documented by a few samples of bronze from Bahraini tumuli, excavated by E. Mackay in 1925.55 The analysis of the metal yielded the following composition, by percentages: copper, 87.77; iron, .53; tin, 11.70. More recent analyses of copper-base bronze materials from the Gulf are just beginning, so the extent to which tin bronze was actually used in the area has not really been explored.56 Some evidence has now accumulated that the cassiterite (so-called "tin- stone" often found in streams as rounded pebbles) may have emanated from fluvial sources further East, namely in the Sistan area (ancient Drangiana) in southwest Afghanistan.57 According to Muhly, "only in Afghanistan do we have the geological evidence for rich tin deposits within the context of an area known to be in contact with the major urban centers located to the west and to the south."58 The significance of this material and its connections with the Harappan site of Shortugai in northeastern Afghanistan, which so far has produced only arsenical copper, is a subject which holds great future interest.59 This information can be documented to some extent by reference to the entry an-na (tin) in the "A" volume of the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary.60 The following texts are relevant: (1) "May your (Melubba's) silver be gold, may your copper be tin (for) bronze" (EWO 231-23281); (2) "together with copper, tin, blocks of lapis lazuli,... ?, silver, and brilliant carnelian from Melubba" (Gudea Cyl B xiv 13).

There is much more to be said on the subject of tin; around the turn of the second millennium we find references to metal ingots.66 Landsberger tells us that tin ingots are called ?uqlu and weigh ca. 25 kg.67 The high oxidation rate of raw tin makes its survival in archaeological context most unlikely. George Bass reports from the Gelidonya wreck (ca. 1200 B.C.) only "white, powdery tin-oxide" in contrast to the dozens of copper ingots of both oxhide and bun shape.68 The ingots recovered so far in the Gulf are of the latter form.

Our knowledge of this international commerce has expanded considerably in the last few years, as is illustrated by, for example, the glyptic and artistic by-products of the trade.7" One artistic motif, the three-toed monster, apparently originated in Margiana73; it later appears equally at home in the glyptic repertoire of the Gulf.74 Pettinato presents a list of Dilmun names in titles and professions. An interesting reference is to the GAL.ZA (=enku, "tax-collector).'l" In connection with his discussion of the Dilmun weight, Pettinato confronts the scholars who suggest he may have mis-read the sign for Dilmun, confusing it with AL and MAU. Using examples from lexical and economic texts, he strives to prove his reading correct. Further analysis must be left to the philologists. Pettinato concludes most reasonably that (1) Ebla's contacts with Dilmun are by way of Sumer; (2) Dilmun is documented as a geographical entity, with and without the determinative (ki); (3) A unit of weight known as the Dilmun shekel is employed in commercial transactions at Ebla.76 70.

In a brief three pages (including notes) Hrushka contributes much new information not previously col- lected in one place; this is a most welcome enrichment of our rather paltry fund of third millennium cultural knowledge. He mentions accounts, ration lists, and a field text in which the sign Dilmun appears next to the personal name, thus posing the eternal question whether it is part of the name, or whether it describes a person from or belonging to Dilmun. In the main, the texts date to the First Dynasty of Lagash (2400-2350 B.C.); ten older texts come from Fara. Ladies of the Lagash royal family are shown in an important role in several of the economic tablets where shipments to and from Dilmun are consigned to certain merchants. Some of the exports mentioned are costumes, flour products, fat, ointments, cedar resin, wool, and silver objects. Imports for the royal ladies from Dilmun included: sometimes large quantities of raw copper (ore) and, most fascinating, costumes made from Dilmun-linen. Intended to dress statues of the royal family for the Feast of the Goddess Bau, these were delivered directly to the queen of Urukagina. Another provocative text refers (12-15 times) to offerings of bronze models of Dilmun ships, made by the Prince's Lady to the Goddess Nanshe. Other of the texts refer to merchants (especially one Urenki) who bring quantities of copper ore to be used as a trade item; to Dilmun ships that transport wood from "mountain lands"; and to a Dilmun worker employed as a navigator. Also mentioned are onions: Dilmun onions are planted in Lagash vegetable gardens, particularly in a field belonging to the royal family; Dilmun onions are also deposited in the "treasure house." The subject of onions was previously expounded by Gelb,7 according to whom the Mesopotamians designated as onions, not only all of the plants of the alliaceous family, but sometimes also flax, coriander, beans, lettuce, and turnips. "Onions" were grown in fields, measured, and stored in specific containers; later they were collected and distributed by a professional controller. Recipients of onions were often "lords." Many of the lots of onions were provided specifically for the tables of kings and governors, while other distributions were made on the occasion of the return of dignitaries from foreign countries. A goodly number of the texts refer to the two-fold distribution of fish and "onions." The texts cited by 77.

This contribution should be warmly received as Hrushka furnishes us with abbreviated notes from at least a dozen tablets not previously discussed in translated form. Robert Englund, "Exotic Fruits" (pp. 87-89). In a brief note concerning the importance of Dilmun in the Old Akkadian period Englund suggests that, except for metal exchange, Dilmun, Magan, and Melubba were not economically vital to Mesopotamian interests. The five texts he cited, from Umma and Girsu, deal with workers and rations; they indeed seem to bear out his interpretation. However, in an earlier presentation Foster attrib- uted a greater significance to them78: "Umma ... appears to have had direct connections with Dilmun (=Bahrain), Magan (=Makran?), and Melubba (=Indus Valley?), as an Indus seal impression is said to have been found at the site and a ship's agent from Melubba received oil rations.'"7 The triumphal inscriptions of Sargon and Naram-Sin ". . . suggest that the interconnections between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley were both direct and frequent in this period."80 Englund argues that the claims in royal inscriptions of control over Dilmun, Magan, and Melubba, and references to ships from there, is largely a question of prestige, although he notes that the ships were "... with some certainty ..." carrying cargoes of copper, hardwoods, and diorite. In support he refers to the inscribed Neo-Sumerian Statue D of Gudea. He might usefully have cited also the diorite feet of the Akkadian statue of Naram-Sin,8s whose inscription reads that he subjugated Maniu, Lord of Magan, quarried stone for his statue in the mountains of that land and transported it to Akkad. That the great majority of Akkadian statues were made of diorite is well-attested archaeologically.82 This preference for diorite statues continues into Neo-Sumerian times.8s3 Flemming Johan- sen summarizes the evidence as follows: "All of the Gudea statues ... found in the excavations, with a single exception, are of dark diorite."84 78.

The last is presumably the sort of dedication model referred to in RTC 23 rev. i 3-4, "9 minas of copper alloyed with tin (for) a bronze Dilmun-boat."8s Text 68 is concerned with the removal of barley, Magan copper, and leather, while text 162 records quantities of silver, copper, tin, and bronze. In any list of the foreign economic contacts of the Akkadian period, an extract from the text of the Cruciform Monument of Manishtusu should be considered.87 It tells us that the king crossed the Lower Sea in ships and subjugated the kings of 32 cities enjoined in battle against him; he seized the whole country as far as the silver mines and returned with stones for his statues from the mountains beyond the Lower Sea.88 It should be noted that argentiferous galena ores are marked in Oman in the Jebels Akhdar/Nakhl and in the Ruus al Jibal at the Hormuz Straits.89 Kilian Butz, "Dilmun in Wirtschaftstexten der Ur-III-Zeit" (p. 91).

The rationale prompting the triple dedication he explains as (1) Inshushinak, the Elamite deity who presides over passage to the afterworld; (2) Enki, the Mesopotamian deity of pure water and the great Abyss; (3) Enzak, the Lord of Dilmun, the Mesopo- tamian Paradise.90 Reviewing relations between Dilmun and Susa, Vallat makes a sound economic statement which is obvious, but rarely expressed: viz., Susa and Dilmun had very little to trade with one another since each was a market- emporium in its own right, Susa the terminus of the terrestrial route from the Zagros and further east, conveying the same materials to Mesopotamia, which Dilmun handled as the focal point on the maritime route. Vallat's essay is slightly marred by lack of attention to detail; one example will suffice: He notes the presence of five Gulf stamp seals at Susa dating to the 20th century B.C. and cites Amiet's Glyptique Susienne MDAI 43 (1972) as his source. Amiet in fact mentions four steatite seals resembling those of the Gulf in form and decoration.9' I have consulted with C. Qualls for comparisons from the Failaka seals, both published and unpublished, and she notes the following: no. 1716, lozenge with gazelles around: exact parallel; no. 1717, skirted figure with reed shield and gazelle: very similar example; no. 1718, figure on platform flanked by gazelles: very similar example; no. 1719, cannot be identified as a Gulf scene; no. 1720, as indicated by Amiet, the form of the bitumen seal is Gulf-related, but iconography and decoration are not. The point should also be made that very few scholars would date the Gulf seals precisely to the 20th century B.C.; in fact their production must span at least 300 years, ca. 2000-1700.92 R.

In addition, three important new inscribed finds are mentioned: the triangular prism from Hajjar I (Bahrain), the piriform stamp from Maysar (Oman), and the sherd with Harappan graffito from Ras al-Junayz (Oman); we await the promised discussion (p. 101) of the prism and stamp by Weisgerber, Parpola, and Potts.94 The material presented can be summarized as follows, using the authors' identification system: Provenance (including the attributions): Iraq (1, 2); Luristan (3, 4, 5); Failaka (6, 7); Bahrain (8, 9, 10). Circumstances: "excavated" (2, 6, 7, 8, 9); stratigraphically coherent context for date of manufacture (8). Material: steatite (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9); other colored stone (2, 5). Form: square (1, 2); circular (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); oblong (3); stepped sided (5). Reverse: regular Dilmun (4, 7, 10); high boss, 1-line (3, 8, 9); loop (1, 2); thin loop (6); bi-facial (5). Obverse: inscribed (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9); Indian fauna'5 (1, 2, 3, 4, ??6); Gulf figures (4); other (5). Inscription: Harappan (1, 2, ?3, ?6,); non-Harappan (7, 8); Indus signs (9). With the exception of no. 5, the seals discussed are apparently inter- related by inscription, form, subject matter, or material. Any attempt to place them in some chronological framework is entirely dependent upon seal no. 8, which was found by the Danes in 1970 "in the basal foundations of the earliest City II wall gateway approximately half a meter away from the tablet . . ." This tablet, which is epigraphically dated to the early Isin-Larsa period (2050-1900 B.C.), is now widely employed to date City 2 at Qala'at al-Bahrain as well as strata in other sites manifesting similar ceramic and other materials. Since six weights of Harappan type and 18 Gulf seals were found "in this level" as well, it would be useful if the excavators could provide us with more details concerning this area, in the form of section and plan. Questions which need to be answered include: Over how much area does this stratum extend? Is it intended as a 94. Meanwhile see E. C. L.

Given the present uncertainty concerning the physical limits of the stratum, it would perhaps go too far to use the tablet found in it to date both seals no. 8 and no. 9 (no. 9 does not have a precise context). The implications of the tablet for the problem of the Amorites are discussed elsewhere in this review. One is grateful for copy, transliteration, and translation of the text. Other points should be made. No comprehensible distinction between "Persian Gulf" style, "Gulf" style, and "Dilmun" style was made previous- ly, nor is the terminology clarified here."9 Which kind of red-ridged ware makes its appearance here? In our present state of knowledge it is not possible to prove definitely that City 2 on Bahrain is equivalent to the "earliest material" on Failaka. Neither have the "basal levels" of Failaka mounds F-6 and F-3 been defined or demonstrated. It is most unlikely that any of the Gulf stamp seals can be dated to the Kassite period. Stratigraphic location does not solve these problems; one must take into account the ancients' preservation of heirlooms, liberally strewn through- out the levels in Failaka and Bahrain. The authors bring fascinating material into focus with the publication of the step-sided stamp seal of Turkmenistan type and the thought-provoking discussion which ensues. Kilian Butz, "Zwei Kleine Inschriften zur Geschichte Dilmuns" (pp. 117-25). Butz discourses at some length on the well-known Middle Babylonian inscription ("Palace of Rimun, servant of the god Inzak of Agarum") found by Capt. Durand in 1879, incorporated in the structure of a Bahraini mosque. The inscription, enframed by a cartouche and accompanied by a palm tree (of the simple schematic type often depicted on cylinder seals of the early second millennium), occupies only a small area on the foot-shaped lump which measures 65 cm. in length. Sadly, the piece exists now only in a drawing. It would be interesting to know if it could have formed part of a statue; if so, the dimensions would have been more than twice life-size, a grandeur not heretofore attained during the second millennium in Mesopotamia or the Gulf. Butz summarizes that in mid-second millennium Dilmun merchants acted as middle-men, between the oases Hofuf and Qatif in Eastern Arabia, which are especially famed for the quality of their dates. According to Butz the date producers are identified as "the tribe of Hagar" (probably Agarum).97 Butz proposes that 96. Cf. Potts, Dilmun: BHASJ 11 (1983). 97.

At best this is all very tenuous, as are further references to Amorites in Dilmun, a subject treated elsewhere both in the volume and in this review."9 The other "little" inscription (2.5 cm.) occurs on a rectangular stone amulet from an ancient grave on the Greek island of Kythera. Butz tells us it is an antique copy made by a Greek who could not describe the signs accurately; this seems plausible enough.-" The circumstances of the amulet's discovery are unknown, as is its present whereabouts. The inscription was treated by Unger in 1929,100 who read: "For the god Inzak of Dilmun, Naram-Sin, son of Ipiq-Adad, for his life." Thorkild Jacobsen considered that reading untenable and translated the two lines which concern us here as "To the god . . . , king of . . . "; he suggested that Eshnunna be restored in line 2,101 and Nougayrol drew attention to an amethyst cylinder seal in the Louvre containing the terms dingir Ipiq-Adad and Dur-Rimush.102 The entire matter is by this time clearly removed from Dilmun and Inzak, yet Butz wishes to return to Unger's rendering, in the form of dingir In-za-ak ?a DIL-ki, which is close but not exact. It is not evident how Butz proposes to substantiate his position. Even apart from the irrelevance of one of the two inscriptions discussed, Butz's concluding statement that the two small inscriptions reflect some- thing of the great Dilmun merchant power in the Gulf and the dimensions of that trade is perhaps excessive. The quality of the transliteration reproduction would be best assessed by an epigraphist. D. Potts, "Barbar Miscellanies," (pp. 127-39). The first note, entitled "A Temple to Shamash on Bahrain?," embraces a questionable subject. Potts states at the outset that "Rarely have scholars worked in reverse, by taking a modern place name and then trying to document its derivation .. ." And for a very good reason. There is not one shred of evidence to attach the name Barbar to any of the third or second millennium temples. Bibby does not mention that any inscriptional material was recovered during the 98.

In doing so he comes nearer the mark than Potts, who proposed a link with temples at Larsa and Sippar named E-babbar. These temples were dedicated to Shamash. There is no support for Pott's proposal, from either iconography or epigraphic sources: Shamash does not occur in the Failaka inscriptions until he is introduced by the Kassites. In contrast the documentation for Enki is strong in both categories. Perhaps one might be well-advised to review the Eridu material of the Neo-Sumerian period for possible connections. This is in all a provocative philological exercise, but the proposition is not tenable. Strangely enough, just a year earlier Potts wrote: "I would place less weight on ... attempts to link ancient and modem place names, aware of the dangers inherent in so-called Klangetymo- logie . ."106 The second note is concerned with "The so-called 'Egyptian' alabaster vases from Barbar Temple III." Potts is to be commended for putting this matter before a scholarly audience. In the opinion of this reviewer what can be reliably stated about alabaster vases at the present writing is as follows: (1) Alabaster vases are to be found from the Uruk period onwards at the centers of high civilization in Egypt, Sumer, and Iran; they are emblems of wealth and prestige because of the time and cost expended in their production, and in fact they begin life as heirlooms.'17 (2) As Potts quite correctly asserts the vases are not useful as dating criteria'08 (except perhaps as a terminus ante queml). (3) Reasonable parallels in shapes can 103. Looking for Dilmun pp. 69-74, 93-94, 114-15, 147, 157-61, 193, 235-37, 270, 337, and esp. p. 347. 104.

(4) The really important consideration is the origin of the material from which the vessels were manufactured. Glob originally misled us by stating unequivocally that "in shape, size, and material two of these vessels have their closest parallels in Mesopotamia and Egypt" and that "similar vessels have been found at several sites, including Ur, and must have the same origin as these.""12 As Potts points out, both Lucas and Reisner rejected the suggestion that the alabaster was Egyptian. (5) In Failaka perhaps a dozen fragments have been excavated that are similar by "eye examination" to the material of the Bahrain vases. No reconstruction of forms has yet been attempted. All the fragments are presently being analyzed at ISMEO in Rome, and it should be emphasized that the immediate reaction of the Italian team"3 was that the fragments were of Iranian alabaster. Thus Potts (p. 130) does well to point in this direction. A preliminary analysis of the calcite vase fragments under study by Dr. R. Ciarla now indicates that they ". . . are for the majority from eastern Iran (i.e., Shahr-i Sokhta and Baluchistan)," based on typological comparisons. The two exceptions are a fragment of a spheroid vessel bearing a scant inscription of three signs in two lines, and a fragment from a globular vessel with relatives in Tepe Yahya."4 The third note concerning "The Anthropomorphic Mirror Handle" first identified as such by S. N. Rao,"5S provides yet another link in the burgeoning body of cultural connections between the Near East and areas farther to the east. As Potts indicates (p. 131) the recent intensified archae- ological activity in the eastern Iran-Afghanistan-Uzbekistan region has expanded our knowledge of a largely neglected area. We may reasonably hope for artistic and technological revelations beyond our present awareness in the areas of stone bowl carving, metallurgy, and seal cutting. Potts' concluding note concerns "Barbar Chronology." The four points which he makes in connection with the dating of the temples at Barbar qualify as simple and sound. 109. Potts, Dilmun 129. 110.

Powell gives a modest one-page summary of the most recent scholarship on the subject of weights; in it his predominant theme is caution. He reviews the theories advanced by M. Roaf,"6 who proposes that the Dilmun mina was valued at 278 of the Ur mina. It is now generally agreed"' that Dilmun and the Indus Valley were on a similar standard, in terms not only of weight and mass, but also of the physical form of the weight itself, while the Ur standard represents another system. According to Roaf"8 the Ur system is sexa- gesimal (that is, 60 shekels = 1 mina, 60 minas = 1 talent) as compared with the Dilmun/Indus system, where eighths and hundredths seem to be the rule. (In very round terms this should give that 5 shekels [Dil] = 20 shekels [Ur].)11" However, as Powell points out, in those instances where it has been possible to obtain precise gram weights, they fall within a general range, but are hardly accurate. It is not known on what material or concept the Dilmun weight was based, although, as Powell comments in n. 9, it would be useful to have this information. Nevertheless the present evidence (n. 2) indicates that the Gulf and Indus (Dilmun, Magan, and Melubba) operated on a unified standard and were able to develop the conversion system necessary to conduct a flourishing trade with the Mesopotamians.120 Indeed, Powell is far too modest in his presentation; the material, including that relegated to footnotes, has far-reaching implications for an understanding of trade and economics in the Gulf and its surroundings in the third and second millennia. The hard evidence (treated by Powell in n. 2) consists of seven cuboid and flattened spherical weights of steatite, chert, limestone, and a marble-like stone found in a cache with twelve Gulf stamp seals in City 2 of Qala'at al-Bahrain.121 These weights are of the well-known Harappan type, of which several hundred have been excavated at Indus Valley sites, mostly fashioned from chert.122 Others of the same 116.

However, by 200 B.C. the weights themselves, of banded Indian chert, are the standard from Magan and Dilmun as well. This means that by the third quarter of the of the third millennium Dilmun, Magan, and Melubba were sufficiently sophisticated and organized to conduct an exchange of commodities using a standard system of measurement. By no means could these goods be classified as gifts, tribute, or in kind. This was the real world of commerce; materials from eastern areas were consigned via Mesopotamia to kingdoms in central and northern Syria. The appellation "Dilmun shekel" was used to describe the monetary unit of this system because Dilmun, being close, was more familiar to the Sumerian merchants. Kilian Butz, "Dilmun in Altbabylonischen Quellen" (pp. 143-45). Butz states that intensive trade relations between Mari, Babylon, and Dilmun are until the present time not textually well-documented. For this he refers in general to Oppenheim's familiar article "Seafaring Merchants"'18 But Oppenheim dealt with the matter only very briefly on p. 15, noting that although the Hammurabi Dynasty seems to have had no commercial or political connections with Dilmun, such relations are mentioned in the Mari letters. Butz mentions the "Leather Texts" from Isin, rarely noted elsewhere in connection with Dilmun.129 All are consignments of goods bound for Dilmun.

The Ur texts Butz cites from UET 5 about the Dilmun trade are well- known from Leemans'30 and Oppenheim.'31 Butz, discussing one Ur text, UET 5 107:8,132 about cattle pastures belonging to the Temples of Nanna and Ningal located near Eridu and the Hor [al Hammar] (possibly then Marshlands?), advances the entertaining notion that this was the location of a settlement of Dilmunites. This is actually an idea with some merit, if, as the hydrologists now tell us, a branch of the Euphrates ran southeast to the Gulf and continued along the line of what constitutes the modern Khor Bubiyan. A recently published text of unknown provenance'33 dating to Samsu- iluna, Hammurabi's successor, is also discussed. This list of metal objects terminates with the following: "12 mana refined copper of Alashiya and of Tilmun." One might have assumed Mari as the source for this tablet but for the second element of ti-il-mu-ni; as Sasson observes in connection with another text mentioning Dilmun,'34 the name is written with -el- in the three Mari letters in which it occurs. The text referred to by Sasson was thought to be the tablet copy of the "Victory Stela of Zimri-Lim," also mentioned by Butz. The stela was thought to have commemorated the return of the Mari king from distant regions. Among other places and peoples men- tioned are Haneans, Suheans, Ekallatum, Babylon (twice); and "la ville de Tilmun."'35 Sasson stated that "... mention of Tilmun in 1. 20 is puzzling."'36 Charpin and Durand'37 recently treated this text at length; they reversed its obverse and reverse and gave a new transliteration, translation, and discussion of the text. The text is no longer to be associated with Zimri-Lim's reconquest of Mari, but rather relates the military exploits of Psme-Dagan and Iasmah-Adad.; Dilmun is mentioned just as it breaks. Charpin and Durand suggest that the mention of Dilmun in this text 130. Leemans, Foreign Trade (1960) pp. 22-56. 131. JAOS 74 (1954) 6-17. 132. Cited by Butz as UET 107:8. 133. A. R.

Butz discusses only two of the three Mari letters in which Dilmun is mentioned in association with "caravans" (ARM 1 17, ARM 5 14). The neglected letter (ARM 1 21), if considered in its entirety, is perhaps the most interesting because in the last section Shamshi-Adad I, writing to his son Iasmah-Adad, gives detailed instructions for the refining treatment of a shipment of copper which has been collected from a distance away of "10 or 20 double hours"! This letter is usually noted'38 only for its first part, which concerns a Dilmun messenger apprehended for stealing a palm chest from a merchant. That the other half of the letter refers to the treatment of copper may be a coincidence, but one might do well to take it into account when seeking sources of copper. It should be noted that the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary gives a different interpretation of ARM 1 21:7-9~39: "he (the messenger from Telmun) went into the merchant's house and obtained the cedar cuttings (but I could not send him on to you yet)." A recently published list of oil distributions to palace, temples, and officials at Mari contains the item "oil for the king of Dilmun," a clear indication that the Dilmunite king was a visitor at the Mari court during the reign of Iasmah-Adad.'40 K. Kessler, "Zu den keilschriftlichen Quellen des 2./1 Jahrtausends v. Chr. iiber Dilmun" (pp. 147-60). Kessler begins with the "Dilmun Letters" from Nippur dated to the Kassite king Burnaburiash II'~4 published by Cornwall.'42 The subject of Ahlamu incursions into settled areas (in this case pilfering from Dilmunite date plantations) has been discussed previously in the volume and this review.

In times of famine... (they) were quite likely to cause trouble and steal food ... This pattern of hungry semi-nomads stealing food and other goods from settled areas is not an isolated phenomenon in Babylonian history." In an attempt to answer his own question as to the extent of Kassite influence in the Gulf region, Kessler has done us a very good turn by recalling a provocative report of Dr. Georges Roux,144 who referred to Tell el-Lahm as one of the two southernmost sites excavated in Iraq.145 This footnote leads us to an examination of sites in lower Iraq and the evidence produced therefrom. Fuad Safar1'4 reports material from six sondages on the main mound of Tell el-Lahm and four on the adjacent plain. The main mound contained a "fairly large" Early Dynastic settlement and was "inhabited extensively during the Akkadian rule, the Isin-Larsa period, and the era of the 1st Dy. of Babylon down to the end of the Kassite period."'47 Sondages on the plain produced evidence for the succeeding Neo- Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenean periods. Architecture and graves are described and pottery profiles support Safar's statement. Among other inscriptional material discovered was a clay cylinder of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus,'4s subsequently published by H. W. F. Saggs,'49 who provided a copy, transliteration, and translation which concludes as follows: "At that time E.AMAS.Kfi.GA, 'The Shining Enclosure,' the house of Ningal, the shining Lady of the Universe, which is within Dur, which had become weak with age (and) of which the walls bulged, ..."o150 Concerning the ancient name of the site Saggs argued reasonably that the site Dur may have reference to Dur-Iakin, a recognized fortress of the Sealands belonging to the Bit-Iakin tribe.'5t Kessler simply cites "Tell el Lahm (Kisik)" without documentation (p. 147), possibly after Jacobsen,152 who interpreted the text of the Lahm cylinder somewhat differently and assigned the temple to Ishtar, using supporting evidence 144.

Saggs took this to be the "main channel or a branch of the Euphrates."'54 Jacobsen'55 describes the Id-nun Canal, which "must have" followed the ridge southeast from Ur to Lahm; he also noted three sila of oil stowed on a boat for Kissik (UET 3 1181). W. R011ig'51 favored the identification KISIGA, KISSIK = Tell el-Lahm with reservations: "City in S. Sealands, precise locus unknown, but cf. Tell el-Lahm." He repeated the earlier information that in the Ur III period the name might also be read as DURUM. Michalowski'57 has now disposed of the proposition that Lahm ever was Durum; instead Umm al-Wawiya, equidistant between Larsa and Uruk on the main canal seems a more likely candidate.'ss The essence of the dependable Dr. Roux's information is based on his surveys, in 1954 and 1955, of a series of tells along an east-west line following the ancient course of the Euphrates, from a point southwest of Ur to Tell Nahr cUmar (ca. 30 km. north of Basra) on the Shatt al-Arab. These tells were largely obscured by reeds, but were visible on aerial photographs. Three of these tells (Abu Salabikh'59; Agram; and Nahr cUmar) contained identifiable material of the Kassite period'60 and the first millennium. This should establish a settled southern boundary for Kassite Babylonia generally along a 30'-45' latitude line, therefore leaving a considerable area west northwest of Basra for the northern extension of "Dilmun" and the Sealanders.'6' One more surprising bit of information from Dr. Roux is that the Hor al-Hammar is of very recent formation'62; it is never mentioned by Chesney who could not have missed this body of water, especially impressive in rough weather when land is no longer visible on any side. (But does this necessarily mean that it was not there in antiquity?) The line 153. Sumerische Kultlieder p. 199 rev. iii 36. 154. Sumer 13 (1957) 193. 155. Jacobsen, Iraq 22 (1960) pl. 28. 156.

Dilmun in the Middle Assyrian period is still documented only by an inscription of Tukulti-Ninurta I (1244-1208) on an alabaster tablet which concerns the construction of the new capital at Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta.'13 A part of the "unique" epithet reads: "King of Sumer and Akkad, King of Sippar and Babylon, King of Tilmun and Melubba, King of the Upper and Lower Seas." It might be usefully noted here that although Makkan was in this case dropped from the familiar Dilmun-Magan-Melubba formula, it does occur at least four times in inscriptions of Tukulti-Ninurta I,164 always in association with "the remoter lands of Nairi," identified with the Lake Van region of southeastern Anatolia, inhabited by a Hurrian population. This abrupt topographic shift emphasizes an inherent danger in the de facto employment of toponymic evidence. As Munn-Rankin explains1'5: "The reference to Makan shows the confused ideas of the Assyrians about countries beyond their immediate ken. The scribes having heard of Magan on the Gulf of Oman [sic] as a distant land, located it in the unknown territory to the W. of Nairi."'e1 Kessler discusses the Neo-Assyrian Dilmun-related inscriptions in an orderly manner. At Khorsabad there are five similar inscriptions of Sargon II,117 and Kessler quotes from one of these: "Uperi, King of Dilmun, whose camp is situated a journey of 30 beru in the midst of the sea, like a fish, heard of the might of Assur and brought his gifts."'8s We discussed above the difficulties of reconciling the measurement of 30 double hours reckoned from Khorsabad to any proposed location for Dilmun. To figure this distance from the older capital Assur does not improve the situation a great deal.'"" It may be of some importance to cite here portions of a deviant inscription170 involving not only contact with, but claimed "subjugation" of Uperi: "Mita of Mushki ... heard of the . .. conquests of 163.

The other familiar inscription discussed by Kessler'71 reads: "Bit Iakin on the Bitter Sea as far as the border of Dilmun." This seems to place the tribes of the marshes or Sealands squarely between Babylonia and Dilmun and also on the shore of the Gulf, which must then be identified as the region immediately south of Zubair. Kessler raises the question whether we are dealing with "border" as a concept or reality and lists various scholars' preferred identifications for this period: Albright, Cornwall, and Alster favored Bahrain; Borger selected Failaka; Dougherty named the whole coast to Bahrain; and Thompson, Deimel, and Howard-Carter would have the "border" in southernmost Mesopotamia. This reviewer now suggests that Dilmun in the Neo-Assyrian period consisted of the basic kingdom lbcated in Bahrain, where there are substantial archaeological remains of an admin- istrative building at Qala'at al-Bahrain as well as a number of Assyrian graves. Archaeological evidence shows that Failaka is to be excluded from the Dilmun orbit at the end of the Kassite period; there is not a trace of extant identifiable Neo-Assyrian material on the island or the mainland. Therefore one could postulate that the "border" of Dilmun consisted of the outposts of a community of Dilmun traders who would have been occupied in controlling the caravan trade which we know continued in the Assyrian period. For sound economic reasons they would not have been subject to harassment by the kings of Assyria. For the reign of Sennacherib, Kessler refers only to the building inscription from the Temple of the New Year's Feast outside the Assur city walls,'72 in which the king mentions that the Dilmunites feared his might after he razed Babylon, and that they therefore remitted tribute in the form of artisans, laborers, copper tools, vessels, and a chariot. According to Kessler the inscription has no topographic relevance. Two passages from the annals not adduced by Kessler must be considered relevant to the 171.

Both concern the problem of the location of Chaldea, which seems to intrude between Babylonia and the tribes of Bit-Iakin.'73 For Esarhaddon Kessler cites a building inscription74 preceded by an excessive formulaic list of titles which includes "King of the Kings of the lands Dilmun, Magan, and Melubba"I Another Esarhaddon inscription quoted75 deals with the plundering of Bazu, a place on the way to Dilmun, where he proceeded to lay tribute on King Qana. The critical toponym here is Bazu, which appears to be on the road to Melubba as well!'76 For the reign of Ashurbanipal Kessler discusses the illumination of relations with Dilmun contained in tribute lists and letters from the Nineveh archives and other fragments of letters which document an exchange between King Hundaru of Dilmun and the Assyrian monarch. Kessler presents a skillful interpretation of the political nuances involved. Of particular interest is the fragment of a letter now lost,'77 from the Assyrian king to Hundaru, who dutifully pays tribute in the form of large amounts of copper, kohl, parts of mountain sheep, and cut-off pieces of wood. Yet he plots with the King of Elam against Assyria. Kessler also mentions a baffling Assyrian "district list" according to which Dilmun appears at that time to be located between Eridu and Kisik (Tell el-Lahm?) 173. Fourth Campaign iii 50-74, ARAB 2 241 and 242. According to ARAB 2 241, "In my 4th campaign, Assur, my lord, gave me courage and I mustered my numerous armies and gave the command to proceed against Bit lakin. In the course of my campaign I accomplished the overthrow of Shuzubi, the Chaldean, - who sat in the midst of the swamps, - in the city of Bitutu. That one, - the terror (lit. chills) of my battle fell upon him and broke his courage (lit. tore his heart); like a criminal(?) he fled alone, and his place was seen no more. The front of my yoke I turned and to Bit lakin I took the way." ARAB 2 242 tells us that: "That (same) Merodach-baladan, whose defeat I had brought about in the course of my first campaign, and whose forces I had shattered, - the roar of my mighty arms and the onset of my terrible battle he feared and he gathered together the gods of his whole land in their shrines, and loaded them into ships and fled like a bird to the city of Naqite-rakki, which is in the midst of the sea. His brother, the seed of his father's house, whom he had left by the seashore, together with the rest of the people of his land, I brought out of Bit lakin, (from) the midst of the swamps and canebreaks, I devastated, I made like ruin heaps. Upon his ally, the king of Elam, I poured out terror." These passages provoke so many problems the subject should perhaps be reserved for a separate essay. 174. VAS 178. 175.

A similar location is indicated by an inexplicable line on a tablet describing the Ritual for the Observance of Eclipses from Ashurbanipal's Library at Nineveh'7s: "I am a man from Telmun whose boat has sunk in the marshes"'79 Kessler also reminds us that in the Neo-Assyrian period three rulers of Dilmun are named, viz. Uperi, Qana, and Hundaru; their names are still etymologically obscure. Kessler concludes by comparing the late location of Dilmun to the problem of Nairi, the land referred to in the inscriptions of Tukulti-Ninurta s110 as "next to Makan."''s Kessler has performed a meritorious task by collecting and presenting this scattered and often perplexing material in organized form. Further research and interpretations are left to the reader. R. Krauss, P. Lombard, and D. Potts, "The Silver Hoard from City IV, Qala'at al-Bahrain" (pp. 161-66). This is one of the more interesting articles in the volume. The material, which is carefully treated, will be new to some as it is associated with the mid-first millennium, so far only slightly documented in the Gulf itself. Lombard describes a hoard consisting of 583 pieces of silver and 11 of electrum found in a pit dug down from a City IV floor. The ceramic container is well-attested on the basis of comparisons for the Neo- Babylonian period, and detailed as brownish, slipped, and with explosive grits in the biscuit, (which might by a less experienced observer be ascribed to the "Early Barbar" period). Of the fragments 228 are classed as jewellery, and Lombard marks convincing similarities in pieces from Ur, Boghazkoy, and Dhahran. The signet ring is discussed by Krauss who dates it to 650 B.C. on typological grounds, appraises the hieroglyphs and non- hieroglyphs, and concludes that it was probably produced in Phoenicia. Potts treats the significance of the hoard in terms of practical usage. According to Potts, recent work by Marvin Powell'82 indicates that rings, 178. BRM 4 6:10. 179. CAD $ sub QmuS.

Powell has made a good case for bitqu = '/8 shekel = "cutting." This would account for scraps of a certain size being cut off the coil, as contrasted with the larger units of chunks, bars, and the like. Potts (p. 164) stresses the fact that this system of the early "money" is based only on weight, yet, as he notes, no weights from this hoard have yet been recorded. The number of these objects that may have been used as "money" can be reconstructed from Lombard's description. Of the total of 583 pieces of silver, 228 are jewelry, leaving 355 [not 3581] which are unshaped. Of these, 58 are coarse smelted and 22 silver ore, leaving a possible money total of 278 silver pieces (plus 8 pyramidal objects). Since the possible number of money objects'83 in this hoard is substantial, they should make good study subjects when weighed and sorted out. Richard N. Frye, "Bahrain under the Sasanians" (pp. 167-70). Frye's succinct account of the activities of Sasanians in the Gulf resumes the narrative of Bahrain's history after a hiatus of some nine centuries, and encompasses the period from the turn of the third to the end of the sixth century A.D. Frye's clearly set out summary makes it possible to move with comprehension to the concluding essay of the volume which concerns Nestorian bishoprics. It is indeed unfortunate that the volume lacks even a token recognition of the preceding Hellenistic period, which is becoming of ever increasing importance for an understanding of Gulf history. Frye reminds us that the florescence of the northwestern caravan cities such as Palmyra in the beginning of the period reflects a healthy laissez- faire policy on the part of the Parthians toward the Gulf ports providing goods from the east. For the still unidentified Gerrha, one can select from Hofuf, al-Qatif, or al-Hajar. Ardashir crossed the Gulf to conquer a territory identified later as al-Khatt; according to the geographer Yaqut it includes specifically al-Qatif, al-'Uqair, and Qatar. The inscription of Shapur I at Naqshi-Rustam tells us that he ruled Mazun (Oman on both sides of the Gulf); Frye suggests that Bahrain was administered by Fars. The population of Bahrain as defined for this period consisted of tribes from the Yemen, the indigenous Bani Ijl, and Persians from Fars. 183. One might consider the possibility that the objects represent part of a jeweller's hoard. References to various jewellers' hoards can be found in Martha R.

Shapur's resettlement policies may to some extent account for historical confusion of tribal and district toponyms. In the Lakhmid period Bahrain was under the administration of al-Hira in Iraq. Frye suggests that an Arab governor and Iranian military commander controlled Bahrain in conjunc- tion. However, as Frye indicates, the sequence of events in this period is by no means clear. Joelle Beaucamp and Christian Robin, "L'6vech6 Nestorien de Mash- mafig dans l'archipel d'Al-Babrayn (Ve-IXe siecle), (pp. 171-96). In this very fine and erudite essay the authors trace the spread of Nestorian Christianity in the immediate region of Bahrain and the Eastern Arabian province. The complexities of toponymic identification are immense, but finally we are convinced that Hofuf is Hagar, Qatif is Hatta, Tarut is Dayrin, Mashmahig/Samahig is Bahrain [Muharraq], and the exact location of Talun remains uncertain. The authors proceed to detail the history of these Nestorian communities utilizing all available sources, contemporary and modern. Finally three stelae from the island of Muharraq are possibly associated with the early Christian church which is believed to have been established there. This essay constitutes an admirable concluding note for the volume under review. ADDITIONAL NOTES I.

"In Ur she left the temple of Dilmun" (Inanna's Descent, line 9b)s'8; 2. "In Ur Edilmuna belongs to me" (VAS 10 199 iii 32,189 a hymn in which the goddess, speaking in the first person, gives a partial listing of her temples); 3. "The house of Dilmun is your first hostel in Ur" (OECT 1 151 iii 8)190; 4. Lamentation Text 1 from Tello refers to the destruction of E- dilmuna'9I; 5. Lamentation Text 2 from Tello: "In Ur my temple Edilmuna is destroyed."'12 The fact that Warad-Sin mentions the restoration of the shrine leads us to assume that its origins are at least Neo-Sumerian in date. The sup- plementary texts cited from sites such as Tello and Warka list the Dilmun shrine with others like Eanna at Uruk, thus suggesting that Ishtar's temple at Ur may also have antedated the twentieth century. However, no architectural candidate has yet been proposed there. DIGEST OF EVIDENCE The notes which follow constitute a preliminary attempt to establish our current position in the study of Dilmun.

Gulf - (Ubaid 3/4 only represented at these sites) Eastern Arabia: al-Markh on Bahrain, Ras Aburak on Qatar, Kuwait; Ubaid 2 is represented at Halili (Bushire) in Iran. Interpretation Most scholars would agree that the basic material culture as reflected in the myths is that known archaeologically from the Ubaid period. The many elaborations in these literary compositions are only indicative of the period in which the stories were actually recorded in clay. It seems likely that as the waters rose, reaching a peak ca. 5000 B.C. (4-5 m.) and filling the Shatt al-Arab valley, the populations were forced to safer shores. Their distribution in Ubaid times clearly fans around the top of the Gulf. It is not surprising that these people were not only aware of each other but also remained in contact. Nor is it difficult to comprehend why the "high center" of this civilization developed in Sumer, where the agricultural possibilities were particularly seductive, as the temperature climbed to achieve a sub-tropical zenith in the following Uruk period, about 3500 B.C. It is also clear from the myths that Enki in the Marshlands was a benefactor of Dilmun. Dilmun was not located precisely there, but was somewhat removed from Sumer proper, yet always within communicable distance.

Interpretation Information from texts, especially that concerning the tax collectors, identifies an area associated with the Tigris, the border, and two other places. Ration/distribution lists name persons from the place Dilmun. Copper is mentioned as obtained from Dilmun; this dictates a contact by sea. We have archaeological evidence of contact between Mesopotamia and Magan (Oman and the United Arab Emirates) during the Late Uruk- Jamdat Nasr period. The Uruk-Jamdat Nasr settlements can be most easily distinguished by their ceramics. With the sole exception of Umm an-Nussi in the Jabrin Oasis, where Uruk material is of earlier vintage and may possibly be tied to Ubaid occupation, cultural continuity from Ubaid to Uruk is demonstrable only in Sumer. There are questionable ceramic links between eastern Arabia and Mesopotamia in the Uruk period and this pottery is so far not manifest elsewhere in the Gulf. The written record at this time points toward a Dilmun location near to, but east of, Sumer. Suffice it to say that a number of archaeologically unidentified mounds are concealed by the palm groves on the east banks of the Tigris and the Shatt al-Arab, according to local reports. EARLY DYNASTIC Texts Ebla Lists: Elam.ki and Dilmun.ki are listed as foreign countries; products of Dilmun are cited as tin, copper, harp, Dilmun tree, beer- bread'a3; mention of the Dilmun shekel in transactions via Mesopotamia. Lagash texts: Dilmun ships brought wood from "mountain lands"; copper ore came from Dilmun; costumes of Dilmun linen were delivered to Urukagina's Queen; bronze models of Dilmun ships were used as votives; onions from Dilmun were stored in the "Treasure House."

Interpretation Of the three proposed locations for Dilmun in the early historic period, we can point to physical remains only in East Arabia. The ar-Raf'ah site produced not only rich imported material but evidence for the crafts of steatite, lapis, and possibly alabaster working, as well as copper metal- lurgy. The Arabian sites in the al-Hasa/Qatif region as well as the Jabrin Oasis display a significant quantity of direct pottery imports and local imitations, not only of Mesopotamian ceramics but wares from Bampur, Umm an-Nar, and Oman. About 2750 B.C. the sea level was up 2-3 m., the marshes of southern Iraq expanded, and one might with justification presume that water travel was prevalent. The Dilmunites may have remained east of the Tigris at this time, but their ships surely ranged Gulf waters. The mention of both Dilmun tin and the Dilmun standard of weight indicates that the basis for economic collaboratoin between Dilmun and Melubba was already well-established in the mid-third millennium. The existence of this collaboration is inescapable on the grounds of textual evidence, but is very difficult to support in material terms. The implied sophistication in international affairs would be far easier to accept in the Ur III period.

(ill-defined). Interpretation The absence of material relative to Dilmun during the Old Akkadian period creates an astonishing hiatus. Where is Dilmun? Where do the ships come from? Even if Dilmun were still located east of the Tigris, the transfer to a new site in the Gulf would no doubt be forced by the incursions of the Gutu at the end of the Akkadian period. Both Naram-Sin and Manishtusu apparently dealt directly with Magan. Neither mentioned Dilmun as a factor in the Gulf. The population inhabiting Bahrain were burying their dead in tumuli, whose contents include local ceramic wares for the most part, and also an occasional trace of imported Umm an-Nar (Magan) type pottery. UR III Texts Six economic texts refer to rations for Dilmun workers. Drehem: two texts concerned with a meal for Martu and diviners coming from Dilmun. Isin: Texts involving shipments of leather to Dilmun. Ur: Warad-Sin cone describes the restoration of a Dilmun Temple dedicated to Ishtar. Archaeological Bahrain: Barbar Temple (?

Interpretation The Neo-Sumerian period in Mesopotamia is characterized by a return to old Sumerian values expressed in monumental architecture, pious art, and copious literature. These manifestations were based on sound business practices, with considerable emphasis on foreign trade. Although we do not presently have a Mesopotamian archive to document the role of Dilmun in this exchange, it is clear that the cultural impact reached Bahrain, where we can demonstrate the development of well-built stone temples and sacred wells, prosperous habitation levels in a city, and the ancient world's largest graveyard. The original stimulus for the establish- ment of Enki-related features in the religious buildings may have come</page><page sequence="52">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 105 from Eridu, and/or Ur. The association of Ur with Dilmun in religious tradition is confirmed by several texts; the most explicit is a clay cone of Warad-Sin who restored Edilmuna, the Sanctuary of Inanna at Ur.1'5 The internal prosperity of Bahrain was based initially on a rich but limited agricultural potential in the northern part of the island. That a contact was already established with Magan is attested by grave goods from the tumuli. It was but a short step for Dilmun to assume the lead in the copper trade. The incidental occurrence of one Mesopotamian cylinder seal on Failaka (and possibly some pottery) may indicate only that ships occasion- ally broke the 400 km. journey on the Bahrain-Mesopotamia route. There are no discernible traces of a settlement on the island for this period.

These materials were not only commercial items, but also occurred in the form of gifts, donations, letters, and personal equipment or other paraphernalia. For purposes of this review an attempt has been made to limit the Dilmun discussion to the upper half of the Gulf, where the Dilmun concentration is more intense. Nevertheless, attention must be called to the Harappan type weights from Qala'at al-Bahrain City 2 (which should be the same system as that recognized as the "Dilmun" standard at Ebla in the third millennium), reminding us that the Gulf and Indus Valley operated on one measurement standard and Mesopotamia on another. As discussed in connection with Powell's essay, since the third quarter of the third millennium caravans, boats, and ships have been lucratively engaged in plying the trade routes from northern Afghanistan to the shores of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In the Isin-Larsa period Mesopotamian pottery and local imitations are found in Bahrain and Failaka, but seem not to be represented in Eastern Arabia. The open air platform temple on Failaka was probably established at this time, enabling crews from passing ships to make offerings just 80 km. from the Shatt al-Arab. It has been suggested that the numerous incom- plete soft-stone bowls with pictorial carving found in the F-3 tell are representative of these donations. Since a number of these fragments have exact parallels found in stratified context in Mesopotamia,'98 it is im- possible that they originated in Failaka, but might possibly have been carried in from an earlier temple elsewhere. Unfortunately our knowledge of the Dilmun Temple at Ur is limited to cuneiform sources. The inscriptional evidence establishes that the platform temple on Failaka was dedicated to Inzak and perhaps Enki as well, while Ninsikilla is not entirely forgotten. Because of the number of inscriptions recovered it seems likely that Failaka was populated directly from Mesopotamia. Despite the marvelous collection of Early Dynastic-related soft stone vessel fragments from Tarut Island, Eastern Arabia must be excluded from our consider- ation because of the lack of any material evidence for this period. The prominent role of Failaka in the production of Gulf stamp seals at this time is supported by a vast array of bronze and copper engraving tools from the excavations, especially the bar of a miniature drill pump identified by Drs. Ciarla, Qualls, Tosi, and Vidale. Although there is no 196. According to Dr. Lamia al-Gailani Werr, Kuwait National Museum Exhibit Con- sultant.</page><page sequence="54">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 107 overt evidence for the fashioning of the numerous soft-stone bowls, it is conceivable that the decoration may have been added there.'97 This would be especially relevant in the case of a later pictorial style ("Failaka Unique"'9s'. The stamp seals themselves seem to have been produced in a 300 year time span beginning ca. 2000 B.C.'99 This tallies well with the date of the stamped tablet dated to 1923 B.C. in the reign of Gungunum of Larsa. We now know that there are extended relationships for the Gulf seals, although in this review it is necessary only to mention three Gulf or Gulf type seals at Susa and an impression on the Tem-Inzak tablet.200 As Vallat indicates, the evidence for strong commercial ties between Dilmun and Susa are lacking because both trade termini were in the same business. A glyptic inter-relationship is demonstrated also between Bahrain--Failaka- Mesopotamia--Luristan--Turkmenistan--the Indus. The question of Amorites as components of the Dilmun community can be treated briefly as follows: (1) A tablet containing a list of four Amorite names in a City 2 level at Bahrain. The circumstances of its discovery as so far published do not satisfy the requirements of archaeological docu- mentation. (2) A tablet impressed with a Gulf seal, naming Tem-Inzak, "... considered a Dilmunite" and ". . . persons with typical Amorite names""201 was excavated at Susa. (3) A steatite bowl excavated at Failaka bears an Amorite name. (4) In the previous period a Drehem text mentions that some Amorites with some diviners coming from Dilmun are expected for dinner. All this really tells us is that Amorites are inveterate travellers- harking back no doubt to their nomadic antecedents. These should be the descendants of the Amurru who infiltrated Mesopotamia in Neo-Sumerian times; they may be participants in trading ventures, or are perhaps involved in some "messenger" capacity.202 Pettinato203 tells us that the third millennium texts from that kingdom are filled with references to 'mes- sengers' whose actual functions are never clarified. In the early second millennium 'messengers' are continuously in action 'to-ing and fro-ing' and judging from the Mari correspondence are frequently treated with great courtesy. 197. According to Drs.

The political atmosphere must have been refreshingly free of hampering restrictions. OLD BABYLONIAN Texts "Enlil and Ninlil: The Marriage of Sud" refers to baskets of Dilmun dates; unknown provenance: copper from Dilmun and Alashiya; Mari: references to the town of Tilmun, messengers from Tilmun, and the king of the town of Tilmun (a guest at the Mari court); Bahrain: Captain Durand's "foot"; Isin: shipments of leather goods to Dilmun; "Victory stela of Zimri- Lim": mentions town of Tilmun; temple cattle pasture between Eridu and marshes-possible Dilmun settlement; Failaka: inscriptions quoted for Isin-Larsa are equally possible for the Old Babylonian period ("Old Babylonian epigraphic" = 1950-ca. 1500). Archaeological Bahrain- Intermediate and Late Tumuli (burial complexes?); destruc- tion of Barbar Temple III (beginning of period); hiatus between Qala'at City 2-City 3. Failaka: Metallurgy; grand religious architecture in Tell F-6; traces of an administration building under F-6 extant building which is principally Kassite; houses in F-3 temple mound of random stone architecture; Old Babylonian pottery relationships. Interpretation The evidence cited above gives a strange configuration indeed. In Bahrain there is a hiatus in occupation at Qala'at; the last phase (III) of the Barbar Temple was destroyed at the end of the Isin-Larsa period, yet tumuli of the later group continue to be constructed. In Failaka the development of bronze metallurgy appears to have bred prosperity. The sacred architecture in the F-6 Tell, currently under excavation by the French, must certainly belong in this period; and one of the two sacred buildings should correspond in date to a more substantial administrative building underlying the two-phase extant Kassite construc- tion. Pottery from the Failaka tells has parallels and related forms in the Old Babylonian ceramic repertoire of Mesopotamia. The lower strata of occupation around the platform temple doubtlessly are associated with this period. The religious inscriptions listed for the previous period are equally at home here. The so-called "Old Babylonian" epigraphic style</page><page sequence="56">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 109 endures from early Isin-Larsa until nearly the end of the Kassite domina- tion. The textual sources from Mesopotamia are enigmatic. In speaking of copper from Alashiya (Cyprus) and Dilmun, do they refer to Failaka alone? Is there an Old Babylonian settlement in Bahrain not yet identified? The inscription referring to the "palace of Rimun" on Captain Durand's "foot" would support such a conjecture. And from whence come "Dilmun dates packed in baskets, dark-colored date clusters"?204 Merchants in Isin may still be actively engaged in shipping leather goods to Dilmun. It seems possible that a settlement (trading colony, karum) existed in mainlaind Iraq in the open region south of the Euphrates. Otherwise there is difficulty in explaining the reference to the "town" of Tilmun in the archives at Mari.205 In the wake of Hammurabi's subjugation and ultimate destruction ,of Mari, it may well have been expedient to establish such an entrep6t.

M. Civil, JAOS 103 (1983) 60:120. 205. It should be stressed here that there would have been three obvious routes of communication from Failaka to north-west Mesopotamia: (1) via the Shatt al-Arab and up the Euphrates, (2) via the Khor Bubiyan and the former branch of the Euphrates which ran south from the middle Euphrates area, and (3) overland north from the Bay of Kuwait.

Expanded building and reconstruction by Kurigalzu I and his successors in Babylonia must fall in the last quarter of the 15th century, and their extended influence in the Gulf should date around 1400 B.C. As Larsen points out,206 the decrease in rainfall in the early second millennium caused conditions of extreme aridity in Arabia, affecting Bahrain as well, between 1400-1100 B.C. Larsen is probably quite correct in suggesting that Bahrain's economy was based upon internal production of dates rather than the export-import of more exotic commodities. In Bahrain the architecture consists of large Kassite buildings in Qala'at (to which the inhabitants appear to have returned), among which is a large warehouse, presumed to be for the storage and processing of dates and their products. In Failaka the remains consist of an administrative building with two phases of construction in the same alignment. Similar con- struction techniques are apparent in the upper levels in the domestic quarter adjacent to the platform temple in the F-3 tell. Cist graves covered in huge lots rather than separate tumuli in the al-Hajjar burial fields in the northern part of Bahrain suggest some decline in prosperity, although there is now some hint that the burial complexes continue in this period. The unmistakable forms of Kassite pottery, particularly the footed flask, are well represented on both islands; they are noted by this reviewer to be identical with that from the storage depot at Aqar Quf; the Ur collections in Baghdad, London, and Philadelphia; and the Nippur material in Phila- delphia. The Kassite cylinder seals with their fine prayers, the four inscriptions mentioning Marduk, patron deity of Babylon, and the others with Adad and Enki indicate that some Mesopotamians may actually have resided in Failaka. This impression was buttressed by the fact that a number of Mitannian cylinder seals and other ornaments in glass and quartz faience were also recovered in the excavations. However Dilmun as a place may yet be segmented because the "Cornwall Letters" were in the form of reports apparently written by a Mesopotamian official in Dilmun to his superior in Nippur. It does not seem likely that the starving Ahlamu nomads would cross to an island to raid the date plantations. Much more appropriate would be a location somewhere on the mainland in east northeast Arabia where Kassites, Ahlamu, and Dilmunites must have been in intermittent contact between 1400 and 1200 B.C. 206.

Interpretation As Weidner sagely observed about other epithets of Tukulti-Ninurta I claiming victories "as far as the border of Makan," Assyrian scribes simply attached names of unknown and distant lands to the epithet, with little regard for veracity or relevance. Michalowski207 terms this "scribal bombast." Melubba was certainly not in Assyria's economic or political orbit at this time. Like the glass and faience cylinder seals and ornaments in the Kassite levels on Failaka, button base drinking cups were prevalent in Assyria proper in the fourteenth or thirteenth centuries, indicating continuing contacts between Babylonia and Failaka. Certain of the elevated beach terraces in Kuwait Bay have been dated to about 1250 B.C.208 indicating generally higher waters in the upper reaches of the Gulf, thus simplifying access to the Sealands and such sites as Tell el-Lahm (which was continuously inhabited from Early Dynastic times until the first millennium).

Interpretation The archaeological focus for this period comes to rest in Bahrain where the cultural remains reflect the activities of a well-to-do and organized society. A Dilmun colony or town of some type clearly existed in southern Iraq to the west of Babylonia, Chaldea, and the Sealands. It is also evident that the Assyrians were fully aware of both the Bahrain Dilmun as a kingdom, and the Iraq Dilmun as a town.210 NEO-BABYLONIAN Texts Failaka: fragment of bronze vessel; stone door sill. Archaeological Bahrain: City 4 silver hoard; Al-Hajjar burials: bathtub sarcophagi and identifiable pottery forms Failaka: one or two fragmentary items from Tell Khaznah.211 Interpretation The lack of material in Failaka between the Kassite and the Hellenistic periods implies that there was again no settled population on the island. The Hellenistic buildings were constructed on virgin soil over Bronze Age structures of the early second millennium. The lure of the Bronze Age temple may have continued to attract pious transients, whose debris is liberally distributed throughout the adjacent FH-2 area.212 Either this motivation, or the sudden voracious winter storms causing ships to seek harbor sanctuary, should account for the fragment of a bronze vessel dedicated to Shamash, the patron deity of Larsa. A similar chance occurrence must account for the stone door sill intended for the "Palace of Nebuchchadnezzar, King of Babylon," which had apparently been quar- ried further down the Gulf.213 Other random items strengthen this impression. 210.

HELLENISTIC In this period all of the earlier segments of Greater Dilmun are revived and expanded in new forms. The original motivation for the Greek interest in this part of the world can be traced to Alexander's insatiable "curiosity" about what lay between Egypt and Persia. After that it is all a matter of history. In Eastern Arabia, Thaj has produced coins, sculpture, Attic Black- Glaze, and Aramaic inscriptions. At Ain Jawan the cemetery as known so far dates very late, mostly Parthian. Gerrha, reputedly the richest city of all, has as yet not been identified. Failaka boasts a fortress with two stone temples within, two other shrines nearby, houses, a local ceramic industry, coin hoards, lamps, terracottas, bronzes, and the other accoutrements of Hellenistic civili- zation. Bahrain has no defined Hellenistic architecture at Qala'at, but this deficiency may be remedied by the discovery in the spring of 1985 of a late (Hellenistic-Parthian) temple. Graves at Hajjar and Janussan contained certifiable Hellenistic goods. Coins and ceramics were found at Qala'at. SASANIAN The Gulf ports continued to flourish, providing goods from the Orient for the caravan trade, but here our knowledge is derived solely from Persian historical sources, as well as a temple and burial on Bahrain.

SUMMARY CHART The inevitable conclusion to which the digest of sources concerning Dilmun leads is that the geographical entity "Dilmun" was not located in the same place at all times for which we have evidence for the term. The following chart illustrates the various possibilities for different periods of Gulf history in the blocks which are set in bold face type. For the most part this compilation is based on direct tangible evidence. Only in the case of the first four periods is the projection derived from reasoned inference from texts. With the exception of the Ubaid period, these texts are contemporaneous in date to the periods in question. For the Ubaid period the textual evidence is indirect: it is the consensus of senior Sumerologists that the earliest myths describe a culture which seems to be reflected in the archaeological remains of the Ubaid period. The manifestation of Early Dynastic culture in Eastern Arabic is as yet scarely known. There are definite ceramic links with cultures of both Mesopotamia and the United Arab Emirates, but so far the archaeological</page><page sequence="62">DILMUN: AT SEA OR NOT AT SEA? 115 evidence does not suggest the rather sophisticated society described in contemporary Mesopotamian texts. There are no extant written sources. The situation in the Akkadian period continues to be murky, lightening only slightly at the very end of the period with the appearance in Bahrain of a population which constructed burial mounds and also engaged in commercial and other international relations. There is firm evidence for Dilmun in the Isin-Larsa period at Bahrain and Failaka, and, somewhat less intensively, on the Eastern Arabian littoral. In the Old Babylonian period Bahrain drops out of the picture, except for continuing burials, but the scene on Failaka was bursting with vitality. Economic and diplomatic texts suggest that there may have been Dilmun merchants, or perhaps a trading post, in southern Iraq. During the entire period which is called Kassite in Mesopotamia (ca. 1600-1100), Dilmun culture is strongly represented in all aspects in both Bahrain and Failaka, and continues, apparently without interruption, well into the first millennium B.C. There is also continuing documentation for a Dilmun presence in east-northeast Arabia. In the Neo-Assyrian period a Dilmun "kingdom," which could feasibly be identified with City 4 in Bahrain, is recognized by Mesopotamians. A Dilmun "town," mentioned by the Assyrians, should be located in the sphere of southern Iraq. Failaka is devoid of datable remains of this time. When the Neo-Babylonians refer to a Dilmun, this must be to Bahrain, where the level of prosperity persists at a reasonably high standard; Failaka was reduced to not much more than a praying place, to judge from the scant remains of a pre-Hellenistic sanctuary at Tell Khazneh.</page><page sequence="63">SUMMARY CHART PERIOD EAST ARABIA BAHRAIN KUWAIT/FAILAKA SOUTH IRAQ Ubaid Ubaid 1-4 Ubaid 3-4 Ubaid 3-4 Ubaid 3-4 Textual evidence inter- preted: Dilmun east of Shatt Uruk/Jamdat Nasr Mesopotamian pottery?
