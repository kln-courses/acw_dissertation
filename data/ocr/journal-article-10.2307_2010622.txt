THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS AN OUTLINE OF COSMIC HUMANISM IN a former paper in this JOURNAL1 the writer outlined an hypoth- esis of absolute experience, suggesting here and there a philos- ophy of "cosmic humanism" which, if worked out, might redeem American philosophy from its present level of brute pragmatism and unromantic realism. If only the master pragmatists would suppress their endless essays in defense and definition of their method! All but the most stiff-necked and unregenerate of the younger English- writing philosophers have long ago adopted the pragmatic method, but now stand amazed and dismayed to find their masters indulging themselves in the sin of elaboration and analysis. This abuse of the "method of definition" is the natural vice of rationalism. It were better that the pragmatists applied their energies to cultivating the world-ground which they have already wrested from their hered- itary foes. The world-ground lies fallow, awaiting the hand and will of an expert. Meanwhile it may be well to offer, as a stimulant and irri- tant, an outline of the world-view which in his former paper the writer described as "cosmic humanism." I The pragmatist has on his hands a world-ground. What shall he make out of it? There is a certain pusillanimity in the present attitude of pragmatism. The Promethean boldness of rationalism's world-views may well have staggered the gods. But now their divine amazement is tempered with heavenly mirth by the spectacle of a wil-philosophy which yet does not dare to press beyond the limits of tedious definition and timid, "on-the-whole" hypotheses. The his- tory of earlier pragmatisms with their homo mensura sophisms makes it certain that, unless pragmatism produces a man who shall measure the very cosmos by himself, the movement begun so potently and promisingly a few years ago will prove as evanescent as a passing breeze. The pragmatist theory has never yet been genuinely tested. 'Vol. IV., pp. 176-183. The present paper was read before the American Philosophical Association at its recent meeting in Baltimore, December 29- 31, 1908.</page><page sequence="2">58 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Such a test would require that the, so far, rather sterile pragmatic philosophy were incubated for a while in the self-same cosmic matrix wherein the seeds of rationalism have hitherto germinated and flour- ished. What sort of world-view is the pragmatic passion likely to breed if it thus germinates and produces its kind on a cosmic scale? Its offspring must be in some sense a world-view. In this matter the pragmatist must recognize the validity and persistency of the human spirit's search for something universal and eternal. Such a search has indubitably had its functional value in the growing ex- perience of the race, and must, therefore, by the pragmatic test be recognized as helping to constitute the living truth. What, then, is this perfect passion for universals and eternals? Has it the validity of a world-forming, world-creating principle? Is it merely a pas- sion? Perhaps the passion itself is the one universal thing in the world? Does it connect, or disconnect, the human from the cosmic? Is it the whimpering and wailing of a soul in an incurable agony of finiteness? Or is it the terrific will force of an Ubermensch claiming his birthright as an aristocrat of the universal life? It may well be that a painstaking critique of this old-fashioned passion for the eternal and universal will expose impulses out of which pragmatism itself may organize a view of the world covering in principle the whole ground of reality. It is certain that, whatever the eternal is, it is not of the nature of ideas. The prime fallacy of rationalism arises from its failure to distinguish between the function and the content of an eternal im- pulse. The region in which the self acknowledges a universal a priori quality in its processes is, as the literature, of speculative mysticism attests, a region of transempirical consciousness. Wherever the mystic experience has divulged a content of ideas, these can be shown to be preconceptions subconsciously stored away in the mystic's past experience. The pure function of consciousness in this transem- pirical region has the imperative, eternal, universal quality just because it has no empirical content. It is a pure function; its uncer- tain content, the irreducible contradiction between ideas and will, has always been regarded by the first-class pessimist as an unmitigated evil. It can not be affirmed that this pure function is inwardly diversi- fied into fourteen forms of experience, more or less. Here, again, the evidence of speculative mysticism must be trusted. The per- sistent characteristic of the pure mystic experience is its spaceless- ness, timelessness, causelessness. For some years the writer has experimented in this mystic region, but has been unable to identify in the experience, e. g., of time, as infinite, any quality that distin- guishes it from space, as infinite. The experience in both cases is</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 59 one of perfect fluentcy without ideational content. The infinite as well as the infinitesimal space-experience begins to "swim" or "shiver" as consciousness verges upon the abysmal. These are the habitual expressions by which my subjects have sought to symbolize the perfect fluency of the universal and eternal quality in the experi- ence of space and time. And this which is true of the infinitudes of the pure reason is equally true of the infinitudes of the practical. Who can uncover, say, in wisdom, as infinite, a quality that isolates it from goodness, as infinite? In the wisdom literature from Plato to Emerson these, terms of practical infinitude are constantly interchanged and inter- fused. The eternal goodness is in all points wise: the universal wisdom is in all directions good. In the mystic experience neither goodness nor wisdom has any ideational content. The first principle of cosmic humanism confronts us here. What- ever may be in detail the defects of the world-view herein outlined, this first principle I hold to be indefeasible: "infinite" when attached to any substantive whatsoever is the sign of a contentless, formless function of experience. A self-organism, whether human or cosmic, is fundamentally finite on the side of its empirical content. There is no such thing in man or cosmos as an infinite idea. The writer's former thesis in cosmic humanism is, therefore, not guilty of begging the question between pragmatism and rationalism in affirming that there must be even in a world-experience a region of absolute subconsciousness the infinity of which is purely func- tional. We may grant, with philosophers like Leibnitz and Hart- mann, the hypothesis of an unending, unconscious fecundity in the world-ground. The cosmic life may be in an incomparable degree teeming with germinating ideas and wills. We are driven, neverthe- less, by the most fundamental structure of our own organisms of experience to presuppose a formless function underlying all these countless half-conscious impulses, ideas, and passions of the world- ground. In its first principle cosmic humanism is thus aligned with specu- lative mysticism rather than with rationalism. It acknowledges in the world-ground an "infinite tendency" rather than a well-ordered and self-representative structure of eternal and universal ideas. II In its second principle this cosmic application of the pragmatic method must transfer to the world-ground another ingrained feature of the human organism of experience; namely, the instinctive coor- dination of blind impulses into a consistent organism of vital experi- ence. The pure function of consciousness does, in fact, take on a</page><page sequence="4">60 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY living content; the unconscious does become conscious; the simple fluency of primal consciousness does become dirempted by warring wills and ideas. The prenatal bareness of animal experience does fructify with the passing years. The cosmic function has evolved a cosmos with the passing ages. Now, is this a fructification into con- sciousness of unconscious idea or of unconscious will? Here, again, the bias of rationalism must yield under the test of experience. This test has already shown us that the inmost structure of consciousness excludes the notion of a divine mind full of an infinite number of infinite ideas and forms. But rationalism might justly intervene at this point with the sentimental contention with which throughout its history it has gripped the race of men. Putting aside all metaphysical claims with respect to the ideas of the eternal and universal, this pure sentiment of rationality simply claims that at any rate the motives of the cosmic life are always ideational rather than impulsive, calm rather than passionate. The sole aim of world- experience is to arrive at an eventual, inner harmony of its ger- minating ideas, to subject all wills to this ideal of consistency and smoothness of being. In a word, the prime aim of experience is to become reasonable. If this final defense of rationalism is an argument for the primacy of ideas as against impulses, its argument can not claim the support of experience. On the contrary, nothing is more certain than the primacy of the impulsive phase of consciousness. The consciousness of single-celled animals is fundamentally motor; likewise the prenatal consciousness of the higher animals. In these two cases no idea whatever (except, perhaps, sensations of pressure and warmth) can be present in the organism's inner experience; and yet the very signs are motor by which the psychologists infer that they are conscious at all. Or, again, in idiocy and senile dementia, where consciousness approaches once more its primal state, the last functions that linger above the threshold are not ideational, but motor. In "absolute" idiocy there still remains a vegetating activity; in dementia the first functions to disappear or become confused are ideational, and in the last stages an impulsive activity continues long after it becomes only too painfully apparent that all control from ideational centers has ceased. With scrupulous regard for the structure of known organisms of experience, cosmic humanism is thus able to take a second step in its construction of world-experience. It now conceives that experience to be an infinite, totally subconscious function whose first steps in world-experience are impulsive rather than ideational. No matter how persistently a world-soul may in its present constitution be aim- ing at inward reasonableness, in its beginning it had no idea where or</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 61 how its activity was coming out. Like every other organism of experience, it just became, it just grew! In this matter cosmic ex- perience is again comparable with the mystic passion which desires an infinite number of things, and yet has no idea what these things are. The cosmic passion may be eternal, the cosmic idea is inherently temporal. III These initial impulses arising blindly within the formless and fluent infinity of world-consciousness have undergone coordinating, organizing, and hardening processes. In the present state of the cosmos the average observer will be very reluctant to accept any doc- trine of the present plasticity of cosmic stuff. In this matter of plasticity the materialist now has the weight of evidence in his pan of the scales. The patent fact is that, except within very narrow limits indeed, things are not plastic under our processes of practical reac- tion. By overdoing its hypothesis of the perfect plasticity of the world-ground, humanism might easily fall into the pathetic fallacy of absolute idealism. On the clear ground of known experience the humanist may insist (a) that the cosmos conceived as world-experi- ence must be inwardly a pure function, and (b) that in its initial processes of growth it was an inchoate matrix of perfectly plastic yet blind impulses-to-be. But it can not be urged on the same ground that world-experience in its present state is thus blindly and per- fectly fluent. World-impulses, whatever they may be in their in- ward, primeval character, are now outwardly fixed and hardened. Does, then, the structure of cosmic humanism fall to pieces be- cause one can not by taking thought pinch off a cubit of world-stuff and plaster it on his own head, nor by praying make the sun stop in its course? There is a certain merit in the criticism of one of prag- matism's doughty opponents who declares that the theory is designed solely for the man who needs to get out of a scrape. But the apparent bathos of pragmatism at this point arises solely from a failure to fit the structure of human experience fully into the cosmic scheme. For it is true of human experience, not only that it has this inner and initial plasticity, but also that in its adult form it has stiffened and hardened into all sorts of physical fixtures. In our own organisms there exist innumerable physical processes which are only subcon- sciously felt and are ordinarily wholly uncontrolled from higher centers. In both its phylogenetic and ontogenetic origin this human experience began, we may fairly suppose, as a plastic feeling-con- sciousness of the total organism: the plastic simplicity of the con- sciousness of the single-celled animal and of the freshly impregnated fetus is paralleled in each case by the plasticity and simplicity of the</page><page sequence="6">62 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY organism itself. But with the inward formation of physical systems each discharging a fixed function in the evolving organism there pro- ceeded likewise, on the side of consciousness, a certain subconscious hardening of physical consciousness; e. g., feelings of visceral massiveness, of joint and muscle strains, of physical weight, hardness, and the like. Humanism, disabused of any metaphysical hypothesis of cosmic plasticity, should propose at this point an hypothesis of cosmic, phys- ical subconsciousness. In brief, two postulates are involved in the fundamental structure of physical experience. (1) The physical universe has originated not by the fully conscious control of some eternal intelligence, but, rather, through a hardening into objective being of the unconscious, organic needs of the impulsively evolving cosmos. (2) The physical universe is now felt in the cosmic life as so much pull and strain and dead weight.2 In a word, plasticity is no more a characteristic of cosmic than of human experience. IV On the other hand, the humanist metaphysic need not postulate a cosmic experience less plastic than the human. As we have just seen, the physical parts of an organism are felt. They are not inwardly and radically sundered from the region of conscious being; they are subconscious, but not unconscious. Moreover, within certain limits physical processes are subject to control from the higher motor cen- ters of the organism. Consciously controlled heart-beating, accel- erated or depressed circulation of the blood, voluntary bisecting of the viscera, the suggestive therapeutic reduction of inflammation in diseased parts, the psychic treatment of nervous and chronic diseases -these are cases in point. The evidence by no means proves the complete plasticity of the human organism under conscious control from higher centers; it does indicate, however, that there is in the conscious organism no inherent inability which would prevent the controlling of physical processes from volitional centers of the cosmic life. V The foregoing conclusions expose the marrow of the divinity within the dry bones of scholasticism. The genius of the schoolman is revealed and exhausted by his search for a necessarily permanent 2 I need hardly say that this transcription of physical subconsciousness from the human to the cosmic scale should not be carried to an anthropomorphic extreme. In the cosmic life there are, of course, no visceral feelings, no muscle and joint strains, and all that. At the most the cosmic physique feels in a universal degree the intracortical strains and the brain fatigue which assail the human life.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 63 principle underlying and pervading the shifting sands of being. And this is the lasting passion of all seekers after the universal and eternal. That such a principle is discoverable we have seen. It is in reality not a system of fixed and well-ordered concepts, but a pressure of conscious activity presupposed in all our processes of experience and felt even in the region of our subconscious, organic life. But the very process of analysis which discovers this active principle of all experience does not wholly satisfy the scholastic passion for an eternal whose existence is necessary. It is conceivable that the func- tion of consciousness even on a cosmic scale should cease to be active. There are cases of known organisms wherein the active, organizing principle has practically ceased to work. In absolute idiocy and coma the organism of experience seems to be slipping back into the abyss of totally unconscious non-being. Either because of a con- genital poverty of impulses-to-be, or through a fatiguing of these impulses, conscious activity seems about played out. If, now, we apply the norm of human to cosmic experience, we may admit the possibility of defectiveness and fatigue even in the cosmic organism. The persistency of the physical universe in the midst of its ceaseless flux of being must thus be interpreted partly as the natural healthi- ness of a great cosmic animal3 and partly as the conscious resistance of cosmic energy to the deranging forces of mental disease.4 The real existence of universal principles or laws is, therefore, to be regarded not as necessary, but rather as the achievement of a partly conscious and partly subconscious will-to-be in the cosmic life. VI It remains only to ward off a possible misunderstanding of the foregoing analysis of the world's absolutely subconscious matrix by explaining that this discussion of the "infinite" has no explicit refer- ence to the tender infinitudes of religious experience. To affirm that the absolutely subconscious has in itself a blind character which, as blind and unconscious, is strictly submoral, or to consider that this subconscious world-life has arrived at and is now consciously working out in its voluntary centers a personial character, or to submit the ground on which religious experience may justify its antagonism to positivism in claiming that this personal character is cosmic and not IA large part of the living truth is undoubtedly expressed in the cosmic animiism of Greek culture. See Plato's description of the world-soul as a " per- fect animal," "Timnus," 31. Cf. Aristotle: "Deity is an animal that is ever- lasting and most excellent in nature. . . . This constitutes the very essence of God," " Metaphysics," Book XI., 6. 4 Such resistance appears to fail, as we have seen, on the human plane in cases of idiocy and senile dementia and on the stellar plane in cases of " dying " comets.</page><page sequence="8">64 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY merely human-these questions the writer hopes to discuss at some future time in a paper dealing with " The Cosmic Character."
