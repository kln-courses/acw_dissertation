I will attempt this by asking two questions. First: how does Nietzsche establish an anthropomorphic feminine truth, and what is achieved by this metaphor? Second: what is Nietzsche's truth about woman? Through analysis of selected passages, I will argue that Nietzsche, through gendering truth, displays a conviction that what we believe to be true functions as such only when 'veiled'; the metaphor of a veiled woman named truth, I will argue, presents truth as something that retains its value insofar as the truth remains shrouded, distant and unexamined. With this first answer established, the second question will prove to be undermined by Nietzsche's numerous and at times ironic 'truths' about woman. I will argue that the diverse range of women in Nietzsche's texts problematises the possibility of a Nietzschean ambition to reveal woman in her true form. Moreover, I will claim that Nietzsche's critique of the dogmatic philosopher's 'will to truth' subverts the notion that Nietzsche intends to offer a sincere, 'unveiled', truth about woman. Geheimniszvoll am lichten Tag, Läszt sich Natur des Schleiers nicht berauben, Und was sie deinem Geist nicht offenbaren mag, Das zwingst du ihr nicht ab mit Hebeln und mit Schrauben (Goethe, Faust)1 Dark in daylight, Nature will not allow the Stripping of her veil, And what she chooses not to reveal to your mind, You will not seduce with lever and with bolts. Nietzsche's preoccupation with woman shows itself in his discussions of truth, his critique of the philosophical tradition, his distaste for feminism and his rejection of equal rights. His proclamations about the 'weaker sex' are notorious, and some of his more quotable remarks about woman appear Literature &amp; Theology © The Author 2008.

These comments pose a problem for the Nietzsche scholar, and can make it difficult to maintain that Nietzsche's work is relevant at a time when feminist discourse is established and respected. However Nietzsche's attitude towards woman holds a greater significance and has the potential to yield much more for the reader than a hermeneutical puzzle. The role that woman has to play in Nietzsche is an important part to understanding his broader claims about traditional philosophy and the value of truth. As we shall see, Nietzsche's critique of the tradition that preceded him is partly established through his discussion of woman. The intricacies of Nietzsche's critique of the philosophical tradition are developed through two such interrelated uses of woman. The first is his anthropomorphisation of truth; through examining the gendering of truth in Nietzsche, we can better understand his critique of the philosophical pursuit of this woman named truth. The second focuses not on a woman named truth, but on the truth of woman. At stake in this second enquiry is our reading of 'Weib-an-sich', a notion that is of paramount importance in its translation, meaning and application. If the first technique uses woman to reveal the mistakes of philosophy's will to truth, the second demonstrates in practice the shortcomings of the traditional philosophical enterprise. How then do we begin our examination of woman in Nietzsche? Perhaps we could take direction from Nietzsche himself. In the preface to Beyond Good and Evil, we are asked to imagine truth as a woman: Supposing truth is a woman — what then? Are there not grounds for the suspicion that all philosophers, insofar as they were dogmatists, have been very inexpert about woman?2 Nietzsche portrays the philosopher as a luckless suitor who lusts after a woman who 'has not allowed herself to be won'. The dogmatic philosopher is por trayed as a sad bumbling figure whose 'gruesome seriousness', 'clumsy obtru siveness' and adolescent awkwardness leave him unsuccessful. This rather pathetic figure is not only incompetent, but also impotent; his 'dogmatism is left standing dispirited and discouraged. If it is left standing at all'. Later Nietzsche goes further, to speculate that even if the dogmatist were able to rise to the task, 'probably he will be too 'short', for all fundamental problems of life... incapable of attaining any depth'.4 Nietzsche's characterisation of the traditional philosopher is far from complimentary. Unfortunately, it seems that Nietzsche's explicit instruction leads only to bawdy phallic puns. If we wish to pay significant respect to this topic, we must strive to understand Nietzsche's gendered anthropomorphised truth beyond ridicule of orthodox philosophy. Further questions must be asked of the myriad aphorisms dealing with woman, not just in Beyond Good and Evil</page><page sequence="3">MATTHEW BENNETT 315 but throughout Nietzsche's works. Why, for instance, does Nietzsche pro claim that 'life is a woman'? How are we to read his suggestion that 'perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not letting us see her reasons'? Why is Zarathustra asked to give his thoughts on woman? As we embark on a broader examination of the appearance of woman in Nietzsche, we will find that she is not just an opportunistic rhetorical device used to mock the impotence of traditional philosophy, but offers a more profound understand ing of Nietzsche's position. The search for further significance in Nietzsche's allusions to woman takes us deeper into his critique of the dogmatic philosopher. As noted above, Nietzsche's ridicule of the tradition implies that conventional philosophy has set itself a task that it is unable to complete. More specifically, Nietzsche attacks what he calls a 'will to truth' exhibited in philosophical orthodoxy.8 Traditional philosophy assumes 'for the more highly valued thing a miraculous source in the very kernel and being of the 'thing-in-itself'9; the tradition sets itself the task of revealing this 'miraculous source' or true nature of the world. Nietzsche's reference to the 'thing-in-itself echoes Kant's Ding-an-sich and invites an illuminating contextualisation of Nietzsche's opponent. Kant is a consistent target for Nietzsche; further allusions to Kant appear, among others, in Beyond Good and Evil10 and again in Section 3 of the 'History of an Error' in The Twilight of the Idols.11 Kant's answer to the problem of metaphysics is in fact paradigmatic of the philosophy Nietzsche attacks. 'Königsbergian' ontology differentiates the phenomenal world of our experi ence, composed of empirical objects, from a noumenal reality that transcends experience and is by definition unknowable. This 'two-world' opposition of phenomena and noumena is symptomatic of the dogmatic philosophy that Nietzsche objects to; it is an example of the tenacious insistence throughout the history of philosophy to maintain an ontological distinction between a 'real world' and an 'apparent world'. Even Kant, whose Copernican revolu tion was intended to end philosophy's preoccupation with transcendent rea lity, posited a vacuous notion of Ding-an-sich, and perpetuated the 'two-world' philosophy of his predecessors.12 Thus the dogmatic philosopher is impotent in the face of his self-appointed task: to reveal the 'thing-in-itself'. His obsession with a 'two-world' reality has led him to pursue an end that, according to Nietzsche, he is unable to reach. Why, then, does Nietzsche see traditional philosophy as a Sisyphean endeavour? This question will prove to be crucial to our understanding of Nietzsche's attitude towards woman and truth. Before attempting an answer, we must heed the concluding warning of the 'History of an Error': 'with the real world we have also abolished the apparent world!'12 Nietzsche does not achieve his departure from traditional metaphysics through rejecting one ontological category ('the real world') and clinging to another ('the apparent world').</page><page sequence="4">316 NIETZSCHE AND A WOMAN NAMED TRUTH Such a misunderstanding can lead to a horrendous mischaracterisation of his position. For example, Nietzsche's problematisation of 'incorporeal, eternal, "unchanging truth" ' has lead Catherine Zuckert to infer that meaning 'occurs and can only occur in an individual human being'.14 Such an individualist or existentialist reading of Nietzsche will only serve to erroneously simplify Nietzsche's epistemology and would mislead our own attempts to answer this vital question. Bearing his caution in mind, we can proceed to investigate Nietzsche's woman named truth and explain why the dogmatic philosopher fails to seduce her. To establish what Nietzsche achieves through gendering truth, we need to examine the qualities embodied in this woman. For some com mentators, accounting for the type or types of woman that appear in Nietzsche has proved a difficult task; there seem to be many conflicting and contradictory perspectives on woman throughout his work. Whilst at times we meet apparently derogatory descriptions of woman,15 at others Nietzsche exhibits admiration for her.16 Failure to comprehend woman's diversity in Nietzsche can lead to mis placed criticism. Christine Allen has understandably, though incorrectly, inter preted the variety of attitudes towards woman in Nietzsche as an ambivalence towards a single category of person. Allen identifies a marked difference between Nietzsche's opinion of strong women and weak women, yet follows this by claiming 'it is true to Nietzsche's style not to make distinctions between some women who are weak and some who are strong'.17 Allen's mistake, which we must take care to avoid, is to read Nietzsche as holding contra dictory opinions of a single object of investigation. The woman that Nietzsche espouses at one moment for her strength of will is not the same woman that he later criticises for being the weaker sex. It is important to follow on from commentators who have observed a variety of forms of woman in Nietzsche.18 This diversity displays an expansive array of characteristics that Nietzsche evaluates on their individual merits, rather than with reference to a universal or abstract category of woman. Maintaining one attitude towards one female character and a substantially different attitude towards another is neither contradictory nor ambivalent. To avoid mistaking Nietzsche's discus sion of woman for ambivalence we should recognise that it is a particular type of woman that he compares to truth, and we must resist the temptation to mistake all references to woman for discussions of gendered truth. What then are the characteristics that Nietzsche wishes to attribute to truth by way of this gendered anthropomorphism? How does Nietzsche portray the woman that evades the dogmatic philosopher? When we narrow focus upon the appearance of this particular woman named truth, we find that her role is established in terms of exposure, revelation and unveiling. Take for example Nietzsche's claim that 'science offends the modesty of all real women' in its</page><page sequence="5">MATTHEW BENNETT 317 drive to expose what lies 'under their dress and finery' and to 'peep under their skin.'19 Elsewhere he tells us that the most 'powerful magic of life' is its 'veil of beautiful possibilities', leading him to declare: 'Yes, life is a woman'20; whilst Zarathustra proclaims that 'Everything about woman is a riddle' and that her 'nature is surface, a changeable, stormy film upon shallow waters'.21 The connotations, in light of what we have established regarding Kant's exemplary 'two-world' philosophy, suggest that if truth is this particular kind of woman, she is the veiled, hidden noumenal world that the dogmatic philosopher has striven to seduce. The scientist works to expose not only what lies under the literal 'dress and finery' of woman, but wants to go further than a physical uncovering to 'peep under the skin'. This woman named truth is to be dissected in order for her nature to be examined and her 'riddle' to be solved. The personification of truth should not return us to the simplified reading of Nietzsche we discarded earlier; nor should it lead us to suggest that Nietzsche intends to divert philosophy from its project of uncovering to a discussion of 'mere appearance'. As discussed, Nietzsche's criticism of the philosophical will to truth does not result in a rejection of the 'real world' in favour of the 'apparent world'. We find additional evidence for this in the preface to The Gay Science: ... one will hardly find us again on the paths of those Egyptian youths who... want by all means to unveil, uncover, and put into a bright light whatever is kept concealed for good reasons. No, this bad taste, this will to truth, to 'truth at any price,' this youthful madness in the love of truth, have lost their charm for us... We no longer believe that truth remains truth when the veils are withdrawn: we have lived too much to believe this. Today we consider it a matter of decency not to wish to see everything naked, or to be present at everything, or to understand and 'know' everything.22 Nietzsche is critical of the adolescent pride of the 'youthful madness' that constitutes the 'will to truth'. This desire to lift the veil of truth is condemned for its immaturity and naivety. But one should not read Nietzsche's use of a recurrent theme of veiling, his critique of the will to withdraw this veil, and his unmitigated admiration held for the beauty of that veil, as indications that he is critical of the notion that something may lie beyond it. What is clear from the preface to The Gay Science, along with the gendering of truth and a theme of unveiling and exposure, is that Nietzsche is critical of a drive to 'unveil, uncover': a 'will to truth'. We must appreciate the important differ ence between criticising the 'will to truth' and denying truth altogether. How then are we to read Nietzsche's attitude towards truth, his metaphor of the veil and his image of a woman named truth? We have seen that Nietzsche is critical of the metaphysical tradition that preceded him;</page><page sequence="6">318 NIETZSCHE AND A WOMAN NAMED TRUTH yet his critique falls short of a complete denial of the concept of truth. Rather, I suggest, Nietzsche's complex relation to this woman named tmth concedes her value whilst rejecting the validity of a traditional philosophical project that aims to unveil her. Nietzsche does not deny the possibility of truth; nor does he deny its value and its important function. Ironically, Nietzsche criticises the will to tmth not for its strong belief in tmth, but for its destmctive impulse to reveal tmth. The goal of metaphysics is to investigate and expose the woman behind the veil, or the tmth behind the world of mere appearance. This goal is self-defeating, Sisyphean, in virtue of the fact that 'tmth [never] remains tmth when the veils are withdrawn'.23 The philosophical will to tmth, the dogmatic philosopher's desire to lift the veil of this woman named tmth, fails to appreciate that the tmth will no longer remain tme once it is disclosed. This invites one further question: why would this woman named tmth lose her veracity when unveiled? Precisely because her 'nature is surface',24 her action is at a distance25 and she is a 'woman who has reasons for not letting us see her reasons'.26 Tmth is valuable, and remains tme, so long as she remains assumed, unexamined, veiled and distant. Once under the scmtiny of the dogmatic philosopher, tmths become untenable, unravelled, exposed and are rendered false. Woman's veil has an irreducible dual nature; the superficial 'beautiful possibilities' He on the surface, along with the ever-present promise of the tmth beyond the veil. If the enticing promise of a beautiful shroud and the value of its concealed tmth are to persist, then we must mature into a modest restriction to our inquisitive philosophical 'will to tmth.' We cannot do away with the concept of tmth, and expect the veil of'mere appearance' to remain. Nor can we lift the veil, and expect tmth to conform to the expecta tions we held of it. Rather, it is through refraining from examining tmth that her veil, and the woman who hides behind it, persist. With a better understanding of Nietzsche's relation to tmth, we can tum our attention to Nietzsche's discussion of the tmth about woman. As we have established, Nietzsche's woman named tmth derives her value from her mod esty. The adolescent over exuberance of the dogmatic philosopher drove him to peep under her veil. Yet when we examine Nietzsche's exploration of the tmth of woman, do we not witness his own hypocritical will to tmth? If Nietzsche offers proclamations about woman, would he not be vulnerable to the same critique that he directed towards the dogmatic philosopher? Nietzsche's complex relation to the philosophical project of unveiling tmth deeply proble matises the way that the tmth of woman can manifest itself in his work. Let us remind ourselves, for instance, of Nietzsche's criticism of the scien tific investigation of woman: Science offends the modesty of all real women. It makes them feel as if one wanted to peep under their skin - yet worse, under their dress and finery.27</page><page sequence="7">MATTHEW BENNETT 319 This interrogation of woman goes beyond the physical; the scientist 'peeps under their skin' in order to expose an essence that is not just physical, but metaphysical. Nietzsche is no less critical of this will to the-tmth-of-woman when it is perpetrated by woman herself: Woman wants to become self-reliant - and for that reason she is beginning to enlighten men about 'woman-in-itself': this is one of the worst developments of the general uglification of Europe.28 ... the ascetic priest will hardly even be the most successful defender of his ideal — for the same reason that a woman tends to fail when she wishes to defend 'woman-in-itself.. ,.29 The feminist's goal of revelation is symptomatic of the philosophical will to truth 'at any price'.30 If the dogmatic philosopher strives to explicate truth, the dogmatic feminist strives to explicate woman in the same way. The wish to unveil the reality behind the mere appearance of woman is implicitly com pared to the projects of Kant, Plato et al., and her attempt to disclose woman in-itself is vulnerable to the same critique aimed at the dogmatic philosopher's desire to reveal the thing-in-itself. How then are we to account for Nietzsche's approach to the topic of woman without reading into his text a similar disclosure of woman-in itself? Exploring the truth of woman in Nietzsche's text seems to presume an aspect of Nietzsche's writing that could only be hypocritical. This dilemma is exacerbated by the diversity of forms woman takes in Nietzsche. As we have already mentioned, Nietzsche discusses a variety of types of woman; for every disparaging comment about her an expression of reverence and awe is given elsewhere. Yet our exploration of the truth of woman seems to demand that this broad spectrum of female images be brought together under one inves tigation. The difficulty posed for our reading transforms from the danger of reading a hypocritical will to truth into Nietzsche, to the problem of incor porating a wide variety of Nietzsche's themes under one examination. If our task is to understand Nietzsche's discussion of woman, then the lack of a consistent female character in his work could threaten the legitimacy of our project. When confronted with a heterogeneous object of enquiry, we may question the very validity of that enquiry. Perhaps we need to reflect briefly on the question we are asking. We have established how Nietzsche relates to a woman named truth; in light of this, we wish to explore Nietzsche's discussion of the truth of woman, i.e. what is true of woman? This will initially involve collating the aphorisms that deal with a common theme of woman. This is more problematic than we may have thought, given the diversity of personalities that are discussed with reference to woman. What then is the common element of the disparate passages</page><page sequence="8">320 NIETZSCHE AND A WOMAN NAMED TRUTH we aim to bring together in our interrogation? The problematic variance of our object of enquiry forces from us the most obvious answer: our investiga tion of Nietzsche's discussion of woman examines passages that refer to some thing that he calls 'woman', whatever that may be. In other words, we are interested in Nietzsche's uses of the linguistic item 'woman'. Our search for a stable basis for our question is now clutching at straws. However, even this desperate appeal to the fundamental linguistic function of 'woman' fails to establish a simple object of enquiry. Certainly, we can collect together each of Nietzsche's aphorisms that refer to 'woman' in the English translation. However, the original German poses further difficulties; even the most basic linguistic uniformity is undermined when we refer back to the original text. Nietzsche mostly refers to woman as das Weib, but at times will use die Frau. Take for example the following two lines from Zarathustra: A child is concealed in the true man: it wants to play. Come, women {Frauen), discover the child in man! Let woman {Weib) be a plaything, pure and fine like a precious stone illumined by the virtues of a world that does not yet exist.31 The notion of a uniform category of woman seems to be undermined in Nietzsche's discussion of Weib and Frau. Take as another example Section 239 of Beyond Good and Evil. Among a number of claims about das Weib ('woman is retrogressing'; 'woman's influence in Europe has decreased pro portionately as her rights and claims have increased'; 'what inspires respect for woman... is her nature') appears a single reference to Frau: 'the most powerful and influential women of the world... owed their power and ascendancy over men to the force of their will'. Contrasted with numerous derogatory comments about Weib, Nietzsche is curiously respectful of die Frau. We could be forgiven for reading this as ambivalence towards woman. However, as we discovered earlier, Nietzsche's alleged ambivalence need not be read as such; it is a failure to heed woman's plurality that leads to this inaccurate criticism. Our appreciation of woman's plurality is now creat ing a more profound difficulty. It seems that asking how Nietzsche discusses the truth of 'woman' may be begging the question; there is arguably no equivalent for this English term in the German idiom that Nietzsche wrote in, nor does there seem to be a common element to the various discussions of Weib and Frau. Should we not ask ourselves, following from Sarah Kofman, 'Is there for Nietzsche woman in herself?'3" As Kofman recognised, approach ing the question of woman in Nietzsche may set itself the impossible task of searching for an aspect of Nietzsche's texts that does not exist. We are struggling to find a coherent set of claims about woman, an account for what is true about her, an exposition of 'woman-in-itself. This struggle</page><page sequence="9">MATTHEW BENNETT 321 leads us to a crisis of confidence in our investigation; this crisis reveals that potential hypocrisy and inconsistency lies not in Nietzsche's text, but in our interpretation. We have established both that Nietzsche criticises a will to unveil truth and opposes the feminist project to reveal the truth about woman; yet we seek out a Nietzschean attempt to unveil and reveal woman. This endeavour seems to deny what we now know about Nietzsche's attitude towards truth. It also ignores textual evidence that Nietzsche himself is conscious of the irony of his discussion of the truth of woman. Take for example Section 231 of Beyond Good and Evil. This aphorism precedes an extensive passage dealing with woman, and offers a disclaimer: After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about 'woman in itself - assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only - my truths. Nietzsche acknowledges that, when addressing the question of woman, he will only 'discover ultimately how this is "settled in him" '. Nietzsche primes us for what will follow: his truths about woman. He deliberately undermines the possibility that he can (and moreover believes he can) speak about 'woman-in-itself'. The following nine aphorisms therefore appear as ironic attempts to disclose truths about woman. Walter Kaufmann notes that Nietzsche's various claims about woman des cend to a 'lower level — stylistically as well as in content'.33 These ironic nine aphorisms are no exception; there are moments within these aphorisms when Nietzsche's grand rhetoric and profound poetry seem to have been aban doned. Take for example Section 237: seven pithy, throwaway epigrams that clearly fail to live up to Nietzsche's literary talents. Yet Kaufmann fails to note that Nietzsche draws attention to this distinct change in tone with a disclaimer about 'his truths'. With a technique very different from the dog matic philosopher's sincere will to unveil truths about woman, Nietzsche is keen to point out that if he unveils anything, it is merely what is 'settled in him' regarding woman. What ensues is a parody of the 'clumsy obtrusiveness' and 'gruesome seriousness' that the luckless dogmatic philosopher employed in his failed attempt to win over truth. Through punctuating his truths about 'woman-in-itself, Nietzsche mocks that incompetent and impotent figure who insisted on disclosing the 'thing-in-itself. Far from the sincere will to truth displayed by the philosophical and feminist traditions, Nietzsche's truths are self-aware, perspectival and ironic. The irony of Nietzsche's elucidation of the truth of woman echoes his broader position of truth itself. If truth were a woman, then this woman derives her value from her modesty, her mystery and her distance from the</page><page sequence="10">322 NIETZSCHE AND A WOMAN NAMED TRUTH intrusive gaze of the philosophical tradition. The will to truth displayed by the dogmatic philosopher is criticised by Nietzsche for its naïve attempts to unveil this woman and destroy her value. Nietzsche's elucidations on woman reflect this attitude to truth; his texts mock the very notions of a truth about woman and 'woman-in-itself. Nietzsche's variegated truths about woman, as well as our struggle to find a consistent female theme in his work, demonstrate the futility of the philosophical endeavour to disclose such truths. The lack of a simple and straight forward truth about woman (in all her forms) in Nietzsche's work evidences his critique of the proud over-enthusiasm of the philosophical will to truth.
