<plain_text><page sequence="1">20 THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL ONE VIEW OF THE POETRY OF VERGIL By P. M. Cheek University of North Carolina POETRY of Vergil is that of a shy and lonely spirit, de- tached from the commoner walks of humanity and brooding long and deeply on the causes of things, the seemingly infinite strug- gle of man in the coils of circumstance toward the accomplishment of some ideal goal, and the ruthless might of divinity who should thus have involved him in the blind labyrinth of existence and have left him to journey a world- wide and weary pilgrim under the hands of inevitable fate. It is the utterance of a soul proud in its own grandeur and lofty ability, and yet bowed in lowly humility before some mighty power of spirit, which it is able to glean through the darkness and tears of things, like the image of a star in a lake, but which it can no more comprehend than it could the majesty of that star if set before the eyes in all its resplendent glow. The glory of the star would be beyond mortal vision or endurance and would con- sume rather than illuminate; so would the working of divinity over- power mortality and the minds of men with its magnificence. The revelation of the creation, as it falls from the lips of Anchises, is the answer of such a soul to the causes of things and to the primal order and purpose of life. In the beginning spirit fed the universe of heaven with its constellations and numberless stars and of earth with its broad lands and level sea, until mind infused into the mass and evolved life therefrom, so that there came into being races of men, flocks of birds, herds of beasts, and whatsoever of living and ani- mate creatures roam the joyful fields, the shining sea, or the vast expanses of air. This primal spirit was of celestial origin, but in order to enter the world it must take on the burden of flesh and thus leave its fiery and heavenly essence, until it should be again dis- solved from physical being by the coming of death and granted to float once more into infinite bliss and solitary joy amid the Elysian plains. Life thus becomes a darksome pilgrimage between two vast eternities of time, begotten of spiritual essence and returning to spiritual essence, anima breathed into the body at birth and dissolved. from it at death. Moreover, during its mortal habitation the soul is greatly retarded in its movements and sorely oppressed with the pains of flesh, so that it is with much rejoicing that it again takes flight into the primal essence from whence it came. And again, when after having reposed for many ages in the happy plains, it</page><page sequence="2">THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL 21 prepares for a second sojourn on the earth, it is carefully laved in the waters of oblivion, lest having remembrance of the far off spiritual haunts, it should grow too sad for mortal life. Our little life is not thus rounded with a sleep, but rather with an ethereal after and before, both of which are more joyful than the period of human existence, and the stage of life itself becomes the time of a half sleep for the soul. Such is Anchises' revelation of the origin and essence of ex- istence, almost the same that Socrates revealed to his friends during their last meeting in the prison, yet tinged with a sadness for mor- tality and a joy for immortality of the spirit that touches nearer per- haps the prayer of Little Brother Francis made to Sister Death. It seems to be the view of things most in accord with Vergil's own in- terpretation, and it is pleasant to think that through the mouth of the long dead seer he has perhaps recorded his own inner belief. This note of the shadowy sadness of the soul imprisoned is an ever recur- ring strain throughout his poetry, which bursts forth again and again in impassioned lines generally interpreted by lovers of poetry as his most excellent and personal expressions to the world. "Quae lucis miseris tarn dirae cupido?" "Dabit deus his quoque finem." "Sunt lacrimae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt." "O terque quaterque beati, Quis ante ora patrum Trojae sub moenibus altis Contigit oppetere \" These are the words of a saddened and long brooding spirit that has reflected much on the tears of things and pondered deeply in its quest to unravel the meaning thereof, and it is in such an asmosphere and in the appreciation of such feeling that the deepest charm of Vergil may be found. How could a soul once having experienced life and once having made an end of it in death desire a renewal of such ? Happiest and most blessed may be counted the ancient dead, those who have fallen in heroic struggle in behalf of some cause which they at least deemed great, and who have not lived to see the frustration of their hopes or to grow indolent and un-heroic on the fruits of noble toil : Thrice and four times blessed are these who have fallen before the walls of Troy and have been released from further toils. For the life of man, having been created from spirit and having been imbued with the ever-battling elements of heavenly matter and of fleshly form, is torn not only by this internal strife of opposite substances, but moreover, it is more or less blindly impelled and</page><page sequence="3">22 THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL driven on, often against its own will, by some mighty and inevitable power. This power is a kind of vague, impersonal force which di- rects not only the individual life but also the concerted efforts of humankind. Thus the vast and terrible wars which arouse nation against nation and involve the peoples of earth in untold slaughter and misery are not due so much to the pre-conceived schemes of men for such destruction, nor again to the transgression of some nation nor the sin of some individual, as to the inevitable decree of this force of divinity or fate. On account of the cherished wrath of implacable Juno, Aeneas endured so many wars and suffered endless misfor- tunes. On account of angered and hate-nourishing divinity long and miserable siege and ultimate destruction was brought on the city of Troy ; not to the beauty of Helen nor to the guilt of Paris, her lover, was due the city's anguish, but to the gods, to the inclementia divum. Helen is innocent and served merely as an instrument for the imme- diate accomplishment of long decreed and inevitable doom; she of- fered an easy medium for the beginning of open hostility, a1 beautiful tool which fate employed to set in motion the dread decree, this and nothing more. She was as powerless to have shuffled off her role in the catastrophe as the Trojan army was to have emerged victorious from it, for in either case the scales hung in the hands of the gods far beyond the comprehension or the understanding, much less the interference of mortal kind. Thus Helen plays her part and is hated by the Trojans who believe her responsible for all their city's grief, until divinity appears to the mind of Aeneas and reveals to him the true cause. Vergil invariably draws clearly the distinction between the all powerful and ultimate-deciding fate and the anthropomorphic divini- ties who appear before and hold commune with human creatures. These gods are invested with vast powers, which are often directed toward conflicting ends with the result of dissension and division of the divine desires and actions, but in the end their will and strength, even as those of men, although of course in a lesser degree, are subjected to the fates. There is a fierce struggle between two of these divinities over the right to supremacy of Carthage or of the new city which Aeneas shall found - that is, over which of these two cities shall finally be supreme mistress of the earth ; but the struggle is an utterly hopeless one in as much as the fates have already decided in favour of Rome, and there is really nothing that Juno can do to prevent the final consummation of their decision. Her sole strength and sole consolation lie in the ability to delay for a time the founding of the city and its consequent rise to supremacy, and meanwhile to</page><page sequence="4">THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL 23 wreak her unabating wrath on the unhappy mortal whom fate has chosen as an instrument for the establishment of the hated city. "There would come a far-ruling people and a king proud in war for the overthrow of Lybia :" Sic volvere Parcae. This Juno had heard and knew full well to be true ; this truth she also hated most bitterly, but there was nothing that she could do to prevent its final fulfill- ment ; she is as helpless against the will of fate as is Aeneas tossed about on the wide seas and yearning often to rest from his toil, even though it be in the rest of death. Even Jupiter, the father of gods and king of men, although he is often referred to as "onmipotens," in finality is also subject to the fates, whose decisions he can foresee and interpret but not undo. Thus when Venus, disturbed by the endless misfortunes and seeming ruin of Aeneas at sea, comes to inquire concerning his fortune, and the welfare of the city which he is to found, the answer of the high god is not a decree of his own, but rather a reiteration and interpre- tation of the old decree of fate with an assurance to her that it will be fulfilled: "Fear not Cytherea: the fates of your cherished peoples remain unchanged. Yet, since anxiety for them disturbs you, I will further reveal fatorum arcana." One of the divinities then reveals to another the plan of some older and higher power to which they are both subjected. Venus, like her rival, the queenly June, has no influence over nor strength against the plan ; it only happens that on this particular occasion the decision is in accord with the wishes of the love-goddess, and she therefore departs well pleased and very confident of her majesty and power; but if the scales had hung in the other direction, she would have been as angry and as helpless against her defeat as the brooding June was. Indeed the divinities, with the possible exception of Jupiter, seem more like the Christian conception of patron saints than that of supreme gods and goddesses. June is the patroness of Carthage, and accordingly does all within her ability for her city, appealing to the supreme power for their welfare and preservation; and baffled in her undertaking she succumbs to necessity. Venus on the other hand is the patron goddess of Aeneas in his struggle to found a kingdom, and the prospective patron of this kingdom to be. Thus along the journey of existence man wanders guided or driven by a two-fold power, by the capricious, avenging, and yet often kindly deities, whom he worships and appeases in appropriate form, and to whom he may appeal in time of misfortune for comfort and consolation, and secondly by fate, the implacable, the incompre-</page><page sequence="5">24 THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL hensible and unrelenting director of both gods and men, the power from which there is no escape and to which there is no appeal. The conception is that of a soul innately tragic in its view of things, and the picture of man as he wanders along this pilgrimage to such a soul will naturally be melancholy and colored in deeper tints than appear to the eyes of most of his fellow pilgrims. The shadows are deeper and the vistas of light more rare than most men would be willing to admit, and indeed, it almost seems that to this poet the shadows are the dearer and more kindly, for more often than otherwise his pic- tures are those of man lost in the glooms or battling in the weariest struggles of existence. His greatest heights are reached in the de- scription of a fleet lost at sea amid the wild commotions of a terrible storm, portraying the vain wrestling of mortality with the mighty and unyielding forces of nature; the anguished strife of dying and wounded soldiers fighting amid the conflagration of a ruined city under the light of the pitying moon, portraying the deadly division and contention of men among themselves in contrast with the quiet serenity of nature ; or again the agony of a mortal body in the coils of death, the dread picture of a Laocoon circled with the coils and bitten with the fangs of serpents ; and greatest of all the pangs and intolerable torture of a heart yielded utterly to the sweet delight of love only to find this love turn to anguish and consume the heart that had nourished it. If one were to choose from the poet's works the half dozen scenes of supreme excellence, these would in all prob- ability include some such list as the following: the storm at sea in the first book, the fight on the last night of Troy in the second book, the destruction of Laocoon and his sons in the same, the yearning of Dido in her lonely moonlit chamber after the banquet and the suicide of Dido, both in the fourth book, and the meeting of Aeneas with Dido and Anchises in the lower world. None of these are scenes of rejoicing or festivity, but rather of deep gloom and shadowy melan- choly, analyzing the human soul in some supreme moment of strug- gle of defeat. Moreover, even a casual glance will show that not only is the subject one of sadness in each case, but also that the method of treatment and the poetic atmosphere enveloping each event is one of shadowy and mysterious melancholy. Many poets have felt and portrayed in their lines the mystic loneliness and sadness of the moon as it shines calmly on some scene of deserted nature, on some picture of human struggle, or on some forsaken individual in the depths of grief, but few have caught this feeling and painted it more poetically than Vergil has in several of the above mentioned passages. The city of Troy in its last moments of agony, crowded with angry,</page><page sequence="6">THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL 25 despairing and exultant soldiers, resounding with moans of desperate women and children and oaths of dying men, is suddenly flooded under calm and peaceful light as the moon, the gentlest and most placid of heavenly bodies, rises from the clouded sky. The friendly light of the friendly moon has fallen on the stretches of human slaughter, and there is utter serenity through all heaven and earth save in this little den of bloody mortals. Even finer than this, how- ever, is the meeting scene of Aeneas and Dido on the "campi Lugen- tes" of the Elysian plains ; as Aeneas advances through the fields of shadowy spirits amid the whispering myrtle groves where souls of unhappy lovers crowd upon him from every side, suddenly there emerges from the deepest gloom the spirit of Dido shining in the pure and chaste resplendence of the moon at the first of the month. And almost equal to either of these is the midnight chamber of Dido where the love-stricken queen anguishes through the night on her royal couch until the kindly moon comes to give her sisterly com- panionship, and glow around her that she may vision her beloved though she be absent from him and he from her. These are the sadly beautiful and strange pictures that appealed to Vergil's imagi- nation and the ones which he painted with the most consummate skill. There are scenes of joy in the poet's work, to be sure, but it will often be found that even these have a delicate touch of this same brooding melancholy, some very gentle stroke to show that in the halls of rejoicing there may lurk the ghost of wistful repining. In the feast hall of Dido the guests have banqueted to their hearts' de- sire and now recline on massive jewelled couches amid robes of royal purple and crimson; everywhere there is joy and contentment and apparent repose even from serious or unhappy thoughts. Suddenly the long-haired minstrel takes up his lyre to sing and entertain the company of revellers, and what is the burden of his song? The wandering of the moon and the eclipses of the sun, the causes of the seasons and the courses of the stars, - in other words the attempt of man to fathom the mysteries of nature and explain the universe. Thus amid a scene of happiest merry-making, the thought is suddenly turned to questions of deep seriousness and half sadness. It is almost always so with Vergil: he was not of a nature to be ever jubilantly joyful or even quietly happy for long at a time. To appreciate a poet one must surrender one's self, temporarily at least to the poet's point of view. To understand the deepest ap- peal and most wistful charm, of Vergil, therefore, one must for the time being sympathize with his outlook on life and with his inter- pretation of the causes and meaning thereof. These have seemed to</page><page sequence="7">26 THE HIGH SCHOOL JOURNAL be in accordance with those of many other poets and thinkers who have an element of the true vates in their being. Human life con- sists of the imprisonment of spiritual essence in physical form with the resultant creation of living creatures, who are thenceforth guided by a twofold conception of heavenly and religious power, one the kindly presences and aid of anthropomorphic divinities, the other blind and uncompromising force with final and omnipotent decision over all things, both human and divine. As a result all serious and true life is tragic moving through struggles of despair and often ending in uncompromising defeat, with the human creature de- stroyed after he has served the caprice of fate. And yet the com- plaint of VergiPs characters against such an order of things is rare, and even when it does come it is usually imbued with a sense of the necessity for endurance and with a calm and willing acceptance of the necessity, with the hope that all may be directed for the best by the divinity which understands more of primal causes and ultimate outcomes than man can ever hope to know. Perhaps it was this gentle humility before divinity and this essentially spiritual inter- pretation of the origin, pilgrimage, and final solution of life that almost made Vergil a; saint in the eyes of the mediaeval Catholic and that caused him to seem the purest of pagan souls to Dante.
