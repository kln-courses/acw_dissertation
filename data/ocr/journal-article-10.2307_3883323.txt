<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amer. Zool., 27:1099-1101 (1987) BOOK REVIEWS Darwin's Metaphor. Robert M. Young. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1985, xvii + 341 pp., $44.50. This book is a collection of six interrelated essays that were published in their original versions between 1969 and 1980, and updated for inclusion in this vol? ume. Their titles are: (1) The impact of Darwin on conventional thought; (2) Malthus and the evolution- ists: the common context of biological and social the- ory; (3) The role of psychology in the nineteenth- century evolutionary debate; (4) Darwin's metaphor: does nature select?; (5) Natural theology, Victorian periodicals, and the fragmentation of a common con? text; and (6) The historiographic and ideological con- texts ofthe nineteenth-century debate on man's place in nature. The title of the book, Darwin's Metaphor, refers to Darwin's use ofthe term "natural selection" and the anthropomorphic implications of the term, as when in "On the Origin of Species" he wrote, "It must be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, pre- serving and adding up all that is good." The book has a subtitle also, "Nature's Place in Victorian Cul? ture" which refers to the Victorian era with its ortho- doxy in which Darwin presented his theory of natural selection. Darwin had returned from his voyage on the Beagle in 1836 and Victoria became queen in 1837. This volume has 84 pages of extensive notes and bibliography. Historians of science will find these par? ticularly useful. The book deals largely with the nineteenth-century debate over the place of humans in nature, i.e., whether natural laws apply to humans as well as to the rest of the living species. The concept that natural laws do indeed apply to all living organisms engendered con- siderable controversy, particularly because ofthe the- ological implications. Although this debate had been going on since as early as 1790, it became more acute after the publication of Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" in 1859. The excellent discussion of this con? troversy, particularly in the first essay which deals specifically with theology and Darwinism, would enlighten many Creation Scientists. The author makes the interesting points that in spite of the controversy between the evolutionists and fundamental theolo- gists that Darwin's theory immediately engendered, he is buried in Westminster Abbey and also that Fred- erick Temple having written in 1884, "We cannot find that Science, in teaching Evolution, has yet asserted anything that is inconsistent with Revela- tion," went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury. The author, Young, contends in a postscript that this book should be of value not only to historians of science concerned with the nineteenth century, but that it is even timely for the 1980s, in how we perceive the place of science in our culture. He points out on page 247 that natural selection continues to scrutinize (as Darwin put it), but often a scientist, such as a genetic engineer, is now doing the selecting. Young</page></plain_text>
