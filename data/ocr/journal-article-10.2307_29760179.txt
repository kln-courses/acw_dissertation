<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judicial Notice: The Dem Ex Maehtna of Evidence by Leonard M. Niehoff One of my favorite New Yorker cartoons depicts an actor play? ing Hamlet. The actor has a petrified look on his face that can mean only one thing: He has forgotten his next line. Offstage in the wings, a script assistant stands with his hands cupped around his mouth, desperately trying to prompt the Prince with the missing dialogue: "Or not to be." So it is at trial. We attend diligently to the major aspects of the production. We meticulously choreograph the leading lines, the star witnesses, the flashy props, and the calculated moments of high drama and comic relief. In carefully crafting our performance, however, we may neglect some less con? spicuous elements: the follow-up lines, the dull-but-indis? pensable documents, and the tedious intervals that make the more exciting moments possible. Yet, after the curtain rises on the trial, once we come to the horrifying realization that we have overlooked something, that forgotten item magnifies to fill the stage. The small, boring, or insignificant detail seems to take center stage. In some ancient Greek and Roman plays, at moments like that when circumstances became critical and apparently beyond saving, a friendly deity would roll in on a piece of stage machinery to help. This deus ex machina was not a pretty way to solve a problem. Indeed, it was clumsy, inele? gant, unsophisticated, a little desperate, and not wholly reli? able. Nevertheless, it put an end to the tragedy?for the audi? ence and the actors. Litigators have at their disposal the functional equivalent of this classical theatre device: the deus ex machina of the rules of evidence?judicial notice. Most of us do not have occasion to think at all about this oft-overlooked procedural mechanism. In fact, if we think about the doctrine at all, we tend to view it as having very lim? ited utility, if any. After all, the stars of our production are the witnesses through whom we put on our evidence, not the excruciatingly obvious types of facts (the bit players) that come to mind whenever anyone invokes judicial notice. We Leonard M. Niehoff is with Butzel Long in Ann Arbor, Michigan. may resort to it if we do not want to bother offering evidence of facts everyone already knows. Alternatively, we may roll judicial notice in (like the deity of ancient theatre) to fill a minor gap in proofs. Otherwise, judicial notice tends to wait in the wings forever. Yet, judicial notice is an aspiring star of unfulfilled poten? tial. Its stage presence is extremely powerful because a noticed fact is a conclusively established fact. Successfully invoke judicial notice and Voilal The fact in question is not merely supported, it is settled. A couple of examples demonstrate the strategic advantages this offers. Consider the copyright infringement case Walker v. Time Life Films, 615 F. Supp. 430 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). In this case, the plaintiff, a former police officer who wrote an auto? biography about his experiences, claimed that the defendants misappropriated his characters and ideas in their film. Plain? tiff's expert submitted an affidavit claiming that the film's leading characters were substantially similar to characters in the book. The court rejected this and took judicial notice of the fact that "members of the New York Police Department are often portrayed as Irish, smokers, drinkers, and third or fourth generation police officers," which the court noted were "the only identifiable similarities]" between the police officers in the book and in the film. Id. at 438. The conclusive establishment of that fact was powerful because it then permitted the court to hold, as a matter of law, that the divergences in the two sets of characters outweighed "any abstract similarities that may inevitably be found in works centered on New York City policemen patrolling a crime-ridden area" (so much for the typical "battle of the experts"). Id. at 439. The battle was won quickly and deci? sively by the court itself. Consider another example: an injunction lawsuit involving whether an airport can ban newspaper vending machines. At trial, the airport argued that it furnished an adequate alterna? tive means of distribution (part of the First Amendment issue) because witnesses testified that the gift shop stayed open from Litigation Fall 2000 Volume 27 Number 1</page><page sequence="2">6:30 am until 9 pm. According to defense counsel's argument, this permitted all but a fraction of air travelers?those few bleary-eyed stragglers arriving after hours when the gift shop is closed?to buy newspapers. How might the plaintiff have proven to the judge that the potential harm was greater than the defendant contends (i.e., more than a handful of deprived people)? Not to worry: "The Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that flights often arrive after the scheduled arrival time." Multimedia Pub. Co. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Greenville Spartanburg Airport Dist., 714 F.Supp. 977, 979 (D.S.C. 1991), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 991 F.2d 154 (4th Cir. 1993). Your case may involve a fact that is not controversial but is still important to your proofs?perhaps in a way your oppo? nent does not appear to grasp. You could offer testimonial or documentary evidence to substantiate it, but why not try judi? cial notice first? If the court declines to take notice, you can still offer your evidence. If the court agrees to take notice, you are in even better shape because you have proven your fact quickly, inexpensively, and indisputably. Here, judicial notice may play a part that goes beyond the role of deus ex machina to save a faltering performance. Under this scenario, judicial notice acts as a cleverly devised twist in the plot line. The script for introducing judicial notice is pretty dry. Under most renditions, a fact may be judicially noticed if it is "not subject to reasonable dispute" because either it is "gen _iL_?fagro erally known in the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court" or is "capable of accurate and ready determination by sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Rule 201, Fed. R. Evid. (There are no other rules in the 200 sequence. Judicial notice stands alone like a performer who defies type? casting, a veritable Zelig of evidence.) Generally, a party may ask a court to take judicial notice of a fact, or the court may do so on its own motion after hearing any opposition. Rule 201(c)-(e), Fed. R. Evid. In addition, like a good character actor, judicial notice can perform effectively against a variety of judicial backdrops because it may be brought out "at any stage of the proceeding." Rule 201(f), Fed. R. Evid. This includes motions for summary judgment, trial, and appeal; any stage is appropriate for this performer. At first blush, Rule 201 appears to set a very demanding standard. Nevertheless, because the judge is the one who determines what is (and what is not) subject to reasonable dis? pute and which sources can (and cannot) reasonably be ques? tioned, these constraints are not necessarily restrictive. Judicial notice, of course, is used more commonly with respect to facts that everyone accepts or, as Rule 201 suggests, can confirm by reference to authoritative sources. Thus, courts typically take judicial notice of various official pro? ceedings and documents, such as elections, proclamations, orders, pleadings, and so on. Judges also tend to take notice of well settied scientific facts, such as the rising and setting of the sun, the law of gravity, and the temperature at which water freezes. They take notice of well known geographic facts, such as the location of streets, the layout of a subway system, and the territory encompassed by a city or county. They also take notice of historical events, such as a presidential admin? istration, the Great Depression, changes in political circum? stances, and military conflicts. Courts have taken judicial notice of many obvious facts, such as life's inevitable finality: the fact that, sooner or later, everyone dies. Devlin v. Transportation Communications Intern. Union, 175 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 1991). Courts also have taken notice of the self-evident facts that it is not prudent to try to get off a moving train and that a loaded revolver in the hands of two men locked in a struggle is a "dangerous instru? mentality." See Jacob v. Flint &amp; PMR Co., 105 Mich. 450, 63 N.W. 502 (1895) and People v. Brown, 37 Mich. App. 565, 195 N.W.2d60(1972). Disputes over the location of a particular place is another arena in which judicial notice frequendy appears, " 'for the obvious reason that geographic locations are facts which are not generally controversial.'" United States v. Bello, 194 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting U.S. v. Piggie, 622 F.2d 486, 488 (10th Cir. 1980)). Thus, the court in Bello turned aside the arguments of a prisoner?convicted of bashing in the head of a fellow inmate by using a broom handle?that the trial judge erred in taking judicial notice that the Puerto Rican prison in which he was incarcerated was within the territorial jurisdic? tion of the United States. Notwithstanding a prison official's testimony on cross?in which she admitted that she never conducted a tide search to determine who owned the land on which the prison sat?the court of appeals held the trial judge's examination of government maps, official letters, and public laws "provided a sufficient basis for judicial notice" that the Government of Puerto Rico had transferred owner? ship of the property to the United States. Id. at 24. In fact, surveying the judicial notice cases can have a sort Litigation Fall 2000 Volume 27 Number 1</page><page sequence="3">of reassuring, restful effect. Litigation sometimes can lead to absurd results. How nice to know that, on occasion, reality and common sense can intervene. John Mortimer wrote, "No brilliance is needed in the law. Nothing but common sense, and relatively clean fingernails." The doctrine of judicial notice is indeed one of common sense. "The theory is that, where a fact is well known by all reasonably intelligent peo? ple in the community, or its existence is so easily deter minable with certainty from unimpeachable sources, it would not be good sense to require formal proof." Harper v. Killion, 345 S.W.2d 309, 311 (Tex. Civ. App. 1961). How reassuring to know, too, that judges believe even what lawyers tell them?at least when lawyers say something beyond all rea? sonable dispute. Judicial notice is not, however, limited to matters of com? mon sense. It extends to facts that reliable resources confirm. Thus, when a judge takes notice of the fact that Xanax is an anti-anxiety medication, that Sorna? is a trademark for preparations of carisoprodol, and that TRANS is shorthand for a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, the judge does not do so based on memory or by taking inventory of the contents of the average medicine cabinet. Adams v. United States, 964 F. Supp. 511 (D. Mass 1996). He consults some standard reference works. Similarly, when a judge takes notice of the fact that the normal rate of speed for a walking adult male is 2.9 to 4.4 feet per second, the judge does not base his decision on observations he made while staring dis? tractedly out the courtroom window. He looks it up. Hoist v. United States, 755 F. Supp. 260 (E.D. Mo. 1991). Courts do not just take notice of the existence of facts so patently obvious that efforts to dispute them would be absurd. Judicial notice also has proven to be wonderfully helpful in cutting short that strangest of one-act surrealist plays: the pris? oner in pro per case. All lawyers have seen these cases where a plaintiff claims something that technically cannot be proved or disproved yet is clearly impossible. Thus, a court took notice of the fact that a prisoner's accusations against various correctional personnel simply could not be true although, in this case, the ruling was not exactly a bold stroke of judicial activism. The prisoner claimed correctional personnel put voices in his head to emit noises and interrogate him about his case. Morrison v. Martin, 755 F. Supp. 683 (E.D.N.C.), aff'd, 917 F.2d 1302 (4th Cir. 1990). The larger point is this: Judicial notice does not merely allow a court to accept what everyone knows; it also allows a court to reject what everyone disbelieves. As one court put it, "[W]here the facts testified to are opposed to all natural laws and common experience, that it is inconceivable that any such thing could have occurred, courts will refuse to believe it, on the ground that they will take judicial notice of its incredibil? ity." Cohen v. United States, 129 F.2d 733,736 (8th Cir. 1942). Of course, incredible things sometimes turn out to be true, but judicial notice follows common sense. Common sense invari? ably plays the odds. Thoughts of incredible things lead us, of course, to thoughts about human behavior. Lawyers fancy themselves psychologists, and judges are lawyers, so some generalizing about what people normally do (and do not) is to be expected. Such generalizing rests on experience and does not require the close analysis of scientific resources. For example: ? We know what too much drinking does to a person, so a court can take judicial notice of the fact that the unre? strained use of liquor leads to drunkenness. Gaines v. Sun LifeAssur. Co. of Canada, 306 Mich. 192 (1943). ? We know that people can be slobs who make no effort to preserve the environment; a court can therefore take judicial notice that a government decision finding a river to be navigable would "doubtiess" have adverse effects on riparian landowners, including open gates, broken fences, beer cans, trash, garbage, and forest fires. Loving v. Alexander, 745 F.2d 861 (4th Cir. 1984). (The court also lists "stray bullets" among these adverse effects. This seems somewhat less certain than the other items, but then perhaps we know that some people are not just slobs, but violent slobs.) ? We know that some people are mentally ill; thus, a court can take judicial notice of the fact that there are psychi? atric conditions that cause individuals to exaggerate life situations. O'Connorv. United States, 159 F.R.D. 22 (D. Md. 1994), aff'd, 54 F.3d 773 (4th Cir. 1995). ? We know that prehistoric thinking did not perish with the glaciers or with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; therefore, a court can take judicial notice of the fact that, in the last 30 years, there has been no significant decline in discrimination, although it may now manifest itself in more subtle forms. Jendusa v. Cancer Treatment Centers of America, 868 F. Supp. 1006 (N.D. 111. 1994). ? We know that not everyone enjoys the glamorous, stress-free, and morally pure existence of the litigator; a court can therefore take judicial notice of the fact that nurses spend at least some of their time performing Litigation Fall 2000 Volume 27 Number 1</page><page sequence="4">unskilled tasks (Watts v. Organogenesis, 30 F. Supp.2d 101,110 (D. Mass. 1998)), that workers who assemble overhead steel beams have an extraordinarily danger? ous occupation (McDonough v. General Motors Corp., 388 Mich. 430, 201 N.W.2d 609 (1970)), and that air traffic controllers are not immune from the scourge of drugs (National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. v. Burnley, 700 F. Supp. 1043 (N.D. Cal. 1988)). The courts have not limited their analyses of judicial notice to facts about the human species. In Rivers v. The New York City Housing Authority, 264 A.D.2d 342, 694 N.Y.S.2d 57 (1st Department 1999), the trial judge had taken judicial notice "that pit bulls by nature are inherently dangerous," rul? ing that a landlord could be held strictly liable for injuries to an infant tenant. The appellate court reversed, holding that plaintiff failed to show the particular dog in question had pre? viously displayed any vicious or violent behavior. In one of the more creative uses of judicial notice, Judge Kimba M. Wood rejected the reasoning of the maker of Spam? luncheon meat in its trademark-infringement action seeking to enjoin introduction of a new Muppet character: a wild boar named Spa'am. Hormel Food Corp. v. Jim Henson Productions, Inc., 1995 WL 567369 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 1995). Hormel, among other things, objected to a proposed scene in the movie "Muppet Treasure,Island" where Spa'am and his tribe of boars "capture Kermit the Frog and Rizzo Rat and tie them to stakes," presumably to prepare the evening meal. Clearly enjoying the case, Judge Wood wrote, The court notes that the morality of a boar tying a frog and a rat to stakes and eating them is very much an open question. The court takes judicial notice of the fact that "catch-as-catch can" is the generally accepted rule of behavior in the animal kingdom. If, on the other hand, we accept the anthropomorphic nature of these charac? ters, then to the extent that Spa'am is the leader of a tribe on Treasure Island, and is dealing with what he perceives to be unlawful invaders, his conduct would not necessar? ily be viewed as illegal or immoral in historical context. Id. Horses also appear to be a favorite judicial notice player in the animal kingdom context. One court recognized that a box freight car standing still is not a frightening object to a horse of "ordinary gentleness." Gilbert v. Flint &amp; PM Ry. Co., 51 Mich. 488,16 N.W. 868 (1883). (Presumably, the same is true of horses of extraordinary gentleness. Ungentle horses are, naturally, of a different breed altogether.) The cases that notice facts about horse behavior (there are more than you think) underscore an important point about judicial notice. As time passes and our shared understanding of the world changes, some settled facts will lose their famil? iarity. There was a time when a court could take judicial notice of the fact that it is impossible to make an accurate inventory of saw logs afloat in a stream (McGuire v. Saginaw Circuit Judge, 101 Mich. 275,59 N.W. 610 (1894)), and of the fact that everyone understands the phrase Beecher business to mean adultery (Bailey v. Kalamazoo Pub. Co., 40 Mich 251 (1879)), and of the fact that secret societies need to have the floors of their lodge halls deadened so sound does not travel (Young v. Collett, 63 Mich. 331, 29 N.W. 850 (1886)). Those times may have passed, but just as shared understanding can change, so can other social circumstances. While in 1990, a court could take judicial notice of the fact that life in the United States generally offers greater opportunities than life in Mexico, that truth may not be as indisputable in the future. Sony a C. By and Through Olivas v. Arizona School for the Deaf and Blind, 743 F. Supp. 700 (D. Ariz. 1990). This leads to the next point: Many facts are subject to judicial notice today that would not have been subject to judicial notice 10 years ago?or, at the current rate of change, 10 minutes ago?because of the rich array of authoritative sources available. The truly remark? able development is not, however, that there are better resources than ever. It is that there is ready access to those resources. Fifteen years ago, a well stocked reference shelf in a litigator's library was a point of pride. Today it is a quaint embarrassment. Indeed, the advent of the information age has rendered judi? cial notice more useful and relevant than ever. Twenty years ago, an attorney had access to a few reference books, some government reports, maps, and almanacs. Now, that attorney can plumb a seemingly endless supply of resources available through the Internet. These resources are chock full of facts waiting in the wings, eager for a chance to perform. Will we ever reach the point where real lawyers do not need evidence? Of course not. Most facts material to litiga? tion will not lend themselves to judicial notice. Recently, for example, the Second Circuit held that a district judge had improperly invoked judicial notice to admit actuarial tables Many facts are subject to jud? icial notice today that would not have been subject to jud? icial notice 10 years ago. into evidence in a personal injury claim. Hough-Scoma v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2000 WL 19104 (2d Cir. Jan. 7, 2000). The judge at trial judicially noticed, over defendant's objection, tables that were discussed in testimony by plain? tiff's expert apparently formed the basis for the expert's con? clusions as to future lost wages. The Second Circuit held that plaintiff should not have been permitted to use judicial notice as a substitute for an insufficient foundation for the documents' admission into evidence. Id. Even when the judicial notice doctrine does seem to apply, some judges may feel reluctant to tell a jury that it must take any fact as conclusively established. Perhaps that is why, in this day and age, some courts are reluctant in tobacco litiga? tion to take judicial notice of the fact that the health risks of smoking have been common knowledge for decades. Hill v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 44 F.Supp. 2d 837 (W.D. Ky. 1999); Thomas v. R.J. Reynolds Co., 11 F. Supp.2d 850 (S.D. Miss. 1998). See Roysdon v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 849 F.2d 230, 236 (6th Cir. 1988) (the court treats as established fact that "[t]he normal use of cigarettes is know by ordinary customers to present grave health risks"); Guilbeault v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 2000 WL 124374 (D.R.I. Jan. 12, (Please turn to page 63) Litigation Fall 2000 Volume 27 Number 1</page><page sequence="5">Judicial Notice (Continued from page 34) 2000) (the court takes judicial notice that, as of 1964, general disease-related health risks of smoking were "common knowledge" in the community). For better or worse, judicial notice may move up from a bit player, but it will never take center stage. Neverthe? less, every good litigator should remem? ber this deus ex machina, think about its strategic use, and watch for opportuni? ties to roll it out. Judicial notice can help establish significant facts beyond dis? pute. It can fill minor, but annoying, gaps in our proofs. It can assist us in becoming the type of 20th century, fact driven, detail-oriented, no-loose-ends type of trial lawyer that we want to be? or not to be. 10 Litigation Fall 2000 Volume 27 Number 1</page></plain_text>
