Ferguson, and Chip Colwell InTroduCTIon The Hopi people have strong and abiding cultural ties to the lands where their  ancestors lived in ancient times. They recognize these lands as Hopitutskwa  (Hopi land), a cultural landscape marked by the numerous archaeological sites  and named places that figure into Hopi oral traditions as their metaphorical  “footprints.” today much of Hopitutskwa has passed from Hopi ownership into  private property and public lands managed by multiple federal agencies. access  to ancestral sites has thus become increasingly restricted, making it difficult for  the Hopi people to maintain their historical traditions based on cultural prac- tices embedded in the land. to address this situation, the Hopi cultural preservation office—the Hopi  tribal government’s official department that helps manage, preserve, and protect  traditional culture—uses the political and regulatory processes provided by the  national Historic preservation act (as well as other federal and state laws). The  tribe draws on this national Historic preservation act in particular to identify tra- ditional cultural properties, evaluate their eligibility for the national register of  Historic places, and document the Hopi history and cultural practices associated  with them. Using the research opportunities created by a series of relatively small  projects, the Hopi tribe is building a regional perspective on the tangible sites of  its heritage that are associated with the retention and transmission of the tribe’s  cultural practices and intangible traditions. doi: 10.5876/9781607325727.c003 33 </page> <page sequence="2"> 34 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL in this chapter we describe how three separate historic preservation projects  enabled the Hopi tribe to trace a physical connection between the Hopi Mesas  in arizona and glen canyon in Utah. in collaborative research with archaeo- logical ethnographers, the Hopi cultural preservation office investigated Hopi  traditional cultural properties along a pipeline right-of-way, along a highway  improvement project, and in the glen canyon national recreation area. These  investigations relate specific historic properties to larger concepts of landscape and  cultural identity. The results of these projects serve to elucidate the connections  between individual sites in glen canyon and the regional context of Hopitutskwa,  including clan migrations and narratives of a legendary boy named tiyo that  encompass the gulf of california. The intangible heritage of the Hopi people—the traditional cultural beliefs and  practices that are important in maintaining their sense of identity and continu- ity—is intimately linked to historical events that are situated in different locations  across the Hopitutskwa landscape. contemporary Hopi customs, including cer- emonies, largely focus on commemorating the places that contributed to the devel- opment of Hopi society and religion. such places retain power that is activated  and enlivened through ongoing cultural traditions. in this way, the Hopitutskwa  landscape represents a collection of experiences that cohesively binds the Hopi  people to the land and to each other. in a managerial context, the articulation of  Hopi land and identity is accomplished by the tribe’s participation in the national  historic preservation program. The projects we discuss below were designed as collaborative, community-based  participatory research to advance Hopi scholarship. in each project, members of  the Hopi tribe and non-Hopi researchers worked jointly to identify ancestral  archaeological sites, springs, shrines, landforms, and other tangible places with  cultural importance to the Hopi people. documenting Hopi traditional places  has wide-ranging benefits, foremost of which is the preservation of historical and  place-related knowledge for use by future generations of Hopis. furthermore,  working within the framework of the national Historic preservation act provides  a means of communicating the importance of specific Hopi places to non-Hopi  audiences, thus facilitating the implementation of culturally sensitive land man- agement strategies. in this chapter, we reflect on the historical role and contemporary politics of  cultural memories of landscape, providing a cultural analysis of community engage- ment that combines archaeological analyses of space with ethnographic research.  These issues are particularly timely given the evolving relationship of americanist  archaeology to heritage policy and identity politics. </page> <page sequence="3"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 35 hoPI hIsTorY and hoPI land The land is really important to us because it’s our ancestral land. That’s where  we have been, and i think it’s good to make pilgrimage to various places and  leave your prayer feathers . . . That’s where the spirits live, and that’s how we  maintain peace. (alph secakuku 2011) Hopis’ connection with the southwestern United states extends back to the  Motisinom (“first people”), who are the earliest ancestors of the Hopi. according  to traditional accounts, other Hopi ancestors later emerged into the fourth World  (the present world) through the sipapuni, a travertine cone located in the Little  colorado river gorge near the grand canyon. Upon emergence, the people  encountered Màasaw, the guardian of the earth, who instructed them to go in search  of the tuuwanasavi, Hopis’ spiritual center of the universe. The people formed clans,  split apart, and began a long series of migrations toward their ultimate destination  at the Hopi Mesas (courlander 1971, 1982; crane 1925; curtis 1922:16–98; fewkes  1900; Mindeleff 1891:16–39; Voth 1905; Yava 1978:36–40). during their migrations, these clans came into contact with the Hoopoq’yaqam  (Those Who Went to the northeast), another group of Hopi ancestors who trace  their origins to Mesoamerica (ferguson and Lomaomvaya 1999; Washburn 1995).  Upon leaving Mesoamerica, the Hoopoq’yaqam traveled to palatkwapi (the red  Walled city), where they stayed until floods and social unrest prompted them to  continue their migrations northward. They eventually joined the other clans and  settled new villages as they journeyed to the Hopi Mesas (teague 1993). collectively,  these groups are considered to be Hisatsinom, Hopis’ ancient ancestors (ferguson  and colwell-chanthaphonh 2006:97; Kuwanwisiwma 2004). today, the Hopi people are organized as a federally recognized tribe with a reser- vation in northeastern arizona, within the core of Hopitutskwa (figure 3.1). Hopis  continue to orient themselves with their ancestral lands through oral traditions and  ceremonies. from certain religious perspectives, Hopitutskwa encompasses a com- plex geographical and temporal span that includes all places Hopi ancestors resided  in the past (balenquah 2008; bernardini 2005; ferguson et al. 2009; ferguson and  Lomaomvaya 2011:166; Jenkins et al. 1994; Kuwanwisiwma and ferguson 2009;  Lyons 2003). This landscape is dense with culturally important locations, includ- ing landforms associated with deities and historical events, sacred springs, rivers,  trails, and ancestral sites (Koyiyumptewa and colwell-chanthaphonh 2011). The  land is remembered through stories, ceremonial reenactments, and pilgrimages.  Hopitutskwa remains vital in the daily life of the Hopi people. as Hopitutskwa passed from Hopi ownership into private property and federally  managed land, varying historical representations of Hopitutskwa were developed  </page> <page sequence="4"> 36 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL Figure 3.1. Hopitutskwa envisioned as a homvìikya, or pilgrimage route, connecting a  series of important Hopi shrines surrounding the Hopi Reservation in northern Arizona.  to respond to political-geographical needs to assert and defend contemporary  political and cultural rights. in the early twentieth century, for example, the people  of second Mesa presented a letter to the commissioner of indian affairs petition- ing for access to traditional lands encompassed by a series of shrines that constitute  points along a homvìikya (pilgrimage route) that is used in ongoing Hopi traditions  (Whiteley 1989:7–39). tribal leaders explained that the land has “been a most vital  subject of our people or tribe at present and for generations past” and that they are  concerned because surrounding areas are no longer easily accessible because of the  encroachment of outsiders. “for centuries the Hopi shrines at the distance points,  which borders the Hopi people from every direction, marked and designated the  Hopis’ tribal land boundary lines. before the other peoples came the Hopis’ essen- tial needs at away places were all obtainable.” The Hopis conclude the letter with  an appeal for the return of “our land we love so well . . . for the benefit of our future  generations” (Hopi tribe 1930). Hopi aboriginal lands as determined by the indian claims commission (icc),  a judicial panel established in 1946 that addressed indian land losses, ultimately  did not encompass the entire area claimed by the leaders of second Mesa. The  </page> <page sequence="5"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 37 icc reduced the extent of the Hopi claim using a judicial standard of exclusive  use and occupancy for the period following the entry of the United states into  the southwest in 1848 (indian claims commission 1970). The area described by  second Mesa leaders, however, has come to be viewed as the extent of Hopitutskwa  by many non-Hopis. Meanwhile, Hopi traditionalists maintain that the homvìikya  encircles the contemporary core, or “plaza,” of the Hopi homeland, while the  greater domain of Hopi stewardship extends outward to encompass a much larger  area—one that includes all of Hopis’ ancestral lands (Hedquist et al. 2014; Jenkins  et al. 1994:8; Kuwanwisiwma and ferguson 2009:92). The area and associated pil- grimage are significant because they demonstrate the ongoing role of the land and  its features in contemporary Hopi life (eggan 1994:15). The preservation of Hopi  culture depends in part on continuing the traditional uses of Hopitutskwa, includ- ing respecting the ancestral sites it contains. The Hopi people continue to defend the traditional lands that lie outside their  reservation. in recent years, the Hopi cultural preservation office has become  increasingly involved in the research needed to implement the national Historic  preservation act to identify Hopi traditional cultural properties on federally  managed land. This approach enables members of the Hopi tribe to maintain  their historical traditions and cultural practices associated with the land and to  use scholarly standards in documenting Hopitutskwa at a regional level. Hopis  consider all of their ancestral places as integral in understanding the broader pic- ture of Hopi history and religion. The salient features of the Hopi cultural land- scape identified during these projects illustrate the depth and complexity of Hopi  culture and the role of individual elements in shaping notions of Hopi identity  and well-being. The naTIonal hIsTorIC PreservaTIon aCT and The  IdenTIFICaTIon oF hoPI TradITIonal CulTural ProPerTIes The Hopi tribe never accepted the monetary payment for its aboriginal lands  provided by the indian claims commission. Those funds remain in a trust  account accruing interest. Many Hopi people feel strongly that they have a moral  right to use their traditional lands, even if that right is not formally recognized  by the United states. in order to protect its cultural interests in Hopi aborigi- nal land, the Hopi tribe has turned to participation in the historic preservation  planning process to make sure Hopi cultural sites are considered during federal  undertakings. The national Historic preservation act (nHpa) of 1966, as amended, was passed  to preserve the historical and cultural foundations of the United states as a living  </page> <page sequence="6"> 38 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL part of community life and development in order to give a sense of orientation to  the american people. section 106 of this act requires federal agencies to make a rea- sonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties included on or eligible  for the national register of Historic places (nrHp) prior to any federal under- taking, to assess the potential adverse effects of the undertaking on those historic  properties, and to consider how adverse effects can be resolved. federal agencies  are required to consider such properties in planning actions and to consult indian  tribes, interested parties, and the state Historic preservation office. section 110 of  the nHpa makes agencies responsible for preserving historic properties owned or  controlled by the agency. Historic properties are eligible for inclusion in the nrHp when they meet one  or more of the following criteria set forth in nrHp regulations: (a) association  with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our  history, (b) association with the lives of persons significant in our past, (c) embodi- ment of the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,  or representative of the work of a master, or possession of high artistic values, or  representative of a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may  lack individual distinction, and (d) history of yielding, or potential to yield, infor- mation important in prehistory or history. in order to be eligible for inclusion in  the nrHp, properties must also have integrity of location, design, setting, materi- als, workmanship, feeling, and association. traditional cultural properties are historic properties whose significance derives  from their association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that  (a) are rooted in that community’s history and (b) are important in the retention  and transmission of the cultural identity of the community (parker and King  1998:1). Hopi traditional cultural properties are important because they comprise  the tangible sites and places involved in passing down Hopi culture through gen- erations by oral transmission and practice. as part of their contemporary lifeway,  Hopis continue to commemorate thousands of places that are associated with  deities, shrines, historical events, water sources, mountains, ancestral villages, and  other historical and religious traditions. prior to the 1992 amendments to the nHpa, it would have been difficult for  tribes to argue the significance of traditional places. However, with these amend- ments, which formally acknowledged the significance of traditional cultural prop- erties as historic properties, tribes have had greater opportunities to argue for the  values of these sites. nevertheless, the significance of individual properties still has  to be determined on a case-by-case basis. </page> <page sequence="7"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 39 reConsTruCTIng hoPITuTskwa: buIldIng a regIonal PersPeCTIve i think there’s a tendency to lock ourselves into the political boundaries of a  project area . . . but in terms of good management, [federal agencies] need  to create a long-term, if not a short-term, goal to sponsor ethnographic  overviews regionally . . . [every place] represents a chapter in our history,  but the regional interest of the Hopi people is really, really huge. during my  tenure with the office, i’ve learned to appreciate the breadth of our cultural  and clan history, and it’s our job to try to continue to represent the Hopi  people’s interest regionally. (Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma, director of Hopi  cultural preservation office [Kuwanwisiwma 2011]) The Hopi cultural landscape was created through generations of experience and  encounters with the world. Like other communities, members of the Hopi tribe  understand the land in relation to specific events and historical conditions that  provide the context for cultural comprehension (bender 1993:2). in Hopi society,  knowledge is privileged and hierarchical, and multiple accounts of history and reli- gion exist. individual clan histories, gender, and the cultural and religious standing  of a person influence the way he or she understands the world. The participation of  the Hopi tribe in cultural preservation projects enables tribal members to identify  and reconnect with places on the land that they know through oral traditions, and  the Hopi tribal council recognizes and encourages the role of villages, clans, and  religious societies in their efforts to do this (Hopi tribe 1994). The history of Hopi people embedded in the land creates a storied landscape.  features on the land serve as metonyms for cultural concepts; they evoke images of  named places, the values associated with them, and the stories embedded in them  (Whiteley 2011; Young 1988). in this sense, each place has a far-reaching impact on  the Hopi people. ancestral villages and other archaeological sites represent meta- phorical footprints, marking the migrations of Hopi ancestors to the center of the  universe on the Hopi Mesas. These ancient footprints continue to provide spiritual  strength to the Hopi people, and they are integral in understanding the history of  the land (colwell-chanthaphonh and ferguson 2006; gumerman et al. 2012). The Hopi cultural preservation office has participated in numerous historic  preservation projects as part of the compliance process with the nrHp. tribal  members corroborate traditional knowledge with archaeological information to  identify Hopi traditional cultural properties and evaluate their eligibility for the  national register of Historic places. Here we discuss three projects conducted near  the Hopi reservation, including the black Mesa project, the Us 160 road improve- ment project, and a traditional land use study in glen canyon national recreation  area. These three projects identified traditional cultural properties in relation to  </page> <page sequence="8"> 40 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL Hopi concepts of landscape and cultural identity, elucidating the connections  between individual sites and the regional context of Hopitutskwa. the black Mesa project The black Mesa project was designed to develop a new source of water for use  in conveying coal from the black Mesa Mine, located north of the Hopi Mesas, to  the Mohave generating station at Laughlin, nevada. The black Mesa project is a  federal undertaking because it requires a permit from the office of surface Mining.  The proposed undertaking entails several distinct project components (figure 3.2),  one of which is the development of a proposed Well field with up to twelve wells  adjacent to canyon diablo near Leupp, arizona. another component includes the  construction of a water supply line, approximately 173 kilometers (108 miles) in  length to convey between 6,000 to 11,600 acre feet of water from the Well field to  the black Mesa Mine. The preferred route for this water supply line runs northward  up the oraibi Wash through the Hopi reservation, while an alternative route runs  entirely through the navajo reservation to the west of the Hopi reservation. in  order to pump water uphill to the mine, two pumping stations need to be con- structed along the water supply line, requiring the construction of a sixty-nine kilo- volt power line along much of the route. The final component of the project is the  reconstruction of the coal slurry pipeline of 439 kilometers (273 miles) from the  black Mesa Mine to the Mohave generating station. The black Mesa project runs through the heart of Hopitutskwa and includes  areas within and around the Hopi reservation. The Hopi cultural preservation  office conducted a study to identify traditional cultural properties in the project  area to facilitate compliance with section 106 of the nrHp and provide environ- mental information for implementation of the national environmental policy  act. a total of fifteen Hopi tribal members participated in fieldwork, representing  thirteen clans from seven villages on second and Third Mesa. The research teams  that worked on different project components varied in order to include Hopi  consultants knowledgeable about clan interests in different areas (ferguson and  Koyiyumptewa 2007). interviews were conducted with twenty-eight Hopi tribal  members representing thirteen clans from five villages on second and Third Mesa. as a result of the study, the Hopi tribe identified sixty-nine traditional cultural  properties, including ancestral sites, pilgrimage routes, farm fields, eagle-collecting  areas, plant- and mineral-collecting areas, landforms, shrines, and offering places.  a cultural landscape perspective was used to evaluate the results of fieldwork and  place individual traditional cultural properties in a broad cultural context. While  the land and its features were delineated using traditional cultural properties as  </page> <page sequence="9"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 41 Figure 3.2.

Hopi  concerns encompassed both the land itself and how individuals perceive the land  given their particular values and beliefs. Hopi cultural advisors recommended for  the traditional cultural properties they identified in the project area to be eligible  for the nrHp under criterion a for their association with important events in  Hopi history, and under criterion d for yielding, or having potential to yield, sig- nificant information about Hopi history. Us 160 in 2007, the Hopi cultural preservation office participated in a study along a  stretch of Us Highway 160 slated for improvement from its junction with Us 89 to  the four corners, north of the Hopi reservation (figure 3.2). This project was con- ducted in compliance with section 106 of the nrHp because the highway easement  passes through land that is under federal jurisdiction. a total of twelve Hopi tribal  </page> <page sequence="10"> 42 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL members participated in the fieldwork, representing seven clans from eight villages  on first, second, and Third Mesa. oral interviews were conducted with six Hopi  tribal members representing four clans from five villages on second and Third Mesa. The Us 160 project corridor passes through a region that is culturally significant  for the Hopi people, both in the past and the present. during the project, Hopi  cultural advisors identified 122 traditional cultural properties, including numer- ous ancestral sites, eagle-collecting areas, ceremonial collecting areas, hunting  areas, pilgrimage routes, and landforms with cultural significance. sixty-nine Hopi  place-names were also documented in the area surrounding the project corridor  (ferguson et al. 2007). as with research conducted during the black Mesa project,  Hopi cultural advisors discussed the complexity of the cultural geography in the  project area and its inextricable relationships with natural landforms, history, ani- mal life, human society, and the spiritual realm. The traditional cultural properties  identified in the Us 160 corridor were recommended eligible for the nrHp under  criteria a and d by the Hopi cultural preservation office. The Us 160 Hopi traditional cultural property study is important because it  demonstrates how ancestral sites, sacred areas, and other places with traditional cul- tural significance are used in the retention and transmission of Hopi culture. These  traditional cultural properties are integral components of the cultural landscapes  that figure prominently in Hopi history, ceremonial life, and subsistence practices.  When the results of the Us 160 project are combined with those of the black Mesa  project, the richness of Hopis’ cultural landscape becomes increasingly evident. glen canyon a third project, undertaken by the Hopi tribe in 2011, was sponsored by the  national park service (nps) at glen canyon national recreation area (gLca)  and rainbow bridge national Monument (rabr). This project was conducted as  part of an ongoing process by the national park service to maintain relationships  between traditionally associated peoples and park resources. The project was car- ried out in compliance with section 110 of the nrHp and other nps policies. a  total of four Hopi tribal members participated in the fieldwork, representing four  clans from four villages on first, second, and Third Mesa (figure 3.3). oral inter- views were conducted with fifteen Hopi tribal members representing thirteen clans  from seven villages on second and Third Mesa (Hopkins et al. 2013). glen canyon national recreation area encompasses the area around Lake  powell in Utah and arizona, covering 1.25 million acres (505,868 hectares) of  colorado plateau desert (figure 3.3). approximately 13 percent of gLca is cur- rently inundated by the waters of Lake powell as a result of the construction of  </page> <page sequence="11"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 43 Figure 3.3.

Hopi ancestors settled  the land now encompassed by gLca and rabr during the time of clan migra- tions, and many of the sites and topographic features in this region now serve as  landmarks commemorating this history. as a result of the project, Hopi cultural advisors identified ancestral sites, plants,  animals, minerals, and landforms with significance in Hopi history and tradi- tions. The study also enriched the scholarly understanding of a cultural landscape  related to the story of tiyo, an oral tradition that entails the migration history  of Hopis’ rattlesnake clan. The landscape described in this story is particularly  important because it covers an area that ranges from the southwestern United  states to Mesoamerica, revealing the expansiveness of certain understandings of  Hopitutskwa (Hopkins 2012). toko’navi, or navajo Mountain, is located at the southern edge of gLca, east  of rainbow bridge (figure 3.4). This mountain is an important landmark in the  </page> <page sequence="12"> 44 HopKins,  KoYiYUMpteWa, HedQUist,  fergUson,  and coLWeLL Figure 3.4. toko’navi (Navajo Mountain) with Colorado River and Lake Powell in the  foreground.

Hopi  people recount that the Mountain Lion and the dove people were among the first  to arrive at toko’navi during ancestral migrations, followed by the rattlesnake clan,  and the sand clan (stephen 1936:1084). The late ferrell secakuku, a member of the  rattlesnake clan, was taught that Hopi clans initially settled at toko’navi because  of its resemblance to palatkwapi, (the red Walled city) a place where many clans  lived previously (secakuku 2006). Hopi ancestors who lived at toko’navi are associated with the story of tiyo,  the legend of a boy who traveled the full length of the colorado river to  Mesoamerica, returning with a snake wife, establishing the rattlesnake clan, and  introducing the snake dance into Hopi religion (anyon 1999; bourke [1884]  1984:177; ferguson 1998:107–19; Hopkins 2012; parsons 1939:975; secakuku  2006). oral traditions describe toko’navi as the place where tiyo lived before  embarking on his journey down the colorado river (courlander 1971:82; fewkes  1900:588–89; Yava 1978:55). The colorado river is known to Hopis as pisisvayu, and it is one of the two  principal drainages in gLca. While looking at the river, one Hopi cultural advi- sor participating in the project remembered that there were several deities who  helped tiyo during his arduous journey, including Huru’ingwùuti (Hard objects  </page> <page sequence="13"> Hopi ancestors LiVed in tHese canYons 45 Woman), Kòokyangwso’wùuti (old spider Woman), and pöqangwhoya and  palöngawhoya (the Warrior twins). Viewing the land vividly recalls the spiritual  beings associated with it. tiyo brought back, Qa’toya, a dragon-like deity, from his journeys to the south.  Qa’toya is associated with the rattlesnake clan and possesses the powers to make  rain. turkey-like tracks depicted in petroglyphs are said to be the footprints of this  deity. a cave located on toko’navi was once the residing place of Qa’toya. When  the rattlesnake clan left toko’navi, the creature flew out of his cave and traveled  down the colorado river to the Little colorado river, ending up at Wupatki, a  Hopi ancestral site located along the Little colorado river west of the Hopi Mesas.  The rattlesnake clan followed Qa’toya to Wupatki and stayed there for some time  before continuing toward the Hopi Mesas. rattlesnake clan members believe that  Qa’toya still resides at Wupatki. a pictograph at an ancient site in gLca reminded cultural advisors of Qa’toya  (figure 3.5). a snake image and a migration symbol were also present at the site, as  were the images of anthropomorphic figures holding weapons (figure 3.6). Members  of the rattlesnake clan today are known as “Hopi warriors,” and cultural advisors  participating in fieldwork at gLca believed that these images were all related to  this clan’s history in the area. toko’navi, the ancient home of the rattlesnake clan,  is visible from this site. We found that talking about the land with Hopi research  participants provided a meaningful context for talking about Hopi history. The glen canyon study revealed a tangible connection between Hopi history  and the resources in gLca. equally important were the cognitive associations  made by Hopi tribal members between natural and cultural resources of gLca  and distant places known and maintained through Hopi oral traditions. dIsCussIon and ConClusIon Those [tracks] are our connections to [our ancestral] places, and we still  honor those places today. We make prayer feathers for all of those places and  deposit them and give thanks to all the places that we still remember. and  those are the reasons why we have shrines around our communities; they  become these places that we make our prayers to. (Leonard talaswaima  [talaswaima 2011]) as access to Hopi traditional lands has become increasingly restricted due to  changes in land tenure over time, the Hopi people have struggled to maintain their  historical traditions based on cultural practices associated with the land.

The Hopi tribe’s participation in historic preservation projects for the black  Mesa, Us Highway 160, and glen canyon national recreation area projects has  identified numerous traditional cultural properties within and outside the Hopi  reservation. specific sites and landforms in glen canyon articulate Hopi land  and identity through their relationship with the story of tiyo and the rattlesnake  clan’s migration history. as richard clemmer (1993:86) noted, “Hopis identify  their ancestral dwelling places as much by symbols etched into rock and architec- tural ruins as by clan legends and traditions. in a sense, knowledgeable Hopis ‘read’  an archaeological landscape with reference to the fundamental principles of their  cosmological system.” </page> <page sequence="15"> Figure 3.6.

Visiting places not only  reaffirms Hopi responsibilities of land stewardship but can also serve as a process  of historic revelation. a comparable moment was recorded in australia by Howard  Morphy (1995), who documented how narritjin Maymuru, a Yolngu man, discov- ers that a mythic event had transpired in a place he had never been before. Maymuru  knew because he believed that he was not moving into a new country, but that the  land was revealing itself to him. in other words, the past—real and tangible—was  being transmitted through the physical place. such processes of blending stories,  experience, and landscapes have been documented in other cultural contexts (e.g.,  basso 1996; cruikshank 2005; Wyndham 2011). The Hopis use a similar mecha- nism. The retention and transmission of Hopi culture depend largely on the Hopis’  ability to connect to their ancestral landscape. reFerenCes anyon, roger. 1999.
