<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory by Shira Wolosky Gershom Scholem, in his personal accounts, retells several times that he first planned to write his dissertation on the linguistic theory of the Kabbalah, but gave up the project in consideration of the difficulty and his own still beginning knowledge of this subject.1 Forty years later he did at last devote a full length essay to language theory, "The Name of God and the Linguistic Theory of the Kabbalah". This is not to say, however, that he had neglected the topic through the intervening period. The question of language, its struc ture and its claims, its status and its parameters, is a pivotal concern in Scholem, one that emerges persistently through work after work - indeed as integral aspects to other, more widely discussed interests. In many senses, Gershom Scholem's way into the Kabbalah followed the paths of language. Scholem in his guise as interpreter of Judaism is in fact, as David Biale observes, essentially a philosopher of language.2 Or, more specifically, what Scholem offers is a theology of language: not only concerning the (necessary) role language plays in all theologies, but how in the Kabbalah, as Scholem interprets it, an extensive theology of language takes shape, ultimately en tailing quite specific commitments and axiologies. Scholem's linguistic theory - and it is as a full-fledged theory of language I wish to thank the Center for Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania; and the Einstein Forum, Potsdam, for Fellowship Support for work on this essay.

Subsequent research has raised questions on matters ranging from Scholem's dating and sequence of manuscripts, to his understanding of the origins and influences in the Kabbalah of other sources and religious or philosophical tendencies; to dis putes over broad claims such as the role of messianism, the structure of mystical experience, or the relation of history itself to the Kabbalah. Scholem, however, is not only an historian of the Kabbalah, but a religious thinker and linguistic theorist, although to be sure these cannot be simply discon nected from each other.3 As Scholem himself wrote in his 1937 "Candid Letter" to Schocken, it was his intention to write not (only) "the history of Kabbalah but rather its metaphysics" (OP 4). Here, I will be considering not Scholem's history or historiography of the Kabbalah, but rather the coherence of Scholem's own interpretive system, its principles and implications, the structure and place of his linguistic theory within his general project, and also its relation to broad trends in twentieth-century theory. For Scholem's work has strong links with central aspects of contemporary theoretical work, intersecting with it in striking and consequential ways. From the perspective of contemporary discourses, terms and structures of Scholem's linguistic thought gain in rigor and clarity. At the same time, Scholem's writing clarifies and illuminates sources and con cerns in current discussions of language and interpretation, both conceptually and in relation to the history of religious discourses, and not least Judaic ones. Current thinking about language crucially grapples with the critique of metaphysics launched most dramatically by Nietzsche. It attempts a con struction of meaning within an overarching crisis in metaphysics, trying to make sense of experience given a post-Nietzschean rejection of traditional metaphysical ontology and references as no longer viable. Scholem's work belongs within this response to metaphysical crisis. He confronts it, however, from viewpoints and tendencies long lived within Judaic cultural life. His theory of language is thus situated at once in Judaic sources, yet also immediately in the most current concerns regarding the consequences of post metaphysical challenges to the very possibility of meaning. In this, his work brings together Judaic and contemporary discourses in a powerful cross cultural reflection. 3 For an overview of discussions on the relationship between Scholem's historiography and his theology see Daniel Abrams, "Presenting and Representing Gershom Scholem: A Review Essay", Modern Judaism, Vol. 20, No. 243, 2 (May 2000), pp. 226-243. [166*]</page><page sequence="3">3] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory Scholem's theory of language proposes three core principles, which are also interrelated. These are: (1) the ontology of language; (2) hermeneutic multiplicity; and (3) a negative theory or theology of representation. These do not of course exhaust all of Scholem's linguistic topics and their relation ships to further concerns. He himself elaborates these principles through their religious history, tracking and describing their sequent appearances from text to text across different periods. They nevertheless form a systematic set of theoretical commitments, conceptual as well as historical, as the basis of his various discussions on language, interrelated with other topics which may not be explicitly linguistic but are linked to its domain. 1. The Ontology of Language Among the most powerful and impelling images in Scholem's representation of the Kabbalah - and one which closely connects it to the world of con temporary theory - is the vision of the world as made up of letters, as textual in its very being. "It is a world of words to the end of it", writes the twentieth century poet Wallace Stevens. The Sefiroth loom in the kabbalistic imaginings of divine activity and the 'shapes' of the divine life. But Scholem underscores that the divine life was expressed not only through the ten configurations of the Sefiroth, but also in terms of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet (in imagery going back to the Sefer Yetzirah if not before). The Sefiroth them selves are in this sense linguistically constituted, as manifestations of the divine in letters. This is the point with which Scholem begins the second section of his essay on "The Name of God": In the Sefiroth of the Kabbalists, God manifests himself in ten spheres or aspects of his activity. The 22 letters are themselves part and parcel of this area; they are configurations of the divine energies, which are themselves grounded in the world of the Sefiroth, and whose appear ance in the world either beyond, outside, or beneath this realm of the divine emanations is simply a gradual process of de-refinement and an intensified crystallization of these innermost signs of all things, as they correspond to the progressively evolving and increasingly con densed media of the creation.4 While the Sefiroth and the letters make up two different systems, they never theless are inextricably related one to the other. "The Sefiroth and the letters, 4 Gershom Scholem, "The Name of God and the Linguistic Theory of the Kabbalah", Diogenes, 79/80 (1972), pp. 59-80, 164-194, p. 165 (hereafter cited as N). [167*]</page><page sequence="4">Shira Wolosky [4 in which the word of God is explained, or which constitute the word of God, were simply two different methods in which the same reality might be rep resented in a symbolic manner" (N 165). These letters in turn connect to the mysticism of the Names of God: what the letters of divinity express are (also) divine Names. As he puts it in his essay "On the Meaning of the Torah", "The process which the Kabbalists described as the emanation of divine energy and divine light was also characterized as divine language... They speak of attributes and of spheres of light; but in the same context they speak also of divine names and the letters of which they are composed... The secret world of the godhead is a world of language".5 Most radically, this linguistic activity of divine expression becomes the very substance and structure of the world. Language emerges as basic material and also formative energy of created reality.6 It is a primary ontological prin ciple, forming the components which weave the very fabric of the world. In ontological terms, "The letters of the divine language are what lie at the basis of all creation by way of their combination" (N 71). Creation itself is the "activeness of the divine language, of the self-differentiating word of the creation". "The movement in which the creation comes about can therefore also be interpreted and explained in terms of a linguistic movement" (N 165). The ancient and, as Scholem notes, potently magical notion of the divine Name emerges in Kabbalah as a cosmogonic principle making up the world's very substance. As Scholem puts it in his introductory chapter to Major Trends: "All creation - and this is an important principle of most Kabbalists - is, from the point of view of God, nothing but an expression of His hidden self that begins and ends by giving itself a name, the holy name of God, the perpetual act of creation".7 There has been much discussion about the relation in Scholem between mystical traditions and Rabbinic and Halachic norms. Moshe Idel and Eliezer Schweid both see Scholem's as a rather negative attitude toward Rabbinics and Halachah;8 and Scholem does indeed seem to view these as somewhat On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (NY: Schocken Books, 1965), pp. 35-36 (hereafter cited as KS). Moshe Idel distinguishes these two aspects, the formative and the material, in his essay "Reification of Language in Jewish Mysticism" in Steven Katz. ed. Mysticism and Lan .47 .guage (NY: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 42-79, p NY: Schocken Books, 1954), p. 17 (hereafter cited) נMajor Trends in Jewish Mysticism as MJT).

Halachah of course never has been such a merely formal system, but always a form of life for those living it. But here I think we see one of the deep marks left on Scholem by his early experience of bourgeois German Jewish culture. This he saw as a thin, self-deceiving, even repulsive betrayal of Jewish life and history into the bare veneer of Wissenschaftig "spiritual essence" (OP 115)9 and empty Reform gestures. Despite this, however, Scholem goes out of his way to underscore the links between mystical lin guistic ontology and Rabbinic sources. He cites the familiar midrashim of the creation of the world out of letters, of the use of Torah as a model for created reality, of Bezalel creating the mishkan.10 Severe tensions do obtain between Rabbinics and Kabbalism, which can be specified through definite structures within the theory of linguistic meaning Scholem offers or implies. But Scholem does not necessarily see the two as intrinsically or necessarily opposed one against the other. "The Kabbalists", he writes, "were in no sense of the word heretics. Rather, they strove to penetrate, more deeply than their predecessors, into the meaning of Jewish concepts... [They] merely have drawn the final consequence from the assumption of the Talmudists con cerning Revelation and tradition as religious categories'"1 - a "final conse quence" which can still of course be a mode of subversion.

Scholem goes out of his way to link kabbalistic positions to talmudic and midrashic antecedents. In "The Name of God", he emphasizes that already in "strictly rabbinical Judaism" there existed a mysticism of divine Names. He recalls a midrashic saying that "before the Creation, God and his name existed alone" (Pirkei Rabbi Eli'ezer chapter 3) (70). In the Talmud it is written of Bezalel that he "knew how to put together the letters, from which heaven and earth were created" (Berakhoth 55a, 71). Or again, he cites the well-known Aggadah that the Torah was written with black fire upon white fire (77), or the ancient Aggadah which saw the Torah as the "instrument of creation through which the world came into existence" (79). See also "The Meaning of Torah" where aggadic, midrashic, talmudic, and kabbalistic impulses are interwoven.

Scholem is insistent in his rejection of an essence of Judaism, declaring that Judaism has "no essence" and in fact is made up of all the movements and events, attitudes and elements that have occurred in its history, which remains open and unfinalized. Judaism is, more over, highly syncretist, incorporating and transforming in different ways at different times elements from other cultural fields. Nevertheless, there is in his work a sense that Judaism has a special and central concern with language. The "mystical contemplation of letters and their configurations, as the con stituents of God's name" undertaken by Abraham Abulafia, Scholem sees as "the peculiarly Jewish object of mystical contemplation" (MJT 132-133). Even Greek elements - Platonist and Neoplatonist in particular- incorporated into Kabbalah, take a peculiarly linguistic turn. The Sefer Yetzirah combines a "Greek philosophy" of numbers "with original Jewish thought concerning the secrets of letters and of language" (OP 131).12 If the notion of the Torah as a model for creation recalls Plato's Timaeus creation-myth, it is distinct from it exactly in that Plato makes no mention of language as an ontological principle.13 There the making of the world is imagined on a visual, not a linguistic model. As Harold Bloom points out: "An even more crucial differ ence from Neoplatonism is that all kabbalistic theories of emanation are also theories of language".14 Indeed, the status of language in Neoplatonism is far more compromised than in the Kabbalah. Plato's world of Ideas as ultimate Being is a world that ultimately negates language, whose distinctions, differentiations and materiality betray Being's intelligible unity.15 But Mystical Shape of the Godhead", in On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead (NY: Schocken Books, 1991), pp. 15-55, p. 28, on the "close links between mysticism and the rabbis" (hereafter cited as MS).

Scholem's description of the mystical Torah as "the linguistic movement of Ein-Sof within itself' as a "kabbalistic version of the Platonic world of ideas", Kabbalah, (Jeru salem: Keter Publishing House, 1974), p. 132, with language marking the difference.

On the relation [170*]</page><page sequence="7">7] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory Scholem's Kabbalah runs counter to this negative view of language. Scholem in fact repeatedly emphasizes the "metaphysically positive attitude towards language as God's own instrument" as something that specifically distin guishes Jewish mysticism (MJT 15). The "point of departure" for the Kabbalists was that language is the medium in which "the spiritual life of man is accomplished"; the Kabbalists held a "superabundantly positive de lineation of language, as the 'mystery revealed' of all things that exist" (N 60, 62). "The indissoluble link between the idea of the revealed truth and the notion of language .. .is presumably one of the most important, if not the most important, legacies bequeathed by Judaism to the history of religions" (N 60). For Scholem, language constitutes in some sense the religious (as well in many ways the historical) dimension of Jewish life, with its study central to Jewish religious practice and its status unsurpassed as the mani festation of, and mode of relationship to the divine. 2. Hermeneutic Multiplicity Language as cosmogonic principle opens into Scholem's next fundamental principle, that of hermeneutic multiplication and plurality. The ontology of language effectively transforms, or casts, experience itself as fundamentally hermeneutic. The relationship to reality becomes an interpretive one. As ere ative language, the world becomes divine text, while conversely, divine text becomes world. Creation and revelation emerge as parallel, as well as inter secting. World and Torah are mutual reflections as well as extensions of each other; for both are manifestations or expressions of the divine, deriving in, and hence revealing and partaking in divine language. Therefore, both world and Torah, as grounded in divine language, have multiple, indeed in finite meanings and interpretations. Each act of language in both text and world - text as world - acquires a further depth of meaning, due to their grounding in the divine word or Name. This excess, or surplus, or supplement of meaning is foundational to Scholem's basic definition of mysticism of language as such. The "point of departure of all mystical linguistic theories", he writes in "The Name of God", is the view that language "includes an inner property, an aspect which does not altogether merge or disappear in the relationships of communication between men" (N 60). Beyond whatever instrumental function language performs, beyond language in any practical sense, there are further, uncontained dimensions - an "inner property", as ship between Platonism and language see Shira Wolosky, Language Mysticism (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994). [171*]</page><page sequence="8">Shira Wolosky [8 he writes, a "secret" or "hidden dimension of language" (N 61). There is a "dual character" of word and Name, the first a sense of communicated mean ing, the second as an expression of surplus, of further meaning beyond in strumental information - a formula, as we will go on to see, with close ties to contemporary theory.16 In Scholem's own discussion, this second, surplus meaning imbues even ordinary words, giving them added depth, what he calls later in the essay a "reflected splendor, a reflection of divine language, which coincide with one another in revelation" (N 177). Divine language opens to "infinite levels of meaning". "The language of God is an absolute; it is set forth in its manifestations in all worlds in manifold meanings; and it is from here that the language of men also derives its majesty, even if it is apparently directed at communication" (N 180). This sense of multidimensional experience is fundamental to Scholem's basic religious as well as linguistic commitment, and again refers to his re bellion against his bourgeois background and its flattening of reality to one, material level of experience. In a quite Heideggerean moment, he says in an interview; "It was clear to them [the Kabbalists] that what we would call technology could not be the last word; that if technology wishes to survive, it must reveal a symbolic dimension. This is what I would affirm in Kabbalah and reject in technology. Technology thinks it can banish the symbolic di mension" (JJ 48). As against this technological reality, he speaks of a fun damental feeling in the Kabbalah "that there is a mystery - a secret - in the world. The world is also - but not only - what is apparent to us" (JJ 48). This commitment to mystery infused his view of history - what Joseph Dan names history's mystical dimension17, which Scholem describes as "a hidden facet to the historical process taking place here that may have a religio metaphysical aspect" (JJ 43). History thus also becomes a divine text, with multiple strata inviting and generating hermeneutic experience. 3. A Negative Theory of Representation Scholem's mystical theory of language, of divine Names expressing them selves in an ontology of letters and revealed text, refracted through illimitable interpretation, ultimately entails a core principle of negation. This is the case both for the ontology and the hermeneutic that Scholem presents. Stephane Moses rightly compares this schema to the Jakobsonian distinction between poetic as against the communicative function of language, p. 250. Here, as many have discussed, Scholem also is closely connected to Benjamin. Joseph Dan. Gershom Scholem and the Mystical Dimension of History (NY: New York University Press, 1987). [172*]</page><page sequence="9">9] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory According to Scholem, at the root of kabbalistic ontology, as its creative source, there is an ontic break. All being issues forth from a transcendent origin paradoxically called Nothingness. The language of the divine Names as the material of the created world themselves derive in an ultimate Name so transcendent as to be inexpressible and beyond being. Divinity itself is drawn into a dialectic of the hidden and manifest, a doubling hinted in the term shem ha-meforash, meaning both "made known" or "pronounced"; and at the same time "separate" and "hidden" (N 68). This ultimate negation came to be called En Sof, an adverbial relation that took on nominative form.18 In this aspect, God is a deus absconditus whose Name is either known only to God himself, or who is nameless (N 175). Or, in another lettristic image, the divine source is linked to the letter Aleph as silent, a "voiceless voice input", a "point of indifference of all speaking" from which, however, all manifestation as language issues (N 170). This negative cosmogonic process has enormous resonance for Scholem. His introduction to Major Trends dramatically presents this idea of a "hidden God", unknowable "in the depths of His nothingness" (MJT 13). Indeed, as Scholem pursues, this notion of Nothingness as ground of being comes to inform the mystical interpretation of creatio ex nihilo itself, the classic locus for arguments attesting the transcendence of God in his distinction from the world He created. Creation acquires a mystical meaning as "the emergence of all things from the absolute nothingness of God". And yet, the Nothingness also preserves just that distinction which remains for Scholem a core premise or commitment. Here we find Scholem's Kabbalah at a kind of juncture between Neoplatonist, gnostic, and Jewish impulses. There are clear ties to Neoplatonist cosmology, according to which all being originates in the One which itself, however, remains beyond category or representation. But Neoplatonist emanation theory, despite these negative expressions, leaves open an ontic continuity between the One and the world of being which flows from it. Gnostic lore in contrast posits a chasm between ultimate being, hidden from manifestation, as against the created world, seen not as an expression of the ultimate God but rather as its betrayal into the alien and evil world of matter, through the action of a separate and essentially demonic Creator-demiurge.19 According to Scholem, Kabbalah resists both such K 88. There is an extended discussion of the grammars of divinity in Gershom Scholem,. "La Lutte entre le Dieu de Plotin et le Dieu de la Bible dans la Kabbale ancienne" in Les Noms et les Symbols de Dieu dans la mystique juive, Tr. Maurice R. Hayrun et Georges Vajda (Paris: Les Editions de Cerf, 1983), pp. 17-53, p. 28 (hereafter cited as Lutte). [Translations from French are my own. S.W.] Whether or not 'gnostic' in this sense represents an actual historical sect or movement. [173*]</page><page sequence="10">Shira Wolosky [10 radical dualism of gnosticism, and the ontic continuity of Neoplatonism. As to the former, Scholem insists that, despite the affinities between the kabbalistic Nothing and the gnostic hidden God, "Kabbalism is not dualistic", and "is bent on the task of escaping dualistic consequences" of a complete opposition between the ultimate God and the Creator (MJT 13; OP 127; MS 34). Yet interruption between these two is also maintained, as against a Neoplatonist emanation that too directly flows into pantheist unity between creation and cause. As David Biale explains of Scholem's 5th and 7th Unhis torical Aphorisms, Scholem's Kabbalah posits a "dialectical theology which is notably absent in neoplatonism ... Without a dialectical moment - a mo ment of non-Being - the One would 'swallow up' the Many".20 In Kabbalah, Scholem brings together many strands of his negative argu ment, which he goes so far as to call a "mystical agnosticism" (Cf. Lutte 267). "God in himself, in his absolute Essence, lies beyond any speculative or even ecstatic comprehension", an "absolute perfection" which "does not reveal itself in a way that makes knowledge of its nature possible, and it is not accessible even to the innermost thought of the contemplative ... Only through the finite nature of every existing thing, through the actual experience of creation itself, is it possible to deduce the existence of En-Sof as the first infinite cause" (K 88-89). But this is to remove God rather severely from all expression - a stance which becomes in Scholem a quite radical theory of negative representation and indeed of language generally. In a sense, Scholem here is like Maimon ides: he sets up a guard against the claims of language to penetrate and image the divine.21 On the one hand language is a bridge, the crucial link to the divine. "Only the voice of God, and no other shape, reaches across the abyss of transcendence bridged by revelation", as Scholem writes in his essay "On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead" (MS 16-17; cf. MJT 7; K 170, 173). Yet, if language is a bridge, it is also a barrier. For language will inevitably represent God not in terms of himself, but in our terms; not in his transcend in Scholem it is used to refer to such radical dualisms. See Michael Williams. Rethinking "Gnosticism" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996). David Biale, "Gershom Scholenfs Ten Unhistorical Aphorisms on Kabbalah", reprinted in Harold Bloom. Gershom Scholem (NY: Chelsea House, 1987), pp. 99-123, pp. 115-120. Biale himself, however, in some of his commentary, seems to reduce this radical dialectic, as when he writes that "the relationship between human language and divine language ... makes it possible to comprehend the divine essence", p. 119. See David Biale. Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982) for discussion of Scholem and Maimonides, p. 131, and fn 83. [174*]</page><page sequence="11">11] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory ence, but in his manifestation. "Any discussion of God must necessarily use the imagery of the created world, because we have no other", Scholem writes. There is an inescapable catachresis, or resort to anthropomorphism, an in evitable "application of human language to God" (MS 15). Even in the de scriptions of God through physical measurements, such as occur in Shiur Komah, the representation is finally unmasked as failing to represent. "In reality, though, all measurements fail, and the strident anthropomorphism is suddenly and paradoxically transformed into its opposite". Representation negates its own claims: "That is why we have no measurement, and only names are revealed to us" (MS 24—25). As he pursues in Kabbalah, "All Kabbalists agree that no religious knowledge of God, even of the most exalted kind, can be gained except through contemplation of the relationship of God to creation. God in Himself, the absolute Essence, lies beyond any speculative or even ecstatic comprehension". With regard to divine things, language is at most only figural, "not an objective description of a process in Ein-Sof' but only what "could be conjectured from the perspective of created beings and was expressed through their ideas, which in reality cannot be applied to God at all. Therefore descriptions of these processes have only a symbolic, or at best, an approximate value" (K 88, 90). Or again, as he writes in Major Trends׳. "While the living God, the God of religion of whom these [sacred] writings bear witness, has innumerable names;... the deus absconditus, the God who is hidden in His own self, can only be named in a metaphorical sense and with the help of words which, mystically speaking, are not real names at all" (MJT 12). This negative representation has, in this sense, profoundly positive effects. For one thing, it provides the ground and possibility for exactly the multiplicity which is so fundamental both to Scholem's ontology and his hermeneutic. It is just this utter negativity which opens the infinities of meanings that the language worlds articulate. Scholem refers, with considerable drama, to this negative, ultimate divine as "meaninglessness" (KS 43), not as a denial of meaning, but as its very source and authorization.22 "The Name", Scholem writes in Major Trends, "through which everything else acquires its meaning ... yet to the human mind has no concrete, particular meaning of its own" (MJT 133). More radically, Scholem speaks, in a letter to Walter Benjamin, of the "nothingness of revelation", which "appears to be without meaning" 22 "The Torah is an absolute and has primacy over all human interpretations, which, however deep they may penetrate, can only approximate the absolute ־meaninglessness' of the divine revelation" (KS 43). [175*]</page><page sequence="12">Shira Wolosky [12 - having "validity but no significance".23 And yet, it is only as meaningless that the absolute permits, indeed generates, the fullness of interpretive pos sibilities, undelimited by finite specificity. For a fixed and determinate mean ing would by definition constrain interpretations to conform to it. Meaning lessness thus becomes the core hermeneutic principle. As Scholem writes in "The Name of God", This name has no "meaning" in the traditional understanding of the term. It has no concrete signification. The meaninglessness of the name of God indicates its situation in the very central point of the revelation, at the basis of which it lies. Behind every revelation of a meaning in language, and as the Kabbalists saw it, by means of the Torah, there exists this element which projects over and beyond meaning, but which in the first instance enables meaning to be given. It is this element which endows every other meaning though it has no meaning itself. What we learn from creation and revelation, the word of God, is in finitely liable to interpretation, and is reflected in our own language (N 193-194). The model of multidimensional meaning, of interpretive multiplicity, rests on the ground of a core inaccessibility, or incomprehensibility. It is trans cendent "meaninglessness" that creates an "element over and beyond mean ing", a surplus beyond instrumental communication, which Scholem earlier called the "quality of dignity", "a dimension inherent to itself' that the mystic finds in language: "something pertaining to its structure which is not adjusted to a communication of what is communicable, but rather ... to a communi cation of what is non-communicable, of that which exists within it for which there is no expression; and even if it could be expressed, it would in no way have any meaning, or any communicable sense" (N 61). David Kaufmann, in his essay on "Scholem in the Wake of Philosophy", explores how negation in Scholem is a generative principle, "grounding all positivity". Its very negativity, as having itself no determinate meaning, opens the way to its infinite expression. Kaufmann, however, emphasizes the cog nitive aspect of this "negative theology of pure transcendence", such that the "noncognitive and unrepresentable aspect of God" is retained, even as it remains "the sign of the transcendent base of all immanence" (152-153).24 23 This is an often discussed letter to Walter Benjamin, The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem (NY: Schocken Books, 1989), Sept 20, 1934. See for example Robert Alter, Necessary Angels (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). p. 108. 24 David Kaufmann, "Scholem in the Wake of Philosophy", Modern Judaism, 20:2 (May [176*]</page><page sequence="13">13] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory But the problem is equally linguistic, where cognition itself depends upon language forms. The unrepresentability of the Absolute as beyond language and hence without "meaning" is what authorizes and generates all linguistic activity, in the world and in man. This, then, is the positive side of negation. Not denial of meaning, but its ground, is posited in the originary Nothingness of divine revelation; as a linguistic movement taking shape out of, and at testing to, a divinity that remains beyond all words, but which also guarantees their significance.25 In this appeal to the Nothing, Scholem himself emerges as a negative theologian of language, with the world a linguistic expression of a divine that remains, however, beyond. Yet the negative in Scholem remains ambiguous, retaining a destructive force not fully contained, as it wavers between a tautological, rather than a paradoxical, absence: one not of consequential concealment, but rather of nihilism. In his 1937 letter to Shocken, Scholem had aligned himself with "those mystical theses that lie on the narrow boundary between religion and nihilism" (OP 3). In this he joins with other modern theorists of language whose work, like Scholem's, is deeply enmeshed with metaphysics, which is to say with modern metaphysical crisis. As with them, his work is both a product of and a response to such crisis, at once resisting, yet at the risk of nihilism. 4. Scholem and Contemporary Linguistic Theory Scholem's relation to contemporary theory is both generative and congruent. This is most evident in Scholem's multi-directional involvement with Walter Benjamin, which has yet to be fully sorted out.26 Harold Bloom openly ac 2000), pp. 147-158, pp. 153, 154. As Kaufmann writes, "the mystical nothing of pure transcendence predominates in all Scholem's discussions of what he takes to be authentic or living religion", p. 154. 25 Shaul Magid seems to confuse this point when he writes that "Scholem argues that the experience of the amorphous moment has no intrinsic meaning or worth", "Gershom Scholem's Ambivalence Toward Mystical Experience and His Critique of Martin Buber in Light of Hans Jonas and Martin Heidegger", The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy, no. 4 (1995), pp. 245-269, p. 254. 26 Scholem at least implies that the influence between himself and Benjamin was reciprocal, Story, pp. 92,113.

As Bloom underscores, Scholem's Kabbalah offers a "body of rhetoric or fig urative language" (2), with the Sefiroth themselves linguistic in nature, "com plex figurations for God, tropes or turns of language, that substitute for God" (6-7); and the Kabbalah as having "continued relevance... for contemporary modes of interpretation". (2)27 And Derridean sign-theory intersects with Scholem in compelling ways, helping to chart Scholem's linguistic models and to pursue them into the metaphysical and axiological terrain they so deeply inhabit. Scholem's theory of an excess of meaning in language, over and above whatever communicative information language may convey, is deeply bound up with Walter Benjamin's linguistic theory, as has been often remarked. Benjamin, in "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man", proposes a notion of symbol as a surplus of meaning reverberating through all discourse which is very close to Scholem's: "Language is in every case not only the communication of the communicable, but also, at the same time, a symbol of the noncommunicable".28 This formulation recalls the Jakobsonian dis tinction between poetic and communicative functions of language, as Stephane Moses has pointed out.29 Yet Benjamin, like Scholem, claims far more than a descriptive linguistics. Benjamin's notion of "language as an ultimate reality, perceptible only in its manifestation, inexplicable and mys tical" (Reflections 322) joins Scholem's in its assertion of a linguistic ontology, as a substratum of reality itself, conceived as Name, through which the hidden divine language glimmers, and in so doing orientates all reality as linguistic: "The uninterrupted flow of this communication runs through the whole of nature from the lowest forms of existence to man and from man to God. Man communicates himself to God through name". As in Scholem, this linguistic ontology issues forth from a source that itself remains Zwischen den Disziplinen, pp. 176-256, where language is discussed pp. 196-197. Wohlfarth's interpretation of Scholera is largely through the lens of Benjamin. See also Susan Handelman, Fragments of Redemption (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1991), pp. 82-92.

And, it is only experienced as fragmentary, represented only "in em bryonic or intensive form", as Benjamin writes;30 or, as Scholem writes in his Ninth Unhistorical Aphorism, "Only as fragmentary is this language expressible". Benjamin opposes himself against what he calls a "bourgeois" linguistic theory in which language is "mere signs" (Reflections 324). Yet he also writes that "the language of art can be understood only in the deepest rela tionship to the doctrine of sign because the relationship between language and sign ... is original and fundamental" (Reflections 331). Indeed, it is in terms of signs that Benjamin announces his theory of symbolic language: "The symbolic side of language is connected to its relation to signs, but extends more widely, for example, in certain respects, to name and judgment. These have not only a communicating function, but most probably also a closely connected symbolic function". In fact, sign-theory, or rather its cri tique as undertaken by Derrida, can powerfully clarify Scholem's linguistic theory: in terms of his discussions of symbols, and generally, in regard to his hermeneutic, and his theology of language as a whole. Derrida's critique begins with Saussure's theory of the sign as the relation - or juncture - between a "signifier" - the linguistic indicator - and a "signified" - the idea or reference indicated. This structure is, according to Derrida, fundamentally metaphysical. As he summarizes in his interview with Kristeva in Positions: "The sign, by its root and its implications, is in all its aspects metaphysical, [and] is in systematic solidarity with stoic and medieval theology".31 The Saussurean "signified" as an "idea" seems to exist before and outside its representation, in itself, as if beyond the modes or procedures of how it comes to be signified. It thus occupies a place, or derives in a notion, of metaphysical order, reenacting ontological assumptions. The signified, that is, reproduces a Platonic realm of intelligible, eternal Ideas, beyond and determining their material, temporal, differentiated representa tions in things and in words. But Derrida rejects such metaphysical ontologies, along with the signified and the structure of signification conceived as based in it, as its representation. In him a signified no longer is thought to stand behind or before the sign, which are no longer thought to signify a prior 30 Walter Benjamin, Illuminations, ed. Hannah Arendt (NY: Schocken Books, 1969), p. 72. 31 Jacques Derrida, "Semiology and Grammatology", Positions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 15-36, p. 17 (hereafter cited as Pos). [179*]</page><page sequence="16">Shira Wolosky [16 reference, as exterior and secondary to it. Instead, significance unfolds in a chain of signifiers, each referring to each other, and none beyond the signi fying process itself. As to their origin, this remains absent, in a negation that remains highly ambiguous in Derrida. The signifiers never directly represent a "signified" outside the process of signification itself. Yet the signifiers also emerge as a "trace" of this non-ontological origin, as its "mark". This "trace", although it "encloses the meaning of Being", itself "no longer belongs to the horizon of Being". It acts, instead, as a negation, a "Nothing - no present and in-different being", which "precedes difference" (Pos 28). The trace in itself, as he pursues in his essay "Difference", "has no meaning and is not": Each so-called "present" element, each element appearing on the scene of presence, is related to something other than itself, thereby keeping within itself the mark of the past element,... this trace being related no less to what is called the future than to what is called the past, and constituting what is called the present by means of this very relation to what it is not: what it absolutely is not.32 As Derrida himself remarks, his own discourses, as here, can recall "those of negative theology, occasionally even to the point of being indistinguishable from negative theology" (Diff 6). Yet - as in Scholem - Derrida's negativity should be distinguished from that of classic negative theology, which remains fundamentally ontological, and whose negation, as such, finally negates the reality of the world of and as signs.33 As in Scholem, reality itself emerges as a series, or rather passage, of signs; and experience of reality is herme neutic, the world a text, or as Derrida puts the question: "How to conceive what is outside a text?" (Diff 25). Derridean critique has broad implications for Scholem's work, from spe cific linguistic structures to their farthest metaphysical implications. There is, to begin, a profound clarification and sharpening of Scholem's use of the terms symbol and allegory, which he took from Goethean Romanticism. Scholem famously defines symbol Jacques Derrida, "Difference", Margins of Philosophy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 1-28, pp. 22, 12-13 (hereafter cited as Diff). Shira Wolosky, "An Other Negative Theology", Poetics Today, 19:2 (Summer 1998), pp. 261-280. Of Grammatology (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976) (hereafter cited as OG), remains a central text for explicating this theological dimension of the sign.

[180*]</page><page sequence="17">17] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory as a reality which in itself has, for us, no form or shape [but] becomes transparent and, as it were, visible, through the medium of another reality which clothes its content with visible and expressible meaning... The thing which becomes a symbol retains its original form and its original content. It does not become, so to speak, an empty shell into which another content is poured; in itself, through its own existence, it makes another reality transparent which cannot appear in any other form. As against symbol, Scholem opposes allegory: That which is expressed by and in the allegorical sign is in the first instance something which has its own meaningful context, but by be coming allegorical that something loses its own meaning and becomes the vehicle of something else ... If allegory can be defined as the representation of an expressible something by another expressible something, the mystical symbol is an expressible representation of something which lies beyond the sphere of expression and communi cation ... A hidden and inexpressible reality finds its expression in the symbol. If the symbol is thus also a sign or representation it is never theless more than that (MJT 26-27). As Moshe Idel has pointed out, it is impossible fully to distinguish these two modes of representation, either theoretically or practically, in their usage within kabbalistic tradition.34 Such theoretical confusion, or rather penetra tion, between symbol and allegory is upheld by contemporary discussions, since even in allegory signifier and signified impinge upon each other, mu tually shaping and reciprocally participating in the significating process. Nevertheless, Scholem's uses of the terms, and his intentions in doing so, can be more rigorously expressed. Allegory in his sense would act as a signifier that itself becomes effaced in conveying a signified. The signifying energy would be one of transfer, with the sign becoming fully transparent, and in terms of which it would lose its own independent significance. The allegorical signifier would then exist only as a vehicle, in service to a deter minate, prior and controlling meaning it merely signifies. 34 Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), pp. 219-220. For discussions of Scholem's uses of symbol and allegory see Joseph Dan, Gershom Scholem and the Mystical Dimension of History (NY: New York University Press, 1987), p. 157; Paul Mendes-Flohr, "The Spiritual Quest of the Philologist", in idem (ed.), Gershom Scholem: The Man and his Work (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), pp. 1-28, p. 5; MJT 27; 209-212; 214ff; OP 140-142. [181*]</page><page sequence="18">Shira Wolosky [18 This, in fact, casts allegory in the model of traditional notions of the sign, which Scholen! here is trying to reconceive. His theory of the symbol reflects this attempt, pointing toward a different structure of the sign. For the symbol, in contrast, would act as a signifier with an indeterminate, inexpressible, which is to say negative "signified". This indeterminate nature of what is being signified acts to block the transfer of meaning from signifier to "sig nified". The result is to throw significance back onto the signifier, and indeed across all levels of signifiers each of which then carry, or reflect, the surplus of meaning which can never be contained or absorbed by a determinate sig nified.35 The excess of the "signified" throws significance back onto the signifier, which in this sense never loses its own weight of meaning, never grows merely transparent in service of a signified whose achievement of meaning would efface it. The result is a distribution of significance across the full signifying structure, with meaning retained in the signifier (which in this sense becomes also significant) as well as transferring through levels toward an ultimate ground of meaning which remains beyond it, and which always exceeds containment by any signifier. Here the full importance of Scholem's notion of the Nothing comes for ward. It is in fact exactly because, or in that, the Ultimate is beyond expression, called Nothing, that the weight of meaning is thrown back into the series or world of the signifiers. This works, that is, as an inverse negative theology. Instead of all signifiers being consumed in an ultimate ontology whose ultimacy absorbs the significance of each signifier, here signifiers are ulti mately excluded from penetrating their transcendent ground, which remains beyond as Nothing. But this, far from emptying them of meaning, instead fills them with it. The signifiers continue to reverberate with unlimited sig nificance: the hermeneutic multiplicity that characterizes Scholem's Unguis tic world here has its source. The throwing back of significance on the signifier, the surplus or excess of meaning in acts of signifying, infuses the entire process of signification with that "reflection" of meaning across the entire system of language and indeed the entire structure of being that Scholem offers as the core experience of divinity through reality that constitutes mys ticism for him. As he puts it in "Revelation and Tradition as Religious Cat egories", The creative force concentrated in the name of God, which is the es 35 In this regard, Idel's critique that Scholem contradicts himself in claiming that the ultimate Godhead cannot be expressed as contradicted, in that the Sefiroth are expressions, over looks that the Sefiroth are themselves symbols for Scholem, pointing beyond to the in expressible Nothing.

It is never ex hausted by the finite, human word. It represents an absolute which, resting in itself... sends its rays through everything that seeks expres sion and form in all worlds and through all languages (MI 293-294). The multidimensional signifier in fact becomes the fundamental linguistic experience, through all manifestations of the Godhead, whether as creation, as revelation, and indeed within divinity itself when seen as emanated Names. Each letter of language shines with a significance it also reflects, in the universe of multidimensional meaning that constitutes, for Scholem, the my s tical world.36 Here a multidimensional signifying generates substrata of mean ing, which resonate through the (linguistic) world, each component of which is a signifier whose ultimate ground remains inexpressible and unlimited, but whose excess of meaning is distributed across its signifying structures. 5. Critical Metaphysics and the Discourse of Writing In Derrida, the world is conceived not only broadly as linguistic, but more specifically as writing. Meaning is a track of signs in unfolding procession, marking an origin that always remains beyond and outside it. Meaning, that is, is grammatological, a system or process of inscription. "The concept of writing", as he puts it in Of Grammatology, "exceeds and comprehends that of language", with "all language ... a moment, an essential but determined mode, a phenomenon, an aspect, a species of writing" (OG 8). In Derrida, this grammatological model has very specific metaphysical implications, or rather, emerges as a rigorous and wide-ranging metaphysical critique. This Derridean world of inscription, of signifying traces marked by mutual relation, but grounded in negativity, intimately borders Scholem's linguistic world, which likewise carries wide-ranging metaphysical implications. Scholem in startling ways also grants priority to writing, describing the language of creation as inscription, marking, signature. As he writes in "The Name of God": The letter is the element of cosmic writing. In the continuous act of the language of the creation the godhead is the only infinite speaker, 36 Shaul Magid remarks that "language plays an important role in offering an alternative to the centrality of myth of the Hekhalot texts" p. 257. Or, as Harold Bloom remarks of Scholem, "the Sefirot have not interested him greatly" (8). [183*]</page><page sequence="20">Shira Wolosky [20 but at the same time he is the original archetypal writer, who impresses his word deep into his created works (N 168). Linguistic mysticism is at the same time a mysticism of writing. Every act of speaking is, in the world of the spirit, at once an act of writing, and every writing is potential speech... writing for the philologist is no more than a secondary and extremely unmanageable image of real and effective speech; but for the Kabbalist it is the real centre of the mysteries of speech. The phonographic principle of a natural translation from speech into writing and, vice versa, from writing into speech operates in the Kabbala under the conception that the holy letters of the alphabet are themselves those lineaments and signs, which the mod em phonetician would be looking for on his record. The creative word of God is legitimately and distinctly marked precisely in these holy lines (N 167). This system of inscription, which is the created world, emerges as the signs or signatures of God as divine Writer: Letters [are] the secret signs of the divine in all spheres and stages which the process of the creation passes through. The Hebrew word oth means not only letter but also in its precise meaning of the terms, sign, and more specifically mark or signature. The plural othiyoth in dicates the differentiation between the signs of God as miraculous signs, othoth, and the signs of the letters as specific signatures (N 166). The markings of creation as signs are the basis for that multiplication of dimension, that opening of depth, which constitutes for Scholem the mystical, indeed the sacral experience itself: Every thing, beyond its own meaning, has something more, something which is part of that which shines into it or, as if in some devious way, that which has left its mark behind in it, forever (N 165). Why this writing? What is the force of its priority, of its radical imagery of a grammatological world? In Derrida, as also here? In Derrida, the move into writing pursues a more or less clear course. It rejects an ideal realm of Being as immutable intelligibility, acknowledging instead temporal, material, conditions. This displaces the categories of Platonic ontology for the multi plicity, historicity, materiality represented by writing - not as "exterior" to an inferiority or ideality that predetermines it, but as the very realm in which signification unfolds. Therefore Derrida rejects the privileging of the phonetic sound as "the signifying substance given to consciousness, as that which is [184*]</page><page sequence="21">21] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory most intimately tied to the thought of the signified concept" (Pos 22), and compared to which writing is only "a phenomenon of exterior representation, both useless and dangerous" (Pos 25). He proposes instead a new concept of writing [in which] no element can function as a sign without referring to another element which itself is not simply present. This interweaving results in each "element" - phoneme or grapheme - being constituted on the basis of the trace within it of the other elements of the chain or system. This interweaving, this textile, is the text pro duced only in the transformation of another text...There are only, everywhere, differences and traces of traces. The gram, then, is the most general concept of semiology, which thus becomes a grammatology (Pos 26). The model of writing projects our material, temporal world in all its differ entiation, as the site and generation of meanings. Such meanings emerge as interrelationships among components, as "textile" or "text produced in the transformation of another text". Meaning is situated among relations in the concrete world. There is no second (claiming to be first) ontology. Writing thus itself signals Derrida's metaphysical critique, his rejection of an intel ligible realm as the true image that this world merely (and badly) represents. Yet the disappearance of Being does not signal the collapse of meaning. This remains as the "differences and traces of traces" among the components of the immediate world. In Scholem, ontological critique is less rigorous. The move into writing nevertheless follows this critical course, into differentiation and materiality. In Scholem, too, meaning emerges through the interconnections among the component "signs" within a lettristic, written universe:37 Each individual letter in the Kabbala is a world unto itself. In a world such as this the letters, which in other respects are conceived of as forms and mysterious signs, form for their part the substance, which itself always remains the same throughout the movements of the letters which inter-connect with one another. Here the forms are not the mean ings - the letters are thus the substance and form of the intellectual world (N 192). 37 One is reminded here again of Benjamin, whose notion of translation bespeaks a "magic community" in which "every evolved language (with the exception of the word of God) can be considered as a translation of all the others" (Reflections, pp. 325-326); but where "the objectivity of this translation is, however, guaranteed by God" - an urgent question for Scholem. [185*]</page><page sequence="22">Shira Wolosky [22 Letters interconnect in ongoing movements, as substantive elements whose meanings are thus located within concrete creation. Elsewhere Scholem speaks of "texture" or "textus" (N 179,182) as the interwoven letters writing the world as a sign out of its divine source, which, however, remains hidden and inaccessible: The movement in the En-Sof is the original source of all linguistic movement... from this innermost movement the original texture - in Hebrew malbush - is woven in the substance of the En-Sof itself. This is the actual original Torah, in which, in an extremely remarkable way, the writing- the hidden signature of God - precedes the act of speaking. With the result that in the final analysis speech comes into being from the sound evolution of writing, and not vice versa (N 181; Cf. K 132; MI 294). Writing precedes speaking as the hidden signature of God, woven into a texture in ways that resituate traditional ontology. Attention is thrown onto the world as signs, still out of an absolute and ultimate source, yet one that remains impenetrably beyond. The image of writing (and of garment) retains just this exteriority. It particularly realizes Nathan Rotenstreich's analysis of Scholemian symbol as assuming a "fundamental gap between God and.. .any description which can be presented vis-ä-vis the absoluteness of God". In the discourse of writing, the signifier remains irreducibly distinct from its ground and source: as Rotenstreich says of Scholem's symbol, writing acts as "a medium which points to transcendence but remains within its own confines".38 As trace of the transcendent source, the world as writing is ex perienced nevertheless as exterior to and distinct from it. 38 Nathan Rotenstreich, "Symbolism and Transcendence: On Some Philosophical Aspects of Gershom Scholem's Opus", Review of Metaphysics, 31 (1977/8), pp. 604-614, pp. 605,607. The large question of mystical union in Scholem is implied here, as Rotenstreich explicates. Whether or not union exists for Kabbalists, as Moshe Idel has argued, it is a firm commitment of Scholem's that mystical union is not the norm of Kabbalah. As he declares in Kabbalah, "we find no trace of a mystical union between the soul and God. Throughout there remained an almost exaggerated consciousness of God's other ness, nor does the identity and individuality of the mystic become blurred The creator and His creature remain apart, and nowhere is an attempt made to bridge the gulf between them or to blur the distinction" (K 55). Cf. MJT 122-123: "It is only in extremely rare cases that ecstasy signfies actual union with God in which the human individuality aban dons itself to the rapture of complete submersion in the divine stream. Even in this ecstatic frame of mind, the Jewish mystic almost invariably retains a sense of the distance between the creator and his creature". Compare the opening of his essay "On the Pos sibility of Jewish Mysticism": "Jewish mysticism does not exist at all in the sense of [186*]</page><page sequence="23">23] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory Scholem's is in many ways a negative theology; but it is one with a dif ference from traditional Neoplatonist kinds. Here, negation grounds language as an historical and human realm of engagement, rather than acting to absorb it back into an ultimate ontology compared to which it remains itself unreal. As Jacques Derrida in critique of traditional negative theology observes, even "the most negative of negative theologies are always concerned with disen gaging a superessentiality beyond the finite categories of essence and exist ence, that is, of presence, and always hastening to recall that God is refused the predicate of existence, only in order to acknowledge his superior, incon ceivable, and ineffable mode of being (Diff 6).39 Scholem also recalls the hyperousias of Neoplatonism in his discussions of the En-Sof (K 89; cf. Or igins 313). Yet, like Derrida, he pursues the force of negation differently than occurs in traditional negative theology, where the Neoplatonic continuity of being threatens to undermine the very category of transcendence. Scholem in various ways resists subsuming transcendence into ontology as a category of metaphysical being. Scholem's En-Sof as beyond expressibility is not an ontic realm that absorbs, and hence negates, all utterance, emptying it of value as increasingly remote from its ontological source or as unreal or lacking worth in its differentiated, exteriorized, material existence. In his essay on "La Lutte entre le Dieu de Plotin et le Dieu de la Bible dans le Kabbale Ancienne", he warns against the danger that "despite all its negativity, it can too easily be transformed into a positive term" (Lutte 32). Scholem's kabbalistic dialectic breaks into this ontological regime. Thus Scholem con eludes "La Lutte", citing the Zohar: Beyond the [highest] level [of ascent] one can contemplate nothing and know nothing.. .for who can conceive what one would find beyond even thought? ... There is in the En-Sof no graphic sign. No question, no intellectual concept is graspable of him /it.. .because the occult mys tery of thought is not knowable except by way of an emanated light from it to a place where one finds the primordial forms of all the letters (Lutte 52). What can be known are the letters that issue forth, as traces of an absolute direct, unmediated union with the Godhead" (OP 7). Shaul Magid has recently elaborated this resistance of Scholem's to unmediated mystical experience in the contexts of Heideggerian philosophy, as a resistance against pure subjectivism in favor of an objective framework for mysticism: "Gershom Scholem,s Ambivalence", especially pp. 247,251, 268. See Shira Wolosky, "An 'Other' Negative Theology". [187*]</page><page sequence="24">Shira Wolosky [24 origin that remains beyond, impenetrable, unknowable, yet with intimate con nection to the world whose source it is. Across a break between nothingness and being, the divine dialectically emerges into creativity figured as letters, by way of "allusion" to the transcendence which cannot in itself be witnessed or spoken (Lutte 31). This move toward a transcendence outside traditional ontological catego ries represents one response to the Nietzschean critique of metaphysical or ders. On the one hand, it registers modern skepticism regarding worlds of eternal being, either as actual or as helpful toward an understanding of our own historical realities. On the other, it retains transcendence, but no longer in traditional ontological terms. Scholem speaks in this guise of a "whatless" being, of "being without quiddity" (Origins, 286); where "The hidden 'deus absconditus' is not regarded by the Kabbalist as a true subject" (MJT 221). In a very radical departure from traditional ontologies, he questions the fun damental notion of divine impassibility as unchanging Being, venturing in stead toward "giving up the concept of the absolute immutability of God", which "was always an expression of impotence in the face of the infinite variety of God" (JJ 283). Or, as he puts it in his essay on "The Mystical Shape of the Godhead", "God's shape is conceived of, not as a concept or idea, but as names" (MS 28).40 That is, the divine is not represented, but rather designated. As Name, as Scholem suggests in his Ninth Unhistorical Aphorism, the divine "is addressable but not expressible". Beyond depiction, the ultimate, negative Name of God defies representation. As such it acts as reference point for the being of the world, which, however, remains the locus of experience and meaning. In linguistic terms, the absolute as negation founds language, yet remains beyond it, itself ineffable and unnamable. And it is exactly this negativity of ground that causes activity to be centered in the world derived in it: a world that does not directly possess or exhaustively define the absolute, but echoes with it in iridescent reflection. 6. Hermeneutic Risk Scholem's absolute as negation, however, carries enormous risks. As utterly distinct and transcendent, it on the one hand locates linguistic activity and 40 As David Kaufmann observes, Scholem "tries to maintain the transcendent without con ceptualizing it, through the doctrine that God reveals Himself through His ineffable name", p. 154. ScholenVs remarks on divine motion equally point toward a non-ontological transcendence: not only in the kabbalistic creation myths, which depart from Neoplatonism as occurring as a specific event in time, but in other quite radical formulations suggesting both divine mobility and immobility as inapplicable to God. [188*]</page><page sequence="25">25] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory linguistic meaning within the substantive world of creation. On the other, it removes into inaccessibility the ground for this activity. But such inaccessi bility can threaten to leave the linguistic world without anchor: it can in fact be indistinguishable from the negation in which it appears. In Scholem, there is therefore a profound and almost constant pressure toward not only a construction, but also a collapse of meaning. This can be described as a destabilizing of the sign and its structures, in a number of possible directions. First: as in deconstruction itself, there is a threat of the ungrounding of lan guage altogether. The negative theory of representation of the Godhead pen etrates, in Scholem, into all language, to an almost extraordinary degree. There are, for example, Scholem's quite far-reaching remarks in "Reflections on Jewish Theology", where negative theology of an imageless God trans mutes into a negative linguistic theory about all representation whatsoever: The veneration of an imageless God simultaneously casts doubt on the visualizable character that seemed to pertain to everything created. Nothing created was worthy of representing what was beyond visual ization. Therein was also virtually incorporated a possible conclusion which by far transcended the comprehension of the Biblical and Me dieval world. Is not the visualizable aspect of the world mere pretense; is what is visualizable not merely an approximation incapable of ex pressing the Creation? Is not Creation itself in its own way just as much beyond visualization as the Creator? (JJ 280). What seems left are only figures, without anchor, without ground. As Nie tzsche declares in "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense": "What is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, transferred, and adorned".41 Language seems to fall into - or emerge from - its own representations, its own signfiying capacity, without restraint or reg ulation. This indeed seems the threat of contemporary theory, from Nietzsche through Derrida. In Derrida's discussion of "Difference", for example, the negation of the signified takes the aspect of linguistic play without apparent constraint: That there is not a proper essence of difference at this point implies that there is neither a Being nor truth of the play of writing such as it engages difference.... "There is no name for it":... This unnameable 41 "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense", in Friedrich Nietzche on Rhetoric and Language, ed. Sander Gilman et al. (NY: Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 250. [189*]</page><page sequence="26">Shira Wolosky [26 is not an ineffable Being which no name could approach: God for example. This unnameable is the play which makes possible nominal effects, the relatively unitary and atomic structures, the chains of sub stitutions of names in which, for example, the nominal effect difference is itself enmeshed, carried off, reinscribed, just as a false entry or a false exit is still part of the game, a function of the system (Diff 26-27). The "play of writing" seems entirely dissociated from "Being" or "truth", with its "unnameable" ground not to be recuperated into metaphysics as a name for "God for example". Here seems a system of inscription in which "difference is itself enmeshed", but with no anchor and no regulation. Negative transcendence, then, may in effect collapse all ground: negation as tautology, not as paradox. And this lack of anchor can convert the plenitude of multiple interpretations into the nihilism of proliferating claims. The notion of the divine as "meaning-giving but meaningless in itself', as Scholem wrote in his answer to Schoeps; as "apparently meaningless" but which "emanates from words.. .nonetheless charged with meaning" (N192) is one that elevates, in a quite extraordinary way, the hermeneutic process itself. For it is only by way of, or rather as interpretation, that the divine is experienced at all. Yet this is to say that the divine in itself is in fact not experienced. The word of God, itself "absolute", as Scholem writes in "Reflections on Jewish The ology", comes to us only through "many, many mediations": God's creative power is concentrated in the name of God, which is the essential word emanating from God. The aspect of God representing this creative power of His - there may be many other aspects still hidden from us - is imbued with His infinity. He is much greater than any human word, any articulate expression, could comprehend. Only through the medium of infinite refraction can the infinite turn into the finite word, and even then it lends to such a word a depth which goes far beyond anything representing a specific meaning, a communication with other beings. The word of God - if there is such a thing - is an absolute. ... But this also implies that anything which appears to us as the perceptible "Word of God" and in addition contains an intelli gible communication about us and our world, is actually something that has already gone through many, many mediations. The word of God must contain an infinite richness, which is communicated by it. This communication, however- and here lies the core of the kabbalistic conception of Revelation - is unintelligible (JJ 268). It is as "unintelligible" that the infinite Word of God generates an infinitely [190*]</page><page sequence="27">27] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory rich religious experience. Yet this is to say that what it undergoes is "infinite refraction", where hermeneutic activity in a sense eclipses, even as it medi ates, the very source it interprets. What occurs is something like a reversal between interpretation and source; between, as Scholem pursues, Oral and Written Torah. On the one hand, it is the Written Torah that has priority. But on the other, as he writes in his essay on "Revelation and Tradition'1, "What we on earth call the Written Torah has already gone through the medium of the Oral Torah and has taken on a perceptible form in that process". The very writing of the Written Torah, "where signs (the forms of the consonants) or sounds and expressions exist - that sphere itself is already interpretation" (MI 295). The discourse on writing here takes a strange turn. The written in one sense generates the oral, not the oral the written. The grammatological pre cedes the phonic. Yet in another sense there is no clear priority. Both written and oral take shape within the chain of signification. The written is inacces sible except by way of, and actually as experienced within, the 'signifiers' of its oral discussion, whose ongoing chain implicates the written without coming to final closure - a chain of signifiers which is interpretation itself, which the written both shapes and is shaped by; and in which it is at once available and yet also remote. Indeed, even as the signs or inscription of a divine trace, writing remains vulnerable to a removal from the source to which it at the same time attests. The very letters become unstable, unwriting the entire textual basis of understanding. This can occur, as Scholem de scribes, in notions that the text, written in consonants, could have different spacing and distribution; or that the white spaces in the scroll consist of letters which will become legible in a different aeon; that there is even a defective letter or a missing one, whose restoration will alter the way the Torah reads; or that different Torahs pertain to different eras, and will be utterly transformed in a messianic age. All such lettristic approaches to Torah distance it from interpretation of the text as narration, description, informa tion, or command (N 174-175; KS 78-86). Or, in accordance with the mys ticism of divine Names, the Torah text could be regarded, as is hinted even in so authoritative a figure as Nachmanides, as made up entirely of divine names, or even with each letter, atomistically independent, as a name with special meanings or powers (N 77). Or, in a still more daring formulation, the divine is viewed as deus absconditus, unnamed or nameless, beyond even the Torah as names; so that the text fails to reveal the very God it purports to (N 174-175), who is, in one expression, "not even mentioned in the Bible or Talmud" (MJT 12). Such formulas Scholem describes as "audacious and foolhardy" (N 79 KS 40). The link between the hidden God and the manifest [191*]</page><page sequence="28">Shira Wolosky [28 God becomes broken. The surplus of meaning, the multiplicity of interpre tation, becomes destructive of meaning. Here hermeneutic seems to lose its mooring, and interpretation to efface the very object it seems to be serving, overwhelming its referent and dis placing it. "Everything that we perceive in the fixed forms of the Torah, written in ink on parchment, consists, in the last analysis, of interpretations or definitions of what is hidden. There is only an Oral Torah", Scholem writes in "The Meaning of the Torah" (KS 50). Or, in a controversial remark Scholem made in a meeting at Magnes's home: "The Torah is understandable only as the Oral Torah, only from the standpoint of [its] relativization. On its own, it is the 'pristine Torah,' untouched; only through the mediation of the Oral Torah does it become comprehensible".42 The Oral Torah, serving to translate the written into concrete terms, in doing so also blocks access to the Written. The necessary attempt to approach it makes it unapproacha ble.43 This "relativization" of the object threatens to devolve into signification without ground, interpretive anarchism. By place, by time, by person: the refraction which at once brings the Word of God into focus at the same time disperses it into divergent broken light. "The sign of true Revelation", Scholem writes, "is no longer the weight of the statements that attain com munication in it, but the infinite number of interpretations to which it is open". But the implication of this he also calls "as far-reaching as it is dan gerous" (JJ 269). Here the tension between Halachah and mysticism, the normative and the potentially antinomian, becomes explosive. Multiplicity opens to transgression, as the possibility of textual elaboration moves not merely to further understandings and levels of meaning, but to abolishing the text as normatively grasped. Then new interpretations crash against old and mystical insight becomes antagonistic to norms. Hermeneutic multiplicity becomes not augmentation, with rich resonances shared by and enriching different levels of meaning; but rather conflictual, each claim subverting the other. This is especially the case in notions of the interpretative mutability of the letters themselves, a doctrine which "unquestionably", Scholem writes, "left room for all manner of heretical variants and developments. Once it 42 Quoted in David Myers, Re-Inventing the Jewish Past (NY: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 171. 43 Cf. Scholem's difficult Third Unhistorical Aphorism: "The Torah is the medium in which knowledge is reflected: darkened, as the essence of the tradition requires, it radiates into the pure realm of the ,written', which is to say however of unusable teaching." (Biale, Aphorisms, pp. 106-107). [192*]</page><page sequence="29">29] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory was supposed that a revelation of new letters or books could change the whole outward manifestation of the Torah without touching its true essence, almost anything was possible" (KS 82). Yet such risk is potential, if not inherent, in the very notion of hermeneutic which Scholem attributes not only to the mystics, but to the Rabbis in general. This danger is finally not only theoretical but historical. In terms of her meneutic sign-structure, it points in two directions, in each of which the dialectic of interpretation - of sustaining both the hidden and the manifest, negation and revelation, ground and signifiers - comes apart: first, through an attempt at radical fulfillment; and second, through total annulment or abrogation. The first risk has been realized most potently in the Sabbatean movements of apocalyptic messianism. These can be described as a collapse of the distance between sign and transcendence, signifier and source, so as to attempt to possess the absolute itself in the immediacy of history. History itself, that is, would be cast as the realm of the absolute. The distance between sign and ground is overcome, the signifying process collapsed in a bid for full possession of ultimate meaning. In this case, the guard of the inexpressible would be breached. Its inexpressibility, reduced to an expressible, determi nate sense would be invoked and claimed. But then all limits would also be removed. Signifiers would be exchanged for ultimate signifieds, unleashing antinomian claims beyond the constraints of conditional, historical reality. Scholem's own stance regarding such apocalyptic potential seems am biguous. In an interview he claims to "have never stopped believing that the element of destruction, with all the potential nihilism in it, has always been also the basis of positive Utopian hope. Of course, from the standpoint of the values of official traditional Judaism, this conception is negative" (JJ 33).44 44 This question of Scholem־s messianic stances has been much discussed. Moshe Idel argues that Scholem reduces messianism to apocalypse and himself has an apocalyptic imagination, turning on crises, "Subversive Katalysatoren: Gnosis und Messianismus in Gershom Scholem" in Gershom Scholem: Zwischen den Disziplinen, pp. 80-121. Robert Alter sees Scholem's views of messianism as ambivalent, a combination of "fascination and horror" "Scholem und die Moderne", in Gershom Scholem: Zwischen den Disziplinen, 157-175, p. 165. See also Alter's forceful discussion of apocalyptic as against historical messianism, and specifically of Scholem and sabbatianism, in After the Tradition (NY: E.P. Dutton, 1969), pp. 52-53,61-75. Irving Wohlfarth similarly argues that Scholem, like Benjamin, took a position between messianism and anti-messianism, ־'Haarscharf an der Grenze zwischen Religionen und Nihilismus", in Gershom Scholem: Zwischen den Disziplinen, pp. 176-256, p. 194. And although Harold Bloom sees Scholem as gnostic, he also considers him anti-messianic (220). Scholem certainly saw messianic impulses as an integral part of Jewish history, not to be suppressed by pre [193*]</page><page sequence="30">Shira Wolosky [30 Perhaps, as in Nietzsche, he sees destruction as necessarily entailed in constructive energies (Will to Power 351).45 Or Scholem may also long, in some redemptive way, for a final fulfillment of, or new revelation in history. Certainly he denies the effort to bar such antinomian surges from the history of Judaism. Yet Scholem to my mind regards the possibility of false apoca lyptic and its antinomian collapse of morality with alarm. Of the Sabbateans, he writes: "We are dealing with developments within Judaism that show how every acute and radical Messianism that is taken seriously tears open an abyss in which by inner necessity antinomian tendencies and libertine moral conceptions gain strength" (MI 164). Of the contemporary possibility of confusing political Zionism with religious messianism, he writes with dis may: "Action on the political plane of secular history is something different from action on the spiritual-religious plane. It would be disastrous to confuse the two" (JJ 44). Such messianic-apocalyptic collapsing of interpretive distances brings to fulfillment Maimonides's fear, which his negative theology was to guard against: that, in representing God in language, the figures would be mistaken for, and would thus themselves displace divinity. It would involve the mis taking of figure for the divine that it only figuratively represents, as Scholem addresses in his Fourth Unhistorical Aphorism. There he describes the he retical theology of the Sabbatean Kabbalah as mistaking "the materialist lan guage of the Lurianic Kabbala", as if "the symbolism which employs such images and sayings can not also entail something of the thing itself'. conceptions of rational Judaism. And he is fascinated by the dialectical nature of de struction and creativity: where all new creation necessarily involves negation of what has gone before. In JJ: 'Tve defined what I thought was the price the Jewish people has paid for messianism. A very high price. Some people have wrongly taken this to mean that I am an antimessianist. I have a strong inclination toward it, I have not given up on it", p. 26. Steve Aschheim cites the importance of Nietzsche as a "formative figure" for Scholem, who wrote in a letter to Aharon Heller (June 23,1918) that Nietzsche is "the only person in these times to say anything substantial about ethics" and who cites from the Antichrist, writings on Wagner, Untimely Meditations, and Zarathustra (Aschheim, Scholem, Arendt, Klemperer (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001, pp. 14-15). Alter re ports that he received a letter from Scholem denying any influence by Nietzsche and declaring his disdain for him (Zwischen 166). Irving Wohlfarth repeatedly refers to Nie tzsche in his discussion of Scholem, but without specifically addressing Scholem's re lationship to him (Zwischen). See also Biale, Counterhistory, where Scholem is described as being profoundly influenced by Nietzschean "Neo-Romantics" in his early years, but as rejecting Nietzsche's "irrationalism", pp. 36-37.

That is, the dialectic between sign and inexpressible ground would be overcome, in an effort to breach the absolute. But Scholem warns: "There is no immediate undialectic application of the word. If there were, it would be destructive" (MI 296). Or, as he writes in his answer to Schoeps, "The word of God in its absolute symbolic fullness would be destructive if it could also be mean ingful in an immediate (undialectical) way".46 The fulfillment of the sign in this sense would be its destruction. There is, however, a second danger, not of fulfillment, but of annulment. Then figures, signs, would not penetrate and claim the absolute, but rather abolish it. There would be no appeal to any ground beyond historical expe rience itself. The signs of history would become dissociated from any tran scendent ground, in a collapse into pure secularism. Scholem insists on dis tinguishing his position from the secular, from viewing reality only as an immanent series of signs: Entry into history means assimilating into it. [Yet] I do not see ultimate secularism as a possibility for us.. .if the Jews try to explain themselves only in a historical dimension, they will of necessity find themselves thinking about self-liquidation and total destruction. .. .Without God there is no such thing as values or morality that carry any real, binding force.... I do not believe in moral relativism (JJ 34-35). At stake in fact is meaning itself, in this world and in history: something that remains for Scholem a mystery, uncertain, at hazard; but which requires for him - both as structure and as source - a transcendent reference: Any living Judaism, no matter what its concept of God, will have to oppose pure naturalism with a definite no. It will have to insist that the currently so widespread notion of a world that develops out of itself and even is capable of independently producing the phenomenon of meaning - altogether the least comprehensible of all phenomena - can, to be sure, be maintained, but not seriously held. The alternative of the meaninglessness of the world is unquestionably possible if only one also is prepared to accept its consequences (JJ 277-278).47 46 Cf. Kaufman's discussion, p. 154. 47 Cf "Genuine tradition, like everything that is creative, is not the achievement of human productivity alone The tradition is one of the great achievements in which relationship of human life to its foundation is realized" (Ml 303). [195*]</page><page sequence="32">Shira Wolosky [32 7. Sacral Meanings In its most positive version, Scholem's language mysticism opens into a theory of sacral meaning. In its negative version, it points to its own undoing, toward that nihilism on whose edge Scholem described himself as precariously bal anced. Sacral vision sees the world as signs radiant with transcendent meanings, whose experience, however, remains within the realm of signs, facing and infused with, but distinct from, transcendence itself. It sees the universe as linguistic, as sign-system, echoing with further meaning, an excess of sig nificance never finally contained within the sign-system itself, but rather infusing it and opening it to an absolute beyond it. This is fundamental to Scholem's view of text, of world, and history as multidimensional, reverber ating with a surplus of meaning, and to his definition of mystical, even re ligious experience, put in linguistic terms. "It is the transcendence that shines into the created nature and the symbolic relationship between the two", he writes, "that give the world of the Kabbalists its meaning" (K 122). The absolute, itself beyond expression and traditional ontological categories, in fuses creation as language, so that each momentary expression echoes with "infinite meaning". "Even that which has already become a sign in the strict sense, and is already a mediated word, retains the character of the absolute" (MI 295). This splendor also infuses the language humans speak: "The lan guage of God is absolute; it is set forth in its manifestations in all worlds in manifold meanings; and it is from here that the language of men also derives its majesty, even if it is apparently directed at communication" (N 180). As linguistic structure, the sacral is a dialectic that requires both signs and ground, both manifest and hidden, without the sacrifice or final assim ilation of either into the other. This sacral sense of experience Scholem as sociates with Judaism as "recogniz[ing] the existence of a secular sphere to be infused with sanctity". A sanctified world, however, is not the same as a purely secular one. "Sanctification... presupposes a sphere which transcends the immanent values forming themselves in the course of development and necessarily remains relative to the latter" (JJ 290). It is in this world, and of it, but facing a realm beyond - what Paul Mendes Flohr calls Judaism's sacred reality within a sacramental universe.48 Within the terms of such sacral or sanctified experience, the multiplicity of interpretations shifts from schis matic threat to generative participation - a plurality of voices integral to 48 Paul Mendes-Flohr, "The Spiritual Quest of the Philologist", Gershom Scholem, The Man and His Work, ed. Paul Mendes-Flohr (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), p. 4. [196*]</page><page sequence="33">33] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory Schalem's whole vision of history.49 In a sense, the problem opened by mul tiplicity of interpretation is in effect also contained by it. Interpretation is not simply arbitrary or necessarily unbounded.50 On the one hand, its very multiplicity attests to the absolute Word as irreducible to any one expression. On the other, interpretation itself takes place as a chain of discourses, each linked to each in contention, elaboration, complication, augmentation, within the history of engagement with just these signs.51 Scholem calls this chain tradition; its genre is commentary - "the characteristic expression of Jewish thinking" (MI 290), Scholem writes, "the first ranking form of Jewish ere ation" (OP 171).52 In commentary is enacted the dialectic of differentiating signs in multiple dimensions, yet with all facing toward that absolute text that gives each anchor, as each commentator "seeks truth" not simply in trying to find "something new, but to connect himself to the continuity of the tradition of the divine word" (OP 174). "The voice", Scholem writes, "which calls forth incessantly from Sinai receives its human articulation and translation in Tradition, which passes on the inexhaustible word of Revelation at any time and through every 'scholar' who subjects himself to its continuity" (JJ 271). It is textual commitment that binds together this endless endeavor of signs and their meanings. As Paul Mendes-Flohr observes, Scholem's ac count gives "primacy .. .to the hermeneutic moment over the mystical expe rience per se".53 This dialectic, moreover, is at least as historical as it is theoretical or doc trinal. History in Scholem is never an empty dimension, a mere arena in which appear realities determined in some essential, ontological world beyond it, as is the case in Neoplatonism. History for Scholem is not an exterior frame. It is a penetrating condition of any interpretive work. And far from betraying the absolute as its mere relativization, history becomes the very realm in which meaning is realized and comes into fuller being. It is both the realm of divine expression, and the scene of interpretation of the divine Biale discusses Scholem's pluralism in the context of tradition, Counterhistory, p. 131. Harold Bloom goes I think too far when he describes the antinomian potential in Scholem as "pragmatically unbounded", p. 210. This is to underestimate the boundaries of com munal negotiation. Scholem in From Berlin lists this as one of his first attractions to the Talmud, along with honesty, p. 49. Cf. Moshe Idel, "Subversive Katalysatoren: Gnosis und Messianismus in Gershom Scholem Verstand der Jüdischen Mystik" where he writes that Kabbalah, "more than Christian and Moslem mysticism, is marked by a scholastic engagement with sources, via a deeply intertextual type of literature", p. 110. Paul Mendes Flohr, pp. 1-28, p. 12. [197*]</page><page sequence="34">Shira Wolosky [34 word. Interpretation itself is the negotiation of signs under temporal, material, historical conditions, a reading of experience in terms of, and through, the sacred texts. Exegesis in fact has always enacted this link between text and history (KS 33), as undertaken over time, through tradition.54 And such emer gence into historical understanding is the only way the Absolute can be ex perienced at all, not as fallen concession, but as meaningfully realized: Revelation will come to unfold its infinite meaning (which cannot be confined to the unique event of revelation) only in its constant rela tionship to history, the arena in which tradition unfolds. ... Tradition is founded upon the dialectic tension precisely of this paradox: it is precisely the absoluteness that effects the unending reflections in the contingencies of fulfillment (MI 296). Indeed, such interpretive mediation is authorized by the absolute Word itself. Scholem cites a series of legends in which tradition itself tells that God revealed to Moses the Oral as well as the Written law, making interpretation itself a form of Revelation: "Revelation comprises everything that will ever be legitimately offered to interpret its meaning" (MI 289). As in the Talmudic story of the oven of Akhnai, where the consensus of Rabbis override no less than the divine voice itself (MI 291), there is, in Scholem's phrase, an "au thority of commentary over the author" (MI 291). Or, as Scholem writes in his 95 theses to Walter Benjamin: "Das Gesetz der talmudischen Dialektik ist: Die Wahrheit ist eine stetige Funktion der Sprache (Thesis 24)".55 We address ourselves, that is, to the signs we are given, which point to, but never finally define or contain their absolute source. For the Written Torah "as absolute cannot be fully and directly apprehended by the human mind". It can only be known through the Oral Torah which interprets it. It is the Oral Torah that deals with "the modalities of the Torah's application in the earthly world" (KS 68). And this is a mode of "realization, the enactment of the divine task which is set in the revelation" (MI 291).56 Robert Alter describes exegesis as the "characteristically Jewish means to knowledge and perhaps the characteristically Jewish mode of religious experience", Defenses, p. 79. Many commentators emphasize the role of exegesis in linking text to history. Scholem, "95 Thesen Über Judentum und Zionismus", in Gershom Scholem: Zwischen den Disziplinen, Peter Schäfer and Gary Smith, Suhrkamp 1989, pp. 187-295. Cf: "The infinite meaning of Revelation, which cannot be grasped in the one-time im mediacy of its reception, will unfold only in continued relation to time, in the tradition which is the tradition about the word of God and which lies at the root of every religious deed. Tradition renders the word of God applicable in time" (JJ 271). [198*]</page><page sequence="35">35] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory As to the boundaries of interpretation, this too cannot finally be determined through theory. They instead emerge as they are negotiated within the his torical communities in which interpretation is conducted. Scholem regards mysticism not only as private experience but as a public, historical phenom enon, whose "images [are] deeply involved with the historical experience of the Jewish people" (KS 2) and whose practitioners participate "actively in the religious life of a community" (KS 5). Whether or not an interpretation is acceptable depends essentially on whether or not it has been accepted by the community in which it is practiced. Yet Scholem at times seems to envision a harmony of differences. Then the Rabbinic and the mystical, the normative and the supplementary, the exoteric with the esoteric, may be seen to augment or amplify one the other rather than driving to conflicts of mutual subversion.57 Then no one inter pretation would claim fully to embody the absolute, which remains always beyond, but each would offer partial reflection of its splendor. This is a possibility Scholem at least hints at, as when, at the end of "Revelation and Tradition", he evokes a "continuity of voice" that attempts to "unify the exoteric concept of tradition as developed by the T almudists with the mystical concept" of the Kabbalists (MI 268). Each would then express that commit ment to the inexpressible Word whose very differentiation marks its binding nature: Precisely because tradition perceives, receives, and unfolds that which lives in the word, it is the force within which contradictions and tensions are not destructive but rather stimulating and creative (MI 297). Here difference, history, and multiplicity all become positive values. This, again, ties Scholem's work to contemporary thinking, with its assessment of multiplicity and differentiation not as a fall from an ideal unity but as a positive creativity, and which has fundamentally altered traditional ontology. Negation, moreover, is the mark of just this difference, in Scholem as in 57 Stephane Moses seems to see the different interpretive options as more exclusive: "There is a superior form of knowledge which consists in deciphering, under the apparent co herence of communicative discourse, the true sense which is hidden, and which is none other than the logic of names", L'Ange, p. 253. Sigrid Weigel, however, envisages a less exclusive relation, with Benjamin's a division of language as grounded in two spheres: "die Aufteilung der Sprache in zwei Sphären zuggrunde, die Sphäre des 'Offenbarten Aussprechlichen' und die des 'Symbolisierten, Verschweigenen', wobei Scholem davon ausgeht, das die Sprache unendlich sei, insofern sie sich über die beiden Reiche ausdehne". "Scholem's Gedichte und seine Dichtungstheorie", Gershom Scholem: Literatur und Rhetorik, eds. Sigrid Weigel and Stephane Moses, Köln: Bohlau Verlag, 2000, pp. 16-47, p. 29. [199*]</page><page sequence="36">Shira Wolosky [36 Derrida. As in Derrida, negation acts diacritically, as a principle of differ entiation and hence of articulation among the signs of text and of world, sustaining each against dissolution into boundlessness. Negation, that is, emerges both as a generative and as a regulative principle. Not only does it ground all that exists. It penetrates each individual element as a factor of limitation and hence contour and definition. This is an idea to which Scholem repeatedly returns. The creative principle is fundamentally bound up with a principle of negation which acts as transcendent source, but which also substantively informs every act of creation. It thus entails not only generation but also the containment necessary for creativity to occur and its formations to be sustained. Writing on "The Mystical Shape of the God head", Scholem describes this inextricable intermingling of being and noth ing as a mode of construction. "Even this turning toward created beings contains the ineffable that accompanies every expression, enters into it and withdraws from it". There is a "dialectic of manifestation within shape", in which the formless substance of the Ein-Sof is immediately present, in its full reality, in all stages of the process of emanation and creation, in every imaginable shape ... there is no thoroughly shaped image that can completely detach itself from the depths of the formless: this insight is crucial for the metaphysics of the Kabbalah The mystical nihilism that destroys any shape dwells hand in hand with the prudent moder ation struggling to comprehend the shape. ... The divine abyss in its turning toward the outside contains the guarantee of the existence of form (MS 41-42). In the essay on "The Name of God", the activity that issues from divine Nothingness as "the elements of the actual name of God are also the seals which are affixed to the creation and which protect it from breaking asunder" (N 73). As expressed in a Talmudic expression, "The bottomless abyss of all creation is sealed in the name" (N 69), so that the creation which was brought about by "the great and mighty name of God" continues to remain "closely affixed to the Name - i.e. the creation is contained within its limits by the name" (N 69). The essay "La Lutte" concludes with just this dialectic of negation as "an aspect internal to all creation" (Lutte 53), as does the essay on "Schöpfung aus Nichts", where Scholem contrasts the kabbalistic notion of the Nothing against Aristotelian privation. This negation is not lack of form, but is formative, participating in the changingness that is life: "in jedem lebendigen Prozess, bricht das Nichts in dieser Verwandlung mit auf. Es is ein Abgrund, der in jedem Etwas mitgegeben ist... die wahre Wurzel [200*]</page><page sequence="37">37] Gershom Scholen!'s Linguistic Theory allen Seins".58 Or, as he lyrically writes in Major Trends: creation comes continuously out of nothingness, an "abyss which becomes visible in the gaps of existence". "In every transformation of reality, in every change of form,.. .the abyss of nothingness is crossed and for a fleeting mystical moment becomes visible" (MJT 217). This notion of Nothingness as regulative finds ultimate expression in the Lurianic doctrine of divine contraction as an "act of negation and limitation" within the Godhead itself. This marks a clear rupture in Neoplatonic conti nuity, what Scholem himself calls "a thought completely ungraspable for the [earlier] sources" (Lutte 46).59 Scholem had generally distinguished between Neoplatonist and kabbalistic theories of emanation, exactly by placing em anation within the Godhead, thus, on the one hand, distinguishing between world and the ultimate divine principle; while at the same time, however, and against gnostic impulses, retaining a positive manifestation for the God head - the divine as facing, as it were, two ways, one away from the world and one towards it, one hidden and one revealed. The hidden God in the aspect of Ein-Sof and the God manifested in the emanation are one and the same, viewed from two different angles. There is therefore a clear distinction between the stages of emanation in the neoplatonic systems, which are not conceived as processes within the Godhead, and the kabbalistic approach. In Kabbalah, emanation as an intermediate stage between God and creation was reassigned to the Divine, and the problem of the continuation of this process outside the Godhead gave rise to various interpretations.. .[but] all creatures below the Sefirot had an existence of their own outside the Divine, and were distinguished from it in their independent existence since their state was that of created beings, although they had their archetypes in the Sefirot (K 98).60 Divine contraction even more radically stands against the danger of disso lution into undifferentiated unity. "The theory of Tsimtsum also acted as a counterpoise to the pantheism.... Not only is there a residue of divine man ifestation in every being, but under the aspect of Tsimtsum it also acquires a reality of its own which guards it against the danger of dissolution into the non-individual being of the divine 'all in all"' (MJT 262).

Tzimtzum is then contraction, not only as origin but as penetrating model, "auf jeder Stufe ist sie zugleich auch ein immer erneutes, kontinuierliches Sich-Zusammennehmen und Sich-Zurückziehen des Gottes" (S 117). It is "repeated at every stage of creation, therefore pre venting the world from returning to its origins in the infinite" (OP 150). 8. The Gates of Exegesis The Kabbalah as a mystical theology in many ways concerns itself with the divine realm. Yet, in Scholem's account, above and below, divine and worldly, are interconnected, with the mystery of God felt in things of this world and in a sacral history. As he writes in "Tradition and New Creation", "The Kabbalists are essentially interested in showing how the world of the Sefiroth is related to the world outside of God. All being in the lower realm of nature, but also in the upper worlds of the angels and pure forms.. .has in it something, a sefirotic index as it were, which connects it with one of the creative aspects of divine being" (KS 122). This sense of a reality echoing with transcendent meaning is the heart of his linguistic mysticism, with Kabbalah a "philosophy of language" in which the "divine sign is concealed in letters" (OP 2ll).61 Yet this is a formula fraught with ambiguity. The concealment that generates meaning may also defeat it, collapsing into sheer absence only. The line between "religion and nihilism" that Scholem de scribed in his letter to Schocken remains excruciatingly tenuous, and can snap.62 Harold Bloom calls Scholem's a "Gnostic dialectics of negation", a mode of "negative theology" with Scholem himself "the hidden theologian of Jewish Gnosis for our time". And Bloom is surely right that at the core of Scholem's work is the vision of catastrophe.63 The problem of evil, of a world in disorder, whose meaning, if any, seems hidden: this sense haunts Scholem's writing. And he pursues it as the Kabbalists did - through com mentary on commentaries, from text to text, in terms of his own historical This view is reiterated in Alter, where he describes Kabbalah as fundamentally a linguistic mysticism, Defenses, p. 79; and Biale, who calls revelation and tradition linguistic ex periences. Counterhistory, p. 119. As Irving Wohlfarth puts it, this is the "post-Lurianic question", whether the divine light is today hidden or vanished (p. 200). He centers on Lurianic Tzimzum as his focus of discussion, as related to issues of Zionism and exile. Bloom, pp. 216. 214, 207, 217. [202*]</page><page sequence="39">39] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory world - a world, as he repeatedly insists, " in crisis".64 The horrors of our own time, as he writes in the introduction to On the Kabbalah and its Sym holism, have brought us closer to the world of divine negation in Kabbalah: to our "generation that has witnessed a terrible crisis in Jewish history, the ideas of these medieval Jewish esoterics no longer seem so strange" (KS 3). The shadows of our period are such as to attest only a hidden God. We at best hear only "the echo of the vanished word of the creation in the immanence of the world" (N 194). Indeed, it may be that in our times "God [has] con tracted Himself till nothing of Him remained revealed" (JJ 26). God, then, seems to appear, if at all, as a figure of negation - one which could signify a transcendent ground, in ways that withstand modern meta physical critique of ontology (itself a form of crisis of faith); or one which can signify sheer groundlessness. But then, the whole notion of sacral expe rience, of signifying radiance, collapses. And this indeed may be taking place. Scholem repeatedly insists that only acceptance of "the divine character of the Torah as the absolute word [and] an absolute system of reference" makes possible its sacral reflection into "infinite facets, the contingencies of real ization in which the absolute word is mirrored". Only in "the word of God .. .[where] each and every word and letter .. .is an aspect of the revelation of the Divine Presence" can an infinity of interpretation as sacral experience be generated (JJ 270). But modernity has undermined such a notion of the absolute; and history has deeply challenged it. "The binding character of Revelation for the collective", writes Scholem, "has disappeared" (JJ 274). All that remains at best is a "private" symbolism that "does not obligate", as against a vision granting "a symbolic dimension to the whole world" (JJ 48). Language may still carry its sacral history inscribed in its words, but it does so as a repressed, which is to say as an explosive cargo. This is how Scholem describes secularized Hebrew language in his unpublished letter to Franz Rozenzweig: as a volcano whose submerged sacral meanings are ready to explode.65 (Although, as Sigrid Weigel argues, this may be less a criticism of secular uses of Hebrew than of the repression of its religious history and "I had the feeling the Kabbalah had a living center; it expressed itself according to the time, and that in another form it could, perhaps, have said something else in another generation. Something unknown of this sort must have motivated me beyond all the philological games and masquerades at which I excel" (JJ 46). Cf. his suggestion of "a new Jewish translation for our generation"(OP 14-16). Found among Scholem's papers and published by Stephane Moses, "On our Language: A Confession", History and Memory, Vol. 2 no. 2 (Winter 1990), pp. 97-99; republished in OP 27-30.

[203*]</page><page sequence="40">Shira Wolosky [40 meaning.66) Scholem as philologist had always been acutely aware of lan guage itself as an historical power, containing in its very structures and el ements its past usages and meanings (OP 10-12, 22). To reduce Hebrew only to secular uses would be to do violence against its very linguistic fabric. And it would break apart the dialectic of absolute and expression, ground and signifier, hidden and manifest which remains the fundamental structure of Scholem's own linguistic, as well as religious and historical vision. Scholem, writing on Kafka to Walter Benjamin, describes Kafka's as a world in which transcendence is retained only as a kind of empty set - "re duced to the zero of its own content". Here indeed is a "nothingness of rev elation" as a "borderline case" between positive and negative, fullness of interpretation and sheer emptiness.67 For Scholem, Kafka issues a call to interpretation of just this predicament of dearth and fullness. It is a call to each individual to enter the interpretive chain, to read the signs of text and world. Scholem invokes midrashim of such individual call, where the Torah is described as having seventy faces, or 600,000 senses according to the number of the children of Israel present at Sinai (K172). As one commentator explains: "to noone other than he, whose soul springs from thence, will it be given to understand it in this special and individual way that is reserved to him" (KS 63). Or, in Scholem's words, "The gates of exegesis are never closed" (OP 106). Scholem calls this "religious individualism", in which multiplicity, as participation, is contained, even as it is generated, by tradition: Each Jewish soul has its own unique mystical path by which to read Torah.. .this allows a wide latitude for religious individualism, without leaving the fixed framework of the Torah, which reserves to itself the possibility of unique inspiration, which is only granted to a particular individual whose soul is hewn from the same source (OP 15). This is to celebrate multiplicity and difference, indeed to uphold it against a unity which, far from guaranteeing coherence or continuity, instead may threaten or suppress them. Indeed, it is unity, not difference, which threatens a violence of imposition, collapsing interpretative pluralities into dogma. Weigel, p. 37. Correspondence, Sept 30, 1934. Cf. letter of July 9, 1934: "I am still firmly convinced that the theological aspect of [the Trial], in which God does not appear, is the most legitimate of such interpretations". This foray into literary discussion is in fact integral to Scholem's interests. His linguistic theory has broad implications as a theory of poetics, which he throws out as hints repeatedly through his essays. At the conclusion of "The Name of God" he suggests that today only poets may hear the traces of the linguistic resonances he has been describing. See Weigel for a discussion of Scholem's own poetry. [204*]</page><page sequence="41">41] Gershom Scholem's Linguistic Theory This can take secular as well as religious form: it is how Scholem describes fascism itself: "Any value can be distorted - and let us not forget the example of the totalitarian movements. ... When a certain value makes absolute de mands for itself, extending over all and dominating all, only then are the dark and corrupt aspects of this guise revealed" (OP 165). An absolute tran scendence, beyond definitive expression, beyond any single claim to its pos session, guards against just such appropriation. And yet, the removal to dis tance carries its own risk. Scholem's signifying structures are, throughout his work, fragile and unstable. The negative divine may, instead of grounding significant meanings, leave the signs of the world unanchored. The "theoligia negativa" he ascribes to Kafka, wherein Jewish teaching "no longer conveys a positive message, but offers only an absolutely Utopian - and therefore as yet undefinable - promise of a postcontemporary world" (JJ 196) may be a sign of some still unimagined redemption, or an antinomian apocalypse of signs. In Scholem's interpretive vision, "the Torah turns a special face to every single Jew, meant only for him and apprehensible only by him, and that a Jew therefore fulfills his true purpose only when he comes to see this face and is able to incorporate it into the tradition" (MI 297). The multiplicity of signs, grounded in transcendence, then radiates through experience and history, so that "each individual [may] find in the Torah an aspect intended for him alone, and include it in the great tradition. The chain of tradition will not be broken, because it is the translation of the inexhaustible word of God into the human realm" (OP 173). But in Scholem's theory of language, as in Kafka's parable "Before the Law", the doors of interpretation may be closing. [205*</page></plain_text>
