<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Essay "This Space In Between": Barbara Johnson's Dislocations of Feminism and Deconstruction Gyula Somogyi HJEAS With the publication of Défigurations du langage poétique (1979), The Critical Difference (1980), and her translation of Jacques Derrick's Dissemination (1981), Barbara Johnson emerged as one of the most influential deconstructive critics. Yet her second volume of essays, A World of Difference (1987), already wanted "to transfer the analysis of difference . . . out of the realm of linguistic universality or deconstructive allegory and into contexts in which difference is very much at issue in the 'real world'" ( World 2). One of the most important contexts in which Johnson scrutinized this kind of difference was feminism and gender studies, to which she later devoted a whole volume, The Feminist Difference (1998). Most of the readers remember The Critical Difference by the closing article in which Johnson analyzed the debate between Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter." However, to claim that the volume was an example of "purely" deconstructive criticism would not do justice to the amazing complexity of the book. Let me substantiate this claim with some examples taken from this publication. The essay that lent its title to the volume, "The Critical Difference: BartheS/BalZac," selects a case study where Roland Barthes is reading a Balzac short story which Johnson argues is "a subversive and unsettling formulation of the question of sexual difference" ( Critical 5). "Allegory's Trip-Tease: The White Waterlilf also sets out "to analyze and question the very nature of the relations between literature and sexualit/' ( Critical 14). In "Melville's Fist: The Execution of Billy Budd ' we see a superb example of a deconstructive reading which is linked to questions of ethics, law, and judgment. All these examples suggest that from the very start, Johnson's critical approach contained a lot of different discourses which were later fleshed out in full form in various essays and books, including her most recent volume published by Harvard University Press, Persons and Things (2008). Singling out only one problem from Johnson's complex and nuanced approach to (literary, philosophical, or critical) texts might be as dangerous as it is revealing: in this review essay I would like to analyze the relationship between feminism and deconstruction Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies 17.1. 2011.

Jane Marie Todd, one of the reviewers of A World of Difference , concludes her sensitive analysis by pointing out a problem inherent in Johnson's book: "there is a drive to bring feminism around to deconstruction, or to tinker with deconstruction in order to make it more politically acceptable, without a real recognition of the very different stakes of the two critical traditions and the enormous difficulties involved in any confrontation between them" (Todd 284). These concerns arise out of Todd's doubts whether fetishistic notions of deconstruction like undecidability or "self-difference" - which is, as she says, "the value of values" in Johnson's earlier book espousing a "purely" deconstructive approach, The Critical Difference - can provide a solid ground for the advent of an "authentic voice" presupposed by feminist politics and intervention. Similarly to Todd, Chris Weedon also claims that much deconstructive analysis, especially in American literary criticism, fails to attend to questions of social context, particular interest and power. . . . Deconstructionist approaches to textual analysis which share a disregard for the wider historically specific discursive context of reading and writing and the power relations which structure the literary field itself do not meet feminist needs. (Weedon 165) For both critics the most important difference between feminism and deconstruction is their irreconcilable approach to the question of politics. To rephrase Todd's doubts about A World of Difference: can deconstruction with its focus on language and textuality be transformed to adopt a political standpoint necessary for feminism? I think Johnson is acutely aware of the problems Todd pointed out in her review, and she herself addresses this crucial dilemma several times. In The Wake of Deconstruction (1994), she warns us not to miss the double- bind in which deconstruction is caught: Whereas critics in the public media are attacking deconstruction for its subversive politics, politically radical critics of deconstruction within the academy have long attacked it for its quietdstic, apolitical neutrality, its privileging of analysis over action. Because deconstruction involves the analysis of texts or situations to the point of "aporia" or "undecidability," 156</page><page sequence="3">the argument goes, it paralyzes, or at least cannot authorize, action. (Wake 28) In her "Gender Theory and The Yale School," Johnson ponders upon the relationship between feminist issues and deconstruction, which, in her view, "has always been a Male School" {World 32). In this sense, Todd's criticism of deconstruction as unresponsive to questions of gender and sexual difference is justified. Instead of accusing "the male Yale School theorists of having avoided the issue of gender entirely," Johnson in her study chooses "to demonstrate that they have had quite a lot to say about the issue, often without knowing it" ( World 33), arguing that the issue of gender was a blind spot in their writings; it suffices to think about the infamous Archie Bunker example Paul de Man used to point out the ambiguities involved in (rhetorical) questions {Allegories 9-10). But Johnson confesses her own guilt of having elided the question of gender in her earlier writings: "no book produced by the Yale School seems to have excluded women as effectively as T he Critical Difference. ... In a book that announces itself as a study of difference, the place of the woman is constantly being erased" ( World 39). While I do not agree with this view, I think this erasure of woman in her readings of Mallarmé and Apollinaire might be due to the ambiguities caused by the inherently rhetorical nature of language. It seems that deconstructive reading focusing on the rhetorical behavior of texts does have an unconscious tendency to overlook issues of gender. Johnson notes that "the political dimensions of the scholarly study of rhetoric have gone largely unexplored by literary critics. What, indeed, could seem more dry and apolitical than a rhetorical treatise?" ( World 184). In other words, the various kinds of linguistic ambivalences uncovered by rhetorical analyses do not seem to have much to do with political questions and problems, or, in turn, issues of gender or sexual difference. In spite of these observations, however, Johnson argues that "the study of rhetoric has everything to do with human politics" (World 6). In her view, it is precisely the undecidabilities in texts that enable politics to come into existence. "It is often said, in literary theoretical circles, that to focus on undecidability is to be apolitical. ... [1] suspect that, on the contrary, the undecidable is the political. There is politics precisely because there is undecidability" ( World 193-94). Politics is thus not primarily a question of decision-making anymore, as the mere existence of politics flows from the undecidable, which in this interpretation does not hinder, but rather allows, politics to come into existence in the first place. 157</page><page sequence="4">This statement is somewhat odd. How can Johnson posit politics on the basis of undecidability, which is regularly understood as something making it impossible? How can the possibility of politics flow from its very impossibility? Can the discrepancy between feminism and deconstruction be reconciled by this claim? I think that such a "paradoxical alliance" between undecidability and politics, deconstruction and feminism, is generated in Johnson's special way of reading. To see the stake of these questions, we must briefly look into de Man's theories of rhetoric as it is his model of rhetorical reading that Johnson is using (and displacing) in her writings; then we must examine closely the most important ethical/legal/literary figure in Johnson's text, abortion , and point out the ways this figure might help us to rethink the relationship between feminism and deconstruction. In Allegories of Reading we come across a passage which can be connected to this problem: "Far from being a repression of the political, . . . literature is condemned to being the truly political mode of discourse. The relationship of this discourse to political praxis . . . [can be described] in terms of the relationship, within the rhetorical model, between the referential and the figurai semantic fields" ( Allegories 157, emphasis added). Thus, similarly to what Johnson says, in de Man's view, literature, deconstruction, and politics do not exclude each other in any simple way, their relationship (as we might have guessed) is much more complex. If we would like to follow de Man in determining a possible relationship between deconstruction and politics, we must first clarify the relationship between referentiality and figuratdvity within his thinking, as it seems that the relationship between deconstruction and politics is structured around aporetic structures of figurality and referentiality. Language in de Man's view is always figurative, rhetorical, which is at odds with the texts' claims to reference to something beyond them. Direct political action and intervention (the instrument feminism) requires precisely this kind of reference, whereas deconstruction, with its problematization of reference and figurality (through the question of rhetoric), seems to exclude straightforward politics. As Werner Hamacher claims, "the referential intention of a text can be denied by the indication of the possibility of its merely figurative status" (Hamacher 173). In this sense, if political praxis has to be connected with transparent, referential language, it cannot but fail to be "political enough" because of the (inescapably figurative) language it has to use to formulate its claims. In a rhetorical reading, the language of politics becomes opaque, its authority subverted by 158</page><page sequence="5">the very means which was used to posit it. In order to be effective, political praxis has to forget about its necessary figurai status. The most important problem we have to face here is that de Man argues that "the convergence of the referential and the figurai signification can never be established" ( Allegories 208). This suggests that politics and rhetorical inquiry, feminism and deconstruction, may never simply converge. Yet there seems to be a need for such a convergence, as texts often try to reconcile these two dimensions: de Man says that the "attraction of reconciliation [in this case, of figurality and referentiality] is the elective breeding-ground of false models and metaphors" ( Allegories 5), or, in other words, ideologies. In the light of these de Man quotes, how are we to judge Johnson's intention of "reconciling" rhetoric and politics, deconstruction and feminism? Does it (falsely) promise the convergence of figurai and referential signification, which, according to de Man, cannot be established? Is this promise only a metaphor, a "false model," an "aberration" even, or a way through which Johnson can work out possibilities left unexplored in de Man's writing? Let me quote Johnson again as she states that the essays collected in A World of Difference attempt "to transfer the analysis of difference . . . out of the realm of linguistic universality or deconstructive allegory and into contexts in which difference is very much at issue in the 'real world'" ( World 2). Johnson also warns us that "[i]t would be falsely progressivist, however, to see in these essays an itinerary that could be labeled 'From Deconstruction to Feminism'. . . . The book as a whole moves back and forth among positions that remain skeptical of each other" ( World 4). It would thus be a mistake to think about A World of Difference as a text where deconstruction is left behind for the sake of feminist inquiry: the author's texts show that the (falsely reductive) opposition between deconstruction and feminism can be realigned in the process of reading literature, which entails not only an inquiry into rhetoric, but also an engagement with politics. As Johnson writes in The Feminist Difference, "literature is important for feminism [as well as for deconstruction] because literature can best be understood as the place where impasses can be kept and opened for examination, where questions can be guarded and not forced into a premature validation of the available paradigms" {Feminist 13). In an interview, Johnson explains how this transfer from linguistic structures to the real world might take place: by saying that 159</page><page sequence="6">. . . certain political problems are based on rhetorical structures or are thoroughly shaped and overdetermined by rhetorical structures. In the case of the essay I wrote, "Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion," it seemed as if apostrophe and the attendant personification were inseparable from the way in which "person" was discussed in legal texts and the way in which the investment in the unborn was structured like apostrophe. (Wake 81-82) This "turning to the real world," then, is not that straightforward: in the essay referred to in the interview, "Apostrophe, Animation and Abortion," Johnson is trying to illuminate a problem in the real world (for example, a political or a legal problem, like abortion) with rhetorical issues, and vice versa, showing that - as Harold Schweizer says - "aesthetic and textual concerns are then perhaps in surprising ways applicable to the political situation" ( Wake 82). There is a certain parallel between what Diane Elam is arguing in her theoretical treatise on the relationship of feminism and deconstruction and what Johnson is trying to do with more practical criticism. Elam's theoretical inquiry offers an ethical "way out" of the impasse generated by the debate of the theoreticians of the two fields (Elam 87), while Johnson's choice of subjects reflects a similar way of thinking: for example, in "Apostrophe, Animation and Abortion," she chooses a subject or a figure which seems to hold the promise of establishing what de Man called "the convergence of referential and figurai signification," politics and rhetoric, and at the same time, with which she can rethink the reductive view of the relationship between feminism and deconstruction. This subject, which is deeply ethical in its nature, is the problem of abortion , the meaning of which is negotiated (and at the same time, resisted) between the discourses of law and literature (more precisely, lyric in this case). Barbara Brook emphatically calls our attention to the fact that "pregnancy is one of the areas where modern state seems to have very little problem in deciding the personal is political, not in the way feminism required, but by erasing women's pregnant bodies and focusing on the foetus" (Brook 95). In other words, the neat boundaries between the private (to which women were traditionally referred) and the public seem to break down by the reference to the figure of the pregnant body. However, this breaking down of boundaries does not mean for women an advent of voice; quite the opposite: the personal (the experience of pregnancy) becomes political only through erasing the agency of women. The female body is 160</page><page sequence="7">appropriateci by power and becomes a public "instrument," no longer fully available to women's choice (either of abortion or of giving birth). In Elisabeth Porter's view, "One of the most vexing issues in ethics is that of abortion" (Porter 134). She suggests that the "impasse that occurs when we discuss the 'rights' of a woman to choose whether or not to terminate the pregnancy and the 'rights' of the foetus to life appear insurmountable" (Porter 135). It is this ethical aporia that law and literature must address. To realign a bit Zillah Eisenstein's phrase, it is "in this space in between" law and literature that the meaning of abortion can be communicated (qtd. in Porter 139), but continues to elude us: "Competing rights are opposed, causing an irresolvable moral-legal dilemma" (Porter 139). This problem is clearly indicated by Adrienne Rich, who claims that "[t]he child that I carry for nine months can be defined neither as me or as not-me" (qtd. in MacKinnon 363 nl5), suggesting that in the experience of pregnancy, there can be no easy and clear-cut differentiation between mother and child, self and other. It is precisely through a "cut," the cutting of the umbilical cord, that the difference between mother and infant is finally stabilized. It is this intertwined nature of self and other, mother and infant that both "Pro-choice" and "Pro-life" arguments miss. Jurisprudence is usually the instrument called upon to resolve these kinds of aporias, "to arbitrate between opposing views" (Juridical 4), even though its decision cannot but be arbitrary in this case. In her book entitled The Juridical Unconscious , Shoshana Felman claims that a "trial is presumed to be a search for truth, but, technically, it is a search for a decision, and thus, in essence, it seeks not simply truth, but a finality: a force of resolution" (55). It either chooses to respect women's right to privacy (as in the legal case Rae v. Wade), or decides to give primacy to the right of the foetus to life. In either case, it inevitably misses something: as Carol Gilligan claims, pregnancy implies a connection between the mother and the foetus "in which there is no way of acting without consequence to other and self' (qtd. in Porter 152). Both solutions imply some kind of violence, thus law cannot but partake of the violence it was called upon to adjudicate. As opposed to the language of law, literature is "a dimension of concrete embodiment and a language of infinitude that . . . encapsulates not closure but precisely what in a given legal case refuses to be closed and cannot be closed" (Juridical 8). Literature is thus about what a legal case must inevitably miss by reducing the undecidability concerning abortion to a decision. It is this aspect of literature that Johnson's article explores in her 161</page><page sequence="8">analysis of the shifting and often ambivalent structures of address in women's poems about abortion. In "Apostrophe, Animation and Abortion," Johnson shows how rhetorical and political structures are mutually implicated in each other. She asks whether "the very essence of [a legal or] a political issue . . . [might] hinge on the structure of a figure" {World 184). In her view, the various legal debates surrounding abortion seem to revolve around the central question of "when, precisely, a being assumes a human form" ( World 189). Johnson suggests thât these debates seem to hinge on the structure of apostrophe, which is precisely about giving (figurai) life, animation and presence, to something dead, inanimate, or absent. She elsewhere describes the discourses of lyric and law as "two very different ways of instating what a 'person' is" ( Persons 188). While deconstruction's insistence on the ambivalences and undecidabilities uncovered in texts through rhetorical readings runs the risk of effacing question of gender and sexual difference, feminism, through its demand of political action presupposing strong subject positions, runs the risk of reducing self-difference and ambivalence. Through the figure of abortion (the meaning of which is negotiated between law and literature), Johnson is able to work out a dialogue between deconstruction and feminism, in spite of their considerable differences. On the one hand, abortion is shown to have its unique kind of undecidabilities and ambivalences, which make it resistant to univocal feminist appropriation. On the other hand, the familiarity of "linguistic universality or deconstructive allegory" ( World 2) found in de Man's view of language and rhetoric is inflected with and, at the same time, displaced by the focus on the politics of gender and sexual difference. In Johnson's critical praxis, feminism and deconstruction are "intertwined" ( Wake 96): they exist in a relationship of mutual implication; as Felman put it elsewhere, "each one finding itself enlightened, informed, but also affected, displaced by the other" ("To Open" 9), or, in Johnson's words, "haunted by the ghost of the other" ( World 44). Although introducing a psychoanalytic metaphor into my text might result in more problems than it can shed light upon, I risk calling - as Felman does, following the insights of Lacan - this relationship between feminism and deconstruction the relationship between the conscious and the unconscious. They are each other's condition of possibility and at the same time both function as the element which threatens to disrupt the other's authority, which relationship is, in Lacan's view, the ethical relation par excellence . Johnson's texts suggest that we should 162</page><page sequence="9">"recognize these ghosts not as external enemies but as the uncanny familiar strangers that make their own knowledge both possible and problematic" (World 46). Twenty years after publishing "Apostrophe, Animation and Abortion," Johnson's most recent book - and unfortunately her last one, as she died on 27 August 2009 - Persons and Things, redirects our attention to the "difficulties of establishing proper definitions of 'person' and 'thing'" (2). She opens up various contexts in which the boundaries between persons and things are contested and confused, pointing out that the concepts are hard to define properly within the confines of language as langue itself seems to be a perpetrator of these confusions. It is the very same confusion of machines with living persons (namely Olympia in E.T.A. Hoffman's "The Sandman") that prompted, among other things, Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytical concept of the uncanny, and the problem also appears in Descartes's meditations (51). "Toys R Us: Legal Persons, Personal Pronouns, Definitions" introduces the contexts in which the readings are staged; Johnson calls them the "reality of desire," "the reality of materiality," and the "reality of rhetoric" (3). The author explains that she is using different theoretical backgrounds which are not necessarily compatible as every point of view ignores something that another might reveal. Psychoanalysis, Marxism and rhetorical deconstruction come to mind at once from the three aspects pointed out above. We know from Johnson's earlier writings that she is also very aware of the gender and racial implications of her theme as well, which gives the volume a considerable critical potential. All of these critical contexts and methods are interwoven in Persons and Things, creating a highly complex yet very illuminating argumentation. From a rhetorical aspect, the most important figures of speech revolving around the difference (and the confusion) between persons and things in Johnson's reading are apostrophe, prosopopeia, and anthropomorphism. The animating address of apostrophe, which constitutes poetic voice itself, is "making a relation between persons out of [what] was in fact a relation between persons and non-persons" (9). Prosopopeia , where "voice assumes mouth, eye, and finally face" (12), becomes a trope of reading poetry as the intelligibility of lyric depends "on the creation of a poetic voice" (14). Anthropomorphism, "having human-like character or form" (15), seems to be a function residing in language itself "as an unconscious constraint on imagination" (15) which is very hard to resist: Johnson's analyses of poems by Wisława Szymborska (17), Marianne Moore (29), and 163</page><page sequence="10">Francis Ponge (32) aptly demonstrate this. The history of poetry seems quite aware of its reliance on figures conferring personhood and there have been many experiments to change this: it is enough to think of imagism or objective poetry to see that poetry always sought to find new ways of expression in "taking the side of things," as Francis Ponge would have it ( Persons 33). Johnson later in the book also traces a similar "capacity to capture the pathos of the object . . . without overt personification" (100) in D. W. Winnicott's notion of transitional objects. The notion of the voice returns in Johnson's reading of commodity fetishism, too, which transfers "humanness from the maker to the product" (20). Products are frequently packaged to address the buyer, to convince them: "if the purchaser responds to the speech of the object, he or she feels uninfluenced by human manipulation ... as though the relation between buyer and commodity were the entrance to a relationship" (19). Yet this animation also presupposes its inverse, the reification of the producing force, locating "human beings in the realm of the inhuman" (21), which has both gender and racial implications. She also recognizes that this reification or alienation "does not offer itself in the form of a figure" (23), and this might be because language inherendy tries to defy "a decline of humanness and a thingification that go on all the time and have only accelerated with commodity capitalism" (23). It would be a mistake to think that these tropes and figures of speech are absent from critical discourse; they pervade any kinds of rhetoric: they are there in Johnson's own text as well as within this review essay. Moving from "Things" and "The Thingliness of Persons" to "The Personhood of Thing" and finally to "Persons," the trajectory of the book seems to rely on the rhetorical figure of chiasmus , which involves a symmetrical inversion of two qualities. Reading the whole book gives the impression, however, that the connection of persons and things is anything but symmetrical even though their relationship has very frequendy been structured by the figure of reciprocity in literature and philosophy. Does this mean that Johnson remains a prisoner of her own rhetoric, like Marx denouncing the fetishism of commodity through anthropomorphism that he condemned as an aberrant figure? It may be, though it is very hard to avoid making such repetitions, which also appear in de Man's texts, where rhetoric as such or rhetorical figures gain animation through language, which runs parallel to how writers or thinkers seem to lose control over their texts. 164</page><page sequence="11">"Monuments" collects different contexts that all contribute to the interpretation of the word: locuses of collective memory, tombstones, writing, and memorializing. Johnson concludes that "[a] monument ... is supposed to confer on a memory the immortality that only inanimate things can possess" (39). She devotes much time to meticulously trace the gendered/ maternal aspect of monuments as well, like in Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People , or in the Statue of Liberty, or in Plath's poetry: "to both sexes, the monument offers the satisfactions of regression: the fetus inside the mother can scale her insides with the skill and consciousness of someone who has already been born" (43). Through reading Ovid's story of Narcissus, Descartes's meditations, ego-psychology, and Jacques Lacan's inauguration of the mirror stage, "Ego Sum Game" contests the general assumption that "the human 'self is a person, not a thing" (48). For Lacan, the mirror image is "[a]n idealization. A fiction. An object," and the subject comes into existence in the "noncoincidence, this split between an 'armor of alienating identit/ from the mirror image and a 'corps morcelé' that is 'animated' by a trembling reality" (57). Becoming human thus necessarily involves a moment of "becoming a statue" (57), identifying with a form that is superior to the onlooker: "the subject comes into being in the gap of inferiority between a flawed viewer and the anticipated wholeness of an armor of fiction, an armor of inanimateness" (59). Moreover, we also learn that "the ideal self pursued by the subject is aesthetic1' (121). "They Urn It" asks the question "What is a thing?" (61) and takes a look at different answers, including Heidegger's philosophy, Wallace Stevens's "Anecdote of the Jar," Ovid's tales of Apollo and Daphne, as well as the poetry of Ann Petty, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton. "The aesthetic object is cut off and detached from the ongoing flow of life. . . . The proximity of the beautiful to annulled reproduction, and hence, to death is perhaps a large part of its expressiveness" (65-66), hinting at a hidden link between aesthetics and violence that is quite prevalent in literature, which usually genders urns and containers as female (71-72). Becoming a thing is offered as a way of escape, but it is a dubious solution at best, as it utterly denies subjectivity and agency, but, on the other hand, this loss of voice and animation, through the male lover's laments, brings lyric as such into being (78). Lyric is formed out of loss, but only through sacrificing the female, turning her into a thing, which later can be apostrophized and addressed. First, she is killed off, then symbolically brought back to life by the male persona through language and rhetoric, but this time lacking any kind of 165</page><page sequence="12">agency. By forming a victory from a loss, sexual difference is erased (77), but what happens when women writers try to recover the agency that was taken from them? Indeed, the most fascinating moments in Johnson's readings occur where the author is broadening the scope of (male) discourse to see how women writers subvert our inherited notions of sexual difference. "Puppets and Prostheses" also examines the relationship between violence (actual or metaphorical) and aesthetics: "cutting off limbs and replacing them with prostheses may seem gruesome, the idea of a dimension that human beings cannot reach is actually a rather common form of aesthetic idealization" (83). Heinrich von Kleisťs "Über das Marionettentheater" idealizes puppets by saying that they have much more grace than human bodies can ever have due to their being perfect mechanisms (87). Johnson contrasts this aesthetic idealization of prostheses to their literal, very real appearance in people's lives. David Wills's book Prosthesis points out how artificial limbs function in a similar way to Derrida's logic of the "supplement": the wholeness of the body and "organic form might always have been a fantasy" (89), and the limbs just bring this insight to the surface. Perhaps the most evoking part of this chapter is the ending, suggesting three very different yet "paradigmatic" cases of prostheses: Freud's artificial mouth implant, Captain Ahab from Melville's Moby Dick, Wegg from Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, though the text does not elaborate these parallels in too much detail. "Using People: Kant with Winnicott" sets out from a notion that using and objectifying other people to reach our own goal is anything but ethical. Turning this notion around, Johnson asks, "what if the capacity to become a subject were something that could best be learned from an object" (95)? In the author's view, Winnicott's theory of transitional objects "cannot be understood in terms of a dichotomy between subject and object, since it helps bring that dichotomy into being" (98), and the rhetorical persuasion of Winnicott's theory surprisingly resonates with Kant's formulation of moral law and duty "because in neither case is it possible to say whether the object is inside or outside the subject" (103). This very important dichotomy - and thus culture as a whole with it (105) - arises from the object surviving destruction by the subject after which the object can be addressed as loved: "The structure of address animates the object as a 'you,' a destroyed 'you,' a loved because destroyed 'you'" (103), not much unlike what happens to women in poetry (95). 166</page><page sequence="13">"Romancing the Stone" picks up where "Puppets and Prostheses" left off. In an in-depth analysis of Parnassian poetry, Johnson notes how they created a "cult of form" (116) which was best exemplified in poems addressing statues (117), and the analysis of whiteness calls our attention not only to the gender, but the racial aspects of the issue at hand (119). The notion of preferring statues to real-life women is thematized in the stories Johnson is reading, Henry James's "The Last of the Valerii," Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun , and Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's L'Eve future. "In all of these romances of stone, attraction to a statue combines with a high degree of violence: severed hands, sacrifices, shipwrecks, . . . murder, suggest that love affairs with statues can be hazardous to one's health" (129). To emphasize the "violent transition between person and thing," Johnson reads a film, Boxing Helena (1993), which hauntingly demonstrates "what is at stake in the relations between violence and the statue" (129): the film "literalizes something about the aesthetic process. It is a process that detaches its object from life,' places it in a frame, box, or on a pedestal, and attributes to it a form of autonomy or self-standingness that is actually a form of absolute dependency" (130). "Surmounted Beliefs" examines the notion of fetishism as it appears in the works of Freud, Marx, and Benjamin. For Marx the fetishism of the commodity means a double delusion: the human labor behind the commodity vanishes, and commodities are invested with an animation of their own. This logic involves "an illegitimate exchange of properties: the necessary human acts are invisible, and the commodities seems to have a life of their own. Persons are thus robbed of volition, which is given to things instead" (140, compare 142), yet he can only condemn this fetishism by personifying commodities themselves, making them "the spokesthings for the delusions of volition he is denouncing" (140). On the other hand, for Freud the fetish is invested with desire: it stems from "a traumatic scene: the boy's discovery of sexual difference" (143). Upon perceiving the mother's lack, desire fixates metonymically on something else to retain the imaginary "wholeness" that was attributed to the mother before the scene (143). Supplementing a "missing" part, the fetish works very much like a prosthesis (146), yet it is also connected to language, as Freud's prime example of the fetish is linguistic (143). For Benjamin, capitalism involves both senses of the fetish, channeling "the easily excited desire toward commodities" (147). In a way, what Marx condemns as an aberration at second glance might as well be "the secret of commercial success" (168). 167</page><page sequence="14">"Artificial Life" concentrates on instances where the boundaries between machines and humans are blurred. As technology is advancing, telling the two apart is becoming an object of anxiety: being mortal, producing art, having emotions are what traditionally thought to differentiate humans from machines. Yet, according to Sherry Turkle, the "traditional distinctions between the natural and artificial, the real and the simulated, might dissolve" (157). In her nuanced reading of various toys, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Blade Runner, Johnson shows that "the idea of artificial life does not function as the key to difference but makes the mystifications of vitalism more apparent" (162). After having examined from different angles how certain men in literature seem to prefer "inert but beautiful [women], in which male narcissism finds no other will to hamper [them]" (164), in "Real Dolls" Johnson turns to analyze the Barbie doll, which "for many, perniciously keeps the dream of idealized and inert femininity alive in the United States" (165). Barbie "was made not as a baby but as a woman; not as someone to cuddle and shape but as someone to emulate" (165). Throughout the years, the doll became a simulacrum that is still shaping the way girls and women think about their bodies, evoking many questions about femininity, ethnicity, race and class. "Animation" notes the fascination with animation in Disney movies, Japanese animes, Pixar's Toy S toņi, then goes on to examine fantasies of animating dead or inanimate things in Villiers de L'Isle-Adam's novel and Shelley's Frankenstein. Shelley's novel serves as an illustration of the darker underside of animation: Frankenstein's deed did not lead to "his own aggrandizement": "what he saw in that watery eye [of his creature] was an 'other' who made demands on him. His object was suddenly a subject, able to make his maker into an object" (175). The double epigraph of Persons and Things also refers to this opposition: Galathea animating under Pygmalion's shaping hands in Ovid's story is a joyful moment, a dream, yet someone losing animation, as if turning into stone is rather like a nightmare. Beginning with Roland Barthes's amorous investment in Greta Garbo's face, "Face Value" states that "people are fascinated by the human face" (180), and the chapter goes on to enumerate on various contexts of the theoretical and philosophical implications of faces: it is "a sign of someone's uniqueness" (180), yet the identity that the face presupposes can only come to existence with reference to an image (an object) which is then later assumed as one's own (181). With modern plastic surgery faces can even be altered now; however, these cosmetic surgeries usually follow an 168</page><page sequence="15">ideal which is racially coded: "The most common 'aesthetic' surgery, rhinoplasty, reduces the size of a prominent nose, often to create the thinner, turned-up nose said to be more in keeping with white standards" (185). For Johnson, Botox treatments can restore or preserve youth only by temporarily making "the living body into a statue, but unfortunately life, with all its imperfections, comes back" (185). As she writes in the "Epilogue," "The kind of stasis that only a thing can have becomes a perfection the human being will never achieve - life itself becomes a flaw the human being strives to deny" (231). It is in this chapter that Johnson also elaborates on her childhood anxiety mentioned in the introduction, that she could not eat anything that had a face and could see (her "prosoponophobia" 182). Whereas de Man's "Autobiography as De-Facement" conflates masks with faces, Cecil Penada's Face cannot accept "a mask as a substitute for a face" (183). "Without a face, Helio"- - the protagonist of the novel whose face was terribly disfigured in an accident - "can neither be a topic nor an addressee of language" (184), only the sufferer of verbal or actual violence. Somehow violence is a recurring motif here as Johnson notes that "[t]he words in other languages that mean 'face' add tö the repertoire of uncanny violence" (181), which rhymes with Emmanuel Levinas's assertion of the living face as the "ethical claims of the human Other": "The face is exposed, menaced, as if inviting us to an act of violence. At the same time, the face is what forbids us to kill" (187). For Lévinas, ethics comes from the face of the other, whereas for Lacan, it comes from the Thing (das Dinģ), which Johnson in "Lost Cause" associates with the objet a, the object cause of desire. "It is searched for as cause of desire but does not exist except in the unconscious of the subject . . . [it] is presumed to have existed because of the feeling that something has been lost. It can be refound, but was never present" (211). And "the need to find a substitute for that first, forbidden, Oedipal object is, according to Lacan (after Lévi-Strauss), necessary for there to be language and culture at all" (218). Prohibition, the Law, creates desire (214), and Johnson shows that this Law is very much like performative language: "Instead of referring to the world, performative language acts in the world. It creates, ex nihilo, things that would not exist without the rules of language" (216). Yet, as Johnson notes, conferring animation (apostrophe) and its opposite, violence or murder, is often eclipsed in crucial scenes of narratives (for example, Frankenstein and The Marble Faun). 169</page><page sequence="16">Undoubtedly one of the most revealing parts of the book is "Anthropomorphism in Lyric and Law," which tide consciously evokes de Man's famous essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric." In the author's view, the recent (the original essay dates to 1998) discussions of law and literature "tended to focus on prose - novels, short stories, autobiographies, even plays - rather than lyric poetry" (188). For Johnson, "lyric and law might be seen as two very different ways of instating what a 'person' is" (188), evoking a problem similar to what she was preoccupied with in her "Apostrophe, Animation and Abortion." The texts being read in the essay, Baudelaire's poems and a Supreme Court case, suggest that "Ambivalences about personification, especially the personification of abstractions . . . permeated not only legal but also literary history" (206). Johnson discusses in detail the de Man essay alluded to in the title, and poses the lesson of the reading in a (rhetorical) question: "Does lyric poetry try to give a psychological gloss to disruptions that are purely grammatical?" (195), referring to de Man's reading of the word comme in Baudelaire's "Correspondences," which word can suggest both "metaphorical similarities among the senses pointfing] to a higher spiritual unity" and a "sheer enumeration [which] would disrupt that claim" (194). Such a reading would deny the claims of anthropomorphism over personification and open up the text to the random interplay of language, denying any subjectivity and consciousness to come into existence. Johnson claims that "anthropomorphism depend [s] on the givenness of the essence of the human while personification does not," and we can never safely tell them apart, which leads to an anxiety over humanness and personhood as such. We might think that law should help us when we are trying to find a definitive answer to the relationship between persons and things, but Johnson's examples show that American legal history has twists of its own: pressing ambivalences reside in the Reconstruction Act (the act giving full citizenship - personhood - to slaves), the Dictionary Act (extending personhood to corporations), or in test cases like Roe v . Wade (ruling when the fetus becomes a person). This essay analyzes Rowland v. California Men's Colony which case for Johnson is about "what a person is, and how you can tell the difference between a natural person and an artificial person" (198). The judges in charge are not in an easy situation as "the task of reading becomes an infinite regress of glossing terms that are themselves supposed to be determinants of meaning," and to refuse the claim of the prisoners to be able to sue in forma pauperis (to deny their natural personhood as they are 170</page><page sequence="17">to be considered artificial persons), Justice Souter has to refer to an anthropomorphism (of the Congress) to put an end to this infinite regress of language (199). Johnson felt that the real stakes of Persons and Things ultimately lies in the "difficulty in being sure that we treat persons as persons" (2), pointing to an ethical imperative behind the whole research into the theme. Yet the epilogue admits, "This book offers no help in treating persons as persons, but it does explore the richness of a human being's relation to things" (232). The book need not admit defeat, however, as it does "shed light on the 'human' - even where there is nothing where the 'thing' is presumed to be" (232). When I started writing this review essay I was not aware that I was writing a sort of epitaph. No doubt, my text is also complicit in using the rhetorical figures that the author is analyzing in her final book. To obey the rules of effective argument I frequendy personified the chapters of Persons and Things and effaced their author; I also substituted my own voice for the silent letters of the original, which proved most fascinatingly responsive. Sadly, we can no longer rely on Barbara Johnson's own voice to guide us, so I would urge everyone to read anew her unique contributions to literary criticism and philosophy: as she writes, "The superiority of writing as a monument lies in the fact that its materiality is not subject to the ravages of time. ... It is an accident of history if monuments survive . . . but writing transcends its material base" (Persons 37).
