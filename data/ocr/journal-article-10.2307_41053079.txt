Kohler1 Recent developments in the study of the prehistory of the northern Mogollón and Anasazi areas of the North American Southwest are reviewed, with emphasis on thepre-AD. 1150 period, in an attempt to identify key empirical results and incipient interpretive directions. KEY WORDS: southwestern archaeology; Anasazi; Mogollón; complex adaptive systems. INTRODUCTION This article is intended for those who have some passing familiarity with the prehistory of the northern American Southwest but who, inex- plicably, have not read anything emanating from this area since about 1988. What has changed? What then-nascent trends have become well-es- tablished research directions? What new empirical findings have come to light that might significantly constrain our interpretations of the local pre- historic record? And what old, almost-dishonored areas of inquiry have been rehabilitated by changing theoretical perspectives and research op- portunities? These questions are approached here with an emphasis on prehis- toric societies in what becomes, after about A.D. 500, the Anasazi and northern Mogollón area. I cite as much relevant literature as possible to provide entries into this vast but fragmented body of information and in- terpretation. The recent publication of several extensive symposium vol- umes treating this area - including those of Cordell and Gumerman department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-4910, and Santa Fe Institute, 1660 Old Pecos Trail, Suite A, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87505. 267 1Q59-0161/93/1200-0267S07.0Q/0 O 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">268 Kohler (1989), Crown and Judge (1991a), Gumerman (1988), Lipe and Hegmon (1989a), Minnis and Redman (1990), and Spielmann (1991)- has compli- cated my task, but should help the inquiring reader enormously. Given the emphasis in most of these volumes on the late prehistoric period, I have chosen to emphasize the state of research in the pre-A.D. 1150 pe- riod. The varied literature using the high-resolution contexts of the South- west primarily to build middle-range theory (e.g., Kent, 1992b; Schlanger, 1991) has been largely ignored. Alan Simmons and others (1989) provide a lengthy overview of the pre-1988 literature for the New Mexican portions of this area, plus Trans-Pecos West Texas and the mountains of south- central Colorado. BACKGROUND: THE GREAT DEBATE OF THE 1980s The article that thematically opened the decade of the 1980s for southwestern archaeology was Cordell and Plog's (1979) "Escaping the Confines of Normative Thought: A Réévaluation of Puebloan Prehis- tory." Among the many issues raised by this essay, several turned out to orient discourse about the southwestern archaeological record in the coming decade, and remain important research issues today. The authors attacked the applicability of analogy from contemporary or historic Pueb- los to prehistoric Pueblos and belittled the "overemphasis of population- limiting strategies ... in recent archaeological . . . literature." In the wide spread of the Kana'a design style they saw extensive alliances among local groups appearing as early as the period between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1000, in part to buffer risks among increasingly agricultural populations living in areas depleted of wild resources. And, of course, the authors argued for greater variability than had normally been admitted in con- temporaneous settlement systems, architectural form, "strategies," and, especially, the kind and degree of sociopolitical organization among later Puebloan groups. A significant subset of the dialog over this bundle of challenges to traditional interpretation became known as the "Grasshopper-Chavez Pass" controversy, after the two large, late prehistoric sites along the Mo- gollón Rim in the northwestern reaches (Forestdale Branch) of the Mo- gollón area, around which the debate crystallized. The most obvious point of difference between the rival camps had to do with how late prehistoric Puebloan polities were organized (Wilcox, 1991a). Also controversial, how- ever, were the primacy of excavation vs survey data (Lightfoot and Upham, 1989b, p. 592); the degree to which theory generation and testing should</page><page sequence="3">News from the Northern American Southwest 269 be privileged over exhaustive search for the effects of cultural and non- cultural formation processes when matching models to data (Cordell and Upham, 1989; Reid et al., 1989; Reid and Whittiesey, 1990); the appro- priate roles of both general and specific ethnographic inference based on recent societies (Levy, 1991; Lightfoot and Upham, 1989a; Upham, 1987); and the influence of historical trajectories of interpretation - and their contextual biases - on current interpretation (Cordell, 1989a; Feinman, 1989). As we enter the period of interest here, the portions of the debate specific to the Grasshopper-Chavez impasse have begun to die down, per- haps, as Wilcox (1991a; p. 128) notes, because "neither side has yet ade- quately published the data that ostensibly form the basis of their positions." What the southwestern archaeologist is left with is an increasing openness to the possibility of hierarchical sociopolitical organizations in Puebloan prehistory; an increased reluctance to accept the ethnographic models avail- able for current and historic southwestern peoples as the only plausible models for prehistoric puebloans; and considerable confusion about how specific models of prehistory might be validated, given the vagaries of ar- chaeological data and the ease with which three archaeologists can look at the same 2,000-room pueblo and conclude variously that it was (a) the seasonally occupied home of a highly mobile Puebloan population over a 250-year period, (b) a major population center whose affairs were managed by a hierarchically structured decision-making organization, or (c) a settlement exactly like Walpl. (Upham and Reed, 1989a, p. 58) This, then, is one of the two meanings of "chaos" that I intend in the title. If ever there was in the Southwest a unanimity about what prob- lems are important to address, and how they should be approached, that agreement proved brittle to the assaults of the 1980s. Linda Cordell (1992) enumerates a dozen or so active theoretical orientations in prehistoric ar- chaeology as a whole; echoes of most of these can be found in varying interpretive stances and research agendas in the Southwest. However, the effectiveness of various ecological approaches for understanding culture change in these environments (which, on a large scale of comparison, are marginal for agriculture and sensitive to climatically induced change and human impact) has allowed these positions to remain more dominant than they are, for example, in Europe. Toward the end of this paper, another meaning for the title is suggested. Instead of trying to address separately the questions posed in the first paragraph, I attempt to weave selected empirical findings and comments on emerging research directions into a largely chronological framework. Although at base this article is topically oriented, the topics of interest manifest themselves slightly differently in various periods.

PALEOINDIAN, EARLY, AND MIDDLE ARCHAIC In the Southwest, the transition from glacial to postglacial vegetation and climate occurred between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago, and woodland vegetation continued to decrease until some 5000 years ago (Hall, 1985, p. 95). Parry and Smiley (1990, pp. 50-51) attribute the "apparently spotty and ephemeral Paleoindian occupation" of the Four Corners area to the undesirability for Pleistocene megafauna of the coniferous forest, inter- spersed with grass/sage parklands, that appears to have dominated the Pia-</page><page sequence="6">272 Kohler teau at this time. Conditions in the early Holocene were cooler and moister than present climates in the same areas, whereas the maximum warm/dry conditions generally reached between 7000 and 5000 years ago were warmer and drier than present climates (Hall, 1985, p. 118). The piñon-juniper forests so common on the Plateau today between about 2100 and 1600 m appear to be well established around 8000 B.P. (Betancourt, 1990; Parry and Smiley, 1990, p. 51). Dry fanning and runoff farming in this piñon-juniper zone on the Colorado Plateau later provide the context that separates "Anasazi" adaptations from the Sonoran desert-dwelling, canal-building "Hohokam" and from the diverse area in between, with complex vertical zonation and abundant wild resources but generally poor prospects for dry farming, the "Mogollón." I agree with Lekson (1992a; see also Reid, 1989, pp. 65-66) that these are most usefully regarded as names for broad adaptations, not for ethnic groups or, in most periods, political entities. The earliest Archaic in this area is recognizable through projectile points resembling Bajada, Pinto, or San Jose types, and is poorly repre- sented. What is known of the slightly later portions of the early Archaic in the western section of our area is, still, due to the 1960s excavations in Desha Complex sites of Sand Dune and Dust Devil Caves of southeastern Utah (Parry and Smiley, 1990, pp. 53-54). For northwestern New Mexico, Vierra (1990, p. 62) reviews more recent excavations in transitional Pa- leoindian/Early Archaic Jay sites that suggest that a "broad-spectrum econ- omy" making great use of lagomorphs, with a significant amount of ground stone in the lithic assemblage, was in place by at least 7500 years ago. W. H. Wills (1988b, p. 88) finds Early Archaic projectile points throughout west-central New Mexico to be "astonishingly similar," perhaps reflecting low populations and low social boundary maintenance; Middle Archaic forms were more distinctive along what Wills takes to be nonfunctional dimensions (but see Preucel, 1990). Archaic subsistence, in general, is not terribly well understood. Evi- dence for Archaic use of piñón, for example, is curiously slight (Matson, 1991), and it has been suggested that piñón remains are subject to system- atic deterioration biases (Toll, 1992, p. 51). In her examination of Archaic plant use in the San Juan Basin, Toll (1988) emphasizes dependence on a few economic taxa, especially rice grass among the grasses and goosefoot (Chenopodium) among annual weeds [however, the relatively small sample sizes at such sites may be influencing our view of niche breadth; see Leonard (1989a) for extended discussion of such problems]. Analysis of Desha Complex coprolites [6000-8000 B.P. (Van Ness, 1986)] underlines the dietary importance of Sporobolus (dropseed), prickly pear, and Che-</page><page sequence="7">News from the Northern American Southwest 273 nopodium. Until the Late Archaic [and even then, away from riverine set- tings in the Basin and Range of southeastern Arizona (Huckell, 1990), and, possibly, along portions of the Rio Grande], high group mobility, small groups, short-term occupations (Toll, 1988), and large territories apparently characterized Archaic land-use systems (Matson, 1991, p. 202). Such con- siderations help explain the huge spatial distribution of the "Archaic-Ab- stract" rock art tradition, mapped by Cole (1990, p. 42) as extending from southern Wyoming to the Little Colorado and east almost to the Rio Grande; inclusion of the similar Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style (Schaafema, 1980) in this tradition would extend its boundaries even farther south. Such may be the appropriate scale for thinking about Archaic and even early horticultural adaptations; Lekson (1992c), after all, reminds us that the summer/fall and winter/spring homes of the Warm Spring Chiri- cahua Apache were 650 km apart. Later I review evidence for declining nutritional status with increas- ing agricultural commitment. John Speth (1990), however, draws our at- tention to current worldwide research among hunter-gatherers, noting the presence of chronic resource inadequacies among these members of the original affluent society and stressing the probability that Southwestern foragers, too, were heavily exposed to selection during stressful periods or "adaptive bottlenecks." R. G. Matson (1991, pp. 129-202), who has summarized evidence for Archaic occupations all over the Southwest (for other broad reviews see Vivian, 1990, pp. 79-100; Wills, 1988b, pp. 49-89), concludes either that, during the Middle Archaic (roughly 6000-4000 B.P.), the Colorado Plateau was largely depopulated or that earlier land- use systems were heavily disrupted by the Altithermal; evidence for this period on the Plateau tends to be scanty and variable in nature. For the Mogollón Highlands, however, Wills (1988b, p. 67) argues for increasing population during the Middle Archaic and, in the more general context of the Mogollón Highlands, Plateau, Rio Grande, and Trans-Pecos, sees the heaviest emphasis on the use of valley and basin areas during the Early and Middle Archaic, with increased usage of upland environments during the Late Archaic. THE LATE ARCHAIC AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CULTIVATED PLANTS At first their crops set lightly upon them Kidder [1962 (1924), p. 326] What may be the oldest maize in MacNeish's Tehuacán Valley col- lections has recently been redated using direct AMS techniques to no</page><page sequence="8">274 Kohler earlier than 4700 B.P. [calibrating to about 3600 B.C. (Long et al, 1989)]. These ages are some 2000 year younger than previously accepted and put a firm upper bound on the age of maize in the Southwest. If this redating is sustained by future work, the spread of maize into the South- west was relatively more rapid, and the domesticating societies in Mesoamerica, relatively more sedentary and populous than previously be- lieved. The specific pathways by which maize, beans, and squash were intro- duced to the Southwest and the reasons why they were accepted into the forager regime when and where they were remain contentious, even though the timing of these events is better understood now than a decade ago. An aggressive 14C dating program at Three Fir Shelter and elsewhere on and near Black Mesa in northeastern Arizona has yielded an earliest de- termination on maize of 3610 ± 170 B.P. (Smiley, 1993) calibrating to 2232 B.C., suggesting that only 1000 to 1400 years was needed for maize to spread from the highlands of Mexico almost to the San Juan River. Early 1980s reexcavation of Bat Cave in the Mogollón Highlands of east-central New Mexico yielded direct ages on maize no earlier than 3120 ± 70 B.P. (Wills, 1988b, pp. 108-109) calibrating to 1491-1320 B.C. (Wills, 1992, p. 154); Wills considers one 600-year earlier date possibly contaminated, but it is not out of line with the earliest Three Fir maize age. Along with a calibrated date of 1733-1112 B.C. on maize from Tornillo Rocksheiter in the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces (Upham et aL, 1987), the determi- nation from Three Fir Shelter and Bat Cave are the earliest reliable ages for maize (Matson, 1991, pp. 245-265; Smiley, 1993; Wills, 1988a, p. 454, 1992, p. 154; Wills and Huckell, 1991). Central tendencies for earliest direct dates on squash (Cucurbita pepo) are slightly later but have standard de- viations (and calibrated ages) that overlap with those of the early maize from Bat Cave (discounting the possible outlier) and Tornillo. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), on the other hand, have earliest dates in the mid-first millennium B.C. and probably arrived later than either maize or squash. The Three Fir dates, as well as late but still early determinations on maize of 770 B.C. from a small open site east of Chaco Canyon and another on squash at 950 B.C. (calibrated to 1430-830 B.C) from nearby Sheep Camp Shelter, document some central Plateau horticulture at least as early as the earliest dates from the northern Mogollón (Simmons et ai, 1989, pp. 59-60). Until 200 B.C. or so, most evidence for early cultigens in the area comes from rockshelters. First use of cultigens had no profound effect on settlement or sub- sistence strategies for at least several hundred years following their intro- duction (Wills, 1992); according to Wills and Huckell (1991), agricultural</page><page sequence="9">News from the Northern American Southwest 275 production served primarily to enhance foraging efficiency. If so, it is un- doubtedly due in part to the difficulties of coupling a highly mobile lifestyle with effective cultivation; Welch (1991) has demonstrated the dramatic yield reductions that result from predator damage in untended Apache fields near Grasshopper. As Matson (1991, pp. 241-243) suggests, maize cultivation may have fit more readily into the existing seasonal round (pos- sibly featuring a summer base camp) in riverine portions of the Basin and Range than it would have either on the Plateau or in the Mogollón High- lands. Wills (1992, p. 158) reconstructs the role of Bat Cave as a storage and processing site to which mobile Late Archaic populations returned in the early spring to utilize maize stored in a previous autumn, and links this behavior to a "desire or need to be in this area prior to the availability of wild foods . . . probably ... to assess the distribution and abundance of key resources that would not be available until fall." Perhaps influenced by work at Guilá Naquitz (Flanneiy, 1986), Wills appears reluctant to consider this earlier-than-expected use of the uplands in the spring as a subsistence intensification or to link the general adoption of agriculture with any possible regional imbalance between population and wild resources. It seems, however, too early to rule out "population pres- sure" as playing some role in this transition (Nelson et al, 1992). Steven James (1990), for example, interprets the rapidly increasing diversity of ar- chaeofauna in Ventana Cave deposits that just predate agriculture, vs the pattern of slow increase in diversity after that time, as indicating just such regional imbalances, and laments the absence of published data on bone breakage for marrow extraction in sites of this age, as a possibly more sen- sitive index of subsistence stress. Matson (1991, p. 183) concludes that there is widespread evidence for increased importance of Sporobolus (dropseed) in premaize Late Archaic diets, possibly to be interpreted as a sign of eco- nomic intensification. Finally, Wills (1988b, p. 60) presents histograms of uncalibrated C determinations of preceramic southwestern sites (exclud- ing the Basin and Range) that show a slow but apparent increase in num- bers of dates beginning about 4500 B.P., which increase more rapidly after about 2900 B.P. The earliest increases occur in the south and at low ele- vations; frequencies increase later in the north and at higher elevations. Of course, these trends in frequencies of 14C determinations may be influ- enced by many factors, including sampling variance, nonrepresentative re- search agendas, differential site preservation, diversifying Archaic land-use patterns, a late development of complex vegetation zonation in the high- lands that would be attractive to foragers (Wills, 1988, p. 64), and increasing numbers of people trending from south to north, and from lowlands into uplands, through time.</page><page sequence="10">276 Köhler R. G. Maison (1991) has proposed a three-stage model for integration of maize into southwestern economies that posits slow selection from a primitive Chapalote-like ancestor toward forms with increased tolerance for drought, deep planting, and short growing seasons. In the first stage, by 1000-800 B.C., floodwater farming [it might be better to think of this as water-table farming (Huckell, 1992)] was practiced in a more-than-desul- tory fashion by somewhat sedentary populations in riverine Basin and Range settings; by around 500 B.C., coincident with the inception of the earliest, "White Dog" Phase of Basketmaker II, similar cultivation practices became important on lowland portions of the Colorado Plateau. Gumer- man and Dean (1989, p. Ill) likewise argue for a "substantial commitment to maize" on Black Mesa by about 600 B.C. Finally, by A.D. 200 or shortly thereafter, dry farming on higher elevations in the Plateau became signifi- cant [however, for the western Anasazi area, Gumerman and Dean (1989, p. 114) emphasize the continuing importance through Basketmaker III times of fanning in lowland alluvial floodplains]. Bruce Huckell (1992) criticizes Matson's model for its explanatory emphasis on maize cultivation practices [which are difficult for archaeolo- gists to reconstruct, although site (Matson et al, 1988) and storage cist locations provide some assistance], its emphasis on modern Chapalote to reconstruct the requirements of primitive southwestern maize, and the near-contemporaneity of the earliest dates for maize across the Southwest. Wills (1992) also emphasizes the apparent rapid spread of cultigens after their initial appearance and the lack of diversity in cultigen morphology in early southwestern collections (presumably due either to lack of human selection or to high mobility preventing isolation of incipient varieties). For his part, Matson, who appears to be less interested in explaining the earliest appearance of maize in any area than in modeling when and where it be- comes significant in the economy, would minimize the subsistence contri- bution of maize in early highland settings such as at Bat Cave and in pre-500 B.C. settings on the Plateau. THE GREAT DRY-FARMING MILLENNIUM: CA. A.D. 300-CA. A.D. 1300 Accepting in principle Matson's developmental outline (see also Köhler, 1992), dry farming and simple runoff farming become the major (though usually not the sole) strategies for maize production early in the first mil- lennium A.D. Some canal irrigation was practiced in the Mimbres area by perhaps A.D. 1000, and various water-control strategies develop in Chaco</page><page sequence="11">News from the Northern American Southwest 277 Canyon at roughly the same time. Intensive and varied water-harvesting techniques such as those practiced in the northern Rio Grande region (An- scheutz, 1992), however, do not come to dominate production strategies until late in prehistory. During the dry-farming millennium farmers are triply sensitive to en- vironmental factors. Seeking adequate precipitation, they occupy higher elevations susceptible to shortened growing seasons. All suitable elevations, however, are subject to relatively unpredictable combinations of low- and high-frequency climatic fluctuations that not infrequently lead to inade- quate precipitation. Finally, mesa-top plots are most productive early in their life cycles, and since their expanse is vast, they are used unsustainable The relatively great emphasis that many Anasazi students place on envi- ronmental factors in understanding demographic change and the emphasis in many quarters on prehistoric "risk management" in explaining changes in social, political, and settlement structure seem therefore better suited to these times than to earlier and later periods. Even during this period, some careful analyses indicate important departures from trends based on envi- ronmental expectations, at least when those expectations are based on nar- row considerations of high-frequency climate change (e.g., Plog and Hantman, 1990). Increasingly Sedentary Occupations and the Development of Pottery Anasazi and Mogollón ceramics diversified after about A.D. 500 or 550 from an initially unified base recently defined as the "Early Brown Ware Tradition" (Wilson et al, 1992). In portions of both areas [from at least Pine Lawn Valley in the south to the Navajo Reservoir in the north, and west at least to Petrified Forest National Park (Burton, 1991) and the Prayer Rock District of northeastern Arizona], ceramics locally known by names such as Alma Plain, Los Piños Brown, and Adamana Brown share great similarities in "resource selection [for self-tempered pedogenic and alluvial clays], vessel form [necked jars, seed jars, and bowls], and forming and firing technology" (Wilson et ai, 1992). Among the earliest Plateau populations using these brown wares are those with, perhaps, the greatest commitment to horticulture; for the period following 100 B.C. in the east- ern portions of the area, Vivian (1990, pp. 92-94) reconstructs substantial differences between the relatively high agricultural commitment of "Los Piños variant" Basketmaker II populations (in the Navajo Reservoir area) and the more mixed, mobile patterns of "Late En Medio Variant" Basket- makers throughout the central and southern San Juan Basin.</page><page sequence="12">278 Kohler Only after about A.D. 550 did Anasazi potters begin to use local geo- logic clays, thus founding the famous Gray Ware tradition (Wilson et al, 1991). Illese clays were superior to the local alluvial or pedogenic clays, but temper had to be added. Even after that time, as Wilson and Blinman have recently demonstrated (Wilson, 1992), firing practices remained simi- lar in both areas (achieving a neutral to slightly oxidizing atmosphere), and therefore, the classic distinction between the Anasazi and the Mogollón gray and brown ware traditions - erected on the basis of differing firing atmosphere - now appears to be due only to selecting the best available local clay resources. Also underlining early historical connections between the Anasazi and the Mogollón areas (which, like "tribe," may soon have to be placed within quotation marks) is Matson's (1991, pp. 13-124) re- thinking of the Basketmaker II period, in which similarities with the Mo- gollón range from the obvious ramp entryways coming into pithouses from the south or southeast to more subtle similarities in the chipped and ground stone assemblages (Matson, 1991, p. 55). The interconnected factors that by the mid-first millennium A.D. led to increased regional differentiation probably include range restriction with increasing population, increased commitment to horticulture, in- creased use of storage, and increasingly sedentary occupation (Gumerman, 1993). [Most archaeologists who are unwilling to attribute any causal role to demographic factors in the local adoption of agriculture do recognize population increase as a result of, or as a coevolution with, its successful prosecution; see, for example, Leonard (1989b)]. Jonathan Haas et al (1991) also mention closing-off of social networks, increased interaction within regions, decreased interaction between regions, and historical, con- tingent factors - such as the relative proximity of the Hohokam to the northern borders of Mesoamerica - as important to this process. Stephen Plog (1990, p. 187) attributes the increasingly small geographic extent of style zones (in the last part of this millennium) to a change from isochres- tic to symbolic variation, that is, toward messages that convey a particular social identity. There are probably regional differences in degree of sedentism and reliance on maize. Wills (1991) contrasts Shabik'eschee Village (overlook- ing Chaco Canyon and part of Vivian's En Medio variant) and the SU site, some 200 km to the southwest in the Mogollón Mountains; both date to the mid-first millennium A.D. and are classic examples of early southwest- ern villages in their areas. As characterized by Wills, Shabik'eschee has small pithouses (probably not occupied by "families or households"), a rela- tively low wild-resource productivity, a putative low agricultural productivity for dry farming, a small internal storage capacity (but some antechambers</page><page sequence="13">News from the Northern American Southwest 279 and some possible storage behind wingwalls), obvious oversized pitstruc- tures, lots of obvious external storage cists, and few in-pithouse burials. Wills (1991, p. 173) suggests that these features diagnose a communal eco- nomic system prevalent among hunter-gatherers "wherein households do not occupy individual pithouses or exclusively control storage" (see also Plog, 1990, p. 185). The SU Site has opposite characteristics on these di- mensions and is suggested to be closer in economic organization to Flan- nery's (1972) rectangular-house settlement type, wherein the basic economic unit is the family controlling its own storage. Wills hypothesizes that the shift from one to the other is associated with efforts to maintain resource control through a hereditary claim symbolized by the increased level of capital investment and mortuary practices. Linked to this model is the claim that the SU villagers were more reliant on agriculture, with Shabik'eschee forming primarily around peri- odic large piñón masts (Wills and Windes, 1989). [Alan Sullivan (1992) also argues that the importance of piñón in "agricultural" diets has been consistently underestimated, at least in the Grand Canyon area and, per- haps, in the Anasazi world in general] This is in contrast to Matson's (1991) vision - based on analysis of settlement patterns, coprolites, flotation samples, and, most contentiously, stable carbon isotope determinations on human and animal bone from the Cedar Mesa area (Matson and Chisholm, 1991) - of quite agriculturally involved adaptations on the Plateau by pre- Shabik'eschee, Basketmaker II times. The estimated percentage of C4 plants in the diet for Basketmaker II populations on Cedar Mesa is nearly as high as for local Pueblo Will populations and much higher than for a control Archaic (Desha Complex) individual; in fact, these Cedar Mesa Basketmaker II populations have some of the highest estimated C4 con- tributions ever found in the Southwest. Unlike Matson, Wills (1992, p. 159) interprets these high estimates from Cedar Mesa as reflecting intensive use of "relatively low return re- sources, such as grasses and desert succulents [many of these are C4 or CAM, which can give values similar to C4 pathways in dry environments] as well as rabbits and small mammals that feed extensively on C4 plants." This argument, however, does not explain the high Basketmaker II values relative to the Desha individual, who would probably have had a diet rich in Sporobolus (C4), followed by prickly pear (CAM), Chenopodium (C4), and Helianthus (Ci) (Van Ness, 1986). Furthermore, Hard (1990, p. 143) has noted that the average mano length (a proxy for agricultural intensi- fication) is greater in Chaco at this time than in the Pine Lawn area. More- over, Decker and Tieszen (1989) calculate similarly high percentages of dietary C4 for a long series from Mesa Verde that begins in Basketmaker</page><page sequence="14">280 Kohler III times; unfortunately, their sample depth for the earliest period is only one individual. Coprolite analysis corroborates this high and relatively con- stant maize intake from Basketmaker III times on for the larger Four Cor- ners area (Minnis, 1989b), and Vivian (1990, p. 112) (who, to be fair, does not ascribe great agricultural commitment to any En Medio population) reconstructs San Juan Basin climates from A.D. 400 to A.D. 700 as being "good for horticulture." Finally, review of packrat midden macrofossils, pol- len, alluvial pollen, and hearth contents has suggested to Hall (1988) that piñón was never abundant in Chaco Canyon. Following Lekson (1992b), I suspect that "the uniform paucity of hunter-gatherer resources led to early and wide-spread adoption of corn agriculture on the Plateau: corn is both bountiful and reliable." In sum, it seems likely that Plateau Basketmaker populations (in- cluding those at Shabik'eschee) were more reliant on maize than were con- temporaneous Mogollón highlanders (see also the discussion of the Late Pithouse period under "Mimbres and Casas Grandes," below); explanation of the possible differences in household organization between the two, therefore, remains unsolved. The problem, I think, is that the equation between foraging societies and communal storage/production, vs. agricul- turists and household storage/production, is too coarse. Even in foraging societies where food sharing is important, there tends to be variability in sharing according to resource type. Gathered resources (often the prod- ucts of women's work) are typically things coming in small "packages" and have relatively low variance; these tend not to be shared as widely as meat and fish, especially where these come in large packages [see, for example, the Ache (Kaplan and Hill, 1985) and the Machiguenga (Baksh and Johnson, 1990); Hames (1990) documents the extremely low sharing rate for garden produce among the Yanomamo]. If horticulture creeps into southwestern economies as an extension of women's gathering, its products may not be widely shared among households, particularly if pro- duction variance was low. Perhaps the first "communal" storage of maize in the Southwest- if in fact such storage ever occurs- is in late Chacoan contexts (see below) when surplus production may have been extracted from households. The First True Villages and Some Hints of Regional Systems Although sites such as SU (with 30-35 pitstructures) and Shabik'es- chee (with perhaps twice that many) are frequently called sedentary vil- lages, it is not apparent that all (or even most) of the structures were occupied contemporaneously or that the occupation was year-round. Patri-</page><page sequence="15">News from the Northern American Southwest 281 eia Gilman (1987) has argued that pithouses in general represent winter- only occupations, and I have found some possible support for Gilman's position in the Dolores area, where ceramic deposition rates for households living in pithouses are lower than for those living in later pueblos in the same area (Nelson et al, 1992). Of course, this effect could be due to any number of causes, including a shorter use-life for pithouses than for pueb- los, unsuspected variability in household size, changes in cooking patterns, breakage rates, or household ceramic inventories, or - as proposed - more seasonal usage of pithouses than surface structures. The first settlements in the Southwest that clearly correspond to Flan- nery*s rectangular-house type appeared in the northern Southwest about A.D. 760. By this time, pitstructures were still used but increasingly appear to be shared by two or three households living primarily in surface struc- tures [perhaps representing extended families; Lightfoot (1992), however, suggests that pitstructures remain the focal point for individual households]. According to the standard interpretation, storage by this time is clearly as- sociated with the household. The literature that has grown up about these Pueblo I villages - due in great part to the Dolores Archaeological Project (Breternitz et al, 1986) - is too vast to be summarized in detail, but a few provocative details may be noted. • Villages in the Dolores area (at least) form in times of above-av- erage precipitation and usually, but not always (Wilshusen and Blinman, 1992) collapse in periods of low precipitation, sometimes accompanied by signs of personal violence (Orcutt et al, 1990; Schlanger and Wilshusen, 1990). Increases in local population den- sity accompany aggregation, although regional population may still be relatively low (Wilshusen, 1991). In the western Anasazi area, Pueblo I villages are relatively later, smaller, and more often found in floodplain settings (Gumerman and Dean, 1989, p. 116). • The apparent crowding of PI populations into better-watered por- tions of the Southwest is probably related to responses of dry farm- ers to patterns of low-frequency desiccation, which bottomed out around A.D. 900 (Petersen, 1988) or slightly earlier (Plog et al, 1988, p. 235). Sarah Schlanger (1988) and Schlanger and Wilshusen (1990) have also linked movements of dry farmers within this area to patterns of high-frequency climatic fluctuations. • Wild resource depletion, especially of wood for fuel and construc- tion (Köhler and Matthews, 1988) and piñón seeds (Floyd and Köhler, 1990), accompanies and, on finer time scales, may precede village formation (for related discussion see Kohler, 1992b; Speth and Scott, 1989).</page><page sequence="16">282 Kohler • Aggregation entrained a greatly increased distance to fields and the pattern of village growth suggests that reducing overlap among agricultural catchments of villages was a high priority (Kohler et al, 1986; Orcutt et aL, 1990). I have interpreted the pattern and timing of fieldhouse construction around Dolores villages as indi- cating that agricultural lands were a scarce commodity against which visible claims were made at an atomistic level (by individuals or households), although fields may have remained communal (vil- lage-level) property in theory (Kohler, 1992a). • Early villages were short-lived and may be little different in terms of sociopolitical organization from the preceding dispersed pattern (Wilshusen, 1991), although there are some slight hints for a si- multaneous, two-tiered decision-making hierarchy in the largest Dolores village (McPhee) during the A.D. 860-880 period (Kane, 1989; Wilshusen, 1991). One kind of evidence for this inference lies in scales of ritual integration, which seems to have been cen- tered around Great Kivas in times of dispersion. On aggregation, however, Great Kivas may be replaced by (1) very large pitstruc- tures (within large, semicircular roomblocks) with rare, ritual floor features that perhaps serve to "integrate" roomblocks within a community [Wilshusen's (1989) ceremonial rankings 1 and 2] and (2) smaller but still oversized pitstructures with less elaborate floor features, which appear to integrate groups of households within a roomblock [Wilshusen's (1989) ceremonial rankings 3 and 4]. Eric Blinman (1989) has shown that nonlocal red ware bowl shards are differentially associated with the first group and has argued that this represents a form of feasting in which residents of roomblocks without such structures would bring food (in red ware bowls) for "potluck" consumption (but see Lekson, 1989a). • Villages generally occur in clusters (Wilshusen and Blinman, 1992). On the basis of the Dolores experience, villages within a cluster may be largely contemporaneous, but at least some of the clusters were not simultaneously occupied; all those in the Mesa Verde re- gion appear to date to either A.D. 760-800 or A.D. 830-880. The relative strength of resource availability and social considerations in determining locations and spacing of the clusters is unknown. • Evidence for a regional system linking the clusters comes mostly from the distribution of red wares, made in southeastern Utah but occurring in the Dolores area at maximum levels of about 8.5% of sherds in refuse collections from the early ninth century (Blin- man, 1989, p. 117). However, if Blinman is correct about the proc-</page><page sequence="17">News from the Northern American Southwest 283 esses by which these red wares moved through all the households in a village to become slightly concentrated in the largest room- blocks with the most elaborate ceremonial facilities, it would be misleading to think of this as an alliance in the sense of Upham and Reed (1989a, p. 69), who consider "the differential distribution of specialized commodities that may not have been available to all members of the community" to be a defining feature. Moreover, the broad distribution of Kana'a-like designs on the white wares of this period should not be explained solely by exchange of these vessels; in the Mesa Verde area, at least, white wares appear to be locally manufactured (Blinman, 1988), even though their pro- duction was probably not undertaken by all households. Some com- bination of village- or cluster-level mobility, intermarriage, and relatively low-level exchange seems adequate to explain the white ware design distributions and the generally synchronous character of change in this period. In sum, the evidence for this period seems in accord with the assertions of Gumerman and Dean (1989) that trade networks do not necessarily imply nonegalitarian organiza- tion and that differential distribution of materials does not neces- sarily imply restricted access. Regional Systems: Chaco, Mimbres, and Casas Grandes There is an expanding archaeological entity in the Southwest that may soon rival the worlds largest organism, the huge fungus re- cently discovered in several counties of a mid-western state. Lekson (1992c) Some Background The concepts of regional system and alliance (Plog, 1983; Upham and Reed, 1989a) have been invoked with increasing frequency over the last decade to characterize various supralocality similarities present at least in- termittently for the last 700 years or more of southwestern prehistory. For later prehistory, when they are most obvious, Upham and Reed (1989a, p. 59) define alliances as "coherent organizational units with formal interac- tive ties to other comparable units" and claim that "the articulation of large populations at regional scales gives rise to ... increased organizational complexity" (original emphasis). Therefore, "restricted access to labor-in- tensive commodities, the intensification of agriculture, moves toward craft specialization, and other such processes may be considered epiphenomenal</page><page sequence="18">284 Köhler to the process of regional system formation" (Upham and Reed, 1989a, p. 59). In discussing such larger networks of interaction, the lowest interest- ing level of analysis is the settlement cluster (Upham and Reed, 1989a, pp. 61-64; see also the discussion of Pueblo I villages above). For the central and northern Southwest during the late prehistoric period, Upham and Reed (see also Jewett, 1989) define some 20 clusters, averaging 50-70 km apart and encompassing areas of some 2500 km . These local clusters, at least in some times and places, may have in- teracted with each other to define "provinces," "alliances," or regional sys- tems. Upham and Reed (1989a) emphasize the importance (both for the operation of regional systems and for their identification in the archae- ological record) of restricted zones of production coupled with widespread exchange. Wilcox (1991a) focuses on the development of no-man's lands between regional systems- apparently due to interregional competition - as key identifying features (see also Upham, 1992). The nature of the political and economic organization within regions is of course controversial and may, in fact, have been very fluid. It would not surprise me if, at various times and places, intraregional ties ranged from loose links of identification to stronger links of coordination and perhaps centralization [using all three terms in the sense of Adams (1975)]. Wilcox (1991a, p. 131), for example, has proposed that the late prehistoric northern Tewa and Piro systems were governed by councils, which, if present, were presumably more coordinative than centralized in nature. Chaco The Chaco regional system began to crystallize in the early tenth mil- lennium, just after the demise of the Pueblo I villages further north. Due in great part to survey and excavation in the 1970s and early 1980s by the National Park Service's Chaco Center, recent publications on the phenome- non fill a small bookshelf [(Crown and Judge, 1991a; Judge, 1989; Mathien, 1991; Mathien and Windes, 1987; Sebastian, 1992; Vivian, 1990; Windes, 1987b); Judge (1991) presents a concise summary of Chaco research as of 1987]. Underlying most recent work is the tendency to enlarge the size of the system centered on Chaco. Steve Lekson (1991, p. 146) uses "commu- nity pattern - [presence of] great house, great kiva, unit houses, and (often) road segments" to define a Chaco region (of some 112,500 km , excluding a problematic site on the Rio Grande) stretching deeply into eastern Ari- zona and slightly into southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado. [See Toll (1991) for a less expansive view.] Recent models for the rise and de-</page><page sequence="19">News from the Northern American Southwest 285 cline of the Chacoan system are thereby cast in large terms (Neitzel, 1989). Key issues include how and why the system emerged and the nature of the economic and political linkages between communities in the region and between the "great" and the "small" houses - in other words, how the sys- tem functioned and why it collapsed. Gwinn Vivian (1990) presents a coherent but complicated view that takes as a basic strategy the identification of various subregional groups within the San Juan Basin, derived originally from the adaptational/geo- graphic split between "Los Piños" and "Late En Medio" populations. A key element in his explanatory strategy is the belief that a dual division (as preserved by the Tewa moieties) arose among the more complex (north- ern) groups in the Basin very early, perhaps initially developing among Los Piños populations as within-community specializations in hunting versus horticulture. Dualistic organizations continued to define sociopolitical re- lations in later phases within this "San Juan Tradition" - La Plata (A.D. 400-700), Piedra (700-850), Early Bonito and Ackmen (850-1000), Classic Bonito and Mancos (1000-1080), and Late Bonito and McElmo (1080- 1170). On the other hand, the Late En Medio variant found a "Cibola Tradition" with simpler, lineage-based organizational tendencies. In the San Juan tradition, dual divisions are architecturally visible, Vivian (1990, pp. 491-492) contends, from at least A.D. 850 in Chacoan-San Juan residential structures that were "consistently characterized by a two-cycled duplication of social residential units from an original core." Within great houses (founded as residences of San Juan Tradition-Piedra enclaves within local dispersed Cibola Tradition-White Mound-Kiatuthlana populations) in Chaco Canyon, political complexity never moved beyond the "rotating se- quential hierarchy" provided by the moiety system; the nine great houses within the canyon were not politically united; and their marked 'Vertical nucleation" can be interpreted, at least in origin, as serving to make a highly visible claim on prime agricultural lands. [By his choice of Tewa ethno- graphic models, Vivian wishes to emphasize the relatively egalitarian nature of Chacoan society. Ironically, Upham (1989) has recently interpreted these same Tewa social forms as containing marked asymmetries of opportunity, especially in degree of access to esoteric knowledge. Still, many observers consider the Tewa practice wherein subgroups jealously guard their own esoteric information as a way of requiring community-wide ritual partici- pation and impeding centralization (W. D. Lipe, personal communication, 1993).] Some degree of greater political control, however, may later arise be- tween the great houses in the Core (a rectangle of some 1040 km2 centered on Chaco Canyon) and their daughter settlements. Indeed, for Vivian</page><page sequence="20">286 Kohler (1990), what used to be called "outliers" are best regarded as daughter settlements that fissioned from great houses in the core to form San Juan enclaves within various local populations. This interpretation is generally in line with that of Warburton and Graves (1992) for Navajo Springs (ca. A.D. 975-1125), which they consider to be a "frontier outpost" founded within a Wingate community on the Rio Puerco of the West because of the intrusion of the architectural form and a Chacoan road into an area with an established population. The various local populations outside as well as within the Core - the occupants of the small houses - were not in- corporated within the "span of control" of the great-house organizational systems. The interactions between these two organizational systems, between the mother and the daughter communities, and the climatic events of the period between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1200 form the defining dynamics of the Chaco system as Vivian depicts it. Favorable climatic conditions in the 900s permitted Early Bonito populations to found great houses such as Pueblo Alto and Kin Bineola outside the canyon but within the core, in areas already occupied by Cibola-Red Mesa populations. Expansion into the Basin continued with a second generation of San Juan Tradition (now Classic Bonito variant) enclaving, from the core outward, under the relatively favorable climatic regimes of the 11th century (Vivian, 1990, p. 479), many linked by roads to the core [see Mathien (1991a) for a sum- mary of Chaco road research]. These enclaves may have facilitated local access to highly desirable commodities such as turquoise, but for Vivian (as for Toll, 1991, p. 183) such exchanges probably exerted little leverage in defining the system. [Toll (1991) makes the important point that the system did move large quantities of utilitarian goods, including stone, ce- ramic vessels, and wood.] Large-scale water systems were developed in the core during this period, from earlier, simpler roots. However, these developments were not sufficient to shield populations from 50 years of dry conditions beginning about A.D. 1130, and an exodus from the Core that had perhaps begun in the late 1000s was completed by around A.D. 1150. The other recent book-length treatment of Chaco is in many ways complementary to that of Vivian, without accepting his dual-culture model. Lynne Sebastian (1992; see also Sebastian, 1991) provides much less cultural-historical detail than Vivian but works harder to identify the general problems (segmentation, legitimation, competition, and succes- sion) that leaders must solve in institutionalizing their control and to sug- gest how, specifically, these problems were addressed at Chaco. Following Antonio Gilman (1981), Sebastian argues that societies frequently main-</page><page sequence="21">News from the Northern American Southwest 287 tain themselves as egalitarian by using segmentation (or fissioning) as a control on the aspirations of potential leaders. For Chaco, however, the investment in water-control technology (if indeed this is an early tenth- century development, as would be required for Sebastian's model) would make leaving a costly option, especially in view of the fact that, with its side canyons, in an otherwise barren landscape, Chaco represents an oasis of high potential productivity under water-control technology that could not easily be recreated elsewhere in the Basin (see also Crown and Judge, 1991b, p. 294). Interestingly for her argument, major early tenth-century construc- tion of great houses in the canyon (at Peñasco Blanco, Pueblo Bonito, and Una Vida) took place near the mouths of major side canyons where water control was productive, as if to stake a claim on those resources (see also Judge, 1989, pp. 218, 223). [Small houses, in this model, serve populations involved in a land-extensive agriculture; the probable exist- ence of a two-story great house at Pueblo Bonito by the mid-ninth century (Wilcox, 1991b) is not addressed.] Moreover, early tenth-century great- house construction coincides, albeit imperfectly, with times when dry farm- ing was somewhat unproductive, according to Sebastian's simulation of corn production based on retrodicted annual precipitation patterns. In the relatively small-scale political processes from A.D. 900 and 1020, leaders legitimized themselves through generosity to their followers and through the appearance (assuming high productivity) of special access to the di- vine. From the episodic nature of early construction at these great houses, Sebastian argues that the problem of succession had not been solved dur- ing this period. A different pattern obtains during the period from 1020 to 1100. With the exception of its final decade, this period was generally favorable for dry fanning [and, presumably, for farming under the water-control tech- nologies as well; not all Chaco scholars, however, are as enthusiastic as Sebastian about the productivity of these water-control systems (Judge, 1989, pp. 227-228)]. This period in general, but especially its last half, "was a time of multiple, continuous, overlapping construction events" (Sebastian, 1992, p. 120; relying on Lekson, 1984). The power base for leaders during this period was, ultimately, the surplus generated by continued overpro- duction under these favorable conditions. Sebastian argues that by, or dur- ing, this period, by virtue of their long domination and success, leaders had come to be viewed as having a hereditary link to the supernatural and could now legitimately serve as mediators to these powers (using the increasingly formalized great kivas that appeared in this period as a theater?) in return for the right to some portion of the continued household-level surplus. Competition among leaders (and great houses) during this period contrib-</page><page sequence="22">288 Kohler uted greatly to the overbuilt look of Chaco and extended into the Basin as leaders in canyon great houses funded construction of roads, great kivas, and great houses among outlying client populations, using work groups of clients paying their labor obligations. [Jill Neitzel (1989, pp. 532-535) in- terprets the settlement pattern data for this period as showing a four-tiered, highly centralized settlement hierarchy, with Pueblo Bonito and the sur- rounding great houses in the canyon functioning as a unified, primate, ur- ban core]. With the institutionalization of leadership the succession problem would have been solved, as is implied by the nearly continuous construction at canyon great houses, especially during the latter half of this period. Sebastian identifies a third pattern for the final, A.D. 1100-1130 pe- riod of Chacoan development, for which she reconstructs the highest and most continuous social surpluses of production. Among the obvious changes in this period are shifts to carbon-painted ceramics with new design motifs, the construction of lines of rooms that enclose plazas at great houses, the appearance of bi- and triwall structures, and the construction of many small "McElmo phase" structures that Lekson (1984, p. 269) considered to be separate, specialized storage facilities. The periodic deposition of large quantities of trash in the mounds fronting some of the great houses - which suggested to Judge (1989, pp. 241-242) the operation of something like a pilgrimage fair attended by populations throughout the Basin - now ceased. Although Lekson (1984) considers this period to represent the acme of Chacoan complexity, Sebastian slightly favors the view that great house leaders "lost face" during the downturn in production in the 1090s. There- after, the center of new competition for followers switched to outliers on the edges of the Basin, such as the Aztec complex, which now appears to have been the focus of a much larger-than-suspected community, in Late Bonito times (Stein and McKenna, 1988; see also Judge, 1989, pp. 247- 248). Whatever the case for this mysterious period of the early 1100s, the dramatic downturn in productive potential between A.D. 1130 and A.D. 1180 resulted in demographic and system collapse within the canyon that cascaded down the client chain to the outliers as well (Sebastian, 1992). The 1150s can also be thought of as marking the end of the Pueblo II period in the western Anasazi area, which between 1000 and 1150 had ex- tended dramatically into the county north of the San Juan, the Grand Can- yon, and beyond into southern Nevada; the Cohonina, Virgin Anasazi, and Fremont largely collapsed around A.D. 1150 (Gumerman and Dean, 1989, pp. 118, 121). Larson and Michaelson (1990) view the depopulation of the Virgin Branch area at this time as due to low runoff, fluvial degradation,</page><page sequence="23">News from the Northern American Southwest 289 and drought; Rafferty (1989b, p. 579) acknowledges a possible contributory role for such processes but gives causal primacy to the collapse of the Cha- coan trade system, which he believes to have been supplied with turquoise and shell by the Lost City system (but see Wilcox, 1991b, p. 6). Chaco itself was not, apparently, occupied in an important way after the mid- 1100s, although Wilcox (1991b) believes that we have consistently overes- timated the extent of depopulation and system collapse in 12th-century Chaco and argues for the existence of some form of polity centered on Chaco throughout the 1100s. In this same paper, Wilcox sketches a model for the political evolution of the Chacoan polity that differs dramatically from the views of Vivian, Sebastian, and most other Chacoan scholars. If the resident population in Chaco was beyond the local carrying capacity [and given the uncertainties surrounding population and productivity estimation at Chaco, this is pos- sible but far from proven (Vivian, 1991)], and if earlier models for Basin- wide redistribution in support of the core population are discredited, then one way to explain this population anomaly is through coerced tribute. For Wilcox, the famous subfloor burials in Old Bonito become war leaders; the highly disarticulated human remains above them and in neighboring areas of the oldest portion of the site - always or nearly always associated with the otherwise rare cylindrical jar - the remains of periodic sacrifices of war captives or tributary victims; and the state that originates from a (somewhat putative) 10th-century network of great houses centered on Chaco, and stretching from Skunk Springs to the northwest to San Mateo on the south- east, a device for capturing a portion of the production of neighboring populations. The great house/small house dichotomy indicates the emer- gence of a two-class system by the early 900s. Roads are interpreted as mechanisms for moving 40-man armies to rebellious areas of the domain quickly (or, more economically, for symbolizing the possibility of interven- tion) and for channeling tribute (carried by the outlying populations) into Chaco. The line-of-sight communication system, which for Judge (Crown and Judge, 1991b, p. 295) served to signal "simultaneous commencement of ceremonies" from the "central archive of esoteric knowledge" that was Chaco Canyon, for Wilcox would carry military intelligence; the "aureoles" (Fowler et aly 1987) that surround several sites in the fertile Rio Puerco of the West area were stockades. By the mid-llth century, Chaco's "threat radius" extended some 4 days' travel (-88 mi) to the south and west and, by the 1080s or 1090s, had incorporated the middle San Juan-Animas-La Plata area through conquest. Chimney Rock Pueblo and other great houses served in part as barracks.</page><page sequence="24">290 Köhler Presented in these bare outlines, and juxtaposed with Vivian's and Sebastian's more traditional treatments, Wilcox's thesis may appear unlikely at best. However, when read in the context of Wilcox and Haas' (1993) compelling summary of the widespread evidence for competition and con- flict in the Southwest, it is apparent that this model deserves careful em- pirical evaluation. Fortunately, it is open to testing at several points, for example, by determining with greater precision the timing of outlier con- struction (on which Wilcox and Vivian differ dramatically) and road build- ing [Windes (1991), for example, presents ceramic seriations suggesting that formal roads did not appear in the central canyon until the mid-llth cen- tury (see also Judge, 1989, pp. 225, 243), although a few roads outside the canyon may be constructed in the 10th centuiy], the character of the "aure- oles," the plausibility of great houses functioning in part as barracks, and so forth. Different as they seem, the three Chaco models presented here do share several points, including the view that the regional system emerged out of developments within the canyon, rather than vice versa, and the identification of religion as an important legitimizing force in the emer- gence of leaders (although, for Wilcox at least, religion was but a thin veil for coercion). Mimbres and Casas Grandes The Mimbres regional system, marked by finely made black-on-white ceramics with distinctive naturalistic and geometric designs and a fairly uni- fied architectural style of contiguous cobble-walled surface structures, be- came visible along the southern border of the Mogollón Highlands around A.D. 1000 and covered an area of some 56,000 km2 (Haas et al, 1991). According to Dean et al (1993), population in the Mimbres area increased fairly slowly until about A.D. 800 and then more rapidly, peaking shortly after A.D. 1100 and then declining radically by shortly after A.D. 1200 (to pre-A.D. 600 levels in the Mimbres Valley, although the population in the nearby Cliff-Gila area probably increased). Depopulation was complete by A.D. 1450. Lekson (1990a, p. 90) emphasizes the insecurity of Mimbres paleodemography relative to many portions of the Anasazi area. The apparent population peak, of course, corresponds to the Mimbres phase (also known as the Classic Mimbres period; see Table I). Changes in the two-handed mano area in the Mogollón Highlands suggest marked agricultural intensification by around A.D. 1100 (Mauldin, 1991) but a rela- tively low agricultural intensity before that time, a scenario in agreement with Lekson's (1989b) view of the Pithouse Period as "basically hunter- gatherer" in orientation. Robert Hard (1990) also views the Mimbres phase</page><page sequence="25">News from the Northern American Southwest 291 as heavily agricultural but sees intensification taking place earlier, a position in line with that taken by LeBlanc (1989) and Nelson (1992a). Prehistoric agricultural terraces above the Mimbres and nearby streams contain only sherds datable to the Mimbres phase (Sandor, 1990); their soils, inciden- tally, retain degradative effects (relative to adjoining soils) more than 800 years after their apparent last use for agriculture. As is true for the Chaco florescence, the rise of the Mimbres system coincided with, and perhaps depended upon, the particularly favorable rainfall patterns of the 1000s (Minnis, 1985). The Mimbres phase did not spring up without precedents. Some Late Pithouse period villages such as Galaz had up to 60 contemporaneously occupied pithouses [seemingly on the high end for "hunter-gatherers" and also too large according to Lekson (1993)], and moderate and large vil- lages typically had Great Kivas and plaza areas (LeBlanc, 1989). In con- trast to some earlier interpretations (e.g., Lightfoot and Feinman, 1982), LeBlanc (1989) sees no evidence for nonegalitarian structure in these vil- lages. Michael Diehl (1992) generally concurs with this position on the basis of his reanalysis of materials from another large site, the Lee Site, although he notes that one household in his analysis presents evidence for "entrepreneurial activities" in its accumulation of shell, larger than expected on the basis of floor area. The shell beads, pendants, and neck- laces that are fairly common in the larger villages appear to have been manufactured in the Hohokam area, and similarities in ceramic design and in some stone tool types (including palettes) with the Hohokam are striking, especially toward the end of this period (LeBlanc, 1989). After about A.D. 900, however, the Hohokam influence on Mimbres-area de- velopment is less obvious, although the large Mimbres phase towns were supported primarily by canal systems, as in the Hohokam area (Lekson, 1992a). LeBlanc (1989, p. 189) points out that the surface structures that were one innovation of the Mimbres phase provided "large areas dedicated to food storage" and characterizes the local pithouse-to-pueblo transition as a fundamentally economic process, in response to "food provisioning stress." Lynne Sebastian (1992) similarly argues that surface structures in true villages appeared (at a slightly earlier time, in the Anasazi area) as part of a strategy of attempting to produce more than one year's require- ments each year - "overproduction" - using storage as the principal hedge against poor years. On a more speculative note, LeBlanc suggests that the shift may also have been accompanied by a movement from households based on nuclear patrilocal families to households based on extended ma- trilocal families (see also Ham, 1989). In partial contrast with the Anasazi</page><page sequence="26">292 Kohler area at this time, the architectural layout of Mimbres phase towns-^which may have up to 300 rooms - seems relaxed and informal, and LeBlanc (1989) sees little evidence for either social stratification within villages or macrovillage organization; there is, for example, no obvious site size hier- archy, and canals served the lands of single villages only. There were about a dozen large towns in the Mimbres valley during this period. In her analysis of burials from one of these - the Mattocks site - Gilman (1990) notes the conspicuous absence of the sorts of large, showy items (such as shell trumpets, turquoise-encrusted "baskets," and so forth) considered emblematic of elites in Chaco (Akins, 1986). Most burials contain one of the famous Mimbres black-on-white bowls, inverted over the head. About 1.5% of burials are cremations (Creel, 1989), and these, while they are more likely to contain rare items such as projectile points, jewelry, and multiple vessels, also lack "emblems" of status by Gil- man's criteria. Gilman interprets variability in burial treatment as reflect- ing horizontal (achieved) social differences, perhaps based on relative wealth. As is also the case for the decline of the Chaco system, the collapse of the Mimbres system in the mid-1 100s is correlated with decreasingly fa- vorable climates for agriculture and precedes the development of the "Casas Grandes Interaction Sphere" centered on Paquimé (Dean and Ravesloot, 1993; LeBlanc, 1989). Paquimé is usually considered to have been the most politically complex and centralized organization in the greater prehistoric Southwest, a presumption with which Minnis (1989a) agrees, although he questions Di Pesos' original identification of a market at Paquimé. In the 1200s the Casas Grandes system expanded to a size (by some accounts) of 100,000 km2, slightly less than the largest estimates for the Chacoan regional system, and by other accounts (Minnis, 1989a), to 53,000 km2, equal to minimal estimates for the Chacoan system. Casas Grandes-related sites and materials, which contrast sharply in ceramics and architecture with earlier materials where they appear in the U.S. Southwest, are referred to the Black Mountain phase in the Mimbres area; the El Paso phase to the east, in the Jornada Mogollón; and the Animas phase in Hidalgo County (LeBlanc, 1989, p. 194). Margaret Nelson (1992b) sug- gests that with the abandonment of the large Mimbres valley villages be- tween about A.D. 1130 and A.D. 1150, some former villagers, moving in small groups, may have settled in the eastern Mimbres region, boosting its population and residential stability. By LeBlanc's (1989) reading, the Paquimé system grew to incorporate the area that was formerly part of the Mimbres system, displacing Chaco as the primary supplier of southwestern goods to Mesoamerica.</page><page sequence="27">News from the Northern American Southwest 293 Among these goods, turquoise presumably was preeminent. Harbottle and Wiegand (1992) note that in Mesoamerica, the demand for turquoise (much of it from southwestern sources, especially the Cerillos sources near Santa Fe) apparently increased after the 12th century "when Chaco seems to have lost its monopoly." James Judge (1989, p. 236) emphasizes the role that turquoise played in the initialization of the Chaco system, even sug- gesting that beyond its role as a commodity of ritual importance, by the 11th century turquoise had "acquired the additional function of informally regulating exchange of other material items." Harbottle and Weigand (1992) link the rise of Casas Grandes to its service as a turquoise entrepôt and its success in opening many new turquoise sources. Paul Minnis (1989a), on the other hand, tends to minimize both interaction between Paquimé and even the most northern Mesoamerican polities and the evi- dence at Paquimé for turquoise trade or specialized production. Instead, he suggests that peer-polity models that stress interaction with the Ho- hokam to the north and west, and with the Salado in between, will be most useful in understanding the rise of the Paquimé polity. As was the case for Chaco, most basic questions about how the regional system arose, operated, and declined are in debate for the Paquimé system, but the data base for understanding these southern developments is poorer. After Chaco: Reorganization and Abandonment of the Four Corners After a few decades of restabilization, the apparent depopulation of the old center of the eastern Anasazi world around A.D. 1150 brought population and development to the former peripheries of the Chacoan sys- tem. In the western Anasazi area, the northern San Juan-Mesa Verde area, and the Cibola area, a relatively even distribution of unit pueblos (some- times, outside the Kayenta region, accompanying great houses) metamor- phosed into a pattern of towns separated by nearly empty areas (Adler, 1992; Fowler et al, 1987; Gumerman and Dean, 1989, p. 1221; Kintigh, 1990a, 1992; Rohn, 1989b, p. 158). Lekson (1992c) attributes this to the decline of the Pax Chaco that had allowed villages (in pre-Chaco times, the basic unit of Anasazi adaptation and mobility) to decompose safely into their smaller constituents. Other areas that had had little previous oc- cupation [e.g., the northern Rio Grande (Cordell, 1989b; Crown et al, 1990) and portions of the western Mogollón (Reid, 1989)] were first colo- nized at this time by populations with serious agricultural intentions. Due to space limitations, I am cruelly restrictive in my coverage of this period and the next. Two issues seem to me to be of general interest in this period - the nature of "kivas" and the continuing controversy over</page><page sequence="28">294 Kohler the causes for the abandonment of the Four Comers region around A.D. 1275. It has always been doctrine in the Southwest that, from Pueblo II times, the relatively small, usually circular, masonry-lined, underground chambers in Anasazi sites were primarily ceremonial spaces, with domestic activities concentrated in adjacent (usually masonry) surface rooms (for background see Hegmon, 1989, Lipe and Hegmon, 1989b). Richard Wil- shusen (1989, p. 103) proposes that kivas appeared in late Pueblo I times, when he can differentiate two classes of pitstructures - a small size, serving two to eight households as a "common place for special economic activi- ties, as well as a place for group rituals" and containing simple or complex sipapus; and a larger "community" kiva, serving at least 20-30 households, with floor vaults. The size distinction between "corporate" and "commu- nity" kivas does not appear to carry over into Pueblo III times (Lipe, 1992); Lipe (1989) argues that most Pueblo I- III protokivas and kivas probably integrated small groups, of the order of an extended family. Ca- ter and Chenault (1988) and Lekson (1988, 1989a) have challenged the view that any pre-Pueblo IV kiva smaller than a great kiva was purely or primarily devoted to ceremonial activities, arguing, in essence, that kivas remained an important locus of residence until Pueblo IV times. In re- sponse to this challenge, there has been a renewed attempt to examine closely the role of the pitstructure. Within the small, Pueblo I Duckfoot site, for example, Varíen and Lightfoot (1989) find evidence for both ritual and domestic use of pit structures but identify only domestic features and artifacts in surface rooms. Bruce Bradley (1992) suggests that some kiva units (kivas integrated with suites of surface rooms) at the large, late Pueblo III Sand Canyon Pueblo were domestic, whereas others were spe- cialized and nonresidential. If these specialized kiva suites were used by sodalities - and it is not clear that Bradley would endorse this sugges- tion - then some of the social reorganization that is usually believed to have begun around A.D. 1275 may, in fact, have commenced earlier and farther north. Michael Adler (1989; Adler and Wilshusen, 1990) addresses the issue of kiva function by noting that in a cross-cultural sample of nonstratified societies, integrative facilities tend to be nonspecialized (that is, they are used for domestic activities as often as for ritual activities) when they serve only a portion of the community and when community size is relatively small (less than about 200). Most pre-Pueblo IV, nongreat kivas would be- long to this class. The size of the group using these facilities increases as the community size increases, presumably explaining some of the size-class differences in pit structures noted by Wilshusen in Pueblo I contexts. Spe-</page><page sequence="29">News from the Northern American Southwest 295 cialized ritual facilities, on the other hand, tend to be devoted to integrating entire communities, or groups of communities, and are more common in community sizes above about 200; great kivas and post-A.D. 1300 kivas fall into this group. The cross-cultural regularities are probably explainable through scalar stress theory (Johnson, 1989). Clearly, the days are gone when it was possible to make a facile equation between small kivas and exclusively ceremonial space. The implications of this for paleodemographic estimation have yet to be worked through, although Lekson (1988) has made some provocative suggestions here as well. Somewhat less consensus appears to be developing on the ever-popu- lar issue of the "abandonment" of the Four Corners; in the past few years we have seen the gamut of explanations ranging from the purely climatic to the purely social. Ken Petersen (1988, 1992) argues that low-frequency climate trends made the northern Southwest uninhabitable by horticultu- ralists by virtue of the cold, dry conditions that began in the late 1200s with the onset of the Little Ice Age and prevailed for some 600 years. Fred Plog and colleagues (1988, pp. 260-261) similarly argue that the great aban- donment (and in fact most of the other, smaller abandonments in the Anasazi record) was linked to low-frequency trends toward low effective moisture. Carla Van West (1990) reviews the position that the (high-frequency) "Great Drought" reconstructed for the late 1200s on the basis of tree rings was the cause for the depopulation but presents detailed agricultural pro- duction data, also based ultimately on tree-ring records, indicating that - even during this period- her 1470 km2 study area in Southwest Colo- rado could have supported some 20,000-30,000 people through dry farming (see also Van West and Lipe, 1992). This would, probably, have been suf- ficient for the population in the same area. However, she points out that if mobility were limited [say, by prior community claims to reliably produc- tive lands, as argued by Adler (1990)], or if no region-wide "redistribution" systems were in place, then locally serious shortfalls could have surfaced at various times but particularly toward the end of the occupation. Arthur Rohn (1989b) is inclined to the view that the late 1200s immigration from the northern San Juan area was due to "purely social, political, or religious factors," although he does not develop his argument in any detail. To com- plete the explanatory spectrum, the old hypothesis that hostile nomads pre- cipitated the abandonment has recently been revived, with the nomads now identified as Numic speakers (Ambler and Sutton, 1989; but see Rafferty, 1989a). Jay Palmer (1992) argues for a very early immigration of Apachean Dineh (Southern Athapaskans) into the Southwest, whereas Wilcox (1988) restates the case for a ca. 1500 [or slightly earlier (Hogan, 1989)] entry.</page><page sequence="30">296 Kohler At a more abstract level, Lipe (1992) suggests that we may err in attempting to find causes for this depopulation that are proportional to the effects. Drawing on a branch of complex adaptive systems theory de- veloped by Bak and Chen (1991), Lipe suggests that the large communities in southwestern Colorado had evolved toward a state of "self-organized criticality" in which - as in a pile of sand to which no more may be added without causing some kind of avalanche - all subsystems are sufficiently in- terconnected that any minor perturbation may ramify through the entire system. One interesting characteristic of systems at criticality (or "at the edge of chaos") is that it cannot be predicted whether a minor perturbation will cause a minor or a major avalanche. Therefore, this famous depopu- lation, which appears to have had major consequences for the remainder of Puebloan prehistory, could have been the result of some relatively minor perturbation. Van West and I have recently developed a unified theory to explain both the aggregation and the disaggregation and abandonment visible in Van West's study area between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1300 (Köhler and Van West, 1992; Van West and Köhler, 1992). We use microeconomic princi- ples to argue that it will be in the best economic interests of households to aggregate in times of relatively high production coupled with high spa- tial and temporal variability [see Plog et al (1988, p. 273) for a partially contrastive prediction]. Conversely, households should "defect" from vil- lage life (and its attendant sharing obligations) in times of low average production coupled with high temporal and spatial variability; such defec- tion may entail some agricultural disintensification, although probably not as dramatic as that discussed by Upham (1984). These predictions are gen- erally borne out in the record, although aggregation seems somewhat more probable (and defection somewhat less probable) than predicted when population levels are high, probably because of the relatively unattractive nature of the landscape for disintensification under such conditions or, perhaps, due to the danger of disaggregation in conditions of endemic warfare. According to these microeconomic principles, the period from A.D. 1272 to A.D. 1288 during which the Four Corners was depopulated was found to be the least attractive time for aggregation in the entire 400-year sequence. We contend that the depleted nature of the landscape by this time precluded defection into the surrounding area and that long-distance immigration (predicted as taking place in small groups) was the logical re- sponse. It is interesting to note that Ezzo (1992, p. 269), on the basis of excavation data, reconstructs a similarly "low level of community inclusive- ness" in responses to food stress during the latest occupation of Grasshop-</page><page sequence="31">News from the Northern American Southwest 297 per. Slightly similar also is Haas' (1989, p. 507) argument that the Kayenta region was depopulated when an increasingly defensive posture in the mid- 1300s prevented the village mobility on a generational scale that had pre- viously served to prevent local resource depletion. Haas reasons that this effect, coupled with regional environmental deterioration, was sufficient to force region-wide abandonments. The probability that social organization at this time linked like units together only through upward chaining (i.e., families are linked to other families through extended families or lineages, which are in turn linked to like units through clans, which are in turn linked to like units through vil- lages) also enhanced the ease with which high-order entities (such as vil- lages) could disintegrate along the lines of their lower-order components. Later social and religious organization almost certainly enhanced lateral chaining (e.g., linkage of households through fraternities, kivas, priesthoods, and so forth) in addition to their linkage through a high-order, more or less kinship-based entity. In the first form, households are directly linked only to very closely related households. In the second case, households have many direct links to nonrelated households as well as to some closely re- lated households. Exactly how this putative reorganization was accom- plished remains an important research problem. THE PROTOHISTORIC: THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES Whatever its causes, the depopulation of the Four Corners ushered in the last major era of southwestern prehistory. Between A.D. 1275 and A.D. 1350, new social forms, religious practices, and large-scale interactive systems became established throughout the area. Among these changes are a possible increase in household size and composition (Crown and Köhler, 1990); a dramatic increase in the ratio of rooms to kivas and the appear- ance of new kiva forms (Lipe, 1989; Adams, 1989b); the general disappear- ance of great kivas and their replacement by plazas (Adams, 1989b); widespread aggregation, fueled in part by rapid population growth in re- fugia and areas where water-control systems were productive (Adams, 1989c; Köhler, 1989); broad population dislocation, recognizable in part through rapid local ceramic change (Montgomery and Reid, 1990); and the emergence of widely shared ceramic design styles in polychrome and bichrome, coupled with the appearance of new ceramic technologies (Crown, 1992) and of the katsina cult, which by the mid-1300s was practiced throughout the Puebloan Southwest with the possible exception of the Taos area (Adams, 1991, p. 3). Most of these changes appear to be interrelated.</page><page sequence="32">298 Kohler A continued retrenchment in the total area of occupation, which by the mid-1400s had resulted in depopulation of the Verde Valley, the central Little Colorado, the White Mountains, the Gila-Salt Basin, and the Casas Grandes region (Gumerman and Gell-Mann, 1992), has received much less attention than the earlier, northern abandonments. A macroeconomy featuring exchange of maize, cotton products, ob- sidian, turquoise, and pottery for buffalo products was in place by the mid to late 1400s between the Rio Grande pueblos and peoples of the southern Plains (Spielmann, 1991), although Spielmann and others (1990), using bone strontium concentrations and stable isotopes, were unable to demon- strate that bison replaced mule deer in the later human diet at Pecos Pueblo. For the fifteenth century, Riley identifies seven large provinces in the Greater Southwest within which he reconstructs dense economic, cul- tural, political, and religious interaction (1990, p. 230). In our area, these provinces are the Pecos, the Rio Grande, and the Little Colorado. In con- trast to the Serrana province of the Upper Sonora, Riley considers the puebloan provinces to be basically egalitarian; high religious offices con- ferred high prestige but did not constitute an elite class. Wilcox (1990, 1991a), however, considers constructs like the "Rio Grande Province" to obscure important internal "ethnic alliances" such as the Piro and the northern Tewa. There was considerable production for trade purposes, and considerable warfare, "mainly defense against the threat of marauding no- mads" (Riley, 1990, p. 234). In general, the cultural landscape seems similar enough to that at contact that, without great exaggeration, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries can be termed the Protohistoric period. Patricia Crown (1992) associates the origins of the Pinedale decora- tive style in east-central Arizona in the late 1200s with immigration of populations from the Tusayan-Kayenta region. Many other local popula- tions soon "converged" on this style, and it spread rapidly on glazes of various traditions, associated (in Crown's analysis) with a regional cult - presumably linked to, if not isomorphic with, the katsina cult - that probably enhanced stable cooperative relationships in a time of general upheaval. Charles Adams (1991, p. 185) likewise places the development of the katsina cult in the Upper Little Colorado Valley in the early 1300s, with roots, ultimately, in northern Mexico, and argues that its widespread adoption "stemmed from the social, political, and economic roles [it] played in the structure of each village." The public nature of most ceremonies, coupled with restricted access to the most esoteric knowledge, served the needs of village leaders simultaneously to bind their diverse populations together and to enhance their own prestige (Adams, 1991, pp. 185-186). Cult membership and practice, which cross-cut kin networks, may have</page><page sequence="33">News from the Northern American Southwest 299 added an important stabilizing element to post-A.D. 1300 villages that made the sort of village fissioning just discussed for the Mesa Verde region less practical (Ferguson, 1989); it should be pointed out that frequent war- fare might have had a similar effect. If the extremely poor health and short life expectancy inferred from the Arroyo Hondo skeletal series (Palkovich, 1980) are generally applicable to the early portions of this period, biological disruption may have played some role in the broad and rapid acceptance of the cult. Because the protohistoric is close to our own in time, our interpre- tations ought to be characterized by great clarity. Unfortunately this has not been the case, because of the great size and complexity of most set- tlements of this period, because the most ambitious excavations of these sites were carried out during the birth of our discipline, and because of a host of theoretical and methodological problems (including basic chrono- logical control) touched on under "Background: The Great Debate of the 1980s/' above. Acrimonious debates continue over the linked issues of late prehistoric population size, sociopolitical organization, and the role of European-introduced diseases. There is a vague polar opposition between scholars who reconstruct high prehistoric population levels, incline toward relatively complex sociopolitical forms, see an important role for European diseases in very early history, and distrust specific ethnographic analogy (e.g., Dobyns, 1990; Upham, 1982) and those with generally opposed views (e.g., Kintigh, 1990b; Schroeder, 1992) [Other positions are possible: Wilcox (1991a, 1992) combines a distrust of "extreme disease hypotheses" with a vision of sociopolitically complex protohistoric societies and a dislike for specific ethnographic analogy.] Large-scale projects, such as that envisioned by Haas and Creamer (1992), would be desirable to make progress on these issues. Rather than dwelling on this period in detail, I prefer to move on to summarizing a few emerging research programs. Here again, I must skip over many interesting developments, such as the increasing and often pro- ductive tendency to incorporate analyses of iconography (especially from rock art) into interpretation of prehistory (e.g., Cole, 1989; Kodack, 1990; Matson and Cole, 1992; Rohn, 1989a; Schaafsma, 1989; Turpin, 1990; Young, 1988), a task that will be abetted by recent direct age determina- tions on pictographs (e.g., Farrell and Burton, 1992; Geib and Fairley, 1992). Also notable is an increasing reflexivity in examining the develop- ment of our own discipline (e.g., Christenson, 1990; Downum, 1990; Haury, 1989; Lekson, 1990b; Wills, 1990). The new directions I discuss are most visible in publications dealing with the late prehistoric/protohistoric period, but the interpretive issues raised apply across the spectrum of prehistoric occupation.</page><page sequence="34">300 Kohler RECENT TRENDS, PROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS Life, Death, and Disease / can envision an Anasazi historian, writing (petroglyphing) in the 12th century A.D., "Our numbers continue to grow, but we do not feel very well " Swedlund (1992) A few years ago, McGuire (1989b) criticized Minnis' (1985) study for (among many other things) being unable to demonstrate that food stress actually occurred in the Mimbres area "in the absence of skeletal evidence." As if in response to such objections, several remarkable studies on skeletal materials have recently appeared, using many new methods. Among these are stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone collagen (for a methodological overview, see Katzenberg, 1992), analysis of trace, minor, and major elements, and detailed osteological analyses to reconstruct mor- tality curves, survivorship curves, and prevalence of conditions such as enamel hypoplasias, porotic hyperostosis, dental attrition, caries, abscessing, and tooth-loss rates that inform on various dimensions of health and well- being (e.g., Martin et al, 1991; Stodder, 1987, 1990). Of the recent overviews taking such data into account (Merbs, 1989; Stodder and Martin, 1991; Swedlund, 1992), that of Nelson et al (1992) is particularly useful for summaiy purposes because it aggregates many indi- ces of demographic and physiological insults to form a general impression of degree of "biological disruption." Except in the Mesa Verde sequence, they conclude that there is not a notable increase in biological disruption in local sequences through time [but Martin (1993) sees an increase in some pathologies in the protohistoric]. For Chaco Canyon there are indications of better nutritional status and higher life expectancy for individuals buried in Pueblo Bonito than for those buried in other contemporaneous sites, but the rarity of such situations in the prehistoric Southwest is underscored by Ezzo's (1992) finding of no bone chemistry or stable isotope differences at Grasshopper that he attributes to better nutritional status for an elite group. Nelson et al (1992) also conclude that (except for the Chacoan and Paquimé elites) Wellness generally declines with increasing population den- sity, which in turn is often accompanied by agricultural intensification. In general, recent overviews stress that - contrary to the myth that the Native American "lived a basically healthy and happy existence largely devoid of illness" (Merbs, 1989, p. 41) - infant mortality was very high, in- testinal and body parasites were rampant, and communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and venereal syphilis were present at low rates, whereas</page><page sequence="35">News from the Northern American Southwest 301 infectious diarrhea was probably very common (Martin, 1993; Merbs, 1989). Susan Kent (1986; see also Reinhard, 1988) argues that the porotic hy- perostosis seen in many southwestern populations should usually be attrib- uted to sedentism and aggregation leading to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, rather than to diets high in maize but low in meat, and cites studies showing that a decrease in circulating iron can be induced "as a nonspecific defense the body employs against invading pathogens, neoplasia [cancer], and inflammation" (Kent, 1992, p. 7). Although such findings call into question the automatic assumption that symptoms of anemia are due to diet rather than to disease, most scholars still reconstruct dietary stress as both common in the southwestern record and variable in intensity at different times and places and under different organizational scenarios (otherwise, it would be difficult to explain the apparently healthier status of elites at Chaco and Paquimé, who, after all, live in aggregated, sedentary settings). Presumably diet, disease, and anemia are all linked within a single system. A definitive breaking of the linkage between anemia and diet would somewhat limit the application of strictly subsistence-oriented economic ap- proaches to southwestern prehistory, although such explanations might re- tain their force at a more distant causal remove if they succeeded in explaining sedentism and aggregation. Competition and Conflict The Indian tribes of the Southwest were peace-loving . . . through their reverence for their sources of sustenance, these Indian people showed us their belief in community. Acatos (1990, p. 24) Long dominated by ethnographic models of socially cooperative, eco- systemically sustainable forms (which live on in coffee-table books), views of southwestern prehistory are broadening to include an important role for resource depletion and for competition and warfare in social process (e.g., Adams, 1989a; Haas, 1990; Kohler, 1992b; Upham and Reed, 1989b; Wil- cox and Haas, 1993). Aggregation is increasingly viewed as a defensive tac- tic in many times and places [(Lowell, 1991, pp. 62-63); but see Stone (1992) for the Zuni area] or, alternatively, as a strategy to minimize in- tervillage conflict in the context of competition for arable land (Orcutt et al., 1990). Wilcox and Haas (1993) present evidence that religious practices included human sacrifice in times and places as diverse as the Mimbres phase, the Chacoan florescence, and the Rio Grande Classic.</page><page sequence="36">302 Kohler Cannibalism - identified on bones through cut marks, pot polish, per- cussion marks, breakage, burning, and archaeological context - seems more prevalent than could have been imagined only a few years ago (see Turner, 1989; Turner and Turner, 1990, 1992; White, 1991, 1992, and references therein). Peter Bullock (1991) has argued that many of these claims for cannibalism in fact represent cases of violent death and corpse mutilation; Villa (1992, pp. 102-103) counters that in at least some cases, the high degree of fragmentation, rarity of articular ends, breakage following burn- ing, and so forth, are more consistent with the cannibalism hypothesis. De- spite the accumulating numbers of claims for cannibalism, it was probably a relative^ rare act with little nutritional importance. Van West and I (Kohler and Van West, 1992) have suggested that most cannibalism in the Mesa Verde area between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1300 took place in times when villages were falling apart as households defected from sharing obligations; perhaps defection was not acceptable to all parties. One implication of an increased role for conflict in the Southwest is the probability that cooperation on one level is, in part at least, a response to conflict or competition on a more inclusive social level. For example, cooperation among kin groups in a village is undoubtedly promoted by con- flict between villages; regional systems, or alliances- if they represent co- operation among villages or clusters of villages - could be strengthened by conflict between regions (or alliances). The original direction of causality is less clear, however; and it seems likely to me that cooperation initially self-organizes at a given social level because of structural factors and system dynamism, and only then does the existence of these more inclusive social entities promote the formation of others through competitive processes. Models, Global and Local Although most archaeologists agree that spatial scales larger than a river valley are essential to understanding southwestern prehistory, there has been less agreement on what a productive framework for large-scale analysis might look like. Randall McGuire (1989a; see also McGuire et aL, 1993) provides a perceptive critique of the limits of world systems and peer polity theory for these purposes in the prehistoric Southwest. In their place he advocates an eclectic Marxism that has the great advantage of linking processes on the household level to processes in increasingly broader thea- ters. The structure of the model also provides a useful way for thinking about how environmental, social, and ideological processes are intercon- nected.</page><page sequence="37">News from the Northern American Southwest 303 These linkages are achieved, first, by defining a kin-ordered mode of production at the household level (McGuire argues that tributary modes never characterized the Southwest). This mode of production "limits the extent of inequalities that can exist" but does accommodate potential dif- ferential ranking of lineages (McGuire, 1989a, p. 47). The next step is to define an economic system in which modes of production and societies are linked; McGuire argues that by the end of the first millennium A.D., im- portant segments of the Southwest were participating in a "prestige-goods economy" in which political power was associated with non-locally pro- duced social valuables. Individuals able to obtain and control access to these items, which are required for validating "major social and religious transitions" in the human and social life cycle, can create dependencies by supplying them to subordinate individuals in return for surplus production (McGuire, 1989a, p. 49). At the highest levels, superordinate individuals link region to region "so that any disruption in the supply or flow [in] one affects the other." The obvious example of such a system in our area is that of Chaco, which from this perspective linked an Anasazi prestige-goods economy to the older and more complex prestige-goods economy of Mesoamerica. Social valuables flowing north included macaws, copper bells, "and a handful of pseudo-cloisonné items'«' (McGuire, 1989a, p. 55). These appear to have been prestige goods retained at the paramount level in the Chacoan system; items more amenable to passing down within the system included marine shell, turquoise, painted wood, and perhaps cylinder jars. As indicated above, turquoise passed into the Mesoamerican system from the Southwest. Given this model, it is easy to see how environmental (or social) dis- ruption in either region, or disruption of long-distance exchange networks between them, could threaten leadership status in either region (but par- ticularly in the less developed); the macroregional system is hypercon- nected. Desiccation in the San Juan Basin, for example, could diminish the surplus flow on whicS lineage heads depended to obtain prestige goods, thereby diminishing their power. To the extent that their power is con- nected with symbolic and ritual items and acts, the prevailing ideology is threatened as well. I find such a framework extremely helpful in understanding the de- mise of the Chacoan system. McGuire tries to extend the logic to the de- population of the Four Corners area, but the applicability of the model there is undermined by the apparent paucity of nonlocal goods in Pueblo III Mesa Verde contexts. In a more general sense, however, the model helps us understand how a "démystification" of the ideology that legiti- mized the Chacoan (and perhaps the later Mesa Verdean) system caused by leaders' loss of symbols of power would have laid bare the "contradic-</page><page sequence="38">304 Kohler tions in the existing moral order ... for all to see" (McGuire, 1989a, p. 57), setting the stage for rapid spread of a new ideology (i.e., the katsina religion) that McGuire interprets as a crisis cult. In Pueblo IV Rio Grande contexts, "the wealth of the past, no longer attainable because of the col- lapse of the earlier prestige-goods economy, lives on on kiva walls, on ce- ramic vessels, and in clay copies - imitative magic to recover the glories of the past and ensure the cycle of the universe" (McGuire, 1989a, p. 59). Complex systems of the sort that McGuire describes often behave in ways that are not intuitively predictable. Moreover, in any verbal model there are endless possibilities for fuzziness in definition of terms and logic. Finally, it is not always clear from such descriptions how systems add hi- erarchical levels or increase in complexity; in general, how structural change is accomplished and why it is - or is not - promulgated through the system remain uncertain. It may be time to return to formal models of culture change that can be put into motion, on the computer, to study their dy- namics. Important advances outside of anthropology in modeling complex systems give us the beginnings of tools that might enable us to revisit simu- lation with the enthusiasm shown in the 1970s but with, I think, more useful results. %&lt; As practiced particularly in the 1970s in archaeology, systems theory featured large flowcharts characterizing entire societies or even larger re- gions, replete with arrows from one compartment to the next. Because these systems were rarely in fact simulated, the boxes had to be given names that indicated the direction of change, such as "Population Increase" and "Increased Redistribution of Foodstuffs." What was wrong with this ap- proach - other than the impossibility of morphological change - and why has it gone out of style? Elizabeth Brumfiel (1992, p. 551) has argued that analysis of social change in archaeology was "hampered by ecosystem the- ory's insistence upon whole populations and whole behavioral systems as the units of analysis" (emphasis added), which had the effect of ignoring the "dynamics of social change arising from internal social negotiation." Likewise, Barbara Bender (1990, p. 248) has noted that "the small-time, small-scale actions and interactions of people trying to maintain and en- hance the status quo have their own, often unintended consequences." A related but even more far-reaching conclusion has been advanced by Shen- nan (1991): I would surmise that what regularities there are in social life, and therefore in history and prehistory, are at the level of microscale mechanisms (cf. Elster, 1989; Turner, 1987). Long-term patterns may emerge when particularly stable equilibria develop and result in a process of "chreodisation" (Friedman and Rowlands, 1978; Waddington, 1977).</page><page sequence="39">News from the Northern American Southwest 305 ["Chreod" is a C H. Waddington neologism meant to mean a necessary path, or canalization, for change (Thorn, 1989; Waddington, 1977, pp. 106- 114); the stable equilibria correspond to what complex system theorists call attractors]. In general, then, a focus on individuals, with gender and class identities and interests, who can form coalitions and alliances - in other words, on "agent-centered" rather than "system-centered" models (Brum- fiel, 1992, p. 558)- is essential for understanding social change and cultural evolution. This theoretical impulse finds potential methodological underpinning in an interdisciplinaiy branch of inquiry often referred to as complex adap- tive systems (CAS), which has made progress in developing agent-oriented systems in the last few years [for popular overviews, see Lewin (1992) and Waldrop (1992); for semipopular discussions focusing on particular topics, see Arthur (1990), Holland (1992), and Kauffman (1991); for general thoughts on the sciences of complexity, see Gell-Mann (1992)]. Several ar- eas of overlap between archaeological inquiry and CAS have obvious and immediate applicability, including the idea that global (i.e., high-order) or- ganization can emerge from the interaction of many local entities (e.g., individuals, households) without high-order control and that CAS tend to evolve toward the boundary between order and disorder, more popularly termed the "edge of chaos." This is not the place to lay out a program of CAS research for southwestern archaeology, but the demonstration that villages (in some times and places) probably emerge out of the economic self-interest of households, without the need to invoke the "global control" of a surplus-extracting incipient leader (Köhler and Van West, 1992), is an example of an analytical model that could be examined using one of the computational tools under development in CAS research. Discussion of possible CAS applications in southwestern prehistory is also provided by Upham et al (1991) and Wills et al (1991). Because CAS approaches to date have concentrated on problems of physical and biological evolution (but see Hutchins and Hazelhurst, 1991), anthropologists have an important role to play in bringing "cultural evolution" to such systems. The long-term importance of these approaches may be that we will come to see principles of self-organization to have at least as great a role as selection in forming the structure and dynamics of social systems (Kauffman, 1992). CONCLUSIONS: THE EDGE OF CHAOS AS A (GOOD?) PLACE TO BE For the first half of this century, southwestern archaeology was a dis- cipline in a "periodic" or highly ordered regime [I use this term, as well as</page><page sequence="40">306 Köhler "complex" and "chaotic" following Langton's (1991) descriptions of classes of cellular automata rule space] wherein relatively little change took place in methods, questions, and interpretations. The processual revolt of the 1970s, and the postprocessual backlash of the 1980s, added considerable complexity to the practice of archaeology. If we accept a basic conjecture of much CAS work, that dynamical systems at the critical transition between order and disorder are those capable of the most complex behaviors, in- cluding universal computation (Langton, 1991; but see Mitchell, 1993), then this progression may be useful for our discipline so long as we can avoid stepping into the chaotic regime, wherein no useful work is accomplished. Perhaps the prehistoric cultures of the Southwest likewise moved through highly ordered relatively unchanging states in the long sweeps of the Early and Middle Archaic periods, with gradual increases in complexity (increased numbers of extractive and social roles, increased fluxes of en- ergy, more actors in less mobile conditions - in general, more "computa- tion") beginning in the Late Archaic. By about Pueblo I times, roughly when McGuire sees the appearance of prestige-goods economies, and oth- ers see the inception of regional systems, southwestern societies possibly approached something akin to a "phase transition" in which local societies rapidly became increasingly complex and increasingly interconnected; in- formation and change could be promulgated through systems at this phase transition at unprecedented rates. Some of this interconnection may have been of low archaeological visibility, including intercommunity marriage, intracommunity reciprocity, and regional warfare. Pueblo II-IV times may represent fluctuations around that transition, in which societies explored some of the various possible organizational states near the edge of chaos, until the catastrophe of European contact moved these societies back to- ward a less complex, "periodic" phase in the 1500s. It will be a long time before we understand the dynamics of these transitions in any detail and before we can specify the deeper mechanisms that make such large-scale analogies among physical, biological, and social systems superficially attrac- tive, but it is time to start looking.
