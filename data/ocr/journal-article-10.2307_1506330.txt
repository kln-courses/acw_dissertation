Scott Abstract-Nine fragments of gold wire from pre- Hispanic South America are examined by optical microscopy, metallography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, atomic absorption spectrophotometry and optical emission spectrophotometry. The wires examined include examples of hammered gold wire, block-twisted wire and strip-twisted wire. Cast gold wire, made by the lost-wax process, was commonly employed in both the Muisca and the Sini cultural areas of ancient Colombia. Very fine rectangular gold wire, about 12p by 40j in section, was made in the La Tolita-Tumaco area and an early example is dated to about 325 B.c. This wire may have been made by cutting fine ham- mered gold foil. Apart from the cast examples, all the gold wires examined were made in native gold alloys which are typical for the Colombian-Ecuadorian area. 1 Introduction Gold wire, in its various forms, is a ubiquitous product of both ancient and modern precious metal manufacture and is used in a wide variety of applications, both decorative and functional. There have been several recent publications which deal with the manufacture of wire in the Old World, particularly as a result of the work of Oddy [1, 2] and Ogden [3]. The investigations have shown that there are five essential tech- niques for making wire: hammering, strip- twisting, block-twisting, swaging and drawing. Of these five techniques, drawing-the process of pulling wire through a drawplate made of some hard material-is not thought to have been used before the early mediaeval period, around the sixth century A.D. Although there are some claims made for the use of the drawplate in earlier periods, ranging from the tenth century B.C. to Roman times [4], there is at present no practical evidence to support these claims. Hammered wire in the Old World was being produced in the early Bronze Age; if polished stone or metal tools are available, then it is rela- tively simple to make short pieces of wire, Received 9 March 1990 roughly circular in section, by careful ham- mering. The techniques which involve twisting strands or hammered blocks of gold into wire also date from the Bronze Age, while evidence for the use of a swage block for the manufacture of wire with a D-shaped cross-section occurs around 1200 B.c. [2]. Despite the many studies which have been car- ried out, there is a paucity of data for gold wire from the New World. In this paper, some exam- ples of gold wire from Colombia and Ecuador will be examined from both the compositional and the technological aspect. It is often the case that metallic objects from South America do not have any precise archaeological context: this applies to wire as much as to anything else. Some of the material may be from recognized archae- ological areas which are associated with cultures whose time-span is known from excavations and radiocarbon dating. On this basis an approxi- mate date of manufacture or a time-period of manufacture can be assigned to the objects under study. Most of the wire fragments dis- cussed here were examined in the collections of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York; the Museo del Oro, Bogoti; the Musre de l'Homme, Paris; and the Museum of Mankind, London. 2 Examination and results 2.1 Wire from Colombia The use of gold wire decoration occurs in most, and probably all, of the ancient cultures of this area. Some of the best-known flat gold objects from Colombia, the Muisca tunjos, show the use of cast gold anthropomorphic figures with wire decoration attached. These cast tunjos were votive offerings, often deposited in clay jars, and were not intended for everyday use. Figure I shows a Muisca tunjo from La Calena, Depart- ment of Cundinamarca, Colombia. It was assumed for a long time that the wire decoration of these figures had been soldered or joined to Studies in Conservation 36 (1991) 65-75 65</page><page sequence="2">David A.

In fact, technical examination and optical microscopy have shown that all the detail in these figures was cast integrally by the lost- wax process. The gold wires, therefore, are cast to shape from the wax original and there is no hammering or other working process involved in their fabrication. The Muisca metalwork was in production from about 700 A.D. to 1600 A.D. and the number of surviving pieces of goldwork from Muisca Figure 2 One of a pair of ear ornaments from the Sinzi region of Colombia, measuring about 12cm across, provenance unknown.

Prolific use of cast wire decoration was made in both the Sindi and the Muisca regions of Col- ombia. The Sinfi examples are of 'false filigree' decoration, in which cast wires are used to make small ornaments such as the Sini ear ornament shown in Figure 2, after PNrez de Barradas [5]. Careful modelling in wax is used to make a deli- cate wire ornament, demanding very skilful cast- ing to ensure that the wax model is accurately reproduced. Ear ornaments of this kind are masterpieces of lost-wax casting. In some, evidence for a sprue attachment is suggested at the top of the suspension loop, but there is no other sign of venting. A cross-section through a broken fragment of a Sini ear ornament of the type shown in Figure 2 is reproduced in Figure 3. The section has cut across one particular wire which can be seen towards the top central region of the photo- micrograph. The structure of the ornament is clearly dendritic throughout, with no soldering or joining. The polished section already displays clear evidence of interdendritic segregation and coring as a result of the corrosion that the gold- copper alloy has undergone during burial; in many gold-copper alloys with less than 75 weight percent gold content, corrosion may be very Figure 5 The remnants of two seams folded over at top and bottom of this photomicrograph are evidence of the block-twisting process, in which predominantly two seams result from the twisting, rolling and smoothing of gold wire.

Figure 6 Many gold wires which are block-twisted or hammered reveal only a worked and annealed micro- structure on sectioning. This is partly due to the dificulty of preserving original structure in gold wire which has been worked and annealed, so that details of the process are best seen from surface examination in many instances.

Note the enrichment in gold which has occurred, par- ticularly towards each outer edge of the Sinui ornament in the section shown here. Despite these spectacular examples of the use of cast wire, most ordinary wire from small deco- rative objects or from necklaces is not cast but has been made by one of the working techniques. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the structure of a small piece of wire from the Tairona area of Colombia, from the collections of the Museo del Oro, BogotA (Lab. No. AI27). The later Tairona period is thought to have a similar time-span to that of the Muisca area, from about 800 A.D. to 1600 A.D. [6]. The small loop of wire is 13.6mm in length, with a diameter which varies from 0.51mm to 0.53mm. The wire is carefully roun- ded and at x 20 magnification, using a binocular microscope, two seams can be observed running in a spiral along the length of the wire. The composition of the wire is: gold 73.0%, copper 0.3%, silver 16.7%, iron 0.04%, lead 0.01%, nickel 0.02%, with the following trace elements expressed in parts per million, determined by emission spectroscopy using gold alloy stan- dards and a Hilger and Watts medium quartz spectrograph: aluminium 30ppm, antimony 10ppm, boron 1ppm, manganese 1ppm, sodium lppm, magnesium 5ppm, silicon 300ppm. This analysis is consistent with a native gold alloy from the Colombian region. Much of the gold from this area shows the presence of trace amounts of silicon. Since many of the gold ores are associated with quartz deposits, this is not surprising, and the silicon content may be due to very small quartz inclusions or to some silicon in solid solution with the gold. The silver content is quite high at 16.7%, but many ancient gold objects from the Colombian area show similar amounts, well within the range of natural vari- ation of these native deposits. The analytical results for the wires reported here are given in Table 1. The grain structure of the wire was examined after etching in cyanide/persulphate and was seen to be worked and recrystallized. The hardness of the wire on the Vickers scale is quite low at 60HV-64HV using a 100g loading. The transverse section of the Tairona wire, shown in Figure 5, illustrates the presence of the two seams at opposite sides of the section. The presence of these seams suggests that the wire was made from a hammered strip of gold which was then block-twisted to make the circular sec- tion. The work of Oddy has established that two helical spirals around the circumference of the wire are a typical fabrication line, as a con- sequence of twisting a hammered block of gold which is not perfectly square. It is interesting to note this evidence for the use of the block- twisting technique for the making of wire in the Tairona region. Three fragments of undecorated wire from the Calima area of the Western Cordillera of Colombia (Museo del Oro, Bogota, Lab. Nos. AI55, AI56 and AI61) were available for study. With some of these short fragments, it is not always easy to say exactly how the wires have 68 Studies in Conservation 36 (1991) 65-75</page><page sequence="5">Technical examination of some gold wire from pre-Hispanic South America 1 Cm Figure 7 Fragment of twisted wire (No. AI55) from the Calima area. This piece is one of the few short fragments which gives a clear indication of manu- facturing technique. The seam passing along across the surface of the wire is clearly visible and the end also looks as if it has been made from twisted strip.

In the tech- nique of making wire by strip-twisting, the overall form resembles that of a drinking straw. been made, especially if the outer surfaces have been smoothed so that little indication of any seam or join can be found. The wire which shows the clearest evidence of the way it was made is AI55, illustrated in Figures 7 and 8. This piece is taken from a necklace of beads whose combined weight is 118.18g (Museo del Oro No. 5279). The diameter of this fragment varies between 0.52mm and 0.56mm. Close examination of the suface shows that there are two seams spiralling around the wire, while examination of a polished section shows a gold-rich alloy with a number of voids running along the length. It can be seen that some areas of the wire once consisted of thinner pieces of metal which have now been folded over. Etching in cyanide/persulphate reveals a worked and annealed microstructure consisting of twinned grains with some seams and a long central void. There is good evidence here for the use of the strip-twisting technique in the fabrication of this wire. Analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry found the follow- ing: gold 71.3%, silver 26.8%, with copper, iron, platinum, lead, nickel, antimony and arsenic undetected. The microhardness using a 50g loading was determined between 33HV and 43HV. 1 Cm Figure 9 Fragment of wire (No. AI56) from the Calima area, western Cordillera of Colombia. The diameter of this wire varies between 0.83mm and 0.96mm; it has been cast by the lost-wax process in a native gold alloy. The second Calima wire, AI56, illustrated in Figure 9, is a fragment from a necklace. The wire is circular in cross-section and shows no trace of any seam. Its appearance suggests that the wire has been cast and left in the as-cast state, for slight surface excrescences can be seen period- ically under the microscope at x 20 magni- fication. The wire diameter varies from 0.83mm to 0.96mm. A longitudinal section of the wire shows a sound, gold-rich alloy. By focussing the microscope just below the surface, the outlines of an undistorted dendritic structure can be seen. Very little porosity is observed and there are no visible inclusions or surface enrichment. When the section was etched in cyanide/persulphate the dendritic structure could be seen more clearly, due to the segregation and coring which had taken place in the gold alloy on casting. An estimate of the dendritic arm spacing for this wire gave a value of 33Ct taken over five arms. Atomic absorption analysis found the following composition: gold 84.2%, copper 1.6%, silver 13.7%. The third fragment is a small coil of wire, shown in Figure 10, typically used in the Calima area for the suspension of small beads. The neck- lace from which this piece of wire comes is Museo del Oro No. 6177. The wire has a mean diameter of 0.57mm and it has been carefully made: there is no macroscopic evidence of a seam or twist. A small piece of the loop of wire was cut for metallographic study.

The sec- tion was etched in cyanide/persulphate which revealed the grain structure to be heavily worked, with a number of strain lines as well as twin lines, evidence that the wire has been shaped by cycles of cold-working and annealing. Analysis of this wire found 78.2% gold and 16.1% silver with no copper detected. The microhardness using a 50g loading varied between 43 and 49HV, showing that, despite the presence of strain lines in the microstructure, the wire was not left in a substantially work- hardened condition. This wire was probably made by careful hammering. 2.2 Wire from Ecuador The most famous site for much fine goldwork from Ecuador is the area of La Tolita. This is a coastal site, principally La Tolita island at the mouth of the Santiago river on the Colombian- Ecuadorian border, which produced a consid- erable quantity of fine metalwork between about 300 B.c. and 800 A.D. The finds from the site include a large amount of scrap material or frag- ments for re-working and re-use. One small coil of wire, shown in Figure 11, with diameter varying from 0.38mm to 0-42mm, was studied. The only provenance for this wire given in the records of the National Museum of Denmark (Museum No. 08248A; Lab. No. AI190) is the Department of Esmeraldas, a gen- eral archaeological area which includes the island of La Tolita. The wire must have been carefully finished after manufacture, since there are no indications of any seams on the outer surfaces of the coil. Electron probe analysis shows that the wire is made in a native gold alloy composed of: gold 91.9%, copper 1.3%, silver 6.8%, with no other elements detected over the 0.1% level. In section, this wire shows small longitudinal cracks which suggest that it may have been made by the strip-twisting technique. This technique can result in hollow regions in the body of the wire since, when the strip is twisted round like a paper drinking-straw and hammered and smoothed, some interstices will often remain; indeed, in some Old World wires the spiralling edges of the strip twist are quite evident along the length of the wire. The microhardness was determined to be 73HV-76HV using a 50g load- ing. Figure 11 Small loop of wire (No A1190) from the Department ofEsmeraldas, coastal Ecuador.

Scott sample of the wire for study in the laboratory. The wire is rectangular in section, measuring about 40 by 12p. A scanning electron photo- micrograph of the wire is shown in Figures 12 and 13. A remarkable feature of this wire is the well-controlled thickness of the fragment studied. A closer view of the surface of this wire strip is shown in Figures 14 and 15. The surface appears spongy and porous, suggesting that some surface corrosion and dissolution of the gold wire has occurred in the burial environ- ment. In particular, small circular holes scat- tered over the section suggest the dissolution of grain boundary precipitates, a phenomenon already noted on items of gold jewellery in the collections of the J. Paul Getty Museum [7]. The surface view of the wire shown in Figure 14 illustrates some fine longitudinal striations which, however, are not continuous and are not striations resulting from drawing. They appear rather as superficial marks on the surface from abrasion or damage. At least one edge of the wire appears to be burred over, as can be seen from Figure 14. This may have arisen from a smoothing process in the manufacture of the wire. The enigma of this astonishingly fine gold wire is: how was it made? The composition of this wire is 91% gold, 8% silver, with a trace of copper. The fact that the wire is rectangular in section and only some 124 by 40jt (0.012mm x 0-04mm) suggests that it could have been prepared from a hammered gold foil sheet. If it were possible to cut such a hammered gold sheet into a very thin and continuous rib- bon, then a wire of rectangular section could be produced. The practical difficulties involved in carrying out such a process with the tools which would have been available to the pre-Colombian metalsmith look to be considerable. Gold wire of such fineness would be nearly impossible to make by simply hammering a thin strip of gold to these dimensions: the gold would twist and be liable to break quite easily, and it would be very difficult to achieve such uniform dimensions. One other gold wire of comparable fineness is known, from the archaeological investigations carried out by Jean-Francois Bouchard at the site known as Inguapi, in the region of Tumaco, Department of Narifio, Colombia. Bouchard writes [8] that the piece of wire found during the excavations is 60mm in length and about the thickness of a human hair. This wire also had a rectangular cross-section and microscopic exam- ination showed that the surface contained a number of small irregularities, which would again preclude the use of a drawing technology for the manufacture of this wire. The wire was found in association with a number of ceramic objects, including a small anthropomorphic figure in typical La Tolita style. Radiocarbon dating of this site places it at 2275 -+ 85 B.P. (Ny-642 CNRS:France). This date, of 325 B.c., places the gold wire as one of the earliest dated pieces of goldwork from the area of La Tolita. The Tumaco-La Tolita cultural area crosses the present-day border between Ecuador and Colombia, and in ancient times formed a homogeneous archaeological zone with many closely related traits. The author was able to examine a small frag- ment of this piece of wire from Inguapi and to carry out analysis by electron probe micro- analysis. The wire measures 0.035mm by 0.027mm and is therefore very similar to the example discussed above from the collections of the Museum of the American Indian. Analysis of the Inguapi wire found 88.2% gold, 8.3% silver, with no copper detected. Despite the fact that very few examples of wire of this degree of fineness are known, it is surely significant that the same kind of rectangular-sectioned wire should have been found in Colombia, from Tumaco, and in Ecuador, from La Tolita. They are very closely related culturally and fine wire production may have been one of the specialized features of the area. Among the collection of small fragments of wire from La Tolita in the Museum of the Amer- ican Indian, there are two pieces of twisted gold wire, shown in the scanning electron photo- micrographs of Figures 16 and 17 (Museum No. 1/6485; Lab. Nos. 869A and 869B.) The twisted wire fragment, AI869A, is about 600 in diameter and has been made from hammered gold without any manufacturing seam visible from the surface. The composition of the wire is: gold 98.5%, silver 1% and copper 0.15%. This wire has distinctly flattened surfaces on the roun- ded contours of the spirals, showing that after the spiral was made by twisting, the wire was smoothed and finished to some extent by careful hammering. Slight faceting of the surface is very difficult to avoid when wire is simply hammered to shape. 72 Studies in Conservation 36 (1991) 65-75</page><page sequence="9">Technical examination of some gold wire from pre-Hispanic South America ~r~ ~ '~a~S%;?~ ~i~ k~uc~s~ ;s ii'' ~-~ c~e "1 6~ P ~ .a t ??;? 8 g~ 6~ RI~ a " 'irS~ ~;? ~~~ "~~ -~--??: --C~'?' , ~T" sg ;-?

Practically every known piece of authentic Colombian goldwork which is cast, has been cast by the direct lost-wax process. The use of indirect lost-wax casting in this area is very rare. Each wire, therefore, is cast after a fine wax wire original model. The use of simple, careful hammering to make gold wire was a common manufacturing tech- nique, but there is evidence for the existence of the block-twisting technique and, probably, the strip-twisting technique. Certainly hammering was used to produce twisted wire which was then carefully shaped by further cold-working. The manufacture of fine wire in the La Tolita- Tumaco area has been examined, although it is difficult to reconstruct from the evidence adduced during this study exactly how the Indian metalsmiths produced this tour deforce. Studies in Conservation 36 (1991) 65-75 73</page><page sequence="10">David A. Scott One possibility is that the wire was made from cut strips of hammered gold foil. The time-period for the manufacture of wire, ranging in the case of the fragments studied here from about 325 B.c. up to the period before the Spanish Conquest in the fifteenth century A.D., is a very long one. Many more examples of South American wire need to be studied before a clear chronology of techniques can be established. The probable pre-eminence of wire made by sim- ple hammering and the lack of easily datable contexts may mean that progress in the tech- nological characterization of South American gold wire will be slow. The use of the same, or similar, techniques for the manufacture of wire in the New World as compared with the Old need not be problematic. The careful observation and manipulation of gold by ancient craftsmen could explain why technological processes are often the same, with- out postulating the transmission of knowledge by diffusion. With the materials and techniques available, there is a finite number of solutions to the problem of making wire before the intro- duction of the drawplate.

Zusammenfassung-Neun Fragmente siidameri- kanischer Golddrfihte aus der Zeit vor der spanischen Eroberung werden mit Hilfe der Lichtmikroskopie, der Metallographie, der Rasterelektronenmikro- skopie, der Mikrosonde, der Atomabsorptions- spektrophotometrie und der optischen Emissions- spektralanalyse untersucht. Unter den untersuchten, Drfihten gibt es Beispiele fuir gehlimmerte, zwischen Steinen gerollten und fiir aus Streifen gedrehten Gold- drihte. Im alten Kolumbien (Gebiete der Muisca und Sinu Kulturen) finden sich hiufig nach dem Wachsausschmelzverfahren gegossene Drfihte. Sehr feine, im Querschnit rechteckige (circa 12 mal 40 Mikrometer) Golddrdihte wurden im Gebiet von La Tolita-Tumaco hergestallt: Eine friihes Beispiel ist datiert auf circa 325 v. Chr. Dieser Draht wurde mdglicherweise durch Schneiden eines diinn gehitm- merten Goldbleches gefertigt. Bis auf die gegossenen Drfihte wurden alle anderen untersuchten Dr~ihte aus gediegenen Goldlegierungen gemacht, die typisch flir das kulumbianisch-equadorianische Gebiet sind.
