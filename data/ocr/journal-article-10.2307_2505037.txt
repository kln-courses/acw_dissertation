<plain_text><page sequence="1">ThE GENESIS OF THE COPERNICAN WORLD. By Hans Blumenberg. Translated by Robert M. Wallace. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987. Pp. xlviii, 772. This is the third massive volume by Hans Blumenberg to appear in English trans- lation (all by R. M. Wallace) in recent years, the previous two having been The Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1983) and Work on Myth (1985). Wallace deserves great credit not only for undertaking the translations, but also for his introduc- tions to the three volumes, which provide distinct help in easing the reader into this important but often difficult and complex body of work. The three volumes are deeply related, both methodologically and in the con- clusions offered; many topics that are only hinted at or dealt with cursorily in one volume are developed in detail in another. Blumenberg's fundamental con- cern is with the "history of consciousness." By "consciousness" he means, roughly, an epoch's conception of itself, of the context in which it exists, and of its history and goals. (The concept of an "epoch" used in The Genesis of the Copernican World is examined more fully in Legitimacy.') In all three books, Blumenberg seeks to understand the emergence of an epoch's self-consciousness through at- tempts to deal with problems faced by an earlier epoch, either in its confronta- tions with the immediately surrounding world (an aspect emphasized heavily in Work on Myth) or with basic human needs, or with the tensions in that epoch's views of the world (the major focus in Legitimacy and the work under review). Thus, in Work on Myth, the roots of both reason and myth are located in hu- manity's having come "close to not having control of the conditions of [its] exis- tence," and, more importantly, to its having believed that it "simply lacks control of them"2-a condition Blumenberg traces, in that book, to the emergence of early human species from the forest into the open savannah. The Legitimacy of the Modern Age analyzes various facets of the questions of the nature, roots, and uniqueness of "modernity," the self-consciousness of the present epoch. The book under review here stands between the other two, in filling in what Blumenberg sees as a crucial step in the transition from earlier thought to the development of modern consciousness. Here he is concerned with a particular 1. Hans Blumenberg, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age [19661, transl. R. M. Wallace (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1983), part IV, chapter 1. 2.

As always, Blumenberg's interest is in showing "how what was impossible, intolerable, and systematically excluded at some ear- lier time was even able to get within the radius of the attainable, of what people could consider" (131). Although Blumenberg is concerned to show what made possible the rise of the conception of human self-assertiveness, he centers in this book still more closely on one aspect of this characteristic, one which he sees as having emerged from the work of Copernicus. He views the primary contribution of Copernicus to the development of modern consciousness neither in the greater observational accuracy of the Copernican astronomical system (a point with which most modern scholars would agree), nor in its theological acceptability or unacceptability, nor even in its replacement of a geocentric with a heliocentric cosmology. Rather, in Blumenberg's view, "The important thing for Copernicus, in his changes in the world-system, was to register reason's claim to truth" (262). In this regard, the pivotal element of Copernicus's contribution lay in his conception of the heavens as standing still; for in that doctrine, what had seemed to be true on the basis of sensory experience, the daily revolution of the heavens around us, was shown to be mere appearance, the truth of the matter lying behind the de- ceptive indications of sensory "intuition." Contrary to tradition, according to which truth about the heavens is hidden from us (only a "saving of phenomena" independent of any physics of structure or dynamics being possible), Copernicus's achievement made human beings capable of finding truth even in the celestial region. In this accomplishment, Copernicanism provided an important ingre- dient in what would become the modern image of human self-assertion. What need to be analyzed, according to Blumenberg, are not only the condi- tions that made it possible for Copernicus himself to have considered such a view seriously, but also those that made people ready to take it seriously - "a change in people's readiness to receive such a proposal" (143). The consciousness of one epoch makes certain patterns of thought "impossible, intolerable, and systemati- cally excluded" (131). "Such systems are not primarily aimed at leaving lacunae for possibilities, but rather precisely at shutting down the motives for laying claim to heterogeneous, extrasystematic potentials" (132). Thus, in particular, "A Coper- nicus of the thirteenth century would not have been able to break through the internal consistency and stability of this connected system" (141). It is with "the removal of hindrances to mental operations" that Blumenberg is primarily con- cerned. "To me," he explains, "the exciting historical problem of this epochal turning is precisely not the explanation of the fact of Copernicus's accomplish- ment, or even the affirmation of its necessity, but rather finding the basis of its mere possibility" (167). Blumenberg rejects the idea that conditions making possible a new way of thought arise out of the rebellion of "emancipators" against the prevailing con- sciousness. For him, "historical experience seems rather to tend to allow systems</page><page sequence="3">226 REVIEW ESSAYS to decay of their own accord, as a result of their internal contradictoriness and their lack of elasticity in the face of unmastered reality" (132). It was thus "the liquidation of this [Scholastic] system from within-and that must mean pre- cisely from the center of its theological motivations -that turned the impossi- bility of a medieval Copernicus into his possibility" (143). More specifically, the process was one of "the opening up of a latitude as the result of loosening of the systematic structure - as a result of the accenting of specific theological prop- ositions" (143). What, then, were the problems lying at "the center of its theological motivations," with which the Medieval epoch was trying to deal, and how did the answers it gave to those problems come to be loosened to the extent that latitude was opened that could make a Copernicus possible? According to Blumenberg, the problems of the Medieval epoch stemmed ultimately from a conflict between the concep- tion of God as responsible for creation and God as responsible for salvation, a problem he puts most strikingly in Legitimacy (135) as that of how "to hold the God of creation and the God of salvation together in one system" - of "How the perfection of the first act could allow the second act's desperate intervention to become necessary" (70). (The author traces this problem still further to the question of "whether at the moment the sacrament was administered the power operating in the instrument derived directly from God or whether it was to be regarded as a capacity for operation that was deposited in it" [155-156].) The Gnostic solution was to suppose a different god for each function; but Chris- tianity, accenting the proposition of the omnipotence of God, took the route of having the same god for both. Yet the doctrine of God's omnipotence -what Blumenberg calls "theological absolutism" - did not solve the problem, for it left God with the responsibility for corruption. (The problem is thus, at root, Blumen- berg's version of the problem of the existence of evil and its apparent incompati- bility with an all-powerful and absolutely good God.) The major Medieval solu- tion to that problem in turn was to transfer the responsibility for corruption to human beings. That did not solve the problem either, however, especially when human beings were deemed unable to do anything that would earn them grace, which an omnipotent and thus unconstrained God doled out to only a few. Human beings were left powerless; Gnosticism had arisen once again, in a new form, and would have to be confronted. (As Scholasticism was "a sum of positions established against the threat of Gnosticism" [467], so, in Legitimacy [137 and elsewhere], the modern era is seen as "the second overcoming of Gnosticism.") Ironically, it was the doctrine of omnipotence itself which opened the door to the possibility of new ways of meeting the problem, through the Paris decree of 1277 proscribing any doctrines that limited God's powers. Far from being merely a proscription, that decree freed God from any constraints dictated by Aristotelian reason, and so opened to late Medieval thinkers the "latitude" to consider possi- bilities not permitted in the Aristotelian scheme. The "epochal crisis of the Middle Ages" (200) could now be met, in different ways, by Nominalism on the one hand and Humanism on the other. Each of these responses would contribute toward</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ESSAYS 227 shaping a consciousness that would be prepared to make Copernican ideas (and, ultimately, modernity) seem at least possible. Thus specific Nominalist doctrines, such as that of appetites partium, the desire of parts to cohere as a whole, and those of the impetus theory - made it possible to deny the absolute Aristotelian- Scholastic epistemological and ontological difference between the heavens and the terrestrial regions, and to suggest the possibility of the earth's motion. Nevertheless, Nominalism could not, according to Blumenberg, have produced a Copernicus. For the aim of such Nominalist arguments was not to replace the Medieval perspective, but to preserve it. In particular, their arguments were directed toward demonstrating God's sovereignty, his omnipotence. The case was similar with Humanism. Whereas the High Medieval viewpoint was theocentric rather than anthropocentric, Humanism confronted the problem of corruption, and the consequent assertion of the necessity of human misery, by postulating that the universe was made for human beings, an idea that Blumen- berg argues is central to the Copernican contribution to the development of moder- nity. But Humanism also could not by itself have produced a Copernicus, be- cause it could not meet the skeptical arguments advanced by Nominalism against the possibility of finding truth. (Thus, for Blumenberg, Humanism is, in this respect at least, a later Medieval doctrine, spawned along with Nominalism by the rejuvenated Gnostic problem.) The revival of Stoicism in the Renaissance, primarily through the reading of Cicero, was important for Humanist doctrines; but it also was involved with a third ingredient in making Copernicanism possible. It was not until Stoicism, according to Blumenberg, that an anthropocentric cosmos was introduced in an- cient times; the Platonic-Aristotelian philosophies saw control of the cosmos as exercised from an outward to an inward direction - for Plato by the Forms, and for Aristotle by the motion of the outermost sphere, rotating for love of the im- mobile Prime Mover. (That was one of the doctrines that would have precluded the possibility of a Copernicus before his time, for "The provision of the world's continual 'energy requirements' from the outside inward, by way of the medi- ating agency of the heavenly spheres and all the way down to the terrestrial processes of coming to be and ceasing to be, would have been incompatible with the Copernican implication that the primary motion of the heavens and the path of the Sun were illusory" [141].) Stoicism for the first time put the emphasis on the center, and in particular on its chief occupants, human beings: the center was the place, both honorifically and in order to contemplate the universe pas- sively, at which Humanity ought to be located. But Stoicism had thus equated anthropocentrism with geocentrism, and thus could not itself have produced Copernicanism. (Indeed, as Blumenberg points out, it was the Stoics who ac- cused Aristarchus, ancient proponent of a sun-centered cosmology, of impiety). Their association of the two, in Blumenberg's analysis, was a product of the Greek view that the world really is as it appears to plain vision. Not only the Medieval idea of a God whose purposes and means are hidden, but also the Nominalist ideas of the possibility of His using means which contradict what seems to be the case, stripped vision of its unchallenged primacy. Thus the neo-Stoic, Hu-</page><page sequence="5">228 REVIEW ESSAYS manist doctrine that the universe was made for Humanity did not require that Humanity should be located at the center; importance did not necessarily imply occupation of the physically central position. In the light of this background, Blumenberg takes seriously a statement of Copernicus's which most other writers have dismissed, about "the movements of the world machine" having been "created for our sake by the best and most systematic Artisan of all."3 With this Humanist doctrine, now divorced from the geocentric associations of its Stoic origins, and fortified by Nominalist skepti- cism about what Aristotelian reason and human vision insisted must be the case, it became possible for both Copernicus and his audience to consider the Coper- nican alternative. The way having been paved for taking his doctrine seriously, Copernicus could deny the traditional bifurcation of heavens and earth, and could assert the homogeneity of the universe, so that what applied to the heavens could also apply to the earth, and vice versa. (His denial of bifurcation is one reason why, in Blumenberg's view, many writers are incorrect in considering Copernicus a "Platonist.") With that homogeneity, he could assert for his astronomical system a truth that was attainable by man, and furthermore was attainable despite that truth's contradiction of the evidence of the senses; to beings for whom every- thing was made, the power of attaining such truth, even when it was "hidden" from the senses, could not be denied. "The claim to truth did not help Coper- nicus's system to become accepted any more than it was able to add even a jot to the honor accorded to Copernicus in the history of science. But the epochal 'energy' that was set free by Copernicus was, nevertheless, due only to it" (262). It is for this reason that "for the modern age Copernicus is less a figure in the history of science than a figure in the history of consciousness" (312), "a central theme for the self-definition of a new consciousness" (313). His primary contribu- tion was an important ingredient of modern "self-assertiveness." Blumenberg sees that contribution as accompanied by an alteration of the concept of "theory," an alteration also destined to take its place in modern consciousness: "'theory' in a new sense, at the end of which man is a match for any object" (20); theory as concerned with what lies behind appearances, and as something that must be worked for, through probing experiment and quantitative analysis, rather than as the passive result of visual contemplation, as it was for the ancients. What made the Copernican proposal possible, then, was "an already existing freedom, which the late Middle Ages had in fact themselves achieved, in the logic of their internal discussions and the working out of their systematic tensions, and had put into effect despite concern about their own stability (and, not least of all, on account of that concern)" (168). Thus the conditions making that de- velopment possible were already well under way independently of Copernicus; nor did they all simply converge on Copernicus, but had other effects on the de- velopment of modern consciousness, helping to shape later responses to Coper- nicanism itself. In one important respect, too, Copernicus himself was not modern, being a "transitional episode" along that path: "Copernicus had still not believed 3. Nicholas Copernicus, On the Revolutions, transl. Edward Rosen (London, 1978), II, 4.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ESSAYS 229 that the truth about the world, which he sought, could exist without the world's having been arranged for man's benefit by a providential reason" (89). The aban- donment of that "anthropomorphic teleology" is clear in Descartes, and, for Blumenberg, "This nonneediness is the real difference between the modern age's rationality and Copernicus, a difference that makes his claim to truth, and what that claim presupposed, obsolete, and excludes it, as a transitional episode, from being part of the epoch" (315). Although the analysis I have summarized thus far constitutes the core of the book, those topics do not by any means exhaust those dealt with in the book. I will only call attention to two other major ones. Having provided this study of the roots and nature of the Copernican achievement, Blumenberg offers (part II, chapter 6) an account of the sequence of reasoning by which Copernicus ar- rived at his theory. The reconstruction is, Blumenberg admits, hypothetical; but what gives it special interest is the fact that it is made not only on the basis of the rather thin textual evidence available, but also on the way in which it is put together in the light of Blumenberg's general interpretation of the roots and na- ture of the Copernican achievement. A second subject of major importance is examined in part IV: the changes brought about through Copernicanism in the concept of time, and how those changes have affected modern perspectives. This is a topic that has been largely ignored by scholars, who have been prone to con- centrate on the changes brought about by that development in the concept of space and our location in it. Blumenberg presents a compelling case for attrib- uting to the alterations in the concept of time - given its association by the Greeks with a motion of the stellar sphere which was now reduced to a mere appearance - a role which is at least as important in the transition to modern consciousness. As he traces the Copernican achievement backward to its roots in Medieval and Greek thought, so Blumenberg probes the spectrum of responses to it. The range of that spectrum reflects "how ambiguous the effect of Copernicanism on human self-consciousness was, since it could just as well be the humiliation of losing the central position as the triumph of the reason that penetrated foreground appearances" (81). The range of Blumenberg's analyses is again too wide to sum- marize here. Two examples can at least convey something of the flavor of his interpretations. The Enlightenment is seen as having thought "that it could pre- serve the universe's teleological character, after abandoning anthropocentrism, only by letting the whole universe be inhabited by rational creatures" (85). Idealism is portrayed as "dealing with the Copernican disillusionment by revealing it as a condition of the possibility of a new self-consciousness that pushes its eccen- tric position outward until it becomes an exterior one" (74). Among the other major post-Copernican figures who receive penetrating analyses are Rheticus, Melanchthon, Bruno, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Kant, Lambert, Schelling, Goethe, Heine, Feuerbach, Humboldt, Nietzsche, and a host of others -most of them given close textual examination. Though Blumenberg cites some historians of science, he seems unaware of much contemporary work in that field. For example, in ignorance of their conscien-</page><page sequence="7">230 REVIEW ESSAYS tious and often successful efforts to avoid "Whiggish" interpretations of the his- tory of science, he repeatedly charges them with having "made the present; and thus the final state of science at each present moment, into the legitimizing point on which all the efforts that preceded it converge" (230). With his close examina- tion of sources, he does not suffer overly much from the error; indeed, historians of science have much to learn from him. He often provides correctives for common misunderstandings, as in his illuminating discussion of the motivations and ac- complishments of Franciscus de Marchia and John Buridan, and in his brilliant assessment of the meaning of Kant's self-styled "Copernican turning" in philos- ophy. Where his analyses overlap those of modern historians of science, he is often more illuminating, or at least more suggestive, more thought-provoking, than what is to be found in their writings. Consider two examples. Many historians of science have, like Blumenberg, seen the fourteenth-century impetus theorists not as advocating doctrinal alternatives to those of Aristotle, but merely as con- tending that the alternatives they presented were equally as plausible as those argued for by him; reason could not establish the claims of either side. Those historians thus set the fourteenth-century arguments in the context of a "Faith versus Reason" reaction against thirteenth-century Aristotelianism. Blumenberg, too, sees the impetus theorists partly in that light - but only partly; for his treat- ment puts their views into a far larger and more illuminating context than that. It is an aspect of a broader and more important history, going deep into the foun- dations of the Christian theology of divine omnipotence, itself a response to threats, itself containing its own tensions and latitudes, and itself growing from a yet older history. As a second example, even Pierre Duhem, who like Blumen- berg emphasized the importance of the Paris decree of 1277 to the development of modern science, did not put that pronouncement into such a setting as this, one which illuminates not only the history of science but is also suggestive as to the broader nature of modernity, and of the human condition itself. The scholarship is vast, the care lavished on textual evidence worthy of high respect, the scope and richness of the analyses frequently profound. With such a wide domain, however, there are bound to be errors or questionable emphases of various degrees of seriousness. The following are a few examples. Fitting Plato into the interpretation of the Greeks as having believed that reality is as it ap- pears to the senses requires more careful elaboration than I find Blumenberg offering. The case can be made, however; for even though, according to Plato, reality is something other than what is given to the senses, nevertheless the con- stituents of that reality, the Forms, are in all cases similar to what is given in sense-experience -the constituents of the latter being imitations of (or "par- ticipants in") those of the former. In this way, Plato too can be seen, along with many other Greek thinkers, in opposition to the view of reality proffered by modern physics. Blumenberg makes much of Copernicus's having "deduced from the shape of the Earth's shadow in eclipses of the Moon that the Earth is precisely spher- ical" (675); but the discovery was not uniquely Copernican, Aristotle having used the same argument to show that the earth is round. On several occasions, Blumen- berg refers to Ptolemaic orderings of the planets and estimates of their distances</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW ESSAYS 231 from earth; but he never mentions the fact, so crucial in convincing such people as Kepler of the truth (if not merely of the possibility) of Copernicanism, that the order and relative distances of the planets are deducible from the geometry of the Copernican system, but not from that of the Ptolemaic. Given Galileo's extensive arguments in the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems against traditional arguments purporting to show the impossibility of the earth's motion, it seems strange to assert that, while "what was at issue [with regard to the Copernican system in the early seventeenth century] was . . .. the securing of its mere possibility by eliminating the classical objections . . . Galileo did not perceive the Copernican theory's need for this type of help" (393). It is also mis- leading to claim that "The main topic of the Fourth Day did not fit into the book's argumentation, which in its form obeyed the instruction of 1616" (421), since it is at least arguable (and was argued by Galileo's critics) that the rest of the book obeys those instructions in form only. Kant was not "the first to be able to interpret 'realistically' the force of attraction that Newton had introduced" (303); Roger Cotes, as one example among many, had already done so. It is sur- prising to read that "Oresme ignored the impetus, in spite of its importance for the whole Parisian Ockhamist school" (159). Impetus certainly played an impor- tant role in Oresme's thought.4 Blumenberg tends too much to see Newton, gravi- tation, and inertia as having been the physics required to support the Coper- nican system, as though the system cried out from its beginning for that particular physics (see 128, 394). Correspondingly, it is wrong to claim (part III, chapter 6) that Copernicus and Galileo avoided offering a physical theory to bolster the Copernican system; on the contrary, they did so, as did Kepler, Descartes, and others. A more accurate assessment of the historical situation would be that, while it needed a physics, it was the Newtonian that turned out to be the one that supported it successfully. No doubt experts in the many subjects into which Blumenberg enters will find their own further points to quarrel with. But there are more fundamental issues about Blumenberg's approach and views than such slips and questions of in- terpretation. Let us turn to some of these. Two separate grounds might be cited for accusing Blumenberg of being simplistic. Some will argue that seeing "epochs" as being characterizable in terms of a "con- sciousness" is too monolithic, as too much in the discredited tradition of the Wel- tanschauung or the Zeitgeist. Such a criticism would itself, I think, be simplistic. Blumenberg is careful to portray, in depth, a great variety of ideas in each epoch he considers. What that range has in common is not a set of doctrines, but prob- lems, shaped by history and by human needs and circumstances. The variety of doctrines held constitute an age's different ways of responding to those prob- lems, and if there are common themes (as in "modernity") in response to those fundamental problems, those themes raise further problems leading to wide vari- 4. See the texts and commentary in Marshall Clagett, The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages (Madison, Wisc., 1959), for example, 552.</page><page sequence="9">232 REVIEW ESSAYS ations on themselves. (Readers should also be reminded that the concept of an "epoch" itself has not escaped his close scrutiny.) In addition to grounding - together with common themes - the unity of an epoch, such problems, rather than common doctrines, also give continuity to the historical transitions from one epochal consciousness to another. (Thus Blumenberg is not subject to the charge of relativism to which Thomas Kuhn's idea of "incommensurable paradigms" gave rise.) Nevertheless, one must ask whether Blumenberg has deserted his usual deeply historical perspective in sup- posing, simplistically, the existence of problems that transcend history, that are common to all epochs. In particular, are those problems which are set by human needs simply brute givens, not subject to change in the light of historical de- velopments? (And are we forever fated, whatever our beliefs about the world, scientific or otherwise in any epoch, to make compensating adjustments to meet some set of unalterable needs?) The idea that there are permanent and unalter- able human needs, with respect to which "reoccupations," "differing answers to the same questions," must continually appear, is at the very least in need of careful reconsideration. One might be willing to agree that certain fundamental biolog- ical needs set "problems" which have remained more or less constant throughout history; but even in the case of such needs, is it not misleading to see the relevant history as having been a succession of different ways of responding to exactly the same needs? For new cultural and social conditions (including, among other things, scientifically-based technology) have led to reconceptions, and therefore alterations, even of such needs themselves. And in any case, beyond some such set of "biological" needs, does the sort of "need" on which Blumenberg focuses so heavily, that of human beings for security, for self-esteem, for having some importance in the universe, have even that degree of permanence? Must we not, for a fuller historical understanding, see even needs as undergoing at least some degree of change, and in some cases perhaps even abandonment, in the light of new circumstances? As a second basis for charging Blumenberg with being too simplistic, some critics will see him as being overly concerned with ideas (in a broad sense that includes, among other things, science, philosophy, and theology), to the exclu- sion of economic, social, political, and other nonintellectual factors. Indeed, many historians of science today have gone to the opposite extreme, turning away from consideration of ideas - even of the ideas which are central to science - to an almost exclusive concentration on institutions, national styles, and the like. Blumenberg is certainly not sympathetic toward such an approach; he is fully aware of the need to consider the substantive content of scientific ideas. In his own terms, the problem is rather the reverse: it is not simply whether more nonin- tellectual considerations need to be included in the study of the history of science, but, rather, whether there must come a point at which even many of the intellec- tual factors that Blumenberg's analyses do incorporate will have to be excluded from an historical study of science, as being external and irrelevant, at least to the reasoning that takes place in science. The issue of whether Blumenberg's his- torical methodology omits too much or, after a certain stage, includes too much,</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ESSAYS 233 leads to what I take to be the most fundamental problem in his approach, and indeed in the whole issue of the relation between the history of science and other sorts of history. The great merit of Blumenberg's work lies in his attempt to see how the possi- bility of new ideas, inconceivable from the viewpoint of a given epoch, could have arisen from the tensions and loosenings of those very prior human concep- tions, and to show that the historical sequence of the rise of new possibilities could ultimately lead to "modernity." And in the other temporal direction, his ultimate aim is to show how that sequence of possibilities has emerged not from revelation or a priori reasoning or the plain and simple evidence of the senses, but from human conditions themselves, and in their most ultimate roots, as in Work on Myth, from the most primitive ones. Since he is concerned with ideas as responses to problems, the methodology involved in his historical tracings is to consider ideas in their intellectual context (in a broad sense): no one aspect of that intellectual context - such as science - is to take priority over any others. Rather, we must observe "Historical respect for the equal rank of the aids that man avails himself of in comprehending the world" (171). "History is precisely the theoretical attitude that allows us to do this" (172). It is a corollary that "the absolutism of whatever happens to be the present [is] precisely the kind of superstition - making itself into the center - the destruction of which will always be the business of the theory of history" (124). And yet, in a passage that, in the light of these characterizations of his ap- proach, is remarkable, he suggests that there is, or should be, something about the history of science, at least after a certain point, that is different from other sorts of history, including his own. Science has not only reached an overwhelming tumescence, quantitatively; it has also changed its overall state qualitatively. If one were permitted to put it this way, I would describe it as having "less and less history," or being less and less historical. Since the nineteenth century the tendency of the development of problems at least in the natural sciences is more and more subject to an immanent lawfulness of the individual disciplines and of their influence, dependence, and overlapping on one another in a compound that in its turn is also immanently regulated. The more rigorously this inner logic of the un- folding of a theoretical totality is developed, and the more dependent the acute questions at any time are upon the results already arrived at, the less the course of the theoretical process can be influenced by heterogeneous conditioning factors and the less important that background of more general prior assumptions and that free space of the possible become.... It is not difficult to foresee that the history of science in the twentieth cen- tury, if it ever can be and ever is written, will have to be of a very different type from that of, for example, the seventeenth century: It will have to dissect out the institutional- ized dynamic of the theoretical events and establish the impotence of all external motives, and of everything in the "background," in contrast to that iron logic. (132-133) Blumenberg is well aware of the problem this raises for the methodology of the history of science. Having given history the job of destroying the chauvinism of an age, he again and again confesses, but always only in passing, that "His- tory of science is the specific form of history that makes it especially difficult for us" (172), because of "preponderance of internal logic over determinability</page><page sequence="11">234 REVIEW ESSAYS by external influences" (134) which is the character ultimately achieved by ma- ture science. That is when the history of science must be written, in Blumen- berg's own view, differently from the way he himself has written it. But at what point should the history of science begin to be written separately, and how is it to be related to other aspects of human history, both intellectual and nonin- tellectual? Though he has raised the problem, Blumenberg offers us no guidance as to its solution. The problem needs to be faced. Many contemporary historians of science notwithstanding, it seems to me, as it does to Blumenberg, that one cannot look closely at the development of science without realizing that, in at least some aspects of its "logic," science develops independently of "external" influences. Whatever the latter sorts of influences may be, and whatever the strength of the pressures they exert, there are reasons for building a supercollider which are to be found solely within the substantive content of particle physics and the as- sociated technology, reasons which are not shaped, in their fundamental charac- teristics, by factors external to that content; and, further, those reasons have reasons behind them which likewise lie solely within the content of prior physics. Finally, it is clear that the degree to which various areas of science have achieved such autonomy has increased markedly since the days when scientific thought relied (and in the absence of more to go on, had to rely largely) on philosophical, theological, and other sorts of Blumenbergian considerations that have since been distinguished - externalized -from the scientific process. Roughly sketched, a major historical process that we need to understand is that through which the possibility of such independent development has itself emerged, gradually and in some cases only incompletely, from the kinds of situations and problems Blumenberg examines; how certain factors important in its emergence have come to be dropped out as scientifically irrelevant, as "external" to scientific reasoning; and how the development of such reasoning proceeds independently from there on, insofar as it does.5 That gradual process involves Blumenberg-like processes of the opening of possibilities, but also factors which, as I pointed out earlier in the case of Kepler's adoption of Copernicanism, Blumenberg sometimes ig- nores: ones leading to the actual acceptance of scientific ideas, and which then come to be employed as "internal" considerations leading on to further scientific ideas. It is not that there is "less and less history" of science, as Blumenberg sug- gests; it is just that the history of science comes to proceed by additional and sometimes by other means. Such history need not involve an uncritical "anthropomorphism in time" (124) which takes science (much less present science) as sacrosanct, and sees the thoughts of the past merely as leading up to those of the present. Nor need it reject the importance of other sorts of factors, intellectual and nonintellectual, for a fuller comprehension of history and its epochs, including our own. We need not deny or ignore, for example, the fact that choices from among scientifically-reasoned 5.

But the importance of such factors does not negate the importance of ideas in Blumenberg's broad sense, or of scientific ideas, which require their own his- torical treatment even if that treatment needs later to be integrated with (though not abandoned in favor of) that of other factors. (Indeed, too many of today's histories, even histories of science, err in the opposite direction: studies made in the name of completeness all too often tend to reduce scientific and other in- tellectual factors to being mere outgrowths of economic, social, or institutional ones, and thus to ignore or deny any independent historical importance they may have.) Portrayal of the emergence, from earlier Blumenberg-like contexts and prob- lems, of the possibility of reasoning "internal" to science, of the acceptance - however tentative - of certain results as guiding principles in that reasoning, and of the non-Whiggish ways in which that reasoning proceeds and evolves further, is a sound and important object for historical investigation. It is a project envi- sioned in a Blumenbergian spirit, but extending that spirit to deal with the inter- nalization of scientific reasoning whose historical existence Blumenberg himself recognizes, though he fails to give an account of it, either with regard to its processes or to the historical methodology appropriate for its study. More is at issue than just a matter of how history should be written. For what is at stake is our understanding of how we have come to think as we do about the universe in which we live, about our place in it, about what understanding that universe and ourselves consists in, and about what values to hold. It is an historical fact, with which the historian must deal like anyone else, that science has become ever more important in the rejecting of old conceptions (and even values), and that it lays down constraints to which other beliefs must ultimately adjust. For the purpose of understanding and assessing its immense importance in these connections, "equal rank" can no longer be assigned, after a certain point in the history of a science, to all "aids that man avails himself of in compre- hending the world" and in responding to whatever "needs" or "problems" human beings must face. (Incidentally, this brings us back to an earlier question: if science does arrive at conclusions of such import, however tentative they may be, per- haps our "needs" must come to terms with those conclusions, rather than simply seeking refuge in compensating reoccupations.) These points bring out starkly both the very great importance of Blumenberg's work and the limitations of its conclusions and the conception of historical meth- odology by which those conclusions have been attained. Whatever one may say in criticism of Blumenberg's particular analyses, his approach itself is one that is legitimate and needed. He seeks the rise of ideas in human history and the problems confronted therein; it is an error of both superstition and philosophy to suppose that the roots of any ideas can be found elsewhere. But Blumenberg has not fully thought out the consequences of his position concerning the his- tory of science, and thus has failed to come to terms with the full importance of science in the modern world. This failure has adverse effects on (or perhaps</page><page sequence="13">236 REVIEW ESSAYS is the adverse result of) his views of the nature and aims of science itself, which are presented only as asides, ex cathedra. For example, he asserts that "In the history of science, the attempt to grasp the truth of the world as a whole . . . is only an episode, which was to be deprived of its basis by the consequences of this undertaking itself" (312). Yet that undefended antirealist philosophy of science is highly debatable, to say the least. Controversy about whether science seeks and finds truth has continued over the centuries, and there are many distin- guished scientists today who believe, with considerable reason, that we are now approaching a comprehensive truth about the universe and its evolution, a "Theory of Everything." On another occasion Blumenberg declares that the concept of inertia is "the classic case of an assertion that, as such, could never. be demon- strated by observation or experiment, with whatever equipment" (394). Such a view, quite common two or three decades ago, is indefensible if we do not require (as Blumenberg himself does not) that "evidence" provide an absolutely conclu- sive "demonstration": evidence can be adduced for and against even such very general scientific principles. (A hockey puck travels further, and with less de- celeration, on some surfaces than on others. Phenomena of these sorts and others, while they are not, in the narrowest sense of direct perception of the motion of bodies free of all external forces, "direct evidence" for the principle of inertia, nevertheless provide an empirical basis for extrapolation to the case in which there is no resistance at all.) Blumenberg has thus left us with deep and disturbing problems about the ways in which science is to be understood, and how its history is to be written, espe- cially once it has achieved a certain (but unspecified) stage of maturity. The prob- lems are not, I have suggested, insurmountable: a consistent picture of the rela- tions of history of science to the sort of history Blumenberg has given us can be drawn, even if Blumenberg himself has not drawn it; and that consistent pic- ture can be extended to the sorts of history that focus on yet broader ranges of factors than Blumenberg considers. But in any case, these limitations of his anal- yses, and whatever other doubts or disagreements one may have about the specifics of his interpretations and methods, cannot diminish the fact that his profound and provoking studies, in this book and in his monumental trilogy as a whole, are a major contribution to our understanding of the intellectual factors from which modern science, and much of modern "consciousness," have emerged.
