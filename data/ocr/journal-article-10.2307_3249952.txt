<plain_text><page sequence="1">JULIA K. MURRAY ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE LIFE OF CONFUCIUS: THEIR EVOLUTION, FUNCTIONS, AND SIGNIFICANCE IN LATE MING CHINA The late Ming period saw the appearance of numerous pictorial biographies or hagiographies of Confucius (ca. 551-479 B.C.), the great Eastern Zhou philosopher and teacher. Many sets of annotated pictures, usually bearing some form of the title Shengji tu (Pictures of the Sage's Traces), were created to portray a comprehensive series of events and anecdotes associated with Confucius's life, arranged in roughly chronological order. Illustrations of the subject were far more common in printed or carved media than in painting, and the majority of examples were woodblock prints bound into books. The few painted illustrations that survive were based on printed models, contrary to the dominant direction of influence between the two media. As the theme evolved during the middle and late Ming period (late ISth-mid 17th centuries), the number of biographical episodes illustrated steadily increased, from between twenty-nine and thirty-four in the earliest set (1444) to one hundred twelve in the largest (1592), and the sequence of events also varied. The additions and reorderings reflect shifts in official and popular conceptions of Confucius and in the treatment of his cult, as well as the adaptability of his image as a symbol in periods of political turbulence and socio-economic change. Prefaces and colophons offer some insight into the circumstances in which new sets of pictures were created and suggest the purposes that they were intended to serve. In this article, I will examine the origins and iconography of illustrated accounts of Confucius's life and investigate the relationships between different sets of pictures. Besides tracing illustrated episodes to textual sources, I will examine the influence of other pictures (including illustrated lives of other heroic individuals) on the conceptualization of the pictorial biography of Confucius. In the main section of the article, I will reconstruct the significant stages in the evolution of the Shengji tu theme in the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries, exploring at the same time the functions and significance of the illustrated biographies within a broader historical context. Finally, I will briefly examine the relationship between paintings on the theme of Shengji tu and the far more numerous printed editions and versions carved on stone tablets. THE CULT OF CONFUCIUS AND ITS USE OF ICONS The teachings of Confucius have wielded enormous influence on Chinese culture and statecraft for well over two thousand years, continuing even to the present. Although Confucius had been unable to influence the conduct of feudal rulers of his own time, in the centuries after his death, a modified version of his ideas became part of the ideology of imperial rule. Government officials were selected through competitive examinations that tested their knowledge of Confucian texts, and Confucius himself came to be honored as a teacher, preserver of ancient learning, paragon of moral conduct, upright official, and to a certain extent, superhuman hero. Today, Confucius is recognized through- 73</page><page sequence="2">out East Asia and the Chinese diaspora as the Great Teacher, whose ethical philosophy enabled Chi- nese civilization to thrive for so many centuries. Imperial recognition of Confucius took important ritual forms as well.I In 195 B.C., the Han em- peror Gaozu (r. 206-195 B.C.) established the precedent for imperial sacrifices to Confucius in Qufu, by personally making the pilgrimage to the sage's hometown and burial place.z Although few later rulers went to Qufu in person to perform the rites, regular sacrifices funded by the state and conducted by government officials were instituted during the Han and continued under later dy- nasties. In addition, the throne periodically conferred noble titles or other honors upon Confucius, and in I A.D., his lineal descendants were ennobled by Han Pingdi (r. 2 B.C.-5 A.D.). Emperors of later dynasties occasionally refurbished the ancestral temple in Qufu and continued to award titles and stipends to Confucius's descendants. Even twentieth-century regimes have exploited the sym- bolism of official support for the cult to further political and ideological purposes. At first sacrifices to Confucius were offered only in the Qufu temple, but later they were also conducted in other cities. Historical records indicate that by the second century of our era, iconic portraits of Confucius (either painted or sculptural) served as the focus for the offerings presented during these ceremonies.3 In 630o, Tang Taizong (r. 626-49) established an empire-wide network of Confucian temples in county and prefectural schools, which received state funding to carry out regu- lar sacrifices to Confucius. Tang imperial promotion of Confucius as the official patron of learning was part of a larger effort to attract the allegiance of educated men and recruit them to the civil service. However, the proliferation of temples containing iconic images of Confucius and his numer- ous disciples, and the religious character of the sacrifices themselves, also prompted his cult to de- velop certain characteristics of devotional religion, like Buddhism and Daoism. Although his temples were off limits to ordinary people, the fact that they existed at all must have suggested that Confucius was a deity, as well as a revered philosopher and teacher. The paintings and sculptures of Confucius and his disciples to which the sacrifices were offered belong to the larger category of commemorative portraiture, whose conventions were established in the Han dynasty.4 In addition to being made for use in funerary rites and memorial ceremonies, commemorative portraits also served didactic functions by perpetuating role models in visible (albeit idealized) form. Model figures were portrayed not with idiosyncratic physical features, but with the characteristics appropriate to their categorical "type," as expressed through posture, bodily propor- Specific information concerning the development of the cult of Confucius has been gathered by various modern scholars from numerous primary sources. I have particularly relied on the following: Qufu Kongmiao jianzhu, Nanjing Gongxueyuan jianzhuxi and Qufu wenwu guanli weiyuanhui, compilers (Nanjing, 1988); Huang Jinxing [Huang Chin-hsing], Youru shengyu (Taibei, 1994); John Shryock, The Origin and Development of the State Cult of Confucius (1932; repr. New York, 1966); Da zai Kongzi, Zhang Zuoyao, chief compiler (Hong Kong, 1991); and Thomas A. Wilson, Genealogy of the Way: The Construction and Uses of the Confucian Tradition in Late Imperial China (Stanford, 1995). 2 This event is commemorated in the Shengji tu, as illustrated in fig. 8. 3 The earliest recorded set of images of Confucius and seventy-two disciples was painted by Cai Yong in 178 A.D. on the walls of the Hongdumen school, established by Lingdi in the Eastern Han palace; Fan Ye, Hou Han Shu (Peking University punctuated and annotated edition, Beijing, 1965), juan 6o xia, 1998, biography of Cai Yong, also cited in Gugong shuhua lu (Taibei, 1965), juan 7, 62. For further information about early representations of Confucius, see Berthold Laufer, "Confucius and His Portraits," The Open Court 26 (1912): 147-68 and zo2-I8; and Shandongsheng Qufushi wenwu guanli weiyuanhui comp., Kongzi xiang, Yanshenggong jifuren xiaoxiang (Jinan, Shandong, 1987). 4 For recent studies of Chinese portraiture, see Dietrich Seckel, "The Rise of Portraiture in Chinese Art," Artibus Asiae 53 nos.

The background typically is blank, rather than delineating a particular setting. Although no early paintings of Confucius survive, images incised on stone tablets probably were based on them and suggest the general appearance of his portraits.5 In the best known image (fig. I) a three-quarter-profile view, Confucius stands in a dignified posture, wearing voluminous robes and cloth cap. A staff is tucked under his left arm, and his hands are clasped together at chest level. The formality of the pose, the generic physical appearance, and the absence of specific context or activity invest the image with the timeless quality of an icon.6 Some versions bear a title inscription, Xianshi Kongzi xingjiao xiang ("Portrait of the Former Teacher, Master Kong, Traveling and Teaching"), and a small notation at the side that credits the portrait to Wu Daozi (ca. 689-after 755), a celebrated Tang painter. This image is reflected in paintings on silk or paper and also was widely circulated through rubbings, readily obtained even today by visitors to Qufu, Beijing, and Xi'an. In Taiwan, a government-sponsored conference recommended in 1974 that the xingjiao image be adopted as the official portrait of Confucius.7 During the Ming dynasty (I368-I644), the cult of Confucius and his disciples became more clearly set apart from Buddhist and Daoist cults because its icons were taken away. In 1372, the Hongwu emperor ordered that sculptural images be removed from the Confucian temple attached to the imperial university in the capital (Nanjing) and replaced by wooden tablets merely inscribed with the names of Confucius and his followers. Memorials to the throne debated the appropriateness of Assorted portraits of Confucius are reproduced at the beginning of various editions of Queli zhi, first compiled in 13 juan by Chen Gao et al., with a preface dated 15o05 (of which I examined a copy in the National Central Library [Rare Book no. 2437] and a reprint of ca. 152o in the National Palace Museum, Taiwan [Rare Book no. 1207]). The compilation was subsequently expanded to I 5juan by Kong Honggan (a descendant of Confucius in the sixty-first generation) in 1552, of which a seventeenth- century reprint is in the Beijing Library (Rare Book no. 5614). A I2-juan edition was completed in 1599 but published circa 16o9 by Kong Zhencong in the sixty-third generation; a copy of the extremely rare original edition is in the Naikaku Bunko, Tokyo [shi 218-1]. A 24-juan edition compiled by the sixty-fifth-generation Yanshenggong, Kong Yinzhi (hao Duihuan; 1592-1I647), is well known from numerous Yongzheng-era reprints. Moreover, several incised portrait stones are housed in the Shengjidian (built in 1592) in the Temple of Confucius at Qufu, along with the set of narrative tablets from which the building took its name. It is not clear when the portrait steles were installed in the Shengjidian, but they are mentioned in a record dated 1687; see Queli ulenxian kao (1762), compiled by Kong Jifen (repr. Taibei, 1966), juan 34, 32b (modern 892); another list appears in juan 12, 3a (modern 213). Kong Jifen also provides an inventory of the Kong family collection of portraits on paper and silk, some of which may have been the models for the versions incised on the stone tablets; see Idem, Iia (modern 230). The incised-stone portraits are also itemized in Baba Harukichi, Koshi seiseki shi (Tokyo, I934), 162-69; and they are briefly discussed by Laufer (as in note 3), 159-63- 6 Iconic portraits that are intended to receive sacrifices, however, typically are frontal images, as is the portrait sculpture of Confucius in the temple in Qufu. The three-quarter profile seems more appropriate to figures in attendance upon the main recipient. One intriguing possibility is that the xingjiao image ultimately descends from a representation of the sage as the chief correlate (congpei) to the Duke of Zhou (fl. ca. IIth c. B.C.). According to Thomas Wilson (see note I), the Old Text account of the Confucian tradition cast the Duke of Zhou as the creative sage and Confucius as the great teacher and transmitter. At the beginning of the Tang, the title xiansheng (Former Sage) was held by the Duke of Zhou, and his image (probably sculptural) was the chief icon in Confucian temples, apart from the ancestral shrine of Confucius in Qufu. In such temples, the Duke's image was placed at the center of the north wall facing south, accompanied by a portrait of Confucius as his correlate, facing west. In 628 Tang Taizong awarded Confucius the title of "Former Sage" (see Da zai Kongzi, as in note I, p. 361), and his image was given the place of honor in Confucian temples; the Duke of Zhou was reclassified as one of the "Six Rulers" and his image placed in the temples of Zhou kings Wu and Cheng (Wilson, 33-34). Paintings of Confucius and his disciples in an Eastern Han temple to the Duke of Zhou in Chengdu were recorded by Huang Xiufu, Yizhou minghua lu (preface Ioo6), in Zhongguo meishu lunzhu congkan (Beijing, 1964; reprinted 1983), juan xia, 61. Huang says that the paintings were originally done in 194 A.D. and were restored by Zhang Shou in the late third century. Laufer adds, without citing a source, that copies in scroll form were made in the mid-eleventh century by a "Wang-kung Su- ming" (no characters given), and engraved stone tablets were created in the mid-twelfth; see Laufer (as in note 75), 151. 7 Cai Wenyi, "Kongzi shengxiang tantao," Guoli lishi bowuguan guankan 8 (October 1976): 114-18. 75</page><page sequence="4">icons intermittently thereafter. A few statesmen and emperors argued that the use of icons repre- sented an intrusion into the state cult of Confucius from Buddhism, whose Indian origins made it a foreign religion.9 Finally, in 1530, the Jiajing emperor issued an imperial decree requiring all Con- fucian temples to substitute inscribed tablets for pictorial or sculptural icons.'o Only the Confucian temple in Qufu was allowed to retain representational images because it was also the ancestral temple of the Kong family. From 153o onward, Confucian temples have enshrined only the tablets bearing the names of Confucius, his disciples, and the scholar-statesmen who were added to the cult in later times. Initially, there was resistance to the destruction of the figural icons among officials and com- moners alike. In Wenzhou, Zhejiang, not far from where the "southern branch" of the Qufu temple had been founded during the Southern Song (in Quzhou),I" the local people successfully petitioned for permission to take the temple's wooden statues out to sea rather than destroy them outright; and some were secretly rescued and installed in roadside shrines." Another controversial element of the Jiajing emperor's ritual reform was the reduction of the noble ranks posthumously awarded to Confucius and his followers. Ever since the eighth century, Confucius had held the title of king (wang), and his disciples and later worthies had also received various degrees of nobility. In 1530, Confucius's title was changed to Ultimate Sage and Foremost Teacher (Zhisheng xianshi), the four men who received sacrifices as his correlates (congpei) were designated Sages (sheng), and the rest were divided into Former Worthies (xianxian) and Former Scholars (xianru). Wilson (as in note I), 56-58; further discussed by Deborah A. Sommer in "Images into Words: Ming Confucian Iconoclasm," National Palace Museum Bulletin 29 nos. I-2 (March-June 1994): 1-24. Sommer clarifies that the initial iconoclasm took place in 1372 rather than 1382, contrary to certain accounts. 9 This line of argument is associated particularly with Qiu Jun (1421-95), whose ideas were presented in 1487 but not immediately adopted; see Sommer (as in note 8). In the Song period, Zhu Xi had argued against sacrificing to images of Confucius; see Wing-tsit Chan, "Chu Hsi and the Academies", in Neo-Confucian Education, edited by William T. De Bary and John W. Chaffee (New York, 1989), 400oo-ol. A concern with separating Confucian rites from those of Buddhism and Daoism in ancestor worship is expressed by Zhu Xi as well as Cheng Yi; see Patricia Ebrey, "Education through Ritual: Efforts to Formulate Family Rituals During the Sung Period," in Ibid., 3ol-o2. Buddhist elements were thoroughly entrenched in Chinese thought and religion by the Ming period, however, and most people were not concerned about Buddhism's foreign origins. Io The chief proponent of the interdiction was the Grand Secretary Zhang Cong (I475-1539), to whom the Jiajing emperor was indebted for getting his way in the Great Rites Controversy of 1i52I-24. With the support of Zhang Cong, the Jiajing emperor successfully refused to become the adopted son of the Zhengde emperor (r. 1506-2I), his predecessor and uncle. Thomas Wilson (as in note i) suggests that this obligation motivated the emperor to endorse Zhang's crusade to remove icons from Confucian temples; see 57. For thorough discussions of the Great Rites Controversy, see Carney T. Fisher, The Chosen One: Succession and Adoption in the Court of Ming Shizong (Sydney, Wellington, London &amp; Boston, 199o0); also The Chinese Rites Controversy, Its History and Meaning, edited by David E. Mungello, Monumenta Serica Monographs, vol. 33 (Sankt Augustin and San Francisco, 1995). S Because Qufu came under Jin control in 1127, Kong Duanyou, the forty-eighth-generation descendant of Confucius and holder of the title Yanshenggong (awarded to the senior male in each generation), fled south. After his death, Song Gaozong assigned the title Yanshenggong and stipendiary lands in Quzhou to Kong Jielong in the forty-ninth generation. However, after an initial interruption, the Jin patronized the Qufu temple and gave the title Yanshenggong to descendants who had stayed in the north, creating a parallel lineage of title-holders. For details, see Da zai Kongzi (as in note I), 329-30; also Queli zhi (as in note 5; I5o5 edition), juan 7, I9b-2oa. A single line of title-holders in Qufu resumed with the Yuan reunification. 12 Wilson (as in note I), 284, note 143. Perhaps there is a similar explanation for the survival of Yuan or Ming clay sculptures of Confucius, the Four Correlates, and the Ten Paragons, in a village in Pingyao xian, Shaanxi; see Da zai Kongzi (as in note I), 332-34; also the overseas edition of Renmin Ribao, July 7, 1993. In recent years, many Confucian temples in mainland China have reintroduced statues of Confucius in order to attract tourists. 76</page><page sequence="5">NARRATIVE REPRESENTATIONS In contrast to the numerous iconic portraits of Confucius and his followers produced from the Han through Ming periods, there are exceedingly few pre-Ming depictions of Confucius that embody or even imply any sort of narrative. For our present purpose, a narrative representation may be defined simply as a picture that refers to a story,13 as opposed to the icon, which is experienced as an isolated, timeless image. It is important to note that narrative pictures played no role in the temple rituals of the cult of Confucius, in contrast to icons. Before the fifteenth-century emergence of the linked series of biographical pictures known as the Shengji tu, there existed only a small number of unrelated illustrations that portrayed Confucius in a narrative context. Two of the episodes depicted became part of the Shengji tu sequence. The earliest and best known narrative compositions that include Confucius appear on second- century incised stone slabs, such as those at the Wu Family Shrines. One well-known tableau shows his purported meeting with the Daoist sage, Laozi, who is characterized in Confucian texts as an authority on ancient Zhou ritual practice, rather than solely as a rival philosopher.I4 Another scene in the Wu Family Shrines shows Confucius striking a stone chime, alluding to an anecdote in which Confucian and Daoist values are contrasted: A basket-laden Daoist recluse hears Confucius playing for the disciples, and recognizing stubborn sincerity in the music, chides him for persisting in his crusade to reform society when the effort so obviously is doomed.I5 Both scenes later became core episodes in the Shengji tu (figs. 7, 23, 24, 26).16 A third incident that is represented on other Han stones but not in the Shengji tu is the meeting between Confucius and the boy-sage Xiang Tuo.17 All three scenes are cryptically concise, and only an informed viewer would recognize what they depict. Moreover, they typically are juxtaposed with other themes that make a similar rhetorical point, rather than with additional stories about Confucius, and so do not suggest a fuller pictorial bio- graphy. It could be argued, following Weitzmann,18 that these episodes were excerpted from an earlier, larger set, and then were inserted into new contexts. However, the argument is unconvincing, because there is no direct or indirect evidence for other biographical scenes in the Han period. In the Tang period, at least two bronze mirrors depict a fourth narrative, whose subject is an encounter between the fairly dour Confucius and the happy Daoist recluse Rong Qiqi. Berthold Laufer traces it 1 A useful introduction to narrative illustration and its extensive bibliography is Studies in the History of Art, vol. 16: Pictorial Narrative in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, edited by Herbert L. Kessler and Marianna Shreve Simpson (Washington, 1985). A more recent theoretical treatment is provided in W.J.T. Mitchell, Picture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation (Chicago and London, 1994). 14 The scene is reproduced and discussed in Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine (Stanford, 1989), 43-44; Wu also notes (on p. 4) that a rubbing of the scene was first published in the Southern Song period in Hong Kuo's Li xu. See also Edouard Chavannes, Mission Archeologique dans la Chine septentrionale (Paris, 1913), vol. 2, pl. 71, no. 137; and Laufer (as in note 3), 152-53. The meeting between Confucius and Laozi is recorded in Sima Qian, Shiji (Beijing, I959),juan 47, 1909. 1 The scene is discussed and reproduced in Laufer (as in note 3), 153-54; also Chavannes (as in note W4), vol. 2, pl. 75, no. 143. The story appears in the Lunyu (XIV, 42) and Shiji, juan 47, 1925. In the edition published by the modern bibliophile Zheng Zhenduo as the original version (see note 84), the two incidents occupy scenes II and 25, respectively. 7 The scene appears on various stones from the Jiaxiang area of Shandong, of which two are represented by rubbings in the Field Museum (acc. no. 245533 from Hongjiamiao and acc. no. 245539 from Caishiyuan), and others are reproduced in Martin J. Powers, Art and Political Expression in Early China (New Haven and London, I990), 44, 149, and 167; and discussed on 20zo4-20zos. The encounter is mentioned in Shiji, juan 71, 2319. Kurt Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex, 2nd ed. (Princeton, 1970), esp. z23-33. 77</page><page sequence="6">to a Daoist source and interprets it as symbolizing the superiority of Daoist values over Confucian ones,19 so it is no surprise that the scene did not find a place in the Shengi tu. Various representations of Confucius in the company of his disciples form another category of images that predate the Shengji tu.2? These compositions range from iconic linear arrays2' to scenes in which the disciples gather around Confucius's seat to hear his teachings.22 Portrayals of Confucius with his disciples focus attention upon his role as a teacher and transmitter and thus convey more specific symbolism than icons of the philosopher as a solitary figure. Another group of symbolic compositions shows Confucius riding in a carriage, signifying his travels among the states in search of a good ruler to serve.23 These images emphasize his statesmanship, alluding to the larger socio- political context of his life's work. Neither group of pictures can be characterized as fullblown narrative illustration, in the sense of depicting specific events; both present generic tableaux that are more appropriately described as symbolic. Nonetheless, both kinds of symbolic tableaux provided compositional formulas that were later used in the Shengji tu, because many of the biographical episodes chosen for illustration involved Confucius's teaching or statesmanship. Even if we take a very broad definition of the term "narrative illustration" and include all of the representations briefly introduced above, however, they still constitute a surprisingly meager stock. The creation of the Shengfi tu in 1444 represents not just a sudden and dramatic expansion of narrative imagery related to Confucius, but even more importantly, the emergence of a comprehensive, multi- episode, pictorial biography. Why was there no need or demand for an illustrated account of Confucius's life before the middle Ming period? What was it intended to do? And why did it become such a popular subject in the late Ming?24 Partial answers may be suggested by considering some of the political, social, and ritual concerns of the period. i9 Laufer (as in note 3, 156-58) reproduces a fragmentary example and complete line drawing, and traces the anecdote to the Liezi (I, 9). The story appears in neither the Shiji nor the Kongzi jiayu. 20 Many of the examples discussed in this paragraph are reproduced from earlier sources in various editions of Queli zhi (see note 78). The pictures are also enumerated in Queli wenxian kao (as in note 78), juan 12, IIb (modern 230). 1 Examples include scenes at the Wu Family Shrines, discussed by Laufer (as in note 3), 152 and reproduced in Edouard Chavannes, La sculpture surpierre en Chine (Paris, 1893), pls. 8, 12, 22, and 26; and the mid-twelfth century engraved stones at the Confucian Temple in Hangzhou, discussed and partially reproduced in my article, "The Hangzhou Portraits of Confucius and 72 Disciples (Shengxian tu): Art in the Service of Politics," in The Art Bulletin 74 (March 1992): 7-18. A replica of the Southern Song stones was made in 1991 for display at the Temple of Confucius in Qufu. 22 Illustrated versions of the Xiaojing portray Confucius surrounded by disciples in the opening scene; for a representative example, see Richard M. Barnhart, Li Kung-lin's Classic of Filial Piety (New York, 1993), 82, fig. 37. A similar tableau also introduced Ma Hezhi's (fl. mid-late Izth c.) now-lost illustrations of the Zhounan, the first chapter of poems in the Shijing; see Sun Chengze, Gengzi xiaoxia ji (I66o),juan I, 17. A comparable scene, entitled "Pingji" (Leaning on the Bench), appears as the second illustration in Kong Yuancuo, Kongshi zuting guangji (preface 1227, Jin); reprinted in the series Biji san bian (Taibei, 1970). The picture is signed by "Imperial university student Ma Tianchang". In a related composition, entitled "Xingtan" (Apricot Altar), Confucius plays his lute and sings to assembled disciples. This scene is included in the late Southern Song (1254) expanded edition of Kong Chuan, Dongjia zaji (compiled II34; see note 34) and in Lunyu zuantu (1296); both are reproduced in Zhonghua wuqiannian wenwu jikan, banhua bian, Zhe Fu, editor (Taibei, 1991), vol. I, nos. 27 and 49, respectively. 23 For example, see Kongshi zuting guangji (as in note 22), 3a-b. 24 Various writers have asserted that the subject was painted earlier, but such claims are not substantiated by early sources. It seems a common practice in China to invent plausible early antecedents in order to endow recent phenomena or practices with greater distinction and authority. Wang Zhenpeng (ca. I28o-ca. 1329) was the first pre-Ming artist to be named in connection with the Shengji tu, in what purports to be a transcription of a IIo-dated colophon to a now-lost set of paintings attributed to Wang (see p. II9ff). Later writers raised the stakes by positing Tang origins for the theme. Sun Yuxiu wrote in 1914 that the Shengji tu was recorded in Tang and Song compendia on painting; see Sun Yuxiu, Shengfi tu: Sketches of Confiucius, translated by Gan Zuolin (Shanghai, 1935), iv. It seems likely that Sun was thinking of references to portraits of Confucius. His statement was repeated by Baba Harukichi (as in note 5, 170); Aying [Qian Xingcun], Zhongguo lianhuan tuhua shihua (Beijing, 1980), 4; and most recently by Kaji Nobuyuki; see K-shi gaden (Tokyo, I99I), 4. 78</page><page sequence="7">It seems highly significant that the Shengji tu appeared just when the conflicts between scholar- officials in the civil service bureaucracy and eunuchs in the imperial palace began to intensify. For scholar-officials, who were educated in Confucian texts and steeped in the principles of Confucian morality in preparation for careers of conscientious service, the life of Confucius may have been both a role model and a unifying symbol, the very embodiment of their lofty ideals. 5 It is worth high- lighting the fact that the first Shengji tu was created by a censorial official, whose job required that he be particularly sensitive to these ideals in assessing the performance of fellow officials. 6 Furthermore, Confucius provided a model for respectable failure when times were bad. For officials to play their roles successfully, a conscientious emperor steeped in Confucian ideology was also required, and most Ming emperors fell far short of the ideal. In the middle and late Ming, court eunuchs became powerful and factional struggles among officials multiplied, making government service increasingly treacherous. In this context, Confucius's uncompromising adherence to principle, tinged by self- righteous moralism, could also evoke admiration and imitation. Prefaces and colophons to the vari- ous editions of the Shengji tu that appeared between 1444 and 1644 frequently express a desire to reform the character of political life through spiritual renewal. The pictures were intended to bring Confucius vividly to the viewers' consciousness and stimulate them to think about the moral prin- ciples by which he had lived. In this way, the pictorial biographies would foster renewed commit- ment and dedication to these ideals. Equally pertinent to the creation and evolution of the pictorial biographies of Confucius were the ongoing Ming controversies over the ritual practices of the state, including the cult of Confucius. Implicit in the debate over whether it was appropriate for Confucian temples to have anthropomor- phic icons was the issue of whether the great teacher/statesman was a deity or simply an exceptional human being. In contrast to the Buddha, whose pictorial biography was formulated in the context of evangelism, Confucius was never worshipped by a broadly based, organized religion. Nor was he the focus of a popular cult, as was the Daoist Lii Dongbin, whose life was also canonized in a multi-scene pictorial biography. 7 Miraculous powers were not ascribed to Confucius's image, and people prob- ably did not pray to him for divine aid. Nonetheless, his status was something between man and deity, and his physical representation evoked a body of beliefs and values.'8 Before 1530o, Confucian temples contained representational icons of the Sage and his followers, which offered the latter-day 25 Indeed, officials were selected from the ranks of those whose answers in the civil service examinations demonstrated a thorough indoctrination in the moral and cultural values embodied by the Four Books and Five Classics; see essays in Education and Society in Late Imperial China, Idoo-ipoo, Benjamin A. Elman and Alexander Woodside, eds. (Berkeley, 1994). A more critical view of these ideals appears in William T. de Bary, The Trouble with Confucianism (Cambridge, 1991). I use the term "censor" to include officials in both the Metropolitan Censorate and the Provincial Surveillance Offices, whose functions emphasized remonstrance and impeachment, respectively. See Charles Hucker, The Censorial System of Ming China (Stanford, 1966). 27 The life of Li Dongbin is represented in fifty-two scenes (with cartouches identifying them) painted on the walls of the Chunyangdian at the Yonglegong, the Yuan-period Daoist temple in Ruicheng, Shanxi; partially reproduced and discussed in Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt, "Zhu Haogu Reconsidered: A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Taoist Style," Artibus Asiae 48, nos. 1/2 (1987): 5-38. Also useful is Paul R. Katz, "The Function of Temple Murals in Imperial China: The Case of the Yung-lo Kung,"Journal ofChinesre Religions 21 (Fall 1993): 45-67. What these values were depended on one's point of view; where a pragmatic emperor might emphasize hierarchical subordination, an idealistic scholar might stress cultivation of personal character. In this regard, it is revealing that the Ming emperor Yingzong ordered a statue of Confucius to be cast in copper (with gold embellishments) and placed outside the Wenyuange (a building in the palace) in 1457, and ministers were ordered to salute it four times before entering; see Laufer (as in note 3, PP. 165-66); also the 1609 and later editions of Queli zhi (as in note 5), juan i, Ib. Having just regained the throne after being held hostage for seven years, Yingzong needed to reestablish scholar-officials' allegiance to his authority. 79</page><page sequence="8">devotee (primarily students and officials) the possibility of direct and inspirational contact with holy presences in his own locality. The substitution of nonrepresentational inscribed tablets for iconic portraits in all but one Confucian temple greatly diminished the power of this experience, because tablets had less psychological immediacy than representational images. In the period following the removal of icons, there was an upsurge in the production of pictorial biographies of Confucius: new editions of Shengji tu, commercial reprints, and creative variations published under other titles. These offered the devotee an alternative means of experiencing the Sage and addressed an enduring desire for representational embodiments, which inscribed tablets could not satisfy. Given that the icons had been removed in order to free the cult of Confucius from the taint of Buddhist practices, it is ironic that their disappearance stimulated the production of pictorial hagiographies, a mode of representation with equally strong Buddhist affiliations. The publication and distribution of these illustrations were viewed as meritorious in their own right, perhaps because of the precedent created by Buddhist merit-making practices. In a sense, the pictures of Confucius's life offered a means for his cult to continue to compete with Buddhism and various deity cults . The great expansion in the late Ming publishing industry in general was also an important force behind the increase and diversification of woodblock-printed pictorial biographies of Confucius in the late sixteenth century. They were just one of many types of illustrated work published in the flourishing cities of the lower Yangzi delta, whose prosperity and cultural activity were fostered by an increasingly commercialized economy. Woodblock-printed books provided not only the learning that the moderately literate needed in order to advance socially, but also moral or religious instruction, and leisure-time entertainment. The commercial publishers who emerged in great num- bers to serve these markets republished or excerpted many existing works that had previously circulated within exclusive circles. SOURCES FOR THE ILLUSTRATED BIOGRAPHY OF CONFUCIUS The most comprehensive early account of Confucius's life appears in the "Kongzi shijia" chapter of the Shiji by Sima Qian (ca. I45-ca. 86 B.C.).29 Sima Qian constructed a chronological biography from sources believed to be written or edited by Confucius himself and from writings based on oral traditions handed down by Confucius's disciples. First summarizing Confucius's family background and humble early life, Sima chronicled his fortunes in the service of one petty ruler after another, ending with his death and the honors he received posthumously. Additional anecdotes are recorded in "Zhongni dizi liezhuan," the chapter on Confucius's disciples.30 By the Ming period, a simplified and annotated revision of the "Kongzi shijia," made by Zhu Xi (0130-I200), had become the standard introduction to Confucius's life.I Prepared as a preface to Zhu's edition of the Lunyu (Analects), this revised biography eliminated what Zhu deemed inessential or unflattering in Sima Qian's discursive account, particularly references to Confucius's humble origins and digressions about other persons Shit, juan 47, I905-47. Even though Confucius was not a feudal noble, Sima Qian placed his biography in the shijia (hereditary nobility) section rather than in the liezhuan (biographies), to express his veneration for Confucius. A highly critical analysis of this biography is presented in H. G. Creel, Confucius: The Man and the Myth (London, 1951). My survey of textual sources for Confucius's biography is greatly indebted to researchassistance provided by Lii Zongli, while a graduate student in East Asian Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin. 30 Shiji, juan 9, liezhuan 7, 2185-2226. 31 See Zhu Xi, Sishu jizhu (reprint, Taibei, 1959), 29-31. 80</page><page sequence="9">and events in which Confucius was not directly involved. The resulting biographical sketch presen- ted Confucius as a highly idealized role model for the scholar-statesman. The Lunyu itself was also a rich source of anecdotes concerning Confucius and his responses to a variety of situations. Zhu Xi's edition of the Lunyu was familiar to all educated people, particularly to those who prepared for the civil service examinations, because it was one of the Four Books and thus a fundamental text in the examination curriculum. Another major source for Confucius's biography was the Kongzi jiayu (Family Sayings of Confucius), which was reputedly discovered in the wall of Confucius's house during the Han period, and was later edited and annotated by Wang Su (195-256).32 Wang Su characterized the text as a col- lection of biographical anecdotes about Confucius, compiled as a supplement to the Lunyu. TheJiayu fell out of favor during the Song period and virtually disappeared until the sixteenth century, when it was edited and reprinted in numerous editions.33 Besides the fairly mundane accounts contained in the Shit, Lunyu, andjiayu, stories with fantastic or magical aspects also became part of the lore of the Sage. These surfaced in publications by later descendants of Confucius, most notably Kong Chuan's Dongjia zaji (1134) and Kong Yuancuo's Kongshi zuting guang-i (1227).34 Some of the supernatural elements may have come from Han New Text versions of Confucian writings, which exalted Confucius as the uncrowned king (suwang).35 Other occult additions can be traced to Buddhist and Daoist ideas about the attributes of deities. For example, Kong Yuancuo enumerated forty-nine bodily signs (biao) that physically marked Confucius as a special being.36 Inspired by the thirty-two marks that distinguished the Buddha Sakyamuni's body from that of ordinary mortals, the attribution of a larger number to Confucius also implied that he was superior to the Buddha. In addition to textual sources concerning Confucius, illustrations of the life of the Buddha S"kya- muni also contributed to the invention of a pictorial biography for Confucius. Depicted in Indian art at least as early as the first century B.C.,37 sequential narrative representations of the Buddha's life were first painted in China during the period of Northern and Southern Dynasties.38 More immedi- ately relevant to the creation of a pictorial biography of Confucius, however, were much later illustrations of the life of the Buddha, particularly an early Ming woodblock-printed book entitled Shijiarulai chengdao yinghua shiji ji (often shortened to Shishi yuanliu), compiled and edited by 32 See R. P. Kramers, K'ung-tzu chia-yii (Leiden, 1950). Creel (as in note 29) dismisses much of the text as Han fabrication. My references are to the reprint edited by Yang Jialuo (Taibei, 1962). 33 Kramers, 38-41. 34 Dongfia zaji is included in Linlangbishi congshu, Hu Ting comp.

They are listed and explained (in French) in Henri Dore, Recherches sur les Superstitions en Chine (Shanghai, I918), part 3, vol. 13, 2-6. 37 The earliest narrative cycles depicting the life of the Buddha are found at the stupas of Safici (Ist c. B.C.) and Amaravati (2nd- 3rd c. A.D.). At neither site is the Buddha represented in anthropomorphic form; instead, his presence is signified by symbols. Narrative cycles containing anthropomorphic images of the Buddha first occur in Gandhdran stone reliefs of the 2nd-4th c. A.D. 38 The pictures on the back of a stone stele dated 543 (Eastern Wei) probably preserve compositions from handscroll paintings of the life of the Buddha; see Nagahiro Toshio, Rikucho jidai bijutsu no kenkyze (Research on the arts of the Six Dynasties' period), (Tokyo, 1969), pl. lO.

Below each scene is a four-character title and a quotation from one of several sources cited by name. Like the illustrated Life of the Buddha, or various Lives of Western saints, the Shengii tu is a linked series of pictures whose seemingly comprehensive recounting of events is meant to foster an inspirational experience in the viewer. The construction of episodes into a unified biographical se- quence shapes the meaning of the paragon's life, even as it limits the possibilities of alternate interpretations. In each scene of the Shengji tu, Confucius is portrayed as a sage of great dignity and intelligence, whether experiencing tribulation or fulfilment. Amid the machinations of lesser men, his large, stately figure is a steadfast center of visual and moral gravity. The earliest edition of the Shengji tu largely confines its treatment to mundane biographical events, but later expansions of the pictorial cycle include the supernatural elements that identify Confucius as a heaven-sent hero. His birth and death become presaged by heavenly omens, and the completion of his editorial labors is rewarded with a manifestation of celestial approval. Canonical authority for all the events illustrated, whether prosaic or fantastic, is invoked in the inscriptions that appear on or adjacent to each picture. The pictorial images usually receive primary emphasis, and the texts are inscribed above, beside, or in blank areas of the pictures. In the next section, I will trace the evolution of the Shengji tu iconography through several expansions of the core set of scenes, represen- ted by various versions of the Shengji tu and a few other related works. These examples will exhibit significant variations not only in the number and character of episodes illustrated, but also in the content of texts accompanying the pictures. Moreover, differences will be observed in the size and arrangement of compositions depicting the same events, and in the visual relationships between pic- ture and text. Never a static compendium, the Shengji tu adapted to reflect shifting concerns. The changes from one set to the next sometimes provide insight into the political, social, and ritual issues of concern to the sponsor(s). GENEALOGY OF THE SHENGJI TU i. First Recension40 The earliest set of pictures of Confucius's life was put together by the censor Zhang Kai (zi, Shizhi; I398-I460),4' whose colophon to the work is dated in accordance with August Io, I444.41 Zhang 39 The Baoensi presumably refers to the famous temple in Nanjing. An early Ming edition of the book, bearing the full title, is in the National Central Library (Rare Book no. 8967). Later editions include one sponsored by the Manchu prince Yongshan in I793, entitled Shijiarulai yinghua shiji, which was reprinted in 1808, and again in 1941 (Manchoukuo) in reduced size, with two hundred eight scenes. Like the Shengfi tu, woodblock-illustrated editions of the life of S'kyamuni reveal considerable flexibility in the numbers and sequence of episodes, physical relationship between pictures and texts, dimensions of the volume, and even the title of the set. 40 The term "recension" will be used for major changes in the contents of the Shengji tu, and minor variations will be called "editions." "Version" may refer to either. All versions of the Shengji tu that are discussed here are listed in the Appendix. 4' The major sources for Zhang Kai's biography, as given by the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Combined Indices to Eighty-nine Collections ofMing Dynasty Biographies (Sinological Index Series no. 24), are Lei Li (15O05-81), comp., Guochao lieqingfi (reprint Taibei, I99I), juan 30, 5b-7a (modern 037-820 - 037-823); and Jiao Hong (154I-162o), comp., Guochao xianzheng lu (reprint Taibei, 199I), juan 64, 75a-77b. An important additional source, cited by Sat6 Kazuyoshi's essay in Kaji (see note 24, p. 161), is a posthumous career summary written by Yang Shouchen (b. 1425; jinshi 1451), entitled "Nanjing you qian du yushi Zhanggong xingzhuang;" published in Yang Wenyigong wenji, juan 7, 13b-I8a (included in Zhang Shouyong, compiler, Siming 82</page><page sequence="11">was a native of Siming (modern Ningbo) who passed the jinshi examination in 1424 and rose steadily through official ranks. Between 1440 and 1447, he served first as Assistant Surveillance Commissioner (ancha qianshi) then as Surveillance Vice Commissioner (fu yushi) in Shaanxi prov- ince.43 Zhang's biographers characterize him as a successful official and able administrator, with particular expertise in criminal justice, border affairs, and fiscal administration. His interest in Confucius and Confucian ideology may be conjectured not only from his compilation of the Shengji tu but also from his critique on the Four Books, entitled Sijing kangpi. He also produced copious poetry in the Tang style, which was admired and collected even by foreigners from Korea and Japan.44 Although Zhang Kai's Shengji tu does not survive in independent form,45 later editions allow most of it to be reconstructed. His compilation contained between twenty-nine and thirty-four annotated pictures that portrayed episodes of Confucius's life,46 based primarily on the "Kongzi shijia" chapter of the Shiji. To accompany the pictorial representation of each event, Zhang tran- scribed the relevant text from Sima Qian and composed a poetic eulogy (zan) of his own. From the later editions discussed below, it may be deduced that the writings were placed outside the borders of the pictures, and that the compositions were wide and rectangular. The wording of Zhang's colophon indicates that the compilation took the form of a handscroll. However, the first writer who mentions Zhang's Shengji tu states that the pictures and texts were carved on stone tablets, which were kept by Zhang's family after his death.47 In all probability, his handscroll was copied onto stones to ensure that the work would endure. Zhang's colophon includes the following information: I compiled these pictures and composed introductions and eulogies for each incident, based on what is recorded in the Shiji, taking its detailed account as something that can be relied on. As for a general preface at congshu, series 7 (1940; reprint ed. Taibei, 1988), vol. 25, 607-o9). Zhang Kai also is mentioned in the Dictionary of Ming Biography, edited by L. C. Goodrich and Chaoying Fang (New York and London, 1976), p. 1275 (where his zi is incorrectly given as Zhengzhi). Zhang's compilation of the Shengji tu is mentioned only by Yang Shouchen (p. I8a). 42 See Appendix, item [A-I]. The date of Zhang's colophon to the Shengji tu is given as Zhengtong jiazi qiyue wangri. 43 In 1447, he was promoted to Associate Censor-in-chief (duchayuan you qian du yushi) in the capital. He was stripped of his position by the Jingtai emperor (r. 145o-56) but regained it in 1457, when Yingzong returned to the throne (as the Tianshun emperor) and pardoned him. 44 Sato Kazuyoshi has made a detailed study of Zhang Kai's poetry and official career in an article entitled "Cho Ki no shogai to shisaku to Seiseki zu," Gakuda kokubun no. 34 (1991-92). 79-98. 4 Zheng Zhenduo published his own copy of what he believed to be the 1444 first edition, in which some pages were fragmentary (see Appendix A-7). Kaji Nobuyuki (see note 24) and I have separately come to the conclusion that Zheng's book cannot be the 1444 compilation, but rather belongs to the lineage of the I497 second recension (described below), although it lacks the 1497 postface. 46 The 1497 postface to the second edition, discussed below, refers to twenty-nine episodes. Yang Shouchen (see note 40) says there were thirty-four. Both numbers are so precise that the writers must actually have counted the scenes. Because Yang's is the earlier account, it seems likely that the 1497 reference is to an incomplete set. 47 Yang Shouchen, I8a. Traditional and modern scholars alike, including Kaji Nobuyuki, have assumed that Zhang's Shengji tu was produced in the woodblock medium. Yang's statement that the work was carved on stone is undoubtedly reliable, because he was personally acquainted with Zhang Kai's family. A 16Io-dated inscription by a descendant, Zhang Jiude, mentions that the tablets were still there but covered with cobwebs when he was growing up; quoted in Kongzhai zhi, Kong Yuqi, comp., ca. 1716, reprinted in Kongzi wenhua daquan (Jinan, Shandong, I990), juan 5, 4a (modern 337). 83</page><page sequence="12">the beginning of the volume, I transcribed Zhu Xi's annotated version [of the "Kongzi Shijia"], taking its summary as the truncated version.48 Zhang's comments could be interpreted to mean that he gathered existing pictures and then sup- plied them with explanatory annotations and celebratory poems. If the pictures had been by a noted artist, Zhang probably would have recorded the name. It seems more likely that Zhang commissioned illustrations from a professional painter (huagong), a category of artist whose works are usually anonymous. In any event, Ming and earlier catalogues of painting do not list the Shengji tu under the name of any master, and it is only in nineteenth and twentieth-century writings that the subject is attributed to Yan Liben (d. 673), Li Gonglin (ca. 104I--IIO6), and Wang Zhenpeng (ca. Iz8O--ca. 1329).49 As reconstructed from later versions, Zhang Kai's Shengji tu began with a symbolic portrait that served as a frontispiece. It showed an elderly Confucius, attended by his beloved disciple Yan Hui, standing in a landscape setting (fig. 3). The pair of figures is conceptually close to and prob- ably based on stone engravings of 11o7 and 1118, which reproduce a painting attributed to Wu Daozi.S5o The biographical sequence starts with a scene in which Confucius's mother prays for a son on the top of Nishan (scene 2; fig. 4), then moves quickly from his childhood (symbolized by his playing at performing rites, scene 3 [fig. 5], to his early career as local administrator (supervising a granary in scene 4, and livestock in scene 5 [fig. 6]), and attests to his ongoing pursuit of learning (studying the qin in scene 6, and visiting Laozi to discuss Zhou ritual in scene 7 [fig. 7]). Subse- quent compositions show Confucius advising or quitting the courts of sundry local rulers, and steadily gathering disciples. The series ends with two events after Confucius's death: his disciples mourning at his grave mound (scene 28); and the Han emperor Gaozu sacrificing in the temple of 48 In fact, Zhang Kai did not reprint absolutely all of Zhu Xi's text; he omitted the last section, where Zhu quoted other Confucian scholars' comments about the Lunyu. Zheng Zhenduo's widely known reproduction (see Appendix A-7) omits part of the line in which Zhang Kai describes how he created the set. I was initially able to reconstruct the missing section because Zhang's colophon is preserved in a reprint of the 1497 edition belonging to the Harvard University Art Museums, which is discussed below. 49 See note 24. As discussed below, two paintings that purport to be by Wang Zhenpeng are demonstrably later than his time. 50 The 1107 tablet is preserved in Xi'an, along with a copy made in 1563, and another version of the picture was carved in III8 on a tablet kept in the Temple of Confucius in Qufu; see Laufer (as in note 3), 167-68. The image was published in the 1242 edition of Kong Yuancuo's Kongsrhi Zuting guangfi (see note 22), as the first illustration following the table of contents; and in Queli zhi (see note 5), on p. za of the first juan of the 15O05 edition. One point worth noting is that while the Song-Yuan portraits show Confucius wearing an official's headgear, the opening scene in most editions of Shengji tu gives him just the simple cloth cap of a scholar, as do some of the images attributed to Wu Daozi (see discussion of portraits in note 5). From 739 until 1530, Confucius had the honorific title of king (wang), but the Jiajing emperor removed that designation in favor of "Ultimate Sage and Foremost Teacher" (Zhisheng xianshi); see Da zai Kongzi (as in note I), 361. Therefore, the cloth cap may indicate that these editions are later than 1530, or that the image of Confucius is based on an early Tang model, or even that they reflect a view that led to the Jiajing reform; i.e., that Confucius should be characterized primarily as a scholar because of his lasting contributions to learning. Under the Qing, in 1645, Confucius received the honorific title of "Greatly Accomplished Ultimate Sage and Culture-Propagating Foremost Teacher" (Dacheng zhisheng wenxuan xianshi), but in 1657 it reverted to the Ming designation, Zhisheng xianshi. In iconic representation, however, the regal image of Confucius retained currency. A portrait in which he wears an emperor's crown and sits on a throne in frontal perspective, like a Daoist deity, was added to the series of images at the beginning of Queli zhi in the edition of circa 16og (see note 5), and it was retained in Qing reprints of that work. The image is entitled "Master Kong, the Greatly Accomplished Ultimate Sage and Culture-Propagating Foremost Teacher" (Dacheng zhisheng wenxuan xianshi Kongzi; i.e., the title current from 1645-57) and a note following the plates explains that imperial regalia entered the iconography of Confucius during the Tang dynasty. The portrait sculpture of Confucius in the main hall of the temple in Qufu also exhibits this imagery. 84</page><page sequence="13">Confucius over two hundred years later (scene 29; fig. 8), marking the start of imperial support for the cult of Confucius. As reconstructed, the original recension consisted of straightforward illustrations of incidents or situations that epitomized Confucius's moral character and the vicissitudes of his career as a statesman and scholar. Only one of the twenty-nine scenes depicts an event with a supernatural overtone: Confucius's discovery of a qilin killed by hunters (scene 36; fig. 9), which was a sign that the times were inhospitable for a sage and an omen of his imminent death.5' The generally down- to-earth character of these biographical episodes is echoed in their forthright visual representation. Pictorial spaces are articulated with horizontal and diagonal lines, either drawn or implied, which convey order and stability. The figures are fairly small and are integrated into rationally organized spaces, many of which combine outdoor settings with elements of architecture, such as courtyards, terraces, and fenced enclosures. Other scenes take place in the open countryside. Many composi- tions have a high horizon, so that the viewer looks down on the events represented. In structure, the compositions are reminiscent of textual illustrations painted at the Southern Song court, such as those for the Xiaojing and Nii xiaojing.5' Replicated and disseminated in Song and Yuan paint- ings and woodblock prints, Southern Song illustrations set the parameters of the tradition in which Ming professional painters and printmakers worked. Zhang Kai's colophon declares that his intention in compiling an illustrated biography was to promote a more accurate and deeper understanding of Confucius's life and work. As discussed above, Zhu Xi had shortened and simplified Sima Qian's account in order to create an appropriate biography for Confucius, and the revised text had become the preface to the official edition of the Lunyu. Nonetheless, Zhang believed that Zhu had overlooked certain inconsistencies and had not fully sorted out the chronology of undated incidents.53 As for Sima Qian, Zhang felt that he had recorded episodes that did not merit credence, so Zhang omitted them from his Shengji tu. Although unsettled by the thought that he dared to offer corrections to such great scholars as Sima Qian and Zhu Xi, Zhang justified his own editorial labors on the grounds that it was important to preserve a true understanding of the Confucian way, lest misconceptions lead to heterodoxy. Zhang's creation of the Shengji tu may be just an instance in which a high official supervised a pious project in order to garner prestige.54 However, it seems significant that he completed the pictorial biography exactly a year after a major confrontation between scholar-officials and Wang Zhen (d. 1449), the first of the notorious Ming eunuchs. In 1443, Wang had arrested Li Shimian (1374-I450), the chancellor of the national academy (guozijian), provoking a mass protest by the students. 55Although Li was soon released, this incident marked a serious escalation of tensions The incident is recorded by Conficius himself at the end of the Chunqiu (Spring-and-Autumn Annals); in Shiji, juan 49, 1942; and in Kongcongzi, Kong Fu, comp. (3rd c. B.C.), reprint ed. Yang Jialuo (Taibei, I962), juan I, 19ab (modern 12, upper). 2 For reproductions, see respectively Barnhart (as in note 22), and Julia K. Murray, "The Nfi hsiao ching and Southern Sung Textual Illustration: Problems of Reconstruction and Artistic Context," Ars Orientalis 18 (1988): 95-129. A Yuan popular edition of the Xiaojing is reproduced in Zhou Wu, Zhongguo banhua shi tulu (Shanghai, 1988), v. I, no. 1I15. 3 Zhang offers the following as an example of problems remaining in Zhu's rendition: How could it be possible that King Zhao of Chu had sent an envoy to visit Confucius as a sign of his favor? If this had happened, the vassal states of Chen and Cai could never have dared to ambush Confucius and threaten to starve him. 54 K. T. Wu describes this common phenomenon; see "Ming Printing and Printers," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 7.3 (February 1943): 203-6o, especially 232 and 249. This incident is analyzed in Frederick Mote and Howard L. Goodman, A Research Manualfor Ming History (Princeton, 1985). 85</page><page sequence="14">between scholar-officials and eunuchs, who were gaining power in court politics despite the Ming founder's prohibition. Set against the supposedly unprincipled conduct of eunuchs, the life of Confucius embodied the moral ideals professed by scholar-officials, to whom he was tantamount to a patron saint. Zhang Kai's compilation affirms those values in a novel and vivid way, by bringing the Sage virtually back to life through pictures. In addition, the life of Confucius offered an impli- cit standard against which the character and conduct of governmental officials might be evaluated, a matter of interest to Zhang in his capacity as surveillance official. 2. Second Recension With Zhang Kai's concise and relatively straightforward compilation as its core, the pictorial biography of Confucius became progressively more discursive and pious in its subsequent evolu- tion. The first expanded version was published in Hengzhou fu (modern Hengyang, Hunan) in 1497 by a group of officials on behalf of the recently deceased prefect of Hengzhou, He Tingrui of Runan, Henan (jinshi I457).56 According to their postface colophon, He had obtained a copy of Zhang Kai's Shengji tu containing pictures for twenty-nine episodes of Confucius's life,57 whose sources he recognized as Zhu Xi's synopsis of the "Kongzi shijia" chapter of the Shiji, the Kongzi jiayu, and Kongcongzi.58 He Tingrui had savored the pictures and Zhang's poetic eulogies with his friends and felt himself transported back to Confucius's time and place. Because the pictures were very worn and the Shengli tu was not widely known, He resolved to reprint the pictorial biography. At the same time, he took the opportunity to supplement it with episodes taken from other sources. Accordingly, he ordered an unnamed professional painter to reproduce the existing pictures and texts and to create new compositions for nine additional episodes. However, He died just as the blocks were about to be carved for the new edition, so his colleagues donated the money to complete the worthy project. They wrote prose texts for the nine added scenes but "neither could nor dared" compose zan to compete with those of Zhang Kai, who was renowned as a master of the poetic eulogy form. Although no original copy of the I497 Shengji tu has survived, it too can be reconstructed from reprint editions (further discussed in the next section), which exhibit only minor variations. The 1548 edition published by Zhu Yinyi, the Prince of Shen (d. 1549), preserves the format and contents, although not the 1497 postface colophon.59 The colophon survives in an undated edition 5 See Appendix [A-2]. He's personal name was Xun and his zi was Tingrui. A native of Luoshan, Henan, he became prefect of Hengzhou fu in 1478. During his long tenure, he oversaw the reconstruction of the Stone Drum Academy (Shigu shuyuan) and the prefectural school (fuxue). Brief biographical notices on He Xun appear in Qianlong Hengzhou fuzhi, juan 22, "minghuan" section; and Luoshan xianzhi. I am indebted to Sat6 Kazuyoshi for xeroxes of these sources. The colleagues who completed He's project were assistant prefects Gao Chang of Changshou, Xu Feng of Guixi, and Shi Yinglin of Siming, and prefectural judge Li Di ofJinhua. 57 The frontispiece portrait was not counted as an "episode" (shi). 58 The first two are discussed above and in notes 31 and 32, respectively; for Kongcongzi, see note 51. 59 There are two copies of this edition in the Beijing Library, one complete (Rare Book no. 16646; Appendix A-4; first picture reproduced in Zhonghua wuqiannian wenwu jikan, banhua bian vol. I [Taibei, I99I], z126, pl. 123), and the other missing portions of beginning and end pages (Rare Book no. 16164; Appendix A-5). The texts and pagination are placed outside the right margin of the broad, horizontal pictures. Nine pages from a third, unpaginated copy of the 1548 version (Appendix A-6), whose current whereabouts I do not know, were reproduced by Zheng Zhenduo to supplement fragmentary scenes in what he believed to be the original 1444 edition; see Zhongguo gudai banhua congkan (Shanghai, 1958). The dimensions of the printed area are given as 25 x 56 cm. by Zhou Wu (as in note 52), vol. I, no. 88, along with a reproduction of a page from this third copy. Zhu Yinyi's edition is further discussed below. 86</page><page sequence="15">published before 15o6 by Zhu Jianjun, the Prince of Ji (I456-I127),6? and in Japanese screens copied from that version.61 Like Zhang Kai's 1444 original compilation, the 1497 edition opens with a transcription of Zhu Xi's revised and annotated version of the "Kongzi shijia" chapter from the Shiji. Zhang Kai's I444 colophon is also reproduced. There are thirty-nine pictures - thirty- eight narrative illustrations plus the frontispiece portrait - and the texts are placed to the right of the pictures.6' The printed portion of each page is enclosed within a double-line frame, and a double line separates the pictures from their accompanying texts, a feature typical of early Ming printing.63 It is easy to identify the nine episodes added by He Tingrui because they lack zan, which accompany all the scenes taken from Zhang Kai's set. A zan is visually set off because it is written in indented columns following the prose passage, and spaces are left after each four-character line.64 Several of He's additions changed the character of the pictorial biography by introducing supernatural events into Zhang Kai's resolutely humanistic core cycle. Three episodes, which He took from Kongshi zuting guangji,65 drew upon imagery familiar from Buddhism and popular religion, and serve to present Confucius as a god in human guise. The Sage's conception is an- nounced by a qilin bearing an inscribed jade tablet (scene 3; fig. IO); his imminent birth is heralded by two heavenly dragons and five old men in the clouds, representing the five directions (scene 4; fig. II); and the baby is born with forty-nine unusual signs on his body,66 among them a five- character inscription on his chest, and a troupe of heavenly musicians plays while his mother holds him (scene 5; fig. I2).67 Another episode of similar character is added near the end of Confucius's life: Confucius sacrifices to the Northern Dipper (Beidou) to report that his books are completed, and in response a red rainbow suddenly radiates from the constellation and turns into an inscribed jade tablet (scene 37; fig. 13).68 All of the added scenes forcefully assert that heaven created, supported, and endorsed Confucius. The second recension of Shengfi tu was published in an era when scholar-officials were tempo- rarily ascendant over the eunuchs and had reason to hope that the Hongzhi emperor (r. I487-1505), who was unusually tolerant of Confucian admonitions, could become a model ruler. He was per- sonally devoted to Confucian ideals and had decisively repudiated the course steered by his father, 6o Copies survive in the Beijing Library (Rare Book no. 14385; Appendix A-8) and Harvard University Art Museums (acc. no. 85.536.MI.24.1971; Appendix A-9). Harvard's copy appears to have been printed at a later time from the same blocks as the Beijing example, but some of the pagination plugs had been removed and the pages are not in the same order. In both copies, there is a notation at the end of the 1497 postface, readingjifu chongkan ("republished at Jifu"), over which appears a red seal, Jifu tushu ("a Jifu book"). The Jifu edition is mentioned in a I5o6-dated colophon for the intermediary reprint (Appendix [A-3]) on which the 1548 edition was based. 61 See note 77. 62 The undated Jifu reprint (Appendix A-8, A-9) includes two additional pictures (discussed below), and the texts run along the top. The two reprints also exhibit differences in the incidental details within individual illustrations. 63 See K. T. Wu, as in note 54, P. 251. 64 The entire text accompanying the frontispiece portrait of Confucius and Yan Hui is a zan, entitled "Shu Zhongyong zan" (Encomium on Explaining the Doctrine of the Mean). 65 See note 22. The compiler, Kong Yuancuo, was the fifty-first-generation descendant of Confucius. 66 As noted previously, even Sakyamuni had only thirty-two! 67 The texts are quoted nearly verbatim, with occasional ellipses, from Kongshi zuting guangfi, juan 8 (yu 5), Ib-za. Kong Yuancuo in turn probably based his account of these incidents on the apocryphal Shiyi ji by Wang Jia (Eastern Jin), reprinted in Baibu congshu jicheng, series 9 (Taibei, 1966), juan 3, 4-5. The account is again taken nearly verbatim from Kongshi zuting guangfi,juan 9 (yu 5), I4a; Kong Yuancuo in turn may have gotten it from Soushen ji, traditionally attributed to Gan Bao (Jin), modern reprint (Beijing, 1979), I12. 87</page><page sequence="16">the Chenghua emperor (r. I464-87), whose reign had been marked by corruption, factional con- flicts, and a dramatic increase in eunuch numbers and influence. Upon taking the throne, the Hongzhi emperor had dismissed many eunuchs and irregularly recruited officials, and had pro- moted qualified individuals to key positions. Nonetheless, thousands of "good" eunuchs continued to serve and to wield influence within the palace, and factional rivalries persisted outside it.69 Moreover, the Buddhist establishment received increasingly lavish patronage from the palace over the course of the fifteenth century, and the Hongzhi emperor himself was a staunch patron.70 In this environment, it could be argued, the 1497 Shengji tu borrowed religious imagery from the competition in order to reassert the primacy of the Confucian way. a. Reprints and revised editions of the second recension The 1497 recension of the Shengji tu had a wide impact and inspired a variety of later Ming works, including illustrations in books ostensibly on other subjects, as well as paintings and printed editions explicitly entitled Shengfji tu. Their numbers suggest a surge of interest in the subject in the late Ming period, coinciding with the great expansion and diversification in publishing fostered by larger economic and social forces.7I The pictorial biography of Con- fucius offered both moral uplift and potentially entertaining storytelling, a combination that made it appeal to a range of publishers and consumers.72 Some of the later editions are substan- tially faithful to the 1497 recension in number and essential content of compositions, although there may be extensive changes in the settings and in the numbers and sizes of figures in in- dividual scenes. In addition, various levels of quality can be discerned, suggesting that Con- fucius's pictorial biography held interest for a diverse clientele. A similar diversity is also found among editions based on the third recension (see below), which was formulated in the mid- to late-sixteenth century.7' The existence of commercial reprints indicates that there was a market for the books outside the presumably non-commercial distribution network in which the versions published by officials and princes were circulated. This broadening of appeal is accom- panied by subtle changes in formats, compositions, and texts in late Ming editions, suggesting an accommodation to a variety of tastes and pocketbooks. The earliest of the extant editions based on He Tingrui's 1497 recension of the Shengfi tu was published in Jifu (modern Changsha), Hunan, the domain of the Prince ofJi (figs. 5-7, 9-14)74 69 Indeed, the colophon by He Tingrui's colleagues makes passing reference to "our clique" (wudang). For information on the period, see Frederick W. Mote, "The Ch'eng-hua and Hung-chih Reigns" in Frederick W. Mote and Denis Twitchett, eds., The Cambridge History of China, vol. 7: The Ming Dynasty, Part I (Cambridge, 1988), 343-402; and the biographies of Zhu Jianshen [the Chenghua emperor] and Zhu Youtang [the Hongzhi emperor] in Dictionary of Ming Biography, 298-304 and 375-80, respectively. 70 See Marsha Weidner, "Buddhist Pictorial Art in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644): Patronage, Regionalism, and Internationalism," in Latter Days of the Law, Marsha Weidner, ed. (Lawrence KS, and Honolulu, 1994), 51-87; esp. 56-58. 7 See Evelyn Rawski, "Economic and Social Foundations of Late Imperial Culture," in Popular Culture in Late Imperial China, edited by David Johnson et al.. (Berkeley, 1985), 3-33. 72 A striking analogy is offered by the proliferation of illustrated literature on virtuous women in the late Ming, which also combined moral instruction with entertainment; see Katherine Carlitz, "The Social Uses of Female Virtue in Late Ming Editions of Lienii zhuan," Late Imperial China 12.2 (December 1991): 117-52. 73 The appearance of a new recension did not cause earlier ones to disappear, and editions based on the earlier recensions continued to be produced. Elements introduced by a later recension sometimes infiltrated later editions of previous recensions. For example, titles for each scene emerged in the third recension, and they are incorporated into some later editions of the second recension. 74 See note 6o. 88</page><page sequence="17">Indirect evidence placing this edition in existence by 150675 allows us to identify its princely patron as Zhu Jianjun, who published several Confucian works for distribution to local scholars.76" The Jifu edition exerted great influence on the subsequent evolution of the Shengji tu theme, because it not only led directly to the third recension but also went to Japan, where it became the prototype for Japanese printed editions, as well as folding-screen paintings.77 The Jifu edition was not simply reprinted from the blocks of the 1497 set. Two pictures were added to the existing thirty-nine,7" and the accompanying texts were moved from the right side to the top, a slight change in format. The new scenes refer to Confucius's visit to the ancestral temple of Duke Huan of Lu, where he expounded an analogy between human conduct and bronze ritual containers: When the vessel has too little water, it tilts; when it is too full, it overturns; and when the water level is correct, it is upright. One picture shows Confucius accompanied by four disciples and talking with the caretaker of the temple. The other is a closeup view of three buckets suspended from wooden frames, rather like a diagrammatic illustration in an antiquarian catalogue (fig. 14). The upright vessel in the center is flanked by vessels that slant or face downward.79 Later recensions conflate the two scenes, so that Con- fucius and the caretaker are shown together with the ritual vessels.80 75 The Jifu reprint (Appendix A-8, A-9) is mentioned in a colophon of 1506 by Deng Wenzhi, which is reproduced in the 1548 edition (see note 59 and Appendix A-3 - A-7). 76 Zhu Jianjun was the seventh son of Yingzong and has a biography in Mingshi (Beijing, 1974),juan ii9, liezhuanjuan 7, modern 3637. He inherited his title in 1457 and went to his fief in 1477. His biography mentions that he published "Pictures of the Former Sage" (Xian sheng tu), probably referring to the pictorial biography of Confucius by a variant title. He also published the Book of Documents (Shangshu), producing both at the Yuelu Academy (Yuelu shuyuan) for distribution to its scholars. K. T. Wu characterizes his principality as one of the most active in reprinting existing books; see Wu (as in note 54), 238. It was not far from Hengyang, where the 1497 recension ofShengfi tu originated. 77 In Japan, the Jifu reprint not only was republished in several woodblock-printed editions (Appendix A-24 - A-27) but also was the basis for folding screens, beginning with a pair owned by Shimazu Tadayoshi (I492-1568), an important administrator of the Satsuma fief (Appendix [A-2I]). Tadayoshi kept the screens always by him for moral inspiration. Although destroyed in a fire in the late eighteenth century, they were copied by Hino Torin for the daimyj Shimazu Iehisa (1576-1638) in about 1608 (Appendix [A-22]); see Kaji (as in note 24), p. 167 and caption to the reproduction on p. 13; also Shisei Bunsen'j, compiled by the Sibunkai [Shibunkai], (Tokyo, 1938). The Jifu seal and notation are clearly visible in these reproductions. lehisa's 1608 colophon on Torin's copy described the original screens, and his colophon became more widely known through its reproduction as a foreword to the Japanese 163o (Kan'ei 78) woodblock-printed edition, entitled Koshi Seiseki no zu, of which a copy is in the Hosa Bunko (III/5; see Appendix A-24). Another pair of screens was made in 1830 and is now in the Kaseda Municipal Regional Historical Museum (Appendix A-23); see Kaji, 166-67. It is clear even from poor reproductions that the screens are extremely faithful to the Jifu reprint and preserve its text-above-picture format. Three or four episodes appear in each vertical column, and the columns are read from right to left. 78 Deng Wenzhi's 1506 colophon to an unidentified reprint of the 1497 edition (reprinted in the 1548 edition; see note 59 and Appendix items [A-3] and A-4 - A-6) states incorrectly that the Jifu edition had expanded Zhang Kai's original set to thirty- nine scenes. No doubt because Deng had not actually seen the Jifu edition, and the unknown reprint omitted the 1497 colophon, he did not realize that the two were different editions. Accordingly, he did not know that He Tingrui's edition had added nine episodes and the Jifu edition another two. 79 This picture probably was based on a very similar illustration in the Zuantu huzhu Xunzi, published in Fujian in the early thirteenth century; reproduced in Zhou Wu (as in note 52), vol. I, no. 76. A Yuan collectanea also records a painting of this subject; see Chen Lu (1288-1343), Anyatang ji, reprinted inJingyin Wenyuange Siku quanshu, jibu 152, bieji lei, no. 1213 (Taibei, I983)juan 13, 4b-5a (modern 164-65). 80 Examples of the conflated scene appear in Wu Jiamo's Kongsheng jiayu tu (discussed below; see also note 99 and Appendix items D-I - D-9), and in Xiansheng xiaoxiang (discussed below; see also note 86 and Appendix items A-Io - A-II). The conflation may have originated with a painting, now in the Kong Family Mansion, which was formerly attributed to a Ming painter named Guo Yi (and so recorded in Queli wenxian kao [as in note 5], juan 12, IIb [modern 230]) but recently published as an anonymous work; reproduced in Da zai Kongzi (as in note I), 213, and in Kongzi xiang, Yanshenggong ji furen xiaoxiang (as in note 3), pl. 2. Apparently a hanging scroll, the painting is done in ink and colors on silk and is 99.5 cm. in height and 59 cm. in width. The text of the episode is transcribed from Kongzi jiayu, juan 2, "Sanshu di jiu" (Three Ways of Reciprocity, part 9), 19. 89</page><page sequence="18">An edition of particularly high quality was published in 1548 or 1549 by Zhu Yinyi, the Prince of Shen, at his principality in Luzhou (modern Changzhi), Shanxi (figs. 8, I5).8I This edition was not made directly from the 1497 original but from a now-lost intermediate reprint, which was published in 15O6 by a Yangzhou man, who claimed direct descent from Confucius and evidently intended his project to substantiate that connection.8' Despite the intervening edition, Zhu Yinyi's production was more faithful to He Tingrui's recension than the Jifu edition, in terms of the number of scenes and the relationship between text and painting. How- ever, the pictures themselves were much more elaborate than He Tingrui's are likely to have been, judging from the compositions in the Jifu edition. Zhu Yinyi's landscape backgrounds are more extensive, with minutely detailed textures, and the figures are delineated with greater sophistication. In several instances, outdoor scenes are replaced with architectural settings. For example, in the scene where the Big Dipper emits a rainbow, plain tables and outdoor screen (fig. 13) have been replaced by an elaborately furnished courtyard bordered by railings and buildings (fig. 15). And in the last scene, illustrating Han Gaozi's sacrifice at the ancestral temple of Confucius, the modest shrine in the countryside has become a grand temple (fig. 8). Changes of this type reflect mid-sixteenth century tastes and ambiance, and it is likely that they were made for Zhu Yinyi's edition rather than the I5yo6 reprint. From comments in Zhu Yinyi's postface colophon, it may be surmised that he published his edition in order to enhance his reputation as a staunch, cultivated Confucian, worthy of a princely title. His accession had been controversial, because the rightful heir in his generation had died in 1530 without a son, and the Jiajing emperor had made Zhu Yinyi the acting administrator of the realm (shefu). However, two other princes joined forces to protest the appointment, and it was another ten years before the emperor punished them and formally invested Zhu with the princely title. In the spring of 1548, a local scholar presented an old copy of Shengji tu (i.e., the now-lost 15o6 reprint of the 1497 edition), and the prince took the opportunity to make a public display of his Confucian piety by having the work beautifully recarved for wider distribution.83 In addition to these two princely editions based on the 1497 second recension ofShengfi tu, there are several late Ming editions published in smaller, less expensive formats and lower in artistic quality. Their existence indicates a market for the pictorial biographies that was served by commercial publishers, whose reprints were based on the more exclusive editions. Among late Ming commercial reprints, the best known today is one whose publisher presented it as none other than Zhang Kai's original I444 edition, because it reproduces only Zhang's colo- phon and transcription of Zhu Xi's revised and annotated Shiji "Shijia" with the pictures. This deception fooled even the modern bibliophile Zheng Zhenduo, who included it as Zhang Kai's 8 Zhu Yinyi, a sixth-generation descendant of Taizu, was enfeoffed as Shenwang in 1526; see Mingren zhuanji ziliao suoyin, comp. Taiwan National Central Library (reprint Beijing, 1987), 134; also Mingshi, juan 118 (zhuwang 3), 3606. His postface colophon is signed with the sobriquet Nanshanzi. For information on his edition of the Shengji tu, see note 59. 8 Cf. Appendix [A-3]. The information is in a postface colophon by Deng Wenzhi, the prefect of Yangzhou, which was reprinted with the 1548 edition ofZhu Yinyi. 3 Public demonstrations of Confucian piety were increasingly common in late Ming as a strategy for wealthy gentry to maintain elite status; see Timothy Brook, Praying for Power: Buddhism and the Formation of Gentry Society in Late-Ming China (Cambridge, MA., 1993), esp. I3-zo20 and 23-29. 90</page><page sequence="19">original edition in his monumental compendium of woodblock printing, Zhongguo gudai banhua congkan (fig. I6).84 To make the transition from a large album format to the smaller one of a book, the wide compositions had to be reduced and modified. Usually, the pictures were spread across the gutter of the book. Depending on how the pages were bound, the right and left halves of a facing-page spread might not be printed from the same woodblock. As a result, halves of pictures are sometimes missing. For example, nine illustrations in the copy reproduced by Zheng Zhenduo are fragmentary. Even more striking, a commercial reprint now in the Har- vard-Yenching Library was bound carelessly, causing several page spreads to be mismatched, such that the right and left halves belong to different compositions.85 b. A reprint in different guise The second-recension Shengji tu also served as the basis for at least one work that appeared in the late Ming under a variant title and in different packaging. In 1598, Liu Shuangsong of the Anzhengtang published scaled-down and simplified renditions of the Shengji tu compositions and texts in a single, small volume, entitled Xiansheng xiaoxiang (fig. I7).86 A similarly conceived companion volume, entitled Mengzi quantu, presented twenty-one pictures and texts on the life of Mencius. Each illustration occupies three-quarters of a two-page spread, and the accompanying text is placed in the last quadrant at left. The Shengji tu's wide compositions have been creatively adapted to the much smaller format by replacing small figures and landscape panoramas with closeup scenes of large, finely drawn figures in streamlined, shallow settings. This combination of vivid figures and truncated space focuses the viewer's attention on the human interactions and drama of the events depicted. The two-volume set forms a personal-sized, inspirational "Illustrated Lives of the Founders of Confucianism," which seems well suited to private contemplation. 84 Zheng's notes on the book and related editions appear in a postface. The edition was owned by Zheng and is now in the Beijing Library (Rare Book no. 16645; Appendix A-7). 8 T I786.2/1346B (Appendix A-16). There are four- or five-character titles on these pictures, and Zhang Kai's zan have been dropped. Both elements point to influence from the third recension of the mid-sixteenth century (discussed below). The Yenching copy has been hand-punctuated in red, indicating that the owner did not consider it an object for aesthetic contemplation, but rather, a book to read. Better copies of this edition, which do not have mismatched pages and are more complete, are in the Beijing Library, Beihai branch (zhuan 50/16.12) and Marquand Library, Princeton University (ND Io43.Sz SA); see also Appendix A-I5. It is possible that they are reprints of the high-quality Chongzhen-era edition of Lii Weichi (1587-1641) mentioned by Zheng Zhenduo (see note 84). Lii also published Shengxian xiangzan in 1632, which is not a pictorial biography but a series of iconic portraits and eulogies for Confucius, his disciples, and canonized later Confucians (through Wang Yangming). The publisher's name and date, and the outer title Kong Meng xiang tu zan appear on a copy in the Nagoya Hosa Bunko (161/10; Appendix A-Io), of which one page is reproduced by Kaji (as in note 24), 24. The work has thirty-nine pictures and belongs to the lineage of the Jifu edition (see above, and note 6o). The Anzhengtang was a high-quality commercial publisher in Jianyang, Fujian, which was active under several generations of the Liu family for over one hundred years, from about 1500oo; see K. T. Wu (as in note 54), 235. A late Ming commercial reprint of this work, in the National Central Library, Taiwan (Rare Book no. 2667; Appendix A- II), has no information concerning author, publisher, or date of publication, and no outer title, preface or colophon. In addition to being printed on poor quality paper, the NCL copy has been hand-punctuated in red ink and portions of a few pictures amateurishly colored in, indicating that the book's owner(s) did not consider it a precious treasure. The book also shows influence from by-then widely circulated publications based on the third recension (discussed below; also Appendix, items under B), because there is a single conflated scene (H6sa scene 36, NCL scene 35) showing Confucius in the temple of Duke Huan of Qi, discussing water levels in three ritual vessels; see discussion on p. 89ff. 91</page><page sequence="20">3. Third recension: the major expansion The various sets of illustrations described up to this point all are comparatively close to Zhang Kai's original 1444 edition of Shengji tu, albeit with the additions and modifications noted. By contrast, the third major recension of the Shengji tu enlarged the pictorial biography to at least seventy scenes and changed its character from a reasonably concise biography/hagiography, with a sustained narrative momentum, to a slower-moving and more discursive compendium of events that included several posthumous episodes in the development of the cult of Confucius. Although no original edition of this expanded set appears to survive, its formulation in the mid to late six- teenth century (before 1587) may be deduced from several kinds of evidence: a later commercial reprint called Shengji quantu (Complete Pictures of the Sage's Traces);87 an excerpt published in 1589 by Wu Jiamo of Wulin (Hangzhou) as part of his Kongsheng jiayu tu (see next section); and records concerning the sources of the fourth recension of 1592 (discussed below). For convenience, I will refer to the third recension as Shengfi quantu. Besides enlarging the pictorial cycle with new episodes, Shengfi quantu introduced changes that made Confucius even more perfect a sage and moral exemplar. For example, the legend of his birth was tidied up, as depicted in the second illustration (fig. 18), which is entitled "Praying for an heir at Niqiu" (Niqiu daosi). Instead of Confucius's mother praying alone on the mountaintop, both parents are present, and it is the father who takes the lead in beseeching the spirits for a son. Although many decades older than his wife, he is depicted as a man of middle age, and the scene seems intended to counter any notion that the Sage's parentage was less than ideal.88 Other 87 I have examined a complete copy in the Beijing Library, Beihai branch (zhuan 5o/16.15; Appendix A-15) and a fragmentary one in the Harvard-Yenching Library (TI786.z/I346D; Appendix A-16). The title Shengfi quantu, possibly an abbreviation, appears only as a running head in the margin of each page. The book opens with the Kangxi emperor's four zan for the Four Correlates (Yan Hui, Zengzi, Zisi, and Mengzi) and his epithet for Confucius, Wanshi shibiao, followed by a detailed table of contents. Next come seventy biographical pictures, then iconic representations and short biographies of the Four Correlates. The remainder of the book is given over to poems and eulogies for Confucius from the Tang through Ming periods, and a transcript of Shao Yiren's statement (see note 118) on the 1592 stone tablets in the Temple of Confucius at Qufu (see below). Although the work must have been published after 1684, when the Kangxi emperor visited Qufu and bestowed his epithet on Confucius, the pictures themselves appear to be Ming in date. The character qiu, which appears on the second illustration, is not modified to observe the strict taboo instituted at the start of the Qing dynasty by the Shunzhi emperor (r. 1644-61; see Cihai p. 36, under "qiu"). Moreover, the frontispiece to the iconic opening portrait of Confucius identifies him as "Ultimate Sage and Foremost Teacher," his designation between 1529 and 1645. It is possible that the pictures were reprinted from old woodblocks kept in Qufu and the other material assembled around this nucleus. The seventy scenes themselves probably were a subset of the original expansion, because they do not include five that appear in An Mengsong's Kongsheng quanshu of 1599 (see note Iog), which also used pictures from the third recension. A similar set of seventy pictures was published again in 1826 by Gu Yuan as an appendix to his Shengmiao sidian tudkao (Appendix B-4). A note in Gu's table of contents identifies them as coming from "an old edition" (guben), and Peng Xizheng's preface says it was published by the late Ming Hangzhou bookseller Hu Wenhuan (zi Defu, haoQuanan,Ji ca. 1596; mentioned in Dictionary of Ming Biography, p. 1297 and K. T. Wu [as in note 54]). Gu Yuan's pictures circulated widely and later served as the inspiration for the colored illustrations reproduced by Henri Dore in Recherches sur les Superstitions en Chine (Shanghai, 1918), part 3, vol. 13. Shengji quantu, 2b-3a. Shuliang He was a soldier in his seventies and Confucius's mother, Yan Zhengzai, was a poor young woman. Sima Qian characterizes their union as yehe ("informally joined" - i.e., without proper rituals), a comment that Zhu Xi deleted; see Shiji, juan 47, 1905. In any event, Ms. Yan was not Shuliang He's principal wife. The claim that both parents prayed together on Mount Ni was made by Kong Yuancuo (see note zz22), juan 9, Izb. Ritual attention was directed to Confucius's father, Shuliang He, during the Jiajing period, when the emperor ordered shrines built to the fathers of Confucius and three of his disciples; see Dictionary of Ming Biography, 3Zo-z21; also Kongzhai zhi (as in note 47), juan 2, za-b (modern, 231-32). The writers quoted in the latter professed ignorance of any earlier history of such temples. During the Great Rites Controversy, the Jiajing emperor had insisted upon official ritual expression of filial piety toward his own natural father (see note Io) and thereafter was sensitive to matters involving fathers. 92</page><page sequence="21">episodes added to the core group provide additional testimony for Confucius's superior wisdom, such as the scene in which Confucius viewed the didactic murals of wise and evil rulers of antiquity in the Zhou mingtang and pondered the lessons of the past for the present.89 Toward the end of the Shengji quantu there are several new illustrations that expand upon events involving the grave, former residence, and ancestral temple of Confucius in Qufu. By contrast, Zhang Kai's I444 set had included only two scenes beyond the time of Confucius's death, one showing the disciples mourning, and the other Han Gaozu's sacrifice in the ancestral temple of Confucius. Between these events, the third recension inserts a dramatic representation of the anti-Confucian emperor Qin Shihuang's visit to Qufu and alleged desecration of Confucius's grave, which exposed a tablet inscribed with a rhymed prediction of the tyrant's own imminent death.90 This episode signifies heaven's condemnation of immoral actions, and its inclusion may have been intended as an oblique criticism of the autocratic Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1525-82). Zhang had been so zealous to maintain control and ensure that his fiscal reforms became established that he had violated ritual propriety by remaining in office after his father died in 1577, instead of withdrawing to observe the prescribed twenty-seven months of mourning.9' The likelihood that he was the intended target of the desecration scene is strengthened by its omission from the fourth recension of Shengji tu, which was formulated in 1591-92 (see below), some ten years after the controversial Grand Secretary had died.9' Following the scene of Han Gaozu's sacrifice, with which the earlier recensions had concluded, the Shengji quantu illustrates three other events of the Han period: the discovery of Old Text edi- tions of the classics in the wall of Confucius's house; the unearthing of jade slabs and an urn (with another portentous inscription) that had belonged to Confucius, during repairs to the temple; and the planting of a juniper tree on the temple grounds.93 Besides emphasizing the Qufu setting, these episodes bear on the history of the cult and the development of its mystique. The final scene of the Shengji quantu leaps ahead to the year Ioo8, when Song Zhenzong made his pilgrimage to Qufu and bestowed new titles on Confucius, his disciples, and his descendants.94 This episode commemorates the apogee of imperial recognition and favorable treatment of the cult, concluding the pictorial biography on the high note of apotheosis. After the illustrations of these major events in the development of the cult, the Shengji quantu incorporates a section on the Four Correlates (sipei), the canonized chief followers of Confucius: Yan Hui, Zengzi, Zisi, and Mengzi. Each man is depicted in an iconic portrait and provided with 8 Shengfi quantu, 16b-I7a; based on Kongzi jiayu, juan 3, 2z5-26. This scene did not persist into the fourth recension (Appendix, C- I), nor was it selected by Wu Jiamo for Kongsheng jiayu tu (Appendix, items under D); see discussion below. 90 Shengii quantu, 65b-66a. The desecration is referred to by Kong Yuancuo (as in note zz22; juan 9, 17), but instead of an inscription inside the tomb, he says there was a white rabbit. 91 For a vivid account, see Ray Huang, -587, A Year of No Significance (New Haven &amp; London, 1981), 21-24. 92 The scene may also evoke an incident during the Jiajing period, in which grave robbers were frightened off by supernatural occurrences while they were attempting to plunder a burial site in Qingpu near Songjiang, where Confucius's clothing and jades were presumed to be buried; see Kongzhai zhi (as in note 47), juan I, 3b (modern z218). 9 Shengji quantu, 67b-70a. The discovery of the old texts is credited to Kong Anguo, a twelfth-generation descendant of Confucius, and is summarized by Kong Yuancuo (as in note zz22), juan 6, Ib. The tale of the jade slabs and urn also comes from Kong Yuancuo (juan 9, IIa-b). The juniper scene is accompanied by a text that says this tree was planted in the Yuan period to replace one that had been destroyed by fire long ago. The first two scenes were omitted from the fourth recension of 1592 (Appendix C-I), and the third was dropped in later reprints based on that (Appendix, items under C). 94 Shengji quantu, 70b-71a. The occasion is described in Kongshi zuting guangji (as in note zz22), juan 4, za-3a; it is more tersely recorded in Toqto et al., Songshi (Beijing, 1977),juan 7,138-39. The illustration was retained in later recensions. 93</page><page sequence="22">a biographical sketch. In the Dachengdian, the main building in the Qufu temple, sculptural icons of the four men were attendant upon the icon of Confucius and received sacrifices according to a regular schedule. The inclusion of their images in Shengfi quantu emphasizes the Qufu ambi- ance of the book, because Confucian temples elsewhere had been obliged to replace all icons with tablets. Thus, Shengji quantu draws firmly together two aspects of the cult of Confucius that pre- viously had been somewhat separate: reverence for Confucius as the cultural paragon delineated in the Shengji tu's biographical pictures, and worship of Confucius as the sage-deity enshrined in temples to receive sacrifices. The Shengji quantu's attention to the development of the cult stands in striking contrast to the first and second recensions, whose emphasis is more narrowly biographical. If the new direction indicates more than just the likelihood that the book was compiled in Qufu, perhaps by the Kong family, it may also be a subtle protest against the ritual changes of 1530, which had removed icons from most Confucian temples and lowered the honorific titles held by Confucius and his disciples.95 The cumulative effect of the work suggests that it was compiled in an atmosphere of competition, not only concerning factional positions on rituals and morality, but also financial support. In the late sixteenth century, members of the imperial family and scholar-gentry alike increased their patronage of a reinvigorated Buddhist establishment, to the disadvantage of the state cult.96 Unfortunately, the reprint edition of Shengii quantu has no prefaces or other documen- tation that might substantiate these possibilities or link the original compilation with specific individuals. However, from Wu Jiamo's comments (see next section), it is clear that it was circu- lated in Qufu and probably originated there. In format, the third recension changed the dimensions and presentation of the illustrations in ways that enable the viewer to experience the pictures in the manner of reading a book, as opposed to viewing an album or portfolio. Each illustration was given a four-character descriptive title for convenient identification97 and was made to fit the narrow vertical format of a single verso page, and the text occupied a single recto page.98 The pictures themselves look more contemporary, with settings whose incidental details reflect late Ming material culture, such as decorated screens and tables of antiques. The texts were rendered less austerely classical than those in the first and second recensions by the addition of occasional background information, explanations, and cita- tions of authority. A zan was supplied for each episode, either Zhang Kai's or an anonymous one for scenes that had not been part of Zhang Kai's original group. As a whole, the Shengji quantu is an accessible and inspirational compendium of pictures and texts, which affirms the life of Con- fucius as the model for the aspiring sage and validates the state cult as a institution. Far from diluting this message, the quantity of episodes makes it all the more emphatic. 95 See earlier discussion on p. 76. 96 See Brook (as in note 83), esp. Chapter 9 and Conclusion. 97 It seems to have been something of a fad in the late Ming period to write titles directly on paintings in albums or sectional handscrolls, often using a slightly archaic script for decorative effect. It would be very worthwhile to study the origins and implications of this practice, as well as its relationship to illustrated printed books. 98 In the commercial reprint (Appendix B-2, B-3), the text is on the recto of the page following and facing the verso that displayed the picture, so the two had to be printed on separate blocks in order to appear side by side when the book was bound. By contrast, Wu Jiamo's publication (Appendix D-I - D-9) has picture and text carved on the same block, so that when the printed sheet was subsequently folded for binding, they became the recto and verso of the same page and could not be viewed simultaneously. 94</page><page sequence="23">a. WuJiamo's Kongsheng jiayu tu (1589)99 The third recension of the Shengji tu was the source for the forty pictures used by an otherwise unrecorded scholar named Wu Jiamo to embellish his publication of the Kongzi jiayu (fig. I9).Ioo As noted previously, thejiayu had fallen out of favor during the Song and virtually dis- appeared until the sixteenth century, when it was reprinted in numerous editions.?o' Wu Jiamo's Kongsheng jiayu tu combined a text of thefiayu, borrowed from the descendants of Wang Ao (I45o-1524), with pictures obtained in Qufu in 1587 by Wu's teacher, Yang Shi- jing.Ioz To enhance the stature of his compilation, Wu reprinted Wang Ao's preface from the borrowed copy of the jiayu and solicited a second preface from the eminent Wang Shizhen (1526-90).1o3 Wu Jiamo's own preface presents an impassioned case for expanding the official curriculum to embrace the Jiayu, a broadening he considered vital because the civil service examination curriculum did not include the entire corpus of Confucian texts (not to mention non-Confucian books). As he notes, the Jiayu contained additional teachings of Confucius, and its text was largely consistent with the pictorial account presented in the Shengji tu.I'04 Wu was convinced that his united presentation of Confucius's words and deeds would enable people to experience the Sage vividly, even though he was long gone from the world. Wu's desire to give tangible form to the life of the great paragon of moral self-cultivation suggests sympathies with fun- damentalist political reformers, such as those who later were associated with the Donglin movement. IO5 The entire first juan of Kongsheng jiayu tu consists of forty pictures that are closely dependent upon forty from Shengji quantu, along with their four-character titles, which Wu altered slightly to make them more literary. His selection of pictures exhibits a more strictly 99 I have examined eight copies of this book, which exists in both its original edition and several commercial reprints. Copies of the original edition are in the National Central Library, Taiwan (Rare Book no. 5326; [Appendix D-I]) and Beijing Library (Rare Book no. 11054; [Appendix D-2]). Commercial reprints of varying levels of quality include three others in the National Central Library (Rare Books nos. 5327, 5328, and 5330; [Appendix D-3 - D-5]), all from different editions; two in the Harvard- Yenching Library (Tio75/234o and To1075/2340 c. 2; [Appendix D-6, D-7]) from the same edition; and one in the Seikad6 Bunko (44-27; (Appendix D-8). I was unable to examine a copy in the Beihai branch of the Beijing Library (zhe 122zz/768; [Appendix D-9]). Further information on reprint editions is given in Zhou Wu, Huipai banhua shi lunji (Hofei: Anhui Renmin, 1983), 55, notes to pl. 17. I00 Wu Jiamo does not appear in standard biographical references, and information on his life and preoccupations must be deduced from the Kongsheng jiayu tu itself. His preface states that he spent the year 1588 collating the Kongzi jiayu and checking its information against that of a book entitled Kongzi quanshu, which probably refers to the ambitious compendium published in 1583 by Cai Fu (of which a 1608 reprint is in the Naikaku Bunko, call no. 287/66). This is not the same as the eponymous work compiled by An Mengsong and commercially published in 199; see note lo9 and Appendix E-I. iox See Kramers (as in note 32), 38-41. A 1554 facsimile reprint of a Song edition is discussed by K. T. Wu (as in note 54), 2z2z. 02oz Yang's postscript to Kongsheng jiayu tu says nothing about giving a copy of Shengji tu to Wu Jiamo; instead Yang rambles patronizingly about how well Wu Jiamo understood classical texts and how devoted he was to Confucian learning. I have not been able to find biographical information about Yang. The signature on his postscript proclaims that he was a scholar of Renhe (Zhejiang), and Wu Jiamo mentions what may be a studio name, Dansuo. 103 Wang Shizhen's preface is largely devoted to the jiayu and offers perfunctory praise for Wu Jiamo's enterprise only in conclusion. 104 It is implied that the authority of the pictures was beyond question because they came from Qufu itself, legitimized by association with the sage's hometown. Not only was Qufu the center of Confucius's imperially sponsored cult, it was also the location of an extensive Kong family archive. '05 For the Donglin movement, see Ray Huang, "Lung-ch'ing and Wan-li Reigns, 1567-I620," in The Cambridge History of China, vol. 7: The Ming Dynasty, Part I (Cambridge, 1988), 511-84 and esp. 532-48; Charles Hucker, "The Tung-lin Movement of the Late Ming Period" in John K. Fairbank, ed., Chinese Thought and Institutions (Chicago, 1964), 132-62; and Heinrich Busch, "The Tung-lin Academy and its Political and Philosophical Significance," Monumenta Serica 14 (1949-55): 1-163. 95</page><page sequence="24">biographical focus and greater interest in moving the narrative forward. Probably for that reason, he eliminated the zan and annotated many of the texts with additional factual details, such as the date of each incident, which he identified by the year in the Zhou king's reign as well as that of the local ruler in whose state it occurred. Wu also appended his own sometimes extensive comments, introduced by the word an ("in my opinion").Io6 Moreover, he gave the texts greater visual importance by placing them on the recto pages preceding their respective illustrations, which follow on the verso pages. Encountering the text before seeing the picture, the reader was thus encouraged to focus on the didactic lesson of each episode. The compen- dium is more appropriately described as an illustrated book than a set of annotated pictures. Unlike most other publications of the Shengji tu, whose artists and block-carvers are anonymous, Kongsheng jiayu tu prominently acknowledges two of the craftsmen involved in the production. The first picture (fig. 19) bears the signature and alternate name of the artist, Cheng Qilong (zi, Boyang) of Xindu (Anhui),1o7 who made subtle changes in the received scenes that intensified their contemporary ambiance and elevated their artistic quality from routine to outstanding. The blockcarver, Huang Zu, signed the first page of the book as well as the first picture. The Huang family of southern Anhui produced many high-quality publica- tions, which were much sought-after in the late Ming period.8os The Anhui provenance of Wu Jiamo's original edition is clearly announced by the crisp, sharp lines of the printing and fine white paper. In having his book produced by craftsmen of a high level, Wu revealed his ambi- tion to create a work of art that would demonstrate his refined taste as well as his Confucian piety. The several commercial reprints of this book that soon appeared took shortcuts in quality, as well as making other modifications to adapt the book to less discriminating customers who wanted a cheaper edition.I?9 b. A late Ming illustrated drama The illustrated edition of a late Ming southern drama (chuanqi) reproduces another selection of pictures, some of which were inspired by the Shengji quantu or the more widely available Kongsheng jiayu tu. The work is entitled Xinbian Kongfuzi zhouyou lieguo dacheng qilin ji (Newly Compiled Record of Master Kong's Travels around all the States, Fulfilling the Qilin), and it io6 His opinions reveal him to be something of a prim and proper moralist. His note to the first episode offers a good example: While acknowledging that old texts mentioned only that Confucius's mother had gone to the hilltop to pray, Wu rationalizes that the father must have been there too, because it would have been improper for a woman to go out alone! 107 He also illustrated Huang Shangwen's Ni'fan bian (1602; later retitled Gujin Guifan); see K. T. Wu (as in note 54), pl. 7. 108 For a convenient overview of their publications, see Zhou Wu (as in notes 52 and 99); also Oki Yasushi, Minmatsu Konan ni okeru shuppan bunka no kenkyu (Hiroshima, I99I), 63 ff. Some twenty-four successive leaders of the Huang workshop have been identified, and it also had branches in other regions. lo9 For commercial reprints of Wu Jiamo's book, see note 99 and Appendix items D-3 - D-9. Besides differences in the kind of paper used and the degree of care taken in the printing process itself, the commercial editions sometimes made slight changes in the four-character titles. Wu's book also was the source for the preface and some of the text in Xinqie taige qing'e buzhu Kongzi jiayu, a Wanli-period commercial publication by Liu Longtian of the Qiaoshantang (Appendix D-io). The fifteen pictures in this book, however, were excerpted from An Mengsong's Kongsheng quanshu (1599), a compendium of writings about or associated with Confucius. Several copies of An's book survive (Appendix EI-E3). The relationship between An Mengsong's and Wu Jiamo's books is unclear: fourteen of the nineteen illustrations in An's book seem to be based on Wu's; two more appear in Shengji quantu, and three are unique to An's book. Apart from the four-character titles written directly on the pictures, there is no text imme- diately associated with the illustrations. 96</page><page sequence="25">r :r Fig. I Full-length portrait of Confucius (3/4 view), traditionally attributed to Wu Daozi, Tang dynasty, rubbing of incised stone tablet, Qufu.</page><page sequence="26">.r .; ., . . , - . 4 Al 'o.

An imaginative and entertaining play about the life of Confucius, it is replete with populist elements and unblushing anachronisms that transport the subject into the world of late Ming romantic drama. The text is permeated with popular beliefs and references to Daoist deities (even the Jade Emperor), and the pictures are similar in style and spirit to those in other late Ming illustrated plays. The work begins with nineteen illustrations carved by one Suming, whose signature appears on the last picture."' All but the first occupy a single recto or verso page. More "theatrical" than other sets of biographical pictures, these display gesticulating figures and shallow stage- like scenery, and the settings and costumes vividly convey a late Ming ambiance. The double- width opening scene shows Confucius's father and mother praying for a son, no longer on a lonely hilltop but in a prosperous temple (fig. 2o). Inside, a pair of demons guard the shrine containing an anthropomorphic image of the spirit of Nishan (called Nishan zhishen in the play script),I12 behind an altar table set with sacrificial offerings. The supplicant couple are dressed in the garb of the official elite and kneel reverently, while a functionary reads a scroll containing their petition to the deity. Confucius's father is also conspicuously present in the following scene, in which the qilin brings the tidings that leave Ms. Yan pregnant; in fact, it is Shuliang He who receives the jade tablet from the fabulous beast.'13 In the third scene, he stands next to mother and baby, acknowledging the auspicious manifestations of dragons, directional gods, and heavenly musicians. These first three illustrations affirm the dignity and decorum of Confucius's family background, portraying it as one appropriate to a great sage. Other illustrations summarize the dramatic high points of the narrative or portray Confu- cius in situations that establish his character. Immediately after the scene of his birth, he is shown with his wife and son entertaining his parents, then editing the classics, and teaching his disciples. Later illustrations single out a few lurid events in his official career (the execution of Shao Zhengmao, the debauched revelry of Duke Ding of Lu with the women sent as a gift from Qi), the perils of his travels on the road (tigers,-hostile armies), and other well-known incidents (Zilu asking the way to the ford, Confucius lamenting the dead qilin). Some compositions bear I1o The pseudonym seems to be a parody on Yanshenggong ("Duke of Extended Sagehood"), the official title bestowed on the leader of each generation of Confucius's descendants. According to Timothy Brook, lesser literati conventionally adopted "religious-sounding pseudonyms" when writing for commercial publication aimed at a popular audience, thereby conferring greater prestige on their work; see Geographical Sources of Ming-Qing History (Ann Arbor, 1988), 16. Alternatively, the author of the play may have hidden behind a pseudonym because he could have been punished if the play were judged irreverent to Confucius. It has also been suggested that a member of the Kong family wrote the play; see Kongzi da cidian, Zhang Dainian, ed., (Shanghai, 1993), 423. The use of the character huan in the hao of members of the sixty-fifth generation lends support to this possibility. The text of the play is divided into thirty-nine scenes (chu), containing narration, dialogue, and songs. I examined a late Ming edition in the National Palace Museum Library (Rare Book no. 2761; Appendix F-I). A reprint of the work is available in the series Quan Ming chuanqi, Zhongguo xiju yanjiu ziliao, diyi ji (Taibei, 1983), but the reproduction quality is atrocious. Although the best-known southern dramas were about love affairs, some were written to promote orthodox morality and political values; see William Dolby, A History of Chinese Drama (London, 1976), 77 and 88. Unidentified. The signature inscription reads "Suming carved the images" (Suming ke xiang) and is accompanied by a seal reading "Seal of Suming" (Suming yin). Unlike the block-carver, the artisan who designed the compositions lacked the prestige to get his name on the product. The deity of Nishan had been granted the title Sage-Nurturing Marquis (Yushenghou) by Song Renzong in lo5o; see Kong Yuancuo (as in note 22), juan 9, I2b. 113 In no other representation of this episode is any man present. Iog</page><page sequence="38">four-character titles that resemble but usually are not identical to corresponding titles in either the Shengji quantu or Kongsheng jiayu tu. Virtually all of the figures who are depicted have speaking roles in the script, starting with often folksy self-introductions when they arrive onstage and continuing with blow-by-blow comments on what they are doing. Every attempt is made to endow events and personalities with dramatic interest, sometimes catering to fairly lowbrow humor. Moreover, the addition of human-interest scenes, such as Confucius with his family and the birth of his grandson, suggests a broadening of popular appeal. The language is accessible to readers of moderate literacy and requires no classical erudition; at the same time, occasional quotes from the Shijing provide a whiff of cultivation. The combination suggests that the target audience for the illustrated chuanqi was neither the highly-educated elite nor the unlettered rustic, but readers somewhere between these extremes. 4. Fourth recension: enshrinement in the temple The fourth recension of the Shengji tu, which quickly became authoritative, is the set of illustra- tions carved on stone tablets in 1592 for display in the Temple of Confucius at Qufu (fig. 2I).II The creation of this set added a new dimension to the experience of visiting the temple and publicly affiliated the pictorial biography with the imperially sponsored sacrificial cults of Confucius, both the state cult and the ancestral cult maintained by his descendants. The installation of the picto- rial biography in the one Confucian temple that still had sculptural icons clearly implies that narrative pictures were more than just surrogates for the icons abolished from other temples. Al- though the iconoclasm of 153o had stimulated the popularity and production of pictorial biographies in the later sixteenth century, there also were qualities inherent in pictorial narration that greatly augmented the appeal of such pictures. Far more than the icons whose disappearance they had partially offset, the biographical illustrations engaged a viewer's interest by depicting an unfolding plot, which was both instructional and inspirational. The enshrinement of a pictorial biography of Confucius in the Qufu temple officially acknowledged the suasive power of pictorial narrative at the same time that it codified a particular conception of the Sage's life. The one hundred twelve scenes represented on the stone tablets constitute the largest expansion of Confucius's biographical series.II5 In all likelihood, pictures from the third recension 114 Appendix C-I. A complete set of rubbings of the stone tablets was collected by Berthold Laufer between 1901-04 and is now in the Field Museum (acc. nos. 244657a-h [texts] and 244658.1-112 [illustrations]). Laufer's numbering system suggests that by the early twentieth century the tablets were no longer in the original order, which can be reconstructed using the numbers carved in the lower right corners of the tablets themselves (which the Field Museum used to reorganize Laufer's rubbings and assign accession numbers). Laufer's order coincides exactly with the listing made slightly later by Baba Harukichi (see note 5, 169-70), and the tablets are still installed in this revised order. I have not been able to determine when the sequence of scenes was changed, but perhaps it occurred during an early nineteenth-century renovation of the building; see the "Stele on the Rebuilding of the Shengjidian" (Chongxiu Shengfidian bei, 1806), in Sun Yonghan and Li Jingye, comps., Xinxiu Qufu xianzhi (1948), reprinted in Zhongguo fangzhi congshu, Huabei difang, no. 19 (Taibei, 1982), juan 8, 26b-28a (modern 888-91). For further discussion of the Qufu temple set, see my article, "The Temple of Confucius and Pictorial Biographies of the Sage," The journal of Asian Studies 55 no. 2 (May 1996): 269-300. 115 Here I exclude the two hundred thirty-five-scene Xinqie Kongsheng zongshi chushen quanzhuan (Appendix G-i), a popular history whose pictures are unrelated to those in the Shengji tu lineage. Probably published in the latter half of the sixteenth century, the book features small pictures above a continuous text, a format that began with Song and Yuan pinghua illustrated books and continued to be used by Fukienese commercial publishers; see W. L. Idema, "Some Remarks and Speculations Concerning P'ing-hua," T'oung Pao 6o (1974): 121-72. The compositions are extremely schematic, usually showing no more than a couple of figures and perhaps a prop or building, and the interactions are so "generic" that few could be identified without the IIO</page><page sequence="39">formed the core of the new set, but many third-recension scenes were omitted and a large number of episodes were illustrated for the first time."I The enlargement and elaboration of the biogra- phical cycle with additional episodes continued the trend away from Zhang Kai's originally concise tour of the highlights of Confucius's life. Many scenes are generic depictions of encounters between the ever-serious Confucius and an assortment of other people, including teachers, rulers, brigands, disciples, etc. Some compositions lack motifs that would readily identify the episode, thus requiring the viewer to refer to the text in order to know for certain what is represented. The text for each scene is written for the first time inside the compositional frame, following the four- character title.I7 This encroachment of text onto pictorial image suggests influence from the es- thetics of literati painting, in which it was conventional to write directly on a picture. In content, the texts are simplified somewhat from the classical sources and, more importantly, the zan have been discarded. According to contemporary accounts of the project,II8 the idea for this new set was conceived by the censor He Chuguang (jinshi 1583), while he was serving as the Regional Inspector for Shandong (Shandong xun'an yushi).`9 He was concerned that the woodblocks for printing illustrations of the life of Confucius not only were physically vulnerable but also were scattered throughout the temple. Accordingly, he raised funds to have pictures carved on stone tablets for preservation and display in a new building, called the Shengjidian (Hall of the Sage's Traces), which was erected on a vacant lot at the rear of the temple complex.I"? The work was overseen by the district magistrate of Qufu, Kong Hongfu, a sixty-first-generation descendant of Confucius.", In the tenth month of accompanying labels. These variations on a few simple schemes follow pinghua conventions, and the illustrations probably evolved independently of the Shengii tu. 116 By comparison with the seventy scenes in the commercial reprint called Shengfi quantu (see above; Appendix B-2, B-3), fifteen scenes were omitted and some fifty-seven new ones were added. However, as previously mentioned, Shengji quantu itself may not reproduce all the pictures in the now-lost original edition of the third recension (Appendix [B-I]). u17 In the third recension (Appendix, items under B), only the four-character title appeared within the picture, and the body of text was outside it, in a separate frame. One painted handscroll (Appendix A-I9) has texts and titles written directly on the pictures, while two painted albums (Appendix A-17 and [A-I8]) have texts without titles; see p. II7--off. 118 Valuable documentary information is preserved in two accounts composed late in 1592 and carved to accompany the stone tablets. One, entitled "Statement on the Hall of Pictures of the Sage" (Shengtudian shuo), is by Shao Yiren (inshi 158o), and the other, entitled "Record of the Hall of Pictures of the Sage" (Shengtudian ji), is by Zhang Yingdeng (jinshi 1583). One or both may appear in woodblock editions based on the tablets (discussed below; also Appendix items under C). Shao Yiren's text is also reproduced in the Qing commercial reprint of Shengji quantu (Appendix B-2, B-3); and it is transcribed with a few minor abridgements in Queli wenxian/kao (as in note 5; juan 34, 31a-32a [modern 889-91]) and in Qufu xianzhi (as in note 121; juan 30, 7a-b). Both inscriptions are reprinted by Baba Harukichi, who also lists the four-character titles of each picture; see Baba (as in note 5), 169-74. The information contained in both inscriptions is summarized in Kong Xianglin's preface to Kongzi Shengji tu (Jinan, Shandong 1988). The date "last month of autumn, 1592" is carved in the lower left corner of the last pictorial tablet. 119 He Chuguang (zi, Zhaowen; jinshi 1583) has biographical entries in Zhu Yizun, Ming shi zong (juan 54, 2oa) and Cao Rong, Mingren xiaozhuan (juan 3, ii8b). He's own compilation of biographies of men who served in the censorial system, Lantai fajian lu (preface dated 1597), includes entries not only for himself (uan 2o, 17b) but also Shao Yiren (juan 2o, 26b); and Zhang Kai (juan 7, 3b). Regional Inspectors were expected to visit every locality within their region during a one-year tour of duty and report extensively on all sorts of conditions there; see Hucker (as in note 26), 86-94; also Hucker, A Dictionary of Official Titles in Imperial China (Stanford, 1985), 2705. In 1588, shortly before his visit to Qufu, He had engineered the downfall of the eunuch Zhang Jing (d. 1608); see Dictionary of Ming Biography, 5o. 120 The sum He Chuguang raised from the prefecture and county (jun yi) is given as "4,ooo strings" (siqian min) in Zhang Yingdeng's record of the project (see note 118). Ixx Kong Hongfu has a biographical entry in Qufu xianzhi, Pan Chengzhi and Pan Xiang, comps. (1774),juan 91, 3a-b (Yenching Library, Rare Book T 3140/5624.83). Curiously enough, the rubbing of Zhang's inscription seems to say sixty-fourth rather than sixty-first generation, and characters for I and 4 seem to be superimposed. The district magistrate of Qufu was appointed by the Yanshenggong and usually was member of a collateral line of the Kong family. III</page><page sequence="40">1592, however, Zhang Yingdeng (finshi 1583), the Surveillance Vice-Commissioner for Shandong (Shandong ancha fushi),I arrived on the scene and told Kong Hongfu to expand the pictorial biography with eight episodes that had not been illustrated previously. In all, one hundred twelve illustrations were cut into separate rectangular tablets, and another eight slabs were incised with ancillary inscriptions, including a title frontispiece, a transcription of Zhu Xi's revised and annotated biography of Confucius, and two contemporary colophons, one by Zhang Yingdeng (dated the tenth lunar month of 159z), and the other (dated the first of the twelfth month of 1592) by Shao Yiren (jinshi1580)."I The first ten illustrations in the 1592 stone tablets cover the events related to Confucius's birth and early life, the same as in the second and third recensions but for an additional scene from Confucius's childhood.IZ4 A comparison of corresponding scenes reveals only minor changes in compositional arrangement, mostly involving details of the background setting. One change is more significant: In the fifth picture, the earlier recensions show Confucius's mother sitting with her newborn baby and heavenly musicians playing above the house (fig. IZ); the 1592 depiction omits the intimate maternal scene and shows only a roof in clouds and much larger musicians (fig. 22).Iz Nor do mother and child appear in the ninth scene, in which Confucius receives a fish after the birth of his son. The illustrations of major events near the end of Confucius's life and after his death also correspond to some degree among the three recensions; however, several of the post- humous incidents that had been added in the third recension are now dropped.Iz The stone tablets diverge more from the other recensions in the long middle section, where there are many new scenes. Zhang Yingdeng's colophon, entitled "Record of the Hall of Pictures of the Sage" (Shengtudian ji), explains why he had insisted on adding eight scenes, even though the project was far advanced when he became involved. Two were meant to affirm the true lineage of Confucian principles (daotong zhengmai);"I two others exemplified the cardinal principles of filial piety and parental IZZ Zi Yuzhang; jinshi 1583 (same year as He Chuguang); a native of Neijiang, Sichuan. I have not been able to find much biographical information on Zhang Yingdeng. The office he held was charged with "supervisory administration of judicial inquiry and penal matters and censorial surveillance over sub-provincial officialdom"; see Hucker, A Dictionary (as in note ii9), 495. Some insight into Zhang's personal character and interests may be gleaned from the prefaces to Tangyinjingzhongmiao zhi (1585), his book about the temple to Yue Fei in Tangyin xian, Henan. (A Qing reprint of 1735 is in the Yenching Library Rare Book collection, T 1796/I3oI.) The preface by Guo Pu (1511-93, jinshi 1565) says that ever since Zhang was a child, he had felt passionate indignation about the injustice suffered by the martyred Southern Song general. In the late Ming period, Yue Fei was regarded a model of selfless courage and patriotism who had been betrayed by the evil prime minister of a corrupt emperor. 123 According to the biographical information supplied by He Chuguang (see note II9), as well as comments in Shao Yiren's own record (see note II8), Shao (zi, Ziren) came from Puan, Guizhou and was a censorial official. In the winter of 1591, he was posted to Qufu as a military circuit intendant. 124 Scene 7, "Entering Pingzhong's school" (Ru Pingzhong xue). My numbering of scenes follows the numbers carved on the tablets themselves (see note II4), which is also the order of accession numbers written on the back of the rubbings in the Field Museum. 125 Perhaps the omission reflects a puritanical view that a Sage transcended flesh and blood. Liu Zongzhou (1578-1645) offered an argument along these lines in his memorial advocating that shrines to the father of Confucius be removed from temples of the official cult; see Liuzi quanshu (1822), juan 14, 22-23, quoted in Thomas Wilson, "The Ritual Formation of Confucian Ortho- doxy," The journal of Asian Studies 55 no. 3 (August 1996), 570. 12,6 See earlier discussion; also notes 89 and 93. 12" The two scenes are no. 92, "Transmitting (the doctrines of) subduing (self) and returning (to propriety) to Yan (Hui)" (Kefu chuan Yan), and no. 93, "Transmitting the Classic of Filial Piety to Zeng (-zi)" (Xiaojing chuan Zeng). II2</page><page sequence="41">benevolence (xiao ci dajie);128 another commemorated a historic site within the temple;I9 and so forth. Zhang's comments indicate a strong concern for promoting fundamental values of Cheng- Zhu Confucianism and commemorating its numinous sites. His Record also provides insight into the significance of the new monument in the eyes of the officials who created it. Not only were they establishing an enduring archive of pictures to record the life of Confucius, but even more importantly, they were ensuring that present and future generations of officials would be able to experience the inspiration of viewing the Sage in action. Zhang writes: (One) can respectfully regard [the pictures] and have an audience with them, or take rubbings of them and transmit them. Whether you ascend the hall and enter the chamber, or open a roll (of rubbings), you come face to face with virtue, almost like an admonition. If the Sage is not present in pictures nor in the hall, then by what means would he be seen? Zhang's confident assertion that viewing the pictures would put one directly in touch with Confucius represents one pole in an ongoing debate about the efficacy and proper function of representational images. At least one other supporter of the Shengjidian project disagreed with the implications of Zhang's position and articulated his doubts in the second text composed for the building, the "Statement on the Hall of Pictures of the Sage" (Shengtudian shuo) by Shao Yiren. Invited to contribute a few words, Shao took the opportunity to express some apprehensions about the glorification of the pictorial biography. He feared that some people would mistake the pictures for the essence of Confucius: "I am concerned that someone looking at these pictures might grasp only the traces and not think about what they are traces of." To Shao, Confucius's heart-mind (xin) was far more important: "Confucius used his heart-mind and obtained the transmission of Yao and Shun... This is how he made himself the model both for his own age and for transmission to later generations." Shao believed that it was better to study the thoughts and words of Confucius as revealed in the Six Classics, which were more reliable traces of his heart-mind than were "his bodily experiences and things he did not talk about." Moreover, Shao noted with disapproval that some of the episodes could seem to be merely sensational tales of the supernatural (shen) or strange (guai), if taken at face value. On the other hand, Shao recognized that the pictorial biography could make a positive contribution if approached in the proper spirit. "Thus, what is good about looking at the master is that you can recognize what he called benevolence (ren) and what he called singleness (yi). And Confucius's sageliness lies in these... The traces 'house' them." This comment suggests that Shao had no quarrel with the idea that Confucius himself was embodied in the pictures; rather, he worried that a viewer would respond only to superficial aspects of that Confucius. Finally, Shao speculates that the pictures could provide an expedient means of inspiring people to study Confucius's teachings. He admits that his own desire to study had been greatly stimulated by coming to Qufu and seeing the places associated with Confucius's life. Perhaps anticipating that the stone tablets would become better known through rubbings than from visits in person, he concludes by expressing the hope that the pictures would enable others to experience the same kind of inspiration, even if they did not have an opportunity to visit Qufu. 128 The two scenes are no. II, "Burying parents in the same mound" (Hesang yu fang), and no. 40, "Crossing the courtyard [and inquiring about the Books of] Odes and Rites" (Guoting Shi Li). 1 Scene III, "Planting a juniper at the Apricot Altar" (Xingtan zhi gui). There is no number visible on the Field's rubbing of this scene. The characters yibai ("one hundred") and an unusually large space appear on the tablet, which looks recarved. 113</page><page sequence="42">Despite their different points of view, both Zhang Yingdeng and Shao Yiren evince a common desire to revitalize the commitment to Confucian values among their contemporaries. This con- cern was shared by some twenty-five other officials who contributed financial and moral support to the project and are named at the end of Zhang's Record. Zhang refers to himself and his colleagues as the "sixtieth generation of Confucius's disciples" (shengmen liushi zhuan), a designation that suggests their sympathy with fundamentalist reform. In the bitter factionalism of the Wanli period, extreme reformers viewed contemporary politics as hopelessly corrupt and conceived a re- turn to the ideals embodied in the life of Confucius as both a literal possibility and moral ne- cessity. By sponsoring the creation of a comprehensive pictorial biography in a durable medium, for display in a place where many officials would see it and be inspired by it, the patrons of the Shengjidian publicly endorsed this uncompromisingly idealistic goal. Neither Zhang Yingdeng's Record of the Hall of Pictures of the Sage nor Shao Yiren's Statement mentions the names of the people who applied the technical skills required to carry out the pious project. These men did not enjoy the same degree of social prestige as the scholar-officials who financed the project. However, they were allowed to record their names on one of the tablets. Unobtrusive signatures carved at lower left on scene 112 reveal that Mao Fengyue, a student at the Qufu county school (Qufu xianxue shengyuan), collected and collated the texts for all episodes; Yang Zhi of Weiyang (Yangzhou) created illustrations; and Zhang Cao of Wujun (Suchou) carved the tablets. It is worth noting that the editorial talent was available locally, while the skilled artisans came from far away. This circumstance probably reflects the abundant supply of underemployed scholars and the scarcity of good craftsmen relative to demand in the late Ming period, and it suggests the increased independence and status of skilled artisans in an era of fundamental socio- economic change.130 Furthermore, the employment of a professional painter to draw the designs emphasizes the fact that narrative illustration was considered a job for an artisan-painter, rather than for someone who aspired to recognition as a literatus-amateur.I31 The stone tablets served in effect to canonize this set of biographical scenes, just as He Chu- guang had anticipated in proposing the project. Not only were the pictures executed in a durable material, they also were on perpetual view in a separate building in the first temple of the official cult of Confucius. Rubbings could be made from the slabs in order to spread the images more widely. Indeed, so many rubbings were taken that the stones were nearly illegible within a cen- tury. 32 However, as a means of dissemination, making rubbings of one hundred twenty stone slabs was not very efficient. Some time after the stones were erected, a new woodblock edition was carved in order to facilitate the wider distribution of this pictorial biography (fig. 22).133 The 130 Further support for this supposition is given in Craig Clunas, Superfluous Things: Material Culture and Social Status in Early Modern China (Cambridge, England and Urbana, Illinois, 1991). I3I Although many self-styled "amateurs" made their living as painters in the late Ming period, those with advanced education or elite aspirations conducted their business very differently from professional artisans. For further discussion and references to recent studies of this issue, see James Cahill, The Painter's Practice (New York, 1994). 132 This observation is made in Yu Zhaohui's Shengmiao tongji of 1687, quoted in Queli wenxian kao (as in note 5), juan 34, 32a-b (modern 891-92). In Laufer's rubbings (see note 114), many areas are entirely effaced, particularly around the figures, but the general plan of most compositions and most of the texts can be deciphered without difficulty. A more recent set of rubbings in the British Museum shows far less. Very little can be seen on the stones today. 133 For examples of the woodblock edition based on the stone tablets, see Appendix C-2 - C-4. Blocks for printing this edition are preserved in the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu, where they are attributed to the Kangxi period (Appendix C-5). A set of pictures has recently been specially printed from them for display in the Kuiwenge of the Temple of Confucius. 114</page><page sequence="43">pictures and texts were faithfully reproduced from the stone slabs at full size, but seven scenes were deleted and a few others reordered.134 It is actually this slightly reduced set of one hundred five scenes that circulated most widely in the early seventeenth century'35 and served as the basis for major reprints in 1874 and 1934, which directed the biographical illustrations to new pur- poses.I36 More clearly than the stone tablets themselves, the woodblock reproductions reveal the artistic character of the pictures, because subtle intaglio lines (incised into dark stones or left in reserve on an ink rubbing) have been transformed into positive relief on the woodblock prints. The com- positions portray lively narratives enacted by large and rather crudely drawn figures, whose naive faces and gesticulations convey animated interactions. The minimalist settings are sparse and open, and ubiquitous swirls of cloud convey an aura of antiquity. There is much to engage a viewer's attention. 5. A return to the source: the recarving of Zhang Kai's stones in the seventeenth century As discussed in some detail above, the third and fourth recensions of Shengji tu were closely associated with Qufu, the principal site of the state and ancestral cults of Confucius. In contrast, the first and second recensions had originated in the South (Zhang Kai's in Ningbo and He Tingrui's in Hengyang) and did not intersect with the cult in their subsequent circulation. In the early years of the seventeenth century, however, Zhang Kai's recension was reincarnated in another set of stone tablets, in conjunction with an effort to promote cultic recognition of Qingpu, a southern site that claimed an ancient link with the direct line of Confucius.I37 In the twenty- second generation after Confucius, a member of the Kong family was believed to have settled in Qingpu, near Songjiang, Jiangsu, to escape the chaos of the late Han period. A thirty-fourth- generation descendant was alleged to have buried Confucius's clothing and jades there in 606, and 134 The seven omitted are scenes II, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, and III (using the numbering of the Field Museum's rubbings), of which nos. ii and III had been created at Zhang Yingdeng's insistence. Later reprints (e.g. Kong Xianlan's of 1874 [Appendix C-Io] and the unidentified edition republished in 1934 by the Beiping minshe (Appendix [C-6]); see note 136) made further changes in order and also reversed the composition of scene 4, which depicted the five sages and two dragons that appeared in the sky on the eve of Confucius's birth. 135 A copy even found its way to France, where it served as the basis for a Monsieur Ponce to make twenty-four copper-engravings, rendered in European neoclassical style, as illustrations for a book on Confucius published in Paris in 1788. Twelve of them are reproduced in the 1984 calendar of the Confucius Hall of Hong Kong, which Jonathan Chaves kindly showed me. 136 The publisher of the 1874 edition (Appendix C-Io) was Kong Xianlan, a seventy-second-generation descendant of Confucius, who was concerned that the declining dynasty might not maintain financial support for the cult of Confucius and the Kong family. His edition changed the proportions of the pictures to make them more elongated and modified a few details in some scenes; the four-character titles were also reworded here and there. The 1934 edition was issued by the Beiping minshe, a nationalistic group concerned about modernization's threat to traditional values. Li Bingwei, who organized the publication, writes in his colophon that he republished an "old edition" (Appendix [C-6]) because "nothing moves the emotions and inspires profound reflection as effectively as pictures." The 1934 publication has been much reproduced in the 197Os and I98Os, both in Taiwan and mainland China (an example of the latter being Kongzi Shengfi tu; see note 118). As in the late Ming period, a heterogeneous market may be posited from the variety in quality and expense exhibited by these reprints and other illustrated works concerning Confucius. The history of the Shengfi tu in the twentieth century is a fascinating subject to which I intend to devote attention in a future study. 137 Appendix [A-I2]. The following summary is based on Kongzhai zhi (as in note 47), which is a gazetteer of the residence, temple, and grave. Kongzhai zhi is mainly concerned with the status of the site in the early Qing period, after extensive renovations and changes. Qingpu's greatest prominence was achieved in the early eighteenth century, when its cult status had been legitimated by visits and gifts from two emperors as well as the sixty-seventh-generation Yanshenggong, Kong Yuqi (1656-1723). The issues raised by the site deserve far more consideration than I can give them here. 115</page><page sequence="44">a family shrine was erected in the Southern Song period (between 1176-89) after the jades were accidentally unearthed. In the late Ming period, local officials and gentry built upon these leg- ends, whose truth they genuinely believed, to establish Qingpu's prestige and charisma. Between 16o6 and 16o9, the so-called Grave of the Clothes and Cap (Yiguan mu) was refaced with stone, and a Confucius temple (Kongmiao or Fuzi miao) was constructed nearby, on the presumed ruins of the earlier shrine. A new round of renovation some twenty years later attracted the support of such luminaries as Dong Qichang (1555-1636), Chen Jiru (1558-1639), and Chen Zilong (16o8-47), who promoted the site as a "little Queli." One of the sponsors of the initial rebuilding, Ni Fuying, owned a set of biographical pictures of Confucius, which he had carved on stone tablets.I38 To validate his work, he solicited a colophon from the great-great grandson of Zhang Kai, Zhang Jiude,I39 who as prefect of Songjiang was another active supporter of the temple. Zhang Jiude affirmed that the pictures were the same as those he had seen at home as a boy and endorsed the illustration of Confucius's life as a means of helping people visualize and comprehend his Way. He commended Ni for spending his resources to reproduce pictures of Confucius's life, unlike so many contemporaries, who lavished patronage on Buddhism and Daoism in hopes of attaining good fortune. Ni Fuying, for his part, wrote a colophon responding to an unnamed "guest" who had criticized the display of pictorial repre- sentations of Confucius's life as "petty and insignificant." Likening the pictures to "feet on a snake," the critic claimed that the Way of Confucius was already fully manifested in the Four Books and Six Classics. Ni argued that the pictures offered morally instructive role models that would help to awaken people's minds. In any event, through Ni Fuying's reproductions, Zhang Kai's ShengJi tu became embedded in the complex of cult sites at Qingpu (i.e., the Temple of Confucius, Tomb of the Clothes and Cap, and Kong residence), in the same way that the expanded biography had been implanted at Qufu in 1592. PAINTINGS In contrast to the plethora of woodblock-printed and incised-stone versions of the Shengfi tu, painted illustrations of Confucius's biography are surprisingly few in number. Moreover, paintings did not guide the evolution of the theme, contrary to standard expectations concerning relationships between painted and printed pictures of the same subject. Had the significance of the Shengfi tu resided chiefly in the artistry of its conception and execution, perhaps it would have been created in the more prestigious medium of painting, instead of in media traditionally associated with replication. 138 I have not found Ni in biographical references. His inscriptions note his hometown as Yunjian (i.e., Songjiang) and alternate name as Yian. He acquired the Shengfi tu pictures while serving as prefect of Xiangshan (Zhejiang). They may have been rubbings from Zhang Kai's stones (Appendix [A-i]), but the identification is complicated by the fact that the recut stones based on them were scattered during the Qing conquest. When the site was restored in the 1670s, a local gentleman named Fang Zhengfan (zi Gongxing) had the painter Chen Yin (zi Xinyan) copy twenty-one surviving tablets and supplement them with pictures from an unknown source, to create yet another set of stone tablets for the temple (Appendix [A-13]; fig. 26). This early Qing set contained thirty-six pictures (reproduced in Baba Harukichi, Kj Mj Seiseki zukan [Toky6, 1940], 2-37), whereas Zhang Kai's original set had included only about thirty. Fang's inscription suggests that he wanted to reinstall the tablets because Zhang Kai's descendant, Zhang Jiude (who had written an inscription for Ni Fuying's tablets), had helped the Fang family regain their name after one hundred fifty years of using a different one, because of the Yongle emperor's ferocious punishment of their ancestor, Fang Xiaoru (1357-14o2). The relevant texts are recorded in juan 5 of Kongzhai zhi (as in note 47). It is unclear whether any part of either of the seventeenth-century sets of stone tablets is extant today. 139 Alternate names Shuhai and Xianzhong. 116</page><page sequence="45">However, what held foremost importance was not the style, but rather the subject matter of the pictorial biographies. The Shengfi tu was intended to improve the character of those who saw it and to bring utopian social ideals closer to realization. Thus, it was fitting for illustrations of Confucius's life to be depicted in media that lent themselves to convenient reproduction, because a wider distribu- tion of the pictures would enable more people to experience his transformative influence. To treat the pictorial biography as an object for purely aesthetic contemplation was to misunderstand its purpose, and to hoard it as a precious treasure was to diminish its efficacy. Nonetheless, it is likely that many people actually regarded the biographical pictures more as emblems of Confucian piety than as calls to action.I40 In this circumstance, a painted version might have seemed more impressive than a printed one. The painting medium had acquired prestige by its long association with great artists, recorded by name, whose brushes were thought to wield the creative forces of nature itself. In addition, paintings were usually made one at a time and cost consid- erably more than prints. Even if paintings of the Shengji tu were actually done by an unnamed artisan, they enjoyed some of the mystique inherent in the medium. A patron who wanted the venerable subject rendered in a mode associated with high art probably hoped to enhance his reputation as a person of taste as well as lofty character, and may have been attentive to aesthetic pleasure as well as moral uplift. Some of the colophons on painted versions of the Shengfi tu signal a shift of focus in this direction by saying relatively little about Confucius's life or the need to reform political life. Instead, they devote attention to the life and achievements of the presumed artist. From the examples I have found so far, it appears that painted versions invariably reproduce a concise set of biographical pictures, rather than an expanded version. As discussed below, there are at least one handscroll and two albums of paintings in ink and color on silk, and reflections of a third album survive in a sketch-copy done in ink on paper by a Japanese artist in the Edo or early Meiji period. The sketch-copy's master and one of the painted albums are attributed to Wang Zhenpeng, and the handscroll bears the signature of Kong Zhenyun. In addition, single episodes are depicted in a few stand-alone paintings, among which are attributions to the Ming masters Wu Wei (1459-1508) and Qiu Ying (ca. I5oi--ca. 1552).141 140 Jonathan Chaves has suggested to me that there may be similarities between the Shengji tu and the baojuan of popular Buddhism, which also had a picture-and-text format. In the realm of popular Confucianism, however, stories of filial sons were far more important than the biography of Confucius himself. 141 It is not impossible that some of these single-scene Ming paintings originally belonged to sets of hanging scrolls, but the question awaits further investigation. The examples I have found so far are the following: Wu Wei, Zilu Asks the Way to the Ford(Palace Museum, Beijing), a large handscroll in ink on pink paper printed with a landscape design and decorated with sprinkled gold flakes; reproduced in Mingdai gongting yu Zhepai huihua xuanji (Beijing, 1983), no. 67. The picture is 46.3 cm. x 181.1 cm. An appended colophon by Xu Lin (1462-1528) is dated 151o.

II7</page><page sequence="46">The painted album attributed to Wang Zhenpeng came to light briefly at the turn of the twentieth century, when it was purchased by an unidentified Englishman and reproduced in full by a Shanghai publisher.I4' The last leaf bears the purported signatures of Wang Zhenpeng and the calli- grapher Yu He (fl. ca. 133o-6o), and Yuan and Ming colophons and seals accompany the work. How- ever, the texts for the biographical episodes are the prose explanations and zan composed by Zhang Kai in 1444, making a Yuan attribution impossible. The colophons and seals appear to have been fabricated at a single time. There are only ten paintings in the album, and the first colophon makes it clear that there never were more than ten. Nine correspond exactly to compositions that would have been in the 1444 first recension. The remaining leaf shows, as a single illustration, two related scenes that previously were in separate pictures. At one side, the duke of Lu receives the female entertainers and horses sent by Qi to distract him from sober statecraft; at the other, Confucius heads toward his oxcart to leave the state, after resigning from his advisory position in disgust.I43 Conflated depictions of these two re- lated events are otherwise known to have appeared in the 1590s.I44 The ten pictures are accompanied by Zhang Kai's prose explanations and zan, in which a few characters have been altered. The texts are placed directly on the paintings, rather than outside the borders, but there are no four-character titles. Although published photographs of the album are too small and murky to permit close analysis of the style of painting, a late sixteenth-century date seems appropriate. A second painted album is an anonymous work in ink and colors on silk, now in the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu.145 It contains thirty-six scenes whose compositions are close to the corresponding ones in faithful reprints of the 1497 second recension, but the introductory iconic portrait and three 142 Appendix [A-I8]. Shenzhou guoguang ji, zengkan, no. 2 (Shanghai, 1908); a copy of this extremely rare publication is in the Beijing Library, Beihai branch (zhuan 5o/I6.I4). Laufer reproduced the Shenzhou photographs in reduced size and accepted the paintings as Wang Zhenpeng's; see Laufer (as in note 3), 208-17. The album was also seen by Sun Yuxiu (see note 24). The paintings are accompanied by four colophons, whose comments fit together so neatly as to suggest a later forgery. The authors are supposedly Yuan Jue (1266-1327), Zhan Xiyuan (fl. mid-late 14th c.), Shao Bao (1460-1527), and Wen Peng (1498- 1573). There are numerous seals purporting to belong to the eminent collector/pawnshop owner Xiang Yuanbian (1525-90). If the seals are genuine, Xiang probably was the patron and original owner of the album. 143 Much confusion has been generated by the version published by Zheng Zhenduo as the original 1444 edition (see note 84; Appendix A-7), which has no illustration of the women and horses, only a scene of Confucius departing. As previously discussed, Zheng's edition actually is a late Ming commercial reprint. It seems likely that Zhang Kai's 1444 set (Appendix [A- i]) included both pictures but only one text for the related events, and the text probably accompanied the scene of Confucius's departure. Both the Jifu edition of circa 15o6 (Appendix A-8) and the 1548 edition of Zhu Yinyi (Appendix A-4, A-5) contain two separate scenes and a single text that pertains to both. Interestingly enough, the Japanese screens (see note 77; Appendix [A-22], A-23), which are based on the Jifu edition, also combine the scene of women and horses with that of Confucius's departure. Here, however, the arrival of women and horses is placed above the departure, resulting in an illustration double the normal height. 144 The conflated illustrations appear in the 1592 stone tablets (see Appendix C-I) and in the 1598 Xiansheng xiaoxiang (see Appendix A-Io, A-Ii). 145 Appendix A-17. The leaves are fully reproduced in Kaji (see note 24), as well as in Shengji zhi tu (Jinan, Shandong, 1989). Most leaves also appear in Da zai Kongzi (see note I), and some have been exhibited abroad as part of the promotion of Qufu as the home of Confucius (see the exhibition catalogue, Kishi no genkyj yonsennen ten, T6ky6, 1993). The present order of scenes is a modern reconstruction because the illustrations are not numbered, in contrast to printed examples. The album seems to be a fairly recent addition to the collection of the Kong Family Mansion (Kongfu). It has two Qing colophons, by Cheng Man (1729) and Wei Zhizhang (1730), both unidentified. At that time, the album was in Yangzhou and belonged to a Wang Ziqin, in all likelihood a wealthy merchant. The inscriptions exhort Wang not to treat his purchase simply as an elegant trophy of ancient culture, but to learn from the pictures. They provide no information about original numbers of leaves or authorship. II8</page><page sequence="47">other illustrations are missing.146 Conversely, the album gives two scenes to an incident that else- where is depicted as a single composition, Confucius's resignation from the service of Duke Ling of Wei, after the duke offended him by sharing his carriage with his wife rather than with Confucius. There is only one text for the two compositions, and it is written on the carriage scene. Although unsigned and undated, the Qufu album probably also belongs to the later sixteenth century.147 Like the painted album attributed to Wang Zhenpeng, its texts are incorporated into the pictorial space, as in the 1592 recension, although without the four-character titles of the latter. Moreover, the album is painted in a style reminiscent of late Zhe School, particularly in the treat- ment of landscape and figures. In several of the paintings, there are large standing screens decorated with full landscape (fig. 23), a motif consistently inflated from corresponding examples in reprints of the 1497 recension. For example, the screens portrayed in the Jifu edition (ca. 15o6) are mostly undecorated (figs. 6, 7, 13), while those in Zhu Yinyi's edition (1548) variously depict the sun or moon, waves and clouds, and trees or branches with or without birds (fig. 15).148 This shift to greater ornamentation may reflect changes in taste over time or among different types of collectors. The album cannot have been the prototype for any of the woodblock editions because one composition is missing a crucial motif found in them: the illustration of Confucius's encounter with the Daoist who heard him playing the stone chimes omits the chime on the table (figs. 23-24). This omission suggests the simple carelessness of a painter who was copying from a model without knowing the story. The Japanese sketches, which probably were made in the nineteenth century, reproduce what purports to have been another set of pictures attributed to Wang Zhenpeng, according to three Ming colophons that also were copied by the Japanese artist.149 All three colophons were by high officials in the Ministry of Rites in Beijing, and one owner of the paintings was an official named Zhao. The earliest colophon (1510) is by the eminent statesman and calligrapher Li Dongyang (I447-1516, jinshi 1463), whose involvement with the cult of Confucius was unusually full. As chief Grand Secretary, he had represented the emperor at the ceremony to dedicate the newly reconstructed (after a fire in 1499) Temple of Confucius in Qufu in 15o4, and in 1505 he had participated in publishing the first edition of Queli zhi.I5? Also around this time, Li's daughter married Kong Wenshao, who held the title of Yanshenggong in the sixty-second generation after Confucius. Some years after Li's colophon on the album, another note was inscribed by Yang Xunji (1458-1546, jinshi I484), who discussed the dual 146 The other three that are omitted are scenes that show a man of Zheng telling the disciple Zigong that Confucius looked like either a sage of antiquity or a dog guarding a house in mourning; Confucius serving as zhongduzai to Duke Ding of Lu; and Confucius advising Duke Ding to order his vassals to take down fortifications that exceeded the regulations. These scenes do appear in later recensions. The Qufu Administrative Commission of Cultural Relics believes that the paintings are now simply incomplete; see Shengji zhi tu (as in note 145), introduction. 147 I would date the album slightly later than Kaji Nobuyuki, who has proposed a date between 1497-155o; see Kaji (as in note 24), 5. 148 The screens in the "Wang Zhenpeng" album (Appendix [A-I8]) are also undecorated, while those in the Japanese sketches (Appendix A-2o; discussed below) depict full landscapes. 149 Appendix A-2o. The album is now in the T6ky6 National Museum (acc. no. 5612). A Japanese colophon, dated 1879, states that the sketches reproduced a painting that was said to belong to a Nagasaki temple. I am indebted to James Cahill for giving me xeroxes of the images, to Kohara Hironobu for helping me to locate the album, and to Kunigo Hideaki for showing it to me. 150 See Li's biography in the Dictionary of Ming Biography, 877-81. For Queli zhi, see note 5. In the summer ofI51o, when Li admired and colophoned the Shengji tu, Beijing officialdom was in the grip of the eunuch Liu Jin (ca. 1452-1510), who effectively controlled the court and governmental affairs. A few months later, Li helped to engineer Liu's precipitous arrest and execution. For further details, see the Dictionary of Ming Biography, 941-45; and James Geiss, "The Cheng-te Reign, 15o6-1521" in The Cambridge History (as in note 69), 403-39. 119</page><page sequence="48">model that Confucius's life presented for officials: He was a "sage for one hundred ages" (bai shi zhi sheng), yet he had failed to persuade the regimes of his day to put his ideals of political administration into practice.ISI Although the original paintings from which the Japanese sketch copies were made are now lost, the attribution to the Yuan painter Wang Zhenpeng was undoubtedly spurious.I5 Of the eighteen compositions preserved in the sketches, only sixteen depict episodes that were included in the first and second recensions ofSheng/i tu. One episode, Confucius's encounter with Jieyu, the "crazy man of Chu" (fig. 25), makes its appearance in printed Shengji tu starting with the third recension.I53 The remaining one, Confucius answering Duke Ai of Lu's question about how to select men for govern- ment, is otherwise found only in the set of thirty-six stone tablets carved in about 168o to replace Ni Fuying's 16o9 set at the Qingpu temple.154 Conversely, all eighteen compositions are found within the Qing stone set (itself partially based on an unidentified model), and the corresponding scenes resemble each other very closely. By contrast, the illustrations of the same episodes in the Ming printed editions are less closely related to the Japanese sketches, particularly in the incidental details of settings and furnishings. Several compositions in the Japanese copy are mirror-reversed, as are the same scenes in the Qing stones (figs. 26, 7). Therefore, it seems likely that the painted handscroll or album copied by the Japanese artist was a work of the seventeenth century and that the three Ming colophons were either forgeries or were originally written for another painting. The texts accom- panying the pictures omit Zhang Kai's zan, and the prose explanations seem closest to those of Wu Jiamo's Kongsheng jiayu tu.I55 Finally, another set of paintings whose features suggest a seventeenth-century prototype is a handscroll that went to Japan in the Edo period and is now in the Idemitsu Museum, T6ky6.I56 The handscroll presents a continuous series of thirty-six colorful paintings on silk, each with a large title (ending in tu, "picture") and a straightforward prose explanation of the event in smaller calligraphy below. The scenes are in exactly the same order and bear the same titles and texts as a Chongzhen-era (1627-44) woodblock edition largely based on the second recension.I57 The pictures themselves are also virtually identical, except for one important detail: the Idemitsu paintings include the mother and baby in the scenes illustrating the births of Confucius and his son (fig. 27), but the Chongzhen 151 The third colophon is a brief, undated note by Yuan Gun (jinshi 1538), which is inserted between Li's and Yang's but appears to be the latest of the three. There are also two Japanese colophons, which were written for the sketch-copy rather than for the original paintings. 152 Even Li Dongyang's colophon expresses polite doubt about the attribution. After a conventional recitation of Wang Zhenpeng's biography and accomplishments, Li disingenuously wonders how this set of paintings could have been previously unknown: had it been hidden away in the Yuan palace? 153 See Appendix items under B. Confucius heard Jieyu singing that the world was in chaos and one should withdraw, but Jieyu fled when Confucius tried to speak with him. The episode is based on Shiji, juan 47,1933. 154 The incident appears in Kongzi jiayu, juan I, 12; translated by Kramers (as in note 32), 226. For the early Qing set of thirty-six stone tablets, see note 138 and Appendix [A-131. 155 For Wu's book, see Appendix items under D. The texts often add dates in the reign of the Zhou emperor and/or the local feudal lord. 156 Acc. no. 129 (Suzuki index JMI8-O41), unpublished; Appendix A-I9. A later label on the outside of the scroll gives the title as Kongzi yidai tu zan, and it has a companion scroll containing eighteenth-century Japanese poems and colophons. I am most indebted to Professor Ogawa Hiromitsu of T6ky6 University and Mr. Yuba Tadanori, Chief Curator of the Idemitsu Museum, for enabling me to view the paintings. 157 I examined reprints of the Chongzhen edition at Princeton and in Beijing (see note 85; Appendix A-15). It includes a 1629-dated colophon written by Grand Secretary Han Kuang (ca. I558-ca. 1637) for a now-lost handscroll (Appendix [A-14]). Izo</page><page sequence="49">edition follows the 1592 stone tablets in omitting the maternal scenes (cf. fig. 22).158 At the end of the scroll is the signature of the calligrapher, Kong Zhenyun, who identifies himself as a sixty-eighth- generation descendant of Confucius, suggesting that he probably was active in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.I59 CONCLUSION It should now be obvious that none of the versions of the Sheng/i tu discussed above can be taken as the absolute standard by which to measure other versions. No one set subsumes all the others, al- though the 1592 stone tablets come closest to being comprehensive. The formation of the pictorial biography of Confucius was an ongoing, organic process, which continues even today.160 From Zhang Kai's initial group of between twenty-nine and thirty-four biographical pictures, created in 1444, the set expanded several times during the later Ming period. Scenes added in the 1497 second recension became part of the core set,161 but the numerous additions made in the later recensions were less secure. Even though the 1592 stone tablets in the Shengjidian constituted the largest expansion of the subject, with one hundred twelve scenes, they did not include fifteen that had been introduced in the third recension. And later versions omit several of the 1592 additions to the pictorial biography. The transience of certain illustrations suggests that they were deemed either inessential or inappropriate by later compilers. The repeated reshaping of the pictorial biography implies competing conceptions of Confucius and the significance of his life. In addition to modifications in content, the sequence of episodes also varied. Indeed, the order of illustrations is different in virtually every version. Changes in arrangement signify disagreement about the correct chronology of events in Confucius's life, in some cases reflecting conflicts among the ancient textual sources. Not surprisingly, the scenes most likely to vary in placement depict episodes that were not linked to a specific year or age in Confucius's life. For example, the emblematic tableau of Confucius seated with his books and surrounded by disciples (eventually entitled Tuixiu Shi Shu) moved from the middle in the first and second recensions, to near the end in the third recension, and finally to near the beginning in the fourth. Unreconcilable differences in the order of scenes even occur among editions belonging to the same recension, as demonstrated by the constant shuffling within the second recension of the episode in which Zilu asks the way to the ford (later entitled Zilu wen jin). Conversely, there were several stable clusters of scenes, within which the order did not change. This combination of stable core and flexible variations seems characteristic of Chinese 158 See note 125; Appendix C-I. 159 Zhenyun must be his zi, because the sixty-eighth generation's ming was Chuan and the character Zhen was used as the first part of their zi. The Yanshenggong of this generation, Kong Chuanduo, lived from 1674-1735. 16o A recent reformulation of the life of Confucius is embodied in a set of thirty-one tablets created in 1987 for display at the Temple of Confucius in Qufu, where it is seen by hundreds of tourists every day. A series of twenty tablets in a very similar style is reproduced in Shi Ke, Kongzi shiji tu, Lunyu zhenyan yin (Jinan, 1987). Each scene portrays several events and includes identifying labels. Carved in an archaic style inspired by the Wu Family shrine, these pictures portray Confucius as a model citizen, literally larger-than-life. The hagiography owes much to the conventions that were developed to present Communist heroes, such as Lei Feng. I6I All but one of the thirty-nine pictures were retained in the third and fourth recensions (Appendix items under B and C, respectively). The scene showing Confucius hearing Shao music in the state of Qi was dropped, perhaps because the Sage's sub- sequent avoidance of meat sounded too much like Buddhist vegetarianism (Benjamin Elman, private communication). It had been part of Zhang Kai's original set (Appendix [A-I]). izi</page><page sequence="50">narrative genres in general, and analogous situations can be found with multiple versions of short stories, novels, plays, and operas. Because the Shengji tu explicated the lofty morality of Confucius himself within the inherently engaging genre of figural narrative, the pictures offered both edification and diversion, whose relative proportions reflected the interests of different patrons or audiences. From the origins and initial cir- culation of the pictorial biography among the official elite, to whom it symbolized the highest ideals of the profession, the Shengji tu moved out into more diverse realms of society. The theme was taken up in succession by Ming princes (Zhu Jianjun and Zhu Yinyi) to enhance their cultural prestige, by a non-officeholding educated man (Wu Jiamo) who sought recognition for his scholarly industry, and by commercial publishers who recognized potential market appeal. Different ratios of morality to entertainment in various renditions of the pictorial biography created a spectrum that extends from Zhang Kai's decorously uplifting compilation, at one extreme, to the diverting chuanqi play at the other. Sober renditions conveyed the ideological values of censors and other officials concerned about moral caliber, while the more attractive or engaging versions invoked the aesthetic pleasures and diversions of late Ming culture in greater measure. Commercial editions not only made the pictorial biography available to a much broader public, including many who could never set foot in a Confucian temple, but also adapted the theme to serve in other conceptual frameworks. In addition to straightforward reprints of the Shengji tu as a self- contained work, pictures of Confucius's life came to embellish other texts, which varied considerably in their moral or scholarly respectability. These other works ranged from a classical text representing the high end of orthodox scholarship (Kongsheng jiayu tu), to compendia of Confucian learning that were probably intended for non-elite men aspiring to higher status (Kongsheng quanshu), to popular history (Xinqie Kongsheng zongshi chushen quanzhuan),I6' and entertaining drama only minimally intended to edify the reader (Xinbian Kongfuzi zhouyou lieguo dacheng qilin ji). Furthermore, the pictures themselves were reformulated to fit these new contexts, both to improve their market appeal and to economize on expenses. Panoramic scenes with many small figures typically were transformed into closeup views with fewer but larger and more expressive figures. In addition, buildings and furnishings were updated to reflect contemporary styles and tastes. To some extent, such formal and stylistic adaptations may also reflect the involvement of the same designers and blockcarvers who produced attractive illustrations for fiction and drama, as Katherine Carlitz has observed in analyzing late Ming illustrated biographies of exemplary women.163 At the same time that the biographical pictures were circulating within and being reshaped by late Ming unofficial culture, they retained their original symbolism and ideological thrust even more intensely among the official elite in the increasingly factionalized milieu of late Ming politics. The alliance of officials and local gentlemen who installed the Shengffi tu inside the Qufu temple put the pictures forward as the visible embodiments of Confucian moral principles in action, promoting them as complements to the texts that preserved Confucius's teachings in verbal form. Convinced that representational images might have an impact that written words alone did not, the sponsors of the stone tablets invoked the immediacy of pictures to stimulate viewers to a higher level of moral consciousness. Because of the danger that the sensual appeal of pictures might deflect a viewer's attention from moral reflection, however, Shao Yiren emphasized their status as surrogates for the life I62 See note II5. 163 See note 72. Izz</page><page sequence="51">of Confucius, which offered vicarious contact with the Sage to inspire the viewer to further his own moral cultivation. Acceptance of the view that the biographical pictures in some way embodied the presence of Confucius made it possible to use them to associate the Sage with places he had never visited. The creation of a set for display in the temple at Qingpu substantiated Confucius's connection to a site that claimed a tie through a much later descendant. Because no one named Kong was involved, it was not a clan-based effort to gain genealogical status in the official Kong lineage, but rather a bid by local gentry and officials to acquire special recognition for a site within their locality. And in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, new sets ofShengfi tu were sponsored in order to bolster the posi- tion of Qufu itself by confirming its importance as the home of Confucius.64 In the post-Mao era, new sets have been installed there to enhance its appeal to the modern tourist.I65 Ultimately, the Shengji tu symbolizes the attempt to reassert the traditional social hierarchy and its values in periods of change and instability. The late Ming was such a time, for its emperors did not provide leadership and its officials were paralyzed by inter- and intramural conflicts, even as increased urbanization and economic development threatened the hierarchical order by opening new ways to wealth, status, and pleasure. The late nineteenth and twentieth centuries have also provided the conditions that favor the production of pictorial biographies of Confucius, as Chinese civilization has faced challenges from outside. The Shengfi tu has become part of an ongoing struggle to define and defend Chinese civilization against the encroachment of Western values, whether represented by Christianity, capitalism, Communism, or hedonistic individualism. In response to apparent break- downs of traditional society, the Shengji tu affirms the value of self-cultivation and ceremonial propriety. Confucius's life has come to embody the core values of the traditional Chinese heritage, and its depiction has become a medium for persuading others, including foreigners, that traditional Chinese culture is both admirable in itself and a strong foundation for future development.
