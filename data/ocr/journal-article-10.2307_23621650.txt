Many tributes have been paid to Dr Catling's distinguished career of academic and personal service. Archaeology in Greece, however, owes a particular debt to him as one of its outstanding editors. Not only did Hector Catling compile the supplement almost single-handedly throughout his directorship of the School, but his research also contributed richly to it, notably via his major excavations at Knossos (for example in the North Cemetery) and in Lakonia at the Menelaion and the Sanctuary of Zeus Messapeus at Tsakona. Archaeology in Greece remains one of his lasting contributions to the scholarly community. In June 2013 we also mourned the passing of two close colleagues, Spyridon Iakovides, Academician and distin guished excavator of Mycenae (where he remained active to the very end of his life), and Elisavet Stasinopoulou, formerly Keeper of Vases and Minor Arts at the National Museum in Athens. In July 2013 we were saddened by the untimely death of Polyxeni Bouyia, expert on central Greece and, as Keeper of the Bronze Collection at the National Museum, a key collaborator in the outstandingly successful Antikythera exhibition. And as we went to press, we received news of the death of George Hourmouziadis, Professor Emeritus of prehistoric archae ology in the Aristotle University, Thessaloniki. As Zosia Archibald emphasizes in her overview, this year we continue to see the fruits of a remarkable decade of fteldwork. The publication of seven fascicules of ADelt 56-59 (2001-2004), complemented by major regional conferences on Crete, Macedonia and Thrace, and central Greece, provides a huge wealth of information, with more yet to come. The first international conference on Archaeological Work in the Peloponnese (AEPEL) in November 2012 saw a full five days of papers, with the 168 communications programmed covering everything from early hominids to museology. The aim is to create a regional forum analogous to that provided by the AEThSE meetings, the most recent of which is fully reported in this year's AG by Maria Stamatopoulou. Undoubtedly it will take us several years yet to assimilate these data, under stand trends and assess new research directions. However, presentations at these conferences were not confined to analyses of data from the 'remarkable decade'. While the current crisis has had a huge impact on the careers and working conditions of colleagues in the Archaeological Service, research and rescue excavation continues to produce results of major importance. Consider, for example, the discovery of a Geometric temple under the Archaic structure on the Trapeza hill (ID3564: references to online data are signalled by the prefix ID and a number which can be used as a direct search criterion within AGOnline) - further evidence of the rich architectural development of Achaia during the eighth century - or the monumental funerary tumulus now revealed at Amphipolis (ID3073), the identity and even date of which await further research, and the excavation by the Universities of Ioannina and of Western Greece of the first Christian funerary monument (of the second half of the fourth century AD) at Paravela just outside Argos Orestikon (ancient Diocletianoupolis) (ID3080). The continuing stream of discoveries may seem surprising in the present climate, but major public works projects continue (in some cases being restarted after several years' hiatus). Discoveries made during rescue excavation prior to the creation of the Ilarion dam on the borders of Kozani and Grevena in Macedonia included the Neolithic to Hellenistic settlement at Longa Elatis (ID2577), now submerged as the dam is put into operation. Major transport projects such as the Corinth-Patras motorway have led to important discov eries which now require hard decisions about preservation and access: the painted Roman tomb found in the Corinthia (ID2910) is a case in point, and major finds in the Keryneia area, on which we will report in future years, have led to reconsideration of the course of the motorway. The fate of an exceptionally well-preserved street inter section and surrounding quarter of Byzantine Thessaloniki unearthed during the construction of the Venizelou Street metro station (ID3065) has become a cause célèbre (Fig. 1). With antiquities to be found on all sides, there is no possibility of a minor adjustment, and the current alterna tives of major rerouting of the metro to keep the remains in situ in the cityscape or their removal to an archaeo 1.

Following the success of the conference Interpreting the Seventh Century BC, in December 2011,a further workshop in December 2012 on Thessalian sanctu aries and cults, organized in collaboration with the University of Oxford, brought together 24 speakers, including many colleagues from Thessalian ephoreias and the University of Thessaly, to present new data and reflec tions. Maria Stamatopoulou comments further on material presented at this meeting in her contribution to this year's AG below. In London, collaboration with colleagues in the British Museum's Department of Greece and Rome resulted in a very popular study day on Knossos: from Labyrinth to Laboratory in November 2012 (now published online at www.bsa.ac.uk). This will soon be followed (on 2 November 2013) by a further collaboration in a British Museum Classical Colloquium on Archaeology Behind the Battle Lines: Macedonia 1915-1919, also in partnership with the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Among our ongoing field projects, I begin with discussion of the excavation at Koutroulou Magoula in Thessaly directed by Nina Kyparissi-Apostolika (Director Emérita, EPSNE) and Yannis Hamilakis (Southampton), which in 2012 sought to clarify activity in the area of two Neolithic buildings uncovered in 2011 (Fig. 2). One of these buildings had been mostly destroyed in later periods, although evidence of outdoor activity includes hearths and in situ deposits. The other had stone walls preserved to a height of 0.8m (with at least three building phases) and a mud-brick superstructure. One locus of open-air activity during this period produced evidence of hearths, feasting remains and depositional pits. Among the portable finds, 95 figurines take the site total to over 300 - one of the highest densities in any Neolithic site in Greece. A later, 1 The following account draws on reports of British School activ ities presented at the Archaeological Society of Athens (by courtesy of the General Secretary, Dr Vassileios Petrakos), the Aristotle University, Thessaloniki (by courtesy of the Department of History and Archaeology) and the British Academy. Further details of the School and its activities may be found in the Annual Report, published online at www.bsa.ac.uk. The School's programme is made possible by the close collaboration of many colleagues in the Ministry of Culture.

The structure is substantial: the chamber is up to 2.65m in diameter, with walls preserved to a height of 0.6m and retaining evidence of corbelling. Although finds from the wider area of the tomb have not yet been fully studied, preliminary indications suggest that it was probably built at the end of the Bronze or the beginning of the Iron Age. In addition, a new geophysical survey provides a near-complete picture of the wider tell area, revealing further indications of terrace walls and perimeter ditches previously suggested in topographical survey. Trial excavation on the eastern periphery of the tell exposed linear features (possibly a robbed wall); a series of parallel earth features at the foot of the tell on the east side appear to be ditches, which were sampled for soil micro morphology. On the island of Keros, the site of highly productive excavations in 2006-2008, Colin Renfrew (University of Cambridge), Mariza Marthari (Director Emérita, 21st EPCA) and Ekaterini Dellaporta (Director, 2nd EBA) directed a first season of intensive survey, geomorpho logical mapping and sampling (Fig. 4).

Near complete vases include an Attic Middle Geometric II triple skyphos, a rare form otherwise unknown in domestic contexts (Fig. 6). In the badly eroded South West Area, the presence of Iron Age structures was confirmed, with Early/Middle Protogeometric deposits associated with an apsidal wall and a pit (this period is otherwise poorly represented on the Xeropolis). Pottery studies focused on Iron Age utilitarian pottery, cooking ware and pithoi. Several groups were identified on the basis of fabric, surface finish and vessel form, noting in particular parallels from Zagora and sites in neighbouring regions (Fig. 7). Study of small finds focused on stone and metals. Apart from stone burnishers perhaps used in pottery manufacture, finds include fragments of an open mould for a dagger and a decorated item, and another perhaps for a spearhead. Metalworking is further indicated by terracotta crucible fragments, in some cases with small quantities of copper or bronze remaining, and slag/corroded metal and perhaps ores found in the settlement. A small piece of a copper (oxhide?) ingot was found in the megaron area. At Thisbe (Medieval Kastorion) six seasons of research in 2005-2008 and 2011-2012, led by Archibald Dunn (Birmingham), have seen the complete recording of the monumental topography of pre-Classical to Late Roman Thisbe/Byzantine-Frankish Kastorion including six phases of fortification, two rock-cut necropoleis, the remains of 13 Byzantine churches and chapels, and other post-Roman building foundations. Eleven monuments have been surveyed with a 3D laser scanner and geophysical surveys have been made in and around four. Post-Byzantine chapels and monumental post-Byzantine linoi for wine fermentation were also recorded, plus two Ottoman fiscal threshing-floor complexes. Discoveries arising from integration of survey and textual data on Thisbe's harbour in the Bay of Domvraina include a Classical to Hellenistic watchtower situated to overlook two loci of maritime traffic. 6. Lefkandi: Attic MGII triple skyphos. © BSA, Lejkandi Excavations. Geoarchaeological ñeldwork in 2011-2012 aimed to describe key elements of the sedimentary fill of the basin and to improve understanding of the central waterworks near Thisbe. The plain of Thisbe is shown to have been stable from at least 2,200 BP but, as a component of a poorly-drained enclosed basin (a polje), subject to major seasonal inflows of water which would challenge the sedentary farmer. A stone-lined earthwork running north-south in the centre of the Thisbe plain may have served as a dam-causeway, containing the temporary lake at the west side of the dam and helping to irrigate the lands to the east through controlled inundation; the visible part is probably Hellenistic. Sediments exposed in excavation by the Ministry of Culture and Sport may indicate that the east flank was set in an earlier (perhaps Mycenaean) earthwork. A ground-penetrating radar survey aimed to distinguish between basin matrix, this early earthwork and a colluvial fan that is submerging one of these earthworks and the floodplain. Linear features identified on the north side of the basin must be buried sections of the Classical to Hellenistic structure. Its façade, preserved in many places, contains sluice gates and adjoins the earthen embankment phase(s) visible at ground level. The north</page><page sequence="6">CATHERINE MORGAN 7. Lefkandi: Early Iron Age pithos. © BSA, Lefkandi Excavations. part of the structure was later used as the base of a major (Frankish/Ottoman) irrigation channel that supplied the lower lands on either side of the dam. The work of the Fitch Laboratory Senior Visiting Fellow, Sylvie Yona Waksman (CNRS/Lyon 2), also focused on Medieval Boeotia. In the 12th and 13th centuries, several types of Byzantine ceramics were widespread in the Aegean and the Mediterranean, their trade also attested by the large quantities present in shipwrecks. Despite the long time span indicated by their revised typo-chronology, chemical analysis implies their association with a single production location, and thus a major pottery production centre for this period. Several hypotheses have been proposed for this location, including Cyprus and Anaia in western Anatolia. But Thebes and its surrounds form a plausible candidate, noting the city's status as a major commercial centre and the high frequency of such pottery in the region, even on rural sites. Dr Waksman investigated this hypothesis using recently discovered pottery from rescue excavations in Thebes as reference material for local production (Fig. 8). Samples of reference material for Theban production and of typical Middle Byzantine wares are currently being subjected to analysis by WD-XRF. The Fitch Laboratory continues to focus on technique development and on ensuring the long-term integrity of its data. A workshop in April 2012 on aspects of inter laboratory comparability brought together researchers ΪΙΓίΤ^ΤΪΪΪΓίΤ» - ί-β . SSiíSV. mSS' ;.·: ¡¿¡¿¡¿¡Άy¿*&gt; &lt;^l VC&gt; " 8.

The Laboratory's WD-XRF unit is now fully operational and producing analytical data following the development of a calibration method for the analysis of 26 elements in archaeological ceramics and clays and the establishment of sample preparation protocols. The first project under taken involved analysis of over 1,000 samples from the Kythera Island Project, including pottery from excava tions at the multi-period site of Kastri and over 100 sites of all periods found in the survey, as well as geological samples from Kythera and neighbouring areas, and exper imental reconstructions of ancient fabrics. The current focus is on prehistoric material, to complement the already advanced pétrographie analysis. Chemical data confirm the continuous production of high-quality Minoan-style pottery in the vicinity of Kastri throughout the Middle and Late Bronze Age, including Late Minoan IB finewares. Future work will include comparative analysis first of Cretan products and clays, to document securely their differentiation, and secondly of contem porary materials from mainland centres where such pottery was probably traded. Archaeomaterials research at the Fitch now covers all periods from Neolithic to early modem and all regions of Greece, from the Ionian islands to the Cyclades, and from Macedonia and Thrace to Thessaly and the Peloponnese, including also neighbouring Bulgaria and Cypms. Building upon longstanding collaborations, the laboratory team has focused on large-scale diachronic studies of technological landscapes, mobility and connectivity. Four projects concern island connectivity, examining the ceramic landscapes of Kythera-Antikythera, Aegina and Kephallonia-Ithaki, and the metallurgical landscapes of the Cyclades. Two regional projects focus on issues of connectivity and technology transfer on the mainland during transitional phases, investigating transformations in potting traditions and networks in Thessaly from the Middle to Late Neolithic, and in central Macedonia during the Late Bronze to Early Iron Age transition and subse quent period of colonization. And a number of other smaller-scale and targeted studies (mostly associated with these major projects) shed light on various aspects of the history of Aegean and east Mediterranean landscapes. Within this wide range, space permits comment on just four projects, focusing on inorganic materials to complement last year's discussion of bioarchaeology.

Preparatory work involved setting up the project GIS, magnetometer and GPR survey, and kite photography, which produced a series of high-resolution vertical aerial images of the entire urban site (Fig. 11) to form the basis for a digital terrain model. Prospection also revealed a number of terraces, check-dams, enclosures and surface scatters variously dating from the end of the Neolithic to the modem period. These include a number of megalithic structures in the Sikia and Vayies zones, Final Neolithic/EMI scatters near Agios Nikolaos and Mycenaean surface scatters in the Kouremenos area. Finds include a fragment of a stone offering table with a Linear A inscription from the Petsophas peak sanctuary. Last but not least in this review of the School's archae ological research, Evi Margaritis completed her tenure as Leventis Fellow in February 2012. The major focus of her work was an ethnographical, experimental and archaeob otanical study of the domestication and intensive culti vation of the vine and the olive in the Aegean and Cyprus. Her successor, maritime archaeologist Chryssanthi Papadopoulou, took up her Fellowship in October 2012. Her doctoral thesis at King's College London was on The Navy in Fifth-century Athens: Evidence from Athenian Religion and she has excavated for many years with the Danish Institute team in Zea harbour. She will use her three-year Fellowship to investigate natural and cultural site formation processes on ancient shipwrecks, with particular reference to the fourth-century BC Mazotos wreck off the coast of Cypms, where she is a member of the excavation team under the direction of Stella Demesticha (University of Cypms). Among new School publications, three archaeological volumes have a strong Cretan focus, noting in particular Parallel Lives - the proceedings of a collaborative conference with the Universities of Crete and Cypms at which pairs of contributors were invited to share their views of the development of the two islands during given periods. The results of several School projects (especially conference volumes and studies devoted to more recent periods) also appear outside our main publication series. The latest example is Europe in Modern Greek History, edited by Kevin Featherstone of the London School of Economics, being the proceedings of our joint 2011 conference. The severe economic and organizational challenges to which the School continues to be exposed both in Greece and in Britain have also brought with them new opportu nities for academic collaboration, with strong incentives to explore synergies in research. This is especially evident in our research in Society, Arts and Letters. The British School at Athens is one of five overseas institutes supported by the British Academy. Together with our sister institutes in Rome, Ankara, the Levant (i.e. Amman, Jerusalem and Damascus) and Nairobi - and the British Institute for Persian Studies and the Society for Libyan Studies both temporarily operating from London - we are working to tell a powerful collective story of the quality and variety of research which we make possible across a wide geographical area (and of the vital role of Greece on this larger stage). The first of the BSA's shared research initiatives to secure funding is Balkan Futures, a collabo ration with the British Institute at Ankara and the École française d'Athènes, in association with the London School of Economics, which examines inter-regional 11.

Gaston). © BSA, Palaikastro Excavations. development and cooperation in southeast Europe in a period of crisis, rather than consolidation, in the EU. The project focuses on the roles and aspirations of Greece and Turkey in a region of which they form a key part, and on their bilateral relations which historically have played a major part in shaping Balkan identities. Our collaboration with the École française d'Athènes in history and anthro pology continued in April 2012 with a workshop on The Balkans: From Academic Field to International Politics - the first act in Balkan Futures. And in October, Ôzge Dilaver Kalkan (latterly of the University of Surrey) was appointed to a three-year research fellowship shared with the British Institute at Ankara. She will investigate the increasing trade flows and mobility of people between Thessaloniki and Istanbul, two cities which are now overcoming the historical and political tensions which had previously prevented their geographical proximity from being exploited to the full. Dr Dilaver Kalkan will inves tigate the socio-economic contexts and geographical patterns of these interactions, and build simulation models to enable scenario analyses. She will also run three project workshops in 2013-2014. Research into contemporary politics was also carried forward in the work of Early Career Fellow, Yannos Katsourides (latterly of the London School of Economics and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London) on the comparative evolution of right-wing political parties in Greece and Cyprus in the post-1974 era. Reflection on the School's historical role in Greece and its relationship with other institutions continues to inform our activities. Anglo-Hellenic relations was the theme of a conference in the Hellenic Parliament in November 2012, organized by the Hellenic Parliament Foundation in collaboration with the British Embassy and the School, which ranged widely over links in education, the development of parliamentarianism, trade, banking and shipping. In December 2012, we joined colleagues from the Centre for Byzantine Research of the Aristotle University and the Vafopouleio Cultural Centre of Thessaloniki in organizing an exhibition (and catalogue) of photographs from the School Archive's Byzantine Research Fund collection to celebrate the centenary of the city's incorporation into the Greek state (Fig. 12).

I will report fully next year on our conference on Byzantium and British Heritage held at King's College London on 4—6 September 2013 — the culmination of a research project led by the School archivist, Amalia Kakissis. The creative arts also flourish in the School. The Prince of Wales Bursary 2011-2012 was held by sculptor Garan Davis, a graduate of the Art Academy and the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London, who makes large-scale, mostly figurative work. While in Athens, he pursued a project on the potential of myth to capture the contemporary dilemmas and paradoxes of human nature. He created clay and wax models for a figurative sculpture rooted in Classical design (experimenting with Polykleitos' canon and contrapposto). The final work is intended to be copied freely and to evolve into a part of wider culture via use of online media to encourage people to create stories in the public domain, which can be adapted and freely developed by the participant community. Thus the art, and the story behind it, grow organically, emulating the way in which ancient Greek myths and works of art were conceived and honed. Garan Davis' successor, Sophie Michael, a London-based Anglo Cypriot photographer and film-maker, focused her residency largely in the school museum and has now completed her first work which has just had its first showing, as One Hundred Foot II, in Athens. In concluding, I touch upon a subject close to Hector Catling's heart, namely the teaching activity of the School. In August 2012 we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Undergraduate Summer School (Fig. 13). Begun in 1973, early in Dr Catling's directorship by then Assistant Director Robin Barber, the course has taught around a thousand students the archaeology and topography of Greece, has laid the foundation for numerous careers in Hellenic studies and for many participants has fostered a life-long interest in Greece, ancient and modern. On these foundations, we have developed our postgraduate programmes: courses in Greek epigraphy and ceramic petrology are now well established, a new course on Greek numismatics was taught in 2012 and another on Greek and Roman pottery, exploiting the rich collections held at Knossos, followed in 2013. These are truly international programmes (Fig. 14): the 11 students who took the 2012 ceramic petrology course came from eight different countries in Europe and North America, and formed a multi-cultural group of young scholars from very different academic backgrounds, carrying out research on different regions and periods, from Neolithic pottery at Çatalhôyiik to Hellenistic wares in Afghanistan, and from Roman amphorae in the west Mediterranean to the early colonial pottery of Madagascar.

New sites were investigated and new museums opened their doors, with a host of conservators and designers deployed to support them. That was before the economic downturn of 2008 and the consequent contraction of fieldwork, of professional and technical staff, and of research services in general. The fruits of the 'remarkable decade' are nevertheless continuing to appear in books and journals. Robert Pitt provided the first glimpse of these developments in his report on Athens and Attica (AR 57 [2010-2011] 31-48), drawing on the first fascicule of volumes 56-59 [2001-2004] of ADelt, to which archaeologists are required to report their work in the year in which it took place. ADelt is a necessarily cumbersome and slow publi cation, whose future is uncertain, as Cathy Morgan explained in her introduction to AG 2009-2010 (AR 56 [2009-2010] 1). The complexity of the process of collating, editing, and publishing archaeological work, of all periods, in a single book seems even less viable today as government budgets have become tightly constrained. In the case of research projects, annual reports are now frequently available online. In ,47? 58 [2011-2012] contri butors to AG explored the contents of the then Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports' illus trated e-book www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes. This provides a well-rounded view of the decade's activities, and in a form that is accessible to a much wider public than the printed volumes of ADelt. For the present, the latter nevertheless remains the principal source of published data, alongside the regional annuals and journals that have sprung up to fill the chronological gap between editions of ADelt, and to allow wider and more detailed coverage of individual sites and projects. ADelt was designed to provide a syste matic conspectus of activities, not a set of full and detailed reports. The pattern of information that becomes available on an annual basis to AG is therefore constrained, oscil lating between punctuated, detailed reports, issued separately or in the various regional publications but which cover only some aspects of the overall scope of fieldwork in any one year, and the comprehensive reviews for each Ephoreia in ADelt, where space constraints radically reduce the quantity of data that can be included for any one project. As a result, reports in ADelt can sometimes be hard to fathom. There are important and distinctive entries; but readers who have little understanding of the Greek text or who are unfamiliar with the local geography and nomen clature may find these hard to follow. Successive site reports can come to resemble white noise. 'White noise' is an acoustic phenomenon that makes it difficult to distin guish individual sounds - a signal with constant power density, which the ear detects as a uniform hissing noise. This is the same sort of phenomenon that used to result in television screens becoming covered by a uniform pattern of seemingly random dots. The listener or viewer cannot detect any difference between signals. In archaeological terms, the reader cannot really understand what makes one report different from another, and thus is unable to evaluate what is more important or more relevant. ADelt entries often require some additional information, particu larly for anyone unfamiliar with local and regional geography, in order to be decoded. By the time that entries are collated by the BSA and EfA and published online the data are accompanied by links to maps, plans and images. One of the aims of AGOnline is to enable researchers to get the full benefit of all the infor mation that filters through from field projects, including links to online resources and to other publications, as well as to enable access to the full range of data that is made accessible by the Ministry of Culture and Sport. AGOnline (www.chronique.efa.gr) provides an up-to date database of field and site reports for Greece (since 2009), with new publications issued since then taking records back to 2000 and in some cases to 1999. Reports are logged by the activity year, although the reports themselves may have appeared in print or online some time after this date. References in A G to online data are signalled by the prefix ID and a number which can be used as a direct search criterion within AGOnline. At the level of the individual site, online entries provide the widest range of information available at any one time. The challenge for scholars is to understand how to relate these isolated bits of information to other data. One the of the aims of AG is to try and reduce any impression of 'white noise' that the unsuspecting researcher may hazard upon by isolating sets of data that can be studied together, so as to develop coherent narra tives, whether chronologically, thematically or by region. This year the publication of the next fascicles of ADelt (56-59 [2001-2004]) has greatly expanded the scope of material that can now be studied more closely in a number of regions. Compared with the last year in which this range was available - with the publication of ADelt 55 (2000) (see AR 56 [2009-2010]) - the sheer number of sites reported on, as well as the associated data, exceeds, by a considerable margin (as might be expected from the first new crop of reports on Athens and Attica), what was contained in that publication, only three years ago. This is the real meat of the 'remarkable decade'. It also makes the task of assessing the data that is being processed for online transmission quite a challenging one. The time available for preparing our contributions has been limited, and by no means all regions covered in ADelt 56-59 (2001-2004) are acces sible online at the time of writing. As anyone who has taken the trouble to sift through volumes of ADelt knows, it is all too easy to get lost in the data. This compilation exists for reasons other than the enlightenment and edifi cation of scholars. It is a formal demonstration of tasks</page><page sequence="12">12 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD accomplished and budgets expended. Entries vary consi derably in terms of the range and quality of information provided. Sometimes this reflects the difficulty of inter preting what was found or the conditions of recovery. In order to put the contents of ADelt entries into context, this year's reports in AG provide a selection of topics and areas that draw on data that is currently available in online reports and, in some cases, directly from translations of ADelt entries, circulated in advance of online publication to our contributors by the BSA and EfA. Our approach is therefore different from the last major review of material from the whole of Greece, in AR 56 (2009-2010). It is not physically possible to synthesize the contents in one volume of AR and maintain coherence. The raw data compiled by the two schools cover many hundreds of pages for the six ADelt fascicules covering the years 2001-2004. Since we must be selective, this edition of AG delves deeper into the available material by looking at three distinct regions and at three chronological periods, in two cases spanning large territorial units. In the following chapters, I present an overview of recent research in mainland Greece. David Smith looks at the Greek mainland, from the Palaeolithic through to the Late Bronze Age, and spanning the whole of peninsular Greece, exploring the emerging evidence from the last decade in the context of current scholarship. Maria Stamatopoulou provides an extended summary of the latest findings published in the annual review of archaeo logical research in Thessaly, AEThSE 3, as well as a number of important recent conferences. This chapter complements her contribution to last year's AG. The following two chapters, by John Bennet and Matthew Haysom, look at Crete, in prehistoric times and through the first millennium BC respectively. The maps that accompany these chapters provide comparative distribu tions of those sites discussed in AG 2011-2012 with those of 2012-2013. My survey of the islands attempts to provide a broad view of significant work in the Aegean islands, from Lemnos in the northwest to Rhodes in the southeast. This is also intended to complement Alexander Mazarakis Ainian's presentation of current research on cult structures and practices in the Cycladic islands during the Archaic period. Finally, Rebecca Sweetman surveys the Late Antique period in the Greek Aegean, illuminating the newly available data in the light of current academic frameworks. All the contributors have something to say about how their topics and areas of study are being examined, in terms of intellectual approaches as well as in relation to the study of material remains. Since this is a selection, there are regions and periods that are not covered in this edition. Future editions of^G will return to a more systematic examination of Athens and Attica, of central Greece, the Peloponnese, Macedonia and Thrace. There is a conscious intention to try and serve the needs of our different audiences. What does the reader of JHS, for example, want from a review of archaeological activity in Greece? One of the innovations of the current volume is the inclusion of maps and of a more structured selection of images. The complexity of commissioning new maps to match the texts of individual chapters has meant that not all chapters have maps that precisely reflect the place-names referred to. Despite this, I believe that the maps will help readers to make connections between the factual content and the associated locations, and thus to move more easily from the familiar to the unfamiliar. AN OVERVIEW OF RECENT RESEARCH IN MAINLAND GREECE Zosia Archibald Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool The selection of sites below reflects some of the most distinctive additions of 2012, arranged according to a number of themes, which reflect a dominant and conti nuing interest in sites that illuminate the urban and civic characteristics of archaeological locations in mainland Greece. Athens and Attica Among the important discoveries of 2012 was the prehis toric stone pile and chamber tomb cut into bedrock at the Early Helladic cemetery of Asteria (ID3306), near Glyphada, Attica, which is discussed by David Smith below. The tomb was repeatedly reused: it contained one strongly contracted skeleton in front of the door and a pile of bones in the east half of the chamber representing at least 20 individuals (17 adults and three children). M. Pantelidou Gofa (ASA) reports on the 2012 season at Tsepi, Marathon, where a new deposit was investigated outside tomb 39, as well as two new tombs, 56 and 58 (ID3311), noting that Tomb 56 has all the known charac teristics of the Tsepi tombs: rectangular with a built chamber, walls and threshold. In the Athenian Agora, investigations continued in 2012 of the Hellenistic and Classical road levels of the Panathenaic Way. John Camp reports the following on behalf of the ASCSA (ID2893, cf. ID2471). In Section BE, more stone sockets for wooden posts were revealed, which belonged to aperischoinisma (roped enclosure: estimated at ca. 12 by 15m) attested in the area by Plutarch (Moralia 847a) and recognized during excavation by the 1st EPCA in the bed of the HZ An railway line in 2010-2011 (ID 2477). The most substantial surface dates to the fourth century BC. As restored, nine posts were set along the north and south sides, and eight along the east and west. Many must have been used to support the ikria, wooden grandstands set along the Panathenaic Way for spectators to observe the procession (Athenaeus 4.167ffl). In Section BH, well M 2:1 (at the extreme eastern edge of the section) was explored to its full depth of ca. 12m. The upper part was stone-lined and reused in the Byzantine period. The contents of the fill included abundant pottery of forms characteristic of the fourth and fifth centuries AD. Well M 2:1 predates the arrival of Alaric and the Visigoths in AD 396 and was in use while the building still functioned as a public stoa. The abundance of pitchers, mugs and amphorae in both wells studied suggests that rooms created by walling up the open colonnades may have served as taverns or wine shops. The well-preserved east wall of the Painted Stoa (Fig. 15), of greyish-tan limestone, was revealed at the extreme east end of the excavated section. At least six orthostat blocks are preserved in situ, three from the outer row and three from the inner. The joints within each row are held by iron double-T clamps 0.21m long, set in lead, while the inner and outer rows are not clamped to each other. The wall construction is very similar to that of the contem porary Cnidian Lesche at Delphi, which was also decorated with paintings by Polygnotos of Thasos.

Athenian coins had a bull. A bull's head also appears on Wappenmunzen. The coin was minted under Peisistratos and contemporary silver didrachms, including those with a bull's head, are dated between 546-518 BC. Further down in the same area were several early, separate pottery deposits of the seventh, early sixth and early fifth centuries BC. The seventh-century material is especially rare and included the rim of a bowl decorated with a lion. Excavation in Section B0 East continued within several rooms of the Byzantine period. The upper parts of Byzantine walls exposed in Section B0 West define several rooms with at least two periods of construction (of the 11th century AD). 16.

Rescue excavation by the 3rd EPCA at 7 Porinou Street, Makrigianni, Athens, revealed a well-preserved bath complex in use from the second to the seventh century AD. A large number of coins was recovered, as well as fragments of glass and ceramic vessels, and lamps. Three marble male heads (one an Apollo type) probably formed part of the interior decoration (ID2894).

At Thouria in the Peloponnese, Xeni Arapogianni (ASA) continued excavations, during 2012, at the Doric temple dedicated to Asklepios and Hygieia. Two statue bases were found to the right of the temple entrance, dedicated by Damophantos and Nikandria to their two sons, Damotheles and Euthymos (ID3314, cf. ID2565; cf. also AR 56 [2009-2010] 50 with plan) (Fig. 27). The portable finds consisted mainly of Hellenistic (fourth- to second-century BC) pottery, particularly moulded bowls, two bronze coins (one Messinean of the third century BC), a few bone astragaloi and one in glass, and a black-glazed sherd with an incomplete graffito: ... AAni, probably from ASKAAnmi. At another Peloponnesian shrine, that of Artemis Lykoatis, at Arachamitai, Agia Paraskevi, Bjorn Forsén (Finnish Institute) reports on continued excavation of a Late Hellenistic rectangular building (RB I), measuring ca. 45 by 11m and (with the exception of the westernmost room) having two rows of rooms running along its length, separated by a longitudinal east-west wall. Debris from a destruction deposit can be dated to the late first century BC (ID3257). The evidence includes a Lakonian coin of 48-35 BC found between the roof tiles. The coin lay above Room 9, which also provided a sequence of pottery from the late fourth until the late first century BC, as well as 16 coins (spanning the period between the late third and late first centuries BC, with one Megalopolitan coin of ca. 363-350 BC). There was similar dating evidence in Room 10. Next to RB I, and probably extending beneath it, was the floor of an earlier building. At Nemea, Kim Shelton (ASCSA/Berkeley) conducted a third and final season of excavation at the Heroon (ID2965). The aim of the project has been to gain a better understanding of the early (prehistoric and pre-Hellenistic) phases of the area in the immediate vicinity and what this can tell us about the establishment of a hero cult. Mycenaean pottery was recovered, though whether this is an early association of cult activity with this area remains to be seen. Late Helladic pottery was found below a layer of Archaic sherds, beginning in the late eighth or early seventh century and continuing thereafter. Initial cult activity seems to focus on the southeastern part of the precinct. At Isthmia, Elizabeth Gebhard (ASCSA/Chicago) reports on the study of terracottas from the sanctuary in 2012. Terracotta votives, particularly the popular horse and-rider groups, were common in the second half of the seventh century, following construction of the first temple ca. 650BC, and again in the second half of the sixth century, when the Isthmian Games gained Panhellenic recognition. Terracotta votives in general, and this popular form in particular, disappeared after ca. 390BC, when a fire caused extensive destruction in the sanctuary. It is still puzzling why such votive practices were not re established thereafter (ID2969). Activity at the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia in 2012, directed by Reinhard Senff (DAI), focused on the southeast area of the sanctuary, last investigated in 2008 and 2011 (1D2973).

A variety of metal artefacts was discovered - mainly iron objects, together with some sheet bronze, including an Archaic Gorgoneion shield device (Fig. 28), furniture (Fig. 29) and utensils. The northeast corner of the gymnasium (excavated in 1880 and 1936, and subse quently buried) and the passage between the east and north stoas were cleaned, in cooperation with the 7th EPCA, in preparation for the planned excavation of the gymnasium.

MAINLAND GREECE (PREHISTORIC) David Smith School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool Introduction The absence of the prehistoric Peloponnese and central Greece from last year's new format Archaeology in Greece has provided a slightly larger volume of data for this year's report than might otherwise have been expected, although the ongoing financial difficulties faced by Greece and the recent uncertainty over the status of the Archaeological Service itself continue to have a substantial impact on archaeological research and its dissemination through traditional channels; a problem which e-publication and webcasting is going some way toward addressing. In light of this, the decennial volume of the former Ministry of Culture and Tourism (www. yppo.gr/O/anaskafes), the appearance of which was noted in last year's AG, represents a welcome summary of excavation undertaken by the service between 2000 and 2010 to add to the newly-published volume of ADelt covering the Peloponnese. Some of this work has previ ously been reported in AG, although this is certainly not true of all. Several other publications have appeared since 2011 which offer new data or new perspectives on the prehistory of the Greek mainland, several of which are discussed below. Of particular note are two volumes which will go some considerable way toward furthering our understanding of the Early Bronze Age in southern Greece: Daniel Pullen's The Early Bronze Age Village on Tsoungiza Hill (2011) and Elizabeth Banks' The Architecture, Settlement and Stratigraphy of Lerna IV (2013), the companion piece to Jeremy Rutter's 1995 volume detailing the pottery from the Early Helladic III settlement. Banks' volume, unfortunately, has appeared too late to be properly incorporated into this year's AG. Elsewhere, excavations by the late Spyridon Iakovides (ASA) in the Southwestern Quarter at Mycenae have been published (Iakovides [2013]), while the results of the 1986 excavations at Chaeronea have also been presented (Tzavella-Evjen 2012), accompanied by a synthesis of data from the early investigations of Georgios Soteriades. The Early Bronze Age also forms the focus of two recent conference publications. Helike IV. Ancient Helike and Aigialeia. Protohelladika. The Southern and Central Greek Mainland (Katsonopoulou [2011a]) includes 18 papers delivered at Nikolaiika in Achaea in September 2007. Many of the contributions collected here are, as one might expect, concerned with the site of Helike itself, although the adoption of a wider geographical scope permits discussion of recent work undertaken at sites across the mainland, as well as at Kolonna, on Aegina, and at several sites on Poros. A much more restricted geographical focus is evident in the published proceedings of the round table Early Helladic Laconia held at the Netherlands Institute at Athens in January 2010, which has appeared as a special edition of Pharos, the Journal of the Netherlands Institute at Athens (volume 18.1 [2011-2012]), under the editorship of Christopher Mee and Mieke Prent. Contributions here include new Early Helladic material from Kouphovouno, Geraki and Pavlopetri, as well as discussion of broader regional devel opments in the Eurotas valley and the Helos plain.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 23 jJt—ί ίο 100 200km I I I Map 2.

Late Neolithic remains are reported from Pharsala, Vasills (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 160), Astritsa (ID1106; www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 162) and Zevgarolivado (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 164), while at Koutroulou Magoula excavation of the 'corridor-like feature' identified in 2011 (ID2762) revealed it to be the dromos of a Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age tholos tomb, looted in antiquity (1D2902) (Fig. 31). In southern Greece, Franchthi (ID2967) remains the most important site for our understanding of the Early Neolithic period, and continued analysis of the complex Final Mesolithic and Initial Neolithic faunal record of the cave is helping to shed light on the changes that charac terize the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition. A very rapid replacement of red deer by domestic sheep and goats during the earliest Initial Neolithic suggests that domestic caprines were introduced to the site from elsewhere during this period and immediately became the principal source of meat for Franchthi's inhabitants. Below the cave, under water survey in the Bay of Koilada (ID2903), mounted in advance of excavation by the EMA and the Swiss School at Athens, is intended to trace the largely submerged Neolithic settlement partly exposed during earlier excava tions on the Franchthi paralia. Similarly, at Diros excavation, geophysical prospection and surface survey are helping to reconcile activity in the Alepotrypa Cave with contemporary occupation on the promontory beyond its entrance and with an extensive open-air settlement on the nearby acropolis of Xagounaki (ID2912; www.fieldmuseum.org/ explore/gis-diros-project-greece). A substantial pottery assemblage and a large number of tools have been identified, while a double child enchytrismos and a triple adult burial of probable Final Neolithic date are also reported. The absence of any post-Neolithic material at Xagounaki is no doubt indicative of the very close connection between the use of this open-air site and that of the cave. Although the function of walls such as those identified at Final Neolithic Palioskala remains uncertain (ID1037, ID1038; Souvatzi [2008]), it is hard to imagine that the substantial Final Neolithic Wall 31 identified beneath the Early Helladic fortification at Geraki is anything but 31. Koutroulou Magoula: Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age tholos tomb. © BSA. defensive (MacVeagh Thorne [2011-2012]; see also Crouwel [2011-2012]). The wall itself measures at least 1.7m in width and the identification of architectural parallels from Attica finds support in the presence at Geraki of pottery characteristic of the Aégina-Attica Kephala koine. The discovery of this wall, the first of its kind in the Peloponnese, demonstrates clearly the unsettled nature of the socio-political landscape of Final Neolithic Lakonia. Early Bronze Age While the chamber tomb cemeteries at Elis (ID337, ID2507; see also Rambach [2007]) and Kalamaki Elaiochori (Vasilogamvrou [1996-1997]) provide valuable insight into Early Helladic I funerary practices in the northwest Peloponnese, settlement architecture of the period, as elsewhere in southern Greece, remains extremely rare. As a result, the identification of a large (10.7 by 5.5m) rectangular Early Flelladic I building at Teichos Dymalon (ID3912), in the northwest of the area enclosed by the Late Helladic IIIB enceinte, is most welcome. Much about the earlier occupation of the site remains unclear, although it seems certain that a substantial Early to Middle Helladic settlement preceded the Mycenaean presence on the acropolis (cf. Gazis</page><page sequence="26">26 DAVID SMITH [2010]). To the east, the distribution of EHI material at Aigeira suggests occupation across the entire plateau, although later Mycenaean occupation has removed any trace of buildings. Strategically placed on a route leading to the Pheneos valley, pottery from the site indicates contact with contemporary settlements in the eastern Corinthian Gulf (Alram-Stern [2011]). The site was abandoned during EHII, at which point a new settlement was established at Kassaneva, along with three more in the area of Vlachos and four at Ambelokopi in the Krios valley (ID147). Several EHII rooms have come to light at the coastal site of Derveni, some 5km east of Aigeira (ID2497; see also Sarri [2011]). Built of unworked stones, surviving walls vary in width between ca. 0.5 and 0.7m and preserve traces of plaster. Additional walls running beneath these remains on a different alignment are evidence of an earlier building phase at the site. Plaster-lined bothroi and the remains of numerous pithoi are attested, as well as sauceboats, cooking vessels and obsidian tools. A number of rectangular and apsidal EHII buildings discovered at Aigion are discussed by Lena Papazoglou-Manioudaki [2010]. An incised stone vessel from the site indicates an ability to access Cycladic trade networks, while an antler seal may indicate involvement in a more complex system of exchange. Two EHII buildings are also reported at Lappa (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes: 101). The first is trapezoidal in plan and measures ca. 8.2 by 7m, while the plan of the second could not be recovered. Both had been destroyed by fire. This emerging picture of Early Helladic Achaea has been brought into sharp relief by excavations at Helike (Katsonopoulou [2011b]) which have revealed a major settlement of rectangular buildings organized around a series of open spaces and cobbled streets (1.2-2.5m wide), with evidence of occupation during Early Helladic II and EHIII. The identification of a probable corridor building here is thus far unique for Achaea (Fig. 32). A reliance on flint for tool production may argue against close involvement with Cycladic networks, although analysis of the ceramic assemblage indicates contact with other parts of the mainland. Intriguingly, there is no evidence at present to suggest a break in occupation at the end of EHII. In Attica, a substantial chamber tomb cemetery is reported at Glyphada on the Pounda peninsula (ID 1729, ID1763, ID2468). Slabs of locally-sourced stone were used to cover the chambers and block the entrance. At the surface, these graves are defined by well-built rectangular períbolos walls (Fig. 33). All contained multiple burials, with earlier remains selectively redeposited in side chambers. Offerings include pottery, beads, shells and, in one case, a Cycladic marble figurine. A short distance to the northeast, excavation of a large circular pit (ca. 8m in diameter) revealed an assemblage of 250 vessels, including phialae, krateriskoi, one-handled cups and pyxides, which are probably to be connected with one or more episodes of funerary ritual. To the southeast, beyond the períbolos wall which delineated the cemetery at the seaward side, a large stone mound (ca. 9 by 6m) built of pebbles and medium-sized stones yielded Early Helladic I sherds and an assemblage of grinding and percussion tools of ophite, andésite and sandstone alongside other worked pebbles, perhaps indicating the presence of a workshop nearby (ID3306) (Fig. 34). ·. ί 32.

Excavations at Tsepi during 2012 focused on Tombs 56 and 58 and on a ceramic deposit associated with Tomb 39 (ID3311). The construction of Tomb 56 is typical of others from the cemetery, comprising a rectangular built chamber roofed with three schist slabs and closed by a single further upright. The final interment was positioned in front of the entrance and at least 10 further burials are represented by disarticulated remains. The tomb is dated to Early Helladic I by a small ceramic assemblage. More unusual is Tomb 58, which seems to represent an earlier tomb cleared and reused for secondary burial. At least 13 crania were identified within the upper layers of the chamber, while lower layers contained largely long bones. Bones from the feet were deposited to the right of the entrance and those of the hands to the left, with smaller bones concentrated toward the centre. Grave goods include a stone palette and cosmetic pigment, four bone pigment grinders and an assemblage of stone beads, of which one is phalliform and another is carved in the shape of a bird. A stone seal and a probable shark tooth, both pierced for suspension, likely derive from the same piece of jewellery (Fig. 35). The deposit associated with Tomb 39 included skyphoi, amphoriskoi and pithoid vessels, broken in situ and covered with stones at some point during the early use of the cemetery. The identification of three EHII trapezoidal built graves of the type known from Tsepi at Styra on Euboea (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 55) suggests that the site was in contact with the east Attic coast across the South Euboean Gulf. It is clear that maritime communication played a major role at Romanou in Messenia (ID2571) where rescue excavations by the 38th EPCA have revealed a substantial Early Helladic II settlement (Fig. 36). A recent summary of this work presented by Jdrg Rambach is available online through the ASCSA (http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/ index.php/news/newsDetails/videocast-recent-prehistoric finds-at-the-costa-navarino-resort-in-messenia/). The site has yielded the remains of a copper workshop, while obsidian tool manufacture on a massive scale is attested by an assemblage of over 10,000 flakes, tools and cores. Excavation of a well in the east of the site yielded an assemblage of over 200 EHII vessels, many of them intact or nearly so, while a large pit (ca. 15 by 10m) in the west was found to contain a huge volume of pebbles, pottery and animal bones, including a large number of cattle horns, which perhaps represent the remains of a communal feasting event. Analysis of pottery from Romanou indicates contact with the Cyclades and Crete, perhaps via Kythera, while storage pithoi have yielded what appear to be carbonized figs and a large number of grape pits, the earliest yet identified in Messenia. A looted Late Helladic I tholos was also identified in the southwest of the site. Although many of the principal features of the site are already known from preliminary reports, the compre hensive final volume on the Final Neolithic and Early Helladic I—III settlements at Tsoungiza (Pullen [2011]) makes clear that despite its position as a relatively small inland settlement, Tsoungiza was capable of connecting with the wider Aegean, albeit perhaps indirectly. Melian obsidian comprises some 90% of EHII Developed lithic material at the site (Karabatsoli [2011] 662), while very 35. Marathon, Tsepi: beads from Tomb 58. © ASA. 36. Romanou: the western area of the EHII settlement. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 38th EPCA. low numbers of ceramic imports attest to limited contact with sites beyond the Argolid-Corinthia during the period. Laurion ores account for the majority of EHII metal finds from the site, however one copper needle of EHII Developed and another belonging to EHIII match the lead isotope composition of ores from the Limassol Forest on Cyprus, and a third, as yet unknown, source has also been identified (Kayafa et al. [2011] 658). The clarification of the Early Helladic ceramic sequence at Tsoungiza, and particularly the identification of a transitional EHI-II phase, EHII Initial, represents an important contribution to our understanding of the Nemea valley during the period. Pattern-painted pottery of the EHIII period from Tsoungiza demonstrates close links with the EHIII settlement at Lerna to the south, the final report of which, as noted above, has now appeared in print (Banks [2013]). While the publication of the Early Helladic III settle ments at Lema and Tsoungiza represents a major boon for those with an interest in the period, unstratified EHIII material such as that reported from the Drouza plot at Iria (ID3878) is unfortunately far more typical of those sites with evidence for activity during the late Early Helladic. At Atalanti, Early Helladic remains are reported on the property of D. Ioannou (ID3494), while an EHIII burial tumulus is reported from the Kokoretsi plot (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 59). The edge of the tumulus is defined by a períbolos wall of large unworked stones, while the interior is filled with small and medium-sized stones. The diameter of the tumulus is estimated at ca. 15m, although much of the structure had been destroyed</page><page sequence="28">28 DAVID SMITH by later building and only ca. 25% of the total was inves- Street (ID3864).

Two Middle Helladic I—II Mycenae (Fig. 38). This find brings Sparta in line with pithos burials at the S. Thanou plot (ID3884) containing developments seen elsewhere in the Peloponnese during multiple burials and a small assemblage of principally the earlier shaft-grave period. A number of other graves 'Adriatic-style' vessels are typical of other contemporary are reported in the vicinity, of which Tomb 8, a stone-built pithos burials found east of the Aspis, while clusters of pit cist containing a child burial, has parallels in the MHIII to and cist graves like those excavated at 162 Herakleous LHI cist tomb cemetery at Agios Vasileios (ID2322). The Street (ID3836) immediately south of the Argos Hospital burials at Sparta appear to overlie the remains of a site (Papadimitriou [2010]) are more characteristic of later settlement belonging to the earliest phases of the Middle Middle Helladic practices. To the east, on Nauplion Street, Helladic, a period which has previously been extremely excavation at the Koutroubi plot has identified walls of the poorly represented in the region.

(ID3483), zoomorphic figurines and a bronze spear are reported among fragmentary walls and an assemblage of matt-painted and Minyan pottery, while the recovery of a matt-painted bowl beneath late Middle Helladic and early Late Helladic remains at the Vouvaloudi plot (ID3484) indicates an earlier phase of occupation during Early Helladic III. Middle and Late Helladic pottery recovered from earlier excavation at the Voultsidi plot has recently been discussed by Eleni Phroussou (2010), while a Late Helladic cist containing a skull and the remains of a small child has come to light close to the church of Agios Georgios (ID3485). A substantial Middle Helladic settlement has been excavated on the northern coast of the Corinthian Gulf at the Ramakou plot, Paralia Tolophonos (www.yppo.gr/ O/anaskafes: 52). A layer of ash, burnt human and animal bone and pottery indicates a violent destruction before the end of the Middle Helladic. To the east at Kirrha on the Gulf of Itea (ID797, ID1361, ID1949, 1D2646) a programme of excavation, topographical survey and geophysical investigation recently completed by the 10th EPCA and the EfA has identified an abandonment of the western part of the settlement (Areas 2 and 3) at the end of Middle Helladic II as a result of earthquake activity. At the same time, a new settlement was founded deeper into the Pleistos valley at Agios Georgios, and others appear further west along the coastline at Nafpaktos (see AR 57 [2010-2011] 23). The existence of an overland network linking Thessaly and central Greece during the Middle Helladic has recently been discussed by Fanouria Dakoronia [2010]. Pottery from Kirrha indicates contact with Aegina, Thessaly and the Sperchios valley, where recent excavation at the known prehistoric site of Lianokladhi has identified several rectangular Middle Helladic buildings with in situ storage vessels and an intramural pit burial, as well as an assemblage of Minyan and Aip class pottery (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes: 57-58) (Fig. 39). Like Lianokladhi, the Middle Helladic settlement at Diasergiani-Stroggylorachi (ID3556) appears to have been abandoned prior to the beginning of the Late Helladic period. Elsewhere in the valley, Middle Helladic remains have recently been reported from Kastro Lamia (ID1992; see also Stamoudi [2010]) and Amouri (Papakonstantinou and Sakkas [2010]). Late Bronze Age One of the defining characteristics of the Late Bronze Age on the mainland is the appearance and development of fresco art, and a very considerable amount of energy has been expended over the last decade in the identification, analysis, conservation and consolidation of the known mainland corpus. With additional examples continuing to appear from storerooms, and from excavations at both known sites and new, it seems appropriate now to attempt a summary of some recent developments. At Mycenae excavations continued in 2012 at the Petsas House and the East House (ID3312). The Petsas House appears to have been used for storage, and perhaps for the production of pottery and figurines, prior to its destruction in Late Helladic IIIA2. However, fresco fragments have been noted from Room T and Room H, the latter apparently deriving from one or more finely decorated rooms on the upper floor (Fig. 40). Additional fragments are also reported from other rooms identified in the Lower Town (ID1430, ID2082). At Midea (ID2402), the recording and restoration of wall-paintings recovered during the recent Greek-Swedish excavations directed by Katie Demakopoulou (National Museum) is ongoing.

At least one chariot wheel has been identified (AR 57 [2010—2011] 23), while other small-scale fragments of probable Late Helladic IIIA date depict a female figure within a building, reminiscent of the battle scene from the megaron at Mycenae (Fig. 42), and the greaved leg of a warrior. Test trenches to the west of Building B have identified an apparent dump containing further fragments variously depicting griffins and other animals, a rocky landscape, floral motifs, spiral motifs and dentil patterns (ID2322). In the associated cemetery, Chamber Tomb A appears to have been used as a dump following the collapse of its roof and has yielded additional examples of painted plaster (ID2322). The paintings from Agios Vasileios are particularly significant given the poor survival, and relative indecipherability, of painted plaster from the Menelaion (see Catling [2009] 302-12). At Thebes, excavations at 27-29 Antigonis Street have revealed a southern extension to the Mycenaean palatial complex (ID3096). Two successive floor levels were identified, each resting on a layer of mortar, of which the lowest was found to contain fresco fragments. Another substantial complex is noted at 3 Eurydike Street (Kadmeia). Apparently destroyed by fire during the mid 13th century BC, the central area of this structure yielded fresco fragments, as well as the remains of a terracotta bathtub. Further fragments of painted wall-plaster were recovered from a second room to the north (ID800). These fragments can be added to the already substantial number identified during previous excavation on the Kadmeia, depicting warriors, female procession, seascapes and hunting scenes among a variety of other motifs, some recently analysed by Ann Brysbaert ([2008]; for refer ences, see Dakouri-Hild [2010] 700). The recent discovery of Aegean-style paintings from Tell Kabri in Israel (Cline et al. [2011]) is a clear reminder of the potential importance of fresco art, as with other forms of craft and material culture, to the identifi cation of contact between groups over distance. A considerable number of Late Helladic burials have been reported from the mainland and particularly from the northwest Peloponnese. In Elis, a large Late Helladic IIIA2-C chamber tomb is reported from Kafkania containing successive layers of rich offerings and, unusually, a female skull preserving a diadem of blue glass beads in situ (ID2508) (Fig. 43). A roughly similar diadem is noted from Stravokephalo by Kostas Nikolenztos [2011], who also discusses previously unpublished material from the cemeteries at Diasella, Makrisia and the New Museum. A Late Helladic IIA-IIIA2 tholos tomb and its associated settlement are reported from Triantaphyllia (ID2509) (Fig. 44), while another very large tholos has been excavated at Vartholomio-Katsiveri (ID1896). A group of 92 LHIIIB-C vessels has been recovered from Tomb 13 of the LHIII chamber tomb cemetery at Trypes (ID1518). A pictorial amphora decorated with an ekphora scene was excavated from the dromos of Tomb 8 at the same site (ID323), while the deposition of an imitation Late Cypriot hom-shaped vessel in Tomb 10 is sympto matic of the increased contact visible between Cyprus and 42.

Some 15km northwest, warrior burials are reported from two tombs in the chamber tomb cemetery at Mageira (ID1899). Multiple swords and a pair of bronze greaves are reported among the grave goods, while two anthropomorphic beads are noted among the offerings from other tombs at the site. Weapons are reported from the recently-published cemetery at Mitopoli some 20km southwest of Patras (Christakopoulou-Somakou [2010]). Noteworthy among an assemblage of swords, daggers and arrowheads are a spearhead preserving part of its wooden shaft and an intact bronze spear-butt dated to early to mid Late Helladic IIIC from Tomb 4 and the remains of a boar's tusk helmet of probable LHIIIA1-2 date from Tomb 5. At Leontio, new tombs have been identified in the LHIIIB-C chamber tomb cemetery at Vragiannika (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B4, 546; see also Giannopoulos [2008]), all but one looted in antiquity.

The discovery of Late Helladic graves at Damasta (ID3547) and the excavation of an Late Helladic IIB-IIIC chamber tomb cemetery at Kompotades (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes: 61-62), as well as the prelim inary publication of contemporary settlements at the nearby sites of Phrantzis and Lygaria (Karantzali [2013]) represent an important contribution to the study of the later Mycenaean landscape of the Sperchios valley. The settlement at Phrantzis was occupied at least as early as Middle Helladic II and Lygaria from the Middle Helladic to LHI transition. Both were apparently small settlements in which Mycenaean pottery styles were amalgamated with local tastes and at which true imports are rare. Both were destroyed roughly contemporaneously in LHIIIB2-IIIC Early at a time when other sites in the valley were also abandoned. References Alram-Stern, Ε.

The publication contains many very interesting articles on Thessaly that demonstrate the vitality and variety of the archaeological work (fieldwork, research and archival studies) conducted in the region, often under difficult circumstances. Although it has often been pointed out (during the conferences) that these meetings have become almost unmanageable, due to the very large number of participants (the volume on Thessaly is over 700 pages long), their importance is obvious. The regularity of the meetings and their prompt publication have increased our essential evidence for the region, but also enable scholars to draw comparisons and discern links among sites and between classes of material, and to illus trate the diachronic importance of key sites in the Thessalian landscape, thus adding greatly to our under standing of the region synchronically and diachronically. As a number of articles from this volume were the focus of last year's report (for example: Roman Demetrias: Triantaphylopoulou [2012]; Kastro/Palaia Volou: Skafida [2012]; Phthiotic Thebes/Nea Anchialos: Dina [2012]; Tempe: Sdrolia [2012b]; Toufexis et al. [2012b]; fortification walls of Late Roman Larisa: Kontogiannopoulou [2012]; Kazanaki: Stantzouris and Panagiotis [2012]), I will concentrate here on new sites/material for reasons of brevity. Although very important, due to the constraints of space I will not discuss in this brief report the papers on archival material or the history of collections (Helly et al. [2012]; Stamatopoulou [2012]), synthetic and theoretical analyses of historical periods and texts (Gounaris [2012]; Kravaritou [2012]; Bizaki [2012]), a paper on museum educational programmes (Kalogianni and Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2012]) or epigraphic studies that do not relate directly to material culture. I will also leave for next year the overview of early poleis/settlements in Thessaly from the Mycenaean to the Archaic period and the discussion of issues such as continuity from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Age (key sites such as Halos/Voulokalyva and its cemeteries, Kastro/Palaia Volou, Aerino, Pherae, Pharsalos, Agios Georgios/Krannon and Sarantaporo). I shall begin this report with a brief presentation of other recent publications, exhibitions and conferences on Thessalian antiquities and then discuss the new finds in broad chronological terms and, for the first millennium BC, according to regions/major cities. Recent publications The Archaeological Institute of Thessalian Studies, under its current director Elisavet Nikolaou, has been very active in publishing important new studies on Thessaly, central Greece and Macedonia. The following concern Thessaly: Nikolaou and Kravaritou (2012), Αρχαίες πόλεις Θεσσαλίας &amp; περίοικων περιοχών, a well-illustrated volume, provides an up-to-date synopsis of the current state of knowledge on Thessalian poleis, including much new evidence that complements Decourt et al. (2004); Sdrolia (2012c), Οι τοιχογραφίες του καθολικού της Μονής Πέτρας (1625) και η ζωγραφική των ναών των Αγράφων του Που αιώνα; Bosnakis (2013), ΕΝΘΕΤΤΑΛΙΖΕΣΘΑΙ: Τεχνοτροπία και ιδεολογία των θεσσαλικών επιτύμβιων ανάγλυφων του 5ου και του 4ου αι. π.Χ.; Sythiakaki Kritsimalli (2012), Ο ανάγλυφος αρχιτεκτονικός διάκοσμος στη Θεσσαλία και τη Φθιώτιδα. Παλαιοχρι στιανικά και πρώιμα μεσαιωνικά χρόνια. Exhibitions Two photographic exhibitions on archaeological finds from Thessalian sites were organized in the summer of 2013. To Κάστρο της Καλλιθέας - Ματιές σε μια αρχαία πόλη was held at the Cultural Centre of Pharsala and co-ordinated by Margriet Haagsma (Canadian Institute in Greece/Alberta) and Sophia Karapanou (15th EPCA), directors of the Kallithea project. For press reports, see Eleutheria on 15 June 2013 (http://www.eleftheria.gr/index.asp7catM-5 &amp;aid=54504#.UfygWxZTEfN and 5 July 2013: http:// www.eleftheria.gr/index.asp?cat=45&amp;aid=54909#.Ufy6n BZTEfN). A photographic exhibition focusing on the archaeological discoveries of the region around modem Chorto in southern Pelion, co-ordinated by Kostas Vouzaxakis (13th EPCA) and organized by the G. Angelinis - P. Chatzinikou Foundation, ran at the Folklore Museum of Chorto between 2-18 August 2013. See the press report in Tachydromos of 31 July 2013: http://www.taxydromos.gr/ article.php?id=84860&amp;cat= 1) Conferences In 2012 and early 2013 several conferences concerning the region were organized. First was the sixth HYPEREIA conference, Pherae- Velestino-Rigas, Archaeology, History, Folklore, held at Velestino, between 4-7 October 2012, with papers devoted to the region of Velestino (ancient Pherae) from antiquity to the War of Independence (http://www.karaberopoulos.gr/karaberopoulos/pdf/Synedr io2012.pdf). Relevant to the periods that interest us were the communications by Dimitris Agnousiotis on the recent Middle Bronze Age finds from sites near Lake Karla; by Kalliopi Almatzi on funerary practices in the region, during the Middle Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age; by Polyxeni Arachoviti on the very interesting results of salvage archaeology at Velestino, prompted by public works on the sewage system of the modem town (some were discussed in last year's report), such as the high quality relief depicting the Dioskouri (see below); by Yannis Pikoulas on the ancient route linking Pherae and Skotousa; by Argyro Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou on the relations of Pherae with outside communities; by Despina Efstathiou on the Hellenistic houses of Pherae, some of which, in the southern part of the city, provide interesting evidence for workshop activities (the Apostolinas and Tsoubekou plots), while other houses hint at the luxurious lifestyle of their occupants (for example the house on the Theodoropoulos plot, which had a peristyle courtyard, and an interesting domestic shrine); by Evangelia Stamelou on the metal finds from various contexts in the city; and by Vana Orfanou on the archeo-metallurgical analysis of the bronzes from the Sanctuary of Zeus Thaulios; by Maria Stamatopoulou on the Pilaf Tepe tumulus, proposing an earlier date for the burial, in the first half of the third century BC; and by Babis Intzesiloglou on the recently identified relief-ware pottery workshop at Demetrias, whose products reached Pherae.

Its aim was to remains, a number of papers in AEThSE 3 are devoted to present an overview of recent discoveries pertaining to the presentation of new evidence or the synthetic analysis cults and sanctuaries in the region in the first millennium of old discoveries in the light of current archaeological BC, in order to prompt discussion about cult activity in knowledge. Among the latter, Areti Pentedeka (2012) Thessaly and comparisons with neighbouring regions. Both discusses pottery exchange. Based on the pétrographie old finds, reassessed in light of archival work, and very analysis of sherds from 12 stratified excavation assem new discoveries were presented, mainly from the teams blages and informed by recent theoretical debates, she that are actively involved in fieldwork in the region. Some concludes that wide exchange networks as well as ware of the sites/finds considered have been presented in specific ones operated in the region. She points out the previous reports, such as the Sanctuary of Herakles at centrality of key sites such as Platia Magoula Zarkou Spartia/Latomion; the work on the Sanctuary of Zeus and Chalki 1, both situated at privileged geographical Thaulios at Pherae; the Sanctuary of Apollo at Soros; and locations: near a river, on passes and with access to water, the recent finds at Tempe (ID1357, ID1981, ID2328). Very Kalliopi Almatzi (2012) presents the results of important issues were raised regarding the criteria used to excavation at a site ca. 800m northeast of Magoula distinguish private or domestic from public cult (with Visviki, in the area of Velestino near the southwest shores regards to the Metroon at Demetrias), the 'domestic' cult at of Lake Karla.

The pottery [2012b]; and evidence for her cult in houses at Demetrias suggests that the site was occupied in the Early Neolithic, and in the sanctuary at Pharsala). There were also papers on Christos Batzelas (2012) analyses subterranean the ancestor/hero cult by the Mycenaean tholos tomb at habitation in Thessaly, using 'pit-houses' found at the Georgiko (Intzesiloglou [2002]), on poliad cults, on female northwest edge of the prehistoric tell Makrychori 1 as his worshippers in Thessaly and overviews of the archaeo- case study, in particular pit A in trench A31.

Leónidas Hatziaggelakis and Christos Karagianopoulos (2012) present the recent excavation at Magoula Agios Ioannis at Prodromos, otherwise known as Prodromos III (ID 1358). The magoula occupies an area of 8.5ha and is surrounded by the Voulgaris stream on the south and east. Sections of successive settlements were investigated and two major phases of occupation identified, dating from the Late Final Neolithic to the Final Neolithic, and from the early Early Bronze Age to the early Middle Bronze Age. The architectural remains of the Neolithic period suggest rectangular buildings with auxiliary structures and open spaces between them. In the southwest part of the trench, where remains of the Early to Middle Bronze Age have been identified, the long and narrow foundation trench of an apsidal building and postholes suggest that it was a house oriented north-south, 6.9m wide and at least 5.8m long. It recalls structures at Sitagroi. Various clay constructions, some ovens, have been investigated (Fig. 48). Besides the Neolithic remains, evidence for later activity includes a potter's kiln, most likely for the production of Roman to Late Roman tiles. Still in western Thessaly, the paper by Nina Kyparissi Apostolika et al. (2012) summarizes the results of the 2006-2007 excavations of a Middle Neolithic (or earlier) site near the Botanical Gardens at Neochori, on the shores of modem Lake Plastira, at an altitude of 800m. The evidence suggests semi-permanent habitation (household activities, a few figurines) and seasonal exploitation of the pasturelands by Thessalian plain herders during the summer months (Fig. 49). The parallels to similar discov eries at Grevena and Argithea highlight the diachronic importance of the highland zones for herders and hunting. Middle Helladic Two articles discuss Middle Helladic finds. Dimitris Agnousiotis and Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani (2012) present the preliminary results of the rescue excavations at Tsiggenina, 3km east of the village of Kanalia, near the shores of Lake Karla (ID1990), where seven struc tures belonging to a Middle Bronze Age to Early Helladic I settlement were investigated. All the houses were oriented east-west and were rectangular (megaroid in plan), with well-built stone walls and mud-brick superstructures. A different model was noted at complex Z-0, the largest at the site, where two initially independent buildings, an apsidal and a rectangular one, were combined in a later phase (Fig. 50). Since the settlement lies on flat land (unlike settlements at sites such as Argissa and Pefkakia) the buildings were quite widely spaced, probably in clusters with open areas between, sharing the same orientation. Kassandra Sismani (2012) offers a synopsis of funerary practices in Middle Bronze Age Thessaly. She proposes that towards the late Middle Bronze Age there was more pronounced differentiation in burials, a phenomenon that she attributes to the emergence of competing groups which used burials as a means of forging their social identities within their communities. &lt; '· Kgm i^Er HU 5 -— ·· -··:*'■ J* 48.

Mycenaean Thessaly In recent years there has been considerable emphasis on Mycenaean research in Thessaly. Discoveries from the area of Volos, the extensive cemetery finds from Aerino and Velestino, the sites and tomb remains near the former Lake Karla (ID 2157, ID1039), the extensive building remains at Makrychori near Agia and, further west, the monumental tombs at Georgiko and Dranista (Galanakis and Stamatopoulou [2012]), and other finds in the Karditsa region and even further north, have challenged the interpretation of Thessaly as a backwater of Mycenaean civilization. Many now consider it not so much peripheral, but as the northernmost border of Mycenaean culture. Pride of place in any analysis of Mycenaean Thessaly is naturally taken by the three major, contemporary, sites near Volos: Kastro/Palaia Volou, Pefkakia and Dimini. The relationship between these settlements, their hierarchy and their role in the Mycenaean world are not yet fully appreciated. It is thus very helpful that the long-standing excavator of Dimini, Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani (2012) offers in AEThSE 3 a detailed, up-to-date, overview of the site and her interpre tation of these three sites. She interprets Dimini, Kastro/Palaia Volou and Pefkakia as members of a single polity, namely the famous palatial centre of Iolkos, which controlled the harbour of the Pagasitic Gulf - the only easy outlet for the products of the Thessalian plains. At Dimini, habitation started in the 15th century when a prosperous Middle Helladic III settlement developed into an organized Mycenaean urban centre during Late Helladic IIIA2 (ID1066, ID1989, ID1043). Already in LHIIB there is evidence for an elite class, distinguished by the use of built tombs with a square chamber and dromos, and in LHIIIA and IIIB by the use of monumental tholos tombs. LHIIIA2 was a period of prosperity for the settlement, which is situated on the road that connects the Pagasitic Gulf with inland Thessaly and on a hill that offers an uninterupted view to the Bay of Volos. Already in LHIIIA2, and certainly in LHIIIB (when it peaked), the settlement extended over a large area (see ADelt 56-59 [2000-2004] B2, 473; AR 58 [2011-2012] 77) and was organized according to a coherent urban plan, i.e. there were central major avenues with houses on either side and a large architectural complex, covering an area of 4,000m2 (Fig. 51). The latter consists of a central gateway at the junction of two major avenues and Megara A and B, built with strong foundations, specific cult areas, a central sewage system, metal workshops in Megaron A (slag, lead vessels and moulds), other workshop areas (also for precious materials) and auxiliary areas for the preparation of food. Megaron B preserved evidence of specialized storage areas, areas designated for cult, the use of sealings and seals, and acquaintance with Linear B (albeit not in the form of tablets, as at nearby Kastro/Palaia). Entry to the complex was controlled through an impressive propylon at the end of the central road traversing the settlement north-south. The finds show contacts with the eastern Mediterranean as well as with the major centres of southern Greece and Crete. According to the excavator, the size, architectural form and finds of this complex imply that it served as the seat of the local political, economic and religious authority of the large settlement at Dimini and was occupied by the anaktes (leaders), who were eventually interred in the two adjacent large tholos tombs. Despite numerous local peculiarities (absence of a hearth with four columns or impressive frescoes), she sees close affinities to the architectural complexes of Mycenaean palaces in, for example, the sequence of courtyards, the central megaron surrounded by subsidiary buildings or workshops and cooking activities, as well as the adjacent megaron with evidence of cult activities and storage facil ities, and auxiliary buildings, as at Ano Englianos in Pylos. Contrary to the major Mycenaean acropoleis, Dimini was not fortified. According to Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani, the absence of fortifications characterizes eastern Thessalian settlements (Kastro/Palaia, Pefkakia, Velestino/Pherae, Boibe); therefore, we should look for a different habitation model than that in the south. Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani points out that a similar development to that at Dimini is demonstrated in the neighbouring sites at Kastro/Palaia Volou and Pefkakia, although, in both cases, settlement evidence is more limited (although ongoing excavations and research at both sites may change this picture). All three sites developed from prosperous Middle Helladic III settlements. They were near one another, around the mouth of the Pagasitic Gulf. At Kastro/Palaia there was also a megaron with administrative functions (AR 57 [2010-2011] 77-78), a nearby organized cemetery at Nea Ionia and monumental tholos tombs at Kapakli. Further afield is the major tholos tomb at Kazanaki (ID 1102). At Pefkakia recent excavations have revealed an important harbour settlement and impressive building remains (see below). The absence of fortifications at these sites is viewed as a sign of peaceful co-existence and collaboration, and thus Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani concludes that all three sites together formed the major centre of Mycenaean Iolkos.</page><page sequence="40">40 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU 51.

Immediately following the local) and quite a significant number of LHIIIA2 vases, destruction, two new pottery categories appeared - such as the glazed kylix. The same level contained vessels handmade burnished ware and pseudo-Minyan - which thought until now to belong to the transitional phase of are absent from the destruction layer. Earlier pottery styles LHIIIB2/IIIC Early or to LHIIIC Early. These are Type 1 continue to some extent, often simplified.

It is thus evident that the settlement FS128, FS106, with an everted rim profile, which are was far more inward-looking than before the destruction, considered as typical of LHIIIC Early but are also found in Vassiliki Adrymi-Sismani stresses that Dimini offers us a the LHIIIB2 destruction layer in Thebes (Pelopidos unique chance to understand the period after the Street), at Midea, at Mycenae and in a similar layer on the destruction of the palatial centres in Thessaly.

The finds reveal the prosperity of the harbour site in LHIIIA2-IIIB (contemporary with Thessaly from the Early Iron Age to Late Antiquity Dimini).

Since then, numerous articles have appeared, undoubtedly allow a far better understanding of the presenting the sanctuary and various finds (Mazarakis Mycenaean settlements at the mouth of the Pagasitic Gulf.

As the site is Further inland from the shores of the Pagasitic Gulf, at very well known, I will single out a few features that modern Velestino, evidence pertaining to the Mycenaean appear in contributions to AEThSE 3 that add to our period consists mainly of tombs, as the continuous understanding of the character of the cult, the development diachronic habitation of the site makes the discovery of of the shrine and its role in the religious landscape of impressive architectural remains difficult.

He draws comparisons with the recently excavated niches at Chani tis Kokkonas near Tempe (ID2328; Sdrolia [2012a]; Toufexis et al. [2012b]; AR 58 [2011-2012] 86-88) and interprets them either as areas for the deposition of votives or for food used in rituals. Given that in 2006 a phiale and an Archaic terracotta figurine of a seated woman were found nearby, these receptacles are linked to an initial, earlier, phase of the sanctuary. A monumental wall (T16) found outside and parallel to the entrance of the temple, measuring more than 30m long and 2.5-3m wide, has been tentatively interpreted as part of the fortification wall of the city. Northwest of the temple, a small oikos, building E, seems to have preceded the construction of the temple, as among the pottery fragments a few were possibly Early Archaic in date. Alexander Mazarakis Ainian and Iphigenia Leventi have interpreted this structure (at the Athens conference on cults in Thessaly) as an earlier temple on the site, later used as a treasury. The papers by Iphigenia Leventi (2012b) and Giorgos Vitos and Maria Panagou (2012) discuss finds from area Delta that corroborate the kourotrophic character of the cult on site and hint at the performance of maturation rites. The latter paper deals with about 270 small finds, the great majority of them metal. As the authors note, the group is characteristic of votive offerings dedicated in Late Archaic to Classical sanctuaries, but the large number of rings is noteworthy. They are interpreted as a form of currency. Among the finger rings are examples with engraved decoration, such as the image of Thetis or a winged young man and a padded dancer (Fig. 53). But what attracts attention (and mentioned by Leventi [2012b]) are the lead miniature votives (Fig. 54), I BE Η1415 BE 41375 I 53. Soros, Sanctuary of Apollo: engraved finger rings. © University ofThessaly (courtesy of A. Mazarakis Ainian). Jr®»0 BE 47797 BE 47809 BE 47824 BE 47755 54. Soros, Sanctuary of Apollo: metal votives. © University of Thessaly (courtesy of A. Mazarakis Ainian). especially the lead figure of a male, perhaps a padded dancer similar to those from Lakonian sanctuaries, a chair and an offering tray. Iphigenia Leventi's examination of the terracotta figurines from the sanctuary at Soros, is - as she herself notes - a welcome addition to the still limited number of publications on the coroplastic art of Thessaly. The material ranges from Late Archaic to Early Hellenistic and betrays the dependence of local coroplasts on the major production centres identified in the Aegean Greek world - the east Aegean in the Late Archaic period, and Boeotia and Athens in the Classical and Early Hellenistic. Female figurines predominate, among them a dancer holding a drum, figurines of Aphrodite and her circle, a hydriaphoros and images of boys with the kausia or wreath. Thus in the light of the sculptural dedications in the sanctuary (Leventi [2009]) and the lead image discussed above, Iphigenia Leventi suggests that maturation rites might have taken place at Soros. In terms of the Hellenistic coroplastic art of Demetrias, the newly published figurines from Soros demonstrate close similar ities to finds from the city, for example from the Pasikrata sanctuary. Elisavet Nikolaou (2012) focuses on the figurines discovered in the northern cemetery of Demetrias, excavated between 1995-1996 (Fig. 55). This is a very interesting group of vital importance for establishing the date and stylistic sequence of terracotta production in Demetrias because most of the figurines were found in undisturbed graves together with pottery, coins and lamps that help provide an approximate date for them. Female standing figurines predominate; boys wearing the chlamys 55. Demetrias, northern cemetery: figurines. © Archaeo logical Institute of Thessalian Studies (courtesy of E.

Nikolaou). and often a short-sleeved chiton and the characteristic kausia, are also common (and mostly found in children's tombs), as are Erotes and a few seated female figures. Similarly to Iphigenia Leventi, Elisavet Nikolaou considers these figurines as local products that adapt well known types established in the major coroplastic centres of the Greek world. She also notes dependence on Macedonian prototypes during the second century BC (for example on the images of Erotes leaning on pillars: Fig. 56). The articles by Nikolaou and Leventi update Karin Hornung-Bertemes' studies (1997; 2007). The recent rediscovery of large numbers of figurines originating from votive contexts excavated in the early 20th century (Pasikrata sanctuary, Sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods and the so-called Thesmophorion) and the publication of figurines from the cemeteries of Demetrias (Batziou Efstathiou and Triantaphylopoulou [2012]) and Soros provide us with a very rich corpus of terracottas from single cities and from various contexts (houses, sanctu aries and tombs). A collaborative, interdisciplinary, project aiming to record fully and analyse the coroplastic production of the city, its links to other major centres and its local peculiarities (morphological or iconographie) is finally possible.

As mentioned in last year's report (AR 58 [2011-2012] 76), extensive parts of the organized cemeteries of the ancient city at Mikrothives, which is identified with Phthiotic Thebes, have been excavated in the last decade (ID 1083; for a discussion of tombstones from the site, see Paveli [2012]). Stamatia Alexandrou (2012) discusses the lekythoi from the southern cemetery, in which 197 graves have been excavated. The cemetery was in use from the Classical period to Roman times. As she points out, all the lekythoi originate from merely six tombs. Extraordinary for the large number of vessels it contained is grave 8 on the Alektorides plot (Fig. 57), which contained the remains of a young man and 70 vases (among them 24 lekythoi) together with glass vessels, stone and terracotta alabastra, figurines and parts of wreaths. The majority of the lekythoi from the cemetery belongs to the so-called secondary type, with palmette decoration. The frequency of products of the workshops of the Haemon and Diosphos Painters is unsurprising as they were widely exported in the early fifth century BC. More unusual for Thessaly, and interesting with regards to the issue of the distribution of these items outside Attica, is the white-ground lekythos decorated with a scene of 'the visit to the tomb' and attributed by the author to the circle of the Saburoff Painter (Figs 58, 59).

The graves in respectively, were extensively presented in last year's the western cemetery of Pharsala were found in clusters, report (AR 58 [2011-2012] 79-82), as were the recent immediately north of the monumental Late Archaic tholos discoveries at Nea Anchialos/Christian Phthiotic Thebes tomb (the so-called Verdelis Tomb) and the well-known (Dina [2012]). Suffice to repeat here the vitality of Mycenaean tombs discovered in its vicinity; a tumulus material culture in Roman Imperial times when Demetrias served as the western edge of the cemetery.

The pottery shapes suggest continuity from the Mycenaean period and close links with the communities of the Pagasitic Gulf. Although influences from the north are apparent, contacts with the Thessalo-Euboean koine were more pronounced. The tombs were used from the Submycenaean to Sub-Protogeometric II. In Pharsala itself, Early Iron Age finds are known from the Agia Paraskevi hill, near the major springs of Apidanos, and also from the centre of the modern town, where Protogeometric pottery and a child grave have been noted. The author sees the tombs as belonging to a settlement that in the Archaic period developed into a leading polis of Phthiotis (in a pattern that is similarly attested in other major Thessalian cities: Velestino/Pherae and Larisa). The two tholos graves north of Pharsala raise the issue of the connection of isolated Iron Age tombs with a specific installation/settlement. About 2km south of the tombs is the Magoula Bambakous, near the Enipeus river, whose surface finds include Early Iron Age pottery sherds. The association of the tombs with this site is attractive but must remain tentative at present. The valley of Enipeus, rich in water, fertile land and pasturelands and near the road leading to the sea, saw dense habitation which can be observed diachronically. For the Early Iron Age, besides Pharsala, other key sites are Chtouri (Euydrion), Palaiokastro Ampelias and, further away, Kallithea Pharsalon (Peuma; tholos tombs) and Neo Monastiri (Proerna), the southernmost area where tholos tombs are found. The western cemetery of the Archaic to Hellenistic city was mainly investigated by Nikolaos Verdelis in the 1950s; recent identifications of the finds from the cemetery in the National Archaeological Museum have allowed a better understanding of the date of typically Thessalian architectural forms, such as built chamber tombs with pyramidal roofs, and an appreciation of the complexity and variability of the necropolis. A recent article on the Classical grave periboloi of Pharsalos notes the presence of Attic-style grave enclosures in the city as early as the late fifth century (Stamatopoulou and Katakouta [2013]); albeit smaller in dimensions and less elaborate in ornamentations, the existence of periboloi in Pharsalos is interesting (see also ID1077). Staying in Pharsala, Sophia Karapanou's paper in AEThSE 3 (2012) offers the most up-to-date study of Hellenistic Pharsalos, whose material culture is far better understood following the intensive archaeological inves tigation of the last 20 years (ID1023, ID1076, ID1078; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B2, 543 47, 551-56). From this important article, we should note the discovery of the course of the fortification wall in the northern part of the city, about 8m further north than assumed, making the estimated area of the walled city 1 lOha (Fig. 65). Among the 48 plots excavated in the modern town, parts of roads were identified in 12, five following a north-south orien tation and seven an east-west orientation. Most were pebbled, but there was also a paved street on the Kyriazopoulos plot (AR 58 [2011-2012] 76-77, fig. 124). Although it is not yet possible to reconstruct the urban plan of the city or the dimensions/shape of insulae, due to the constraints of rescue excavations, it is clear that each insula contained at least two private houses accessed via small alleys. The realization of the urban plan required extensive terracing (attested on the Loukoutou brothers' plot and the Belkris plot). On the hill of Agia Paraskevi is one of the major springs of the Apidanos river. W.M. Leake had reported water-pipes and cisterns on the hill, still preserved for visitors to see in the early 19th century. In recent excavations, an important subterranean water-supply system located in numerous parts of the city (for example at Canada and Athinas Streets) consists of built tunnels, cisterns, etc. that reveal significant investment by the city. Much evidence survives for Hellenistic houses; although no house plan has yet been fully investigated, enough is known to appreciate their layout and organization during this period. Most houses had provision for drainage (open or built pipes under the floors of rooms) and water supply (wells in the courtyards, clay pipes); with their large dimensions, mosaic floors and andrones, a few houses reveal a more luxurious lifestyle (for example that on the Arsenopoulos brothers' plot). Figurine assem blages, special constructions and small deposits with objects of a votive character provide information about cult practice in the houses. Evidence for public buildings suggests that the centre of the Hellenistic city coincides with that of the modern town (at Demarcheion Square). The stoa on the property of S. Lydakis (excavated in the 1980s by Athanasios Tziafalias of the 15th EPCA) can be associated with the inscription on a lintel found by Nikolaos Giannopoulos in a pit containing also architec tural members on the adjacent property of M. Galanis (Giannopoulos [1934-1935]); the inscription mentions the foundation of a stoa by Leónides son of Proteas from Halikarnassos, for the training of youths and the foundation of contests, and named after him (Zaphiropoulou [2004] 112-13). More evidence for stoas has been unearthed near the modern Demarcheion Square. Outside the northwestern fortifications, architec tural remains of Hellenistic date, unearthed on the property of the fourth primary school and at S. Karakosta Street, have been tentatively interpreted as belonging to a public building, perhaps a gymnasion or a sanctuary, because of their size, location and construction. 65.

Karapanou).</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 47 The sanctuaries and cults of the city are known predom inantly through inscriptions and earlier investigations on the Agia Paraskevi hill, where a Sanctuary of Zeus Thaulios was located, and on the Agios Nikolaos hill to the east of the city, where the Sanctuary of Asklepios was located. Pits containing votive objects and parts of a Hellenistic building, excavated on the northern slopes of the acropolis on Prophitis Elias hill, belonged to a Sanctuary of Demeter that was in use from the late sixth century into the Hellenistic period (localities of Platoma and Eikonismataki). The cults of Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Thetis, the Nymphs and Hestia are attested epigraphically, while the cult of Athena, symbolized on the obverse of the city's coins, is further implied by the discovery of a fragmentary statue of the goddess. Architectural members made of sandstone imply the existence of at least one Archaic Doric temple near the centre of the ancient city, either in the area of the Municipality building or at the comer of 25 Martiou and Athinas Streets, where a large retaining wall and boundary stones were found on the Loukoutou brothers' plot (Fig. 66). It has often been pointed out, and was repeatedly stressed during the conference on Thessalian cults in Athens in 2012, that there are serious issues regarding the secure identification of domestic cult (are clusters of figurines or of small incense burners adequate criteria?) and the distinction between private/household cult and public cult activity, performed by larger groups, thiasoi or the polis. With regards to Pharsalos, at the Athens conference Stella Katakouta presented the finds from the property of D. Kyritsis, where, despite the fragmentary nature of the architectural remains and the limited area investigated, a very interesting third- to second-century BC assemblage was discovered. Among the finds were numerous drinking vessels, a few complex kernoi and thymiateria, numerous terracotta figurines, mostly depicting female figures, and at least 15 female busts, with clear distinctions in age, as well as four small relief plaques depicting the Mother of the Gods/Cybele (Katakouta [forthcoming]). Stella Katakouta attributes the finds to a sanctuary located very near the eastern walls of the city. The architectural remains, with the large roofed area next to an oikos-type room, the numerous kantharoi, plates, bowls and skyphoi, the kernoi and the plaques lead her to propose that this was a sanctuary where cult was addressed to female deities, predominantly the Mother of the Gods and possibly other divinities. Finally, the articles in AEThSE 3 by Palioungas (2012) and Karatasios et al. (2012), on a faience hemispherical bowl with relief and painted decoration in the Karamanolis collection, found in Pharsala and dated on stylistic criteria to the late third to the first half of the second century BC, give us a glimpse into the luxury items possessed by the inhabitants of Pharsalos and hint at contacts with Ptolemaic Egypt (ID1024). At Kallithea Pharsalon (ancient Peuma), the collabo rative research project led by Margriet Haagsma (Canadian Institute in Greece/Alberta) and S. Karapanou (15th EPCA) in the small city continues (ID248). Their communication at the conference on Thessalian cults in Athens focused on Buildings 5 and 10. In the public space on the saddle of the hill identified as the agora, a small temple, Building 5 (ID248, ID458) (Fig. 67), consisted of an anteroom in the east, with a tile paved floor in the southern part (as in the court in front of the temple), and a western room with a threshold formed I &gt;f:} i " ι 66.

Study of the assemblage will add significantly to our understanding of funerary practices in the region during the first half of the first millennium BC. Despite the very important early discoveries at ancient Gonnoi, whose remains are situated near the homonymous modern village - namely the acropolis sanctuary dedicated to Athena Polias, the Sanctuary of Artemis near the southwest gate and the Asklepieion, outside the city (the latter investigated by Athanasios Tziafalias), and the very large number of tombstones and inscriptions known from the city (many published in Helly's pioneering [1973] monograph) - there has not been much systematic work undertaken at the ancient site since the 1920s. In the last few years, either because of torrential rain or due to illegal activities in the region (ID1965), numerous graves have been discovered in the outskirts of modem Gonnoi (see the press report in Eleutheria of 4 June 2013: http://www.eleftheria.gr /index.asp?cat =43&amp;aid=53491 #.Ufy-mhZTEfN). Road and defence systems in Thessaly: historical geography Yannis Pikoulas' research projects - Crossing the Pindus: Passages and Defense and the subsequent Crossing Olympus: Passages and Defense (still underway) - have added significantly to our grasp of the border regions between Thessaly and, respectively, Epims (Hestiaiotis) and Macedonia (Perrhaibia). Pikoulas has recorded the surface archaeological remains of numerous sites with precision and in detail, and thus offers much useful infor mation about these regions (ID247, ID2030). During inspection of the Sarantaporos-Porta route, the important pass from Thessaly to Macedonia, it was possible to identify parts of the ancient road and, more importantly, ancient wheel-ruts at two sites near the hill of Vigla Sarantaporou in Perrhaibia; these were recorded and the entire pass was mapped digitally (Figs 70, 71). The ancient road followed the same route as the Ottoman road and the old Eparchiake odos, whereas the modem road is located much further to the west. Pikoulas also notes an important site (with plentiful Hellenistic and Roman pottery sherds on the surface and architectural remains) (Pikoulas [2009a]; [2012b]) at Phanos near the village of Phlabouro/Mitsiouni, on the left/east bank of the river Elassonitikos, at a location which controls the entrance to the Diava pass. With regards to ancient Hestiaiotis, Yannis Pikoulas considers as definite the identifications of modem Kalabaka with ancient Aiginion and Skoumbos Peristeras with ancient Phaloreia. He also accepts the identification of the remains at Kastri Loutrou (acropolis and lower town, traces of fortification wall, two burial grounds, pottery of the fourth to first century BC) with ancient Mondaia (Pikoulas [2009b]; [2012a]). Based on the topographical features of the site, Strabo's description of the sequence of settlements in the region (7.7.9/327) and on-site inspection of the area, Y. Pikoulas proposes to identify ancient Oxyneia, at the northern border of Hestiaiotis, with Paliokastro Xirokampou, south of modern Oxyneia/ Meritsa (Pikoulas [2012a]). Although the remains are not impressive on the surface, he thinks that the site, which offers a good view to modem Kalabaka/Aiginion (to its south), is the best candidate for Oxyneia: sited on a hill by the west bank of the river Mourganis (ancient Ion), it commands a fertile valley and sits in a strategic location, on the Agiophylo/Velemisti pass (to modem Grevena). ■ s§ i ■ WmBKgSmM 70.

Other major sites in this region are located at 0(u)glas Asprokklisias, about 1.5km west of Asprokklisia, and Paliokklisi-Vergina, east of Stagiades. Epigraphic evidence A number of very important epigraphic documents were presented at both the conference on Thessalian cults at the BSA in Athens and AEThSE 3. As their full discussion will appear in Bulletin Epigraphique and SEG, I will mention here, briefly, just the most important ones. Jean-Claude Decourt and Athanasios Tziafalias (2012) discuss a very important new inscription concerning religious matters (unfortunately the full text is not given). The text was carved on a high marble opisthographic stele, 1.45m high, found in 2002 at Marmariani in secondary</page><page sequence="50">50 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU use (Larisa Museum 2002/33). Fifty four lines are readable on Face A and 82 on Face B. The stele is very carefully inscribed and has been dated on letter forms to the middle of the second century BC. This very long text (for Thessaly) preserves part of a lex sacra and a sacrificial calendar, and also offers information that allows us to visualize the layout and various architectural features of the sanctuary (períbolos, propylon and prothyron, as well as a fountain, altars, etc.), the cult personnel and the performance of a, most likely, mystery, cult. According to the editors, the main divinity was Artemis Phylake, attested with this epithet here only (whereas Demeter Phylake is well known from Thessaly). Artemis was worshipped alongside numerous other divinities, among them Mên. We should single out (as the authors do) Mogga (line A6), Alaia, Lillaia (A15, A16), and Adara and Lilla (B80) since they hint at the oriental character of aspects of the cult. Tzafalias and Gerard Lucas (2012) present the inscription on a stele that was found reused in a church at the entrance to the modem village of Dolichi (Elasson Collection El49). The left part of the stele preserves an inscription in 54 lines (the right half is missing), which the editors date on letter forms to the end of the second century BC. The first 32 lines concern the organization of the surveillance of the territory of ancient Doliche (which they have identified with the remains at modem Sarantaporo/Glikovo), but also perhaps more widely of the Perrhaibian Tripolis, as they assume on the basis of the content of the following 46 lines. The first part of the inscription refers to the financial and administrative proce dures of the organization of this surveillance, mentioning the local officials, (agoi and tamiai. The second part, from line 33 onwards, records that surveillance is given to a certain Menon, whose name appears numerous times in the inscription. The delimitation of the geographical area mentioned in the text coincides with that of the territories of the cities of Tripolis, as suggested by the numerous toponyms known from other inscriptions from the region. On the acropolis of the Early Christian town at Kastri Livadiou (ID1055-1057), excavations of the eastern part of the fortification wall and of basilica Gamma, conducted by Lazaros Deriziotis and Spyros Kougioumtzoglou (7th EBA), have revealed evidence for earlier, Roman, architecture on the site (Deriziotis and Kougioumtzoglou [2012]. On the walls of the basilica and in the immediately vicinity many inscribed monuments were identified, some bearing the name of ancient Doliche. Numerous architectural members (orthostat blocks), bases of votive stelae and statues, and small altars were used as building material for the basilica. A large number bear manumission inscriptions dated between 80-50 BC and AD 28. The excavators comment on two groups of inscriptions. The first attest to the existence of a Sanctuary of Herakles Kynagidas in the area (Fig. 72), possibly as early as the late fourth century BC. These texts mention a priest (Admetos, son of Amyntas) and two neokoroi of the Temple of Herakles (Antigenes, son of Aristeros, and Seleukos, son of Epigenes) (Fig. 73). Among the earliest monuments is the votive stele to Herakles Kynagidas dedicated by Alexandras, son of Eudemos, which has been dated on letter forms to the late fourth century BC (Figs 74, 75). The importance of the cult of Herakles Kynagidas in the Macedonian kingdom and in areas under Macedonian control is well established epigraphically. Several inscriptions confirm the existence of a major sanctuary of the god at Veroia (Hatzopoulos [2006] 54) and a recently published letter of Antipater refers to the edict of Philip V (184 BC), found in the theatre of Demetrias, concerning the dress of the Hunters of Herakles Kynagidas (Intzesiloglou [2006]). Another very important document reused in the basilica (inv. A92 and A99) records a letter of the Roman general Aemilius Paulus - described as consul of the Romans in the prescript - to the tagoi - the local officials of the polis of Doliche in Perrhaibia (ca. 168 BC). Aemilius Paulus asks the tagoi to investigate claims to land and resolve territorial disputes. Bearing in mind the proposed date of the document of 168 BC, it would appear that these disputes arose among the locals following, most likely, an earlier distribution of the formerly Macedonian land to its previous owners by Titus Quintius Flamininus soon after 197 BC (cf. the letters of Flamininus to the cities of Chyretiai (IG IX.2.338) and Metropolis (SEG IIIVII.495). The letter illustrates some of the ways in which the Romans became active in local Thessalian affairs and reminds us of the roughly contemporary senatus consultum from Demetrias (AR 58 [2010-2011] 81; Batziou-Efstathiou and Pikoulas [2006]). 72.

In conclusion, the new epigraphic evidence from Kastri Livadiou serves as a good reminder that Perrhaibia, as well as exhibiting strong cultural and linguistic affinities with Macedonia, was officially integrated into the Macedonian kingdom from the mid fourth century to 197 BC. For a detailed presentations of the finds from Kastri Livadiou with illustrations of most, see the presen tation of Spyros Kougioumtzoglou at the First Festival of Perraibike Tripolis, 30 August 2008 (http://dolihinews. files, wordpress.com/2010/03/festival_l .pdf). Northern Sporades Argyro Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou et al. (2012) present the results of recent work in the Sanctuary of Asklepios in Skopelos town, ancient Peparethos, discovered in the 1960s (ID1051). Its identification is confirmed epigraphi cally and it seems that the cult of Asklepios at the site began in the fifth century BC (which would make it one of the earliest Asklepieia). Excavations have been small scale; the northern part of the sanctuary is under the modern coastal road and part of the site has been destroyed by the sea. The principal building of the sanctuary was a stoa with three or perhaps four wings (Fig. 76). The estimated area of this complex (including the enclosed courtyard) was 2,500m2. Most of the southern wing of the stoa has been investigated; it is 38m long by 12m wide and three large areas/rooms have been explored so far. The western wing of the stoa, partially investigated, seems to have been a roofed open area, without internal divisions, facing the courtyard. Along the northern wall of the southern stoa, bases for votives have been found in situ. The thick destruction layer observed in the rooms and the pteron of the stoa contained Lakonian-type roof tiles, many bearing stamps with the name of the god in the genitive (Fig. 77); two tiles bear the stamps hieros and demosios respectively. Architectural remains and evidence for an earlier phase of use of this site were revealed underneath the floor of the courtyard. Notable among them is a rectangular -Λ * ί Γ" η h *έο.*. I Γ γ · 76.

Its well formed sides were covered with off-white plaster and are preserved to a maximum height of 0.5m. Very near all four corners of this structure were found five necks of Peparethian I type amphorae, placed upright. A few remains of burnt bones imply that the structure may have served as an eschara or altar for sacrifices (Fig. 78). At present, systematic investigation of this earlier phase of the sanctuary is hindered by its location at the northern edge of the plot, under the road. Among the large number of finds from the site, pottery (mostly fragmentary and of fourth-century date) predominates. The excavators stress the high-quality Athenian red-figure pottery, especially bell kraters. Otherwise, sympotic vessels, amphorae and lamps, both plain and black-glazed, are common. Loomweights are also plentiful, both conical and pyramidal, some stamped. 78. Skopelos/Peparethos, Asklepieion: eschara. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 13th EPCA (courtesy of A. Doulgeri Intzesiloglou). Stone sculpture is well-represented at the site and includes predominantly marble statues of young children, as befits a sanctuary of Asklepios; but terracotta figurines are rare. The few found so far mostly represent female figures and date to the early fifth century, predating the cult of Asklepios at the site and implying that, before him, a female deity (Artemis has been tentatively suggested) was most likely worshipped here. Finally, the 60 coins discovered on site, dating from the early fifth to the late third century BC, provide additional evidence for the period of use of the site and complement the date given by the stamped roof tiles (some as late as the Hellenistic period). As expected, most of the coins are of Peparethos, but coins of Skiathos, Thasos and the Euboean cities are also common (all these cities were, like Peparethos, members of the Athenian League). Also on Skopelos, a new site was identified near Panormos, about 1km from the ancient city at Agios Georgios. The old excavations had revealed a workshop for the production of amphorae (with a refuse pit). Rescue excavation in the lower town has revealed parts of the Classical buildings. On the new site, many pot sherds, mostly of fourth-century date, and frgaments of amphorae and other vessels, were scattered on the surface. According to Argyro Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou the new finds may be associated with viticulture and the production of wine. The excavations, which began in April 2013, aim to clarify the character of the site (see the report in Tachydromos of 3 July 2013: http://www.taxydromos.gr/article.php?id= 8295 l&amp;cat=88#.UdSTlRZTEfM). Kalliopi Preka-Alexandri (2012) presents the shipwreck found at Skantzoura; its cargo consisted of two concentrations of amphorae lying at a depth of 37-40m. The most common amphora types were those of Thasos, Mende and Solocha I (Peparethian); as with the Peristera shipwreck, good-quality Attic tableware was also found (skyphoi and kantharoid cups). The shipwreck - the second found at Skantzoura - constitutes yet another corroboration of the importance of this sea route for trade with the northern Aegean and the Black Sea. Conclusions As has become clear from the reports of the last few years, salvage archaeology has produced extraordinarily rich results in Thessaly. Thanks to new publications, these are becoming more widely known and allow for connections to be drawn between regions, settlements, materials and artefact styles. Despite its fragmentary nature, urban archaeology in those modern towns that coincide with ancient cities has produced sufficient infor mation to provide us with a more synthetic presentation/analysis of their layout and development. Thus Pharsalos, Pherae, Demetrias and also Larisa (for the Hellenistic and later phases of habitation) and Nea Anchialos/Phthiotic Thebes are all excavated to an extent that allows us to understand their infrastructure, layout and private dwellings. Equally, there is now a far richer corpus of material available for study from numerous cities and from across the region as a whole. For the Archaic to Roman period, it is now possible to study and understand local craft activity besides that of sculptural production (Leventi [2012a]; Bosnakis [2013]). To give but a few examples, consider workshop installations in houses (Pherae, Demetrias and Pharsala), the terracotta and Hellenistic pottery production</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 53 in Demetrias, Pherae and Pharsalos, metal workshops and the Imperial period mosaic floors from throughout the region. Equally, the defence system of specific regions, sanctuaries and cults and domestic architecture (Kallithea, Pharsalos, Pherae and Demetrias) are now ripe for further study, as is the study of Roman Imperial or Late Antique Thessaly. Synthetic collaborative projects reported in AEThSE 3 or at recent conferences are indicative of the vitality of work in the region: see, for example, the analysis of the metallurgical properties of finds from the Sanctuary of Zeus Thaulios, work on terracottas and metallurgy at Pherae (Asderaki-Tzoumerkioti and Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]), Kastro/Palaia and Dimini conducted by E. Asderaki-Tzoumerkioti (formerly head conservator, 13th EPCA) in collaboration with the 13th EPCA and the osteological analysis of skeletal remains from numerous cemeteries, for example Velestino and Demetrias. The importance of landscape as a determining factor in the development of settlements/regions has been stressed repeatedly in the publications of the past year; good case studies are the cities along the coast (Stylida/Phalara, Nea Anchialos/Phthiotic Thebes, Soros, Pefkakia and Demetrias to the west of Volos, and Kastro/Palaia) or in locations commanding sea routes like Kastro Velikas (Fig. 79). Equally, the finds at Neochori, near modem Lake Plastira, remind us of the importance of the highland pasturelands for animal husbandry and local economies from Neolithic times to the modem day. /i 79.

Inevitably, given the years covered, some of the activity summarized in this volume has already been noted in AG and brief notices of some appears in the decadal summary of the activities of all the prehistoric and Classical ephorias (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes; AR 58 [2011-2012] 58). Emphasis here is on those activities not already noted in AG or those where significant new information appears in the new volume of ADelt. The second meeting on Archaeological Work on Crete (AWiC2), alluded to last year {AR 58 [2011-2012] 58), has been published and can be read online through the University of Crete's Library (http://elocus.lib.uoc.gr/ dlib/d/0/5/metadata-dlib-1368695830-557833-31681 .tkl#). A third meeting is scheduled for December 2013 and will hopefully be made accessible with equally commendable promptness. The proceedings of the Tenth International Cretological Congress held in Chania in 2006 (see AR 53 [2006-2007] 96) are still to appear in print, although e offprints of individual contributions continue to circulate. New material in this year's entry is therefore drawn primarily from ADelt 56-59 (2001-2004) B5 and AWÍC2. Publications The past year has seen a number of significant publica tions on prehistoric Crete, including the proceedings of several conferences. The publication by the BSA of Intermezzo: Intermediacy and Regeneration in Middle Minoan III Palatial Crete (Macdonald and Knappett [2013]), containing papers presented at a workshop held in 2008, complements volumes noted last year (AR 58 [2011-2012] 58) on Late Minoan IB ceramics (Brogan and Hallager [2011]) and on the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods (Early Minoan to Middle Minoan II) (Schoep et al. [2011]). Although the focus on a single period (MMIII) might seem excessively narrow, it is a critical period, during which developments occurred that set the scene for what many regard as the heyday of Minoan Crete. Taken together, the three volumes facilitate a much improved understanding of socio-cultural develop ments on Crete from the later third to the mid second millennium BC, particularly in offering better correlations (especially Brogan and Hallager [2011]; Macdonald and Knappett [2013]) between archaeological sequences at sites excavated in different traditions and over many years. As a result, the potential to understand the emergence, development and (apparent) collapse of the first complex polities on the island is greatly enhanced. The absolute dating of the Thera/Santorini eruption (for example Warburton [2009]), however, a key to definitively calibrating the Minoan sequence to that in Egypt and the Near East (a topic treated in a recent Austrian PhD thesis: Hôflmayer [2012]), still eludes consensus. It is pleasing to note in the above volumes the substantial contribution of younger generations of Minoan archaeologists, particularly in relation to the study of older material as well as recent finds at Phaistos, Agia Triada and Malia, and also at newly-excavated sites such as Petras, Sisi and Gaidourophas (see below), to name a few. As a result of programmes of study and re-study, supported by regional investigation and crucially coupled with prompt publication, sites like Phaistos, Agía Triada and Malia are arguably better understood than Knossos, despite over a century of investigation there. Early-career scholars are also to the fore in another recent conference volume: Minoan Realities: Approaches to Images, Architecture, and Society in the Aegean Bronze Age (Panagiotopoulos and Günkel-Maschek [2013]) containing seven papers from a workshop which took place in November 2009 at the University of Heidelberg. Finally, it is partly due to the commitment of a younger colleague that a worthy companion to the Aegean collection in the Ashmolean Museum (covering all its aspects: its history, Cycladic, Minoan, Mycenaean, scripts and seals) has been published (Galanakis [2013]). At the opposite end of the career trajectory, several volumes have recently appeared honouring senior figures in the field of Minoan archaeology. Philistor (Mantzourani and Betancourt [2012]) honours Costis Davaras with 29 contributions spanning the Prepalatial to the end of Bronze Age and Κρήτης Μινωίδος (Carinci [2011]) contains 32 contributions plus several reminiscences of Vincenzo La Rosa. A less conventional volume, Θα 'θελα αυτή τη μνήμη να την πω (Sapouna-Sakellaraki and Deligianni-Kotsi [2012]), celebrates the life ofYiannis Sakellarakis (see /1/? 57 [2010-2011] 63) with a series of memoirs by 65 archaeologists and others who knew or worked with him. Φιλική Συναυλία (Graziadio et al. [2013]), a volume in honour of Mario Benzi, although not limited to Crete, contains a section with nine papers dedicated to the island's Neolithic and Bronze Age. Parallel Lives (Cadogan et al. [2012]) contains the proceedings of an original conference, held in Nicosia in 2006 to explore the parallel trajectories of the Mediterranean's two largest Greek-speaking islands (Cyprus and Crete). It contains a series of contributions, each pairing a Cypriot and a Cretan specialist, who compare developments on the two islands under several key themes. Not surprisingly, since the two islands lie over 500km apart and in different parts of the Mediterranean, the contrasts are perhaps more frequent than the similar ities, but the comparison is often thought-provoking. Also published in the last year was KOSMOS, proceedings of the 13th Aegean conference (Nosch and Laffineur [2012]), on the topic of jewellery, adornment and textiles; among its 800-plus pages are many papers on prehistoric Crete. The KOSMOS conference was remarkable at the time, because it happened during the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which disrupted travel for many and forced its quick-thinking organizers to deliver many papers by live streaming over the internet; potential disaster became a great success. Increasing familiarity with internet-based resources is characteristic of the 'younger generations' mentioned above, who are tending to communicate and share information through academia.edu (http://www.academia.edu/) and facebook. Space precludes an exhaustive list of such resources (cf. also AR 56 [2010-2011] 71-72), but here are a few 'highlights'. Early-career archaeologists in Greece have founded Aigeus/Αιγεύς (http://www.aegeussociety.org/ en/index.php/), a web-resource (with enhanced services for subscribers) collecting information about lectures, exhibitions, publications (books and articles, including reviews) and other newsworthy activities in the field of</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 57 β ■~f _ ''' MmsSmmbs1 Map 4.

It also publishes a monthly newsletter as a downloadable pdf. Nestor too, of course, has published its monthly newsletter and bibliography in the same format for some time now, while continuing to maintain a cumulative web-based searchable database (http://classics.uc.edu/nestor/index.php/nestorbib), a valuable research tool for our field. Although many journals and books have been available online for a long time, it is pleasing to note that pdf versions of The Institute for Aegean Prehistory's series are becoming available and Oxbow Books too is commencing publication in the same format. The Minoan Realities conference mentioned above was published simultaneously in physical and pdf format by the Presses universitaires de Louvain in their collection AEGIS: Archéologie du monde minoen, which is building a small library of publications, including the first three volumes of preliminary reports of the Sisi (ID2824) excavations. Apart from the possibility for prompt publication, for those of us looking at our groaning bookshelves, this must be the way forward. Eastern Crete Although perhaps never justifiably labelled the 'wild country east of Dikte', the 'feel' of the historical sequence and the landscape in eastern Crete (from the Mirabello Bay region to the eastern coast) is different from regions in the centre and west. Recent discoveries and publica tions, however, mean that the characterization 'wild country' is even less appropriate; indeed, it is arguable that published documentation of this part of Crete is as good, if not better, than for any other part of the island. In part this is due to a series of intensive archaeological surveys carried out in the region. The Mirabello Bay area has been covered more or less completely by the Vrokastro (Hayden [2005]), Kavousi (Haggis [2005]) and recently published Gournia (ID1783; Watrous et al. [2012]) surveys. This has allowed the key excavated sites of Priniatikos Pyrgos (ID2003), Vrokastro, Gournia (ID2860), Kavousi (most recently, Day and Glowacki [2012]) and Chrysokamino (Betancourt [2006]) to be interpreted in a broader, landscape context. The excavated sites of Pseira (ID191I; recent publication in Betancourt [2012]) and Mochlos (ID2816; both the island and the mainland opposite) bring us almost round to the important Neopalatial site of Papadiokambos (ID1792; A WiC'l 70-80) and the Siteia Bay region, surveyed in the 1980s (Tsipopoulou [1989]), where the early sites of Petras (also an administrative centre in later phases) and Agia Photia lie. Finds from the Final Neolithic and Early Minoan settlement and tombs (house and rock-shelter) at Kephala Petras (IDI793; AWiC2 60-69) (Fig. 80) resonate with material from the Agia Photia cemetery (most recently, Davaras and Betancourt [2012]); both show links to the Cyclades, in the case of Kephala going back perhaps into the Final Neolithic (Papadatos and Tomkins [2013]). Also reflecting cultural diversity in this region is the recent discovery of a Mesara-type tholos tomb at Skopi Mesorrachi (ID3577, ID2802; cf. AWiC2 49-50; AR 58 [2011-2012] 72), first constructed in the Early Minoan IA phase, that is about as early as any of the tombs in the Mesara itself (Fig. 81). It is paralleled on the opposite, south coast by a slightly later example at the site of Goudouras Livari Skiadi (ID3572, ID1785; cf. AWiC2 50-52; AR 58 [2011-2012] 72), in use from EMIB to III and showing links both to the Mesara and to another 'displaced' Mesara-type tholos at Krasi in the Pediada region. It is worth noting that the tomb at Livari was also a survey find by the Austrian team that has been investi gating the southeastern comer of Crete for several years now (for example Schlager et al. [2010]). The eastern coastal region of Crete, from the Sidero peninsula to Ambelos in the southeast has also experi enced archaeological survey. The Itanos survey (ID1784; http://prospection-itanos.efa.gr/; cf. AR 56 [2010-2011] 72) covered much of the Sidero peninsula, but did not extend to Siteia Bay in the west or the Palaikastro region in the east. An earlier survey of the Roussolakkos location at Palaikastro (MacGillivray et al. [1984]) has now been superseded by the first season of renewed investigations at the site (ID2901): these involved the creation of a high resolution geo-database of the 'greater Palaikastro' area, requiring ground-truthing and mapping of visible remains, as well as geophysical survey on the site itself. In addition to landscape features, such as terraces and check-dams, investigations in the wider region produced a new Linear A-inscribed offering table from the peak sanctuary of Petsopha. As I write, the first excavation season (of four) of has recently finished. The Minoan Roads Research Programme (ID1874) first revealed and explored in the 1980s a network of roads and structures ('guardposts'), some identified by Arthur Evans in 1896 (Brown [2001] 225-27), linking the Palaikastro area with that around Kato Zakros and extending to Xerokambos/Ambelos on the southeast coast (Tzedakis et ΤΝ-ΪΙΜΙ ΟΙΚΙΣΜΟΙ ΝΕΚΡΟΤΑΦΕΙΟ JPJI I ΒΡΛΧΟΣΚΕΠΙΙ 80.

The research programme continues (cf. AR 56 [2009-2010] 173 and earlier reports), conducting survey and excavation at various locations. Two 'forts' (phylakia) were excavated in the Karoumes Bay area between Palaikastro and Kato Zakro: the so-called 'fort of the sea' (Middle Minoan IIB to Late Minoan IB, with LMIIIA2 reuse) and the 'Mitriko fort' (LMI and LMIIIA2/B) (ID3573). Survey between the bay and Chochlakies village (ID3641) identified sites including a small Late Neolithic to Early Minoan settlement north of Chochlakies itself, a limestone quarry at Skoinias Bay and a cave site at the base of Mount Traostalos. South of Kato Zakros, survey and excavations continued in 2001-2004 at and around the site of Choiromandres (ID173; first identified by Arthur Evans in 1896, known as ' Siromandres ' : Brown [2001] 321-23). Excavation and subsequent study in 2001-2004 (ID3565 to ID3568) clarified the sequence at the 'guardpost': construction and use in MMIIB, ending in MMIIIB, reconstruction and use in LMI A, ending in LMIB-II, with some reuse in LMIIIA (Fig. 82). "Λ \ wm* ^ 2m 82. Choiromandres: plan of the site in 2006. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 24th EPCA. Also visited by Evans in 1896 was the upland region of Ziros, connected to both the Xerokambos/Ambelos and the Goudouras regions of the southeastern coast (Brown [2001] 225). The region was surveyed by a team led by Keith Branigan in the 1990s (Branigan [1998]; cf. AR 41 [1994—1995] 71), which documented habitation from Late Neolithic to Roman. High places On his travels in Crete in 1898 Arthur Evans identified a 'fort' at a site he called 'Gaiderouphas' to which a bronze dagger in the Herakleion Museum (HM 624) was attributed (Brown [2001] 261, 326-27). Pendlebury ([1939] 297) includes 'Gaiderouphas' among his 'sites with remains of uncertain but probably Minoan date', adding that Bosanquet purchased a white limestone circular libation table (HM 102; Warren [1969] 67 [P346]) and a bronze axe (Buchholz [1959] 36 [9]) from Agios Stavromenos, north of Anatoli, probably the same site. Faure ([1958] 513-14) also notes house remains and ceramics here and at nearby locations. In 2012 Yannis Papadatos (Athens) commenced excavation at this site 500m directly north of the chapel of Agios Stavromenos on a summit (95 lmasl), known properly as Gaidourophas (ID2896); in the first season (of five) two rooms were cleared to floor level and the date of the site established as Neopalatial. Gaidourophas has been compared to Zominthos (ID3408), even higher at almost l,200masl, on a small upland plateau on the approach to the Nida plateau from the north (Fig. 83). Excavations recommenced here in 2004 and continue under Eft Sapouna-Sakellaraki (ASA). In 2012 work focused on the central building, clearing several ground-floor areas, mostly floored in schist, and removing debris, in the form of compacted red clay and timbers, from the flooring of a second storey; access was via a staircase (in area 19). The high status of the building is suggested by the presence of polychrome wall-painting and a possible lustral basin, as well as the discovery of a fragmentary bronze vessel (area 43), a Late Minoan IA bronze male figurine in characteristic pose (area 28) (Fig. 84) and a lentoid seal depicting a scorpion (area 54), all fallen from the upper storey. The project is unusual in maintaining an informative blog (http://interactive.archae ology.org/zominthos/category/field-notes-2013/; cf. AR 57 [2010-2011] 72), one of whose highlights in 2013 was mention of the discovery in area 53 of a Linear A inscribed offering table. One possible interpretation of the site is that it was a way-station on a 'pilgrimage route', probably from the east, through the Krousonas gorge, to the Nida plain and the Idaean Cave (ID2091). Excavation at this Bronze and Iron Age cave sanctuary was another 83. Zominthos: view of central building looking northwest. ©ASA. 84.

In addition to cave sanctuaries, themselves not always located in high places, the peak sanctuary is one of Minoan Crete's most characteristic site types, often inter-visible, with both low-lying settlements and with each other {cf. Soetens et al. [2008]). Well-known examples are Iouchtas, south of Knossos, Kophinas, high in the Asterousia mountains southeast of Phaistos, and Vrysinas, south of Rethymnon {cf. AR 58 [2011-2012] 69). Most date to the Middle Minoan (Protopalatial) period and have been associated with the emergence of 'palaces', but a small number, including Iouchtas, either commence use earlier and/or continue in use into the Neopalatial period. Peak sanctuaries are particularly well attested in the distinctive, highly dissected landscape east of the Ierapetra isthmus, but investigations in 2001-2004 confirmed the identifi cation of four new examples in central Crete. Two are in the eastern foothills of the Ida massif. Korphi tis Kerias, high to the south of the village of Gonies (ID3634) overlooking the north side of the Krousonas gorge, was excavated by Adonis Vasilakis (then 23rd EPCA) in 2001. A bronze figurine had been recovered in 1966-1967, while Vasilakis found fragmentary clay human and animal figurines and ceramics over an area of ca. 350m2, as well as burnt soil in cracks in the rock. The site is inter-visible with the known sanctuaries of Philioremos and Pyrgos (ID2845) to the northwest and north-northeast respectively. Overlooking the entrance to the Krousonas gorge on its opposite, south, side, and also presumably inter-visible, is the sanctuary of Korphi tou Tarou at about l,300masl on Mount Goumos (ID3623; cf. AR 51 [2004-2005] 112) investigated by Giorgos Rethemiotakis (Herakleion Museum). Material here, also found in rock crevices, included sheet-bronze strips and double axes, miniature amphorae and figurines (mostly animal) and ceramics of Middle Minoan III(A) date, as well as a fragmentary circular hut-like model, apparently with modelled 'horns of consecration'. Below the peak lies a Late Minoan IA and LMIIIC settlement at the Rizoplagies location {AR 39 [1992-1993] 71). Giorgos Rethemiotakis also investigated two peak sanctuaries in the Pediada region: Sklaverochori Stou Mamaloukou (ID3627; cf. AR 50 [2003-2004] 79-80) (Fig. 85) and Liliano Kastelli Kephala (ID3625; cf. AR 50 [2003-2004] 79). Stou Mamaloukou was the earlier, in use in Middle Minoan IA-B and abandoned in MMIIA, when it was succeeded by Kastelli Kephala, abandoned in turn in MMIIIA (Rethemiotakis and Christakis [2011] 212). Stou Mamaloukou is remarkable for a circular structure (2m in diameter) at the north end of the summit with large amounts of obsidian (both flakes and cores) and some MMIA ceramics. Four deposits around the peak contained ceramics and figurines in rock crevices; the ceramics (mostly conical or carinated cups, but with some other shapes) in the westernmost deposit dated to MMIB, those in the other three to MMII. The figurines comprise human (male and female, including a pregnant female) and animal examples, the animals predominantly cattle, some explicitly modelled as bulls. The small- and medium-sized figurines are solid, but the large ones (some up to 0.5m tall) are hollow, a feature without precedent in the Protopalatial period. A hollow male figure, estimated as 0.9m tall, is unique in Protopalatial deposits. Clay building models, one showing a second storey, and circular periboloi are also 85. Sklaverochori Stou Mamaloukou: figurines in situ within rock cavity. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 23rd EPCA. attested, as well as modelled landscape features including rocks. The finds at Kastelli Kephala, though similar in type, were less plentiful (ca. 10% of the number) and the material dated to MMIII. Figurines include animals (mostly bulls, some goats) and humans; there is a If-shaped períbolos model that the excavator likens to the sanctuary depicted on the Zakros stone rhyton. Both sanctuaries lie ca. 2km (Stou Mamalouka to the west, and slightly closer, Kastelli Kephala to the south) distant from the important Minoan site of Kastelli (cf. AR 44 [1997-1998] 114; more recently ID1813, ID3632), occupied from Middle Minoan IB at least into Late Minoan IA. Only ca. 10km to the west lies the major local centre of Galatas, situated on the ridge-top of Galatiani Kephala, occupied from Early Minoan to LMIII, with a gap in MMII and a short-lived 'palace' in MMIII to LMIA (ID2778; cf. AR 56 [2009-2010] 186 and earlier reports going back to AR 47 [2000-2001] 127-28). (Summaries are provided of the 2001-2004 excavation seasons at Galatas in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B5; [ID3617, ID3619, ID3620, ID3621], but this information was already presented in AR 48 [2001-2002] 105-06; 49 [2002-2003] 78-80; 50 [2003-2004] 78-79; 51 [2004-2005] 110.) Also in this vicinity, a few kilometres to the north, lies the site of Smari (ID192; ID3655), also on a prominent hill-top, occupied in MMI-II, then not again until LMIIIC and the Geometric. Finally, investigations in 2001-2004 at a site known variously as Vorno, Pyrgos or Prophitis Ilias near the village of Sampas (ID3636), ca. 5km north-northeast of Galatas, revealed two occupation phases: Early Minoan II and Middle Minoan I—II. A valuable overview of settlement and sanctuary use in the area is offered by Giorgos Rethemiotakis and Kostis Christakis ([2011] 213-15), who point out the importance of this agriculturally rich area southeast of the Knossos region, crossed by key land communication routes and bounded by the Lasithi massif to the east. They note a distinct discontinuity in settlement and sanctuary use in MMII, as noted at the sites discussed above, and also the region's links to the open-air sanctuary of Kato Symi in the Víannos region further to the southeast. More data will soon be available to explore the history of this key region when the Galatas Survey Project (ID786), which inventoried 169 sites from the Neolithic to the Ottoman period, and the broader Pediada Survey (ID787) are published.</page><page sequence="62">62 JOHN BENNET The world of the dead Among the most frequent and regular discoveries on Crete are tombs, as those already noted above in eastern Crete demonstrate. As ever, the area east of Rethymnon, under considerable pressure from development, continues to contribute new data. There is an isolated Late Minoan IIIA2-B chamber tomb at Saounatsos (corrected spelling) near Pigi (ID1828, 1D3613), a group near Maroulas (ID2825, ID3610) and a new chamber tomb is reported at Sphakaki (ID3654) (Fig. 86) close to the extensive Hellenistic to Roman cemetery {cf. AR 58 [2011-2012] 61). It appears to have two use phases: transitional LMIIIA2/B and LMIIIB. At a place-name given as Arsani (ID3661), a LMIIIB chamber tomb has been excavated, presumably one of two mapped by Epameinondas Kapranos (25th EPCA) near the Arsani monastery (AWiC2 412, map 2). The tomb, entered from the north, but appar ently without a dromos, contained four lamakes, with bones under the larnax nearest the entrance; 24 pots (mostly drinking vessels) were recovered as well as three conical weights (conuli?) and a bronze dagger. Two more chamber tombs, almost certainly LMIII from their description, are also noted by Eleni Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) on the Kladovasilaki property near the village of Magnesia (ID3657) ca. 1.5km to the east: the first contained four lamakes and faience objects; the second was only partially investigated, but did contain larnax fragments. Finally, Eleni Papadopoulou also reports a LMIIIA2-B chamber tomb near the eastern edge of the Apokoronas region that borders Rethymnis to the west on the Kaniadaki property near the village of Kastellos (ID3596): although the roof had collapsed, human bones (five skulls) and remains of lamakes and ceramics were recovered. In the Mesara, renewed investigations have begun in the region of two well-known tholos tomb pairs. At Koumasa (ID3409) Diamantis Panagiotopoulos (Heidelberg) has renewed exploration in collaboration with the 23rd EPCA. In 2012 tholos tombs B and E were cleaned and excavations carried out in the settlement and sanctuary on the Korakies hill (Fig. 87). Most material from the excavations was Neopalatial, but one area produced evidence of Protopalatial occupation; the extent of the settlement is estimated at 'at least' 3ha (30 stremmata), but this seems quite large. About 6km northwest of Koumasa lies the village of Apesokari, where reinvestigation has been initiated by Georgia Flouda (Herakleion Museum) and Giorgos Vavouranakis (Athens). Flouda's study of tholos A, originally excavated by August Schôrgendorfer in 1942, involved restoration of the ceramic assemblage and study of funerary practice, and established a date range for the tomb from late Middle Minoan IA to the end of MMIB, with some indications of use in MMIII (A WiC2 132-43). Construction of tholos B, originally excavated by Costis Davaras in 1963 and re-examined by Giorgos Vavouranakis, was placed at the end of Early Minoan I or early EMIIA, with the addition of rooms to the complex in two phases: EMIII to MMIA and MMIB to MMIIIA {AWiC2 144-53). Further information about the project is available at http://apesokari.jimdo.com/. Further recently reported tombs are, from west to east: a Late Minoan IIIA rock-cut tomb above the south coast near Víannos at Keratokampos Kastri (ID3737); a small LMIII to Protogeometric tholos at Kera (ID3575), discovered during construction of a road linking the 'Μ - ~i ν' ■ s ■■ t: &gt; &gt;·4 ' f; ¿Spm· ?KMr .

News round-up First, some updates on major well-known sites. At Knossos a welcome addition to the series of BSA volumes documenting early material presents data from an enigmatic funerary monument and a nearby 'deposit' excavated in the 1930s on the northern end of the Monastiriako Kephali (Acropolis) hill west of the palace site (Preston [2013]). Study of material from the Knossos Urban Landscape Project survey (ID2900) continues with a focus on refining the chronology of prehistoric and Early Iron Age material; Todd Whitelaw (BSA/UCL), Adonis Vasilakis (for the 23rd EPCA) and Maria Bredaki (Institute of Cretan Studies) suggest that extensive but low density scatters of sherds identified on and flanking the Kephala-Isopata ridge represent extensive cemeteries. That ridge leads to Knossos's harbour area, the region of Poros-Katsambas (ID3651), which continues to produce material emphasizing its importance in the prehistoric period from Early Minoan to Late Minoan III. Ioanna</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 63 Serpetsidaki (23rd EPCA) reports on excavation carried out in 2008-2010 on two plots: the Kalogerakis plot, west of the Katsambas stream, and the Markopoulos plot on the Tripiti hill in Poros ca. 400m to the west. Both produced EMI to EMIII/MMIA ceramics and obsidian blades as well as Protopalatial structural remains founded on bedrock. Neopalatial material, although present in the Katsambas plot, is better attested on the Tripiti hill: earth and schist floors, red and blue wall-plaster, evidence of upper storeys and evidence of craft production (crucibles, grindstones, moulds and weights) and a pottery kiln (Fig. 88). Ivory objects, a gold earring, faience beads and a fragmentary triton shell were found in one rock-cut deposit. Material from the LMIB (floral and marine style), LMII-IIIA1 and LMIIIA2-B (including a probable metal lurgical furnace) periods is attested and the Katsambas plot has evidence of a burnt destruction in LMIIIB. In the Mesara, another section of the important coastal site of Kommos was published in 2012: House X at Kommos: A Minoan Mansion Near the Sea 1 : Architecture, Stratigraphy, and Selected Finds (Shaw and Shaw [2012]). Kommos functioned as a harbour-town for the sites of Agia Triada and Phaistos, where Irini Antonakaki (23rd EPCA) reports the discovery of Protopalatial walling on the Manousidakis property (ID3628; cf. A WiC2 285, fig. 2) near the village of Agios Ioannis, which lies ca. 700m south of the palace site. The existence of Kamares ware ceramics and coloured plaster here seems to confirm that the city surrounding the palatial centre reached at least this far at the time and this datum is used by Maria Bredaki (23rd EPCA), Fausto Longo (Salerno/SAIA) and Mario Benzi (Pisa/SAIA) as part of their assessment of the overall extent of the prehistoric settlement, based on preliminary results of the 2009 and 2010 seasons of the Phaistos Survey Project (AWiC2 274-87). They estimate that the Protopalatial settlement may have been as large, if not larger, than the Hellenistic one, with structures extending from the palace to Agios Ioannis and covering much of the lower slopes of Apfendis Christos, the upper acropolis, west of the palace itself (cf. Whitelaw [2012] 121-22). Vincenzo La Rosa (Catania/SAIA) summarizes the work of the Italian School at both Phaistos and Agia Triada in the period 2009-2010 (AWiC2 164-72). At Phaistos, restudy of earlier material, including that from the Kamilari tholos, continued; at Agia Triada, soundings within the Casa delle Sfere Fittili identified six phases in the complex spanning Late Minoan IA to LMIIIA2. The complex proper had two phases (III and IV), both within LMIB, the earlier contemporary with the destruction of the 'villa', the latter post-dating it, but still within LMIB. This observation reflects the emerging refinement of our under standing of this phase at Agia Triada and elsewhere (see also Puglisi in Brogan and Hallager [2011] 267-89). Slightly further afield, on the west slope of the hill on which the well-known Kamilari tholos tomb sits, Irini Antonakaki (23rd EPCA) notes the discovery of a badly preserved LMIIIA structure (ID3631) with paved floors and possible remains of a staircase. There are indications of other structures in the immediate vicinity, perhaps a settlement connected to the tomb's reuse in this period. Using the refined sequence from the Casa delle Sfere Fittili, Pietro Militello (Catania/SAIA) suggests that the spherical loomweights that gave the complex its name were attached to a loom in room 9 in level 112a (advanced Late Minoan IB, La Rosa's phase IV above), the main evidence for which is a series of five irregularly spaced holes in the floor. He goes on to propose, based on repli cation experiments carried out by the Centre for Textile Research in Copenhagen, that the size of the loom and weight of preserved loomweights imply production of specialized textiles within the overall economic framework of the site (A Witt 204-12). Militello also presents two fragmentary finds of actual thread (AWiC2 203-04), accompanied by analytical appendices. First are the remains of a piece of string attached to a bronze plate found in 1903 in one of the tombs in the LMIII cemetery at Kalivia ca. 1.5km east-northeast of Phaistos. Analysis by Christina Margariti (National Museum Athens) suggests the Kalivia find (HM 1903.688) was a three-ply string (Fig. 89), Z-twisted (in common with most of the very small number of extant threads from Bronze Age Crete) from an organic fibre, either flax or hemp (A WiC'2 213-15). The second example is a small (5cm by 10cm) collection of fibres including needles found in 1952 in a α β ¿m ΒΗΒΗΒΗ 88.

Christina Margariti in collaboration with Marie Louise Nosch (Copenhagen) and Irene Skals (National Museum Denmark) analysed this assemblage too, and they suggest it contains two types of plant fibre, not woven as a conventional textile, but that further analyses would be required for any specific identification (A Witt 216-18). Further significant finds are summarized here, from west to east. In the far west, more information is provided by Maria Skordou (25th EPCA) about the Middle Minoan (Protopalatial) site of Viglia Kalyviani (ID3603) that lay on the prehistoric coastline ca. 3-4km west of the town of Kisamos and ca. 2km northeast of the site of Phournados (cf. AR 58 [2011-2012] 60; AWiC2 525-36) (Fig. 90). About 150m2 was excavated, revealing three rooms and four irregular pits containing large amounts of ceramics, including utensils, storage vessels, bowls, cups and incense burners. The presence of multiple rhyta (four in one room, 11 in another), plus a natural triton shell suggests a ritual function to the excavator (Fig. 91). Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) adds some further information from excavation at two locations in the city of Chania, extensively summarized last year (AR 58 [2011-2012] 58-60). On Parodos Kanevaro on the Kastelli hill (ID3585), excavation revealed evidence for the earliest occupation of the site in the form of irregularly spaced postholes in the bedrock, perhaps for supports of Neolithic or Early Minoan dwellings; several walls and successive floor levels date to the Early Minoan period, while an Early Minoan II habitation level in another area was sealed by a large Early Minoan III to Middle Minoan IA ceramic fill. There was evidence of levelling for construction in the Middle Minoan period and, in addition to walls and a paved area, Neopalatial levels produced a Linear A-inscribed roundel (KH Wc 2123). Late Minoan III levels were largely disturbed by Geometric, Roman, medieval and early modern activity. At the junction of Siphaki and Daskalogianni Streets (ID3586), the remains were largely Neopalatial (MMIII to LMIA and LMIB), with some LMIII and later material. The Neopalatial remains include a building, founded in MMIII and in use to LMIA, defined on the west by a lm-thick wall and containing a room with painted plaster, some in situ, some from an upper storey. Elsewhere (AWiC2 29-31; ID3592) Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki also summarizes the discov eries at 1 Katre Street (ID 1855) covered last year (AR 58 [2011-2012] 59). Moving east, Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki and Eleni Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) provide an update on an important Late Minoan IIIC complex at Chamalevri Pateras (ID3607). The complex spanned the 12th century BC in two phases. The first was characterized by an open area with small pits and a building (now destroyed) to the west; within this phase a room was added, as well as a ceramic kiln. The second phase saw extension of the complex by six more rooms, each with successive floor levels, the latest marked by signs of intense burning. Further east, along the mountainous coast of Mylopotamos between Herakleion and Rethymnon, recent investigations have revealed a number of prehistoric settle ments, summarized by Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki (2006). Among these are the sites of Pera Galenoi (ID1832), Sidero and Katevati (spelling corrected here) (cf. AR 58 IS 90. Viglia Kalyviani: view of the site showing relationship to ancient coastline.

Eleni Papadopoulou and Loukia Flevari (25th EPCA) provide a valuable summary of the site at Katevati, which lies ca. 5km east of the coastal village of Bali (AWiC2 426-34; ID3649). The site, concentrated on the northernmost of three hills on a promontory protecting the east side of a small bay, was occupied in the Protopalatial and early Neopalatial periods (Middle Minoan IB to MMIIIB) and possibly abandoned before its destruction, perhaps at the same time as Pera Galinoi, ca. 10km to the east, with which it shares some characteristics. Excavation at that site in 2001-2004 (ID3614), on the hill of Kephali Soudas also overlooking a small bay from the east, described by Eleni Tsivilika and Eleni Banou (25th EPCA), concentrated on the southern, western and eastern sides of the building complex, as well as a wall enclosing the southern part of the site (Fig. 92). In the southern area of the building complex the fill included much burnt material, some datable to MMIIIB, and, among other finds, a metalworking crucible in a basement room. In the western and eastern areas excavation revealed evidence of burning in MMIIB-IIIA, as well as earlier material (MMIIA-IIB) in an open space to the west; a column base and painted plaster fragments were found east of the main complex. In 2004 a kiln was found.</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 65 It is unusual to be able to document through icant 52-room Middle Minoan III to Late Minoan I excavation, as opposed to surface survey, sites of all complex at Kephali near Sphendyli (ID2786) (AR 58 periods across a large area, but the creation of the artificial [2011-2012] 62, 66).

Further to the southeast, towards the village of Avdou, another MMIII to LMI structure, described as 'strongly-built', with clear evidence of destruction was investigated at the Mesochorio location; resemblances to similar structures in the area are noted. Finally, at the sites of Petras and Agios Leontios, ca. 500m west-southwest of the village of Avdou and just under 3km distant from the complex at Sphendyli Kephali, an extensive settlement was identified and excavated (Fig. 94). Founded in MMIII, it suffered damage late in that period and was reconstructed along similar lines before being abandoned, apparently suddenly, before the end of LMI. The complex was arranged around an open area and included paved corridors and roads, as well as some substantial monumental features. A significant find, incorporated into a later wall on the site, was a shrine-model (Fig. 95) with parallels only at Kato Symi. A number of other, less signif icant Minoan sites is noted on the map above (Fig. 93), as well as sites of later periods treated elsewhere. Clearly this infrastructure project has the potential to add considerably to our archaeological knowledge of this area lying between the coastal area of Chersonesos and the Lasithi plateau; the excavator tentatively suggests links with the palatial centre of Malia, but also notes the significant sites lying to the west in the Pediada already discussed above. Finally, the fifth and final season of excavation at the Early Minoan to Late Minoan III site of Sisi Boupho (ID2824) was completed in 2011 and a series of three preliminary reports covering all five years of the project was rounded out this year with admirable speed by Sissi III, a preliminary report of the 2011 season's results (Driessen et al.

Several of the more impressive discoveries from the beginning of the decade have been known to the wider archaeological community for some time, but their publication in ADelt allows us to discuss them in greater detail and in their broader context. Overall, this is an opportune time to look at how some of the fieldwork done between 2001 and 2010 might contribute to our view of post-Bronze Age Crete. Iron Age The largest single contribution of the 2012-2013 reports to the Iron Age came in the form of the publication of the 2001-2004 seasons at the settlement site on Prophitis Elias hill near Smari (ID3655): an account that rounds out earlier notices for the 1999 and 2000 seasons (AR 53 [2006-2007] 107-08; ID1814). The site of Smari has entered the literature principally thanks to the megara with stone-lined hearths at their centre. The buildings have been interpreted as a ruler's dwelling, with some relationship to Cretan hearth temples, and as a locale for communal dining (Mazarakis-Ainian [1997] 220-21, 296; Prent [2007] 143; Sjogren [2007] 153; Wallace [2010] 112, 119). After a Middle Minoan occupation, the site's main period of use covers the whole of the Iron Age from Late Minoan IIIC through to the Orientalizing period, after which a small cult place remained in use through to the Classical period (fifth to third-century BC figurines: Hatzi-Vallianou [2000]). The 1999-2004 seasons have helped to clarify the process of this site's development over the course of the Iron Age and to illuminate the buildings surrounding the central megara. The result is a picture that adds complexity and variety to the accounts of the site in the secondary literature. At the centre of the site there are signs of conti nuity of form, with the discovery of a Geometric floor and hearth, at a deeper level than the final Orientalizing-period floor and hearth of megaron B. The discovery of rooms, including at least one megaron (2B), which contained household pottery, stone tools and animal bones, outside the 'períbolos' wall to the southeast, complicates the plan of the site. The presence of ramps over the megaroid building 2A-2B-3 and the prodomos of megaron A, each of which sealed Late Minoan IIIC material, could attest to centralization and the formalization of access routes. One striking discovery was the presence of footings for stone built tables, to go along with the benches of megaron B, which could feed into the complex arguments over the function of rooms with hearths and benches in Iron Age Crete. Meanwhile, the discovery of a bone comb, together with beads of electrum and semi-precious stone, in layer 3 (LMIIIC to Geometric) of the prodomos to megaron D, should add a further element to the discussion of the status and function of these buildings. Smari represents one element in a trend between 2001 and 2010, which saw important work done at several Iron Age settlement sites in the central region of Crete. At Gortyn (ID203, ID267, ID780, ID1807, ID1915), excavations on Prophitis Elias hill conducted between 2005 and 2010 revealed an area of dense eighth- and seventh-century habitation, constructed on terraces alongside a major thoroughfare running east-west (Fig. 96). The buildings vary in size and in the number of rooms, but were accessed from subsidiary alleys, running north-south, rather than from the main thoroughfare itself. The rooms feature built benches, slabs for footing roof supports, thresholds with pivot-holes and installations such as an oval stone hearth, a millstone, platforms associated with numerous pithos sherds and a lekane embedded in the floor. Residual material attests to a preceding Protogeometric phase and the excavators suggest that the area was abandoned gradually in the seventh and perhaps into the sixth century BC. They take the presence of a later wall over the site to be the períbolos of a sanctuary, which, if true, would suggest, as at Smari, cult activity after the site fell out of use as a settlement. At Prinias (ID198, ID264, ID1918) the 2000s have witnessed both the publication of work done between 1969 and 2000 (Rizza [2008]) and the renewal of exploration at the site. Excavations conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009 explored the earlier phases under the floor of temple A and a large building to the south of temple B, revealing an intriguing pattern of continuities and discontinuities in the use of space. Three strata are reported below the celia and pronaos of temple A: the first dating to Late Minoan IIIC, consisting of drinking and cooking vessels, together with bones and burnt seeds; the second, dating from the Protogeometric B to Geometric periods, consisting of kraters, cups and a figurine in what seem to be structured deposits; and the third, dating to the Late Geometric and Early Orientalizing periods, consisting of a mixture of cups and cooking wares. The excavators, meanwhile, identify in the large building to the south of temple B an initial cultic function, which was replaced by craft activ ities at a later date. At Knossos (ID263, ID783, ID1811, ID 1920, ID2804, ID2815, ID2900) the 2000s witnessed the initiation of the Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP), whose team members argue, on the basis of their results (Fig. 97), that the model of numerous small settle ments for the site in the Iron Age should be replaced with one of a very substantial nucleated settlement (Kotsonas et al. [2012]). As if in confirmation, excavations conducted in 2010 uncovered further Protogeometric to Orientalizing burials (two chamber tombs, 17 pit burials and 12 cist tombs) at the Teke portion of the north cemetery, to add to the large number already known. Eleutherna (ID269, ID271, ID1827, ID2005, ID2768, ID2857) too, continued to reveal its striking sequence of wealthy Iron Age tombs. By 2009, the tally of burials at the site was said to have reached 400. In 2012-2013 we were lucky to see some of the finds from Eleutherna's Iron Age tombs showcased in the exhibition Princesses of the Mediterranean at the Dawn of History at the Museum of Cycladic Art (December 2012 to May 2013). Although many of the sites so far discussed have been known for a very long time, in recent years it has been work on Iron Age 'refuge' sites in the east of the island that has been most widely discussed, and that has set the pace of scholarship. This work in the centre of the island promises to rebalance the picture: already a view of the diverse types of community in the region has emerged, and fine-grained analysis of the patterns and forces underlying diversity should become increasingly profitable.</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 69 96.

A Geometric chamber tomb with two dromoi (one interpreted as belonging to a secondary phase) was found at Agios Ioannis near Phaistos (ID3628) (Fig. 98), but the region still has far fewer examples of the type than the area around Knossos. A small Late Minoan IIIC to Protogeometric tholos tomb was found at Kera Pediados (ID3575), on the road from Krasi to the Lasithi plateau. It contained four skulls, seven pots, a fibula, a stone tool and a bead. The tomb type, its contents and LMIIIC construction date are typical of the region.

Each pithos contained only bones Konstantinos, uncovered as part of the rescue work done but was accompanied by a couple of pots. This is primarily for the Aposelemis (ID3645) dam project.

To modern eyes, Kastri Keratokampou is off the for example, Alcock [2002] 106-09). The historical beaten track. But the reports of imports or off-island imita accounts emphasize the instability of the age, with warfare tions at this site seems to contrast with reports from the between the Cretan poleis and the involvement of major contemporary city of Praisos, where preliminary Mediterranean powers culminating in the hard-fought indications suggest that a very small proportion of the Roman conquest of the island in 62 BC. Certainly there assemblage consists of imports. This might suggest that were several prominent casualties, which are attested comparison of assemblages between settlements is a archaeologically, such as Praisos, excavated most recently profitable avenue of future research and is just the kind of by the BSA in 2007 (ID266, ID1794), and Phaistos, study to which the finds from even small-scale rescue currently being surveyed by SAIA and the 23rd EPCA excavations could contribute.

This is one of the 10.4.14). But the main contribution of the reports of seminal studies into this period - one of the pillars of 2012-2013 is to balance the other side of the ledger with Chaniotis' view of the economy (cited above) - and the a series of small-scale (but possibly for that very reason study of amphora production remains the most active and significant) continuities. Indeed, these continuities are productive arena for research in this period (see, for some of the membranes that give this period the distinct example, Vogeikoff-Brogan and Apostolakou [2002]; coherence referred to in the previous paragraph.

Hellenistic Crete. A large number of sites have revealed A related and equally fundamental axis of debate for Hellenistic domestic buildings, with deposits shedding our understanding of the period concerns the nature of the light on their use (e.g. Sphakaki ID3616, Rethymnon Cretan economy and the pace of economic change. One ID3615, Panormos Lake ID3611, Phaistos ID3628). A side of the argument views the economy of the island as building discovered at Agia Photeini (ancient Sybrita, being oriented primarily towards subsistence farming with ID3659) can stand as a good example, illustrating the minimal trade until very late in the Hellenistic or even the typical spectrum of finds. The building had the usual range Roman period (Chaniotis [1999] 184; [2005]). The other of serving pottery (cups, prochoes, etc.), implements of side of the argument believes that a major shift happened domestic life (lekanes, stone tools, lamps), facilities for much earlier, as the island opened up and became entwined agricultural storage and production (beehives, pithoi) and in the trade routes of the eastern Mediterranean (Harris textile production (loomweights), but also a few more [1999] 357-58; Perlman [1999]; Watrous [2001]; luxurious goods (fragments of metal vases).

In the secondary literature Keratokampou are indicative of Crete's involvement in the appearance of the latter type has become emblematic wider trade networks and cultural trends (ID3637). More of the realignment of Cretan lifestyles to broader Hellenic fine-grained studies have been relatively rare on Crete (one 'norms' and a concomitant change in social and political recent exception is Gallimore [2011]). However, there are structures (Westgate 2007).</page><page sequence="74">74 MATTHEW HAYSOM It is through the various rescue excavations at Chania (ID3587, ID3588, ID3589, ID3592) that we can perhaps gain a glimpse of the variety of urban space. Excavations in a relatively central portion of the city, at Plateia 1866, revealed Hellenistic buildings with pebble and plaster floors which replaced Late Classical buildings with beaten earth floors. Just to the east, at the junction of Peridou and Ypsilantou Streets, excavations revealed a monumental Roman building with a well containing fourth-century BC material beneath it. Heading out of the ancient city to the south, excavations on Botsari Street uncovered Hellenistic buildings with dirt floors and a dirt road running between them, while on the western outskirts there is an interesting area with a cobbled alley, tombs and workshops. The single greatest corpus of new material this year comes from Late Classical to Early Roman cemeteries. The information on these is amongst the most detailed in the latest volume of ADelt and the sites providing the evidence cover most of the island with Itanos (ID3570), Ierapetra (ID3569), Agios Nikolaos (ID3583) and Schisma Eloundas (ID3579) represented in the east, Chersonesos (ID3629) in the centre of the island and Aptera (ID3584), Chania (ID3590, ID3591) and Polyrrhenia (ID3601) in the west. Several of these sites have been worked on for some time or have been repeatedly worked on over the years. Altogether this makes for a tremendous dataset, which could potentially shed a great deal of light over a whole range of issues in this period. Interesting patterns immediately jump out. There are several consistencies that seem to run across the island. The dead, for instance, are often laid in a supine position, with the head to the east, or child burials are frequently accompanied by astragaloi. At both Ierapetra and Agios Nikolaos these are said to have been scattered around the children's legs. In other cases there seem to be interesting divergences between sites: at Chersonesos, for example, oinochoae/prochoes seem to be amongst the most common grave goods and only a couple of lamps are mentioned, whereas at Aptera lamps are said to be the most common grave goods and only one oinochoe is mentioned. Occasionally these patterns of difference between sites are very striking: it is only at Chersonesos, for instance, that horse burials are mentioned, an extremely unusual phenomenon for the period. A host of questions, inspired by pioneering work done on Greek burial assemblages elsewhere, could be asked of this material. What accounts for the differences and similar ities between sites? Why, given pre-industrial child mortality rates, are there so few child burials mentioned (for example, only two out of 58 burials at Agios Nikolaos)? What, therefore, was the status of those children that have been found? What underlies the wealth differentials, so that one grave at Agios Nikolaos might have a lekane, an unguentarium and a loomweight, whilst others contained gold jewellery or ivory beads in a pyxis? Or, given the overall consistencies in grave goods, how do we explain occasional finds such as terracotta masks, eggshells or metal wreaths? These days it is pretty much accepted that status in life cannot be straightforwardly read from grave goods, and the overall homogeneity of the record is probably the backdrop against which patterns and striking instances should be understood. Many of the tomb types, like the tile graves, and grave goods, like the lekythoi or ungüentaría, will be immediately familiar from more general Greek patterns in Late Classical, Hellenistic or Early Roman burial. Others, like the late fourth-century nine-chambered graves at Chania, are more exotic, with parallels in the eastern Mediterranean, on Cyprus, in Palestine, Egypt and Cyrenaica. An explo ration of the external influences on Cretan burial patterns, therefore, is likely to be profitable and related to the themes of economy and trade just discussed. One area related to burial is the epigraphy of death - the various epigrams of this period. A whole series of themes could be examined by looking at the epigrams and the archaeological record in parallel: individual versus community identity or attitudes to death for instance. A systematic comparison, an examination of the contrasts and interconnections between the materiality of the graves and the written memorials placed upon them, could be extremely fruitful. One potential obstacle to such a study will be that many of the stone stelae seem to turn up as spolia, reused in the walls of tombs or nearby buildings. But, while this might impede one-to-one comparison in many instances, it should not prevent a more general overlaying of patterns from being illuminating. At the very least, tombs like those excavated at Polyrrhenia (ID3601, cist tombs associated with transport amphorae) give an extra contextual dimension to supplement entirely textual approaches to nearly contemporary epigrams from the same site, such as the famous example that seems to allude to the supposedly primitive institutions that are the focus of many text-based discussion of Crete: 'Adrastos, you who were famous out of the agela, loathsome fate has brought you down, to Acheron the place of groaning' (IC 2.23.30). As with the urban sphere, it is Chania (ID3590, ID3591) that gives us the best perspective on the variety of burials from a single site. The graves are reported in two clusters. The first came from various properties on Renieri Street, just to the west of the ancient city. Some of the tombs there were of typical types - cist, pit and tile graves - but some, at least, contained exceptional finds. A double cist grave (Fig. 99) with plastered stone walls, for example, contained, in one of its cists, an iron strigil and a wreath of bronze leaves, myrtle flowers painted blue, faience rosettes and yellow painted fruit. Trenches and pyres with burnt pottery and figurines were associated with the graves. Further cist and tile graves were found to the south on Igoumenou and Vamvaka Streets. As with the Renieri examples, the graves were oriented north-south. The Renieri plots also revealed two Hellenistic multi-chambered 99.

Both were used in Roman times, but the surviving Hellenistic burials and grave goods were consistent with those found in less exceptional tombs of the period. One burial, for instance, was simply accompanied by a strigil and four ungüentaría. Other finds include gilded clay jewellery, mirrors, coins, eggshells, lamps and figurines. Obviously, there is some more complex pattern here than a straightforward correlation of investment in an exotic tomb type and the placing of the most exceptional grave goods to accompany the dead. Some distance to the north of these graves, much closer to the sea, another broadly contem porary cluster of burials was discovered in the area of the National Stadium. Here 81 burials were uncovered, cut into a deep layer of sand. Many of the burials seem consistent with socially marginal groups. Sixty of the burials were enchytrismoi, containing premature or new-bom infants. One of the pit graves contained a man accompanied by iron shackles (Fig. 100) and another at least 12 bodies of individuals in poor physical condition accompanied by a lekane, a lamp and a lagynos. This is the second mass-grave reported from the city. The other, further inland, contained at least 40 individuals and has been interpreted as a burial of defeated enemies (Bourbou and Niniou-Kindeli [2009]). But social marginality may not be the whole story, as there are also two tile graves in the cluster and general finds include such items as an iron strigil and silver danake (Fig. 101). In short, Chania, in spite of the overburden of the modem city, is offering up a veritable death-scape; fuel surely for any number of potential lines of research. The grand themes of Crete's Hellenistic history, its conservative traditions wrestling with social upheaval, economic devel opment accompanying piracy, inter-polis rivalry, a flour ishing slave trade and a strategic position on blossoming Mediterranean trade networks, intersect the evidence from these burials in innumerable ways. This should be more than enough to demonstrate the potential and appeal of Crete's archaeology after the Bronze Age. 100.

(2001) The Archaeology of Ancient Greece U00BC-300BC (Cambridge) THE AEGEAN ISLANDS (PREHISTORIC TO ROMAN) Zosia Archibald Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool Introduction Strabo, who visited the island of Gyaros in 31 BC, described it as a village (kdmion, Kcbptov; Strabo 10.5.3) inhabited by fishermen. This comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the Aegean islands today. Modem photographic promotions give local fish specialities, and the modest, traditionally whitewashed homes of the fishermen responsible for fresh catches, plenty of colourful emphasis. Not all the fish on offer in the islands are locally caught today, and many visitors arrive by air, rather than by boat, following one of the principal maritime itineraries (which do not, as it happens, normally include Gyaros). More surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Strabo refers to Gyaros at all. This little island, no more than 17km2 and thus never big enough to provide much of a land-based way of life, even for a small community, lies midway, as the crow flies, between Kea to the west, Kythnos to the southwest and Syros to the south, and is flanked to the northeast by the long chain of islands which in effect extend the mountains of Euboea southeastwards into the heart of the Aegean - Andros, Tenos and Mykonos (map of the Cyclades). The geographer was simply articulating a memorable anecdote, according to which the Gyarians sent their own ambassador to Octavian in the hope of getting a reduction of the 150 dr tribute that had been laid on the inhabitants' reluctant shoulders. The Gyarians were not quite as inconspicuous as they wanted to appear in the eyes of Octavian, or as miserable as they looked to Strabo. There are rock-cut inscriptions recording the passage of Gyarians on Syros, which belong to post-Antique times (to the fifth to seventh century AD; see Reger [2004] 733, for further references). The fabric of the islands of the Aegean is rock; rocks are not just the foundation, but the fundamental resource of the island landmasses. Rocks formed the natural environment in which early inhabitants moved and operated. Investigating the rocky landscapes and exploiting the potential of stone was one of the great strengths of the Aegean archipelagos throughout history; cutting, polishing and inscribing rocks were the natural consequences of this familiarity (Fig. 102). Much of what 102. Andros, Palaiopolis: rock inscriptions dated to the fourth century BC. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 21st EPCA.</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 77 is contained in archaeological reports on the islands concerns rocks - rock-built fortifications; paved floors and roads; wall foundations; rock-cut tombs and niches; carved pillars, columns and statues. Stone is all too easily taken for granted because of its familiarity. It is by no means the only material used in the built environment, but the high survival rate of fine-grained and compacted Aegean rocks makes the heritage of the Aegean islands comparatively unusual. Far less scholarly attention has focused on the exploitation of organic materials in the remote past, although recent research on Crete shows what might be done (see Haysom, this volume). The plants and wildlife that have become acclimatized to island habitats deserve study in their own right (Davis [1965-1988]; Panitsa and Tzanoudakis [2006]). Trees are limited to areas where a deeper sub-soil has developed, mainly on the larger islands, in rare coastal uplands or above sheltered shore lines. The geology of the islands has shaped their physical appearance and their modes of living - schist and gneiss chippings for pavings, wall foundations and superstructures alike. Rocks have become the life blood and the preoccupation of many island inhabitants. Yet there is still much to be understood about how the early inhabitants came to understand the properties of the rocks that shaped their environment. On Keros, a recent BSA project conducted by Myrto Georgakopoulou has studied traces of metalworking on the Kavos peninsula, in the north of the island, and on the smaller island of Dhaskalio opposite (Fig. 103). Although Keros appears devoid of ore resources, a small smelting site for both pure and arsenical copper was identified on the Kavos promontory, north of the Special Deposits. Significant evidence for metal working and metal consumption was recovered from all three settlement phases at Dhaskalio, with the great majority coming from the best documented final phase. Frequent copper spills, tuyères and some metallurgical ceramics, probably from crucibles and moulds, testify to copper working, and a litharge fragment suggests that cupellation was also practised. The excavated contexts date to the later Early Bronze Age, when tin-bronze was already known in the Cyclades; yet most copper-based artefacts at Keros were of arsenical copper, with very few tin-bronzes among the analysed finds (Fig. 104). As at other contemporary sites in the southern Aegean, most copper artefacts are consistent with Cycladic sources, while the tin-bronze is incompatible with an Aegean provenance. The almost total absence of metal from the Special Deposits South and North suggests that despite the metal-rich character of the settlement, metal was not among the 'prestige' artefacts deposited on Kavos. Gyaros may be a small island, but that does not mean that its inhabitants were without significance. How we think about the Aegean islands depends on our perspective. For Aelius Aristides, writing and speaking about the world of the Roman oikoumene in the second century AD, the islands of the Aegean were at the very centre of the known world (On the Aegean Sea 44.3-4, 12; Constantakopoulou [2007] 1, 20, 26, 176, on the orator's use of the term, 'dance of the islands'). Yet it is understan dable that the geography of the islands was not systemati cally analysed in classical antiquity. The 'Cyclades' is a term that evidently emerged at a fairly early date and is certainly attested in Classical sources, beginning with Herodotus (5.31.2) and Thucydides (1.4); the 'Sporades' somewhat later (for example Ap. Rhod. Argon. 4.1711; Metálworking on Ohaskalio i Copper smelting on Kavos 103. Keros: locations of metallurgical activity on the Kavos promontory and on Dhaskalio. © BSA, Cambridge Keros Project. 104. Keros: metal hoard. © BSA, Cambridge Keros Project. Strabo 2.5.21, 10.4.1; Reger [2004] 732-33, with further references), but this distinction may owe at least as much to the origin of the writers as to the broader knowledge, within the Aegean, of its various parts. One thing that is very clear to current researchers is that travel in and around the Aegean sea began early in the Holocene. The most recent evidence of this precocity is a fishing village at Ouriakos, on Lemnos, dated to 12,000 BC, which is under investigation by a team from the University of Thessaloniki under Nikos Efstratiou (1D1348). Another very early settlement, near the village of Loutra on Kythnos (investigated by Vassiliki Giannouli and Adamantios Sampson of the 21st EPCA, in collaboration with the University of the Aegean), belongs to the ninth millennium BC. A rich collection of Mesolithic stone tools, as well as shells and fish bones, accompanies the simple arrangement of light structures made from a combination of materials (1D3244). Evidence of occupation during the Early and Middle Neolithic in a series of caves on Chios (first investigated by a British team in 1938 and currently being reinvestigated by a team from the EPSNE) includes polished stone tools as well as obsidian and flint flakes. The remote location has also preserved a wide range of wild animal species, including the brown bear, leopard, wolf, dog, fox, mustelidae, cattle, goat, domesticated goat, domesticated sheep, wild boar, deer and hare, as well as other, unidentified mammals,</page><page sequence="78">78 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD reptiles, birds and fish, together with a range of molluscs and other shellfish (on the 2002 season, see ID3081; on the 2004 season, see ID3089). Arguably one of the most spectacular Neolithic sites to be investigated during the last decade is Strophilas on Andros (ID3098; cf. ID3226; see AR 56 [2009-2010] 158-59; AR 58 [2011-2012] 16; ID2690) (Fig. 105). Investigations began here in 1999, when traces of round houses and an apsidal building (apparently the oldest structure so far identified on this site) were found in the west-central part of the island (ID536). Since then, sections of the substantial fortification wall, which is visible along its whole circuit and estimated to be ca. 100m in length, have been investigated. This is currently the oldest fortification of its type in the Aegean. Dating from the end of the Late Neolithic II and the transition between the Final Neolithic and Chalcolithic, it constitutes an impressive example of defensive architecture. The circuit is between 1.6m and 2m thick, and composed of a double face with stone and clay packing in the intervening space. Its height reaches 2m in places (perhaps as high as 4m originally) and it is strengthened by bastions. There was also an outer defensive construction (dubbed a protei chisma). In 2012, Christina Televantou (ASA/21st EPCA) continued her investigation of the northern rampart down to its foundation on rock (Fig. 106). Investigation of the occupation structures, as well as a pit deposit inside the circuit, has produced an abundant range of ceramic material and terracotta figurines, as well as obsidian tools, some bronze tools and carved stone, including at least one marble figurine with a triangular head (ID1298). Not least among the discoveries are rock cut graffiti on the rocks outside the fortifications and on the fortification stones themselves. These include ships, (Fig. 107) either in isolation or in groups, as well as geometric patterns, including spirals, and marine creatures, including fish. An anthropomorphic form may be human or divine - perhaps a xoanon (ID 2690). In 2012, 29 new ship representations were registered (bringing the total to over 100), as well as images of animals, notably deer (ID3098). ANDROS Φ StrophilasX o 5 10km 105.

Multi-period sites and projects The relative under-development of many of the Aegean islands has, until recently, provided scholars with a splendid time capsule for exploring the past. The survival of various kinds of stone constructions in particular, with limited intervention by later societies, has preserved features that, in another, more intensively inhabited setting, might have disappeared from view. Locations that have become historic centres of population represent a different kind of challenge to historians and archaeologists. In some cases, these locations continue to be highly populated and access to older levels is today more usually the result of urban development projects than research initiatives. Alternatively, there are locations that were used for extended periods in the past, but are no longer the primary focus of modern development. Although development work produces information that often covers rather small areas, and is therefore difficult to interpret, such disco veries can reveal unexpected aspects of the historic record that help us think differently about the past. The fruits of the last decade in the islands include examples of all these</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 79 kinds of complex historical textures. One example from the 2012 season illustrates the advantages and disadvan tages of exploration. Close to the Frankish tower constructed by the Duke of Naxos on Paros in 1260, removal of overlying modern structures exposed the foundations of the Archaic Temple of Athena Polias along with 220 fragments of marble (ID3181) (Fig. 108). Recent investigations within the city of Paroikia on Paros reflect the chequerboard pattern of different periods that urban rescue excavation can create. A section of the ancient city wall and the eastern port of the city were explored in 2006, together with a sculptor's workshop west of the rampart section and a ceramic workshop (ID720). In the Kastrovouni district of the city, a complex of Hellenistic houses, partly overlying earlier (Archaic) structures, was found in 2002 (ID3180) (Fig. 109). In the area of Agios Panteleimonas, traces of a Classical and Hellenistic cemetery were uncovered between 1999 and 2003, with carved monuments, including a fragmentary kore and several bases (some inscribed), as well as two sarcophagi (ID3097, cf. ID3198). On Amorgos, Georgos Gavalas has faced a similar challenge in a number of rescue excavations within the town of Katapola, in advance of development work. In the Vekri plot, material from the Classical period to the third century AD was discovered (ID3300, cf. ID1335). In the Nomikou plot, where a Late Roman house with mosaic pavements was discovered in an earlier season, traces of structures and materials dateable between the second and seventh centuries were detected (ID3301, ID3302, ID3303, cf. ID555). At Skeparnies, a rescue excavation on two rocky hilltops produced evidence from different periods between the Bronze Age and Byzantine times, with a preponderance of material from Early Cycladic II (ID3304). Investigation of an area of caves on Siphnos by the EPSNE aims to extend scholarly understanding of the range of human activity in remote areas. Some of these sites show traces of later activity, from the Classical and Hellenistic periods, as well as earlier times. Caves in the vicinity of Gethron, Anemordili Cave and Megalogianni Cave, have produced a range of flaked tools and blades. In the last of these there is a mining gallery. The activities probably belong to the Bronze Age rather than to the Neolithic period (ID3085). Excavations in a private house in the area of the Kastro, Siphnos, produced a section of the ancient circuit wall of the city, with a range of ceramic evidence from the Late Geometric to the Hellenistic period (ID3246, see also ID3246), while Hellenistic and Roman traces, perhaps involving industrial activity, and much tile, were found in another part of the Kastro in 2003 (ID3248). At Vathy on Astypalaia, Andreas Vlachopoulos (ASA/Ioannina) surveyed the locality of Ellinika during 2012 (ID3099) (Fig. 110). A Proto-Cycladic settlement and a Hellenistic tower were registered in previous years on the north side of the island, overlooking Vathy Bay (ID862). Pottery collected on the slopes and scree below the summit included fragments of Proto-Cycladic II and III fabrics. The rocky approaches are strengthened on the east side by a hefty dry-stone períbolos wall. Other finds include obsidian flakes and stone tools. The limestone slabs of the summit are decorated with prehistoric graffiti which concentrate around three paths, leading to the three main entrances to the Proto-Cycladic site. The Hellenistic tower forms part of a later refur bishment, which also included water cisterns and a range of other structures, either side of a corridor. The excavators compare this complex to the fortified mansion at Agia Triada, Amorgos (ID554). The finds at Ellinika are both Hellenistic and Roman (dating from the second century BC to the second century AD). A series of n shaped structures along the beach, made of thick stone walls, were used to pull boats up onto the shore. At Methymna, Lesbos, repairs to the drainage system north of the city, at Dapia, revealed an apsidal structure with three parallel rooms, immediately overlying Archaic levels, but with traces of activity extending into the Hellenistic age. As part of the same investigations, a series of structures was revealed, including fifth-century BC coroplastic workshops with four circular kilns and a fourth century BC house (House 'A') to the east of them.

Rhodes, Ialysos: Middle Bronze Age monochrome cup. © Ministry of Culture and Sport: 22nd EPCA. The maritime perspective of ancient settlements has been reinforced by recent work conducted by the EMA, whose investigations of coastal waters and harbours is beginning to reveal the offshore character of the islands. One of the clearest examples of this work comes from the harbour at Methymna, Lesbos, where the footprint of the modern port appears to overlie the ancient one (ID3113). Surveys of coastal waters are producing evidence of rock cut niches which can sometimes be identified clearly with shipsheds (as at Poiessa, Kea; ID2047). A wreck that contained Chian and Samian amphorae, probably of Late Classical date, lies in the strait between Chios and Oinousses. The discovery of his wreck has led to an extended collaboration between the EMA, MIT and Woods Hole Océanographie Institution (ID3178, cf. ID649, ID827: 10 shipwrecks logged, dating from Late Classical to Byzantine times; see also ID3132 Malamos Bay, Chios, ID3103 Cape Mytikas, Chios, ID3101 Pachytholos, Chios). The Bronze Age The most significant Bronze Age site of the eastern Aegean has been identified in the nucleus of activity dateable to the second half of the third millennium BC, northeast of the Sacred Way in the area of the later Heraion on Samos (ID3057). Five separate phases have so far been identified above a large Chalcolithic deposit, stretching from Early Bronze Age I to the beginning of EBAII. In 2012, two phases dateable to the Middle Bronze Age were investigated (first half of the second millennium BC). Finds show lively contacts with Asia Minor, the Cyclades, Thera and the Cretan palaces. The evidence of this phase fills a gap in the chronological sequence in this part of the site between the Protogeometric and Archaic activities under the Rhoikos altar located in 2009. Systematic excavation continued in 2012, in three separate sectors, at the fortified site at Chalandriani, Syros (ID3097), under the direction of Mariza Marthari (ASA). On Cape Plaka, Andros, Christina Televantou (21st EPCA) began, in 2002, to investigate a major Bronze Age site exhibiting two phases. The rich finds (mainly pottery), date the occupation phase from Early Cycladic II to the beginning of Middle Cycladic (ID3227). A series of pits, dating to the Early Cycladic period, was discovered in 2003 at Aigiali, Amorgos (ID3308), in the southern foothills of Grambala, in the northwest of the island. At Raos, Thera, northwest of the modern town of Akrotiri, Mariza Marthari (21st EPCA) conducted rescue excavations in 2003 and 2004 along the main road between Akrotiri and Fanari (ID3225). Traces were revealed of a Late Cycladic I settlement over an area of 240m2, with well-preserved wall foundations constructed in local stone and unbaked brick (as well as a few examples of baked bricks) and with traces of painted wall plaster. The rich ceramic repertoire makes it clear that this site was contemporary with Akrotiri and perished in the same volcanic disaster as that site. On Siphnos, an Early Cycladic I cemetery first disco vered by Christos Tsountas has been further investigated by Zozi Papadopoulou (21st EPCA): this lies on the coast of Lazaros Bay, southwest of the Akrotiraki peninsula (ID3251). In the southeast of the island, a fortified acropolis site dateable to Late Helladic IIIC was located on a naturally protected peninsula (ID1306: 'Tis Baronas to Phroudi'). Traces of Bronze Age activity, which have yet to be fully explored, have been noted at other sites - at Agriokastro, Antiparos (ID2139) and 122 burials were recovered from a partially excavated Early Cycladic cemetery at Tsikniades, Naxos (ID658; cf. burials at Tsimindiri, Despotiko, ID659). At Ialysos, Rhodes, a suite of three Late Bronze Age rooms, dateable to Late Helladic IA, contained destruction deposits from LHIA to Late Minoan IB and LHIIIA2. A potter's kiln, constructed in LMIB/LMIA, contained pottery in the fire chamber belonging to LHIIIA2-I1IB (ID3370, cf. ID3371, ID3372, ID3369). The Iron Age In AR 58 ([2011-2012] 19-27), Irene Lemos presented a survey of recent activities on Early Iron Age sites in central Greece and Euboea. Maria Stamatopoulou extended this geographical framework into the northern Sporades, with an up-to-date synthesis of work at Kephala on Skiathos, identified with the site of ancient Palaiskiathos, referred to in Classical sources, but already a key centre along the coastline between the Sporades and the ports of the Thermaic Gulf from the tenth century BC onwards, judging by the ceramic sequence at Kephala (AR 58 [2011-2012] 92 with further references). In 2012, Alexander Mazarakis-Ainian (Thessaly), in collaboration with Argyro Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA), worked in 11 trenches, distributed between the ramparts of the urban centre as a whole, on the acropolis, in the lower town and in the associated cemetery (Fig. 112). Investigation of the circuit wall continued in sector Tl.1.1—Tl.1.3, south of the area exposed in 2011. The parallel alignment of a wall behind the rampart at this point, and extending in a southerly direction, as well as tiles found in the vicinity, indicate a series of rooms that follow the direction of the ramparts. The excavated material is predominantly Archaic in date, but earlier ceramic evidence (Protogeometric and even Subgeometric) points to the longevity of these constructions. A number of trenches in the lower city revealed traces of stone structures and roads paved with cobble stones. One of these, against the southern rampart (T1.3), exposed</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 83 an elliptical plan (T8) (Fig. 113). This construction evidently had stone foundations and a paved floor, with an unbaked brick superstructure. The elliptical building abuts the fortification wall in such a way as to suggest that it preceded it. The defensive circuit can therefore be dated to the Geometric period. Protogeometric and Subgeometric pottery was found at a lower level, west of the elliptical building T8, along with a substantial quantity of shells, including cerastoderma glaucum, patellidae and murex (Fig. 114). The last might indicate production of purple dye (which would make tenth-century BC Kephala comparable to Toumba at Thessaloniki; see ID828). Fragments of Aegean commercial amphorae recovered probably date from the 11th century (cf. Catling [1998]) (Fig. 115). Investigation of the summit of Kephala produced traces of structures, perhaps including a sanctuary building, judging by finds of votives (terracotta figurines, glass beads, bone needles). The ceramic evidence extends from the seventh century BC to Classical and Hellenistic times. Investigation of what is thought to be a cemetery, on Xanemo Bay, is still in progress. See further: http://extras.ha.uth.gr/skiathos/gr/season 2012.asp. At Hypsili, Andros, Christina Televantou (21st EPCA) extended the excavation of this key site, in 2003, to the interior of the acropolis and the area immediately to the east of it (ID3228). Two structures (A and B) were disco T5-T6 112. Skiathos, Kephala: topographic plan of the site of Palaiskiathos, 2011. © University of Thessaly (courtesy of A.

The first of these may be connected with the Protogeometric building to the west of the temple, while the other, aligned with the temple's períbolos wall, evidently belonged to an earlier phase. The latest phase of Archaic occupation of the acropolis was traced south and east of the temple, as far as the Archaic building identified in earlier campaigns. The street pattern in the residential part of Hypsili had a north-south orientation. Nineteen structures have been exposed so far, of varying dimensions.

In its initial phase, the wall reaches between 3.2m and 3.7m in depth. In its latest phase, its thickness reached 6.2m in places. An entrance has been discovered in the north side of the east wall and there was a sally port on the narrower southeast side (ID3230) (Fig. 116). Recent work on the Archaic rampart and adjacent structures at Xobourgo, Tenos, was reported in AR 58 ([2011-2012] 17; see ID2633, ID2068). In the sector that incorporates the House of the Columns, at Hephaistia, Lemnos (Zone 17), Emmanuele Greco (SAIA) directed an excavation in 2012 to determine the main construction periods of the Archaic ramparts on the isthmus. Achille Adriani's trenches of the 1930s were identified in Sondage 18, while Sondage 19 produced late eighth- and early seventh-century BC fabrics, as well as Grey Ware and G 2-3 Ware (Fig. 117). Below this level was a destruction deposit from the Late Bronze Age (ID3059). The DAI, under the direction of Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier (in collaboration with the University of Cyprus and Vienna University), continues to reveal impressive evidence of votives at the Heraion on Samos (ID3057). Investigations in 2012 were conducted in two sectors - northeast of the Sacred Way and east of the Great Altar (Figs 118, 119). The finds here correspond to the periods preceding the construction of the Rhoikos altar in the first half of the sixth century BC. A levelling deposit (A), dated to the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth century BC, contained ash, votives, animal bones, pottery and other evidence of feasting. Among the more notable finds was an upturned bronze phiale, a miniature bronze wheel, handmade clay figurines, a serpentine mould for the production of glass pomegranates (Fig. 120), pomegranates in other materials, fragments of raw azurite and malachite, as well as alloys resulting from bronze working, for use as pigments. Cypriot imports, including limestone lion figures and faience figurines (probably made in Naukratis), a Mesopotamian glass bowl (Fig. 121) and the sculpted handle of a bronze tripod in the form of a male figure from the first half of the eighth century BC (Fig. 122) were also found. Proto-Corinthian pottery of ca. 640 BC brings this phase to an end. On Siphnos, Stavroula Sarmatzidou-Orkopoulou (EPSNE) investigated the Cave of the Nymphs, southeast of the village of Kamares (ID3083). An accumulation of archaeological finds was discovered in a natural gully of the cave, including Archaic pottery as well as incised and glazed sherds, and animal bones. An inscription in Ionic dialect - NYM&lt;hEÍ2N HIEPON - dateable to the late sixth or beginning of the fifth century BC, points directly to the cult. 116. Andros, Hypsili: gateway into the acropolis.

The Sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis at Mandra, on Despotiko, the offshore island west of Antiparos, has produced fragmentary statues of kouroi within the construction of one building inside the complex (ID2329, ID3072, cf. ID655) (Fig. 123). In 2011, investigations were conducted in Building 0, a square construction from the second half of the sixth century BC with later modifi cations. It was equipped with drainage and paved. A large pithos was evidently connected with bathing. Under the eastern end of this complex was an earlier structure, belonging to the first half of the sixth century BC. Building © was in turn destroyed and replaced by the Southern Complex, made up of reused materials, including the lower parts of two kouroi, dated ca. 530-520 BC. Building E, which resembles a temple in form, also yielded reused kouros fragments (Fig. 124). At Kremasti, west of the city of Rhodes, Toula Marketou (22nd EPCA) discovered a series of installations in the area of the known Archaic and Classical cemetery (ID3375). A well and pit, containing Archaic and Classical pottery, may be associated with chthonic practices within the cemetery. The Classical period Compared with earlier and later periods, the Classical period (fifth to fourth century BC) is not as well repre sented in recent fieldwork. At Palaiopolis, Andros, an area lying against the eastern city wall, south of the circuit that separated off the acropolis from the residential part of town, was investigated in the two Pertesi plots. Plot 1 revealed a 5m section of the eastern city wall, made of dressed stones. Plot 2 revealed a rock-cut inscription, dated to the fourth century BC, and cuttings, thought to be libation holes, evidently belonging to a sanctuary. A 7.75m section of the eastern fortification wall was also uncovered (ID3229). The bulk of data relating to the fifth and fourth centuries BC comes from burials. On Kythnos, a number of tombs, pit graves and rock-cut tombs, largely robbed of their materials, was discovered in the northern cemetery of Episkopi in 2002 and 2003 (ID3242, ID3243). On Kimolos, a new rock-cut tomb found in 2004 joins a series of similar burials discovered since 1969, close to the shoreline at Ellinika (ID3245). On Kea, five cist or pit graves, one pithos burial and one pyre grave were documented at Gialiskari (ID3309). Conservation and restoration work has dominated activities in the Sanctuary of Apollo, Délos (ID1366). The earliest levels identified to date have been dated to ca. 750-725 BC (see ID843 for 2008). The Hellenistic period On Kythnos, Alexander Mazarakis-Ainian (Thessaly), in collaboration with Theodora Papaggelopoulou and Maria Koutsoumpou (21st EPCA), continued investigations of the Hellenistic building on the hilltop of Vryokastro, in the upper part of Kythnos town (ID2983). Five rooms were investigated (Z, IT, E, A) in the western part of Building 5, which has been studied since 2009. It is located on the central plateau, close to the sanctuary identified there. Building 5 was constructed in the mid fourth century BC and refurbished, probably in the second century BC, following destruction. It was probably abandoned in the first century BC. The monumental style and associated finds (votives are particularly prominent, including lamps, pottery bowls, figurines, bone combs, weights, miniature vases, jewellery and animal bones) attest to its public character, being perhaps the city's prytaneion. Room IT contained mainly Hellenistic material, but there are also finds from the seventh century BC. Room A contained many of the votives already referred to. Among the more exotic items was an amethyst scarab bead, a faience scarab and a small vase inscribed NIKIAI AYKIOI, evidently intended to contain lykion (medicine), judging by a similar example from Ephesos.

A retaining wall and part of the drainage installa tions, as well as a fountain, belong to the Archaic period. These were evidently connected to the Tunnel of Eupalinos. The Hellenistic phase of the structures includes an andron, equipped with a mosaic dating to the second century BC, although the walls date from an earlier period (third century BC or even late fourth century). In the Roman Imperial period, the complex was refurbished on an equally pretentious scale, with a nymphaeum. One of the excavated rooms (Room 3) adjoins a cave connected with a rectangular cult structure, an altar-eschara, containing a thick layer of ash and finds dateable between the late seventh and beginning of the fifth century BC. There are also traces of Archaic cult activities inside and below Rooms 1 and 2.</page><page sequence="88">ZOSIA ARCHIBALD At Palaiopolis, Andros, on the west coast of the island, Lydia Palaiokrassa-Kopitsa and Nikos Gkioles (Athens) proceeded with the excavation of the agora. Hellenistic and Roman structures were investigated on the upper terrace, where an Early Christian structure dated to the third century AD partially reused materials from the Hellenistic structure incorporating a propylon (ID3060). The peristyle building identified earlier was found to have had at least three phases, the latest of which is thought to belong to the early second century BC and the earliest to the Late Classical period. Below the debris associated with the construction of the peristyle building, there were traces of metallurgical production associated with four hearths, placed on foundations of unbaked brick. A casting pit was found immediately under the stylobate. Lydia Palaiokrassa Kopitsa (2012) provides a summary of the architectural history of the agora in the recently-published volume, Tout vendre, tout acheter. Pottery sherds from the excavation fills spanned the Geometric to Byzantine period. The lower terrace has revealed a three-aisled basilica, succeeded by a single-aisled church in the sixth century AD. The chancel and presbyterion of the basilica were built directly on top of the stylobate of the Hellenistic portico, with the north wall of the former becoming incorporated into the wall of the basilica. An inscription that refers to the local month of Heresion (dating from the second half of the fifth century BC) and Hellenistic graffiti from the gymnasion in the city of Andros have also been studied (ID2054). At Kalofana Xenotafia, Amorgos, a square Hellenistic tower, built of pseudo-isodomic, rusticated masonry, was found to contain two large, well-preserved storage pithoi (ID3307). An analogous defensive tower has been documented at Karthaia, Kea (ID2071; cf. the tower of Agia Marina, Kea, ID2961). Also at Karthaia, Eva Simantoni-Bournia and Tania Panagou (Athens) undertook the task of excavating the Hellenistic theatre, which is referred to in third-century BC inscriptions (ID2960) (Fig. 125). On Delos, Cécile Durvye (EfA/Aix-Marseille) continued investigation of the Aphrodision dedicated by Stesileos, assumed to be the man who appears among the priests of Apollo in 304 BC (ID3404). The excavations of 2012 have helped to specify the various phases of this sanctuary's history. The sanctuary is situated at the base of the hill supporting the theatre. Its eastern part was used as a quarry for granite blocks and its western part, where the ground is more even, for the foundation of a storage structure (2010 season), as well as other cuttings. The area selected for the construction of Stesileos' foundation was evidently used for craft activities, similar to those to the east and west. Towards the end of the fourth century BC, a small temple was built here, the entrance of which was dominated by the statues of the founder's parents, on either side of the doorway, which were contemporary with the original foundation. Besides the temple, the sanctuary included an oikos, built to a high specification, and an altar, oriented to the east, whose long sides were set parallel with the long sides of the temple (Fig. 126). The floor level of the sanctuary was raised between the third and second centuries BC, probably because of residual damp from the river Inopos (Fig. 127). See also Durvye (2009); ID1953,1D844). Excavations of the extensive Hellenistic property, La Maison de Fourni, on the northeast side of Fourni Bay, Delos, continued under the direction of Helène Wurmser (EfA/Lyon 2) (ID3405) (Fig. 128). This is one of the largest and most complex residential properties on Delos, a 'suburban' villa, slightly separated from neighbouring properties and terraced into the hillside. Although the formal limits of the property have not yet been confirmed, excavation indicates that the southern rooms were connected with agricultural and craft activities, both on the side of the road (along which the property extends a distance of 70m) and in the direction of the countryside. The excavators therefore consider the building to be a precocious form of the Late Republican Italian country villa. Investigation continued, in 2009, of the circular building located in the western part of the Agora of Theophrastos and dedicated, in all probability by an agoranomos, to Apollo and Hermes (ID1369) (Fig. 129). The inscription belongs to the early first century BC (ID1835; see also Moretti et al. [2012]). The well preserved foundations and, in many cases, superstructures of Hellenistic residential accommodation offer opportu nities for studying storage facilities. A number of properties in the Quartier du Stade are being explored to estimate the storage potential of these structures, both at the domestic and the artisan levels (ID2636). The creation of more compact storage facilities, with the creation of mezzanine floors, represents one of the options. The area south of the Agora of the Competaliasts probably served as one of the areas where bulk commodities could be stored. These different kinds of storage accommodation are among the facilities contributing data to a wider research programme, Entrepôts et lieux de stockage du monde gréco-romain antique (http://www.entrepots-anr.fr). On Kos, a plan to unify the archaeological plan of the ancient city (triggered initially by the 1933 earthquake) was substantially developed with funding from the EU, under the Community Support Framework, during the 1990s (ID858). At Kardamaina, Kos (ancient Halasarna), remains of the Temple of Apollo, in the form of a rectan gular sekos, with an entrance distyle in antis, have been exposed below Proto-Byzantine levels (ID3061). The most extensive and the most systematic disco veries of Hellenistic urban remains have taken place on the island of Rhodes, and particularly in the city of Rhodes itself, where the ancient street system, identified from aerial photographs, as well as survey, has been confirmed 125.

Sections of the western rampart of the civic circuit wall were discovered by Nikos Christodoulidis (22nd EPCA) whilst conducting rescue excavations in two plots between Akti Miaouli and Orphanidou Streets, where the fabric of the Hellenistic masonry is visible, together with a stone-lined water channel for draining away waste water (ID3338) (Figs 130,131). Nikos Christodoulidis has also exposed a section of the southern rampart in the Atsidi plot, on Dendrinou Street (ID3340) (Figs 132, 133). In some places, the forti fications, built of dressed soft limestone blocks, lie directly on natural rock. The construction is dated by pottery of the late third century BC in the associated fill. In front of the main circuit was a proteichisma (Fig. 134). In the northeast part of the Medieval city, a section of ancient circuit wall, oriented north-south, was discovered on Argyrokastrou Square (Fig. 135). The fabric is composed of large soft limestone blocks and the wall is 3.5m wide in this sector. The new section of the fortifi cation wall now makes it possible to connect the surviving Hellenistic fabric found near the Temple of Aphrodite (whose location is opposite the modern square) (ID3320). Drainage repairs and modern development work has extended this spatial information within the residential areas of the ancient city of Rhodes (cf. AR 58 [2011-2012] 165-66). On Ippotou Street (ID3382) traces of an ancient road surface have been identified, paved with the local lartios stone. In Cheimarras Street (ID3324), west of the Medieval city plan, a late Hellenistic system of drains, combining stone linings and terracotta tubes, tracks the civic drainage system along one of the main, paved streets of the ancient city (P38). Dating material was provided from the fill used to raise the road surface along the eastern side of this road, where residential structures were located. The material of the fill, which coincides with that of the houses and their associated drainage system, dates between the third and first centuries BC. On Navarinou Street, again west of the Medieval city, three separate pavement levels were discovered at the intersection of roads P10 and P28 in the Gavrilaki plot (ID3325) (Figs 136,137). At the level of the topmost, Late Roman, surface the road was narrowed by a wall; contem porary with this, to the south of the road, was a plaster 130.

Road P28 has been preserved for a length of 13.8m, is 4.5m broad and its surfaces can be dated as a result of material associated with the make-up of each of four pavings. The oldest belongs to the third century BC, the latest in the second century BC. A third-century BC house is located east of P28. Below the street levels, a system of terracotta pipes, three from P28 and two from P10, intersect in a reservoir made from the base of a large vessel, surmounted by the upturned end of another pot, covered by a stone (Fig. 138) (cf. also ID3334, Afstralias Street, and ID3337, Ranada Street). The second civic gymnasium in Rhodes town has been identified on Peloponnisou Street, south of the Medieval city circuit (ID3332; cf. AR 58 [2011-2012] 166). The construction level contains pottery from the first half of the third century BC. The ancient cemeteries to the west, centre and south of the later Medieval city of Rhodes feature heavily in the most recent ADelt volume and are summarized in AR 58 ([2011-2012] 166-67). The successor volumes of ADelt will add to this picture (see especially ID3358, central cemetery).</page><page sequence="94">94 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD ΟΔΟΙ Ν ΑΥΑΡΙΝΟΥ 136.

Outside the city of Lindos, during construction work on the Gadoura barrage, Hellenistic structures were disco vered as well as an extensive Byzantine rural property, including traces of residential and storage facilities evidently belonging to a rural farmhouse, with drainage works and a cistern. In an adjacent property, some 400m away, similar facilities together with a wine press were located (ID3380). Also in the environs of Lindos, another two rural properties of similar type have been discovered in advance of construction of the Kritinia barrage (ID3381). A floor and walls were discovered in the vicinity of a small cemetery, with a second property ca. 100m to the southeast of the first. Among the finds were fragments of black-glazed and sigillata pottery, lamps, relief-decorated bowls, weights, tiles, glass and 21 copper alloy coins. 137.

At Kamari, Thera, Charalambos Pennas (2nd EBA) investigated an architectural complex south of the Church of Agios Giorgios Thalassitis, which incorporated a wine press and baths. The construction of the baths can be dated to the third century on the basis of ceramic finds and lamps (ID3224). Another Roman bath complex has been disco vered at Tsigouri, Seriphos (ID3241). Rhodes city has produced some splendid new examples of domestic installations from the Roman Imperial period. On Pindou Street, in the modern town, the plan of a colonnaded house was exposed, dated by coins to the second century AD (ID3223) (Fig. 139). At the centre of the house was a courtyard, paved with pebbles. Two rooms on the southern wing were linked to the courtyard by a portico. The northern wing was evidently intended for storage purposes. On the west may have been the garden. Here, a basin, lined with hydraulic mortar, linked to a system of pipes, while an apse at the end of the basin was probably planned to hold a statue. In the southwest comer of the trench traces were discovered of an earlier residence, dating to the third century BC, which included an amphora store. A Late Roman house, dating from the fourth century AD, was discovered in 2002 on Amerikis Street. It contains a pebble mosaic depicting Eros in the courtyard (ID3327).

A research project entitled Sanctuaries and Cults in the Cyclades was approved as part of a research grant attached to the Chaire Internationale Blaise Pascal for 2012/2013 awarded to me by the French state and the Regional Council of Ile-de-France. The project started in October 2012, in collaboration with the University of Paris 1 (Francis Prost) and the École pratique des hautes études (François de Polignac), and is still in progress. I have been assisted by Jean-Sébastien Gros, who designed the related website and database, Yannis Kalliontzis, who is respon sible for the compilation of the written sources associated with the cults in the Cyclades (mostly the inscriptions referring to cult and cult places) and Olga Kaklamani who is responsible for compiling the basic bibliography and catalogues of cult places. The chronological scope of the project is restricted to the Geometric and Archaic periods, though the developments of the Classical era are largely taken into account. The Hellenistic and Roman periods have not been included in the compilation of the archaeo logical data, with the exception of late inscriptions which could refer to possible earlier cults. An interactive website and online database are in preparation and will be launched soon, hosted by the server of the Department of History, Archaeology and Social Anthropology of the University of Thessaly. The research project has two main goals. The first is to assemble all the data related to the 'internal' archaeology of the Cycladic sanctuaries. Under the term 'internal' we consider the organization of the sanctuaries (the architec tural layout, the individual monuments, the archaeology of the offerings and the finds in general), the divinities worshipped, their groupings and the methods of recog nizing them, and the identity of the worshippers (sex, age, social status). Within the same group of topics we aim to tackle questions associated with belief systems, the manners in which divinities were honoured, sacralization, sacrifice and various developments through time. The change through time of the function of sanctuaries as arenas for competition and status display between local or wider elites is also a matter of interest, and may be studied in relation not only to other Greek sanctuaries but also to contemporary burial customs. The second axis of the project aims to place the Cycladic sanctuaries in context. The main issues are the notion of insularity in relation to the sanctuaries, the topography of the sanctuaries, their spatial location, their role as centres of contact facing the sea, not only in the Aegean context but also in the wider Mediterranean, the existing maritime networks, the circulation and distri bution of offerings and the mobility of worshippers. Indeed, the Cyclades were a crossroads of maritime travel, and for this reason the sanctuaries here have a more diver sified character than several mainland sanctuaries. The presence of Cycladic offerings and worshippers at other sanctuaries of the Greek world is also a matter worth considering. The role of the 'insular' sanctuaries in the genesis of the polis is a major research theme which must be studied in comparison with parallel developments in other areas of the Greek world. These two research directions will be investigated in a joint publication, which will be co-edited by me, Francis Prost and François de Polignac, and will include many studies from archaeologists active in this field of research. Fairly recently, a synthesis of the Cycladic sanctuaries of the Protogeometric and Geometric periods was published (Gounaris [2005]). A more recent PhD thesis has assembled all the available evidence of cult places from the end of the Bronze Age down to the end of the Archaic period (Mermoz [2010]). Although it contains minor errors, this is a very usefiil study, and one of its strengths is that the author has visited most of the sites included in his thesis. More general publications, such as Archaeology. Islands of the Aegean (Vlachopoulos [2005]), Nà&amp;ç, appsviÇovraç oto ypóvo (Sergis and Psarras [2006]) and Island Identities. The Contribution of the Secretariat General for the Aegean &amp; Island Policy to the Research and Promotion of the Culture of the Aegean Archipelago (Alvanou [2013]; in Greek and English, based on the Congress held at the Goulandris Museum in Athens, 25-26 April 2013), are useful as they contain articles or chapters concerned with research conducted in the sanctuaries and written by experts. A useful critical study of the inscriptions of certain islands has been published by M.B. Savo (2004): Culti, Sacerdozi e Feste delle Cicladi dall 'età arcaica all 'età romana I: lo, Nasso, Sifno, Serifo, Citno, Siro. The pioneering excavations of the 1960s to the mid 1970s of Zagora on Andros are currently entering a turning point through the publication of the much-antici pated Zagora 3, which will be the last volume of the original Australian excavations directed by Alexander Cambitoglou (ASA/Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens). A new phase of field research conducted by the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens is currently underway (http://www.aaia.chass.usyd.edu.au/ Zagora/). These events were marked by an important colloquium, entitled Zagora in Context, held in Athens on 20-22 May 2012; the proceedings are in preparation (J.-P. Descoeudres and S. Paspalas [eds]). A seminal excavation on the island of Andros in past decades is that of Hypsili, directed by Christina Televantou (21st EPCA) (Fig. 140). A small booklet summarizing the results and providing a bibliography has been published recently (Televantou [2008]), but much of what has been found remains unpublished. Hypsili is extremely important not only for the study of early cults in the Cyclades, but also because it is perhaps the best preserved settlement not only of the Geometric but also of the Early Archaic period. Andros is perhaps the island with the best preserved early settlements and, together with the significant work conducted at Palaiopolis (see recently Palaiokrassa-Kopitsa [2007]), we are lucky to possess significant data allowing us to understand complex issues, such as the act of synoecism and the nature of and reasons for the persistence of cults and rituals in places which had been abandoned by their inhabitants. Major advances in our knowledge of the earlier stages of the formation of the Cycladic sanctuaries have occurred thanks to the excavations directed by Nota Kourou</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 97 (Athens) at Xobourgo, Tenos, following in the footsteps of Nikolaos Kontoleon. Over the past decade or so, an important cult place has been revealed, allowing us to observe the transition from an open-air cult space to a roofed temple (Fig. 141). The main element of the cult was the lighting of fires in pits, in which offerings were thrown during a ritual. This open-air cult was soon replaced by a probably roofed building (a 'sacred house' in the excavator's terms), decorated with the earliest terra cotta frieze, yet known, with figured decoration (Kourou [2005]; [2008]; [2011]) (Fig. 142). Concerning the sanctuaries of the towns of Koressos. loulis and Poiessa on Kea, the basics have not changed since the 1990s (see Whitelaw and Davis [1991]; various articles in Mendoni and Mazarakis Ainian [1998]). On Karthaia, on the other hand, at the sites of the Sanctuaries of Apollo and 'Athena', restoration works, conducted under the consecutive direction of Vassilis Lambrinoudakis (Athens) and Eva Simantoni-Bournia (Athens) between 2001-2009, have not only changed the appearance of the sites, but have also led to significant results, allowing a better understanding of the history of the two urban sanctuaries. These have been published in a lavishly-illustrated small book, written in three languages (Greek, English and French) (Simantoni-Bournia et al. [2009]). The restoration work within the Doric peripteral Temple of 'Athena' (Fig. 143) led to a better under standing of the three phases of the temenos and the edifice, from the late sixth century to the early fifth century BC. Evidence beneath the pteron and the celia has proven that cult activities and a first retaining wall date to at least the middle of the sixth century BC. The Classical Doric propylon and Building D (a prostyle Doric building) were also restored. The latter presents two phases, dated in the fifth ('proto-D') and late fourth/early third centuries BC. The edifice may have been either a Prytaneion or a Bouleuterion. The restoration work at the Temple of Apollo Pythios also led to some interesting results. There were six columns in antis in the prostasis, and the order would have been Doric. A small side doorway was found at the end of the long north wall. The proposed construction date of ca. 530 BC, based until now on the architectural details, was confirmed by the discovery of pottery in the temple foundation trenches. 140.

There is not much information that the Parians had in mind the creation of a pan-Ionian yet available, although from an Early Archaic graffito found sanctuary of equal importance to that on Delos, which was, earlier (in 1979) it seems that there may have been a seemingly, in the beginning, under the influence of their sanctuary here dedicated either to Poseidon or, more likely, rivals, the Naxians.

This resulted in a vast body of essential material contributing to an understanding of the period. The exceptional excavation work of archaeologists such as Anastasios Orlandos, Dimitrios Pallas, Georgios Soteriou and Ioannis Stampoltzis among others has provided scholars with a huge body of church data. However, data for analysing Late Antique settlements, industries and trade has not been as extensive. This has resulted in a near total reliance on the churches and historical sources such as Libanius, Zosimus, Procopius, Eusebius and Theophanes for an understanding of Late Antique Greece. There is some useful textual material, such as references to territory and diocese, as discussed in Hierokles' Sixth Synekdemos and the Acts of the Ecumenical Councils, as well as, of course, the Theodosian Code. The increasing amount of secular data resulting from rescue and research excavations and survey has made a significant contribution to redressing the outdated view of the Late Antique period as one of decline. In some respects this view was perpetuated by the fact that it is caught between the high points of the Roman Imperial and Byzantine periods. The underlying context was, therefore, seen rather in terms of decline (particularly urban) and less in terms of the birth of significant artistic and social endeavours. The Late Antique period for the purposes of this chapter will be taken to run from the mid fourth century AD (the foundation of Constantinople) to the creation of the thema of the Helladikon between AD 687 and 695. In many respects, a key feature of this period is the monumentalization of Christian practices through the wide-scale construction of churches. Nevertheless, the terminology used to define the period is somewhat problematic. Scholars refer to this period as Early Byzantine, Late Roman or Late Antique, while colleagues working in the western provinces commonly refer to it as Early Medieval. The terminology would not, of itself, be such a problem, were it not for the different emphases that alternate chronologies entail. For example, to some, 'Late Roman' may mean the third to fourth century, while to others it may be the fourth to fifth century. The issue is most acute in the case of short archaeological reports. What is more, the use of different chronological assump tions impacts on contextualization and comparative analysis. In the last few decades, however, there has been a perceptible change in approach to the period. Scholars have been pushing the agenda forward, not just in Greece but across the Mediterranean lands. The Late Antique Archaeology series published by Brill and edited by Luke Lavan and others is an excellent resource produced annually which deals with different themes in Late Antique studies through a series of edited papers (for example Lavan and Bowden [2003]; Lavan and Mulryan [2011]). In terms of the archaeological data, scholars such as Guy Sanders, Kathleen Slane and Eleni Tzavella are challenging traditional ceramic chronologies (for example Sanders and Slane [2005]) which in turn tasks Late Antique specialists with having to be reasonably fluid about their interpretation of significant events within the period (for example earthquake damage or other destruc tions). Because of focused projects such as those on the Corinthian landscape, the East Korinthia Archaeological Survey (see articles by Caraher, Gregory and Pettegrew at http://corinthianmatters.com/archprojects/ekas/ekaspubli cations/) and Sikyon (Lolos [2011]), as well as work at specific sites such as Corinth (Sanders [2005]), Kenchreai (Rife [2012]), Argos (Oikonomou-Laniado [2003]) and Messene (Tsivikis [2012]), some areas of Late Antique Greece are becoming very well understood. Dimitris Athanasoulis' (25th EBA) excavations of churches in the Peloponnese (such as Agios Ioannis near Tegea and Skyllountia in Elis) may challenge perceived ideas about church chronologies and architectural forms. Scholars such as Anna Avraméa (1997), William Caraher (2003) and Iannis Varalis (2001) have taken a more synthetic approach to the study of the country, covering wider themes such as mosaics, churches, liturgical practice and Christianization. Some topics, such as the city (explored by Gregory [1982] and Saradi [2006]) or continuity and change of cult practice (Foschia [2009] and Deligiannakis [2011]), continue to be well-explored. Though it is clear that certain areas have become better known, the archaeo logical work undertaken within the last decade is highlighting how much more there is to be discovered and analysed. Rescue excavations continue to provide secular data related to infrastructure, domestic activity and industry. While new churches continue to be identified, underwater and landscape surveys are providing a welcome view of areas not previously well known in terms of Late Antique material. New finds in some areas such as the Cyclades and Argolid, which have been better known for material of the earlier periods, are showing just how vibrant these areas were in Late Antiquity. Rescue excavations Rescue excavations far outnumber research ones, and, although they are still largely focused on urban areas, synthetic analysis of the evidence will contribute substan tially to a more rounded knowledge of Late Antique society. In the past, it was quite difficult to identify Late Antique city locations (for example Knossos and Patras). However, with more concentrated excavation and survey work, it is clear that the positions of many of the Late Antique cities changed. In the case of some, such as Knossos, the Late Antique city moved somewhat north wards, towards the location of the earliest churches (KMF and Sanatorium Basilica: Sweetman [2004]), and Corinth may have moved eastwards (ID2488). In this case, and in others, the location of burials in previously occupied domestic space is a good indication of the city's modifi cation, for example at Patras, where Christian graves were found in an area connected to the earlier agora complex (ID3889). And a similar situation is noted at Nikopolis where a seventh-century cist grave was inserted into a villa and bath-house with further graves to the east (ID1665, ID3147). Current work on fortification walls around places like Nikopolis (ID 1698) (Fig. 146), Argos, Aspis (ID2635), Palaia Epidauros (ID3858) and Nauplion (ID3862, ID2415) will further enhance knowledge of the changing topography of the Late Antique city. Mortuary evidence in many cases helps to provide a good basis for discussion of the topography of the Late Antique city - at, for example, the site of Kenchreai (ID2491, ID2966, architectural phases and the cemetery).</page><page sequence="104">104 REBECCA SWEETMAN :Μηί;' o ^-ο Map 9.

Near Panormos, Crete a fourth- to fifth-century building contained plaster lined pits (ID3611). Late Antique occupation has been revealed on the summit and eastern slopes of a hill near Gadoura, Lindos, Rhodes (ID3380). Increasing numbers of rural villas are coming to light in Greece and often through excavation (not just survey). Many have industrial components, although, while evidence for domestic occupation has been extensive, indications of industrial activity are not yet as widespread. This may in part be because a refined date for the evidence may be difficult to achieve and it may be that many Roman industrial or manufacturing activities continued into the Late Antique period. For example, in 2002, at 6 Zakynthou Street, Same (Kephallonia) (ID3235), a 10 roomed structure dated to the Late Roman/Early Christian period was revealed. The excavator believes that it was probably used for commercial purposes or manufacturing, given the large deposits of pottery, glass, metal objects and coins. In other cases, workspaces were often converted from different types of space. For example, at the Tsagkaraki plot in Chersonesos, Crete, the northern part of the Roman bath-house was used as a workshop in the Late Antique period with the addition of a kiln and a hearth (ID3629). At the foot of the acropolis in Rhodes town, rescue excavation has revealed an area of circular pits, pipes and evidence of burning indicating a workshop of the Late Antique period (ID3328) (Fig. 148). Although there is work to be done on certain aspects of Late Antique life, such as business and manufacturing, it is encouraging that a much more comprehensive view of certain areas of Greece (particularly the Cyclades and the Argolid) in this period is now possible thanks to on-going archaeological work. The Cyclades The Roman period of the Cyclades has not seen much scholarly attention, save for the work of Sneeringer (2011 ), Mendoni and Zoumbaki (2008) and Sweetman (in prepa ration). However, it is clear that certain islands did well under the Roman Empire (Melos, Tenos and Andros), while others show little evidence for wider participation in the Roman network (Paros, Naxos and a range of smaller islands). Of potential interest here is that data from the last five years seem to indicate that some islands, such as Amorgos (see below) - which had been a place of exile in the Roman period - and Thera (ID3199), became increas ingly important in the Late Antique period. In 2001, northeast of the village of Kamari, a large architectural complex (600m2) consisting of baths and a wine press was revealed (ID1311, ID3199) (Fig. 149). Rescue excavations in the same village (ID3200) and at Perissa (ID3201) have revealed further evidence for Late Antique occupation between the fifth and seventh centuries (Fig. 150). Furthermore, it seems that the Oia necropolis (ID3224) was used intermittently from the sixth century BC to the sixth century AD (Tombs 3 and 4 being Late Antique).

Important survey work at Keros is also providing a similar picture of increasing occupation. The island has been renowned for its Bronze Age material; more recently collaborative survey work has revealed significant amounts of 'Late Roman to Early Byzantine' pottery at Konakia. In the same area, a three-aisled church with three apses has been recorded (ID2906). Rescue excavation work in 2004 on the Kastro at Siphnos (ID3249) revealed the foundations of a church. Excavations at Amorgos have been particularly forth coming in terms of Late Antique material, with houses at Katapola (ID3301) and workshops (ID3252; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B6, 181-82). The two workshops occupy space previously used for domestic functions. A cemetery area investigated in 2001 at Kat'Akrotiri revealed indica tions of a sixth-century ossuary (ID3302). At Marpissa, Paros, sixth-century tombs have been excavated (ID3216). However, as with the Roman period, there is still little comprehensive data on the island for this period, despite the fact that, like Amorgos and Thera, it was a bishopric. Although the bishoprics are likely to have been formed in the fourth century (at Thera in AD 342), a strong Christian presence was known even from the first century, as the catacombs on Melos demonstrate. It seems that Melos thrived under the Roman Empire, and it may have continued to do so in the Late Antique period. In recent years, in the town of Klima, trenches were opened up in the area of the Aveltion Shipping Company Ltd (ID3240), which revealed the remains of a street and at least two Hellenistic and Roman buildings, which were reused in the Late Antique period, perhaps with an industrial function, as one of the rooms contained a lime kiln (Fig. 151). Reflecting the results from a previous excavation nearby (ID543), it seems that the earlier Hellenistic/Roman building was being reused for another function. Late Antique mosaics are known from a number of Cycladic islands, particularly the larger ones of Andros, Melos and Naxos. Generalizations about the islands are such that it is easy to come across references to the abandonment of some islands after the Gothic raids in AD 268 (Kulikowski [2007] 19-20) which affected a number of islands, including Paros. However, the on-going work on the islands and new Late Antique material makes it likely that the islands were not as desolate in this period as traditionally believed, and the recent archaeological work indicates that the Cyclades may prove to be a fascinating area of study in terms of the Late Antique data. The Argolid Crete and Epirus have seen a steady Late Antique focus over the last couple of decades. The Argolid is another area where recent finds of Late Antique material have been enhancing the range of what is known of this period in the region. While the Late Antique city of Argos continues to be defined in terms of houses and other traces of domestic occupation (ID2414, ID3872) and mortuary data (ID1439, ID3832), other areas such as Palaia Epidauros and Troizen (ID3818) are proving to be impressive Late Antique towns. In both locations, buildings with coins and pottery and burials have been excavated. At Palaia Epidauros, a possible dye works was revealed on Akti Poseidonos with finds of crushed murex shell and a cistern (ID3858). Survey and underwater archaeology Survey and underwater archaeology are adding signifi cantly to knowledge of areas poorly understood in terms of Late Antique occupation. As noted above, surveys on Kea and Keros have produced significant ranges of material with great promise for further study, as has the Sikyon survey (ID1422) (Fig. 152). Geophysical survey has also revealed evidence for Late Antique buildings, such as churches, in locations like Philippi and Sikyon (http://extras.ha.uth.gr/sikyon/en/index.asp; http://archeo sciences.revues.org/1468). New archaeobotanical studies have been undertaken, for example at Thasos, where a Late Antique villa has been excavated to the north of the Artemision (ID635). The results revealed a wide range of plant and animal remains indicating to the archaeologists a group of affluent consumers (ID3416). Underwater surveys and excavations have revealed shipwrecks and evidence for harbour installations at, for example, Skiathos (ID2905) (Fig. 153), Kastellorizo (ID3173) and in the Herakleion Gulf (ID2897). In these cases, finds of amphorae (of fifth- to seventh-century date) and, in the case of Skiathos, lamps (of fourth- to sixth century date) have helped to date the wrecks and harbour activity. In the Euboean Gulf (ID2895) fourth-century wrecks have been identified through associated amphorae. The underwater evidence is particularly useful for areas such as Skiathos that as yet have produced no significant evidence for Late Antique occupation on land. With the expansion of underwater work, it may be that much more evidence will be forthcoming to help verify suggestions regarding trade and networks. It may be that the Cyclades became more prominent in the Late Antique period because of a return to primarily small-world trade. "w ■"* jar w.- ί 151.

Continuity of direct use The increased attention that is being paid to the refinement of ceramic chronologies will make an impact on defining Late Antique use of buildings and space. As noted above, there is considerable recognition in the scholarly literature of the continuing use made of cemeteries and buildings, and for similar functions, well into the Late Antique period. For example, in Athens, a bath excavated in the Makrigianni area was in use from the second to the seventh century (ID2894). A large bath suite excavated at Loutra Aidipsou, Euboea, seems to have been in use from the Early Imperial to Late Antique period (ID3427). In its last phase, burials were inserted into it. At Corinth, four settlement phases were identified on the Kakourou property dating from the Classical period to its most extensive phase in the Late Antique period (ID3788). The excavators suggest that the structure may have been a bath. At Kisamos a complex of four building phases from the Early Imperial to Late Antique period has been excavated (ID3622). The last phase consisted mostly of an outdoor space with a beaten-earth floor. As noted above, many cemeteries continued to be used in the Late Antique period, even while dedicated Christian cemeteries (associated with churches) were also in use. This is seen at Oia (Thera) (ID 3224), at Paliokklisi, Epirus (ID3154) (Fig. 154), in the North Cemetery at Patras (ID3891) and on Kephala Hill, Kastelli Pediados, Crete (ID3632). These last graves, and the associated settlement, which continued into the Late Antique period, may be connected with the Late Antique church in the modern village of Thronos, on the slopes below. The single Christian tile grave in the Classical to Hellenistic cemetery at Anapnoa in Corinth is a little more difficult to explain, and it may be that there are others yet to be found (ID3798).</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2012-2013 109 New Christian cemeteries are also well known. One Paliokklisi, Epirus (ID3J54) (Fig. 154) - may relate to a example was found during recent work at Argos later phase of Christianization. Late Antique churches Orestikon. Paravela (ID3080) (see below and Fig. 158); were constructed on the edges of many pre-Christian another was found at Leontion (ID3913) (also the site of sanctuaries, such as at Nemea, Delphi, Olympia and a Late Antique church) and a third at Gymno, Kato Epidauros, and the same is true for the triconch sanctuary Motsares (ID3838). At Kato Motsares 13 stone-built cist church at Dodona. Work around the Sanctuary of Zeus at tombs were arranged along three terraces and the date was Dodona has revealed evidence for domestic occupation, confirmed through the few finds and east-west orientation including drainage channels, two rooms and associated of the burials. At Kedres on Gavdos, Crete, a Christian material culture (ID3170). rock-cut cist grave has been identified (ID3594). Also in The evidence for the continuing use of buildings, Crete, at Vaphes Apokoronou, work on the Byzantine often for the same function, and the continuing use and church has revealed earlier cist graves dating to the sixth function of certain spaces (for example, as locations of and seventh centuries (ID3656). In a similar scenario, sanctuaries and churches) indicates a more gradual work on the Church of Agios Georgios at Drapanias has change in the Late Antique period as a result of political revealed 17 Christian cist graves which themselves had and religious modifications. While continuity of been placed in a Roman bath-house (ID3593). occupation is notable, there were clearly changes in the As argued elsewhere (Sweetman [2010]), it is likely Late Antique period (as noted above) that affected that there was a phased Christianization process in Greece different areas in different ways. Among them was city and much of the reuse of religious structures - such as the location - the move from urban to rural space (or vice conversion of the Hellenistic shrine to a Christian one at versa) - and there is also a reasonable amount of evidence 154.

Messene: church of the monopteros with mosaics. © ASA. 155. Messene: church of the monopteros with mosaics. ©ASA. for the modification of buildings. The changing urban landscape can be assessed in part through the examination of the reuse of buildings. In some cases, the insertion of graves in a domestic space marks a clear end to the original use of space. In other cases, the erection of a new building may mark a change in the use of a space, as happened at Vyronos Street, Patras, where a large semi circular building was constructed over an earlier bath complex (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B4, 539-41) and at Thouria, where a Late Antique wine press was constructed on top of a Doric temple dedicated to Asklepios and Hygeia (ID3314). There are also Christian graves in the same area (ID2565). In other cases, a zone might change function, for example from domestic to industrial. As noted above, industrial complexes are commonly inserted into older domestic buildings, such as at Melos (ID3240) (Fig. 151) and Katapola, Amorgos (1D3252). Reuse of other buildings as foundations for Late Antique churches is common, and is found at Messene, with the construction of the church with mosaics on the monopteros (ID1499) (Fig. 155). It is worth noting that while there is some reuse of temples for churches, it is argued elsewhere (Sweetman [2010]) that this was a later part of the Christianization process. Late Antique churches The discovery of a new Late Antique church is always exciting, particularly since many areas such as Crete and the Peloponnese have seen extensive excavations of churches. Churches outside of these areas, for example in the Cyclades (Keros, Amorgos and Siphnos noted above), add to those recently uncovered at Katapola, Amorgos (AR 56 [2009-2010] 164). In mainland Greece, a church was discovered in the village of Makedonika, Atalanti in 2003. Excavations exposed the layer of the collapsed roof, but no further work was undertaken at that time. The plan of the church was clear in that it had three aisles, a semi-circular apse, a porch to the south and a narthex on the west (ID3489). In 2008 the fortress at Velika, Larisa was cleaned, which included the cleaning of a Late Antique church (ID1356) (Fig. 156). The University of Thessaly continues work on the basilica and the area has been identified as ancient Meliboia. At Korytiani, Epirus, work has continued on the Christian basilica excavated in 2000 (ID1690) (Fig. 157) with a focus on the associated burials (two of which contained Late Antique glass lachrymateria). Close to this area, another Late Antique rectangular building with a stone paved floor has been excavated (ID3269). Also in Epirus, at Doliana, Agios Georgios, work on the excavation of the Christian basilica at Opagia Kalama has continued, with a focus on exposing the mosaics. The mosaics contain geometric motifs, kantharoi with vines flowing out and a scene of fishermen in a river with birds and fish, as well as personifications of the sea. A six-line mosaic inscription had been uncovered in earlier excava tions (ID1693). The mosaics have been consolidated and lifted (ID3204). In western Macedonia, an extensive programme of work is being undertaken on Late Antique churches and buildings in the city identified as Diocletianoupolis in the outskirts of Argos Orestikon (ID3080, ID3079, ID3078; 156.

Argos Orestikon, Paravela: plan of the excavated site. © University of Ioannina/University of Western Greece. http://argosorestikonproject.org/el/) (Fig. 158). The ancient city was moved by Justinian to the site of modern Kastoria. This is a fascinating project and has been adding significantly to the understanding of Late Antique northern Greece. In the Argolid, a Late Antique single-roomed church was discovered in 2004 in the area of Thyni, near Kranidi. The earlier of the two phases consisted of a small building (4.7 by 3.5m) with an apse but no narthex. The excavators believe that this is one of the earliest indica tions of the spread of Christianity into the peninsula. The second church was larger (9.5 by 4.7m) with a larger apse and a narthex. Associated burials have also been excavated (ID3850). Conclusions This broad view of the recent evidence for Late Antique Greece has shown how gaps in the data for the period are being filled, both in terms of types of material and areas of Greece. The material coming to light is also providing insights into the potential for continued and future studies. It is clear that there is significant complexity in the process that weaves change and continuity with the widespread adoption of Christianity. For some, there may have been little perceptible change in most if not all aspects of their lives (from living to dying), while for others areas of their lives may have changed radically (new religion, new city topography). Some people may have experienced change in only certain areas. The growing body of evidence and research suggests that there needs to be a certain fluidity and allowance for a range of different situations across the region. In all, with the wider range of data and an increased interest in Late Antique Greece, a broader range of issues is being addressed, such as relationships between landscapes (urban and rural, sacred and profane) and networks of communication on a range of levels (personal to organizational). These have the potential to clarify this period, without losing sight of the diversity of the area. References Avraméa, A.
