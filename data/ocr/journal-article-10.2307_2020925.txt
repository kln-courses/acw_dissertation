<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREFACE TO A PROOF WHEN I think of my very dear friend, William Pepperell Montague, I think of his small book, Belief Unbound. To my mind it is the best of his writings, full of the special Pepperell Montague brand of insight, unassuming wisdom, and affection. It is a rare work of genius. Some day it will be re-discovered- or, perhaps more accurately, discovered. He subtitled it: "A Promethean Religion for a Modern World." I remember, when it was published by the Yale Press in 1930, that the subtitle seemed at the very outset to damn the book. For in those sceptical years, creating a religion was not thought to be a philosopher's proper business-nor even, some would have said, was practicing a religion. To evaluate and criticize-to be a philosopher of religion-that was quite all right. One would then discretely stand apart, be a "spectator." In Belief Unbound, Pepperell Montague set out to do more than that. Deeply and passionately, he was out to find something; something that many honest thinkers, in those days, seemed to have lost. Through the newly burgeoning sciences, the universe had become so vastly transformed that no one who was scientifically alert could any longer be comfortable with the traditional religions. Even to the least sophisticated, it began to be clear that the physics and ethics of these religions had been shaped in the centuries of man 's abysmal ignorance and that their doctrines had been little more than ignorant hypotheses prematurely fixated into sacred truths. Montague knew this; yet he was not willing to make a com- plete surrender of all that these hypotheses contained. "O.K.," he said in effect, "the universe isn't sitting up nights worrying about us. But where, now, do we go from here? "</page><page sequence="2">PREFACE TO A PROOF 625 Because he had learned to think with the wide sweep of the scientist, he had no hesitation in dropping out the supernaturalisms of magic and of anthropomorphism. But he did not thereupon take what to him was the defeatist step fashionable in those years. If there is no God in the heavens-so the thought then ran-there is at least man on this earth; and man on this earth can create triumphs for himself that can mitigate if they cannot prevent his cosmic doom. Those were the days when we liked to quote Arnold 's definition of religion as "morality touched with emotion." To many of us, this looked like a right and brave way of ad- justing to disagreeable cosmic facts. Montague could not make that kind of adjustment, for it did not answer his passionate question: "Must we believe that the things we care for most are at the mercy of the things we care for least?" Is the existence "of all that is beautiful and in any sense good . . . but the ac- cidental and ineffective by-product of blindly swirling atoms, or of equally unpurposeful, though more conceptually compli- cated, mechanisms of present-day physics? A man may well believe that this dreadful thing is true. But only the fool will say in his heart that he is glad that it is true. " This new kind of fool's gladness, however, was the curious- one might almost say pathological-kind of joy that had developed in those years. Honest thinkers seemed to delight in declaring that the universe, so far as they were concerned, was a sell-out. A kind of cosmic masochism had become de rigueur. Men pointed with metaphysical pride to their own ultimate frustration. To most of us, therefore, it must have seemed incredibly naive when, like a sorrowing child, Montague wrote in his book: "If life and its fulfillments are good, why should anyone rejoice at the news that God is dead and that there is nothing in the whole world except our frail and perishable selves that is concerned with any- thing that matters?" In spite of raised eyebrows, Montague went on to ask: "Is there a power greater than ourselves in the universe that makes for goodness? " Such a power would inevitably have to be something akin to what we have come to know as mind. What place of importance, he went on to ask, has mind in the universe? Like a modern Descartes, he began with himself. The evidence was meager, he had to admit, but it was evidence none the less. "That at least one form of matter is most intimately involved with mind we know by the incontrovertible evidence of our own experience. If no other matter in the universe has mind, at least the matter com- posing human brains does certainly possess it." In other words,</page><page sequence="3">626 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY man, in his own mind, could at least tap one pin-point of the secret ways of the universe. Did this mean, however, that mind was found only where the peculiar configurations we call the human brain are found?e Montague thought not. While the stuff of our brains was dif- ferent from other stuff, it was not so very different. "It is made of the same sort of atoms which are subject to the same laws as are found in matter generally. The organization of the stuff is, to be sure, markedly different from inorganic organizations, and markedly more intricate than those found in lower forms of life." These differences, however, to him were negligible com- pared with the "infinite and absolute difference between conscious and non-conscious being. " Then he uttered the great heresy. "To suppose that a mere rearrangement of the same chemical atoms could create out of nothing a whole new dimension of reality, such as feeling or consciousness, seems to me beyond the limits of pos- sibility. If sentience is based on matter it cannot be based merely upon some special distribution of its particles, it must rather be intrinsic to material being as such." So Montague launched his panpsychic postulate: mind is "in- trinsic to material being as such." What followed in his book was no calculated and detailed proof of a cosmic mind. It was merely, as he himself suggested, a "preface to such a proof." It is this preface to the panpsychic proof that makes this small book stand out with a peculiar brilliance. In the first place, it was a daring thing to do (who, to-day, would readily avow him- self a panpsychist?). In the second place, it opened up a way of approach to the mystery of mind in Nature that had scarcely as yet been explored. The approach, as Montague 's readers will remember, was through an analysis of the two kinds of being that every existent thing possesses. "Every existent thing possesses two kinds of being, 'actual' and 'potential.' Its actual being is what it overtly is at any given place in any given instant. . . . Its potential being is private or internal, and not capable of appearing externally." A careless reader might have said: "So what?" A careful reader would have seen that Montague was using the clue he had found in his own mind (which was an "inside" to himself but an "outside" to everyone else) and extending it to the countless beings of the universe. Everywhere there is externality, outside- ness-in a blade of grass, a tree, a stone, a rabbit, another human being, a mountain, a star. Might there not then in all these be an internality, an insideness as well? Would this not, Montague suggested, give us a kind of clue</page><page sequence="4">PREFACE TO A PROOF 627 that would make the cosmos more understandably alive? In every "actuality" around us there is also "potentiality"; in every "out- side'" an "'inside'"; in every "'visible'" an "'invisible. " Might it not be that the plight we are in is merely that for the most part we cannot penetrate to the interiors? Happily we are on the "inside" of ourselves. We know what goes on. More or less roughly, we can infer what goes on in the insideness of those other human beings who are similar to ourselves. But to all other "in- sidenesses" of existence we have no way of entrance. Montague proved nothing-nor made a pretense of it. But in his small book, with its unusual analysis of the "actual" and the "potential," he suggests far more than could be put into the convincing sequences of logic. His panpsychism-or better, his feeling of a cosmos alive and full of mind-remains a work of creative imagination. If it is indeed only a preface to a proof, it is one that needs reading in a time like our own when the cosmos has paled into a distant insolubility. All this about a cosmic mind, Montague would have been the first to say, may be sheer nonsense. It would be good if a universe of life and consciousness were real. But it may be quite unreal. It may in fact be nothing more than "a revival of ancient empty hope masking its emptiness in phrases." "To this," he wrote, "we can only reply: Perhaps you are right, but there is a chance that you are not. There is at least a chance that there is an upward- trending power in nature . . . a chance that the cosmos as a whole has a unitary life and consciousness and that the evolutionary nisus is its will which, though not omnipotent, is omnipresent." Religion, to Pepperell Montague, was the acceptance neither of a primitive absurdity nor of a sophisticated truism. It was the acceptance, rather, of what he called a "momentous possibility." This was the possibility that "what is highest in spirit is also deepest in nature, that the ideal and the real are at least to some extent identified, not merely evanescently in our own lives but enduringly in the universe itself." If this possibility were an actuality, he felt, "if there truly were at the heart of nature something akin to us, a conserver and increaser of values, and if we could not only know this and act upon it, but really feel it, life would suddenly become radiant. For no longer should we be alien accidents in an indifferent world, uncharacteristic by-products of the blindly whirling atoms; and no longer would the things that matter most be at the mercy of the things that matter least." There was a chance, he felt. This was Pepperell Montague's happy gamble with the cosmos. H. A. OVERSTREET</page></plain_text>
