Still photography plays an ancillary role (if it plays a role at all) in today's anthropology. It provides a means to create visual records that serve to illustrate words. Photography is seldom the major focus, an end in itself where words serve to place pictures. Or, at those times when photography dominates, it is always in film and video. The great majority of attention within the subfield of visual anthropology is devoted to film. This review poses the possibility of a more central place for still photography. Can one speak of an ethnophotography, where photography means still photography? I pose the possibility; I hardly settle it. I come to the topic out of a personal and longstanding devotion to still American Ethnologist 21(4):867-885.

For me, photography came first, anthropology came later as an inheritance. I develop the discussion by reviewing four studies, each representing a different point in the discussion. Two are collections of essays having to do with the interplay of anthropology and photography, and two, which serve as pylons around which to turn our argument, are about photography alone. A photograph is at once a direct representation of reality and the result of an utterly subjective choice. Any discussion of photography must take into account both sides of this coin. With photography, we have a "real," but meaningless "there," an objective relation between an object and light-sensitive film mediated by a lens. The objective contingency joins with the subjective choice made by the photographer, a subjectivity all the more striking because of the underlining objective "there" of the photograph. Any photograph, especially a good photo- graph, always combines reality and subjectivity. It is a mix of information (it "bears witness"), of ideology, of emotion, and of aesthetics. The reality of a photograph was insisted upon by Charles Peirce when he classified a photograph as an "index" rather than an "icon" or "image." Thus: Photographs, especially instantaneous photographs, are very instructive, because we know that they are in certain respects exactly like the objects they represent. But this resemblance is due to the photographs having been produced under such circumstances that they were physically forced to correspond point by point to nature. In that aspect, then, they belong to the second class of signs [indices], those by physical connection. [1955:106] The dualism of photography underlies much of the discussion in the excellently edited Anthropology and Photography. In the period covered by the book, from 1860 until the years just prior to Malinowski's major fieldwork, anthropology was concerned with observable facts. It welcomed photography as a means for objectively recording these facts, be they facts about physical type, material culture, or techniques, or records of specific events. Anthropologists naively accepted the potential of a camera to record reality and ignored, or mostly ignored, the subjectivity of the photographer/anthropologist's decisions regarding what "reality" was to be recorded and how and when to record it. Looking back with our modern sensibilities, the subjectivity of the photographs shows itself with blatant vigor: the patronizing authority of colonial superiority, the other as object to be measured against grids, the other to be typified, the other as curio, the undressed female other as the object of male fantasy, the other reduced to stereotypes, the brutish cannibal, the noble savage, whatever. But the legacy also has photographs, subjective or not, of great documentary and historical value. And there are others yet that display remarkable understanding and warmth for the people they show. And, finally, Anthropology and Photography, gives us at least one ethnophotographer hero, Everard im Thurn. El izabeth Edwards, the editor of Anthropology and Photography, describes the volume as an "exercise in source criticism" where the selection reflects the "relationship between the photographer and the photographed and the creation and consumption of images" (p. 4). The aim of the book is to explore "ways to look into photographs and through them into culture" (p. 14). The book draws the bulk of its photographs for discussion from the archives of the Royal Anthropological Institute (RAI) with others added for broader coverage and is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to general issues and the second part to specific cases. In part one, after the introduction, Terence Wright speaks of the problem of real ity and the old equation of the camera equals the eyeball: eyeball is a little camera. Actually, photography is "a rather special mode of perception" and different from human vision, as modern optics has been able to show. Beyond Wright's paper, I might add that 19th-century photographers were not oblivious to the differences. Two positions should be mentioned (Crawford 1979:56-61, 79-83). Peter Henry Emerson wanted the camera to follow the eye, which is highly selective. He proposed a "naturalistic photography" where the central focus in the mid-distance is 868 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">relatively sharp while the rest is left blurred. His marvelous photographs, many of great ethnographic value, illustrate his theory, especially those taken in East Anglia (N. Newhall 1975). In contrast, Henry Peach Robinson argued that the eye is never stationary, seldom stares. Instead, it constantly scans the view keeping everything in focus. Such a position supported his composite photographs where one photograph was made up of many separate photographs. Following what Wright tells us, Robinson seemed to be closerto modern optics, a distinct irony considering the silliness of his photographs-for example, his frequently reproduced "Fading Away," an acted-out tableau of a five-photo composite showing a family attending the last hours of a young girl (B. Newhall 1982:76).1 In a useful paper, Joanna Scherer offers a practical hermeneutic for critically reading and interpreting historic photographs as primary anthropological data. Any analysis must take into account the photograph itself, the viewer's interpretation of the subject of the photograph, and the photographer's intention. With historic photographs, it is essential to separate the contem- porary from the modern viewer's interpretation. Properly attended to, any photograph can serve a whole range of important documentary ends. Roslyn Poignant reviews the contents of the RAI photographic collection to show how it shadows the history of 19th-century Victorian to early-20th-century British anthropology as it was initially "struggling to institutionalize itself." She notes the move from a confident embrace to a "more restrained employment of photography." Several authors comment on the shift and explain it as resulting both from an increased skepticism about the "factual" and measurable utility of photographs, especially in physical anthropology (compare Spencer's contribution) and to a change in subject matter from an observable world to the more abstract notions of social structure, and so forth. Of course, not all colonial photographs of ethnographic importance reached the RAI collection. Some are conspicuous by their absence. Poignant gives a good example (developed further in Rae-Ellis's paper, compare plates 143-145) of Trucanini, the "last Tasmanian." Framed official photographs by C. A. Woolley showing her as a "specimen" are in the collection but not the informal photographs of Bishop Nixon that convey "a sense of the Tasmanians individuality and something of their human predicament" (p. 46). The collection displays throughout, and especially in its earlier period, a preference for a scientific over a humanitarian anthropology. Christopher Pinney takes the indexical/subjective sides of a photograph and lays out two "histories" of photography. The first expresses the confidence of photographic reality while the second shows photography as less secure in the indexical truth (Pinney substitutes truth for reality) of its claims. For the second history, he starts by mentioning retouching and other manipulations whose purpose is to guarantee the depth of the truth (whatever that is). There are also photographs like those discovered by C. G. Seligman of the Veddas depicted as the "wild men of Ceylon," which hardly matched the Veddas Seligman subsequently encountered in the field. Thus, we have photographs that either do not match experience or that are fixed up to suit it. It all looks suspicious. Of greater concern to Pinney is the singularity of a photograph: a single photograph is indeterminate. Without supporting props, it cannot be placed and hence accepted as valid. A photograph of six white men standing in a row (plate 56) might, taken by itself, be placed with a photograph of five black men also standing in the row (plate 55). A comparison of physical types? Without captions, we do not know that the former is of unemployed North Texans taken in 1937 by Dorothea Lange and the latter of African chiefs taken by Major A. J. N. Tremearne in the early years of this century. The absence of shown context compares to film, where "the context and closure provided by syntagmatic concatenation [are] the great rationale for ethnographic film." In contrast, Pinney tells us, still photography has only "the truncated and castrated 'fetish' of the photo- on fixing ethnographic shadows 869</page><page sequence="4">graphic 'look'." In sum, citing Marilyn Strathern, he states "film . .. plays Malinowski to still photography's Frazer" (p. 90). This take on still photography is silly. Pinney seems out of touch with the communicative power of photography. For a start, Pinney, an Englishman, might take his metaphors "truncated and castrated 'fetish' " and "Frazer" and run them by Chris Killip's In Flagrante (1988, excerpted in Aperture 103, 1986), a photo essay about Northern England around the time of the 1985 coal strike during the Thatcher years. He could then find out how helpful the metaphors are (how "they bring new knowledge"). He might begin with the haunting photo of "Helen and her hoola hoop." More generally, we perceive film and photographs in different ways. Although the former derives from the latter, each is phenomenologically distinct. The difference is best described by Roland Barthes: "in front of the screen, I am not free to shut my eyes; otherwise, opening them again, I would not discover the same image; I am constrained to a continuous voracity; a host of other qualities, but not pensiveness; whence the interest, for me, of the photogram" (1981:55; compare also pp. 78 and 89). The same thought occurred to 14-year-old Pamela who told Janine Niepce, a French photojournalist, "I like to stay with people for as long as I wish, in film they go away" (Niepce 1992). An isolated still photograph lacks a context, usually. A photograph, outside of a portrait, however, is never intended to be picked up at random out of the context of display or group or caption. Photographs go together. They are meant to be seen together. Although ordered in a book or on the wall or in a stack, we can rearrange the order, sort the stack, flip from one page to another, move the eye from this wall to that, skipping this picture in favor of another. By making different arrangements, we experiment with the varying implications of an overall context. At any time the viewer can, as Barthes emphasizes, look at and think about a single photograph. In contrast, film imposes a rigid context, a "syntagmatic concatenation" determined by the film editor's assembled sequence. We are stuck with what we are given. And we cannot rearrange anything to suit our curiosity. We certainly cannot take a careful look at any one image in particular. The differences between film and stills are important to understand. There is little point in dismissing the latter because of the former. Why displace one form of perception and communication for another? The case studies are too numerous and too individually inviting to review in their entirety. I can only list some highlights and reserve greater comment to three papers where the photog- raphers themselves are the main focus of attention. Throughout, we must admire each writer's ability to place individual photographs in an appropriate historical context, something that would be impossible without their considerable knowledge of particular histories and ethnog- raphies. Old photographs provide crucial documentation, and Margaret Blackman gives fine exam- ples. Architectural and village photographs among the Haida taken by George Dawson in the 1870s, and slightly later by Robert Reford, establish the absolute baseline for the modern study of Haida architecture (plates 89-92). In addition, photographs can present puzzles to challenge an enthnographer's expertise. A photograph of what looks like worship of the tooth relic at the Dalada Maligava in Kandy turns out to be something rather different (plate 98). H. L. Seneviratne notes that the actual tooth relic would never be shown in this manner and that the officiating monks, in the background, are casually dressed. He infers that the worshipers are Burmese pilgrims and that the relic is a replica. The photograph shows the historical asymmetry between the Kandy priests and the Burmese pilgrims. In 1909, Edgar Thurston published a photograph of a Hindu religious figure captioned as a Jangam ascetic (plate 110). However, Nicholas Bradford tells us that it is a photograph of a Puravantaru, a charismatic form of Shiva that was popular in rural pantheons. Why the error? Bradford concludes that the subject of the photograph misinformed Thurston as a way to improve his own religious status. In other examples, we find that sometimes a single photograph can resolve a debate. Who was in the picture helps Gwyn Prins clinch an argument about the push and pull of power between 870 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">Europeans and the Lozi nation at the end of the century. Did King Lewanika sell outto the British South Africa Company at the expense of his people or was his move based on their support? One recently discovered photograph taken a few moments before signing the agreement with the British points conclusively to the latter, for pictured are two high officials seated next to the king as their rank required (plate 141 ii). If he had been selling out, the two officials, most definitely, would not have been present. A photograph can contain a "hidden history," a theme that appears from time to time in the collection. A single photograph, taken about 1885, of a Maori meeting house captures three young women standing by carved uprights. The house looks on the surface to be dilapidated and falling into ruins (plate 142). Anne Salmond's examination, however, shows us that the house had and continues to have a complex history. "Apparent ruins," Salmond's analysis shows us, "may be a prelude to rebuilding" (p. 229). Was caste occupationally or racially determined? Pinney explains how the two sides of this now defunct debate were argued by way of pictures. Paul Hockings counts 20 plates in W. H. R. Rivers's The Todas(l 906)that depict the same scene: a shadowy figure in the middle distance, in the background a dairy temple and a grove of deciduous trees with branches spreading to the ground (plates 112-113). Was Rivers implying with pictures, but never in words, the connection between the Todas and the temple of Nemi that provided the leitmotif for Frazer's Golden Bough? Rivers was a staunch empiricist, but he had, quoting George Stocking, "an uninhibited explanatory imagination" (p. 181). A set of exceptionally mediocre snapshots taken in Nubia by F. S. G. Whitfield of visiting colonial officials and "native" spear throwing and wrestling (plates 132-137) sets James Faris on a tirade about camera's power to control. That unmitigated colonial power was present is obvious, but it was not defined nor enforced down the bellows of a Kodak, surely. Faris takes the camera-equals-gun simile too seriously. The Ethiopian elite were quick to realize the political usefulness of photography. Richard Pankhurst describes how publicly displayed photographs of Lij lyasu, Emperor Menlik's heir, both helped and hindered his career. Jan Vansina brings his consummate knowledge of the Kuba to photographs taken on the Emil Torday and M. W. Hilton Simpson expedition of 1907-09, which took place at a time when the Compagnie du Kasai, a rubber gathering and trading company, was being accused of labor atrocities. The photographs showed none of the conflict, indirectly serving as a "public relations effort for the C.K. and the colonial Congo Government" (p. 193). They also contributed to various and contrasting European stereotypes of the ignorant and superstitious Africans, the gullible African, and the romantic dancing African. Vansina ends with a pair of photographs. The first promotes romance (plate 127). It is an insipid "body beautiful" shot of a drum band, which Vansina tells us was utterly faked, having nothing to do with Kasai drumming. But the contrasting photo (plate 128) is authentic, indeed, a photo of Sam, one of the expedition's servants, a boy decked out in European garb with a plumed Panama hat and smoking a cigar. Such followers of the Europeans were destined to become the elite of Kasai. "The future did not belong to the masked kings-it belonged to the Sams" (p. 205). The same M. W. Hilton Simpson who worked in the Congo also visited the Aures Massif of Eastern Algeria. In reviewing his work, the late Naziha Hamouda reported that his photographs of two women dancers revealed their personality and showed his admiration for them (p. 210). For once, a colonial photographer, photographing the female "other," resists colonial fantasies. We know George Hunt today as Franz Boas's principal Kwakiutl consultant. He was also a photographer. Ira Jacknis outlines his photographic career both when he worked on his own and as an assistant to others, including Edward Curtis, of whom he was critical. Hunt's preferred topics had to do with human activity, especially ceremonialism. Jacknis examines, in particular, photographs of a potlatch, of a shaman at work, and of Hamatsa initiates (plates 93-97). Hunt on fixing ethnographic shadows 871</page><page sequence="6">had access to situations that were not available to outsiders. For that reason alone, the collection of surviving photographs is of the utmost value. A large part of the Native American photographic record consists of portraits of famous chiefs who had fought against the white man. Brian Dippie shows that the photographs projected stereotypes having the chiefs, often with various weapons and usually in some form of traditional dress, in set poses not dissimilar from those of classical statuary. The expressions on the chiefs' faces showed resigned stoicism and dignity and, at times, annoyance and ill ease. In unpacking the stereotype of Native American portraiture where subjects are stoic survivors of the vanishing races, Dippie and others run the risk of packing up a stereotype of their own, the photographer.2 Who were W. H. Jackson (plates 84-85, 88) and F. A. Rinehart (plate 83)? Were they identical peas from one pod? What of Alexander Gardner, whose portrait of Big Mouth Hawk (plate 1) appears in Edwards's introduction? In the well-made photographs, despite the conventional pose and attire that offend Dippie, strong individual personalities show out across the years. Were the subjects all that displeased with their images? Consider an anecdote. Gertrude Kasebier, a contemporary of Alfred Stieglitz, took portraits of Native Americans in her New York studio (Michaels 1992:30-44). She was determined to show them as people and was remarkably successful. However, she got into trouble with Iron Tail, an elderly chief, by photographing him in ordinary attire. On receiving the photograph, he tore it in two. Hearing of his displeasure, Kasebier retook the photograph, this time with the chief in striking profile and in full ceremonial regalia. Chief Iron Tail was satisfied. Is this a form of false consciousness? Are the Native Americans' descendants ill served bythe portraits? If Big Mouth Hawk had been my great-grand- father, I know Gardner's formal portrait would take pride of place in my home. Let me speak at greater length about three of the papers where the photographers and their relationship to their subjects is the major focus. These studies are important for anyone concerned with a modern practice of photography in the field. What was the photographer trying to do and what was the rapport between photographer and subject? We can learn from their examples. In perhaps the most nuanced paper in the collection, Elizabeth Edwards discusses colonial styles in photographing the Andamanese. She brings together the evolving relationships between the British and Andamanese and sets them against various approaches to anthropo- logical photography, especially the dichotomy of scientific and casual photographs. E. H. Man, a colonial officer, was involved with running the "Andaman Homes," a mecha- nism for inducing the Andamanese to give up their nomadic existence. Throughout his 30-year career, Man made continuous contributions to Andamanese ethnography. He also took photographs that he conceived of as scientific records based on formulae set out in Notes and Queries. The photographs are stiff and lifeless. He took the anthropomorphic photographs common to the period and photographs illustrating gestures and particular activities. All are "carefully posed images to complement his observations" (p. 109). In one, the Andamanese are shooting, sleeping, dancing, and greeting all in a single photograph (plate 67). Another (plate 70) shows them playing instruments, recording exactly how the instruments were held, but "recording none of the essential spirit of music making" (p. 110). Man's more spontaneous photographs came in totally nonscientific contexts, especially when he photographed the physical environment and settlement buildings. He took one photograph (plate 73) that reveals something of an interpersonal relationship. The photograph pictures a tense group of Europeans together with Andamanese from an outlying island, away from the "Andaman Homes." The purpose of the photograph was to bear witness to an event and not to record scientific data. In marked contrast to Man's photography was that of G. Dobson, a zoologist, who had no interest in scientific anthropology. He made photographs on only one occasion in 1872, and his casual approach better revealed "the reality of Andamanese experience" (p. 115). The 872 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">photograph shown by Edwards (plate 72) has become a classic, often displayed, most recently betwixt a Stieglitz and a Clement (or may be referring to Thomas?) Cooper on British television. It is a relaxed photograph of the Chief of Rutland and his wife. Several versions of the photograph exist: the original, one vignetted after the portrait fashion of the time, and one fixed up for publication in a scientific journal where grass has been scratched in to cover the chief's genitals, although his wife's breasts are left as is. Later photographers fit between Man and Dobson. M. V. Portman (plate 74) in the 1890's followed Man's scientific goals but was more sensitive to his subjects' views. He revealed "a directness, a concentrated observation" (p. 117). In the 1900s, other photographers (plates 75-77) recorded more spontaneous situations. Their advantage was that by then the An- damanese were familiar (if not satisfied) with the British. Looking at Man's photographs, Edwards seems to regret that he remained so steadfast in his devotion to scientific recording. Man spent years with the Andamanese, spoke one of their languages, and had many opportunities to fix photographically the evolution of their world in contact with the British. That he chose not to is anthropology's loss. Man's and Dobson's photographs representtwo opposites in the photography ofthe time. The strictly anthropological and scientific photographs were "visually constrained." The photographs that worked, that are revealing, turn outto be the casual photographs, very often (though not in Dobson's case) simple snapshots. The scientific ideals of recording people and their activities blocked out the camera's ability to reveal the subject's individuality and expressiveness and to catch the physical and social ambiance. More to the point, the scientific photographs deflect away from the subject and turn onto themselves. They tell us first and foremost that "this is a scientific photograph." Ironically, several authors in Anthropology and Photography imply the same when they talk about art photographs. They see the art as obliterating the subject making art and scientific photographs equivalent in this regard. Both are opaque and obscure the subject. Consider the next paper. Martha Macintyre and Maureen MacKenzie contrast three photographers covering the same spot in Papua New Guinea. The paper places art where Edwards placed science, as it describes how different photographers approached the same subjects in such different ways. R. M. Williamson, an amateur photographer, made a brief visit to Papua to see "something of savage life" (p. 159). He took many shots, most of which (as the one shown [plate 99]) were taken from a distance. They were of large spaces, well framed but taken from an outsider's point of view, away from the hubbub of everyday life. His close-ups reveal his unfamiliarity with the place and his ill ease before people. They are stiff or worse, "a young man glowers or a child gapes as if intimidated or frightened by the stranger behind the camera" (p. 160). Harold Dauncey, a missionary, worked for ten years among the Motuan people. He took many homey, up front, snapshots. Although they show a patronizing superiority, the snaps are unobtrusive and, though inexpertly made, are sympathetic to the subjects and revealing of their common everyday life. His photographs provide an excellent visual record. Finally, F. W. Barton, an administrator with "a passion for photography" took many photo- graphs over a period of years under the rubric of ethnography. His work troubles Macintyre and MacKenzie because they sense his preoccupation with the art of photography: his subjects were objects for the practice of art. His concerns, they tell us, are with European high art fashions. What fashions? We do not learn. Perhaps it was Henry Emerson's naturalist photography (my guess from the two examples). Macintyre and MacKenzie much prefer Dauncey's awkward records to Barton's "art." To make their point, they set side by side photos of the same subject one by Dauncey (plate 100) and one by Barton (plate 101): a girl grooming the hair of another girl. To Macintyre and MacKenzie, the Dauncey photo is ethnographically more apt because it is placed within a living space, perhaps a courtyard. It is also photographically inept, given a leg hanging down in the on fixing ethnographic shadows 873</page><page sequence="8">background and an inopportune shadow in the foreground. In contrast, Barton's isolates the girls with a soft, indistinct background. The effect of the latter, to Macintyre and MacKenzie, is more "art" than ethnography. One can spot the strength of Barton's photo. He shows the groomed girl in quarter not full profile. The groomer, though in profile, has sufficient light to show her nose. We see both faces clearly. Moreover, the photo is from a low angle. This arrangement brings our eye up, tying the girls together by way of the groomer's arm. We see, hence feel, the ensemble. The absence of a distinct background hardly disturbs the point: the conviviality of grooming. The grooming picture ill serves Macintyre and MacKenzie's argument. More useful are photographs Barton made, underthe pretext of ethnographic reporting, of the abdominal tattoos of pubescent girls. They were mainly colonial soft porn, "exotic sexuality and tropical fantasy" (p. 162), which ran directly counter to Papuan sense of propriety. Macintyre and MacKenzie show one of these photographs, and here there is a surprise (plate 102). A Motu girl dressed only with abdominal tattoos and a necklace poles a canoe bearing down directly on the camera. The angle is low; where is Barton, in the water?! Macintyre and MacKenzie call this photo a realization of his fantasy, yet perceptively add, "she gazes directly back into the central eye of the lens. Her stare denies the possibility of her being taken as a sexual object; she meets him and us on an equal footing" (p. 163). The serendipity of an obsessive colonial encountering a Papuan Olympia provides us with a memorable photograph. It proves, one more time, that fine photographs (and I am not talking of art, but of photography) can pop up in the most surprising places and circumstances. I am perplexed that Macintyre and MacKenzie seem to think that good photography necessitates bad ethnography. The bad guys are the good photographers! Taken to its extreme, their opinion about Barton's art is strikingly similar to Edwards's demonstration of E. H. Man's science. Barton is obsessed with European art styles and his sexual fantasies, just as Man is obsessed with his scientific recording. Unfortunately, we do not see enough of Barton's photographs to judge. To the contrary, of the two shown, one is perfectly adequate and the other is exceptional. Actually, an aesthetic, an art, within the still photography of people, is not to be found in "high art styles" of any period. Rather, in Henri Cartier-Bresson's succinct words, it is found in "a mixture of emotion and geometry, together in a single instant" (1992:45), with "instant" determined by the technology of the time. This geometry and emotion can appear in even the most modest of snaps. A subject, an expression, and a frame work together to catch our attention and to draw us into the photograph. A deceptively simple example appears in Edwards's introduction with Dr. Stone's 1925 "Swampy Cree people at Cross Lake" (plate 6). It is a relaxed and inviting family group. The boy in the right background with the flat cap, the girl in the center front with her finger touching her mouth, and the woman with the rabbit skin shawl on the left organize the picture. The cheerful demeanor of the group and the formal arrangement bring it to life. We are there. One might contrast the photograph with Major Tremearne's 1912 "Kajji chiefs" (plate 55), which merely shows five men lined up in a row. All said, however, I appreciate Macintyre and MacKenzie's discussion. They respond directly to photographs. They look at the photographs before they "look into ... and through" them. It is a shame that their paper has so few photos to look at. We want to see more of Dauncy snaps, Williamson's ill-at-ease portraits, and Barton's soft porn. This leads to my one serious complaint about the editing. The photographs, which are utterly crucial to the book, are ill distributed between the papers. Papers with many photographs (one with 25) could do with a lot fewer, while others, like Macintyre and MacKenzie's paper, cry out for more. Finally, we are delighted, in fact relieved, when Donald Tayler introduces us to Everard im Thurn, a botanist, a colonial officer, and an ethnographer who practiced what we might today identify as a viable ethnophotography. Im Thurn traveled widely in Guyana (then British 874 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">Guiana). He came to know many Native Americans, approaching them often for their botanical knowledge. As an anthropologist, his "lasting contact with the Indians bears little if any relation to the master-servant hierarchical necessities of colonialism" (p. 187). During his second stay, he took numerous photographs that, with a few exceptions, were taken under "natural conditions" with no manipulation and with obvious sympathy for his subjects. He saw his own work as the antithesis to common practice, which he considered "dehumanized and objecti- fied." The 49 photographs by im Thurn in the RAI collection were used to illustrate a lecture and, hence, are quite selective. Tayler discusses three of the pictures (plates 117-119). The first is of a father with two sons whose wariness in face of the intrusive camera draws our sympathy. It is an intense and intimate portrait. The second is a spontaneous shot of three men on what looks like a log. They study a river's course. Entitled "Which Way down the Falls?" it is a fine composition. Tayler calls it "Rodinesque"; I call it good photography. Two men are standing, and one is crouching; the tipsy situation reveals their body kinesics. The third is a portrait of a man named Lonk. Although it was taken to show how a necklace is worn, it also shows a relaxed model who was obviously comfortable in im Thurn's company. Here is Cartier-Bresson's geometry and emotion at work. I can only add that I hope Mr. Tayler finds a way to publish im Thurn's entire set of photographs. It would make an important contribution to the histories of both anthropology and photography. The col lection concludes with a dour afterword entitled "Framed Photographs." In it, Iskander Mydin speaks ominously of pernicious coffee-table books, while James Faris produces a post-something "political" screed. The best I can make of Faris's "rant" (as Jane Austen would have called it) is that, in today's world, we should all either turn in, or turn over to others, our ethnographic cameras. If Faris wishes to get rid of his Nikon, so be it. I for one will hold onto my two battered but beloved Leicas. It is an odd ending to an otherwise splendid book. Anthropology and Photography leaves us with im Thurn and casual photographs as guides to the practice of ethnophotography. Most everything else cautions us on what not to do. We are looking for more. A step in our direction is the special issue of L'Ethnographie devoted to still photography. The occasion leading to the issue's publication was an exhibit at the Musee Nicephore Niepce (named after the inventor of photography) of Claude Levi-Strauss's still photographs taken, mainly in South America, during the 1930s. At the same time, the photographer, Jean-Marc Zaorski, joined by Emmanuel Garrigues, organized the 1989 meeting of the Gens d'lmages on the topic of the relationship of photography to ethnography. Ethnographie etphotographie can best be read as Emmanuel Garriques's personal quest for an ethnophotography. The volume consists of a long introduction by Garriques and essays on the photographic and ethnographic sides of the issue. It is flanked by two interviews conducted by Garriques, first of Levi-Strauss and then of Pierre Verger, who are contemporaries of each other. However, neither interview was very helpful to Garrigues. Further, it is never entirely clear that the contributors, aside from Garriques who writes with unbounded enthusiasm, further ethnophotography or enlarge its role beyond the common ancillary one. Levi-Strauss stresses that he is an ethnographer, not a photographer and "[t]o each his specialty" (p. 76).3 He never made extensive use of photography because he was bothered by its imaginary dimension and its subjectivity. However, he points to Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson's use of photography as an example of photography as a valid tool. Revealing of Levi-Strauss's distancing of photography from his ethnography was his refusal to have photo- graphs by himself and others accompany an exhibition of "Les Ameriques de Claude Levi- Strauss" in 1990 at the Mus6e de I'Homme, "for photographs would detract attention from the objects shown and would have changed the purpose and the tone of the exhibition" (p 76). However, he did not object to having his photographs shown by themselves and apart from the Musee de I'Homme, in a strictly photographic context. on fixing ethnographic shadows 875</page><page sequence="10">Pierre Verger provides Garrigues with a fascinating interview that will be of interest to anyone familiar with his work on African Brazilian religious connections. Verger came to ethnography while working as Alfred Metraux's photographer. He captures the uniqueness of a photogra- pher's practice when he offers advice on how best to proceed, especially when he cautions that "(i)t is not necessary to try to understand, but rather to feel, to remain a simple observer without participating, without trying to penetrate the reason for anything" (p. 167). This is a good start. It is helpful to the quest, especially when Verger agrees with Garrigues about the unconscious factor in photography, that we really do not understand why we snap the shutter at the precise moment we do, or only come to understand later when we study the prints. However, the interview makes an abrupt change when Verger ends by separating photography from ethnog- raphy. He places the separation autobiographically at the time he came to write up his African and Brazilian Orisha material: "At that moment I was lost to photography. That is, I was obliged to write up, I was obliged to try and understand things. My life until then, was relaxed, I did not try to analyze and define what I saw, I got by with my impressions, I pushed the shudder of my Rollieflex from time to time" (p. 174). For Verger, therefore, photography is an intuitive look at the world, while ethnography is a systematic attempt to understand the world. Levi-Strauss and Verger come to identical conclusions. Short essays accompany two sets of photographs. Carmen Bernand's photographs, taken in Peru in the 1960s provide important documentation of aspects of Andean ritual battles. Photographs by Serge Tornay, of the Nilotic Nyangatom of Ethiopia, lead him to argue that ethnophotography entails an ethic "in the service of others" (p. 104). There can be either symbolic images to press a particular human cause or documentary images where a "good ethnophotography is one that informs, instructs, that awakens admiration.... [I]t is one that aids us to better know and therefore better respect others" (p. 104). Andre Rouille, editor of La recherche photographique, in an essay paralleling those of Anthropology and Photography, shows that the objective goals of a certain Moulin, a mid-1 9th-century Parisian photographer, matched the political goals of French Algerian colonialism. From his discussion of sample poses, Rouille draws numerous parallels between ethnography and photography, which he addresses primarily to photographers. The most telling show that photography and ethnography are based on participant observation, at mid-position between the group observed and that of the world of the observer, are intrusive and, hence, are obliged to measure continually the effect of their presence. Rouille notes that, unlike ethnography, where the relationship of an observer to "the other" is a properly addressed problem, the practice of photography, in general, ignores it. The truth of a photograph is understood indirectly as a formal cultural artifact with a history. This, apparently, is news to photographers and to historians and critics of photography. We are left with Emmanuel Garrigues's quest, which he begins in the introduction, by asking a series of general questions about photography and its relationship to ethnography: What does photography bring that is irreplaceable about the knowledge of man? What is the historic relationship between ethnography and photography? What is the status of photography vis-a-vis language, and what is the status of photography as a science? Have scientists done science with photographs? And, he naively asks if a photography can exactly parallel an ethnography. I believe he is led to this question because of the parallel existence of photographers and ethnographers. He observes at varying points in his discussion that photographers, from Lewis Hine to the present, do or did what could be called ethnography. He brings these questions to a number of conclusions. Photography is a visual form of communication that can be put to ethnographic ends. Photography is utterly particularistic, which limits its scientific use in recording data. A photograph does not generalize, though one can make a general verbal statement on the basis of photographic evidence. A photograph has the double nature of the sort that we have been considering throughout this review. He comes to the double point on many occasions confecting each time a charming Gallic phrase to sum 876 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="11">it up, thus: "Indeed, what is this bizarre means of expression that reads you as you are reading it, that is able to accumulate knowledge about the practitioner at the same time as the practitioner uses it to accumulate and record knowledge?" (p. 28). A photograph can be created and read from different angles, which Garrigues calls registers, that range from scientific, to imaginary, to emotional, to aesthetic. A photograph might be created in one register and read in another, as when William Kline makes an aesthetic photograph of May Day in Moscow, and Barthes chooses to read it "as the very raw material of ethnological knowledge [where] I note the boy's big cloth cap, another's necktie, an old woman's scarf around her head, a youth's haircut, etc." (Barthes 1981:29-30). Embedded in the discussion is a photographic historiography similar to that advanced by Edwards and Scherer in Anthropology and Photography and to which he adds a positive twist in reference to Edward Curtis, the maligned photographer of Native Americans: "It is for us to learn how to read and question these photographs rather than to 'attack' the photographer" (p. 38). In speaking of ethnographers as photographers, he reminds us that Malinowski took a great many photographs during his fieldwork and that "the study of his relationship to photography has yet to made" (p. 40).4 Garrigues's specific contribution is to report on a project where he is attempting to put an ethnophotography to work. He has chosen the southern part of the Goutte d'Or quarter of Paris, XVIII, that is undergoing complex changes of rebuilding and development. It also has an important non-French population of considerable ethnic diversity. His intention is to place photography on the same level as ethnography so as to promote an expressive discourse. Conducting the project over a period of years, he instructs his students to take series of photographs on precise topics and to maintain a field journal as they work. A systematic analysis of both forms of observation "allows one to understand a little more fully some fundamental problems, especially those of the other and of identity. [The photos], at one time, provoke reflection, support analyses, are memories, are a means of expression, and are forms of analysis themselves (analyseurs) and many others things besides" (p. 125). The photographs that accompany the article are striking. We look forward to the final published results. Ethnographie et photographie ends with summaries of the photographic collections housed at the Societe de Geographie and the Mus6e de I'Homme, as well as the Brunel Collection of photographs taken in Tunisia in the 1900s. Two independently conceived collections on still photography published close together, one Anglo-American the other French, suggest a renewed interest in doing something about and with still photography,5 although, with the noticeable exception of Emmanuel Garrigues, little appears in either about a current photographic practice. For that, we will have to turn away from anthropology and look directly at photography. "wonderful" Gene Smith I will try to be honest; I don't know if I can be truthful. [Smith, quoted by Maddow 1 985:62] Just that crazy little clic, and that whir, whir. He was forever behind the camera. Very intent. [Jean Pearson in an interview, Hughes 1989:239] W. Eugene Smith's (1918-78) work as a photojournalist became "the standard by which other photographers judged the genre" (Goldberg 1991 [1981]:182). His career can be divided into three major periods: the early work, starting in 1934 and continuing through World War II where Smith reported from the Pacific theater; his work as a staff photographer for Life magazine from 1943 to 1954; and his free-lance photography after his stint at Life until his death in 1978 (Johnson 1981). Smith's work was characterized by intense and palpable feelings for his subjects, subjects that ranged from a single person, such as actress Jean Pearson (Life, November on fixing ethnographic shadows 877</page><page sequence="12">21, 1949) to the entire city of Pittsburgh. In making his reportage, he wanted to enter into the subjects' worlds and lives. He often understood particular assignments as a means to argue a cause on behalf of his subjects. He wished to speak for their needs as a "concerned photogra- pher."6 Glen G. Willumson's task in W. Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay is to analyze the photographic essay-where words and photographs are joined together-as it was conceived by the editors of Life magazine and executed by Gene Smith. The genre had its origins in Germany in the 1920s and reached its peek at Life. It was present in Life's first issue in 1936 with a memorable photo essay by Margaret Bourke White (photography's Margaret Mead) and continued until the genre petered out in the early 1960s, a victim of television. A photo essay was a collective endeavor. A topic would be chosen, most commonly by an editor; background data, leads, and material would be gathered and arranged by the magazine's staff; and, finally, a photographer would be sent to make the pictures following a preconceived script. After the photos were taken, the photographer's job was done. Processing the film, writing the text and the captions, and producing the magazine layout were left to the editors and staff. What makes Smith's relationship to Life interesting, beyond his immense importance as a photographer, were his efforts to gain more control for the photographer over the entire photo-essay, from the very beginning to the final layout. He never completely succeeded and resigned from Life when the magazine published an essay without his final consent. However, in the end, he greatly influenced the future role of the photojournalist. The fact that today's newspapers and magazines clearly credit the photographer is in some measure the result of Smith's tenacity and ferocious temper. Willumson's study methodically reviews four major photo-essays: "The Country Doctor" (September 20, 1948); "Spanish Village" (April 9, 1951); "Nurse Midwife" (December 3, 1951); and "A Man of Mercy" (November 15, 1954), an essay about Albert Schweitzer's Gabon hospital. For each, after reproducing the essay in its entirety, he considers in turn the concept and publication, a narrative and aesthetic reading, a political and ideological reading, and finally the public reception. The political readings are most interesting for they show that Smith's and Life magazine's interests were often at cross purposes. To Smith, "The Country Doctor" (his essay on Dr. Ceriani of Colorado) was a humane study of the hard, full life of a general practitioner. For Life, however, the essay provided an argument against national health care or "socialized medicine": what was needed was not government funds but incentives to persuade young doctors to fan out across the country. In Life's perspective,"The Country Doctor" gave a fine case of such a doctor. Similarly, Smith wanted to show in "Spanish Village" Franco's oppressive dictatorship as it was experienced in poor rural Spain under the eye of the Guardia Civil. Life, in contrast, wanted the essay on rural poverty in Spain as an argument in favor of pending United States foreign loans, the first to Spain since the Spanish Civil War. Money for Franco, but not for national health care, were Life's politics. Life's views were very much at variance with the life-long liberalism of Gene Smith. Thus, the same photographs served different and opposing purposes. We should not be surprised, as Elizabeth Edwards et al. have so amply demonstrated this possibility. Revealing, as well, is Smith's manner of work. Extraor- dinarily thorough, he carefully prepared each assignment, doing much of the preliminary research himself. When actually on assignment, he worked with tremendous concentration, and, for those times he focused on an individual, as with Dr. Ceriani and Nurse Maude Callen, he literally followed them everywhere from the moment they arose in the morning to when they retired at night. An ethnographer can relate well to Smith's way of working. The parallels with fieldwork are substantial, as is obvious from Willumson's accounts, especially the essays on the Spanish village and on Schweitzer's Gabon hospital: a topic is chosen and then systematically investi- gated within the total context of a particular community. Focusing on preindustrial farming, 878 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">Smith chose, after much travel, a single Spanish village, Deleitosa, where he associated primarily with one family, photographing its members in the fields, at home, and at social events. In the essay, he shows us an isolated village whose sole link to the rest of Spain is represented by the ominous Guardia Civil. Out of the 2,500 negatives Smith took in Spain, the Life essay presents 17. Other photographs from the set appear in different publications, but we never see anything near a major sample, although 99 appear in Johnson's catalog (1981:73-82). A major project for a visually inclined Hispanist would be to examine and to edit a significant corpus of the photographs, placing them in a wider social and cultural setting than we are given by art historians. Such a volume, to pick up on Goldberg's remark, could become the "standard by which work in ethnophotography would be judged" (p. 182). Willumson concludes by attempting to place Gene Smith in the larger tradition of contem- porary American photography. Here he is met by a quandary. His major assertion is that Smith's kind of photography was eclipsed by work of others, most particularly, that of Robert Frank, a Swiss immigrant, whose The Americans (1959) influenced the next generation of "people in the world," photographers including Gary Winogrand and Lee Friedlander among many others.7 The tenor of their work is "on the road," never showing much involvement with the subjects. It is often ironical, though never sarcastic, and an emotional distance is always maintained. Gene Thorton (1971) in the New York Times, taking up on the shift in taste, titled his review of Smith's huge 1971 retrospective show at the Jewish Museum as "Photographs: It Was News Then-Is It Now Art?" Willumson lists many references highly critical of Smith. He is an icon, he is a myth to be debunked, and so forth. One reason for an aggressive disassociation from Smith probably follows from the move of photography into the context of art. Johnson makes several pertinent curatorial remarks in his catalog of Smith's life work as he categorizes his photography. At one point Smith, living in New York City, took a series of photographs from window of his loft apartment entitled, "As from my window I sometimes glance," (excerpted in Life, March 10, 1958, as "Drama beneath a City Window," pp. 107-114). For Johnson, the resulting essay "is not journalism, sociology, or history, but art." Johnson labels another set "Experimental." It consists of incidental photo- graphs that are usually abstract and occasionally sexually explicit. Johnson says "they represent the purest (if not necessarily the best) of Smith's creative impulse" (1981:151). It seems, the purpose of the art historian and curator is to identify the art in the work, and these two examples permit Johnson to find it as the dominant feature of the work. If they are not art, then what are they, might be the conclusion. If only two, very minor parts of Smith's life's work can be unequivocally identified as art, then what can one do with all the rest? But if Smith had little acknowledged influence in art circles, his presence was and remains near the center of photography. Founded at his death was the annual Smith Award, a substantial sum, awarded to photographers who "furtherthe Iifetime goals of W. Eugene Smith" (Wi llumson 1992:287). Significant publications have been devoted to Smith's work, including a full-length biography (Hughes 1989); a monograph to accompany the posthumous exhibit, Let Truth Be the Prejudice (Smith 1985): a 1993 reissue of his first monograph (Smith 1993[1969]); and Johnson's comprehensive catalog, one of the only "catalogues raisonnes" ever compiled for a photographer. And Willumson himself is writing about Gene Smith, not Robert Frank nor any of his followers. In the end, I believe, the key to the art critics' discomfort about Gene Smith is quite simple. Gene Smith's work from beginning to the end was, with very few exceptions, afflicted with "barbarous taste." in praise of barbarous taste Pierre Bourdieu explores the social use of photography with two goals in mind. The first empirically discovers the underlying rules that govern ordinary photography. The second on fixing ethnographic shadows 879</page><page sequence="14">isolates, within photography, a system of social aesthetic judgments, which, using Kant's expression, he will call "Barbarous Taste." Originally published in 1965, Photography, a Middle Brow Art represents Bourdieu's initial statement on common aesthetics (1990[1965]). He elaborates it further in The Love of Art (Bourdieu and Darbel 1990[1969]) and further yet in Distinction (Bourdieu 1984[1979]). Photography divides into two topics. The first, written by Bourdieu, covers what we can call "family photography." The second describes the use of photography in contexts apart from the family. In turn, Robert Castel and Dominique Schnapper investigate photography clubs, Jean-Claude Chamboredon covers art photography, and Luc Boltanski and Chamboredon cover professional photographers. Our interests are with the empirical findings about family photography.8 Two commonplace observations start the analysis. First, in France, as elsewhere in the West, most families own cameras. The distribution of cameras is astounding and touches all walks of life. They are everywhere. Second, photography has no traditions and makes no real technical demands (as does, for example, playing a musical instrument). Theoretically, photography permits an anarchy of use. However, photography is in fact highly, even rigidly, conventional (p. 7). The photographs that consistently get taken should surprise no one, though the uniformity and lack of choice across all segments of French society might. Marked collective events, family gatherings, especially weddings, take a primary place, followed by photographs of young children. These are followed, in the more affluent strata, by holiday photographs taken with a family member directly in front of important monuments. The quintessential French honeymoon snapshot is "the couple photographed in front of the Eiffel Tower, because Paris is the Eiffel Tower, and because the true honeymoon is the honeymoon in Paris" (p. 36). Family photogra- phy is directly tied to family integration. All photographs, those that take a place in family photo albums, serve the "family function ... of solemnizing and immortalizing the high points of family life, in short, of reinforcing the integration of the family group" (p. 19). To look through an album of family photographs is to immerse oneself in family genealogy. The social norms that govern what can be photographed restrict the time, the place, and the subjects to be photographed. Outside of the predetermined range there is "nothing to photograph" (p. 34). Thus, photography in the family is an occasional practice: an appropriate event must occur before the camera can be put to use. With its severe constraints, family photography never uses the range of possibilities available to photography. An affluent family owning an expensive camera with several lens and various accessories (in today's market, say, a Canon EOS) and a working-class family with an old Kodak Instamatic will take essentially the same range of photographs. To explore the technical possibilities of cameras and to extend the kinds of subjects to be photographed, enthusiasts must depart from family practice. Often, a negative definition to a wider photography is given: it is photography that is not family photography. Thus, when a photographer extends beyond family practice, the role of family photographer is often given over to someone else in the family. Bourdieu places an independent, nonfamily photography neatly between tourism and attendance at concerts and art museums. He uses a grid of education versus expense. Tourism and travel are expensive but entail no particular education. Appreciation of art is inexpensive but requires education and preparation. Photography requires neither great expense nor education. It is open to anyone so inclined. Its position makes it attractive to the urban working class. (Bourdieu does not fill out the grid, but to do so, playing a musical instrument, a violin, for instance, would be both expensive and requiring of very considerable education.) Bourdieu's major aim is to establish a popular aesthetic for photography that will later serve him in defining a popular aesthetic in general. He identifies this aesthetic as that described by Kant when Kant writes that "[t]aste that requires an added element of charm and emotion for its delight, not to speak of adopting this as the measure of its approval, has not yet emerged from barbarism" (Kant 1952:65). Bourdieu elaborates, "tangible, informative or moral interest 880 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="15">is the supreme value of the popular aesthetic" (p. 92). An aesthetic based on a moral context sharply contrasts with Kant's classical notion of aesthetics where "the beautiful is that which pleases without concept" (quoted in Bourdieu and Darbel 1990[1969]:109). Popular photo- graphic taste, therefore, is barbarous taste. To summarize popular photography's barbarities, primarily it is its use in the "ritual of solemnization and consecration of the group and the world" (Bourdieu 1990[1965]:94). The subject matter is constrained. You do not photograph just anything. Respondents will say, "It is not something you would take a picture of" (1990[1965]:85). Nell Dorr's photograph of a nursing mother (plate 8; also in Steichen 1955:25) draws a comment of "Who would you show it to?" An abstract or meaningless object is refused, and the distortion of an object, especially the human face, "provokes such a feeling of outrage" mainly because it is taken as "a gratuitous attack on the thing represented" (Bourdieu 1990[1965]:94). A photograph is interpreted with respect to its context and judged in terms of the appropri- ateness of the object photographed. A peasant informant comments, in response to Russell Lee's FSA photograph of an old woman's hands (plate 7; also in Steichen 1955:79), about the context of age, work, and honesty, not the hands themselves but what the hands did, "the wonderful hands of a good farmer; hands like that have won agricultural prizes hundreds of times. That woman has worked in the fields as much as she has in the kitchen; she's certainly tended the vines, looked after the animals: very nice" (Bourdieu 1990[1965]:93). One barbarity, which does not concern Kant, though it might an art elite, truly delights Bourdieu: family photography is supremely democratic. "The Portrait Gallery has been democ- ratized and each family has, in the person of the head of the family, its appointed portraitist. To take photographs of one's children is to become the historiographer of their childhoods and to prepare as an heirloom for them the image of what they use to be" (Bourdieu 1990[1 965]:30). Finally, common aesthetics is indirectly understood by informants as in contrast to the scholarly aesthetic of a "legitimate culture." Thus, frequently encountered remarks like "Yes, it's very beautiful, but you'd have to like that sort of thing; it's not for me" lead Bourdieu to conclude that "a popular aesthetic is a dominated aesthetic" (p. 84). In the 30 years since Un art moyen was published, photography has come to be accepted as a fine art. Today, there is scarcely an art gallery that does not devote space to photography. Along with its establishment comes photography criticism and the introduction of photography into the curriculum of higher education. It is now sociologically an art, or at least some part of it is taken to be an art. As we saw with Willumson and Johnson, what part of photography is art and what not becomes problematic. Hierarchical distinctions are offered, of which some are very curious. Photographs that would interest an ethnographer will be labeled "documentary" and considered photographs of a lesser sort. However old documentary photographs take on a patina of art, or at least a value in the art market.9 One spin-off of photography's acceptance as a fine art is the fierce debates that ultimately hinge on the indexicality of the photograph. Pleasure without concept to create an "art for art's sake" would disassociate the photograph from its referent. It would downplay, if not deny outright, a photograph's indexicality. This might be well and good for studio photographs, but it is not so easily accepted when the object is "of the world," especially of "people in the world." The responsibility that both a photojournalist like Gene Smith and an anthropologist feel toward a human subject is not necessarily shared by photographic aesthetes. Richard Avedon's nasty photographs of ordinary people (In the American West, 1985) are dissociated from the people photographed. Avedon avowed that he only understands the finished photograph, not the subject, and his apologists talk of his creating transcendent archetypes (Bolton 1989). An ethnophotographer, no matter how attracted to photographic aesthetics, will much prefer, surely, an aesthetic based on barbarous taste to a "true taste," if the latter entails a disinterest leading to hostility for a very particular human referent. on fixing ethnographic shadows 881</page><page sequence="16">an ethnophotography An ethnographer, with barbarous taste, comes to fieldwork with a still camera. He or she might be a shutterbug. There are two common motives for taking pictures in the field. First, fieldwork is an experience in a different world away from home. Despite the intense preparation and deep commitmentto a serious and meaningful research, fieldwork is also travel and tourism. It falls into the category of experience that, as Bourdieu shows, calls for photographs to "solemniz[e] and immortaliz[e] the high points of family life," where the family extends out to the community of fieldwork. Although the photographs are private, they are in no way trivial. They are as important as fields notes and recorded texts, though they are important in a different way. The second motive is to use photographs as research aids. Here is their common ancillary role and the possibilities are many, ranging from creating images of material culture to helping identify participants at one event or another. This use of the camera as a research tool is exhaustively presented by Collier and Collier in their 1986 guide. But what would be a more central role for photography? To pick up on Serge Tornay's characterization of an ethnophotography "in the service of others," we can offer two angles, somewhat like those suggested by Tornay himself. The models come from photography, not from anthropology, and certainly not from the scientific anthropology of previous generations. Photographers are never confined to one or the other. There is the didactic photography as represented in the photographic essay. A story is defined and the photographer methodically follows through a script. Gene Smith provides the best example, and the contemporary Brazilian photographer, Sabastao Salgado (1990, 1993), carries on the tradition. Emmanuel Garrigues's Goutte d'Or project can be thought of as an ethnographic instance. Often the script takes a political turn when the camera is used to champion a humanitarian cause. Smith's last work, Minimata, done in collaboration with his second wife, Aileen, is an example. In the spirit of Lewis Hine's work for child labor laws in the 1910s, the Smiths chronicled the horrors of industrial mercury pollution in a Japanese fishing community (Smith and Smith 1975). The other possibility is less easily identified as ethnographic, although the changes in our understanding of what ethnography is should embrace it. We come back to Pierre Verger when he speaks of intuitive impressions, of feeling and not necessarily trying to understand. Many photographers can serve as examples, but consider for a start French photography. Henri Cartier-Bresson (1952) called his first collection Images a la Sauvette ("pictures on the run," known in English as The Decisive Moment, and a number of his contemporaries, like Willy Ronis (1980, 1985), Robert Doisneau (1979, 1986), and Janine Niepce (1992), have spent their lives wandering over France in efforts to evoke a sense of what being French and living in France is all about. Gary Winogrand (1988) is an American equivalent. Although he probably would not have included work of this sort under ethnography, John Collier, Jr., characterized it very well when, in an otherwise censorious review of Frank Cancian's (1974) photographs of Zinacanteco peasants, he observed that: After looking through Another Place, the differences that really seem to matter are the qualities of eyes and the fluency and composure of bodies.... What Cancian's records hold are the human delicacies that many statements in anthropology, for reasons of discipline, have left out. [Collier 1 974:61 ] We have, therefore, Pierre Verger's relaxed but intuitive impressions guiding a disciplined use of the camera that fixes "the human delicacies" that are beyond a verbal ethnography. Gene Smith's work fits here as well. In fact, it was his supreme ability to show human delicacies at the same time as he reports and tells a story that makes him so important today or, at least, important for us who are afflicted with barbarous taste. Finally, in sum, this latter, elusive ethnophotography consists of a visual poetic where the operator fixes a "body swayed to music" and fixes a "brightening glance" in an attempt to solve, visually and ethnographically, W. B. Yeats's wish to "know the dancer from the dance." 882 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="17">notes Acknowledgments. I wish to acknowledge the help of my wife Betty in pushing for clarity. Her patience has been marvelous. Over the years, near and distant voices have encouraged me in curious and quiet ways to bring my photography and my love for it out into a more open venue.

Taylor (1992) lumps Emerson and Robertson together as romantic upper-class intruders into a peasant world. That may be the case; however, Emerson left us with a remarkable collection of photographs of turn-of-the-century East Anglia farmers. All that Robertson gives us are dress-up charades, with no ethnographic value beyond information on how he amused himself. 2. Malek Alloula falls into a similar trap. In his study of colonial representations of the "harem" as seen in photographs appearing on early-20th-century post cards, he repeatedly identifies an essentialized "photographer" (1986:7, 11, 14, and so forth). Thus, on the very few occasions when a photograph showing rapport and admiration for its subject appears, Alloula finds himself rather at a loss. In one instance, he must invent "the" photographer's "jubilant vacillation" (1986:35 referring to a photograph appearing on page 33) and, not satisfied with that, goes on to exorcise the photographer's skill and the photograph's excellence by calling it "an unexpected happenstance," a statistical rarity (1986:130, note 17). Further, he finds that his overall argument forces him to resist any "posthumous tribute to the art of the photographer" when examining "[t]he extraordinary portrait on p. 121 or the fantastic surrealism of the postcard on p. 126" (1986:116). But if he could have, or would have, identified particular photographers, for example, a certain Gertrude White or a Lewis Cameron, Alloula would have then been able to make his tribute without disturbing his argument. 3. Translations from the L'Ethnographie volume are mine, as is the translation of Pamela's quotation from Niepce (1992). 4.
