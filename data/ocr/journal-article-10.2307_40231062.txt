<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume VIII, Number 3, September 1978 CRITICAL NOTICE Gregory Vlastos, Plato's Universe (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1975). xiv + 130 pp. The three lectures this volume comprises were delivered under the terms of a trust devoted to 'the impact of science and philosophy on man's perception of a rational universe'. They conform to the terms and intent of the trust much more scrupulously than lectures in such a series usually do. Their topic is the relation between the cosmology presented in Plato's Timaeus and the rational world-view developed by earlier Greek thinkers, and the relation between both of these world-views and the presuppositions of what one nowadays understands by 'science'. The book is a model of expository prose, lucid and persuasive, elegant and tightly argued. The argument is marked throughout by the fairness, carefulness, and candour that one expects from its author, even though in view of the public occasion he gives less space than he sometimes does to the elimination of alternative views and the establishing of details. But despite all its virtues, the overall effect is disconcerting. On the surface, the argument is perfectly lucid and straightforward; at a deeper level, it is wholly baffling. The position argued for is finely nuanced, the work of a subtle and delicate mind elucidating a lifetime's study; but it appears to rest on presuppositions about the conditions of rationality and the nature of modern science that are at best over-simple and at worst crude, dogmatic, antiquated and confused. The lectures resume a debate from the early decades of the present century. The debate sees the growth of philosophy from Anaximander to Democritus as the emergence from an age of superstition and mythology of an approach to understanding the 599</page><page sequence="2">F. E. Sparshott universe that foreshadows that of modern science. Against the background of this progress it sees Plato's Timaeus repudiating the materialism of his predecessors and reinstating a shaping intelligence at the origin of the cosmological or cosmogonical process. The question debated was whether Plato's work was merely reactionary in its intent and effect, or whether his insistence on mathematical (specifically, geometrical) form contributed something essential to science. The debate turned partly on the interpretation of the rise of modern science, as typified by Galileo: did that revolution represent the re-assertion of a Platonic world-view against an Aristotelian one, as Koy rÂ£ and others argued, or did it rather rediscover the suppressed mechanism of Democritus and invoke that against Plato and Aristotle alike? Vlastos avows that he has long held and still holds the latter view, and therefore used to side with those who thought Plato's effect was wholly bad; but he now thinks that in his historical context Plato's betrayal of Greek rationalism was fruitful, contributing something essential to a way of thinking that had run into an impasse. The old debate was, after all, rather pointless. Plato was separated from modern science by two millennia. It is more fruitful to examine his relation to the Greek conceptual scheme that was eventually to make science possible, and specifically to the concept of the kosmos, the universe as a single ordered system. It is by shifting his viewpoint in this way that Vlastos has come to his re-evaluation. The perspective he adopts is not of course a new one, and it is hard to believe that any serious student consciously committed himself to the approach here repudiated. What is new is rather the clarity with which the distinction is seen and the conscientiousness with which Vlastos seeks to observe it and draw its consequences. Unfortunately, he does not always live up to his best insights. The first lecture expounds the idea of a kosmos. Originally and essentially, this turns out to be the kind of order that an ordering intelligence might impart to an army in training and drilling it or to a place in tidying it, and derivatively that which is so ordered. In Greek philosophy the word comes to mean the world as a system, or that part of it which constitutes such a system. But although the very idea of a kosmos is derived from the notion of what an intelligent being would do in organizing or arranging something, Vlastos urges that what thinking of the world as a kosmos came down to was in effect nothing other than replacing ad hoc explanations of phenomena by a single causal and explanatory order called physis or 'nature', and that in practice this simply meant the elimination of references to intelligent purpose in explaining events. The sort of thing that had to be eliminated is typified by the ascription of excited or atypical behaviour to divine possession (ate), and by the ascription of 600</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of G. Vlastos, Plato's Universe meteorological and other catastrophes to the interest taken by some god in the fortunes of some or all of those afflicted. Vlastos has no difficulty in showing that these ancient patterns of pseudo-explana- tion did not disappear with the rise of philosophy, as some historians have suggested, but persisted in the minds even of sophisticated people to Plato's day, and it is easy to accept his judgment that the temptation to have recourse to them is the greatest threat to rational explanations of natural phenomena. It is for this reason that Plato's introduction of a craftsman-god who shapes the world according to his own ideas of beauty is taken to be a direct repudiation of everything that had been painfully achieved by a few heroic minds in the preceding two centruries. To illustrate the notion of akosmos Vlastos gives a stimulating and eloquent account of the system of Heracleitus, in whose work we find the first surviving use of the term in its speculative application. What is most significant in Heracleitus is that the order invoked is a dynamic process, a system of changes, not an equilibrium in which change would figure as disorder. It is the natural process itself that is rational and hence divine, not a supernatural legislator in whose work some other supernatural being might subsequently interfere. In this, Heracleitus is typical of the Greek writers on nature, the physiologoi : because theworshipof the gods was entrenched incivic rite and feeling, they dared not deny the gods outright; they could only fill the world so full of physis that there was no room for any alternative way of explaining events. Since everything could be explained by rational appeal to the inherent qualities of things, there was nothing left for the gods to do. The remaining two lectures explain why Plato's intervention was not so disastrous as one would expect. The second lecture is devoted to the astronomy of the Timaeus. A truly observational astronomy began to develop for the first time in the history of the world at the time of Plato's boyhood. This was the only field in which Greek speculation was ever to be effectively controlled by observation; the claims so often made for Greek medicine in this regard are without substance, as Vlastos points out. And in astronomy Plato shows himself a close and up-to-date student of the empirical science of his day. He does not argue, as a reading of the Republic might lead one to expect, either that the anomalies of planetary motion are due to the whimsies of the souls animating the stars, or that the observed motions are mere approximations to intelligible simplicities and hence not themselves intelligible. Rather, his belief in an aesthetically-motivated craftsman-god leads him to formulate the famous demand that astronomical theories 'preserve the appearances', analyzing whatever apparent irregularities might be 601</page><page sequence="4">F. E . Sparshott observed into systematically interacting regularities. Vlastos urges against many recent authorities that all the evidence suggests that this idea, which was to be enormously fruitful for many centuries to come, was Plato's original contribution. The last lecture is devoted to Plato's theory of the structure of matter. In this area, as Vlastos easily demonstrates again, against much recent authority there could be no question of checking theory by observation, but here too Plato is faithful to the best and most advanced thought of his day. He preserves in a speculatively advanced form the two main insights of the atomistic materialism he affects to despise, and adherence to which the Laws would make a capital offence: the reduction of a multitude of qualitative differences to a small number of formal differences, and the recognition that the properties and laws of behaviour of matter on a scale below the threshold of perception need have nothing in common with those operative in the macroscopic world as we perceive it. In this area, Plato is acquitted of harm rather than praised for a positive contribution. In fact, aside from drawing attention to the formal weaknesses in Plato's attempt to identify the four supposed elements with the five regular solids and to correlate elemental transformations with the permutations of their bounding surfaces, Vlastos is at a loss to find appropriate criteria by which Plato's success or failure could be measured. Since observational tests are not available, and no principle can be discovered for deciding which particular processes are prime candidates for explanation, it is hard to see what explanatory value Plato and his contemporaries could claim for their speculations. In its main lines, Vlastos's book is a wholly admirable exposition of those aspects of Plato's cosmology that he deals with, in relation to their contemporary setting. What seems questionable, aside from two particular issues that will be mentioned later, is the interpretation and evaluation of the Demiurge, the creator-craftsman whom Plato introduces as cosmogonical means to his cosmology. Vlastos's evaluation of Plato's relation to the physiologoi whose notion of the kosmos he steals and subverts seems to rest on a failure to distinguish three kinds of explanation or pseudo-explanation that invoke a divine mind. The first of these ascribes the apparent order of the world to its compliance with a divine plan, a plan that is rational because the planner is rational and discoverable by men because men also are rational and all rational beings think alike in so far as they are rational. The second ascribes the processes that make up the ordinary course of nature to a divine intent that is arbitrary, or at least inscrutable: whatever happens happens because god, or some god or other, wills it so, and cannot be further explained. The third, 602</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of C. Vlastos, Plato's Universe whatever account it may give of the ordinary course of nature, maintains that some occurrences fall outside that course, and that these abnormal events are due to a divine intervention in the course of nature, an intervention that may be arbitrary but is more likely to be motivated by a wish to further or frustrate some human plans and accordingly to be open to influence by prayer or theurgy. The implications of these three patterns of explanation are very different. Vlastos recognizes that Plato has adopted the first, but assumes that he has thereby adopted the second and countenanced the third. "Would this divine world-creator have the power to violate the regularities of nature?" he asks (p. 25). "The answer is not clear. What is clear is that he will never choose to exercise it." This plainly assumes that the choice of laws of nature, and the decision not to overrule them, is an essentially arbitrary exercise of a personal will. But there is no ground for this assumption. Even more glaringly, he asserts that Plato's principles of mentalistic explanation were such that he could have explained complex planetary motions by saying "Aren't the moon and the five planets gods, with a mind and a will of their own?" (p. 58). But the very notion of 'a mind of one's own' that is somehow coupled with 'a will of one's own' (and in English idiom the expressions are indeed virtually synonymous) is out of place in this context. The idea of reason invoked seems to be the instrumental one of a 'slave of the passions'; but that is not the notion of mind and reason that is operative in Plato or Aristotle, or for that matter in Heracleitus and Anaxagoras. Vlastos writes as though Plato's assertions that the Demiurge does this or that because it is best so, or most beautiful so, were appeals to the subjective taste of an unknown being. But the dogma that beauty and excellence are matters of personal or cultural preference is one that Plato repudiates. Timaeus is after all represented as knowing what the Demiurge found beautiful, and he knows this not because he has some special information but because the grounds of the beauty can be stated. Circular motion is excellent not because circles look pretty to this or that person, but because it admits of endless regular continuation on a single principle in a finite space; certain triangles are beautiful not because architects are observed to employ them in their designs but because of the ways in which other figures can be generated from them. Motions and triangles are good because only they will serve to generate an intelligible order in which movements and transformations are possible without arbitrary changes of course or principle. Such speculation, however low we may rate it, is at the farthest possible remove from the invocation of inscrutable purposes and miraculous interventions. In fact, it follows 603</page><page sequence="6">F. E. Sparshott Vlastos's preferred pattern of explanation in that it explains phenomena by the inherent properties of things. The difference is that it goes on to ask the question : what properties must things have for a /cosmos to be possible, and hence forcosmological speculation to have a hope of success? The peculiarity of Vlastos's approach is that he seems to equate reason with the irrational. That is, materialist explanations are rational because they make no reference to reason; mentalistic explanations are irrational because they invoke reason. Curiously, he begins by emphasizing that the very idea of kosmos derives from the verb kosmein, to reduce to order, and thus invokes an order-giving agent; but then it is as if he forgot that, and supposed that the notion of a kosmos was somehow independently intelligible. But what, then, is a kosmos* What is the difference between order and disorder? For, after all, even the most chaotic set of things and happenings is what it is and has just the form or 'order' that it has. No limits can be imposed a priori on the form a correct description of the world should take, unless we presuppose that physis must be something the human mind can grasp as orderly, regular, seemly. And what reason could we have to suppose that, unless we presume that the world is as it is because it conforms to the requirements of an intelligence that is sufficiently like our own that we can recognize its laws of operation? One might well think, as many have thought, that only someone animated by such a conviction would take the notion of a natural order seriously enough to make any serious progress in science, until the demonstrated success of scientific method and conjecture had given investigators the confidence to carry on without worrying about the implications of what they were doing. In any case, the idea that natural events will be regular because they are regulated can hardly be, as Vlastos seems to think it must be, any sort of obstacle to scientific progress. In fact, one might go further and suggest that even the third pattern of mind-invoking explanation, the one that supposes that the natural order is subject to occasional miraculous disruptions, is not really inimical to science or to any rational explanation of phenomena scientific theory does not stand or fall by a claim to predict historical events in detail, since it is not normally possible to ascertain either initial states or boundary conditions, and it is not in the laboratory but at banquets that water is alleged to be scandalously turned into wine. But such a suggestion would be gratuitous here, since Plato regards such a view of divine action as no less criminally blasphemous than the denial of divinity (and hence of rationality in the universe) altogether. What must surely block the scientific enterprise is the second way of invoking a divine mind : a readiness to say that all things are as they are because 604</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice of G. Vlastos, Plato's Universe some god willed it so, from spite or prejudice or simply because he felt like it. That is the refusal of explanation that science excludes; and it is that pattern of cosmogony, rather than the divine or demonic breaches of natural order that Vlastos dwells on, that the rationalism of the physiologoi most significantly replaces. Vlastos is of course well aware of the relevant distinctions and of their significance. It is therefore puzzling that he should lapse into such thorough confusion. It is as though the word 'mind' triggered off a sort of reflex horror, a fear that any reference to any sort of intelligent agency will open the floodgates to barbarism and superstition. But such a fear would be irrational. The three patterns of explanation or pseudo-explanation here distinguished are at least as different from each other as any one of them is from the descriptive materialism that seems to be the only pattern of explanation Vlastos would countenance. The discovery of the kosmos was the discovery of reason, not its rejection. It is integral to Vlastos's position that he should take Democritean atomism as the paradigm of what Plato subverted: an entirely naturalistic, wholly unified world-picture, unafraid to reduce the multiplicity of appearances to a simple schematism to which nothing in experience corresponds. But surely Aristotle was right when he remarked that Democritus does not explain the kosmos at all. Variations in the motions and forms of atoms correspond to variations in sensible qualities, but do not explain those qualities, which Democritus attributes to 'convention' without reflecting that the existence of such conventions thereby becomes itself something that his system must explain. More importantly, even within the mechanistic limitations of his system the motions and forms he postulates are entirely unrelated to the kosmos they are supposed to explain. Democritus does not even try to make the fortuitous concourse of atoms account for the kind of regularity that the world-system displays. Instead, as Vlastos says, he merely postulates a local vortex to which he ascribes without more ado the required ordering properties, in the offhand manner of earlier cosmographical speculation. Aristophanes took the measure of this device when he made a character in the Clouds say, "Vortex rules and has cast out Zeus"; for ascribing everything to a mysterious vortex has no more explanatory value than ascribing everything to an unknown god. That Democritus failed to explain the kosmos is a reproach in his own day, but not in ours. It is misleading to suggest, as Vlastos does, that the Greek idea of the kosmos is presupposed by modern science; and the example of Heracleitus is unfortunate in this regard. For although it is true that the order imagined by Heracleitus is one of process rather than of pattern, it is essential to it that the process 605</page><page sequence="8">F. E. Sparshott sustains a pattern, a closed system. And it is characteristic of modern science that its laws are purely general and hypothetical in form: not only will they hold in any system whatever, but the real world to which we apply them is not in fact a system at all. What is significant in Democritus is not only that his theory is one of imaginative and prophetic daring, but that its underlying dynamism is as purely general as that of modern science. Its failure to explain the kosmos is in the long run its greatest strength. When Vlastos attributes the revival of fifth century atomism in the seventeenth century to its inspired prevision of the course of modern science, he would be right if he were referring to this generality in its scope. But he seems also to have in mind its specific content, the mechanics of impetus and impact; and here one must demur. That mechanics, despite its historical association with the rise of modern physics, never had any claim to be the order to which every event in the universe must be reduced. One supposes that its vogue stemmed primarily from the urgent interest in ballistics occasioned by the development of firearms. What was vital in Galilean and ultimately in Newtonian mechanics was not the model of impact between bodies, but the mathematical form of the laws of acceleration. And this was something for which neither Democritus nor Plato held any precedent whatever. Vlastos evidently thinks of the universe as the domain of mechanics, and in effect equates natural science with physics and chemistry. But this supposition that life and the life sciences can be left out of account, as though living things were supernatural or non-existent, is indefensible in itself and disastrous in interpreting any Greek thinker. The kosmos of the Greeks included the domain of biology and psychology: the order to be explained was one in which the origin, generation, and nutrition of living things, including humans, played a large part. The early modern physics that Vlastos takes as his model never seriously tried to incorporate human or even animal behaviour within the formal scope of its theories. In fact, to this day such incorporation remains partly a programme, partly a fiction, and partly something one does not even bother with because the task of a science is not to explain everything but to explain a specific range of phenomena. In this respect also the Greek notion of a kosmos is so far from being presupposed by modern science that the two cannot be reconciled, for the Greek view requires that no system of laws be accepted that does not include the phenomena of life as an integral part. And not only an integral part, but the most striking part. It is to the regularities of genetics 'Man begets man' that Aristotle has recourse when he wishes to illustrate the kind of regularity that constitutes the orderliness of the world. It is 606</page><page sequence="9">Critical Notice of G. Vlastos, Plato's Universe specifically because Democritean atomism contains nothing that could conceivably account for those regularities that he rejects it as an explanation of the kosmos as such. What holds generally for Greek cosmology holds for the Timaeus in a special way. Timaeus presents his world-picture explicitly as a necessary background for a Utopian psycho-politics like that of the Republic. The only world-order that could meet this requirement would be one in which continuity is preserved between astronomy, physics, chemistry, physiology, psychology and sociology. Vlastos nowhere mentions this necessary context for the cosmological discussion he examines, nor does he mention those parts of Plato's scheme in the Timaeus itself that involve human beings. The misrepresentation is serious. By portraying Plato's intentions and the legitimate expectations of his public as proto-Galilean, confined to the mechanics of matter in motion in inorganic contexts, he is able to make it seem outrageous that Plato should build a constructive intelligence and a vital principle into the beginnings of his world-picture. Plato might reply that it is much more outrageous to claim completeness for a world-view in which such phenomena as the formulation of world-views are not provided for. If one concedes that the world is one in which there is life and thought, and that therefore the fundamental principles of the world's architecture must be such that vital and intellectual phenomena can be explained in their terms that these' appearances must be preserved, no less than those of planetary motions then the basic scheme of the Timaeus makes some sense. Since there are intelligent beings, a principle of intelligence must be there from the start; since there are living things, there must be a vital principle; since there is matter, a material principle; since there are regularities, a formal principle. And what this suggests is that cosmology is not a scientific enterprise: cosmology cannot meet the standards of science, and science cannot fulfil the demands of cosmology. Science cannot supersede cosmology, because it cannot invalidate the demand for a total picture; and cosmology, of course, cannot anticipate or overrule science. How a cosmology can be judged to have met the requirement of comprehensiveness is a good question. Whatever the requirements are, Plato's craftsman-god strapping soul-stuff around the world is an acknowledgement that they must be met. But how are we to understand that grotesque figure? Here again Vlastos's supposition that the world to be explained is an inorganic one and that the Demiurge is a gratuitous reversion to superstition leads him astray. He asserts that we are to take Plato literally when he attributes the world to a craftsman-god, but he seems not to have given much 607</page><page sequence="10">F. E. Sparshott thought to the question what taking Plato literally would amount to. All he does is refer us in a footnote to other writings of his in which those who maintain the contrary are said to be refuted. But the gist of those writings seems only to be that the Demiurge is not a mythological figure, as some have urged, because he does not have a name and a history and a set of concrete motives, as characters in myths do: Plato in fact is writing speculative cosmology, not myth. That is certainly true, and makes one wonder why in this new book Vlastos calls the Timaeus a 'metaphysical fairy tale' and writes as though the Demiurge were a quasi-human person with 'a mind and a will of his own'. One supposes that the argument would run as follows. If the Demiurge were a figure of myth, like those who appear in the myths Plato provides in other dialogues, we would know that he must be taken allegorically. But he is not such a figure. There is therefore no reason for Plato to introduce him, unless he thinks the world really was created at the beginning of time by an intelligent being. So Plato is to be taken literally, and that means that Plato began by imagining a quasi-person and making up stories about what he might have done. But here Vlastos seems to go much too far. Nothing is more evident than that the accounts of what the Demiurge does cannot themselves be taken literally. As Vlastos points out, the 'soul stuff that the Demiurge makes, and cuts, and moulds, has none of the properties of physical matter. But what lacks those properties cannot be cut and moulded. So Plato cannot be taken literally. It is idle for Vlastos to say of such passages, "It is no use asking how the Demiurge manages to carry out this stupendous operation. We are dealing here with a strictly supernatural event (the event which creates nature and is not itself a member of the sequence of events that constitutes the natural order)" (p. 70n.). The operations are not stupendous but impossible, in that their descriptions are self-contradictory; and, as Vlastos himself points out, Plato has no equivalent for the weasel word 'supernatural'. Vlastos seems to be fathering on Plato the thought-processes appropriate to an exceptionally benighted Sunday school. In fact, as we remarked before, the Demiurge is so far from being personalized that Timaeus can say a priori what his operations must have been, simply from considering what the requirements of formal elegance are. That is, the Demiurge is simply a back-projection from the universe whose order he is to explain; he is no more than the order-giver implicit in the notion of a kosmos itself. It is a familiar observation that the most intelligible way to describe such an order as an ordering agency might impose is by reconstructing the ordering process necessary to produce it. And there seems no reason to suppose that Plato is doing anything else here. 608</page><page sequence="11">Critical Notice of G. Vlastos, Plato's Universe When Vlastos says (pp. 96-97) that Democritus gives "the intellectual satisfaction in figuring out systematically what the world would be like if it were cosmos if it were rational through and through/' but that the Timaeus offers a "brilliant alternative" for those who "found faith in the supernatural a spiritual necessity,. . . turning it paradoxically into the very source of the natural order/' he could hardly be more wrong. There is no paradox in the matter. In the first place, Democritus's world is not 'rational', in that the systematic element in his system does not account for the world as ordered. In the second place, if the criterion of order is the satisfaction of the mind's sense of intelligibility, it is not paradoxical to impute order to an intelligent agency. And in the third place, the Demiurge is hardly the sort of being that 'faith in the supernatural' would invoke; he is not presented as a providential deity, nor even as a person, since he is endowed with no attributes other than that of an intelligence apt to frame the kosmos. In Plato and Aristotle explicitly, and already in Anaxagoras by implication, intellect (nous), though manifested only in living things, is not associated with personality but contrasted with it. It is just because of the impersonality of mathematics and philosophy that nous is postulated as a separate faculty. All men think alike in so far as they think truly on universal matters, and this is taken to show that what thinks in them is something other than the sensitive and appetitive system of their personal selves. A postulated deity whose operations are all on the noetic level is hardly a possible substitute for the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. The concept of nous as pure intellect, as finally made explicit by Aristotle, which I have just suggested is the key concept in understanding the Demiurge, is not an easy one to grasp, and is perhaps incoherent. It abstracts the forms of intellectual products from the vital processes of their discovery, and substitutes for those processes suppositious quasi-processes that mirror logical relationships and take place instantaneously if they take place at all. The underlying way of thinking was preserved until quite recently in the description of logic as 'the laws of thought'. Despite our strictures above, Vlastos is right on one crucial point. Such a notion does represent an uneasy compromise, if not between superstition and rationality, then between personality and impersonality, between logic and psychology. It purports to exclude personality, but by retaining the language of action and thought it perpetually re-personalizes logic. It is just this muddled way of thinking that the figure of the Demiurge panders to. And although eventually Aristotle tried to work out the idea of a kosmos without a kosmetes, so that a teleological explanation in terms of the natural order is no more than one in which the maximally ordered state of a process enters 609</page><page sequence="12">F. E . Sparshott irreducibly into the explanation of that process and it is explicitly denied that any purpose or intelligence is involved, even he did not maintain his official line consistently, and in his less conscientiously articulated passages his language relapsed continually into anthropomorphism. I conclude with two brief comments on specific issues. First, Vlastos says that the popular Greek habit of attributing a person's aberrant conduct to divine intervention and yet holding him responsible for it is inconsistent: "Believing that someone is acting under the influence of ate is logically incompatible with holding him responsible for his action," because "To hold a man responsible for his act, it must be his" (p. 14). Vlastos does not support this assertion with any sketch for an analysis of the concept of responsibility, and I doubt if it is tenable. Responsibility is not straightforwardly a psychological notion: I can assume responsibilities, and jobs carry responsibilities with them. What I am responsible for in a given situation is more or less what I can be held to account for, and accountability need not be a simple matter. If a god distorts my mental processes and makes me do something I would not have decided to do but for his interference, it is not at all clear how this affects my accountability. As between the god and me, no doubt the god should be held to account; but the god is not there to answer for the action, and I am. Moreover, divine interference, like ignorance of the law, is a plea that can never be allowed, or everyone would plead it. There really is no reason why one should not admit and deny responsibility for the same action in the same context, for one may be simultaneously accountable to different people or to the same people in different ways. And as for whether an action that a god makes me decide to do is mine or not, there seems to be no obvious answer: I did it, and decided to do it, even though the god also did it and decided to do it. It seems to me that the logical grammar of such concepts as ate and responsibility require some subtlety in investigation, and are not to be disposed of so summarily as Vlastos's bluff manner suggests. The other issue that calls for comment is of a different sort. Vlastos criticizes Plato's theory of material transformations on its own terms. Since there are four elements, it is a defect that one of them, earth, must be constituted from triangular segments that cannot constitute the other three, so that earth is excluded from material transformations; and the association of the pentagon-faced dodecahedron not with an element but with the spherical whole of the universe is a lame and sophistical expedient. On the latter point I would agree, but the former is open to question. The untransformability of the fourth element is not glossed over but 610</page><page sequence="13">Critical Notice of C. Vlastos, Plato's Universe insisted on. That might be making a virtue of necessity, but it is not intuitively absurd to erect a speculative chemistry on a single inert and stable element and three labile and intertransformable ones. If the whole idea of a world-process of elemental transformation is based on the processes of evaporation and condensation, as it seems to be, there seems to be no special reason for including the precipitation of solids in the cycle, and then there is nothing odd in thinking of the cycle of changes as essentially the intertransformabil- ity of liquids, vapours, and fires, within and around a solid mass. If anything, an earth-centred world-picture in which the earth remains solidly as it is is more plausible than one in which it is involved in process. But one must admit that the rules of the game Plato was playing are so obscure that it is hard for us to tell when he was cheating. July 1977 F. E.
