<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primary and Secondary Qualities By JOHN J. MACINTOSH (CALGARY, CANADA) Zusammenfassung Weder historisch noch philosophisch kann man zu nur einer einzigen Unterschei- dung zwischen primären und sekundären Qualitäten gelangen. Es gibt vielmehr eine große Zahl von Unterscheidungen, die miteinander vermengt und wie eine einzige behandelt werden, und zwar einfach deshalb, weil man bei der Diskussion des Problems wahllos einige Beispiele herausgreift. In diesem Aufsatz werden zweiundzwanzig solcher Unterscheidungen angeführt, wobei Bezug genommen wird auf Philosophen, die diese Unterscheidungen vertreten haben. Im Anschluß daran wird die Vermutung geäußert, daß der Grund für diesen verworrenen Zustand zum Teil im Fehlen einer plausiblen Theorie der Qualitäten zu suchen sei. Da eine solche Theorie fehlt, ist es nicht verwunderlich, daß die Einteilung von Qualitäten und vermeintlichen Qualitäten in primäre und sekundäre Schwie- rigkeiten bereitet. Most discussions of primary and secondary qualities take it for granted that there is such a distinction, and many then proceed to try and say what, exactly, that distinction is. That this assumption is mistaken can be seen as soon as the relevant historical texts are looked at with only slightly closer attention than they usually receive. Moreover, it is a mistake that seems to be generated in part from a philosophical habit that we all recognize, in the abstract, to be a bad one: that of choosing examples from too narrow a range, and concentrating, within that range, on too small a group. I want to suggest in this paper that there is no single distinction between primary and secondary qualities : rather, there are a number of different distinctions, which may or may not be of philosophical or scientific interest, which are and have been thought of as one distinction because they sort a suitably small number of examples into the same pigeon holes. It is, I think, worth demonstrating this on its own, but I shall also briefly indicate some reasons for thinking that any general sorting procedure of this kind is unlikely to be philosophically important or worthwhile, even though more modest procedures may be, or are. Of this, more in the sequel. First, though, the claim that there is no single distinction. Here are, more or less off hand, some twenty odd ways of making a distinction. All yield lists which show at least family resemblances: exten- sion, motion and rest, solidity, tend to get into one box; colour, smell, taste, tend to get into the other. These traditional lists, incidentally, are start- lingly short and astoundingly similar. For, I suppose that there are an infinite, or at least an indefinitely large, number of qualities. How inter- esting a coincidence it is then, that everyone so regularly stops short with a Studia Leibnitiana, Band VIII/1 (1976) &lt;c) Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, BRD</page><page sequence="2">Primary and Secondary Qualities 89 list of half a dozen or so of each sort, and how surprising that there is so much overlap in the lists of exemplars they offer. Well, let us leave that, though it makes one think, and look at some ways of distinguishing among qualities. I am not suggesting for a moment that these ways - which I present in, roughly, chronological order - are the only ways of making a distinction which, given a suitably short list of tested qualities, will yield the "right" distribution. Nor am I suggesting that they are the only ways that have been offered. But they will, I trust, be suf- ficient to make the point. (1) Let's begin with the earliest distinctions that were drawn in what might be called the modern era. Galileo suggested that primary qualities are those qualities which are conceptually inseparable from bodies ; second- ary qualities are what are left. He wrote, in 1623: "... whenever I conceive any material or corporeal substance, I immediately feel the need to think of it as bounded, and as having this or that shape, as being large or small in relation to other things, and in some specific place at any given time; as being in motion or at rest; as touching or not touching some other body, and as being one in number, or few, or many. From these conditions I cannot separate such a substance by any stretch of my imagination. But that it must be white or red, bitter or sweet, noisy or silent, and of sweet or foul odour, my mind does not feel compelled to bring in as necessary accompaniments."1 This distinction can also be found, quite explicitly, in Hobbes2, Leibniz3, 1 Galileo, II Saggiatore, trans. Still man Drake, in: Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo, p. 274 * Hobbes, De Corpore, 2.8.3: . . .there are certain accidents which can never perish except the body perish also; for no body can be conceived to be without extension, or without figure. All other accidents, which are not common to all bodies, but peculiar to some only as to be at rest, to be moved, colour, hardness, and the like, do perish continually, and are succeeded by others ; yet so, as that the body never perisheth." 3 Leibniz, letter to Jacob Thomasius, April 20/30, 1669: ". . .no other things are necessary besides mind, matter, space, and motion . . . The human mind can in fact imagine nothing other than mind (when it thinks of itself), space, matter, motion, and the things which result from the relations of these terms to each other. ... It remains to prove, by more subtle reasoning, that in explaining the nature of bodies we cannot assume any other entities than those which I have named. This is done as follows. Everyone calls that a body which is endowed with some sensible quality. Many of these sensible qualities can be removed from the body in such a way that it remains a body nevertheless. For even if a body lacks colour, odour, taste, it is still called a body. . . . Therefore those qualities that can be seen, heard, tasted, and smelled may be rejected as not at all constitut- ing the nature of a body ... It remains therefore to seek some sensible quality which occurs in all bodies and only in bodies and by which men may distinguish body from nonbody, as if by a criterion. Beyond any doubt this is mass or anti- typy, together with extension . . . Therefore we can assume nothing in bodies which does not follow from the definition of extension and antitypy. But from</page><page sequence="3">90 John J. Macintosh Boyle4, and Locke5, not all of whom are as careless as Galileo about con- trasting generic terms such as shape with more specific ones such as red, though none of them take up the point that, on this doctrine as stated, particular shapes such as triangular are examples of secondary qualities. At this stage, the doctrine seems to be a doctrine of groups of qualities, and the distinction is between those groups, some member of which must always apply, and those groups of which this is not true. To anticipate: not all qualities fall easily, or at all, into such groups. (2) Among the earliest distinctions is also the most obscure: secondary qualities are in the mind, primary qualities are not. This distinction is also offered by Galileo, who, in common with many early writers, seemed to think of it as either a restatement of, or a simple corollary of, the first dis- tinction, though quite simple scientific terms like 'is an acid' or 'is magnetic' (two examples of Campbell's6) serve to separate the two, since it looks very like grasping at straws to claim that there is some group of which 'is an acid' is a member, some other member of which applies to, for example, stones or electrons. This distinction can also be found in, e.g., Hobbes7 and Berkeley8, though Berkeley, of course, thought that one of the two classes it yields was empty. This doctrine is sometimes attributed to Locke, but the often careless Locke seems not, in fact, to be guilty of this confusion : whatever the other drawbacks of the qualities/ideas/powers terminology, it helps out here. (Essay, 2. 8. 15 shows Locke dealing adequately with the point at issue.) As before, we may let Galileo state the case: these concepts are derived only magnitude, figure, situation, number, mobility, etc. Motion itself is not derived from them. Hence there is no motion, strictly speaking, as a real entity in bodies. . . . Hence it is clear that the explanation of all qualities and changes must be found in magnitude, figure, motion, etc., and that heat, colour, etc., are merely subtle motions and figures." 4 See quotation given for distinction (11). 5 Locke, Essay, 2.8.9: "Qualities thus considered in bodies are: First, such as are utterly inseparable from the body, in what state soever it be; such as in all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be used upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less than to make itself singly to be perceived by our senses. . . . These I call . . . primary qualities ..." β Keith Campbell, Primary and Secondary Qualities, in: Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 1972. 7 Hobbes, De Corpore, 4.25.10: "...the object of sight, properly so called, is neither light nor colour, but the body itself which is lucid, or enlightened, or coloured. For light and colour, being phantasms of the sentient, cannot be accidents of the object." - And cp. 2.8.3 8 Berkeley, Principles, 10: "...extension, figure, and motion, abstracted from all other qualities, are inconceivable. Where, therefore the other sensible qualities are, there must these be also, to wit, in the mind and nowhere else."</page><page sequence="4">Primary and Secondary Qualities 91 " . . .1 think that tastes, odours, colours, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is concerned, and that they reside only in the consciousness."9 (3) We can distinguish, shakily, between qualities which are caused and those which are uncaused, and may themselves be thought of as causes. We might decide - with Locke, who often forgot his decision - that only the causing qualities are real, the others being only ideas, but such exciting sub-classifications into real and non-real are not necessary to our present enterprise. Alternatively, the primary qualities, though not themselves causes, are those qualities in virtue of which the substance in question can effect changes in other objects (such as people, wood, wax). Locke is as clear about this as he is anywhere in 2.23.7-10. It's a distinction which can also be found in Galileo10, Hobbes11, Descartes12, and Newton. New- ton writes: « * . . .if at any time I speak of Light and Rays as coloured or endued with Colours, I would be understood to speak not philosophically and properly, but grossly, and accordingly to such Conceptions as vulgar People in seeing these Experiments would be apt to frame. For the Rays to speak properly are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain Power and Disposition to stir up a Sensation of this or that Colour."13 (4) Primary qualities - a generalization, this, of the preceding, and less tied to a particular theory of perception - are the fundamental qualities, the ones which explain. I have suggested elsewhere14 that Bacon may have had this distinction in mind in parts of the New Organon, and it is clear enough in Leibniz and Boyle15. Here is Leibniz on the matter: "Imagine that some angel wished to explain to us how bodies are made heavy; he could achieve nothing by speaking, however beautifully, about a substantial 9 Galileo, op. cit., p. 274. 10 ibid., p. 276: "To excite in us tastes, odours, and sounds I believe that nothing is required in external bodies except shapes, numbers, and slow or rapid movements." 11 Hobbes, op. cit., 4.25.10: "The phantasm, which is made by hearing, is sound; by smell, odour, by taste, savour, and by touch, hardness and softness, heat and cold, wetness, oiliness, and many more, which are easier to be distingu- ished by sense than words. . . . these phantasms [are] effects in the sentient, as subject, produced by objects working upon the organs. . ." 12 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, 4.198: "We therefore must on all counts conclude that the objective external realities that we designate by the words light, colour, odour, flavour, sound, or by names of tactile qualities such as beat and cold,. . . . are not recognisably anything other than the powers that objects have to set our nerves in motion in various ways ..." 13 Newton, Opticks, Bk. 1, pt. 2, Definition. 14 in Francis Bacon, in: R. Harre (ed), Early Seventeenth Century Science and Scientists. 15 See quotation given for distinction (12)</page><page sequence="5">92 John J. Macintosh form, or sympathy, or other things of this kind. Rather he would only then satisfy our curious understanding when he gave us an explanation, sufficiently understood which, when we have comprehended it, will enable us to demonstrate with geo- metric certainty that gravity must necessarily arise from it. This angel must, therefore, necessarily present only such things as we can perceive distinctly. But we perceive nothing distinctly in matter save magnitude, figure, and motion."16 Why does it look red? someone asks, and we reply in terms of primary qualities. Why does it look square? someone asks, and unless the situation is abnormal, the answer is because it is square. (5) Some qualities, said Descartes and, as we have just seen, Leibniz, are intelligible, are clearly and distinctly perceived; others are not. "When pain, colour, and so on, are judged to be realities existing outside our mind," wrote Descartes17, "their nature is quite unintelligible." And this intel- ligible/unintelligible distinction was used by them to generate the usual lists. (6) Some of our ideas resemble the qualities in the object; others do not. Descartes is slightly more cautious than others : "...there are many. . .characteristics (size, shape, number, etc.) about which we clearly perceive that they appear to sensation or intellection just as they are, or at any rate could be, in the objects."18 Locke19 and Berkeley20 agree that this is a (i.e., 'the') distinction, though again Berkeley thinks (partly because of his views on what ideas can resemble) that it yields only one group of qualities. Berkeley's point was always that the distinction couldn't (workably) be made because the test(s) always put every quality into the secondary quality pigeonhole, but 16 Leibniz, On the Elements of Natural Science, and cp. The Confession of Nature Against Atheists: "...we must agree with those contemporary philosophers who have revived Democritus and Epicurus and whom Robert Boyle aptly calls corpuscular philosophers, such as Galileo, Bacon, Gassendi, Descartes, Hobbes, and Digby, that, in explaining corporeal phenomena, we must not unnecessarily resort to God or to any other incorporeal thing, form, or quality . . . but that, so far as can be done, everything should be derived from the nature of body and its primary qualities - magnitude, figure, and motion." 17 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy ; 1.68. 18 ibid. 1.70. 19 Locke, Essay, 2.8.15: ". . .the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are re- semblances of them, and their patterns do really exist in the bodies themselves; but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all." 20 Berkeley, Dialogue I: "Phil. . . . how can that which is sensible be like that which is insensible? Can a real thing in itself invisible be like a colour; or a real thing which is not audible be like a sound? In a word, can anything be like a sensation or idea, but another sensation or idea? . . . Hy. ... I find it impossible ... to conceive or understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea."</page><page sequence="6">Primary and Secondary Qualities 93 he didn't, apparently, doubt that it was one and the same distinction that was being called upon throughout. It is worth noticing that Leibniz, too, came to the view that there are only secondary qualities: "Concerning bodies I can demonstrate that not merely light, heat, colour, and similar qualities are apparent but also motion, figure, and extension."21 (7) Some qualities can be perceived by several senses, others only by one. Descartes22 and Leibniz found this difference exciting since they thought that it entailed or perhaps simply underlay the distinction offered earlier as (5) between intelligible and unintelligible qualities, a distinction which was thought by Leibniz at least to give rise in turn to our distinction (4). Berkeley, as is well known, was concerned to deny that any quality could be perceived by more than one sense. Leibniz writes: " . . .attributes common to several senses are to be regarded as distinct in compari- son with others, for they are not resolvable into confused ones, and then again into those dependent upon the senses, but into concepts attained by the intellect. Such attributes are magnitude, position, duration, and motion. We need not wonder at this, for, since they are common to several senses, they do not depend upon the particular constitution of a sense organ..."23 (8) Keith Campbell has written, "The doctrine of primary and secondary qualities . . . takes the world of material objects to be real, and distinguishes, as primary, those qualities and relations which belong to objects as they are in themselves, independent of human existence or nature."24 As I understand them, Descartes25 and Locke26 and, with the usual proviso, 21 Leibniz, On the Method of Distinguishing Real from Imaginary Phenomena, I have discussed this and other parallels between Leibniz and Berkeley at greater length in Leibniz and Berkeley ' in: PAS, 1970-71. 22 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy , 4.200: "These facts are observable not just by one sense but by several - by sight, touch, and hearing; moreover, our imagination and conception of them is distinct. The same does not apply to other sensible qualities such as colour and sound; they are not observed by several senses, but each by one sense only; and the images of them in our consciousness are always confused, and we are ignorant of their real nature." 23 Leibniz, On the Elements of Natural Science. 24 op. cit. p. 221. 25 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, 1.69: "This point is specially clear from a consideration of the vast difference, as regards our knowledge of their real nature, between, on the one hand, the size, shape, motion, position, duration, number, etc., of a visible body - the properties that I have said we clearly perceive in bodies - and, on the other hand, colour, painfulness, odour, flavour, and any other such characteristics of the body in question, which I have said are to be referred to sensation." 26 Locke, Essay, 2.8.23: "The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest of their [bodies] solid parts . . . are in them, whether we perceive them or not..."</page><page sequence="7">94 John J. Macintosh Berkeley27, find this a felicitous distinction, too. Campbell's own, sharper, distinction will be given later. (9) Some qualities are universal in fact, others are not. This is merely the factual version of distinction (1), but it seems not to have surfaced before Boyle28. It is to be found in Locke29 and Newton, in conjunction, in the case of Locke, with distinction (1). Newton derives this universality from the fact that the qualities in question "are to be found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments," and, expanding on the point, makes it clear that, for him, even so apparently conceptual a tie as that between body and extension is to be considered an empirical matter: "We in no other way know the extension of bodies than by our senses, nor do these reach it in all bodies; but because we perceive extension in all that are sensible, therefore we ascribe it universally to all others also."30 At this time, incidentally, he thought these qualities to be "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility and inertia." Later he offered a very similar list for slightly different reasons: "All these things being consider'd, it seems probable to me that God in the Be- ginning form' d Matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable Particles, of such Sizes and Figures, and with such other Properties, and in such Proportion to Space, as most conduced to the End for which he form'd them. . ."31 (10) Here is another, and interesting, distinction, which Locke and Boyle at least, take to be equivalent to (8). Among others, Peter Geach (in God and the Soul) has pointed out the distinction between what he calls Cambridge changes and real changes, while pointing out at the same time that neither he nor anyone of whom he knows has succeeded in making the distinction clear. Some philosophers believe that this is because there is no distinction here. If there is, it goes, roughly, as follows : a Cambridge change comes about when any proposition about an entity changes its truth value; a change that is merely &amp; Cambridge change comes about when a claim that was correct becomes incorrect without it being the case that the object has been in physical interaction with its environment; alternatively, when a claim that was correct becomes incorrect although the only interaction with the environment involves quite different qualities. Thus: "Philip," someone says, "is the best philosopher in the room," and then Philippa walks in. Well, there has been no (real) change in Philip, 27 See Principles, 9. Since for Berkeley there are no objects "in themselves" there are, once again, no primary qualities. 28 Boyle, The Systematical or Cosmical Qualities of Things: "... magnitude, shape, and motion . . . are the primitive modes and catholick affections of matter itself." 29 Locke, Essay 2.8.9 See note 5 above. 30 Newton, Principia, Rules of Reasoning in Natural Philosophy, Rule III. 31 Newton, Opticks, Q. 31.</page><page sequence="8">Primary and Secondary Qualities 95 but something that was true of him no longer is. Or, if you like, he has lost one property and gained another (that of being the second best philosopher in the room, perhaps). Both Locke and Boyle suggest that the properties whose changes are merely Cambridge changes are secondary. Whether they are right or not, about this, it's an interesting distinction, and one that I, for one, would like to know more about. Locke sometimes makes this point in terms that suggest that he thought it to be a matter of perceptual variability, as Berkeley charged, and perhaps he did think this sometimes, but he is, on occasion at least, more fortunate in his phrasing: "Pound an almond, and the clear white colour will be altered into a dirty one, and the sweet taste into an oily one. What real alteration can the beating of the pestle make in any body, but an alteration of the texture of it?"32 Boyle writes: ' . . . though the modern goldsmiths and refiners reckon amongst the most distinguishing qualities of gold, by which men may be certain of its being true and sophisticated, that it is easily dissoluble in aqua regis, and that aqua fortis will not work upon it; yet these attributes are not in the gold any thing distinct from its peculiar texture, nor is the gold we have now of any other nature than it was in Pliny's time, when aqua fortis and aqua regis had not been found out (at least in these parts of the world) and were utterly unknown to the Roman goldsmiths. And this example I have the rather pitched upon, because it affords me an opportun- ity to represent, that unless we admit the doctrine I have been proposing, we must admit, that a body may have an almost infinite number of new real entities accuring to it without the intervention of any physical change in the body itself."33 My aim in this paper is not, save in a very limited way, either exegetical or contributory, but we might nonetheless note in passing the apparent assumption that gold lacked the property of being soluble in aqua regis before the production of actual samples of aqua regis, and the unself- conscious treatment of gold as a body. The running together of mass and count nouns in this area is a 17th century commonplace, 'air' being the standard example. In fact, as we shall see (in (12)), Boyle is aware, as he hints, that his treatment of the matter allows us to see the merely termi- nological nature of the question, "did it or didn't it gain a new property?", even though the properties which tempt us to ask such a question may nonetheless be clearly distinct from the properties about which we are not tempted to ask such questions. (11) Some qualities are relational, some are not. Boyle notes that: "... if we should conceive that all the rest of the universe were annihilated, except any of these intire and individed corpuscles. . .it is hard to say what could be attributed to it, besides matter, motion (or rest), bulk, and shape . . . But now there being actually in the universe great multitudes of corpuscles mingled 32 Locke, Essay, 2.8.20. 33 Boyle, On the Origin of Forms and Qualities.</page><page sequence="9">96 John J. Macintosh among themselves, there arise... two new accidents. . .namely. . .posture and order. . .And when many corpuscles do so convene together as to compose any distinct body, as a stone, or a metal, then from their other accidents (or modes) and from these two last mentioned, there doth emerge a certain disposition or contrivance of parts in the whole, which we may call the texture of it."34 (12) Boyle goes on to single out a particular kind of relational quality, namely, those which are dispositional. He writes: Ί do not deny but that bodies may be said in a very favourable sense to have those qualities we call sensible, though there were no animals in the world: for a body in that case may differ from those bodies which are now quite devoid of such quality, in its having such a disposition of its constituent corpuscles, that in case it were duly applied to the sensory of an animal, it would produce such a sensible quality which a body of another texture would not. . . And thus snow, though if there were no lucid body nor organ of sight in the world, it would exhibit no colour at all ... yet it hath a greater disposition than coal or soot, to reflect store of light outwards, when the sun shines upon them all three. And so we say, that a lute is in tune whether it be exactly played upon or no, if the strings be all so duly stretched as that it would appear to be in tune, if it were played upon. But ... if there were no sensitive beings those bodies that are now the objects of our senses would be but dispositively, if I may so speak, endowed with colours, tastes, and the like; and actually but only with those more catholick affections of bodies, figure, motion, texture, etc."35 (13) Newton thought that the way to turn (9), factual universality, into (1), conceptual universality, was to add a distinction between those qualities "which admit neither intensification nor remission of degrees,"36 and those which do. (14) Distinction (13), in combination with the universal-in-fact distinc- tion will yield, he says, the result that qualities thus picked out are essen- tial. So, for example, gravity (whatever its ultimate explanation may prove to be: this is not a fundamental/non-fundamental distinction) is universal, but since gravitational attraction diminishes as bodies move apart, i.e., since gravity allows of intensification and remission of degrees, gravity is not an essential quality of bodies. Thus Newton in Rule III, Book III of the Principia, in the Advertisement to the 1717 edition of the Opticks, and, consistently, to Bentley: "You sometimes speak of gravity as essential and inherent to matter. Pray do not ascribe that notion to me. . ,"37 We might also consider, in such a context, though nobody seems to have done so, the distinction between those qualities which are such that, if a body has them, it necessarily has them, i.e., qualities 0 such that (x) (Bx &amp; 0x ■=&gt; L0x) 34 op. cit. 35 op. cit. 86 Newton, Principia, Rule III. 37 Newton to Bentley, 1963, quoted H. G. Alexander, Intro., Clarke- Leibniz Correspondence.</page><page sequence="10">Primary and Secondary Qualities 97 and qualities of which this is not true, which yields a distinction very like the first, conceptually-tied, distinction we considered. They are, however, distinct, for distinction (1) may be represented as a means of picking out those qualities 0 which are such that L(x) (Bx 3 0x) and this is a different matter. (15) There is a distinction between determinable and determinate qualities which is sometimes invoked as if it were important in this area and which, with a slight addition, gives the sort of split that people seem to like. Indeed, some of the remarks concerning it make it seem suspiciously like our (9). Reginald Jackson writes: "To mark a distinction to which reference has already been made, we shall use the terms "determinate qualities" and "indeterminate qualities". An example of the former is "equilateral triangularity", of the latter, "shape". It will be seen that determinateness admits of degrees . . . We shall reckon among determinate qual- ities all qualities not common to all bodies."38 It might be suggested that this will yield a doctrine of the traditional kind if we make primary all those qualities which are determinations of some indeterminate quality or other, secondary those which are not. (16) That primary qualities are tactile qualities, secondary qualities those which are not, is a suggestion that is scarcely ever made in an unabashed way. However, in Leibniz, tactile qualities are the last of the sensible qualities to be explained away39, while in Berkeley they are the most re- sistant to mental ingestion40. The list one gets by using such a distinction is not unlike the lists one gets by using the other distinctions we are looking at, provided, as always, that the examples used are chosen with sufficient care or laziness. (17) With this distinction, due, like the next, to J. J. C. Smart, we move into the present. Primary qualities are those qualities which are describ- able independently of any assumptions about the sensory apparatus of the audience. If we get in touch with rational entities on some distant planet or other, and gradually build up a common language with them the quality words in that language will be primary quality words, not secondary quality words : "Extraterrestrial beings could be expected to have a similar concept of length or electric charge to ours, but we would not expect their colour concepts, suppos- ing that they had any, to correspond to ours in any simple manner."41 38 R. Jackson, Locke's Distinction between Primary and Secondary Qualities^ in: Mind, 1929, p. 65. 39 Leibniz to Thomasius: ". . .those qualities that can be seen, heard, tasted, and smelled may be rejected as not at all constituting the nature of a body. The problem is thus reduced to the tactile qualities." 40 See Berkeley, New Theory of Vision, 41 J. J. Smart, Philosophy and Scientific Realism, p. 84. 7</page><page sequence="11">98 John J. Macintosh (18) There are not two neat packets, primary and secondary. Rather there is a gradation of qualities, from those which are severely anthropo- centric to those which are not so at all. Thus (Smart again): ". . .our sense of hot and cold ... is less anthropocentric than our colour sense because the human being is much more like an (inefficient) thermometer than he is like an (inefficient) spectrometer . . . Our sense of sound is less closely related to physical properties than our temperature sense, but is more closely related than is our visual sense."42 Clearly we might, if we cared to, generate a traditional list using this distinc- tion. (19) Primary qualities are those qualities which are useful and necessary in physics, secondary qualities are those qualities which are not, a suggestion of David Armstrong's: ". . .secondary qualities . . . may be defined (a little roughly) as those properties of physical phenomena, or ostensible properties of physical phenomena, that physicists make no appeal to in their attempts to explain the way the world behaves."45 And again, "those properties the physicist finds necessary to bestow . . . may be called the primary properties."44 (20) A complicated and interesting distinction, this, due to Bennett45, who suggests that something of this nature is part of what Locke was striving for. Too briefly: secondary qualities are those in which error is mere statistics ; primary qualities those which the individual can investigate by him/herself. I look at two objects and wonder if they are the same colour (they both look, perhaps, a particular shade of grey). The way to find out if they are the same colour (i.e., the way to find out if I'm colour blind) is to ask other people. (Paradigmatically, that is; investigation via light waves may also be possible, but only if I know what colour correlations most people make in the conditions in question.) But the way to find out if two boxes (say) are as vastly different in size as they appear to be is to try putting one inside the other. If the apparently larger one fits easily inside the other then, without consulting other people, I know I've gone wrong. I could, of course, first try out some hypothesis or other about boxes changing size when I put them together. But this would have many (to put it mildly) ramifications for my general view of the world: all sorts of scientific laws would no longer hold. And this too is in contrast with the first case. So 42 ibid., p. 85. 43 D. Armstrong, The Secondary Qualities, in: ATP, 1968, p. 225. 44 ibid., p. 227. 45 J. Bennett, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Central Themes. David Armstrong comes close to Bennett's point in Perception and the Physical World, p. 182, but drifts away from it by means of an ingenious but misplaced analogy between colour charts and rulers.</page><page sequence="12">Primary and Secondary Qualities 99 whether I wriggle (adopt new and startling hypotheses to explain my apparent error) or simply accept (as a result of my experiment) that I was wrong about the boxes' sizes in the first place, there is a sharp difference between this case and the colour case. And that difference is, if you like, the difference between primary and secondary qualities. (21) Keith Campbell's suggestion: "Quality Ρ is primary if and only if all and only those objects which are Ρ display a distinctive pattern of behaviour in interaction with the inanimate environ- ment."46 This is an interesting suggestion which, with the usual cases gives the usual results. Further, unlike many, it deals competently and plausibly with scientific ascriptions such as 'is migratory' or 'is accelerating' in a way which clearly reveals its worth as a distinction in the philosophy of science. Still, there are attributions which it seems to deal less than happily with. Consider, for example, 'is poisonous', or 'is the Queen of England'. The latter comes out as clearly primary, while the former comes out, I expect, as secondary. (22) Finally, let us notice the distinction between those qualities which are quantifiable, and those which are not or are, at any rate, less obviously, so. None of the 17th century authors known to me have said that this is the primary/secondary quality distinction, but others have been willing to say that they said it was, and it is, anyway, an obvious enough distinc- tion to be in our list. Gillespie claims that: ". . .it epitomizes Galileo's lifelong position that it should have been he who distinguished between primary and secondary qualities in bodies. The primary he defined as properties essential to metrical description - length, width, weight, figure. The secondary - colour, taste, odour, texture - are those which are modes of perception in us rather than real essences permeating matter. The difference is that between object and subject."47 It is not, I think, particularly interesting in this context that Galileo says nothing about the rather mind boggling notion of "real essences permeating matter". By way of a reminder and summary, here is a table setting out the corres- pondences between the people and distinctions already mentioned. Let me reemphasize some points. First, I am not suggesting that only these distinctions are to be found in the authors mentioned: any of them may give, or be willing to allow, others. Secondly, I am not suggesting that only these authors offer these distinctions: quite apart from the important and interesting 17th and 20th century authors I have ignored, it is noticeable that I have leapt from the early 18th century to the second quarter of the twentieth without even a passing glance at the intervening period.

Sometimes they were, and thought that there was a relation of entailment or mutual entailment between their distinctions, more often they seem simply to have assumed equivalence. But none of these ways are in fact equivalent. This may easily be tested by the reader. Quite simple terms like "is accelerating relative to some other object" will serve to fragment Locke's distinctions, while other, equally simple terms such as "is a manufactured article", or "is broken", or "is both red and square" cause difficulties that show up the vagueness of the tests. Clearly "is broken" is secondary on Locke's tests which I have numbered (1) and (9), but what about his (3), (6), and (8)? One doesn't, or at any rate, I don't, know what result is right here. One of the things that this highlights - a point always ignored in such discussions - is that many attributions - "is calloused", "is worn out", "is eroded" - make claims about an object's past, as well as its present, state. In view of the multiplicity of distinctions above, I shall now take it as obvious that the notion that there is a single primary/secondary quality distinction is an over-simplification. And, I suggest, whether we are inter- ested in primary/secondary quality discussions for philosophical or for historical reasons, it is a distorting over-simplification. That 17th century authors oversimplified in this confused manner is historically understandable, but we do them no service if we follow them in their</page><page sequence="14">Primary and Secondary Qualities 101 confusion. But what about the claim that no primary/secondary quality distinction can succeed? I remarked earlier that the lists of qualities produced were very short, and very similar. When I consider them I am reminded of a sign I once saw outside a shop in a small village in Wales. It read: "Butter, Eggs, Bed &amp; Breakfast, Woollen Goods, Souvenirs, Milk, Pop, Books, Etc." Like the bewildered character who plays so large a part in the Wittgenstein- ian corpus, I'm uncertain how to go on. Either the 'etc.* that goes on the end of the primary qualities list, combined with the 'etc' that goes on the end of the secondary qualities list, succeeds - as apparently it is meant to - in catching all the qualities, or it doesn't. If it doesn't, I'm in the dark about the point of such a distinction ; if it does, I'm bewildered by my inability to decide in real cases what goes where. Sometimes I am clear enough about these matters. For example, if 'is unbuttoned" is a quality then it is clear that on our first, Galilean, test, the conceptual one, cis unbuttoned' is secondary, for I can imagine objects that are not unbuttoned (and not buttoned, either). But my idea of the un- buttonedness of my garment seems as accurately to resemble its unbuttoned- ness as any idea does any quality, so on that test it is primary. Concensus is not required, and it makes a difference to my garment's interaction with the inanimate world. It's not in the mind, and it's not a power; nor does it explain the occurrence of other qualities. So, although different tests give different results, the notion of being unbuttoned seems at least clear enough to give a result. But some qualities, including some of the traditional ones, are not. I'm very unclear about the shape of an object, for example, and not much clearer about its texture, or its solidity. "We know far more evidently what shape is," wrote Descartes, "than what colour is, as inherent in the body."48 Well, maybe, but perhaps that's not saying very much. Here is Austin on shape: ". . .coins in fact are rather special cases. For one thing their outlines are well- pefined and very highly stable, and for another they have a known and a name- able shape. But there are plenty of things of which this is not true. What is the real shape of a cloud? And if it be objected, as I dare say it could be, that a cloud is not a 'material thing* and so not the kind of thing which has to have a real shape, consider this case : what is the real shape of a cat ? Does its real shape change whenever it moves ? If not, in what posture is its real shape on display? Furthermore, is its real shape such as to be fairly smooth - outlined, or must it be finely enough serrated to take account of each hair ? It is pretty obvious that there is no answer to these questions - no rules according to which, or procedures by which, answers are to be determined. Of course, there are plenty of shapes which the cat definitely is not - cylindrical, for instance. But only a desperate man would toy with the idea of ascertaining the cat's real shape 'by elimination'".49 48 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, 1.69. 49 Austin, Sense and Sensibilia, p. 67.</page><page sequence="15">102 John J. Macintosh The more one thinks of the matter, indeed, the more it seems that, for most attributions, most of the tests give no clear result. Part, though only part, of the trouble with the primary/secondary quality distinction is that it is never made clear what, exactly, a quality is. It can't be, can it, that qualities are simply those things we attribute to subjects in typical subject- predicate assertions? Because here is a list, more or less at random, of commonplace remarks, and the predicate terms in it don't seem to fit at all happily into the primary/secondary boxes : 2 is the only even prime this rock is eroded he was in a blind rage he was subject to fits of depression Eohippus evolved into our present day horse my biscuit is soggy his expression was angry his manner was suspicious pens are manufactured articles William had a fit of the vapours I'm hungry the battle marked a turning point in the course of the campaign the pond froze twice last winter the wire is live the mountains look on Marathon her hands were red and calloused our galaxy contains more stars than its nearest neighbour Now, of course, not all of these remarks are remarks about bodies, and it may be that the doctrine of primary and secondary qualities is a doctrine about bodies. But since bodies seem to be just those entities that have the preferred qualities - stones, but not their reflections; long- bows, but not rainbows - we are in considerable danger of being trapped in a vicious circle at this point. In the 17th century it sometimes seemed to be a doctrine about elementary particles, or corpuscles, and when Newton got a more atomic notion going, the doctrine seemed to be about New- tonian atoms. But if that's what the doctrine is about, it's out of business for the simple but sufficient reason that it no longer has a subject matter. We are, to put it shortly, owed a doctrine of qualities as a prerequisite to a doctrine of primary and secondary qualities, for the intelligibility of the one presupposes the explicability of the other. But I know of no such doctrine. Here is another point. Attempting to play as fair as I could in the be- ginning, I set up all the distinctions so that there would indeed be one distinction involved in each case. But this means that one class is always the mere residue of the other, and there is no reason to think - indeed quite the opposite - that in any of our distinctions there will be even the slightest degree of homogeneity about this residue set. In fact, even if we</page><page sequence="16">Primary and Secondary Qualities 103 can say what qualities are, we should expect, if we expect anything, that there will be many groupings, not just two. And in fact, I think, that is a result that comes out of this paper. For what we have exhibited is a cluster of groupings, some interesting, some dull, some helpful, some unhelpful, some out of date, some of contemporary interest, and so on. For example, there is the distinction between those attributions that fit, more or less easily, into a genus/species hierarchy, and those which do not. If my coat is blue, then it is coloured; and if it is col- oured then it is some specific colour or combination of colours. But if it is grubby, or torn, or out of fashion, then there need be no higher or lower hierarchical term available. Doubtless it is, in some sense, a matter of its "texture" or its "shape" whether or not it is grubby or torn, but pushing texture or shape into such a semantic position would never occur to someone not in the grip of a dogma. Much of what gives plau- sibility to some of the distinctions considered earlier is the notion that there is always a determinable genus term for each determinate species term: not all things are triangular? - no, but they all (or all the interesting ones) have shape (supposedly), and triangularity is a species of shape. But not all terms are interrelated in this way, nor is there any reason why they should be. That's one, interesting, distinction; I'm not sure how useful it is. More useful is Campbell's point that there is a distinction to be made (in terms of explanatory potential) between fundamental and consequential terms. That something is magnetic may be a consequence of its being something else, and that is doubtless important, but has, as Campbell points out, little to do witli questions such as the term's usefulness to physicists or its marking its bearer as having a distinctive interaction pattern with the inanimate. Again, there is the distinction made by Boyle between those ascriptions, the unpacking of which involves an 'if ... then . . . ' construction, and those ascriptions, the unpacking of which does not. Yet again, there is a distinc- tion, straightforward but worth making, between relational and non- relational ascriptions. All these distinctions, in short, are or may be à propos and helpful in some contexts; irrelevant or misleading in others. We should ask, with respect to each primary/secondary quality distinc- tion: what is (or was, for past needs need not be present ones) the point of making it? If the point is, e.g., to separate out just those qualities that are necessary for science then let us be honest with ourselves and follow Armstrong into distinction (6) above, or rather, into a suitably expanded version of it. But let us also eschew the pretence that that distinction has any a priori worth or backing. In a more specifically philosophical area, we might envisage the follo- wing: someone might decide that some version of phenomenalism was tempting, but be daunted by the difficulty of translating rather short</page><page sequence="17">104 John J. Macintosh contingent statements about objects into rather long (i.e., infinite) necessary statements about properties, and decide to look for some favoured set of properties in terms of which all the rest could be accounted for. And then he would, doubtless, be interested in investigating Bacon's distinction, our number (4). Once we have decided what kind of attributions interest us in a partic- ular area, or for a particular purpose, and how they are to be picked out, then we may find interesting distinctions, including perhaps some of the ones noticed here, but until we have established these preliminary stages, no worthwhile results can be expected. The discussion about primary and secondary qualities got as far as it did, and has lasted as long as it has, because of, apparently, a tacit agreement among the participants that these preliminaries had been taken care of. The discussion has been as incon- clusive as it has, in part, because these preliminaries have not, in fact, been resolved. Once they are, we may find a variety of useful distinctions. But there is no reason to think that actual past discussions will provide a reason for picking out one of them as the primary/secondary quality distinction. In short, here as elsewhere in philosophy, we should let our distinctions wait upon our requirements, and not pretend that distinctions lie about in the world just waiting to be caught in the field of our philosophical microscope, all previous users of which suffered, unfortunately, from nerv- ous tremors of the focusing hand.</page></plain_text>
