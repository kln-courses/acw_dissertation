<plain_text><page sequence="1">The S&amp;mkhya Karika of Thvaraktrsna. By RADIHA- NATH PHUKAN. Pp. 165. Calcutta: FIRMA K. L. MUKHOPADHYAY, 1960. This is hardly a translation of the Sdmkhya- karikas but, as the author says, " practically a new rendering." Indeed it is, being an attempt to combine the authority of "modern science" with the dialectics of Advaita to produce an interpreta- tion of Smkhya which is quite contrary to the usual one, though not without precedent among previous Advaita commentators on this text. Under these circumstances it is beside the point to cavil with the readings of the kdrikas themselves word for word; the rendering is consistent with others but inserts much additional English to justify the special interpretation here offered. There are occasional direct perversions of the sense of the Sanskrit in the cause of Phukan's thesis (e.g., on "tatha ca" in the eleventh karika; see below), but one would be missing the point if one did not meet the author's claims in the spirit in which they are offered. "The issue," he writes in his preface, "is (1) whether the Sruikhya Phi- losophy is atheistic and without a clear meaning; or (2) whether it is a precisely scientific treatise on 'Psycho-Physics for God-realization."' The answer to (1) is "no," to (2) "yes," according to Phukan. It is, of course, quite possible that we have lost the meaning of Isvarakrsna's system; the interpre- tation usually accepted nowadays makes it out to be unsatisfactory philosophy, failing to justify itself against obvious objections, appealing to anthropomorphic analogies instead of offering arguments, and promulgating a peculiarly un- stable sort of dualistic realism. We should wel- come a fresh attempt at interpreting Tsvarakrsna's text, and Phukan's reading may well come as a surprise to many students of the subject. As a result, despite the difficulties in his arguments which I want to indicate below, it would be a mistake to disregard this book entirely. Too much work in Indian philosophy nowadays is re-pre- sentation of interpretations already too often pre- sented; we need more " new renderings." The author is therefore to be congratulated for having raised again philosophical issues of consequence. Yet this reviewer remains entirely unconvinced of the interpretation offered. It is possible I was put off by the authorities appealed to as spokesman for "modern science": perhaps it is predictable- they are that well-known pair, Eddington and Jeans! Writers with stranger theses than Phu- kan's have found justification in those romantic pages. But Phukan is not content merely to claim scientific sanction for S5mkhya; he offers other arguments as well. There are at least 5 specific interpretations offered which run counter to the usual reading of the text. (1) There is ultimately only one purucsa for Isvarakrsna, says Phukan. "Ultimately," i. e., before " creation " (the beginning of the S5,mkhya " evolution "), purusa and prakrti are indistin- guishable; the plurality which Tsvarakrsniia unmis- takably asserts in krilkc 18 is the plurality of purusas after creation has begun. If we are to speak about the situation before creation, we'll have to speak of "the Purusa " (28). The puman of karitkd 11 constitutes a reference by Tsvarakrsna to this ultimately single Purusa.' (85) However, strictly speaking, to talk of either one or many purusa(s) in the primal state is misleading, since the conception of plurality presupposes a system of space, and at this stage there is neither time nor space. (29) Furthermore, Samkhya has excellent reasons for accepting neither monism nor plural- ism, since its purpose is precisely to educate the seeker from a belief in pluralism to a belief in monism; thus its wisest position is an indetermi- nate one. (63) Counter-considerations are these, however. Ka- 1 Here and elsewhere Phukan invokes the authority of the commentator Gaudapada. Consistently, however, this commentator's remarks are twisted to fit the Advaita interpretation. Does Phukan identify this commenta- tor's interpretation with the author of the Agamadstra?</page><page sequence="2">134 Journal of the American Oriental Society, 83.1 (1963) rika 18, which asserts the plurality of purusas, follows directly the 17th kIrikc, which asserts the existence of (at least one) puru~sa ("puruso-'sti"). And the arguments offered for the purusa. of 17 are clearly not intended to show that at least one human being exists, but rather that there is at least one basic entity (other than prakrti, for whom and by whom prakrti operates. It seems natural, then, to interpret 18 as speaking in the same framework, showing that not only is there at least one such entity but that there are in reality many of them. Furthermore, if 18 speaks of hu- man beings, rather than more ultimate entities, the arguments for plurality beg the question, since they assume the plurality they are supposed to be proving. And Phukan's translation does nothing to avert this conclusion. Secondly, the reading given to kdrika 11 by Phukan depends on a ques- tionable rendering of the phrase "tatha ca." Kariks 10 and 11 explain the categories of vyakta and avyakta, " evolved " and " unevolved." Kdrik&amp; 10 says that the "evolved" is caused, non-eternal, moble, many, has parts, etc., and that the "un- evolved" is viparitam, "opposed,"-opposed to all these descriptions, so both Phukan and other com- mentators have it.2 Karik 11 then says: trigunam, aviveki visayah samanyam acetanam prasavadharmi vyaktam tatha pradhenam tadviparitas tatha ca pumdn. This would seem to contrast pum&amp;n with both " evolved " and " unevolved," if we follow the usual interpretation. Indeed, we must read it this way if we take " tatha ca " in the last line to mean "and likewise" or "though similar," so that the last line says that the pumina, though like both the vyakta and avyakta (in some respects not men- tioned here), is opposed in the respects mentioned in the rest of the verse. It is then possible to make this consistent by adducing the respects men- tioned in the previous Writki as the respects in which the pumdn is like the vyakta and avyakta: it is uncaused, like avyakta, but many, like vyakta. This is a reconstruction, to be sure, but it seems prima facie plausible. Instead, Phukan wants us to read the passage in question as saying that the 21. 10: hetumat anityam avyapi sakriyam anekam Cthritam lingam savayavam paratantram vyaktam viparitam avyaktam. puman, being the reverse of pradhana (i. e., vyakta prakrti) in the respects mentioned, is avyakta "notwithstanding what has been said above (in Karika 3 . . .) ." "Notwithstanding what has been said above," he says, is "'the meaning" of the Sanskrit phrase "tath5, ca." I doubt that it is even a meaning. Even if it were, the linking of this k1rika with the third instead of the tenth which immediately precedes it seems to me to strain too far to justify the interpretation based upon it. Thirdly, the doctrine that there is no space in the avyakta state, by appeal to which criticism of this whole issue is made to appear out of point, is not to be found explicitly stated by Isvarakrssna, nor does Phukan explicitly claim to find it implied there. His references are to Ein- stein by way of Jeans, to Whitehead, to Vidyd- ran. ya's Paficadasf, an Advaita text, and to his own notes on karika 33, a passage which speaks of time, not of space, but which Phukan stretches to in- clude space on "scientific" grounds. (31-32) (2) Phukan claims that the avyakta includes both purwma and prakrti, not merely prakrti as is usually held. Arguments include: (a) that since "according to this (the third) Karika, Purusa, and primal Prakrti are both causeless (Ahetu- mat) " they are "for the reason of that, Avyakta of Kdrika 10" (74) ; (b) that since according to klarik 14 the "Vyakta is active (Sakriya) and therefore non-conscious . . . the Avyakta is with- out 'action' (Niskriya) and therefore . the conscious Seer itself." (36) ; (c) "Prakrti as such has never been termed Avyakta in the Sdmkhya" since in its five occurrences it means "the state before creation." (40, footnote 1). A sufficient answer to (a), of course, is that there are two ways for something to be "cause- less"; one is for it to be the sort of thing that might cause something but doesn't, the other is for it to be the sort of thing that couldn't possibly cause anything. In any case, the third karike doesn't use the expression " ahetumat." Argument (b) commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. As for (c), the question is: the state of what before creation? Phukan seems to think that since prakrti is first avyakta, then vyakta, it can't "as such" be called "avyakta." This is mystifi- cation through hypostatization. (3) Since avyakta includes purusa, says Phukan, avyakta is conscious (36). This com- pletes the exposition of the dialectic which is sup-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 135 posed to lead us to the conclusion that Samikhya purusa = Advaita brahman and Sdmkhya prakrti Advaita maya. Avyakta's consciousness is proved by (2b) above. The identification of prakrti with maya is justified by appeal to kdrikas 61 and 48. 61 is the famous passage about the bashful dancer: Phukan construes "sukumdrataram" as "that which can be easily understood." " In Karika 48" says Phukan "it has been distinctly said that to regard Prakrti as the ultimate reality is a sort of ignorance (Avidy5) " (48). The word "avidya" doesn't occur in the text; it is equated with tamas by Phukan. (4) S,7nkhya is not atheistic, according to Phukan, but it is not clear what he takes " theism" to involve. Apparently committal to a personal deity, which is the normal use of the term, is not in question, for he admits that Tsvarakrs~na does not have a God, but we are "not to infer that the Srmkhya is an atheistic philosophy." (51-52) Indeed, if we did we'd have to draw the same conclusion about 8amkara's Advaita (45). But "Neither 8amkaracarya nor Kapila was an atheist; both were Supertheists "! (45-46). (5) Finally, S7akhya holds, like " modern science," that "we see the mind" (65), that "the only objectivity is consciousness" (38), and that prakrti is therefore "an unreal category" (48). The grounds for this are strange: science tells that "we receive some electromagnetic vibrations which our mind turns into shapes, colours and attributes . . ." (65), and the 28th kltrika speaks of an indeterminate ilocana produced by objects on our sense-organs. The parallel is interesting, but where is the connection with the idealism announced? Phukan's conclusion is that the Setankhyakritkas take an apparent stance of realism but in fact teach Advaita. The apparent realism is intended to aid the seeker in realizing the truth of Advaita, indeed even a fatalistic dependence upon God (51). (This God is expressly denied to Saimkhya and Advaita, yet Phukan thinks it will not "be far too wrong to suppose that everything is ordained by God and that not a leaf can fall against his will.") It seems hard to believe that thoughtful people can be convinced by arguments of this sort, yet the number of Advaitins among thoughtful people in India and elsewhere gives one pause. Phukan's book is one more in a continuing tradition of attempts to Advaitize everyone else's theories. Ancient expositors of Advaita were cleverer than he, but their arguments too may in the last analysis be open to objections such as mine. Wherein, then, lie the attractions of Advaita; why is it so popular? Or is it merely an all-too-con- venient outlet for the irrationalism of disappointed would-be scientists? KARL H.
