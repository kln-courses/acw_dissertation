<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anticipating Nostalgia, Securing Annabelle Amy Robillard Whatever pain achieves, it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resistance to language. ?Elaine Scarry Whenever I call the vet's office to make an appointment for Annabelle, our eight-year-old black Lab mutt, or Wrigley, our three-year old black Lab mutt, I imagine that the minute the receptionist hangs up the phone, she says to the other receptionist, "It's that Robillard character again. I swear she's got Munchausen's by Proxy with those damn dogs." Lately, I've begun asking my husband to make the appointments. I imagine this because one of my biggest fears in life is that people will be able to see right through me to the raw, aching need that for so long defined me: the need for attention, for recognition, for someone to say to me, "I hear you; yes, you are important enough to be listened to." I recognize the vanity in my worry about the vet's receptionist and the Munchausen's. As though they care enough to be talking about which of their patients' owners needs the most attention. We all do. Every one of us is a sponge for the attention of others. Some of us get it from the day we're born. Some of us have to fight for it, nickel-and-dime others out of it, compete for such a small amount that when we finally do get some we wonder what all the fuss was about. I do call the vet's office a lot. A few months ago, I went in, dogless, to pick up a prescription for Annabelle. I grinned when I asked the receptionist if my suite was ready yet. I'd been in there at least three times in the last two weeks. Seemed only right that I should get my own room. Or some kind of plaque. jac 30.3-4 (2010)</page><page sequence="2">786 jac Annabelle is not a sickly dog. But I guess when you look at it as an outsider, you might say that the day I adopted her might have been a sign. My dear friend Paul's favorite moment on the day we picked up Annabelle from the SPCA in Syracuse was when I was filling out paperwork at the counter and Annabelle jumped up, front paws on the counter, and sniffed over what I was doing. Making sure I got things right, Paul says. My favorite memory of that day came when they delivered a booger-nosed, sixth-eight-pound black Lab mix into the small visiting room. The dog-who would-become-Annabelle was pulling, pulling, pulling on her leash, rushing toward us into the room. When the volunteer gave her a bit of slack, Annabelle promptly puked. It was at that moment that she became Annabelle for me. I felt a kind of kinship with her immediately. She had gotten herself all worked up about meeting us, and her response to this kind of excitement was to regurgitate her lunch. When I was a kid, I did the same thing. I still have a very weak stomach, and I get car-sick very easily (I do most of the driving in the relationship; Steve likes to be the passenger). My mother likes to tell about how I would get myself so worked up about going to the amusement park that she'd have to pull the car over on the side of the road so I wouldn't puke in the car. It got so she wouldn't tell me where we were going if she thought I'd be too excited about it. And now, thirty-some-odd years later, I have to wait until the last possible minute to tell Annabelle that she's got a friend coming over. She had kennel cough when I adopted her. When she sneezed, boogers went flying and stuck to the walls. But it was nothing that a healthy dose of antibiotics couldn't cure. Intellectually, I knew when I adopted her at just ten months old that she had many, many years of life to live and love to give. But if I'm honest with myself, I'll admit that from the day I adopted her I've been anticipating her death. I knew, and I still know, that her death will crush me. In some sick way maybe I'm convincing myself that I'm doing the right thing by anticipating her death, that in doing so I' 11 be better prepared when it does happen. But really what I'm hoping is that, maybe, somehow, if I anticipate her death now, if I grieve for her when she's still very much here and alive, she won't actually die. My grief now will prevent her death later. You'll have to put me in a rubber room when she dies, I say.</page><page sequence="3">Amy Robillard 787 Stick me in the bin for a couple weeks, I tell Steve. A part of me will die with her, I know. WWW I don't want to write about her after she's gone. I have a feeling I won't be able to write about her after she's gone. In writing about my relationship with Annabelle now, I recognize that I run the very real risk of intellectu alizing, of creating a distance where before there was none. Language does this. Putting the words on the page, recalling significant stories about my time with Annabelle allows me to begin the work of articulating the depth of my feeling for her, but it also threatens to change the relationship I have with her. This essay is an attempt to understand my relationship with Annabelle, a dog, a creature I love with every inch of my being, an animal I'd do anything to save, anything to keep happy. I'd do anything to prevent her from hurting. Perhaps this, then, is what this essay is doing: in working to understand my anticipatory grief for her loss, I prepare myself for that day when she will be hurting. I prepare myself to let her go, to resist burdening her with my suffering in her final moments. I write about her now, as she's sleeping in the next room, because I can afford to take the risks that language poses to my relationship with her. If language helps me articulate, it also threatens to objectify, to misrepre sent, to misrecognize. Theorizing about complex emotions such as grief and nostalgiadefamiliarizes the familiar and threatens to render Annabelle a mere vehicle for a complex understanding of emotion. Annabelle as method. Such a risk would be so much greater later, when she's gone. Right now, I can take a break and hug and kiss her and be with her in this moment. When she's gone, I will not be able to endure the distance academic writing creates. Since the publication in 1998 of Lynn Worsham's theoretical treatise, "Going Postal: Pedagogic Violence and the Schooling of Emotion," scholars in rhetoric and composition have spent a great deal of time and energy theorizing the consequences of Worsham's argument that if we</page><page sequence="4">788 jac are to effect social change, "our most urgent political and pedagogical task remains the fundamental reeducation of emotion" (216). The field has amassed a significant body of work dedicated to theorizing the ideological work of, for instance, disappointment(Micciche, "More"), shame (Bouson; Williams; Schell; DiLeo), resentment (Banning), teacher affect (Yoon; Micciche, Doing; Lindquist; Robillard), and, more generally, the concept of emotional labor (Zebroski; Gillam; Kerr). This work is remarkable for its collective ability to articulate aspects of our professional lives that so often go unremarked and, worse, unnoticed. Scholars in rhetoric and composition are working to consciously resist what Worsham identifies as dominant pedagogy's primary violence. Pedagogy binds each individual to the social world through a complex and often contradictory affective life that remains, for the most part, beyond the horizons of semantic availability, and its success depends on a mystification of this primary work. In particu lar, pedagogy provides and limits a vocabulary of emotion and, especially to those in subordinate positions, it teaches an inability to adequately apprehend, name, and interpret their affective lives. (223) This primary violence is not limited, of course, to our professional lives as teachers and writers; indeed, it is this limited vocabulary of emotion, the mystification of the primary violence of dominant pedagogy, that leads me to this investigation of the anticipatory emotions I experience for my beloved Annabelle. I recognize in myself an inability to articulate the depth of the emotion I feel about my dog, and I know that I'm not alone in this. Alice A. Kuzniar, in Melancholia's Dog, notes that for many people, "desire for closeness to a pet needs to be repudiated because it implies insufficiencies on one's own part, such as a maladjustment to social norms, as if the pet were a second-class replacement for human companionship or kinship and not something wholly different" (109). Kuzniar's project is a rhetorical one: of intimacy with and love for a dog; Kuzniar examines "what occurs when these affective feelings are disavowed and when the identification with the dog becomes the object of shame" (3). While it's true that I have a hard time articulating my feelings for Annabelle, I have</page><page sequence="5">Amy Robillard 789 little trouble repudiating those feelings. I was single when I adopted Annabelle, so it was easy to say of my relationship with her that it was filling a void that couldn't be met by other people. She was, alternately, my partner and my child, and the joy I experienced in loving her was actually quite perverse. When I met, then moved in with, and then married Steve, also a dog lover, we fit right into the cultural narrative of the childless couple substituting dogs for the children we really wanted but couldn't or wouldn't have. In Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs, Caroline Knapp cautions, Let on the depth of your true feelings about a dog?how attached you are, how vital the relationship feels?and you risk being accused of any number of neuroses: you're displacing human love onto the animal, which is perverse; you're anthropomorphizing, which is naive and unsophisticated; you're sublimating your unconscious wish for a baby or a spouse or a family into the dog, which is sad and pathetic. (12) The use of the very word "love" to describe one's feelings for a particular animal, Kennan Ferguson suggests, is unavoidable despite "a tenuous suspicion ... that the emotional affinity between humans and dogs does not measure up to the standards of true love, that the term itself connotes an intensity of emotion that might better be termed 'affection,' 'attach ment,' or 'fondness'" (378). That the very labeling of the relationship between humans and dogs generates responses that can only be charac terized as extreme?the defensive and the disgusted, let's say?suggests that dominant pedagogy has been wildly successful in fostering shame where we might otherwise feel pride. Is it possible to articulate dog love without also defending oneself against the charges of anthropomorphism and sublimation that are sure to follow? The reasons dog lovers point to when defending dog love circulate as widely as the shame-inducing narratives. We love dogs because they're loyal; they don't judge us; they don't care what we look like when we wake up in the morning; and they actually kinda like our morning breath. They offer unconditional love, a love that no human can ever offer another human. Dogs live in the moment; they're not worried about the future or living in the past. What matters is the here and now, and such an orientation</page><page sequence="6">790 jac to time stills us when we cannot escape our own worries about the future and our obsessions about the past. Both Marjorie Garber and Alice Kuzniar note the irony in attributing to dogs the best of human character istics. While Garber notes that "the dog becomes the repository of those model human properties that we have cynically ceased to find among humans" (15), Kuzniar wonders, "to what extent can the best of so-called human traits properly be cal led * human' when they apply quintessential ly to the dog?" (6). In his memoir, Dog Years, Mark Doty observes that one of the shame inducing narratives?that we who love dogs are really seeking a child substitute?may in fact help us articulate another reason for dog love: "Does everyone truly want a baby, or a baby substitute? The idea seems reductive. But the truth within it is that we are charmed by certain kinds of limitation: the dog's dependence, like that of the little child, engages rather than repels" (38). One kind of limitation that no doubt charms us is dogs' inability to observe themselves. Dogs do not see themselves from the perspective of the other. They are not, as Doty puts it, "split into subject and object" (43). Temple Grandin points to one consequence of this limitation: "Another big difference between animals and people is that animals probably don't have the complex emotions people do, like shame, guilt, embarrassment, greed, or wanting bad things to happen to people who are more successful than you" (90). Dogs can express their love for us without observing themselves expressing that love; they love us unselfconsciously. Perhaps this helps to explain, at least in part, why we so often attribute the best of human qualities to our canine companions. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson writes that "dogs do not lie to you about how they feel because they cannot lie about feelings" (31). Dogs' straightfor wardness with their feelings encourages the same in us; observing dogs' emotions calls into relief our own inhibitions and may, Masson hopes, persuade us to "learn to be as direct, as honest, as straightforward, and especially as intense in our feelings as dogs are" (4). With our dogs, we think?or hope?we can escape ideology and just feel. But the possibility of our loving our dogs unselfconsciously, without shame or apology, has been challenged by a dominant ideology that "works to mystify emotion as purely a personal and private matter; it actively conceals the fact that emotions are prevailing forms of social life, that so-called personal life</page><page sequence="7">Amy Robillard 791 always takes shape in social and cultural terms" (Worsham, "Coming" 106). WWW When I was sick as a kid, 1 was afraid to tell my mom. In the third grade, when the school nurse sent home a note about my crooked back, my mom threw the note away and told me, "Your back's not crooked, for Chrissakes." I remember one time when I was a teenager. I had a cold and I'd come downstairs to get some Dimetapp from the cabinet above the kitchen sink. When my mom saw what I was doing, she yelled at me for taking medicine that she'd bought for herself. "That's mine," she said. WWW For most of her life, Annabelle has had an on-and-off limp after she runs really hard. It's usually her front left foot, and it always seemed like it was her wrist that hurt her. I'd taken her in to the vet a few times over the years for this problem, and the doctor would prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication. After a few days on meds, Annabelle would be right back to herself. And we'd keep the rest of the pills for the next time she was hurting. This time was different. I'd set out on my nightly walk with Annabel le and Wrigley. We hadn' t made it all the way to the corner of our street when Annabelle began hopping on three legs. She wouldn't put any weight at all on her front left leg. I walked her back to the house as gently as I could? I think now, poor Wrigley, she thought she was starting out on a walk? and called the vet to see if she could see her right away. I was scared. I'd never seen my baby girl hopping on three legs before. There's nothing that upsets me more than seeing her hurt. I turn into a mess of emotions: fear indistinguishable from anger, anxiety indistinguishable from nausea indis tinguishable from a dull ache. Steve and Wrigley came with us to the vet. The whole family in the examining room, Wrigley rolling around on the floor getting tummy rubs from anyone who'd give them. Dr. Burks examined Belly and came up with nothing. To know anything, we'd have to do x-rays. But to do x-rays,</page><page sequence="8">792 jac she'd have to be sedated because she had to be put into awkward positions, and Belly's not so good with being handled that way. What dog is? I made an appointment for the following morning. Once she was sedated, Dr. Burks and a vet tech strapped her to a stretcher to carry her from the examin ing room to the x-ray room. I thought I couldn't bear to see her on a stretcher and told Dr. Burks as much. But I did look. I picked up her little foot and put it back on the stretcher so they could clear the door more easily. Told her I loved her. The elbow x-rays showed severe arthritis on the left and bad but not so-severe arthritis on the right. I didn't really understand what arthritis was, and I still don't, but when I saw the x-ray, I could see why it hurt so bad. Her elbow was a tangled mass of white. Bone that didn't belong, and elbow joints that weren't properly fused. I realize now that she must've been born with elbow dysplasia. Dr. Burks was worried about a small speckled spot in the bone of the left elbow. She pointed it outto me on the x-ray while Belly lay twenty feet away, sedated, held down by two vet techs. I knew that speckled means cancer. Steve's dog, Scully, had very recently died of cancer of the spleen, and we'd seen the x-rays. Dr. Burks had another vet in the office take a look at Belly's x-ray. He agreed that it was probably just a result of the severe arthritis, but it wouldn't hurt to get a third opinion. And to always keep this in mind when Annabelle comes in for her checkups. That was the plan, then. Dr. Burks would send Annabelle's x-rays to the University of Illinois to get a third opinion. She'd also post it to a site where a radiologist could give his opinion. Back in the examiningroom with a still very heavily sedated Annabelle, Dr. Burks was talking to me about arthritis in older dogs .. . "Urn, Dr. Burks?" I interrupt. "Belly is not an older dog. She's still just a pup pup." Temple Grandin, speaking from her own experiences with autism, writes, "One of the things that blows my mind about normal human beings is denial" (92). Dr. Burks told me, too, that she was amazed by Annabelle's ease of movement, especially in that left elbow. Most dogs with that level of disease (please don't call my baby girl diseased) can barely walk and</page><page sequence="9">Amy Robillard 793 when they do they walk with an exaggerated bowleg. "But you and Steve are so good with these dogs. All that exercise absolutely helps." Beaming. WWW What did I feel just then when Dr. Burks shared her concern with me? Was I just a little bit relieved to know that this was how it was going to end? Maybe. For a split second. I was consciously split into subject and object, observing myself taking in the news of this possibility. How had I always imagined myself hearing bad news about Bel ly? How do I behave now that it seems I can stop trying to predict the worst? How can I possibly be relieved at the prospect of Belly' s having cancer? Judging myself for a split second of feeling. Disavowing it because it is improper, evidence that I don't really love her as much as I think I do. I wrote this account of those days in February with Annabelle and stopped where I did because, though the whole point of writing the story was to try to understand my inability to articulate my feelings of helpless ness when Annabelle is sick, I knew?and I still know?that I don't know how to write about the agony I experienced between Thursday and Monday when we heard from the radiologist. It has literally been months since I wrote this account and ended with my pride in taking such good care of Annabelle. WWW Annabelle is a beautiful dog. Her shiny coat is speckled with stray white hairs that mark her age, but the white on her chest and on her feet was there from the beginning. She's got white hairs on her long snout: the ones on top, original to her markings; the ones on her lower jaw, signs of age. A friend once remarked that it looked like Belly' d stuck her foot in a white paint can and then brushed it bashfully against her snout. She's wise, what you might call an old soul. She's always been an old soul, even when she was a puppy. By contrast, Wrigley will never be an old soul, even when she's fourteen. She's carefree and silly, an eternal puppy. Annabelle is regal, dignified, thoughtful.</page><page sequence="10">794 jac * * * Steve and I were coming home from grocery shopping when Dr. Burks called with another vet's opinion of the x-ray. It was a Thursday evening. I was pulling into the garage when the phone rang. I took the call while Steve brought the groceries inside and greeted the dogs. Dr. Burks told me that the vet at the U of I was also concerned about that spot on the x-ray. And my memory has Dr. Burks telling me that if this is cancer, it's bone cancer, one of the most painful kind. Because of where it is, tangled in that mass of arthritis, it would be all but untreatable. All they could do for my girl was try to ease the pain and even the most powerful meds really can't touch this kind of pain. Translation: She's dying of bone cancer and there's nothing you can do to make her feel better. I thanked Dr. Burks, who assured me that she would call me again on Monday when she heard from the radiologist?his would be an important opinion. I walked up the stairs and as soon as Steve looked at me, I started wailing. Wailing. Agony. Tears. Shaking. Blubbering. And then Steve told me to stop and look at Belly. She was shaking, tail between her legs, ears plastered back on her head, scared to death of my outburst. The being I loved most in the world was scared by my fear. I took a deep breath, pul led myself together, and comforted my girl. I've been anticipating Annabelle's death since the day I adopted her. I imagine the day I have to make the decision to put her down, and my eyes well up, my stomach turns. I make myself sick over it. For a long time, I named these experiences "anticipatory grief," grateful that there was even a concept that captured the complicated feelings I had for my girl. Anticipatory grief is most often written about with respect to humans dying of terminal illness, but anticipatory grief for animals, too, is the subject of thanatologists' work on death and dying. Anticipatory grief, mourning for a loss that has not yet occurred, is described as a grief that "often begins at the time of diagnosis of a terminal illness_The reality that their pet has a finite time to live gives rise to this early grief response, though the pet may have months or even years to live and may not yet be showing any outward signsof illness" (Toray). Annabelledid not have aterminal illness when I adopted her at age ten months; she did, of course, have a finite time to live, as we all do. My preoccupation with time and my nagging inability</page><page sequence="11">Amy Robillard 795 to predict how I will remember this moment I'm living right now? moments in class, moments with friends, moments of what seems like incredible insight?lead me to want to theorize the rhetorical functions of what I would now call anticipatory nostalgia. I wasn't?I'm not? grieving. Instead, I'm desperately tryingto control and shape the nostalgia I know I will feel one day when she's gone. WWW During that weekend in February, I spent a lot of time on the computer researching canine osteosarcoma. I read personal accounts by owners whose beloved dogs had suffered from the disease for months and by owners who decided early on to euthanize their dogs. Most canine osteosarcoma is found in the limbs, and veterinarians who believe they have caught the cancer early may recommend amputating the limb to stop the spread of the disease. I read accounts of dogs who'd had one leg amputated only to succumb four or five months later to the disease. I read owners' attempts to describe the pain their dogs experienced, and I imagined myself trying to tell others about Annabelle's pain. I would tell them it was like nothing I'd ever seen before. I would tell them it wasn't anything I'd wish on my worst enemy. I'd say I just wanted it to end. In these ways, I tried to prepare myself to articulate something that could not be articulated. Imadeend-of-life decisions in my head, tellingmyselfthat I was doing what was best for her. I made deals with the god I don't believe in. I showered Annabelle with love that weekend. I made her muffins on Sunday morning, gave her extra treats, told her again and again how much I love her, how I would do anything for her, how I can't live without her. Because I've heard it said that dogs can smell cancer, I more than once pulled Wrigley over to Annabelle's elbow, stuck her nose right near it and said, "What do you smell, girl? Tell me Belly doesn't have cancer." Wrigley would give me a quizzical look and stick her nose instead in Annabelle's behind. Steve remained optimistic, and I tried to follow suit by rationalizing that, if pain meds couldn't come anywhere near the pain of bone cancer and Annabelle seemed to be pain-free, then logically it couldn't be cancer. Right? Because the pain meds seemed to be working. And if it were cancer, they wouldn't be.</page><page sequence="12">796 jac In this way, I somehow made it through the weekend. Dr. Burks called Monday evening to tel I us that the radiologist believed that the speckled mass was actually a result of the arthritis, not cancer. I breathed. So we'll still do another set of x-rays in a week, but right now it looks like she's okay. W * W "Societal belief," Kuzniar notes, "holds that candid expressive grief over a mere dog is improper" (139). Of the cultural narratives that circu late and attach themselves to notions of dog love, perhaps the most pervasive is that grief for animals is a form of what sociologist Kenneth Doka calls disenfranchised grief. It only makes sense, of course, that if we are limited in our ability to apprehend and name our affective relations with dogs, we will find ourselves at a similar loss when faced with grieving the death of a beloved animal. The concept of disenfranchised grief emphasizes the social aspect of grief, which Doka points out is often neglected in literature on grief and loss (6). "Although the individual grieves, others do not acknowledge that the individual has a right to grieve. The person is not offered the 'rights' or 'grieving role' that would lay claim to social sympathy and support or given such compensations as time off from work or diminishment of social responsibilities" (6). Doka suggests that there are three categories of loss that are not recognized by social norms and are thus disenfranchised: losses in which the relationship is not recognized might include, for example, the loss of an adu lterous or a homosexual lover or the loss of an ex-spouse; losses that are not acknowledged or considered significant might include abortion, foster chi ldren, or pets; and situations in which the griever herself is excluded, understood as not capable of grief, might apply to, for example, the very old or the very young and persons with developmental disabilities (13). Disenfranchisement is itself a loss, one that intensifies one's already difficult emotional reactions to grief (17) and by definition "precludes social support" (18). Social support of grieving is a matter of acknowledgment and recognition of the right to embody the role of griever. Jeffrey Kauffman characterizes the concept of disenfranchised grief as a liberating one: "It fosters recognition that loss not allowed into the</page><page sequence="13">Amy Robillard 797 socially sanctioned psychological grief space is, nonetheless, actually there. Recognizing a loss to be a loss gives the loss legitimacy, al lows it to come into being. The act of recognition gives approval or permission, allowing the loss to be realized" (65). In the case of dog loss, then, the very naming of such grief as disenfranchised calls attention to it as loss and functions to enfranchise grievers. Grief for a beloved animal family member is understood to be simultaneously deep and unrecognized. But because we all know that it is unrecognized, we go out of our way to recognize it in others or voice it for ourselves. We become enfranchised by laying claim to our marginalized role as those who grieve for a relationship so many can never understand. In this way, we work to ward off the shame that so often accompanies disenfranchisement. Disenfran chisement affects not only our ability to grieve but also our conceptions of ourselves as persons able to regulate our own experience. Kauffman explains that "being disenfranchised is itself a loss, a loss that is a narcissistic injury to one's self-regard and to how one experiences, values, secures, and defines oneself (63). Disenfranchised grief by definition splits us into subject and object; we observe ourselves grieving, wondering to what extent our grief is socially sanctioned in different cultural contexts. "One of the unspoken truths of American life," Doty writes, "is how deeply people grieve over the animals who live and die with them, how real that emptiness is, how profound the silence is these creatures leave in their wake. Our culture expects us not only to bear these losses alone, but to be ashamed of how deeply we feel them" (9). By virtue of living and participating in a culture that does not acknowledge grief for animals, we judge our own emotions about our dogs, thereby contributing to the very disenfranchisement that we may wish to challenge. WWW Steve and I took the girls swimming yesterday at a smal 1 pond in town. The ride there takes about fifteen excruciating minutes. Each dog has her head out a car window, barking barking barking with excitement as I drive. When we come to a red light or a stop sign, they stop as if to acknowledge that the car is no longer moving. As soon as I hit the gas pedal, though, they're barking again. Sometimes they do it in sync; sometimes they</page><page sequence="14">798 jac alternate. Always Steve and I cringe. And always I say to him, "Someday we'll miss this." Belly swims like a hippo?slow and steady, head bobbing along; Wrigley like a dog with undiagnosed ADHD?bounding and splashing and ingesting so much water that she inevitably pukes. Disenfranchised grief of any kind silences us. With disenfranchised grief for a dog, that silencing functions as an additional insult, for the stories we tell about our dogs bring them into being. While Doty notes that "most stories about dogs are narrated to other people, as we go on articulating the tales of our animals' lives, in order to bring their otherwise incompre hensible experience into the more orderly world of speech" (1-2), I think it's crucial to recognize that the stories we tell to our dogs, the ways we talk to them everyday, bring them into being for us in ways that others can never know. The grief we experience when we lose a beloved dog is disenfranchised not because, as Doka would have it, the animal itself is not considered a significant loss but because the relationship we have with that particular animal is not recognized as significant. This may seem like a minor distinction. But as Barbara Meyers explains, dogs are valued when they are understood to be fulfilling some utilitarian purpose such as assisting blind or deaf persons (251). Otherwise, dogs who are simply pets are not understood to be useful and so their loss is not recognized as significant enough to be acknowledged. This discourse of utility renders useless the phatic functions of the language I use to talk to Annabelle everyday. Talking to her rights me when I'm confused or frustrated. The language that passes from me to my dog regulates me in ways that ensure that losingherwill constitute a loss, too, of my ability to self-regulate. When Steve and I are away from home and I need grounding, I'll say, apropos of nothing, "Booda" or "Bug Bug," two of the many nicknames I have for Annabelle. What will I say when she's gone? Love, like so many complex emotions, Doty reminds us, is resistant to language. "Being in love is our most common version of the unsayable;</page><page sequence="15">Amy Robillard 799 everyone seems to recognize that you can't experience it from the outside, not quite?you have to feel it from the inside to know what it is" (2). He suggests, too, that perhaps "the experience of loving an animal is actually more resistant to language, since animals cannot speak back to us, cannot characterize themselves or correct our assumptions about them" (2-3). I think he's partially correct. I would add that the experience of loving an animal is even more resistant to language than other experiences of love at least in part because we are surrounded by, constituted by, and participants in a discourse about dogs that renders them useful or useless objects, at worst, and objects of affection, at best. WWW Me, talking to Annabelle: My god, you are so beautiful. Steve: Thank you. Men generally prefer to be called handsome. Me: I love you love you love you so so so so much. Do you know how much I love you? Do you? Oh how Mama loves that girl. Steve: I love you, too. WWW The complexity of our emotional experiences with dogs is further obfus cated by discourses of sentimentality. The sentimental is by definition non critical. The sentimental idealizes, generalizes, and protects us from the confusion of particularity. The sentimental invites easy critique; an argument against the sentimental need not proceed any further than simple refusal. Doty suggests that sentimentality works by replacing particularity with a warm fog of acceptable feeling, the difficult exact stuff of individual character with the vagueness of convention. Sentimental assertions are always a form of detach ment; they confront the acute, terrible awareness of individual pain, the sharp particularity of loss or the fierce individuality of passion with the dully "universal" certainty of platitude. (13) The sentimental is easily dismissed, yet the temptation to surrender to the sentimental when describing emotional attachments to animals is almost</page><page sequence="16">800 jac irresistible. I've been arguing that part of the reason for this is a more general inability to articulate complexity of emotion, whether for animals or for humans. It's much easier for me to tell a sentimental story about the fact that Annabelle has had the same stuffed toy named Baby since she was a year old. This allows me to take pride in Annabelle's ability to take care of her things; she's not like most dogs who destroy stuffed toys within hours to get to the squeaker inside. Annabelle is far more civilized, which makes me a good dog person. Easier to tell this than to try to describe the feeling in my stomach when I see her hurt. A kind of trembling nausea. A place I don't want to go. But I'm persuaded, too, by Doty's claim that part of the irresistibility of the sentimental in reference to dogs arises from a desire to mask anger. Anger, he writes, "at the beautiful image refusing to hold, at the tenderness we bring to the objects of the world?our eagerness to love, make home, build connection, trust the other?how all of that's so readily swept away. Sentimental images of children and of animals, sappy representations of love?they are fueled, in truth, by their opposites, by aterrible human rage that nothing stays" (15). Sentimentality protects us from this rage, quiets the desire to seek justice for the unstoppable passage of time. Our commonplace expressions about the grief of animals sentimen tally refuse the particularity of the animal we've loved. She's in a better place now. She's no longer in pain. She lived a good life. There is no necessary connection between these hollow deictic phrases and the dog whose jowls flap in the wind as she rides along in the back seat of the car, the dog who paws at the coffee table each morning as she engages in a stare-down with Steve for her morning turkey bacon. This is not to say that each of these commonplaces will not be true of Annabelle when she passes. Instead, to say that there is no necessary connection between these expressions and my singular Annabelle is to attempt to control my future remembrances. Sentimentality risks the erasure of my memories, the dulling of the specificity of my relationship with this singular dog. But it also protects me from a future filled with anger that "nothing stays." I write about Annabelle now because I want to prevent myself from havingto struggle to remember the particularities of our relationship later, after she's gone. I don't want to have only language to recreate her. Kuzniar notes that the exigency for so many autobiographical works by</page><page sequence="17">Amy Robillard 801 dog owners is the death of the dog and that so many seem to follow a similar pattern: "Although they conventionally begin with the puppy arriving in the new home, the close invariably betrays that the writing originates in mourning" (141). The psychic functions of such writing, Kuzniar explains, is to "enact its coming back to life," "to anticipate the trauma of loss and thereby mitigate against the full impact of its shock" (143). For this to work, one must believe in the power of language to resurrect. "The writer tries to regain the intensity of their relation through language. If language is always haunted by its own uncertainties and imprecision, especially with regards to a species who does not share it, at least in bringing a dead pet back to life through signs, language can seem to triumph" (143). But with so many ideological forces working against us as we try to articulate the specificities of a human-canine relationship in the present, how much harder will it be to recover that relationship through language? Won't the seductive powers of sentimentality win? When I was a kid, my mother refused to take any of my i llnesses seriously. I always thought that it is because of this that I get so upset about Annabelle's inability to tell me where it hurts or how much, that this is the reason I seem to overreact when something's wrong with my girl. But I'm beginning to understand that my mother, too, was protecting herself against the trauma of loss. And I seem to be courting it by anticipating Annabelle's death. WWW My mother's first daughter, Pam, was seventeen years old by the time I was born. She did not share my father, though he adopted her when he married my mother. When Pam was fifteen, she became pregnant with her first baby. She gave birth to a little girl. She married the father, and I'm to Id that my mother was pivotal in that decision. My other sister, Sue, tells me that our mother forced them to marry. Pam was pregnant again, this time at the same time that my mother was pregnant with me. Two weeks after Pam gave birth to Kelly, she was in the hospital with failing kidneys.</page><page sequence="18">802 jac She was diagnosed with pancreatitis. If this had happened to her while she'd been pregnant, they both would've died. I've always known that Pam died when she was twenty-two. Kidney failure brought on by pancreatitis, I told anyone who asked. I memorized this fact but I never really knew what it meant. I never really knew what my mother went through watching her daughter die slowly and painfully. She suffered for five years. About two years in, the doctors gathered with my mother and Pam's husband, Don, to get a sense of how they felt about pulling the plug. These are the words my mother used. Me: Pulling the plug? Wouldn't that imply that she was plugged into a respirator? My mother: It's just a saying. My mother was in favor of pulling the plug, but Don was not. "So he decided to let her suffer for a few more years," my mother tells me. "I wouldn't let a dog suffer the way she suffered. It was disgusting." Don was the husband. It was his decision to make. Where were the babies during all this, I ask. With Don's mother. Did Pam ever get to see them? Sure, Don would bring them in when he could. She didn't get to leave the hospital very often because of the dialysis, but on the days that she could, he'd run through the hospital pushing that wheelchair so fast he nearly knocked over other patients. He was so happy to get her out of there. WWW Nostalgia is a bad word not simply because it describes an emotion that is helplessly and hopelessly sentimental but because it suggests a detach ment from reality, a refusal to acknowledge that the past has passed. In a culture that prizes progress and infantilizes regression, nostalgia is an indulgence suitable only for those with no imagination and no future. Nostalgia's negative affective content likely stems from the word's origins in medicine. In "Nostalgia and its Discontents," Svetlana Boym explains that "contrary to our intuition, 'nostalgia' came from medicine, not from poetry or politics. It would not occur to us to demand a prescription for nostalgia. Yet in the seventeenth century, nostalgia was considered to be</page><page sequence="19">Amy Robillard 803 a curable disease, akin to a severe common cold" (7). Nostalgia, from the Greek nostos (the return home) and algia (longing), is literally a longing for a return home, but Boym suggests that it is better understood as a "yearning for a different time?the time of our childhood, the slower rhythm of our dreams" (8). Our desire to deny nostalgia, to dismiss it as a simplified, indulgent desire for a time long gone, belies its ubiquity not despite but as a result of technological progress. Boym explains that "while many nineteenth-century thinkers believed progress and enlightenment would cure nostalgia, they have exacerbated it instead. Technology that once promised to bridge modern displacement and distance and provide the miracle prosthesis for nostalgic aches has itself become much faster than nostalgic longing" (10). Boym claims for nostalgia and technology a co-dependent relationship: "new technology and advanced marketing stimulate . . . anticipatory nostalgia?for the present that flees with the speed of a click" (10). The faster we move, the more nostalgic we become. The faster our connection to technology, the greater our desire to stop time. And, extending Doty's claim about sentimentality to nostalgia, I want to suggest that the faster our connection to technology and the greater our desire to stop time, the greater our desire to suppress and thereby protect ourselves from the anger that prompts nostalgia. Nostalgia arises from an anger that what we once had cannot be had again. If love is resistant to language, and I agree with Doty that it largely is, anger is for different reasons ideologically resistant to articulation in a culture whose primary aim is to legislate our affective relations to power. Anger that we cannot stop time, that we cannot have again what we once had is taboo in a culture that values progress, newness, and moving forward. Indeed, moving on is one of our most beloved ways of expressing and prescribing healthy emotional response. Our facility with language is what we're taught separates us from animals; we value humans over animals because "relationships (which require self-con sciousness and understanding of others) depend on verbal facility and the use of language" (Arluke and Sanders 2). But isn't what we love about dogs is their inability to use language to judge us, to place conditions on us, to qualify their feelings for us?1 Doty's explanation of the relationship between sentimentality and anger calls into question our professed preference for relationships with other language-using beings:</page><page sequence="20">804 jac If I persist in my assertion that sentimentality is a mask for anger, it isn't hard to point toward the particular source behind this brand of sentimentality: that another human being will never bring to us the same unqualified, unconditional regard that a dog does. Our full immersion in language brings with it qualification and condition; once we enter the world of signs, we can never again be so single minded. (34). Similarly, Alexandra Horowitz notes that part of what she treasures about dogs "is the very fact that they do not use language." She takes pains to note, "Not muteness: absence of linguistic noise" (119). Sentimentality masks the anger that arises from the problems inherent in the language of emotion; at the same time that we are immersed in language with a limited vocabulary to express complex emotion, we use that very language to qualify, to judge, and to protect ourselves from the emotions we cannot articulate. WWW In, "George," an essay that begins with the death of his beloved dog, Sam Pickering narrates his attempts, successful and not, to avoid the over whelming emotion that George represents for him. Pickering represents himself as alternately cruelly callous and devastated by his beloved dog's impending death. "Suddenly I became angry at myself," Pickering writes. "Grieving for an animal was unseemly. George was a dog, not a human. I breathed deeply and checked my emotion. When a person cared more for a pet than for people, something was out of joint" (138). Detailing the precise costs associated with George's care is another of Pickering's thinly veiled attempts to persuade himself that life will be better once George is gone. Tellingjokes, a quintessential^ American defense against grief, provides another distraction from the sorrow that consumes him as he watches his beloved companion deteriorate. In these ways, the narrator's internal struggle becomes externalized by way of practiced defense mechanisms; indeed, the narrator's awareness of his use of practiced defense mechanisms and his employment of them even in the writing of the essay, implicates readers in ways that allow us to see in ourselves, perhaps, what we'd been up to this point refusing to see. Our</page><page sequence="21">Amy Robillard 805 facility with language allows us to manipulate our perceptions of real ity to the point that we no longer have to admit to feeling. WWW It is nostalgia's sentimentality, its seeming simplicity that prevents us from understanding that it arises from anger, itself an outlaw emotion. Like sentimentality, nostalgia is uncritical, imprecise, and sappy. To suggest, as Boym does, a dependent relationship between technology and nostalgia is to reconsider technology's status as an unquestionable good. Anticipatory nostalgia feeds on the technologies of writing, photography, and video. Drawing on my experiences of anticipatory nostalgia with this dog I love, I want to suggest that anticipatory nostalgia is a problem of rhetoric, of representation. I turn to anticipatory nostalgia?I manipulate future memories by taking photographs and writing sentimental stories?be cause I cannot "adequately name and understand the social and political dimension" of my affective life (Worsham, "Coming" 110). The shame I am then persuaded to feel for indulging in anticipatory nostalgia is compounded by my awareness of the cultural narratives into which my relationship with Annabelle could so easily be inserted. Narratives of dog love, then, persuade us to feel shame rather than express the anger we feel as a result of being disenfranchised. We have no problem ridiculing dog lovers for their love, charging that dog lovers turn to dogs because they can't have children or human lovers or they simply can't sustain significant relationships with other people. When a beloved dog dies, then, the dog lover's grief is disenfranchised in part as a logical extension of these narratives and in part as a result of our inadequate vocabulary for complex emotions. Recall, though, that in the very act of being disenfranchised, grief for a dog is itself recognized as loss and, as such, becomes enfranchised when grievers lay claim to their experience. But laying claim to their experience is made difficult by an inadequate vocabulary. So we find ourselves saying things like, "She was my best friend" or "She's in a better place now, no longer in pain." We comfort ourselves by saying, as Steve and I did about his dog Mulder, "She's in the big buffet in the sky." Nostalgia simplifies, erasing individuality and generalizing loss.</page><page sequence="22">806 jac Anticipatory nostalgia, however, functions differently because its primary aim is to control future memory. Preoccupied with the future, anticipatory nostalgia forces us to notice the particularity and the contin gency of this moment. Whereas anticipatory grief is a defensive attempt to prepare oneself for the inevitable, anticipatory nostalgia is a feeling of dis-ease in the moment, a desire to stop time and continue to feel what one feels right now. Anticipatory nostalgia is a recognition, too, that moments do not last, and as such it shapes the decisions we make in the present. How will I remember this moment? How might I shape this moment to maximum memorial effect? Anticipatory nostalgia seeks to atone for the wrong done to us by time. And yet. I wouldn't be experiencing anticipatory nostalgia if I weren't trying to protect myself from the inevitable. Though I say, and it's true, that I've been anticipating Annabelle's death since the day I adopted her, my desire to write about her originated in an attempt to understand the feelings I experienced during that awful weekend in February when I had to come to terms with the distinct possibility that Annabelle had an incurable form of cancer. Kuzniar's psychoanalytic examination of Marie Bonaparte's Topsy provides some insight here. Bonaparte's chow, Topsy, develops a cancerous tumor but is soon cured. Yet Bonaparte "continues to be haunted by worries that the cancer might return," and Kuzniar notes that the fact of Topsy's cure makes us wonder "what motivates these recurrent fantasies" (146). Kuzniar proposes plausible psychoanalytic explanations of Bonaparte's fantasy, but it is not until she turns to psychoanalytic theories of trauma that I begin to understand my own anticipation of Annabelle's death differently. Kuzniar explains: It is only subsequently that the survivor erects the defenses that should have been present in the first place to protect the self. This fortification after the fact... occurs via an unconscious repetition compulsion: the victim imagines reconfronting the stimulus, which is retrospectively mastered by developing the anxiety that was previously omitted. Involuntary disturbing fantasies surface with the psychic purpose of preventing or postponing future trauma _Trauma theory thusclarifiesBonaparte'sotherwise inexplicable fantasies concerning Topsy's death even after the dog is cured: she returns to the thought of the pet dying because the initial shock came so unexpectedly, never allowing her to master its acceptance. (150)</page><page sequence="23">Amy Robillard 807 The shock of a potential cancer diagnosis came so suddenly, and my reaction was so unplanned, so unrehearsed, that since that time, my anticipatory grief has morphed into a kind of anticipatory mourning. I'm trying so desperately to prepare myself for the inevitable, to protect myself from melancholia that I theorize my relationship with Annabelle as one of anticipatory nostalgia so that I can remember the specificity of this dog. At the same time that I seem to be courting death, I'm also experiencing a desire to stop time, to tell it to stay, to comfort my future self with the knowledge that the time we had together was worthwhile. WWW I love when she gives Wrigley the five-point inspection. Wrigley stands perfectly still while Annabelle circles her, sniffingand snooting, getting the story of where Wrigley's been and what she's done out there in the yard. It's hard for me to imagine that the story changes much from day to day, but what do I know? Wrigley always smells the same to me. WWW My mother was not prepared for the loss of her firstborn daughter. Her reactions to my illnesses when I was growing up could be understood as her way of developing the affective responses she was unable to have with Pam. If she didn't react, she didn't need to feel so much pain watching her other daughter suffer. If she doesn't let herself believe that it's severe or that it warrants medical attention, perhaps her other daughter won't die. Or perhaps she' 11 gain back some of the control she never had with Pam' s illness. Dismissal, after all, is a kind of control. Again, the vanity. How can I presume to understand my mother's reactions to a trauma I can never comprehend, a trauma that was for me for so long just a couple of facts to recite when strangers asked about my siblings? I can't. But I can use this attempt to understand as a starting point for revising narratives of my childhood. And perhaps I can use such revised narratives of my childhood to go easier on myself about my reactions to Annabelle's pain.</page><page sequence="24">808 jac WWW I've already begun looking at her differently. I hesitate before putting words into her mouth. I let her linger over sniffs on walks more. I try not to pull her away because I understand better now that her sniffing is my seeing. She's trying to take things in, and I'm too often trying to get the walk over with. The older she gets, the less those walks are going to be about exercise, the more they're going to be about giving her the opportunity to sniff, to see what's happening and what's been happening in her neighborhood. WWW The speckled spot on Annabelle's elbow turned out to be a manifestation of her severe arthritis. We treat it on an as-needed basis, which is usually after a run or a swim. We take her swimming as much as we can, as this is the best exercise for her arthritic legs. She also has a disease that causes her body to reject her toenails as they're growing back in, so she needs regular nail trims. These cause her pain, especially on one of her front feet, and it seems to be easier on her if I'm not in the room with her when Dr. Burks cuts her nails. I become nearly paralyzed with grief when I see my girl hurting. I worry that I' m being j udged for caring too much; my pain over Annabel le' s suffering makes me an excellent candidate for the role of pathetic dog lover. When I lived through that weekend with the distinct possibility that my girl might have cancer, I also recognized on some level, if not aloud, that the very word cancer legitimized my fears and my overprotective ways with Annabelle. I called every friend I had who knew Annabelle, told them the story, and could feel a desire welling up in me each time, a desire that my friends would tell me that it's good that I'm so attuned to Annabelle's health. Arthritis, an unpronounceable toenail disease?these don't war rant panic. Cancer, however, is another story. WWW</page><page sequence="25">Amy Robillard 809 I compare my mother's reactions to my illnesses as a child to my adult reactions to Annabelle's illnesses. I seem to have come to an understand ing that I need to rethink the narratives I cling to, those that depict my mother as neglectful and those that depict me as overprotective. And as I reread this very essay, I realize that I don't have to look very far to begin that rethinking. My mother stopped telling me we were going to Mountain Park the next day because she wanted to prevent the nausea that so often accompanies excitement for me. She both protected me and neglected me. Impossible to say that either one is the truth. What is possible is an acknowledgment that my subscription to the cultural narrative that characterizes my concern for Annabelle as excessive is dependent upon my subscription to my personal narrative that depicts me as an innocent victim and my mother as uncomplicatedly neglectful. Both rely upon the commonplace pop-psychological belief that the child rebels against the mother by consciously behaving in ways unlike the mother. Both rely, too, on the equation of Annabelle with a child. All three belie the complexities of both human and animal behavior. WWW When I worry aloud that I won't be able to sleep when she's gone for fear of losing her again in my dreams, my friend Julie tells me that her beloved cat, Girl, now comes to her in her dreams. WWW Nostalgia is uncritical; it is sentimental, it is sappy. We turn to it because we do not have an adequate vocabulary for articulating complex emotions. We stick with it because it allows us to deflect the pain of the anger that prompts it. Nostalgia traffics in cliches and sentimentality; swathed in nostalgia, we do not have to critically analyze the cultural and personal narratives we cling to as protection against the pain of loss. "Nostalgia," Boym writes, "is not always about the past; it can be retrospective but also prospective. Fantasies of the past determined by needs of the present have a direct impact on the realities of the future. Consideration of the future makes us take responsibility for our nostalgic tales" (Future xvi). Antici</page><page sequence="26">810 jac patory nostalgia's focus on the now, this moment, shapes future memory in ways that can only be more responsible, ways that make it just a bit more difficult to uncritically accept narratives of what we were like then or what we would do. In anticipation, we write and we tell stories and we take photos to secure the particularity of this day, this love, this dog. Illinois State University Normal, Illinois Notes 1. This is not to say that dogs do not communicate affection, as any number of scholars are eager to point out. Horowitz, for instance, takes great care to distinguish among the sounds dogs make, including whimpers, growls, squeaks, and chuckles (100). She notes, too, that "there is a language of the body, formed of phonemes made from rumps, heads, ears, legs, and tails" (109). Works Cited Arluke, Arnold, and Clinton R. Sanders. Regarding Animals.
