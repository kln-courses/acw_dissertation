<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancient Cultures of Siberia and the Pacific Basin [This conference report, programmatic in nature, is printed as an exception to general CA policy, which is to concentrate on the substantive contributions of the conference to the state of anthro- pology. No such overall report can be produced at this late stage, however, and it was my view that a listing of contributions would serve a useful purpose in its absence.-EDITOR.] by ROBERT E. ACKERMAN Department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Pullman, Wash. 99163, U.S.A. 7 VII 76 An all-Union symposium to which foreign participants were invited was held in Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk, U.S.S.R., October 20-22, 1975, to consider the latest research discoveries in Siberia, the Soviet Far East, Japan, and North America relating to the origin of cultures in these realms and their inter- relations. The symposium was sponsored by the Institute of History, Philology, and Philosophy, Siberian Department, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. and organized by A. P. Okladnikov, A. P. Derevianko, L. Afanaseva, Yu. M. Butin, R. S. Vasilevski, A. I. Krushanov, V. E. Larichev, and E. V. Shavkunov. It was organized around three problems, each of which constituted the theme for one day. Participants spent the day after the conference at the Institute, where they had the opportunity to study research collections and view exhibits and films made by members. For the North American partici- pants, the conference provided an opportunity to meet and interact with Soviet archeologists, geologists, historians, eth- nographers, and physical anthropologists. Mutual research interests were explored and plans for joint research considered. We are particularly indebted to A. P. Okladnikov and express our thanks to the numerous other helpful scientists and research workers who gave generously of their time to make our stay a pleasant one. The papers of the conference were presented in Russian or English with concurrent translations. Because of many last- minute changes, the original program was altered considerably during the course of the session. Several participants were un- able to make the meeting, and others graciously gave up their scheduled times to permit the presentation of papers not pre- viously listed. In the list that follows, substitutions have been noted, and affiliations of the participants are given where provided or known to me. The papers marked with an asterisk have been published in a volume entitled Correlation of the Ancient Cultures of Siberia with the Cultures of Adjoining Terri- tories (Novosibirsk: Institute of History, Philology, and Philos- ophy, 1975). The other papers presented will be collected in a separate publication. Chronology of the Stone Age in Siberia and the correlation of the ancient cultures of this region (Chairmen: A. P.
