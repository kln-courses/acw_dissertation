<plain_text><page sequence="1">DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN? Sommaire Des savants, en se basant sur 1QSIX: 4-5 et un midrash rabbinique sur Osée Osée 14: 3, ont déclaré que à Qumran la prière avait remplacée les sacri fices. Cette étude conteste cette opinion, parce que le premier sacrifice obli gatoire de la journée était effectué au lever du soleil, et le deuxième avant le coucher du soleil, tandis qu'à Qumran la première prière était récitée après le coucher du soleil, au passage de la lumière aux ténèbres, et le deuxième à l'aube, au passage des ténèbres à la lumière. Summary Scholars have stated, on the basis of 1QSIX: 4-5 and a rabbinic homily on Hosea 14:3, that in Qumran, just as in rabbinic society, prayer replaced the sacrifices. This study contests this opinion, since the first obligatory daily Tamid was performed at sunrise, and the second before sunset, whereas Qumran's first daily prayer was recited after sunset, at the passage from light to darkness, and the second in the early morning, at the passage from darkness to light. Introduction A number of scholars have argued, explicitly or implicitly, (1) that prayer replaced sacrifices at Qumran. B. Nitzan, for instance, (2) (1) See, e.g., S.Talmon,"The Manual of Benedictions," RevQ 2/8 (1959/60) 475-500, who suggests that prayers "developed to fill the void created in the life of the community and the individual alike, by the cessation of sacrifice" (p. 476); R. A. Kugler, "Rewriting Rubrics: Sacrifice and the Religion of Qumran," in Religion Religion in the Dead Sea Scrolls, pp. 90-112, eds. J. J. Collins and R. A. Kugler, (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2000), who states: "Some say that the community's prayer and praise, or alternatively its life of Scripture reading and Interpretation, replaced sacrifice, while others suggest that the group constituted itself as a temple community, thus eliminating the need for ablations" (pp. 90-91). (2) B. Nitzan, "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish Liturgy,5' in The Dead Sea Sea Scrolls as Background to Postbiblical Judaism and Early Christianity, pp. 195-219, ed. J. Davila (Leiden: Brill, 2003).</page><page sequence="2">PAUL HEGER 214 writes that the term □חרומח שפחי "the offering of the lips" in 1QS IX: 4-5 and 1QS X: 6 refers to prayer, and that prayer replaced the sacrifices. L. H. Schiffman bundles together a number of factors that he claims replaced sacrifices, stating: "Prayer, purity, study, and sectarian life itself served as a replacement for the Temple." (3) He does not explicitly specify here which deeds replaced the concrete sacrifices, but from the context one must understand him to say in general that sacrifices were not performed at Qumran, and that one or more of the above activities replaced them. He also does not specify the textual sources on which he bases his statement, but one may assume that the above two Qumran citations were among them. In another article he does write explicitly: "Liturgical texts from the Qumran corpus testify to morning and late afternoon prayers, on the analogy of the daily sacrifices in the Temple... we can see prayer already replacing Temple worship even before the destruction of the Temple in 70 C. E." (4) It is evident that Schiff man refers to the obligatory daily and festival Tamid offerings. E. G. Chazon, in her study of Qumran prayers and songs and their relationship to the Temple cult, makes the indefinite statement: "It is common knowledge that prayer functioned at Qumran as a substitute for the Temple cult from which the sect seceded." (5) She does not state explicitly that prayer replaced the obligatory daily sacrifices; she conjectures that the songs created a virtual expe rience of being present in the heavenly Temple. I disagree that prayer replaced the daily obligatory Tamid (6) sacrifices in the Qumran community, and will support my opinion in several ways. I suspect that the above scholars, as well as others of (3) L. H. Schiffman, "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Early History of Jewish Liturgy, in" The Synagogue in Late Antiquity, pp. 33-48, ed. Lee I.

Davila (Leiden 2003), at 17-18. He repeats on pp. 18 19: "The fragments of daily liturgical texts, however, testify to a system of two daily prayers, held in the morning and late afternoon, at the time of the morning and late afternoon daily sacrifices" He associates this issue with the rabbinic dispute concerning whether the evening prayer is obligatory, an issue I will discuss below.

(6) In my book to be published in the near future, I have discussed at length the issue of what the "separation from the Temple" really meant in prac tice — that is, the specific sacrifices that were not offered and the relevant hala khic implications.</page><page sequence="3">DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? 215 the same opinion, have been influenced by the apparently parallel rabbinic dictum that prayer, among other deeds, replaces the sacri fices in the absence of the Temple. In particular, the use of the term שפתים in the rabbinic homilies that reinterpret Hosea 14:3: "So will we render the calves of our lips" (KJV translation of 14:2), (7) likely led to this presumption. (8) It seems to me, however, that before one uses rabbinic parallels there must be diligent scrutiny of the simila rities and dissimilarities, and of the consequences that may differ in each case. (9) I will demonstrate that the connections made in rabbinic literature between prayer and sacrifice are not present in the various Qumran writings dealing with prayer, nor are they supported by Qumran ,s particular theology. Finally, I will show that the term שפתים in 1QS IX: 4-5 and 1QS X: 6 does not necessarily refer to prayer. Rabbinic Theory Regarding Replacement of Sacrifice There are three different motives and rationalizations in rabbinic literature for the institution of prayer. In one such rationa lization the two daily offerings of the obligatory Tamid are replaced by the שחרית "morning" and מנחה "Minhah" prayers. But this ratio nalization is not appropriate to the Qumran circumstances, as we shall see below. In bBerakhot 26b, (10) in a dispute between two sages, one states: "The Patriarchs instituted the obligation for prayer" Citing a baraita, the passage then gives details regarding which of the three daily prayers was instituted by each Patriarch, and the biblical support for each: Abraham established the morning prayer, as it is said [written], "and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood (7) The KJV seems to follow the literal translation of the LXX. A. R. C. Leaney, Manual of Discipline. The Rule of Qumran and its Meaning (Philadel phia, 1966) bases his interpretation of the Qumran text on Heb 13:15, declaring that the Qumran group, having abandoned the Temple sacrifices, held that prai sing God was more valuable than deeds (pp. 224-225). (8) We read in Num Rabbah parshah 18 a homily on this verse: "The Israelites said: Master of the world, when the Temple was standing we could bring an offering and receive atonement, but now we have only prayer [to achieve atonement." B. Nitzan in fact confirms explicitly my assumption in "Jewish Liturgy," p. 198. (9) D. K. Falk, Daily, Sabbath and Festival Prayers in the Dead Sea Scrolls (Leiden, 1998), questions whether the Yahad isolation from the Temple "ante dated the development of their liturgical prayers" (p. 240). He does not think that there is enough evidence either way. If indeed their liturgical prayers ante dated the isolation from the Temple, the entire issue of replacement of sacrifice by prayer would be pointless. (10) The same three motives are cited in yBerakhot 4: lb, 7a-b, as I shall note below.</page><page sequence="4">PAUL HEGER 216 [Gen[Gen 19: 27]"; the term "to stay" means simply "to pray" (11) [an important segment of the daily prayer is recited standing, and is called תפלח העמידה "the standing prayer"]. Isaac established the Minhah prayer [before sundown], as it is said, "And Isaac went out to meditate at the field at the eventide [Gen 24:63]"; the term שיחה means simply "to pray." Jacob established the Maariv prayer [after nightfall] as it is said, "and he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night [Gen[Gen 28:11]"; the term פגע means simply "to pray." (12) We observe that this homily does not establish a connection between prayer and sacrifices; prayer was instituted by the Patriarchs — that is, it was an ancient tradition — and is, therefore, an obligation to be fulfilled by every Israelite. The other sage, however, disputes this explanation, and declares: "The prayers were established as against [as a replacement for] the Tamid offerings." In mBerakhot 4:1 we find the time limits for the daily prayers, which hint at their linkage to the sacrifices: The morning prayer must be completed before midday, Rabbi Judah says before four hours [a third of the day], (13) The Minhah (14) prayer [must be completed] before the evening [at twilight, before sundown], Rabbi Judah says before half of the last quarter of the day [ten and one half hours]. The evening [night] prayer [after sundown] is not fixed. The fact that there is a specific evening prayer, תפלח הערב, confirms that the Minhah prayer, like the Minhah offering, must be performed before the evening and not at night. (15) (11) The relation of the two terms is supported by the text of Ps 106:30. The comparison of two similar words that may have totally dissimilar meanings in their contexts is common in rabbinic exegesis. (12) Biblical support of a type similar to that mentioned in the antecedent note is cited to justify the statements that the terms שיחה and פגיעה mean "prayer." (13) According to rabbinic and Qumran use, the day and the night are divided into twelve hours, independent of their actual length; in winter, there fore, every deemed "hour" of the day is shorter than an "hour" of the night, and vice versa in the summer. (14) Exod 29:35 -42 and Num 28:3-5 command two daily perpetual offe rings, one in the morning and one at twilight. The Rabbis call the twilight offe ring Minhah; since I am quoting their dicta, I use this term. In yBerkahot 4:1,7b, the text is more elaborate, quoting the relevant biblical command from Exod 29: 39 and Num 28:4 : "The morning prayer [we deduce] from the morning Tamid [as it is written] 'one lamb you should offer in the morning' and the Minhah prayer from the twilight Tamid [as it is written] 'and the other lamb you should offer at twilight" (15) The terms ערב and בין הערבים are not always clearly defined in Scripture.</page><page sequence="5">217 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? BavliBavli Berakhot 27b, (16) citing a baraita, clarifies the last vague part of the mishnah: What does it mean "the evening prayer is not fixed"? Does it mean that one could pray during the entire night, if one wishes? [No, it could not be, because in that case, the mishnah should have said] the evening prayer [could be completed during] the entire night. Then what does it mean it is not fixed? [We must assume that there is no obligation for this prayer, and the mishnah] concurs with the Tanna who said that the evening prayer is a voluntary prayer: Rav Judah said in the name of Samuel that Rabban Gamaliel says that the evening prayer is obliga tory, and Rabbi Joshua says that it is voluntary. The explicit association of the daily obligatory prayers as a replacement for the Tamid offerings is elucidated in the comments on the above mishnah in bBerakhot 26b: Why have they said [in the mishnah] that the morning prayer must be completed before midday? Because the morning Tamid is performed until midday; Rabbi Judah says until four hours, because [in his opinion] the morning Tamid must be completed before the fourth hour. And why have they said [in the mishnah] that the Minhah prayer must be completed before sundown? Because the evening Minhah must be completed before sundown [between the beginning of the sun's decline and sundown]; Rabbi Judah says before half of the last quarter of the day, because the Minhah offering must be completed before that time. This opinion indisputably establishes the replacement of the obligatory Tamid by prayers that are performed at exactly the same time as the relevant sacrifices. And since no sacrifices are performed during the night, the night prayer is not an obligatory prayer. Further, it is beyond doubt that this opinion must be perceived as relating to the obligatory daily Tamid offerings and the related offe rings for Sabbath and festive days, which are decreed to be offered perpetually at fixed times. Such prayers cannot be considered as a replacement for individual sin and voluntary offerings, which have no fixed times and are contingent upon the commission of trans gressions or spontaneous emotion. Confessions and supplication for forgiveness in rabbinic prayers, similar to Qumran confessions, are of a generic character, and do not refer to specific sins; the confes (16) In yBerakhot 4: 1, 7b, we find the same idea in a different literary style. Interestingly, there is no mention in this rhetoric the three prayers mentioned in Dan 6: 11 (v. 10 in KJV), quoted in a rhetorical discussion in bBerakhotbBerakhot 31a, nor the three daily prayers cited in Ps 55:18. There may have been in Israel an ancient, non-institutionalized custom for individuals to pray three times daily. It is plausible that the sages ignored this custom when they fixed the elaborate texts of the daily prayers.</page><page sequence="6">PAUL HEGER 218 sions must be discerned from the sin offerings that were due for involuntary transgressions of precise and well-defined decrees. (17) Rabban Gamaliel likely thought that the prayers were an ancient tradition, as in the second sage's opinion cited above, and therefore the evening prayer, alleged to have been instituted by Jacob, is obli gatory. (See another hypothesis regarding Rabban Gamaliel's motive at the end of the study.) A third rabbinic opinion is more similar to the Qumran view point, as I will demonstrate further on. We read a declaration of Rabbi Samuel son of Nakhman in Gen Rabbah (Theodor-Albeck), parshahparshah 68 that is in opposition to the above dicta: (18) [Prayers] must be recited three times daily, at the [cosmological] changes of the day. In the evening/after nightfall one must recite: "Let it be your will, Lord, my God, to lead me out from darkness to light"; in the morning one must recite: "I thank you, Lord, my God, for having led me out from darkness to light"; in the evening/ before sundown one must recite: "Let it be your will. Lord my God, to find me worthy to see the sundown, just as you found me worthy to see the rise of the sun." In summary, there are three different rabbinic opinions about the institution of prayer. Two have no association whatsoever with the replacement of sacrifices. One of these alleges that each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer and therefore there are three obli gatory daily prayers; the other associates the three daily prayers with the three cosmological changes during the full cycle of day and night. The latter opinion has some affinity with Qumran ideology and its belief in an all-embracing cosmology that underlies the solar calendar and other cult phenomena. The third rabbinic opinion clearly perceives the institution of prayer as a substitution for the obligatory Tamid, the daily perpetual offering; in this case, however, only two daily prayers are required, one in the morning and one in the late afternoon before sundown, since these are the required number and appropriate points in time of the sacrifices that are replaced. Rabbi Joshua, who maintained that the evening/night prayer is not obligatory, likely assumed that since there are no offe rings at night/after sundown, there is no obligation for a prayer at this time. (17) The rabbinic homily on Hosea 14: 3 cited above, which states that prayer serves as atonement for sins, does not contradict this statement. Rabbinic homilies are not always consistent. Further, these confessions do not refer to specific sins, for which a sin offering would be due; rather, they are of a generic character (see also n. 43). (18) This dictum appears in yBerakhot 4:1,7a, in a slightly different lite rary style.</page><page sequence="7">219 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? Established rabbinic halakhah also declares that the evening prayer is not obligatory, (19) thus confirming the idea that prayer replaced sacrifices. Similarly, the additional obligatory offerings for Sabbath and holidays, named מוספים "added" in rabbinic literature, are also replaced by "additional prayers" on these days, and their timing similarly corresponds to the allotted times for those sacri fices. We read in the continuation of the above-cited mBerakhot 4: 1: "The Mussaf prayers [can be completed] all day; Rabbi Judah says [only] until the seventh hour [seven out of twelve hours of the day]." In bBerakhot 26b there is an explanation of this dictum: "Why have they said [in the mishnah] that the Mussaf prayers can be completed all day? Because the Mussaf sacrifice can be performed all day; Rabbi Judah says until the seventh hour, because [in his opinion] the Musssaf offering must be completed before the seventh hour." From the above it is evident that the replacement of the obliga tory Tamid offerings by prayer requires only two daily prayers, one in the morning and one at twilight, with three prayers on Sabbath and holidays. All prayers must be completed at exactly the point in time when the relevant offerings were performed. Accordingly, there are no obligatory prayers at night. We observe, in fact, that Judith's Judith's prayers (at the time of the incense celebration) took place avrfjç ècrcépaç "eve [when the sun is in the west]" (Judith 9:1) and at rcpôç tt!v éo)01vf|v (jroXaicriç "the early morning guard" (12:5). Qumran Prayers a. Times for Prayer Qumran also required only two prayers; in this case, however, one was in the morning and one at night, contrary to the rabbinic halakhah. From the text of 4Q503, Daily Prayers, it is obvious that the Qumran prayers were set בצאח השמש "at sunrise" and בערב "the evening," which is clearly defined in that document as לילה "at night." It is true that this identification of the evening with the night is unmistakably validated only in Frags. 1-3:6-7; Frags. 29-32: 2-4, 22 - 23; Frags. 33-35 1:18-19; Frags. 48-50:3-5; Frags. 51-55:6-10; and Frag. 64:1-4; due to the many lacunae in the text, only the term לילה appears in other fragments, which also confirms that the prayers are to be said at night. (20) These Qumran prayers in the morning and at night (not before sundown, the time of the Minhah (19) See Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hil. Tefillah U-Nesiat Kapayim, 1:6. (20) Other Qumran writings attest to the meaning of "night" (i.e. after sunset) for the term ערב in reference to hymns and prayers. See, e.g.1QM XIV: 13-14; 4Q258; 4QSd IX: 9-10; and 1QH" XX: 4-7.</page><page sequence="8">PAUL HEGER 220 offering) could therefore not be a substitution for the daily obliga tory Tamid offerings, (21) nor for the additional Sabbath and holiday offerings that are performed in the morning and in the afternoon. (22) b. Cosmological Theory In addition to this clear textual reference to prayers in the morning and at night, the overall Qumran theology is founded upon the polarities of day and night, light and darkness. Thus prayers at the rising of the sun, the source of light, and at nightfall, the domain of darkness, also fit into this ideology; other ritual phenomena correspond to these cosmological changes as well. The dualistic Qumran concept of light and darkness, and the struggle between them, are well known, (23) and I will therefore limit my discussion to ritual matters. The emphasis on לילה "night" and חושך "darkness," associated with prayer or the blessing of the Deity, appears often in Qumran writings. We may note in particular 1QS IX: 26 - X: 1- 2 and 1QH" XX:XX: 4-7. Many other instances can be cited to show this relationship of night and darkness to prayers and blessing, (24) which suggests their near-obsessive importance in Qumran ideology. This emphasis on the duality of light and darkness is also underscored by the use of the same attribute, "dominion" to describe both. In IQS X 1:2, the light bears the attribute "the domi nion" of light, and in 4Q408, Morning and Evening Prayer, v. 10, we (21) In Scripture the Tamid and the additional holiday offerings are the only obligatory public offerings; therefore, these are the sacrifices that must be replaced. (22) E. Chazon, "Prayer Texts," pp. 219-220, and J. H. Charlesworth, ed., Dead Dead Sea Scrolls, Selections, Princeton Theological Seminary Dead Sea Scrolls Project (Tubingen, 1997), Vol. 4 A, p. 235, both conclude that the evening prayer in Qumran was recited after sunset, but consider it the first daily prayer at the beginning of the next day, and consider the morning prayer to be the second daily prayer. This interpretation does not correspond to the biblically appointed time for the Tamid offerings of בין הערבים, "at twilight," and is in blatant conflict with the reverse order of these offerings as stated in Exod. 29:38-39. (23) A. Steudel, "4Q408: A Liturgy on Morning and Evening Prayer Preli minary Edition," RevQ 16/65 (1994), 313-334, in fact identifies a document as typical of Qumran on the basis of the terms ממשלת אור and ממשלח חושך "the dominion of darkness and light." See further note 38 infra, and D. Falk, Prayers, p. 97. (24) The concept of לילה "night" appears in: 1QM XIV: 13; 1QH" XX: 6-7; 4Q2164Q216 (Jub.) 6: 6; 4Q258 IX: 9-10; 4Q299 Frag. 5 : 4; 4Q317 Frag. 1 „ (many times); 4Q334 Frag. 2:2 and 4; 4Q392 Frag. 1:4 and 6; 4Q427 (4QH") Frags. 2+3 u: 7-8; and 4Q503 (many occurrences). The concept of חושך "darkness" appears in lQHaXX: 6-l;4Q26Ô II: 1 ; 4Q392 Frag. 1:4 and 6;4Q503 (many occurrences); and 11Q17X: 5, in addition to those instances cited in the text.</page><page sequence="9">221 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? read: "as you created the evening as a sign of the appearance of the dominion of darkness." The term ערב "evening" really means night, being associated with darkness, which is characteristic of night. Other instances in which we observe this association and the term ערב as night are found in 4Q258 (4QSd) IX: 9-10; (25) 4Q427 (4Q H")H") Frags. 2+3II: 6-7; and 4Q503 Daily Prayers, Frags.33-35 1:19. In contrast, the terms "dominion of light" and "dominion of darkness'1 do not appear in Scripture, or in rabbinic literature; rather, "domi nion of day" and "dominion of night" are used, as in Gen 1:16 and Gen Gen 1:18. The term חושך "darkness" in Scripture usually has a nega tive connotation. (26) Thus the rabbinic blessing "I form the light and create darkness" is questioned in rabbinic literature, and is justi fied only because it repeats the exact words of Isa 45: 7. (27) The "dominion of darkness" appears only in Qumran literature in rela tion to prayers and/ or blessings of the Deity. In summary, cosmological cycles were a cornerstone of Qumran theology and the foundation of its rituals. Rachel Elior,Elior, (28) discussing Qumran1 s all-embracing cosmology, asserts that the Qumran solar calendar used for ritual purpose was founded upon cosmological cycles. (29) Sacrifices offered at the correct calendar times, founded upon the divinely regulated solar cycles, ensured the continuous and regular occurrence of these cycles. The entire world order depended upon accurate performance of the sacrifices; incorrectly offered sacrifices could have cataclysmic effects. The solar calendar and its cyclical rhythms constituted the pattern of Sacred Time, as Elior (30) describes at length; this concept added a cosmological significance to the cult ceremonies of the Temple. Similarly, the recurring sevenfold patterns in the ritual (25) It is obvious that we have here a poetic parallel, and the "evening" in one strophe corresponds to the "night" in the second. (26) One of the plagues on Egypt was darkness (Exod 10: 22). See also EzekEzek 32:8; Joel 2:2; Amos 5:20; Nahum 1:8; and Zeph 1:15. (27) Mishnah Berakhot 1: 4 declares that one must recite two blessings every morning, before the Amidah (standing prayer). Bavli Berakhot 11a speci fies that these blessings are "I form the light and create darkness." It is then asked (lib): "Let us say 'form the light and create brilliance' [i.e. a euphemism, since it is not appropriate to say that God created something evil]. [The response is]: We recite [the words as stated because this is] the exact text of Scripture." We observe that the rabbinic attitude toward darkness, at prayer and as a divine creation, is in utter opposition to Qumran's Weltanschauung.

VanderKam, Calendars in the the Dead Sea Scrolls (New York, 1998), who discusses the harmonization of the divine cosmological plan with the cultic reality of the Temple (pp. 115 ff.)</page><page sequence="10">PAUL HEGER 222 order (Sabbath, the seven days of the week, the cycles of seven weeks, the seven and forty-nine years of the Jubilee) were also linked to the cosmological order and ensured the continuity of the eternal cycles of nature. In light of this ideology, we can understand the prominent concern of the Qumran group with the cycles of day and night, light and darkness, in their writings, and particularly in their prayers and blessings of the Deity. It is this concern with the daily cosmological cycle, and not the replacement of the obligatory sacrifices, that explains the timing of the prayers in Qumran,s daily liturgy. (31) The Rabbis, (32) in contrast, had no belief like the quasi Gnostic doctrine that man's behaviour influences cosmological events. In their view, God had promised to uphold the world,s natural cycles independent of human mischief. This is reflected in Gen Gen 8: 21-22: "I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever destroy every living creature as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease." Ps 115:16 may also have influenced their division between God and humans with respect to the boundary of authority and responsibility. A homily in bSukkahbSukkah 5a sheds light on the rabbinic perception of this verse: "Rabbi Yosi says: The Divine presence never came down [to earth] and Moses and Elijah never went up to heaven, as it is said: 'The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to human beings.'" When contradictory biblical evidence is offered, a résolu tion is proposed: "[God did not tread on the earth;] He stood ten hand-breadths (33) above it [and similarly ten hand-breadths divided Moses and Elijah from heaven." This homily cannot be (31) Contra J. H. Charlesworth, Dead Sea Scrolls, Vol. 4 A, who remarks on the oddity that the sunrise "is the prevalent motif in the Qumran prayers," in contrast to the biblical references to prayers that are "rarely seen as a reminder to praise God" (p. 237). A. R. C. Leaney, The Rule of Qumran and its Meaning (London, 1966), notes Josephus' comment in Wars II: 128: before the sun is up the Esssenes recite certain prayers acmep iKexewvxeç àvaxeîXai "as though entreating him to rise" (transi. H. St. J. Thackeray, Loeb Classical Library). (32) Given the variety of viewpoints tolerated among the Rabbis, there may have been some who did believe in the linkage between man's deeds and cosmological events; but this was not the mainstream view of this group. The Rabbis ignored the apocryphal writings and their cosmological approach, and thus ensured their disappearance from the corpus of Jewish texts. (33) According to rabbinic legal theory, items that are divided from one another by a space of more than ten hand-breadths are deemed to be separated. Being separated from earth by ten hand-breadths, God was legally not "on" earth; similarly, Moses and Elijah were not "in" heaven.</page><page sequence="11">223 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? taken in an anthropomorphic sense; rather, it is a metaphor with significant import. That is, although God is both transcendent and immanent according to Jewish theology, being constantly involved in matters of this world, an abstract boundary exists between these two attributes. Humans, therefore, are endowed with the authority to interpret the Torah and fix the dates of holidays even in conflict with the cosmological cycles. (34) The Significance of □שפחי "lips" at Qunuran We must now address the issue of whether the term □שפחי, "the offering of the lips," in 1QSIX: 4-5 and 7 QS X: 6 necessarily refers to obligatory prayer. In 1QS X: 6, for example, it is followed by the term "I shall bless him"; here it is highly debatable whether the term relates to an obligation for prayer, as in 4Q503, or whether it repre sents a voluntary pledge to praise God at every occasion. The style of 4Q5034Q503 seems to be jussive: "they shall bless; starting to speak they shall say..." (Frag. 4:1); this is an explicit command to recite a parti cular text every morning and night. In contrast, in 1QS IX: 4-5 and 1QSX: 1QSX: 1QSX: 6 (35) there is no text to be recited; the first, as I argue below, does not refer to prayer, and the second consists of an instruction to pray at the festivals, not a prayer itself. Similarly, the style of 4Q266 X: 8-9 suggests an undertaking: "and my tongue to be a fruit of eulogy, and a portion of my lips. I will sing with knowledge"This passage refers to the beginning of the seventh year; it does not seem to be a specific decree to pray, but is offered as hortatory guidance, like the Hodayot. Moreover, both passages seem to refer to an individual, not to the public, whereas the Tamid offerings are public obligations. a. The Term משפט in Context I suggest that the relevant verses need not refer to prayer. The meaning depends on the context, and in our passages the context is related to teaching. The term □שפחי in our verses 1 QS IX: 4-5 and 1QS 1QS X:6 is associated with the concept of משפט, which I would translate as "the offering of the lips to teach the law [will be deemed] like the pleasant aroma of justice." In 1QS X: 9 the term (34) See Heger, The Pluralistic Halakhah. Legal Innovations in the Late Second Second Commonwealth and Rabbinic Periods, Studia Judaica 22 (Berlin, 2003), pp. 64,66-67 for relevant citations and explanations. (35) Cf D. Falk, Prayers, pp. 214-215, who writes: "It is probable that the prayers referred to in 1QS 10:5b-8,4Q409, and 4Q510-11 include these [hymns from llQPsa] along with perhaps songs of praise." But he too maintains that the text is not a prayer.</page><page sequence="12">PAUL HEGER 224 בקו משפטו should be translated as "in its correct measure" or "correctly" (36) The term משפט appears 615 times in Qumran writings and has an array of meanings: it may refer to a court case, an accusation or a verdict; it may mean "the law" in general, or "according to the law" "rightly" or "correctly,'י "against the law" or "castigation by law"; it may also imply the day of reckoning (the last judgment). The use of the term משפט as law in the sense of rules is also common in Scripture, as in Exod 21:1: "And these are the rules you should set before them," and in Lev 18: 5: "Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them." and Ezek 20: 11 repeats this verse, and the term must also be interpreted here as "laws/rules"laws/rulesand not "judgments." A number of Qumran occurrences in which the meaning is clearly "law" support the translation of in 1QS IX: 4-5 as "to teach the law," an important activity at Qumran. We read in 1QS V: 15-16, for example: "None of the men of the Community should acquiesce to their authority in any law or regulation." Similarly, teaching or reciting the law is encouraged as a virtuous act, as in and 1 QS X: 10: "and when evening and morning depart I shall repeat his precepts." Like other worthy acts, this one is repeated often in the Rule of the Community,Community, indicating its importance. We may note, for instance, the use of משפט in the Rule of the Community VI: 15, in VI: 22, and in VIII: 9, which is translated by Garcia Martinez as "for Aaron with eternal knowledge of the covenant of justice and in order to offer a pleasant aroma." I would translate the term משפט in the latter case as "law" or "rules" implying that the priests have the authority and the privilege to decide the interpretation of the law (which recalls the use of this term in Deut 17:8), and to perform the offerings. However we interpret the term נגע in Deut 17:8, (37) it is evident from the biblical context that it includes both judgments between people and general rulings with respect to biblical commands unre lated to justice. Qumran writings, from their context, definitely (36) D. Falk, Prayers, translates 1QSX: 9 as "and the flute of my lips I will raise as the cord of his judgment." He admits that "the common understanding that בקו משפטו refers to a standard for the performance of praise, that is, 'right' praise"; but he interprets it here as judgment, because in the subsequent text of v. 11, "I acknowledge his judgment to be right," the term משפט unquestionably means judgment (pp. 108-109). This assertion, however, has no basis in this context, since the first term appears in association with other musical terms, while the second refers to a new and entirely different subject. Garcia Martinez and Tigchelaar correctly interpret the first instance in our passage as "its correct measure," and the second as "judgment." (37) There are different translations and opinions on the meaning of the term נגע in this verse.</page><page sequence="13">225 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? understood נגע as "skin infection," and משפט as "law" or "rules." (38) In the following instances the context undeniably indi cates the meaning of the term משפט as law, and not as judgments: 4Q2664Q266 f 101:1; 4Q271 Frag. 4II: 13; 4Q372 Frag. 3:5; 4Q381 Frag. 1: 1; 4Q394 Frag. 8 IV: 2-3; and 4Q270 Frag. 7 II: 12. Following from the interpretation of משפט in our verses as "law" the expression חרומו! שפתים must indicate here the teaching of the law. (39) The term "lips" is used in Qumran literature in refe rence to both correct and incorrect teaching of the law, and is derived from biblical quotations. Correct teaching, described by the term "offering of the lips," is carried out primarily by the priests, and is taken from Mai 2: 7: "For the priesfs lips keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth." Incorrect teaching, called שפתי הלקוח, corresponds to Ps 12:4: "the Lord shall cut off fictitious lips [speaking]." The use of the same term for the two opposing concepts may have been deduced from the polarity in Prov 18: 24 (v. 21 in KJV): "Death and life are in the power of the tongue" It is interesting that these terms, which stress the importance of speech in all its manifestations, also fit within Qumran's philosophy and regulations. Finally, the literary structure of 1QS IX: 3-5 indicates unmista kably that the activity of "the offering of the lips'5 does not refer to prayer at all. Vv. 1-4 describe a penitent who was punished and tested for two years to ensure his repentance; they then conclude with the dictum that various types of virtuous behaviour atone for sins. (40) Verse 3, "when these in Israel," starts a new point and constitutes the protasis, realized in the apodosis, "to atone for the guilt of iniquity." A new theme (41) then begins in a different, straightforward decla ratory style: "and the offering of the lips will be like the pleasant aroma of justice." Hence the offering of the lips is not connected to sacrifices, but to its ideologically correlated "aroma of justice." The (38) CD-A XIII: 4-7 substantiates this statement. (39) P. Wernberg-Moller, The Manual of Discipline (Leiden, 1957), does not interpret this term (p. 35). In his commentary he stresses the fact that the circles behind 1QS did not practise a sacrificial cult (p. 133). J. Licht, Manual of Discipline Discipline [Hebrew], (Jerusalem, 1965), attempts a rather far-fetched explana tion of the apparent conflict between "lips," meaning prayer, and the odd למשפט, suggesting the following reading: the offering of the lips will be deemed a favourable plea at the time of God's judgment. Thus in his view prayer does not replaces sacrifice. (40) Cf. C. Newsom, Songs, p. 62, who writes: "Atonement was effected through the community's prayer, praise and obedience to the law." These are components of a virtuous life that brings about atonement; prayer as such is not a substitute for sin offerings. (41) This is also how J. H. Charlesworth, Dead Sea Scrolls, Vol. 4A, divided the text (p. 38).</page><page sequence="14">PAUL HEGER 226 succeeding statement "and the perfectness of behaviour" serves as evidence that the entire lemma from beginning to end refers to correct behaviour. "Teaching the law" is intrinsically associated with correct behaviour, like the antecedent verses, and with the succee ding "and the perfectness of behaviour." An interpretation of "prayer" here would interpose an irregular, unrelated element. b. Virtuous Deeds Compared to Offerings I must note here an apparent contradiction to my thesis in 1QS IX: 3-5: teaching the law is deemed equal to a voluntary offering, thus suggesting a connection between prayer and sacrifice. A similar concept is found in the text of 11Q5 XVIII 9-12: "The person who gives glory to the Most High is accepted like one who brings an offe ring, like one who offers rams and calves, like one who makes the altar greasy with many holocausts, like the sweet fragrance from the hand of just ones" This text seems to contradict the thesis that prayer is not a substitute for the Tamid offerings, the obligatory public daily sacrifices, at Qumran. 11Q5 11Q5 XVIII 9-12 does not, however, refer to prayer, or to the public. From the context one understands that the author encourages and extols the individual who glorifies God and proclaims his power to the ordinary people; (42) the act of glorifying God is enhanced through its comparison to the bringing of offerings. Like the volun tary offerings, this act is not stated to be obligatory. It is a virtuous deed, comparable to bringing offerings, and the author encourages it through this comparison; he does not, however, promote a replace ment of one action by another. I think we must understand 1 QS IX: 3-5 in a similar way: teaching the Law in 1 QS and glorifying God in 11QT 11QT 11QTare both deemed to be equal to voluntary offerings; sacrifice is not excluded, and there is no suggestion that one is relieved from the duty of obligatory sacrifice or the bringing of a voluntary sacrifice. We might say that repentance and establishing a spirit of holiness atone for sins, thus equating an individual sin offering and voluntary holocaust and fellowship offerings. (43) But neither of these acts (42) We read in w. 1- 5 of this document: "To glorify the Most High join together to make his salvation known and do not hesitate to proclaim his power and his glory to all ordinary people. For, wisdom has been granted in order to make the Lord's glory known , and in order to recount his many deeds she has been taught to man: to make his power known to ordinary people, to instruct his greatness to those lacking judgment." (43) Based on w. 3 and 4 of our passage: "When these exist in Israel in accordance with these rules in order to establish the spirit of holiness in truth eternal in order to atone for the guilt of iniquity and for the unfaithfulness of sin, and for the approval of the earth without the flesh of burnt offerings and without the fat of sacrifices." Though this passage follows instructions for repen tance for an involuntary sinner, I have some doubt as to whether these verses</page><page sequence="15">DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? 227 refers to public institutionalized prayer at fixed cosmological cycles, comparable to the obligatory Tamid offerings. In contrast, The Songs Songs Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifices (4Q400), (44) the Daily Prayers (4Q503),(4Q503), (45) and the Words of the Luminaries and Festival Prayers (4Q504-509)(4Q504-509) seem to be obligatory prayers, but do not mention a replacement of offerings. Nor do other Qumran verses referring to atonement suggest a replacement for sacrifice. (46) The Songs of the Sabbath Sabbath Sacrifices do not replace the particular Sabbath offe rings. (47) If they were meant to be sung at the Temple, or in post Temple rituals (48) like the daily songs set out in rabbinic literature (mTamid(mTamid 7: 4), they were an accompaniment to the offerings, not a substitute. (49) The particular songs/prayers (50) of the Words of the Luminaries (51) and Festival Prayers, which may appear to be asso conclude these instructions and refer to a specific sin by an individual member of the community. I suggest instead that the literary style of the opening phrase suggests a new theme, referring to the behaviour of the public, and not to a specific sin for which a sin offering must be brought for atonement. (44) C. Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice (Atlanta, 1958), assumes that the Songs were not stipulated for public use, taking "the repeated heading of "The Instructor' as a reference to this Qumran functionary" (p. 3). (45) J. H. Charlesworth, Dead Sea Scrolls, Vol. 4A states that "the bles sings [in 4Q503] are clearly intended for corporate worship rather than personal devotional practice" (p. 235). (46) In 1QS XI: 14-15 and in 4Q264 1-2, for example, atonement will be achieved by divine goodness and mercy. This is similar to rabbinic liturgy. (47) C. Newsom, Songs, perceives them as a vehicle to achieve a particular kind of religious experience, "a sense of being in the heavenly sanctuary and in the presence of the angelic priests and worshippers... an ecstatic experience among some worshippers" (p. 17). In her opinion, the "quasi-mystical Shirot" were recited only on Sabbaths and certain holidays, because "this type of litur gical communion with the angels was perceived as characteristic of the special nature of the Sabbaths" (p. 21).They were thus not a substitute for the particular Sabbath and holiday offerings. (48) D. Falk, Prayers, assumes that they "served as accompaniments used by the earthly priestly community to the heavenly altar service" (p. 148). (49) D. Falk, Prayers, p. 149, writes that they are not evidence for "a repla cement of the Temple cult... it suggests instead attempts to preserve elements of priestly liturgy." He further states: "the prayers would thus serve as tokens of the Temple service, making it natural to apply sacrificial language to them''; if the prayers were only a "token" of the Temple service, the appropriate times would not have to be identical. See also p. 153 on this issue. (50) It is not within the scope of this study to establish the exact character of these hymns. It suffices for our purpose to prove that they were not intended as a replacement for sacrifices. (51) D. T. Olson, in his introduction to the "Words of the Lights," in Dead Sea Sea Scrolls, Vol. 4A, pp. 107-53, ed. J. H. Charlesworth (Tubingen, 1997), posits that these liturgies are associated with "the daily and monthly cycles of 'Lights' including the sun, moon, and stars," or that "the 'Lights' refer to the priests, who are seen as intermediaries of the heavenly light from God" (p. 108). Hence, like the prayers of 4Q503, they are associated with cosmological cycles, and not with sacrifices.</page><page sequence="16">PAUL HEGER 228 dated with or a replacement for the particular festival offerings, are not connected with the sacrifices, but with characteristic Sabbath and festival themes. (52) Further evidence for the separation of these hymns from the offerings is manifested in HQPsa XXVII: 5-9: "... to sing before the Tamid altar every day of the year, three hundred sixty-four, and for the offerings of the Sabbath fifty two songs and for the offerings of the New Moon and of all the holidays and of the Day of Atonement thirty songs; and the total of the songs that he composed was four hundred and forty-six." The thirty parti cular offerings are: twelve for the New Moons, fifteen for the Passover (7), Sukkot (7) and Assembly (1), and one each for the Feast of Weeks, Memorial of the Trumpets (New Year) and Day of Atonement. (53) Interestingly, unlike the Temple Scroll, there are no special songs for the additional festivals and their particular offe rings that are mentioned in the latter: the Waving of the Sheaf, (54) the First Fruits of wine and oil, the wood offerings, and the annual seven days of consecration (11QT XV and XVI). A great array of special offerings is provided for these particular events in the Temple Temple Scroll, but no additional songs seem to have been composed for them, as they were for the various "official" holidays cited in Scripture. I conjecture that this difference is due to the fact that they were not endowed with the specific character of "official" holidays; no limitation of work was imposed for these "New Festivals" (55) We thus observe that the particular songs are connected not with the offerings, but with the special character of the holidays. (56) (52) See D. Falk, Prayers, pp. 52,150-152. (53) D. Falk, Prayers, includes Passover (1) and Unleavened Bread (7), and omits the Festival of Trumpets. His motive is unclear, since there are no special public offerings for the evening before the Unleavend Bread festival; the Passover offering is not a public offering. 11QT XXV: 1-9, it must be noted, mentions the "memorial of the trumpet" festival, its character as a holiday and its particular offerings. (54) Baillet, DJD VII pp.177-184, suggests that the phrase "the produce of our land in order to wave" refers to the Waving of the Sheaf festival. In the rele vant fragment (in 4Q508, Frag. 22+23:3, with different identification numbers) the phrase clearly appears after the prayer entitled "Prayer for the Feast of Booths" (reconstructed) in v. 2; hence it could not apply to the much earlier Waving of the Sheaf in the ritual calendar. It may relate to the ceremony of brin ging first fruits in a basket as described in Deut 26:1-15; this has no fixed date, particularly with respect to the solemn declaration to be made once every three years (w. 12-15). (55) I discuss this point in more detail in my forthcoming book. (56) I also disagree, therefore, with B. Nitzan's conjecture in Qutnran Prayer Prayer and Religious Poetry (Leiden, 1994), p. 293, n. 67 that the Sabbath prayers in the Words of the Luminaries and the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice may have been used as a substitute for the particular Sabbath sacrifices. As I have</page><page sequence="17">229 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? c. Is The General Concept of Substitution Consistent with Qumran Principles?Principles? I hypothesize that the general concept of replacement, and the similarly motivated theory that a precept can be performed by proxy, are characteristic of rabbinic methods. (57) Ibese concepts were devised for practical reasons, and conditioned by the particular rabbinic mode of scriptural interpretation and the consequent nature of their halakhic decisions. This is quite different from the essence of Qumran halakhah. One major example of this difference, as I have argued elsewhere, is the rabbinic ruling that saving a life overrides the Sabbath rules; in contrast, Qumran halakhah does not allow this. (58) It is my strong impression (the substantiation of which will require thorough research) that practical considerations were alien to Qumran,s basic philosophy; they were not a factor to be considered so as to allow decisions against the law. The Qumran mode of interpretation is generally much more linked to the simple and straightforward understanding of the text than that of the Rabbis. (59) Assuming this is correct, one would need explicit and unquestionable evidence in Qumran literature pointing to the replacement of one precept by another. We have observed that when there is any association of songs, prayer, or other virtuous deeds with sacrifices in Qumran literature, it is expressed merely as comparison, not as a replacement. There is no hint that the compared sacrifices were to be annulled; according to most scholars, Qumran expected to return to the Temple system of offerings when these were performed according to their beliefs and opinions. The assumed connection with the angels and the elevated status of their holy community were temporary procedures, imposed upon them demonstrated, such songs and prayers could not be a substitute for the daily Tamid because of their different times, and similarly could not have been a replacement for the obligatory Sabbath sacrifices. (57) For example, the people are deemed to have accomplished the duty of prayer by listening to the leader's prayer, and reciting the expression Amen at the end of each blessing. In contrast, we observe from the War Scroll 4Q491 and 4Q492, Frag. 8-101:2 that the people recited the entire blessing. (58) This is my interpretation of CD-A XI: 16-17 and 4Q265, Frag. 71:7-8, substantiated in my next book, and contra Lutz Doering, "New Aspects of Qumran Sabbath Law" in Legal Texts and Legal Issues. Proceedings of the Second Second Meeting of the International Organization for Qumran Studies, pp. 251 274 (New York, 1997), at p. 264. Qumran did not take into account practical considerations in its halakhic decisions; this is demonstrated, for instance, in 11QT 11QT LII: 13-14, requiring a distance equal to three days' walk for a secular slaughter of animals outside the Temple precinct. (59) This is discussed in my article "Qumran Exegesis: 'Rewritten Torah' or Interpretation?" RevQ 22/85 (2005) 61-135, and in more detail in my forth coming book.</page><page sequence="18">PAUL HEGER 230 by circumstances, and not as permanent replacements for the sacri fices. (Christian theology, in contrast, considered Jesus5 sacrifice as finally relieving the believers from the duty to bring offerings.) We note, for example, that the term "the offering of the lips" in 1QS 1QS IX: 3-5 referring to the teaching of the law is deemed prefe rable (60) to bringing voluntary offerings, rather than being a repla cement. Moreover, it logically cannot be perceived as a substitute; a substitute is usually considered a lesser, or, at the most, equal alter native. (Interestingly, glorifying God is deemed merely equal to voluntary sacrifice, as in 11Q5 XVIII 9-12.) Comparison Comparison of the Different Times for Evening Prayer in Rabbinic and and Qumran Literature: A New Proposal At this point, I would like to offer an afterthought with respect to the apparently different developments in prayer in the rabbinic and Qumran groups. Both Qumran and the Rabbis performed two obligatory daily prayers, but at different times. I postulate that on this specific issue the similarity between the two groups is greater than the disparity, and the explanation for the disparity has to do with two distinct rules. The recital of the Shema, the essential verses of Israelite mono theistic belief in Deut 6: 4-9, is a scriptural precept and must be recited in the correct scriptural order: first at night, ובשכבך "and when you lay down," and then in the early morning, ובקומך "and when you get up." This obligation was carried out in the same way by Qumran (61) and by the Rabbis, (62) and most likely by the Pharisees, the assumed disputants with Qumran. Qumran added other recitations, such as the Decalogue and benedictions, to the (60) In my opinion, the term "from the flesh of burnt offerings" has a comparative sense here, indicating that the flesh of offerings is inferior to the teaching of the law. (Contra Garcia Martinez, who translates "without the flesh.") Though the preposition מן has different meanings, as D. Falk notes in Prayers,Prayers, p. 240,1 think that in this occurrence it must be understood as "better than." (61) We observe that in 4Q503, the evening prayer comes first and is followed by the morning prayer. See also n. 22. (62) See mBerakhoth 1:1. The Rabbis also preferred the morning Shema to be at the earliest possible hour, as we learn from mBerakhot 1:2, bBerakhot 9b, yBerakhot 1:2, 3 and bBerakhot 29b; Ps 72: 5 serves as scriptural support. Zeal to accomplish the divine commands as early as possible was also praised by the Rabbis (bPesahim 4a); this serves as further encouragement for early prayer. One should thus not be surprised at the references to early prayer in Qumran. This would also answer D. T. Olson^ amazement, in his introduction to "Daily Prayers," in The Dead Sea Scrolls, Vol. 4A, pp. 235-85, ed. J. Charlesworth (Tubingen, 1997), that the "rising of the sun is rarely seen as a reminder to praise God in the Hebrew Bible" (p. 237).</page><page sequence="19">231 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? short and essential Shema; (63) this constituted the foundation of their prayers as well as dictating the order: at night and in the early morning. (64) With the progression of their segregation and the creation of a distinct theology, they developed their philosophy regarding light and darkness and applied it to various aspects of their belief, including prayers. Their custom of two daily prayers at night and in the morning thus concurs with Scripture, and would raise no questions. These prayers were founded exclusively upon the scriptural obligation and had no connection whatsoever with sacri ficialficial offerings; nor did the songs and blessings that were added for thanksgiving and God's glorification. In contrast, the songs that were sung during the performance of the sacrifices, such as the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, were complementary to the offerings (though not a substitute), and had no connection with obligatory prayers. The Rabbis also maintained the obligatory recital of Shema at night and in the morning. It seems from mTamid 5:1 (65) that the priests also recited it in the Temple in the early morning, together with the Decalogue, after the Tamid offering and before the burning of incense. As at Qumran, the recitation of the Shema and addi tional biblical verses and blessings was complementary to the offe ring and not a substitute. After the Temple's destruction, the Rabbis added the Amidah prayer (eighteen blessing for weekdays and seven blessings for Sabbath) to the obligatory Shema in the morning, and instituted the Amidah prayer in the afternoon — both as replacements for the morning and evening Tamid offerings. In this case, the relevant times commanded for the Tamid offerings were used; in contrast to the biblical timing required for the Shema, Scripture establishes the morning Tamid as the first, and the twilight offering as the second offering of the day. The different times for the Shema and the Amidah are founded upon two distinct biblical commands. Since the Shema was recited, according to Scripture, at nightfall, the Amidah was also added to the evening Shema. There fore, the nightly Amidah was not perceived as obligatory, since the Minhah offering was replaced by the afternoon Amidah prayer. The Shema recital, in contrast, was as always obligatory at night. The (63) See D. Falk, Prayers, pp. 113-124 for details of the additional benedic tions, confessions etc., and the relevant biblical quotations that substantiate them. It is not within the scope of this study to describe the developmental stages of these prayers. (64) See J .M. Baumgarten, "4Q503p. 404. (65) From the text of this Mishnah, as well as the motive for the special additional Sabbath prayer, we observe that the additional blessing on Sabbath was recited to accord with some particular characteristic of the day, and had no connection to the additional Sabbath offerings.</page><page sequence="20">PAUL HEGER 232 dispute among the Rabbis with respect to the evening prayer (discussed above) referred to the Amidah prayer, not to the Shema. I hypothesized in an earlier study that Rabban Gamaliel, who main tained that the evening Amidah was also obligatory, desired to attain a standardization of Israelite laws and customs, and such a provision would fit with his goal. In conclusion, from the fact that Qumran did not institute a twilight prayer, it is evident that their prayers at night and in the morning had no association with the Tamid offerings, and were not their replacement; their prayer obligations were founded exclusi vely upon the obligatory recital of the Shema, even after their seces sion from the Temple, and were thus performed at the appointed biblical times for the Shema. Conclusion:Conclusion: On the Use of Rabbinic Parallels In summary, we cannot confirm B. Nitzan's definite statement that in Qumran the prayers "had to be recited in such a manner as to replace the service of the sacrificial cult"(66) or Schiffman's explicit declaration that the prayer texts from Qumran testify that the morning and late afternoon prayers are analogous to the Temple sacrifices. I did not encounter in Qumran writings any indication that the obligatory prayers replaced the obligatory sacrifices at the Temple. At the most, we may conjecture that praising and glorifying God were perceived as equal to worship by voluntary offerings, but not a replacement; one does not exclude the other. But the most critical and decisive argument against the thesis that prayer replaced sacrifice is the timing of their prayers: these do not corres pond to the appointed times of the obligatory sacrifices. (67) Although we do not possess any explicit indication in Qumran writings that the Minhah offering was to be performed at twilight, (68) we need have no doubt that this indeed was their opinion. The precise time may have been different than that of the Rabbis, (69) but since Scripture uses the term "at twilight" for this offering, it could not in any event be performed at night, which was the time fixed for Qumran^ evening prayer. This term is used in (66) "Liturgy," p. 198. (67) J. M. Baumgarten, "4Q 503," posits that "the 15th as well as the 21st days appear to be festive days" (p. 399); but we do not encounter additional prayers for these days (like the rabbinically-instituted Mussaf prayers), as one would expect if the prayers were replacing the sacrifices. (68) The few places in which the term בין הערבים appears in Qumran writings are all reconstructions. Nonetheless, the reconstruction is reasonable in each case, since each refers to a biblical command in which this term appears. (69) As we have observed, though the exact time of the Minhah offering is also disputed among the Rabbis, it is never held to occur at night; the time is always before sunset.</page><page sequence="21">233 DID PRAYER REPLACE SACRIFICE AT QUMRAN ? Scripture only for these and for the Passover offerings, and is distinct from the term ערב, which usually means night, (70) or at least after sunset. (71) As I have demonstrated, Qumran prayers were unques tionably associated with the cosmological changes of day and night, and cannot be linked to the sacrifices that according to explicit scrip tural command must be performed during the day, starting in the morning. Nor is it clear that our Qumran passages are referring to prayer; as I have argued, based on aspects of style, context and philo logy, they are more likely referring to the teaching of law. It is extremely tempting to use rabbinic parallels to explain Qumran literature. This is particularly so with respect to 1QSIX 3 5. As I have argued above, the literary style and context of this passage indicate clearly that the correct behaviour of the Commu nity serves as atonement for sins, and replaces the voluntary offe rings. This notion, that a virtuous life (that is, the fulfillment of the divine decrees that involve all aspects of life) atones for uninten tional sins just like the sin offering, again has a parallel in rabbinic literature. We read in bYoma 86b that it is possible to reconcile with God, when one has committed a sin in secret, by words and repen tance; God deems this equal to bringing an offering. (72) This rabbinic homily is close in character, if not identical, to our passage in 1QSIX. When we consider other rabbinic homilies that similarly list a variety of deeds that replace sacrifices, (73) there is an over whelming similarity to the general premise in 1QS IX: 3-4: "When these exist in Israel in accordance with these rules in order to esta blish the spirit of holiness in truth eternal." Qumran describes one general, all-embracing concept of a righteous life, whereas the Rabbis enumerate its components. Nonetheless, we must be cautious; as I have argued above, the similarity goes only so far. Parallel rabbinic dicta can serve as an aid to understanding Qumran thought. But a meticulous scrutiny of the rabbinic writings can also indicate when the apparent parallel is not a parallel, and where the comparison ends. The replacement of sacrifices by prayer is one such occurrence. Paul Heger. (70) The wording of Num 9:15-16 provides clear evidence that ערב refers to night: "... from evening [ערב] until morning it [the cloud] was over the taber nacle, having the appearance of fire. It was always so: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night [לילה]." The ערב of v. 15 is complemented by the term לילה in v. 16. (71) The biblical phrase "and be unclean until the evening" means after sunset, as also appears in the relevant dictum in 4Q394, Frags. 3-7 1:18: "to be pure at sunset." (72) A more extended version is found in Lev Rabbah, parshah 7. (73) See, e.g. bMegillah 31b;</page></plain_text>
