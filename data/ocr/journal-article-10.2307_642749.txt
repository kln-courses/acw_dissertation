<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greece &amp; Rome, Vol. XXX, No. 1, April 1983 BRIEF REVIEWS (* denotes that a book is specially recommended for school libraries; ** that it is suitable for advanced students only; B that a bibliography is included.) Greek Literature C. W. Macleod's *Homer, Iliad XXIV1 must be the most rewarding scholarly commentary in English on Homer. While informed by much learning, articulated with a great precision, it is essentially literary-critical, in the spirit of Schadewaldt and Reinhardt on one side and Matthew Arnold on another. Symptomatically, the introduction begins in medias res with 'The Iliad as a tragic poem'. Sixty pages in all, the introduction is admirable, and not essentially impaired by the rather random selectivity of a section on style or a certain over-emphasis on Homer's compassion. Simone Weil's famous essay on the compassionate Homer is rightly acclaimed here, but, pace Weil, the 'tigerish lust to annihilate' (as Nietzsche called it) which possesses the Iliadic heroes is not simply rejected by the poet, or simply anything: the marvel of Homeric 'objectivity' is its inclusiveness. Nonetheless, Macleod's interpretation is deeply humane, and this can only be acclaimed in its turn. The commentary itself contains much to admire, including pointed comparisons with later literature (Greek and other) and some sensitive extended dis- cussions (e.g. on 448 ff., 518 ff.), though more attention might perhaps have been given to the distinctive atmosphere of 24, its eeriness and heavy tension. All in all, Macleod's volume is a pleasure to work with - pleasure tempered only by the sad circumstance that its publication is posthumous. Godfrey W. Bond's *Euripides, Heracles2 is also to be recommended, though for different reasons. The Heracles is a remarkable and much discussed play, yet one on which there has been no significant commentary since the famous work by Wilamowitz at the end of the last century. Bond's commentary therefore fills a gap, and on the whole fills it well. His is a traditional scholarly commentary: sound and informative, textually oriented (Bond, incidentally, prints Diggle's new OCT, on which see below), patient and methodical - sometimes too much so. Amphitryon's opening speech, for instance, though only 59 lines long and (as Bond says) notable for its clarity, gets not only its 6,000 words on detailed points, but a 300-word analysis of its structure. Does this mode of exposition imply concern for the youthful reader? If so, Bond forgets his concern surprisingly often and soon. Many undergraduates, not to mention sixth-formers, will be puzzled by the syntax of lines 20f., despite his aid, and wonder whether Bond expects them to know German (line 31). They may also wonder why the intro- duction had to be so short (18 pages), when the commentary is so long (over 350). Such a long commentary inevitably has its weak moments (especially on matters of style: e.g. vocaodrac xOovds in line 542 involves no 'rare and bold metaphor', but, as Bond's own examples show, a cliche - which is why Euripides can use vooUEv allusively of ordotgs), but also has some particular strengths, not least its helpful discussions of Euripides' rhetorical 'logic'. J. Diggle, *Euripidis Fabulae, tomus II,3 is the first published part of a new Oxford Classical Text of Euripides (a volume in defence of some of Diggle's textual decisions came out first: see G &amp; R 29 (1982), 88f.). It contains Supplices, Electra, Hercules, Troades, I.T., and Ion. Generations brought up on Gilbert Murray will find many changes. In the first 150 lines of I.T., for instance, there are well over twenty differences in the text (and many more in the apparatus), at least half of them consequential ones. Some of these (e.g. line 150) involve Diggle obelizing as corrupt what Murray allowed or emended: here, as often, Diggle commendably prefers honesty to factitious remedies, while still offering a judicious choice of suggestions in the apparatus. In 36-41, on the other hand, he copes with a vexed passage by making two separate deletions and exchanging one awkward hyperbaton for a worse one. Such answers might be right, but cannot be shown to be: they are really exempli gratia, and might usefully be labelled as such in the apparatus. Besides 'ordinary' corruptions, special difficulties confront editors of Euripides in the shape of textual dislocations and interpolations, often associated with actors' variant versions. Whether the sense of logical propriety which Diggle brings to these problems always accords with Euripides' may be doubted. On the whole, nevertheless, he has certainly given us a more Euripidean text than his predecessor and (with a much superior apparatus) a basis for improving it still further in the future. With *Vol. 2, Knights,4 and *Vol. 3, Clouds,5 of The Comedies of Aristophanes, Alan H. Sommerstein continues the good work</page><page sequence="2">88 BRIEF REVIEWS he began with the first volume in the series, Acharnians (reviewed in G &amp; R 28 (1981), 216). In essence these are updated, scholarly, and altogether superior replacements for Rogers's large editions. They offer independent text, accurate and intelligent facing translation (all prose, except for the lyrics), and economical notes. The notes generally explain what a reader might wonder about, rather than exploring what would hardly occur to him; and they tend to be notes to the English, rather than the Greek (the lemmata are in English). For this last reason in particular, Aristophanes' many stylistic shifts and nuances tend to go unremarked, albeit sometimes tacitly acknowledged in the translation, especially in the lyrics. Compared with Neil or Dover, Sommer- stein takes relatively little for granted: unlike Dover, for instance, he explains who Cleon is on his first mention in Nub. 549. Those new to Aristophanes, but not only those, will find his com- mentaries informative and thoughtful. A warm welcome to a new Loeb: D. A. Campbell, *Greek Lyric 1,6 the first instalment of a four-volume replacement for Edmonds's Lyra Graeca. Edmonds's contributions to the Loeb series were undeniably poor: capricious in text, perverse in translation, and only redeemed by extensive collections of ancient testimonia to the life and work of the authors treated. Since his time, in any case, many new fragments of Greek lyric have come to light. Campbell's first volume, containing the remains of Sappho and Alcaeus, happily pre- serves and extends Edmonds's testimonia, and adds scholarly text (based on Lobel-Page, whose numeration is followed), competent translation, and succinct notes. Greek lyric poetry, so attrac- tive and yet, in its fragmentariness, so problematic, has long deserved such a convenient present- ation. Herwig Maehler, Snell's successor as editor of the Teubner Pindar and Bacchylides, is now producing a full-scale edition and commentary on the latter. The complete work will be in two parts, the first of which, in two volumes, deals with Bacchylides' surviving epinicia: Die Lieder des Bakchylides: Erster Teil, Die Siegeslieder.7 Amazingly enough, the only major com- mentary on the poet until now has been Jebb's pioneering work of 1905, since when more fragments have been recovered and much thinking about choral lyric has taken place. Maehler's first volume contains the authoritative Teubner text of 1970 together with a facing German translation and a substantial introduction; his second contains the commentary, in which detailed treatment of each ode is preceded by a general discussion of its historical background, myth, and form or structure. In the commentary Maehler provides scrupulous discussion of textual, metrical, and interpretative points and ample linguistic and phraseological parallels, but (at the opposite pole to Macleod's Iliad 24) tends to ignore any formative aspects of Bacchylides' writing, including verbal interrelations (despite some useful preliminary remarks on Bacchylidean style in I. pp. 23 ff.), and to restrict discussion of any literary quality or qualities to passing comment under the headings of 'form' and 'myth' (e.g. II. p. 253 on Ode 13). Part of the explanation may be that he apparently (I. p. xi) subscribes to Bundy's Law of Encomiastic Reduction ('there is no passage in Pindar and Bakkhulides that is not in its primary intent ... designed to enhance the glory of a particular patron'), which, as it stands, is not only untenable and/or vacuous, but critically disabling; the commentary proper, however, is largely Bundy-free. In sum, Maehler's work does not answer, not even raise, all the significant questions about its subject, but serious students of choral lyric will find it of very great value indeed. David Bain's B**Masters, Servants and Orders in Greek Tragedy8 is not (as the uninitiated might assume) about class structures, but about a 'rule' of Greek tragic dramaturgy, that when unnamed extras (attendants or children) are given orders on stage, they comply without delay. Bain discusses intelligently, and on the whole convincingly, a dozen or so passages (mostly Euripidean) in detail and various others more briefly. The passages dealt with are generally exceptions to the rule, apparent or real, and they include, most intriguingly, Antigone's long-suspected volte-face (Soph. Ant. 904ff.), for which, however, Bain provides an interesting defence (pp. 24ff.). It is a minor irritant that this worthwhile study is disfigured by the choice of an absurdly small lunate sigma for the Greek quotations, whose lay-out, also, often leaves something to be desired. Mary R. Lefkowitz, B** The Lives of the Greek Poets,9 is another book with a rather deceptive title. Its subject is not so much the actual lives of Greek writers, as the Lives written about them in later antiquity. Once (and often still) taken all too seriously, these Vitae, as Lefkowitz amply demonstrates, are not biographies in our sense, but essentially fictions, often based on readings, or misreadings, of the author's own works. Lefkowitz deals with the material author by author, from Hesiod and Homer to the Hellenistic poets, and then helpfully adds what seem to be the first English translations of the principal Vitae involved (those of the tragedians, Homer, Pindar, and Aristophanes). The result is a valuable collection of evidence, information, and ideas, whose importance is indicated by a remark on p. x: 'much</page><page sequence="3">BRIEF REVIEWS 89 has been made .... of Sophocles' piety, Euripides' perversity, Callimachus' resentment of Apollonius. If this book can establish that these stories can be disregarded as popular fiction, some literary history will need to be rewritten.' My only complaint is that the presentation of the material is insufficiently systematic. Some chapters (e.g. the one on Hesiod) preface discussion of the biographies with evidence about the actual lives, others (e.g. the one on Sophocles) concentrate on the suspect Vitae, without making entirely clear what, if anything, we can still believe about the poets themselves. Furthermore, very little space is given to any general discussion of the biographers' procedures, their sources, or their topoi. It would be pleasant to think that Professor Lefkowitz means to produce such a complementary study soon. D. A. Russell's BCriticism in Antiquity1? is an important contribution to a woefully underdeveloped subject. It begins with a lucid historical survey of developments in ancient criticism and literary theory from the beginnings to Proclus. Then comes discussion of seven separate topics: inspiration, the poet as teacher, mimesis, rhetoric, theories of style, literary classification, and literary history. Finally, there is a useful appendix of some (mostly recherche) critical texts in translation to supplement Russell and Winterbottom's admirable collection, Ancient Literary Criticism (1972). The arguments in the book are carefully con- sidered and quite a bit of the detail is new. If the quality of the discussion is somewhat uneven (strong on rhetoric and literary history, much less secure with style; thoughtful on Horace, per- functory on Philodemus), the book as a whole is wide-ranging, well-conceived, and invariably sensible. One thing is missing: the perspective provided by criticism and theory from modern Europe. For want of this (except in passing allusions), various of Russell's generalizations and evaluations lack depth and rigour. With Aristotle's aid, he apprehends that the relation between oratory and literature, rhetoric and literary theory, is problematic (pp. 12ff., 114, 155, 170), but not that the problem is, at bottom, the modern concept of 'literature' itself, recently scrutinized by Macherey and others. He commends the ancient doctrine of the 'virtues of style' (p. 135) without even a reference to the two hundred years' worth of alternative theories from Words- worth onwards. More generally, he repeatedly proclaims the inadequacies of ancient criticism (e.g. pp. 6, 98, 113, 147) with no suitable (sc. alternative) equipment to hand with which to define them. Despite its limitations, though, the solid merits of Russell's book are not in doubt. Of the available surveys of criticism and theory in the ancient world, it is surely much the best. D. L. Page, Further Greek Epigrams," completes the monumental work begun by Gow and Page's Hellenistic Epigrams and The Garland of Philip, by editing and discussing all known literary epigrams composed before A.D. 50 which lay outside the scope of those volumes. The typescript for the book, which Sir Denys Page left all but finished at his death in 1978, has been unobtrusively prepared for publication by R. D. Dawe and J. Diggle. The bulk of the collection involves Hellenistic and later verse, but a bonus is the two hundred pages devoted to epigrams by, or ascribed to, famous authors of the earlier age, from Archilochus to Aristotle and Erinna. Here, in particular, Page is concerned with problems of authorship, to which he brings the immense skill and learning familiar to all students of his work. The same readers will be equally familiar with Page's less impressive qualities as a litt&amp;rateur, not least his life- long attachment to unsupported and unexamined value-judgements - at any rate, his own. That unlovely consort of his great virtues is much in evidence in this book: an epigram is 'silly' or 'beautiful', a couplet 'mediocre' or 'distinguished', according to some private, probably sub- classical, calculus. Had Page understood half as much about literary judgements as he did about philological ones, it would be hard to imagine his superior as a literary scholar. As it is, we can still be grateful for what he was and the remarkable work he left behind. M. S. SILK NOTES 1. Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics. Cambridge U.P., 1982. Pp. ix + 161.

Clausen have assembled an impressive team. They have succeeded in making available a great deal of information to a wide public that will include the undergraduate, the sixth-former, and the non-specialist. Some of the essays contain ideas that are sufficiently novel and con- troversial to interest even the specialist: for example, those of A. S. Gratwick on Early Republic literature (which is perhaps the best part of the book), of E. J. Kenney on Books and Readers and on Ovid, of J. C. Bramble on the minor Augustan writers and on Lucan. Most contributions are, in their various ways, interesting and well-written without containing much that will be new to the specialist. Few are as dull and thin as the essays of R. M. Ogilvie on Caesar and Livy or of G. Luck on Elegy. Only the contributions of W. V. Clausen on Catullus and on Virgil's Eclogues seemed to me to be idiosyncratic to a fault and largely inadequate, though even they contain some good points. The essays are pitched at rather different levels and adopt a variety of approaches and, as a result, each must be taken on its own terms. Since it was 'left to each contributor to treat his author or topic as he saw fit', it is inevitable that each has envisaged a different level of readership and interpreted the term literary criticism in his own way, with some contributors putting the emphasis on evaluation and others on interpretation. Some problems also stem from the decision to hive off the discussion of biography, chronology, and attribution together with bibliography into an appendix. An author's entry in this appendix must be located through the index, for there is no cross-reference, the running headlines do not match, and the entries are not alphabetical. The bibliographies are selective (with a few curious omissions) up to 1975, but, unavoidably, patchy for more recent years. They will provide a useful starting point for advanced study but it is often difficult to believe that the critical essay and the bibliography can be intended for the same reader. The division between the essays and the appendix tends to emphasize the gap between literary criticism and scholarship in a way that is, at least, unfortunate. Also, interesting ideas which occur in the main text are not usually tied to a bibliographical reference and so cannot be pursued easily; some controversial statements in the main text are not signalled as such by any reference to the standard view; and the general impression is given that most things about Latin literature are cut and dried. They are not. Other problems arise from the quite understandable decision to share out the 'central' authors from Catullus to Juvenal among so many contributors. The promise in the 'blurb' that 'the literature is presented throughout in the context of the culture and the social and historical processes of which it is an integral part' is not kept. The relations between contemporary authors and the role of patrons and shared friends do not emerge clearly; very little attention is given to Greek writers who were part of the Roman literary scene; and the relationship of each work to its Greek and even more its Latin precursors is handled with varying degrees of attention. Finally, I must voice a more personal disappointment: while it is not reasonable to look to a work of this sort for a complete account of an author like Virgil, it does seem a pity that extant authors like Valerius Maximus, Celsus, or even Pliny the Elder have not been given more full treatments and that one cannot turn to this book for the fullest possible accounts of those writers who exist in fragments or even in name alone. In short, CHCL 2 contains much that is valuable and useful but it has not wholly overcome the problems or met satisfactorily the many different demands that will be made of it. Perhaps the problems really are insurmount- able and the demands too different. Jean Granarolo is well known to scholars for his work on Catullus. In BCatulle, ce vivant he has written an introduction for readers of Catullus who are not specialists. His aim is to present the more important findings of scholars and critics as well as the fruits of his own studies. He has been largely successful: the book is written clearly and simply and, in spite of what seems a pervasive sentimental enthusiasm, it is a scholarly and balanced account. There are chapters on biography; the history of the text; the contents, metres,</page><page sequence="5">BRIEF REVIEWS 91 and arrangement of the poems; on the unite psychologique et morale; on the critical stereotypes of Catullus; on Catullus and Alexandrianism and on his characteristic poetic techniques. His book will provide an excellent starting point for advanced study of Catullus and a convenient summary account of the main trends of Catullan scholarship on each of these topics. In B*Formular Language and Poetic Design in the Aeneid Walter Moskalew presents a careful and thorough study of the verbal repetitions in the poem which is intended to challenge many of the standard views which have been taken from the earlier work of John Sparrow and others. The usefulness of his book is greatly enhanced by the sixty-two pages which list all the various repetitions. Moskalew believes that the repetitions are deliberate even when they are subconscious and that they should not be considered stylistic flaws that the poet would have removed in the course of a final revision. He establishes his case by comparing Virgil's own practice in the Eclogues and Georgics and the practice of Homer, Apollonius, and Lucretius and Ennius. He then goes on to discuss the various functions and effects of repetition, considering first those that help to fix a structural pattern or lend emphasis or just contribute to the making of an epic style and then those which help to create 'patterns of association'. He is usually cautious and circumspect in his discussion, aware of the limitations of statistical evidence, and alert to the potential multiplicity of effect and function which repetition can serve. It is inevitable that there is more disagreement when he uses verbal repetition as the basis for interpretation. But this is a useful, informative, and well-documented book that will be welcomed by fellow scholars and future commentators on the Aeneid. In B The Classical Priamelfrom Homer to Boethius William H. Race explains that the word priamel is simply a German 'translation' of praeambulum which originally denoted a minor genre of Medieval German poetry and only really entered classical studies earlier this century. He defines it as 'a poetic/rhetorical form which consists basically of two parts: "foil" and "climax". The function of the foil is to introduce and highlight the climatic term by enumerating or summarizing a number of "other" examples, subjects, times, places, or instances, which then yield (with varying degrees of contrast or analogy) to the particular point of interest or importance' (p. ix). The Latinist will think of the familiar examples in Horace Odes 1.1 and 1.7. The most useful part of this book is the index which collects references to hundreds of examples. The most interesting part is perhaps the introduction which traces the history of the term, tries to clarify the definition and establish criteria, and compares the priamel with other rhetorical figures. The main part of the text is, however, taken up with quoting and discussing, in broadly chronological sequence, some of the more interesting examples. Occasionally Race makes a good point, but in general his comments are jejune and unhelpful. Eclogue 6.62f. runs: tum Phaethontiades musco circumdat amarae/corticis atque solo proceras erigit alnos. The subject of both verbs is the singer, Silenus, and the lines are an example of the topos or convention according to which a poet can be spoken of actually doing that which he writes about. In Poeta Creator: Studien zu einer Figur der antiken Dichtung' Godo Lieberg has collected and discussed a large number of examples of this topos from authors as diverse as Euripides and Prudentius. His purpose, however, is not simply to trace the history of the poetic convention, but to argue that this topos is invested with deep philosophical and mystical significance. The collection of material is useful to have but the argument is not convincing. B**Livy, Rome and Italy (i.e. Books 6-10) completes the translation of Livy for Penguin Classics. There is a good brief introduction by R. M. Ogilvie and Betty Radice has translated the text with her customary accuracy and readability. The usefulness of the volume is enhanced by numerous, brief explanatory notes, four maps, and an index of proper names. It will be a useful addition to the libraries of the growing army of Latinless students of Roman history. R. G. Austin's edition of B**Aeneid 47 has now been reprinted in paperback, and this much admired commentary can continue to serve as an introduction to Virgilian scholarship for another generation of students. In view of the massive amount of work done on Virgil in recent years it has worn well, and the combination of detailed, scholarly comment on language, style, metre, and interpretation with warm, personal appreciation is still striking. That is not to say that a new edition would not handle some things differently: the techniques of imitation; the manipulation of poetic and rhetorical conventions; the 'elegiac' features of the love-story; the Carthaginian dimension of Dido's character and Dido's role as a mythical analogue for Cleopatra. But it will do no harm if the student feels that he can dissent from, supplement, or even refine on a basically sound and reliable guide in at least a few places. W. S. Anderson's **Essays on Roman Satire8 is a collection of fifteen articles written on this topic over the last two and a half decades. Anderson has persistently argued that Roman Satire is 'artistically controlled and elaborated poetry' rather than 'a social document' or 'social protest', and that the poetic speaker is a persona</page><page sequence="6">92 BRIEF REVIEWS not necessarily to be identified completely with the poet. It is clearly not a fault that so much in the essays on Horace and Persius lacks the novelty and controversial bite that they had when they first appeared. That is the penalty for having been on the winning side. All the articles are readable and many deserve re-reading. But the most important essays are those on Juvenal - for example 'Studies in Book 1 of Juvenal', 'Anger in Juvenal and Senaca', and 'Juvenal and Quintilian'. A good book on Juvenal remains a desideratum, but Anderson's articles go a long way to providing a substitute, and together offer perhaps the best available critical introduction. Richard Jenkyns's Three Classical Poets' consists of three essays on Sappho, Catullus 64, and Juvenal. Jenkyns sets out to examine critically and to justify Sappho's claim to be a great poet; to highlight the truly poetic beauties of Catullus 64; and to show that Juvenal was a great poet. He advocates a flexible approach to poetry and believes that 'we should approach each poem on the poet's own terms'. But since he is concerned to evaluate, he is compelled to appeal to criteria and he seems to me over-confident that it is possible to establish criteria which are both meaningful and universally valid. The book is permeated by such assertions as (p. 105): 'This fusion of outward precision and inner fantasy is a mark of the truly poetic mind.' Leaving aside the problem of defining vague terms like 'precision', 'fantasy', and the opposition of 'outward' and 'inner', the phrase 'the truly poetic mind' raises more problems that it answers. Is there just one (the)? Is 'truly poetic' opposed to 'merely poetic'; 'non-poetic'; 'unpoetic' or what? Are we concerned with minds at all, or with poems? The heart of the book lies in the detailed, lingering descriptions of individual passages. Jenkyns's approach (he would deny the term method) is to insist that the reader pay attention to the words actually used, to their sounds and rhythms, and also that he should be ready to see the light and colours, smell and scents, feel the textures and sensations, and hear the sounds and so on. It is difficult to imagine anyone dissenting from this view. When Jenkyns is guiding us through a passage he can be very illuminating when he is both accurate in his description and pointing out something that has gone unnoticed. But he frequently provokes dissent or objections. An example (chosen at random but not untypical) is his discussion of Catullus 64.11-21 (pp. 104f.). Line 13 runs: tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda. Jenkyns comments: 'Catullus focuses on the way the water twists away from the oar and is turned into foam as it twists.' His emphatic word is 'twists' which is present tense and repeated and the vividness of which is enhanced by 'the way' and 'as'. Torta is a past passive participle; the main verb is incanuit-not mentioned by Jenkyns. 'The oar' paraphrases not the singular, concrete 'remus' but the more vague, collective noun remigio. Spumis is not dative of result with torta (turned into foam) but sociative-ablative with incanuit. Later in this passage the Nereids rise e gurgite cano (18). Jenkyns comments: 'The sea is hoary, aged, in contrast with those lovely youthful bodies over which our eyes have been invited to linger.' But canus does not as readily suggest old age in Latin as 'hoary' does in English. And when Jenkyns adds explicitly that Catullus does not say the bodies are youthful, 'the pressure of the poetry does it all', it is possible to see the dangers of his approach. There is no contrast of age and youth in Catullus. Just an image of wet, female nakedness, which seems to me sensuous enough. The contrast in this passage is between mortals and ageless immortals, not between the old sea and young Nymphs. The accumulative effect of such imprecise description is distortion. In spite of these reservations, the reader who is prepared to argue and be on his guard may enjoy this urbanely written book. The essay on Sappho is perhaps the most successful, though the view of her poetry is one dimensional. The early part of Catullus 64 responds well to Jenkyns's approach, the later part does not. That is not a reason to feel Catullus has lost his grip, rather to feel that the approach is here inadequate. The essay on Juvenal is not a success. There are good observations on some passages where Jenkyns finds the poetic qualities he likes. But the function of these passages is not taken into account, no single poem is subjected to full, continuous analysis, and the result is a Juvenal who is praised for the wrong qualities. Of course, I agree that all the poetry Jenkyns discusses is great poetry. Those who say otherwise have never troubled me: for I would simply reply that any definition of poetry that excluded them was manifestly inadequate. IAN DU QUESNAY NOTES 1. Cambridge U.P., 1982.

In 1925 CAH Vol. III covered in one large volume Assyrians, Hittites, Urartians, Scythians, Babylonians, Israelites, and Greeks from the tenth to the beginning of the sixth centuries. The replacement will have three parts, but only the first and third have just appeared. One reason for the inflation over fifty years is the inclusion in Part 1 of over 200 pages on the prehistory of the Balkan regions, which it was not practicable to include in Vol. II; these accounts by the appropriate authorities of Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania concentrate pretty solidly on descriptions of huts, pots, axes, and so on, though one does note the prevalence (pp. 136, 208, 234) of the assumption that economic organization and the number of female figurines alike afford sure proof of matriarchy. But the primary justifica- tion for growth is the accumulation of archaeological and epigraphic material, and these volumes are likely to be especially valued for their full surveys of current states of play. The main bulk of Part 1 consists of treatment of the various Middle Eastern states at the times of Assyrian domination (though the full treatment of Assyrian culture and social structures are to come in Part 2), and ends with more on the Balkans, Geometric Greece (divided between Hammond, Snodgrass, Cook, and Boardman), and finally the development of alphabets and languages in the Balkans and Greece (Isserlin, Jeffery, Crossland, Hainsworth, and Polome). Part 3 concentrates on Greece between c. 750 and 530/500, and has chapters on contacts with the East (Braun), Cyprus (Karageorghis, Mitford, and Masson), colonization (Graham), developments in a number of different regions (Graham, Cook, Boardman, Willetts, Forrest, Hammond, and Andrewes), and ends with general chapters on economic and social conditions (Starr) and material culture (Boardman). As one would expect with such contributors (to restrict myself to the Greek sections), the chapters are full and authoritative (if variously readable); sources are quoted and cited more frequently than in the previous edition; and the bibliographies, collected at the end, are huge and have been brought up-to-date. Rather than offer praise (or blame) to individual contributors, two comments may be made on the consequences of the ever more extensive division of topics and regions among specialists. First, contributors often disagree with each other, or adopt differing lines, without necessarily acknowledging this or fully arguing for their positions; contrast, for example, on the eighth-century rise in population, Snodgrass (1.687), Graham (3.157), and Andrewes (3.380), with Starr (3.420), or on Delphi and colonization, Graham (3.145) with Forrest (3.307ff.), or on Athenian aims in Sigeum and the Chersonese Graham (3.121) with Andrewes (3.374, 405). Hammond's views, surely more heterodox than his text reveals, on matters such as the date and import of the rhetra and the reforms in early Sparta (1.735ff., 3.326ff.) are presumably not shared by many of his colleagues. Secondly, some major themes, broad lines of development, and issues of serious debate tend rather to get hidden under the mass of regional details (e.g. literacy), or handled partially by contributors of rather different views (e.g. tyranny). And it does not help that there is almost nothing in these volumes on religion, thought, or literature, though it is good to read that some attempt will be made to repair this in the next volume. But it is not easy to organize major co-operative undertakings of this type, and we should warmly welcome this progress. A large-scale individual project also makes progress, B*The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition2 is the third in Donald Kagan's projected four-volume history of the Peloponnesian War. While not the most radical or elegant of recent contributions to the subject, it is, like its predecessors, a well-argued, serious, and intelligent study of the main military, diplomatic, and political issues, which will properly be an up-to-date and reasoned supplement to students' reading of Thucydides, and will also offer some new ideas and arguments for the consideration of scholars and teachers; good examples are the treatment of</page><page sequence="8">94 BRIEF REVIEWS Alcibiades' machinations in the assembly in 420 and his strategies in the northern Peloponnese in 419. Kagan continues to hold very closely to Thucydides' annalistic organization and selection of events (one apparent consequence is the total silence in Kagan as well as in Thucydides 6 and 7 on Athens/Persia relations, and in particular on the date of Athens' alliance with the revolting Amorges). All Thucydidean speeches, including even the Melian Debate, are still considered authentic in essentials, and while Kagan is aware that Thucydides uses speeches and narrative for many complex purposes at a number of levels, he avoids as far as he can discussion of most of these, or of 'compositional' problems in the history; interesting as his conclusions on Thucydides' views on the Sicilian Expedition are, particularly the suggestion that the historian may have overreacted slightly against an Athenian tendency to treat Nicias as the scapegoat for the failure, further discussion of the development of Thucydides' views on the Expedition and on Athenian politics in general might help his case, and make clearer and more convincing the extent of his agreement and disagreement with Thucydides on these issues (perhaps the treat- ment of these topics in HCT Vol. V will have some effect on Kagan's final volume). Like the Sicilian Expedition, Athens' relations with her subject allies present a complex of issues on which Thucydides' narrative is arguably at odds with his analysis, on which he quite probably never finally made up his mind, and on which modern scholars are unlikely ever to agree, affected as they too are by diverse political beliefs. Some parts of this complex are attacked anew in a monograph by T. J. Quinn (who has made a number of article-length forays already). His BAthens and Samos, Lesbos and Chios: 478-404 B.C.3 runs through much of the evidence (though not all: in particular some tricky inscriptions are not very fully reconsidered) and tackles some unsolved (and probably unsolvable) problems; the general line is that the Athens tried increasingly to pursue a practical and flexible policy towards these islands, to persuade them (especially after 440) that they were particularly honoured (though perhaps without much success), and above all did not try to impose democratic governments, even after the Samian revolt of 440 or the Mytilenean in 427. Details will continue to be disputed, and Quinn's arguments will receive attention; but here too perhaps some attempt to place these issues in the broader contexts of the nature of political conflicts in the Aegean, the varieties of political systems and practices available, and the pressures applied by the powerful states, would give these studies more cogency and value. A much more substantial work, suitably enough, is devoted to a fourth-century figure of grandiose self-importance and considerable historical significance. Simon Hornblower's B**Mausolus4 surveys scrupulously, exhaustively, and intelligently all the literary, epigraphic, and archaeological evidence for fourth-century Caria and its relations with Persians, Greeks, and even Egyptians, for the Hecatomnid dynasty, and for Mausolus him- self and his works, and argues successfully for his importance in a number of areas. Mausolus did his best to interfere for his own ends in Aegean politics, and Hornblower's treatment of the decline of the Athenian Second Confederacy seems sounder than that recently offered by Cargill (cf. G&amp;R 29 (1982), 203); notably, Hornblower agrees with Cargill in attributing to Mausolus a large share of responsibility for fomenting the revolts of 357, and hence, as he points out, for hastening, in advance of the Macedonian monarchs, the destruction of Greek democracy and the renewed 'respectability' of monarchy. In this and other respects, Mausolus acted as a somewhat unusual 'satrap' of Persia, and Hornblower's attempt rather to play down the aberrancy of the Hecatomnids' position as Persian underlings is perhaps the least convincing part of the book, though it enables him to give a highly valuable account of what is known of the organization of the western parts of that ramshackle empire. But most attention is devoted to Mausolus as a precursor of the post-Alexander monarchs, as a Hellenizer, operating through synoikisms, building programmes, patronage, and so on to introduce an eclectic, at times perhaps distorted, Greek culture; and if the evidence - even for the Mausoleum itself - is too often inadequate for firm conclusions on dates and intentions to be drawn, Hornblower consistently asks the right questions, pursues them with relentless vigour, and is not afraid of bold speculations. Three, very different, books on Greek historians. The one that will be read most widely, and with most enjoyment, is John Hart's B*Herodotus and Greek History,5 a very welcome general introduction to the parts of Herodotus most studied in schools and universities by a schoolteacher primarily concerned to stimulate and enlighten those students. Successive chapters consider Herodotus' treatment of the most famous Athenian families, the Alcmaeonidae and Philaidae, perhaps as a convenient personalized means of discussing much of Herodotus' work on sixth- and early fifth-century Greek topics and sorting out the chronology (least convincing I found his idea that Herodotus is expressing his cynicism over Cleisthenes'</page><page sequence="9">BRIEF REVIEWS 95 motives by his flippant and inadequate handling of his reforms); second, the historian's religious beliefs and use of oracles, mostly sensibly, and with an appendix on Fontenrose's excessively sceptical attitude to Delphic oracles (though I would disagree with most of what he says about hubris and related themes); then two central and very useful chapters on politics, political systems, and political manoeuvres (emphasizing the flexibility of the historian's attitudes), and on war (with much good sense on the causes and conduct of the Ionian revolt and the Persian wars); a chapter on 'some personalities' (in fact Darius, Cleomenes, Demaratus, Themistocles, and Pausanias), and a final one on 'Herodotus - The Man in his Time', which both, at the cost of some recapitulation, helpfully discuss a good many interesting incidents and issues. One could find much else to criticize in detail (surely Herodotus did not suffer personally from Pericles' citizenship law, unless he hoped for Athenian sons-in-law?), and both the style and the thought are not infrequently a little loose; but it is good to see lively ideas, mostly based on sound recent scholarship, efficiently presented, and with enthusiasm for the book's remarkable subject. A paperback version would be even more useful. Totally different in style and aims from Hart, and with an approach to ancient historians far removed from those of Hart and Kagan, is Virginia Hunter's BPast and Process in Herodotus and Thucydides.6 In this work, which in part takes further ideas contained in her Thucydides the Artful Reporter (cf. G&amp;R 22 (1975), 9 If.), one is first struck by how little, in a book of this size, of the texts of the historians are actually analysed in detail; major claims of how the histories should be understood (e.g. p. 163, 'Process is the key to Thucydides' history') are extracted from discussions of Herodotus on Egypt, on Cambyses in Ethiopia, and on Darius in Scythia, and of Thucydides on early history and on Brasidas in Thrace. But in fact Hunter's interest - and in her view the historians' prime interests - lies rather in the 'patterns of generalizations' underlying the events than in the events themselves, in 'stages in recurrent and inexorable processes' rather than in individual events and their causes; it is these processes, these explanatory patterns, she argues, that the historians thought gave 'sense' to their narratives and which for us explain their selection and treatment of events and their development of key issues in speeches. There are, of course, genuine, and tricky, questions here, and Hunter has some valuable contributions to make. But the main difficulty with the book is that so often, after lengthy and repetitive discussions, conducted in an irritatingly pretentious tone, the patterns in the processes turn out to be disappointingly banal and familiar - chains of revenge, or pleonexia, and a drive for empire leading to a dangerous expedition, leading to disaster, or disintegration of empire and civilization - and because, perhaps, of the excessively general level at which she operates, the themes appear identical in both historians. But one may doubt, for example, whether the solutions to such long-standing Thucydidean problems as the causes of the war, the popularity of the empire, and of the historian's own political views, really lie (pp. 159f.) in being directed to 'a process of disunity and disintegration', or to 'the natural propensity of free men to reject arche .... and to strive .... for autonomy', or to Thucydides' awareness of barbarities on both sides and the destructive force of human nature. Jane Hornblower's book appeared almost simultaneously with her husband's, and her subject, B**Hieronymus of Cardia,7 like Mausolus of Caria, was a figure on the fringes of the Greek world whose career and memorials need - and receive - delicate scholarly skills to elucidate. Like other ancient historians, an exile and a soldier and politician, Hieronymus wrote the standard history of his various masters (his fellow-Cardian Eumenes, Antigonos Monophthalmus, Demetrius, and Antigonus Gonatas) and the other successors of Alexander, which, though on Dionysius of Halicarnassus' list of books which no one could read through to the end, was used by Plutarch, Nepos, and Arrian, and above all was the major source of Diodorus' 18-20, and the reason why Diodorus is so much fuller and more sensible in this part of his work. Almost no fragments survive (they are reprinted and commented on in Appendix I), and so the reconstruction of the scope, tone, and political and historiographical attitudes of the lost work which Hornblower undertakes is in large part a study of Diodorus, and throws much light too on his methods and style. From this extensive, cautious, and generally convincing investigation Hieronymus emerges with most of his credit intact, as a historian with a Thucydidean concern for an accurate, secular narrative of political and military events both contemporary and important (though, necessarily, with a greater concentration on the colossal individual figures), but one too who might show a Herodotean interest in the customs of an outlandish, freedom-loving people (the Nabataeans), and who may well have fore- shadowed Polybius in ending his work with the tears of the victor (Antigonus Gonatas over Pyrrhus at Argos, Plut. Pyrrhus 34), and Tacitus in his interest in the issue of the limited</page><page sequence="10">96 BRIEF REVIEWS liberty possible under a monarchy. But, even in Hornblower's sympathetic restoration, he was not free from serious bias, above all in favour of his first master Eumenes, on whose career Diodorus is particularly vivid, full, and unconvincingly eulogistic. Detailed, and at times necessarily heavy-going (doubtless like Hieronymus himself), this book is an important con- tribution to Hellenistic history and to the history of Greek historiography. Finally, the very welcome return to regular production of the **Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum8 continues. In this latest volume H. W. Pleket and R. S. Stroud give us predominantly 1978's crop of new texts and new work on old texts, with some more recent follow-up contributions, and some catching-up operations from 1976 on; as before, the skill and chalcenteric labours of the editors excite our admiration and gratitude.

Roman History A new reviewer is entitled to make a meal of his first contribution. The menu is substantial and varied, with only occasional helpings of stodge. First some homely fare. With *Rome against Caratacus' Dr Graham Webster has completed a valuable trilogy about the early years of the conquest of Britain (the other works are The Roman Invasion of Britain and Boudica: the British Revolt against Rome A.D. 60). The new volume covers the years of the push through the West Midlands and into Wales against Caratacus. It deals rather more briefly with the work of consolidation in the 50s by Scapula's successors. P. Ostorius Scapula died a frustrated and broken man. Webster is sceptical about his generalship: 'All through his period of office in Britain Scapula had made hasty decisions without full consideration of the long-term con- sequences.' This seems rather harsh; other assessments are possible: 'a skilful general with a fine grasp of strategic and tactical possibilities' (Frere). Webster has evolved an interesting format for his books. First comes a judicious narrative based on the ancient literary sources (a trans- lation of Tacitus Annals 12.31ff. is included in an appendix), in which Webster's determina- tion to extract as much information as possible from the text is only occasionally marred by strained and oversubtle interpretations of Tacitus' words. The historical narrative is followed by an attempt to dig up from a multitude of excavation reports and aerial photographs any information which may illuminate or supplement the account. Potentially it is a frustrating task, because he had to deal with the earliest levels on most sites. Much has to be left to conjecture. Webster is never afraid of conjecture. From an accumulation of scraps of evidence he produces a convincing picture of the Scapulan frontier system. Readers unfamiliar with the Welsh Borders may find themselves having to refer constantly to the maps. With appendices on the Roman army and other matters and with glossaries on Latin military terms this is a very useful book. The whole trilogy is a vivid testament to the ways in which archaeology in the hands</page><page sequence="11">BRIEF REVIEWS 97 of an acute scholar can enrich history. Webster notes that Tacitus' account of the crucial battle with Caratacus is very unsatisfactory and the site difficult to locate. It could hardly be otherwise. It may be doubted that Tacitus had either the information or the desire to offer a more accurate narrative. His 'sheer mountains' and 'towering heights' owe more to the con- ventions of rhetoric and, perhaps, to the Italian landscape than to any eyewitness description of the Welsh hills. So it is very refreshing to find that Lawrence Keppie, in his search for an even more famous British battle site, admits that Mons Graupius could be almost any hill in Scotland. His paper, in which he casts a sceptical eye over two hundred years of speculation, is one of a number presented to the twelfth meeting of the Scottish Archaeological Forum in 1980 to mark the 1900th anniversary of the first Roman penetration of Scotland and now published as *Agricola's Campaigns in Scotland.2 Brian Dobson offers a cool account of Agricola's life and career. He is rightly unimpressed by Tacitus' indignation on behalf of his father-in-law and is not deceived by the biographer's cliches. Indeed, it is the mark of all the contributions to this gathering to seek to penetrate beyond the rhetorical conventions of Tacitus' biography. David Breeze, for example, shows that, despite some claims to the con- trary, Agricola's eye for the country and his choice of camp sites (Agricola 20 and 22) were unexceptional. He does not seem to have been an innovator or even a good strategist. With papers on the Forth-Clyde frontier, the fort at Camelon, temporary camps, a reassessment of the Flavian frontier, and speculation about the availability of building timber, this must have been a stimulating gathering. At a comparatively modest price this well-produced volume deserves the attention of everyone interested in Agricola. On his death in 1977, Dr John Morris left a substantial manuscript about Roman London, apparently complete except for the notes. It now appears as BLondinium: London in the Roman Empire.3 It has been edited, annotated, and equipped with a bibliography. The decision to leave the text much as Morris wrote it is surely correct, because he had the amiable knack of being able to unravel complex arguments for a wide, non-specialist readership. Unfortunately the advances in our knowledge of Roman London have been so great in the past few years that a number of his conjectures have subsequently been proved wrong. They remain in the text, but are corrected in the notes - a not entirely happy solution. The sub-title is the key to Morris's intentions. To combat the insularity of many British archaeologists he seeks to set London in the general context of Roman provincial administration and urbanization in the West. Morris had wide interests which should have equipped him well to achieve his wholly laudable aim. Unfortunately he does not entirely succeed. An introductory chapter begins for some perplexing reason with democratic Athens and proceeds to offer an old-fashioned and inaccurate account of the rise of Rome, which is bespattered with wrong dates and horrors, such as 'democrats' in Rome. All to no purpose, since it is mainly irrelevant. Even when the book settles down to intertwining a straightforward account of the conquest of Britain with a narrative of political developments in Rome, neither element illuminates the other. The second half of the book is of more interest. Morris attempts to bring the remains of Roman London to life by drawing on comparative material which ranges widely in date and place. It is difficult to recommend this book as an account of Roman urbanization in the provinces and as a description of Roman London it is impossible to prefer it to Peter Marsden's Roman London which is up-to-date, concise, and better illus- trated. Now for the continental dishes. One of the finest achievements of Italian archaeology and history has been to reveal the rich diversity of life and culture in pre-Roman and early Roman Italy. Contemplation of this shows just what a remarkable achievement the 'tota Italia' of Augustus was. The literature in Italian on this subject is vast and ever- increasing. Until now there has been no convenient introduction in English. Here it is: *The Making of Roman Italy.4 E. T. Salmon has already illustrated sympathetically in Samnium and the Samnites the vigour of a non-Roman people and the far-from-benign impact of Rome. This new account of Italy from the Latin War to Augustus is straightforward, yet full of acute perceptions. Salmon rightly emphasizes the ways in which the invasion of Hannibal, so far from destroying the hold of Rome on her allies was a crucial factor in strengthening Roman predominance. The part played by colonies and roads in opening up the peninsula to Roman influence is properly stressed. On the other hand the impact on local cults and religion gets less than its due. Salmon can be forgiven for passing briefly over the complex causes of the Social War, a topic of which he must have grown tired. On the other hand he is excellent on the consequences of the war. This book opens up to an English audience the new dimension which has been added to the history of Italy in the past thirty years. Philippe Moreau's</page><page sequence="12">98 BRIEF REVIEWS **Clodiana Religio5 bears the imprint of its origin as a doctoral thesis. It is a careful study of the Bona Dea scandal which concentrates on the technicalities of the legal processes by which Clodius was brought to trial. The case was without precedent (Cicero Har. Resp. 12) and the senate decided that the most appropriate procedure was that for incestus. Moreau's step-by-step explanation is clear and sensible. His conclusions are undramatic; but on the way he sharpens the details with effect. Occasionally his assessments are odd. He is wrong to suggest that there was no declared inimicitia between Cicero and Clodius after the trial (Cicero, ad Art. 2.1.5 certainly does not support him). There is no reason to suppose that Roman society was not genuinely shocked by the scandal. Cicero ad Art. 1.12.3: '... rem esse insigni infamia. quod te moleste ferre certo scio' is not ironic. On the general political situation Moreau is less good. His Republic is still haunted by those perennial ghosts, the optimates and the populares. The emperor Nerva once claimed that he had interrupted his quies to take on the principate 'in order that I might confer new beneficia and preserve those already granted by my pre- decessors'. Yet many historians have sought to diminish the importance in the Empire of the kind of personal patronage which is taken to be one of the keys to the politics of the Republic. Now Richard P. Saller's B**Personal Patronage under the Early Empire6 asserts powerfully that at all levels patronage continued to be significant. The commendationes to be found in the correspondence of Pliny or of Fronto differ little from those of Cicero. They suggest that 'the exchange of economic and social goods and services within the imperial aristocracy con- tinued largely unchanged from the end of the Republic'. In his survey of the many aspects of the emperor as 'super-patron' Saller acknowledges a debt to Fergus Millar's The Emperor in the Roman World. But his particular concern is with those personal acts of patronage which aimed to boost the prospects of men who had access to public office. It has been the trend of scholars, such as Birley and Pflaum, to assume that senatorial and equestrian careers became highly regular and conventional by the second century. The emperor is seen as an administrator confirming appointments which were awarded on the basis of seniority and/or merit; the emperor's discretion was thus limited and the frequent references to his beneficium in such cases were purely conventional. The core of Saller's book is designed to refute this thesis. While regularities in the pattern of careers can be observed, they are far less structured and rigid than has been supposed. There was plenty of room for the exercise of patronage - and not just by the Emperor. Sailer highlights the important role of the amici Caesaris as 'brokers' in the granting of favour. In the provinces as well governors and officials could be vital in the intro- duction of provincials to public life at Rome. Sailer illustrates this by a case study of North Africa, an obvious choice, of which there have been a number of other studies. It would be of great interest to look at the evidence from other regions. The book is prefaced with a dis- cussion of the language of patronage. In many ways this section is Hellegouarc'h with additions. This adds weight to Saller's general argument. The words of patronage continue in the early Principate to have the same connotations as Hellegouarc'h discerned for the late Republic. In this very useful study Saller is provocative in argument and balanced in judge- ment. A particularly important aspect of patronage was the relation between the freedman and his ex-master. G. Fabr&amp;'s **Libertus,7 a study devoted to the last two centuries B.C., seeks to suggest that earlier works, such as Treggiari's Roman Freedmen in the Late Republic, have tended to underemphasize the nature of the bonds between patron and freedman. Fabre argues that as Roman law developed so the position of the freedman became more sharply defined. If this was sometimes to the freedman's benefit, in that the patron's powers were limited, in many other ways the law sought to re-emphasize the freedman's inescapable obligations to his ex-master. Fabre tends to trust too much to the assumption that the law reflects the realities of life. If he protests too readily the originality of his work there is still much here to provoke thought. If I had my pick of the dishes, I would settle for Timothy D. Barnes's B**Constantine and Eusebius.8 Despite the recent appearance of other studies of Constantine, this 'interpretative essay', as the author dubs it, is the best account available of the first Christian emperor. I say this even though Barnes's view of Constantine is very different from my own. I have always seen Constantine as a hick whose ill-informed and simplistic beliefs made him susceptible to manipulation by subtler Christian minds. The real victor at the Milvian Bridge was Bishop Ossius. However, for Barnes the apparent ambiguities of Constantine's re- ligious attitudes are to be explained not by any doubt or hesitation in his own mind, but as the actions of a shrewd and skilful statesman who realized that he had to play to two audiences, one Christian, one pagan. This is argued with the power and the sharp eye for detail which is the</page><page sequence="13">BRIEF REVIEWS 99 hallmark of Barnes's scholarship. Yet all this is just a preliminary establishing of a context for the consideration of Eusebius. Although during the period in which Barnes was writing R. M. Grant has produced his Eusebius as Church Historian, Barnes is right to say that Eusebius remains strangely neglected. As he demonstrates, his importance lies not just in his role as a historian of the church but also as a contemporary observer of a crucial period. Each of Eusebius' works is placed carefully in context. Barnes has a higher regard for Eusebius as a biblical scholar than many other commentators. On the other hand it is shrewd to strike a note of caution about the Life of Constantine. The air of intimacy which that work exudes may be misleading, given that Eusebius met the Emperor perhaps on no more than four occasions. This book is enviable in its scope, admirable in its scholarship, and magisterial in its judgements. The interesting theme of Yves Albert Dauge's BLe Barbare9 is that if there had been no barbarians, the Romans would have had to invent them. It is difficult to believe that any study of a subject which is over 350 pages in length could be described as cursory. Yet this is what part one of Dauge's book undoubtedly is. It is a plod, author by author, era by era, through references to barbarians in Roman literature, which is neither exhaustive nor perceptive. Realizing that this does not get us far, Dauge tries again in another 300 pages on 'structural barbarology'. The mildly interesting part of this is a discussion of 'barbarus' and associated words. On the other hand I found the chapters on 'the Bipolar Structure of Reality' particularly unenlightening. More is to come: another 150 pages on 'functional barbarology' and a footnote which warns of the impending publication of another book by the same author on the subject. The author's energy is admirable; the subject is a good one; his assumptions are questionable; his approach perverse; his arguments opaque; his judge- ment lacking; the result indigestible. Finally for a tasty snack. Generations of students, struggling with essays on the Gracchi, Jugurtha, or Marius, have had 'Greenidge and Clay' as their constant companion. Now D. L. Stockton has produced *From the Gracchi to Sulla"o in which the sources appear in translation. The basic format of 'Greenidge and Clay' has been followed; sources are cited under consular years and grouped by subject matter within each year. Stockton's selection of passages is somewhat different and he links material with brief, explanatory comments. Historians with a high-minded integrity may object to this as to all source books. It is impossible to assess the validity of passages torn from their immediate context. A single sentence of the Epitome of Livy may give undue pause for thought to the student who is unaware of the nature of the farrago from which it is taken. On the other hand the average school library does not have Florus, Justin, and Valerius Maximus. Stockton does try to counter some of the criticism by citing passages in extenso where possible. As with 'Greenidge and Clay' the emphasis is on political and military matters. I missed the elogium of Marius. It is a pity not to cite at least some of the Naples Tablet. The translations are Stockton's own. This Lactor in its bright new format, well-produced, yet still sold at a low price, is bound to be a winner. JEREMY J. PATERSON NOTES 1.

Archaeology and Art The need to keep a check on new finds in archaeology is an ever present chore, and thus synthesizers are angels of mercy. Richard Hope Simpson has spent over twenty-five years working at field archaeology in different parts of Greece and in 1965 produced a most useful gazetteer and atlas of Mycenaean sites. The present volume, BMycenaean Greece, ' is 'a revision' and 'a replacement' for the earlier book which is now out of print. It is well organized by areas, and each area is prefaced by a detailed map giving the distribution of the known sites. The author draws on his own extensive researches and integrates with them the results of field-work carried out by fellow archaeologists. The fact that we are presented with an overall view of Mycenaean Greece makes the compilation particularly worthwhile and enables students to in- vestigate such questions as the extent of that culture - to use a recent phrase, where was its 'northern frontier'? what was the nature of the settlements in Asia Minor? - and also to tackle such problems as the existence of single control over a wide area and geographical determinism in the location of sites. Hope Simpson is alive to the drawbacks of his work, such as the in- evitable reflection in the maps of the period of Myceaean koine (LH IIIA2-B), but defends his specific approach against the theorists and trigger-happy statisticians. His minatory attitude to speculation is perhaps a shade overdone; like the lady, he doth protest too much. It has been mainly students of the prehistoric period in Greece like Hope Simpson who have pulled on their walking boots and carried out site-surveys in the field. For later periods the existence of other types of evidence has tended to divert the student's attention from such an approach. The appearance of BRoman Crete,2 a book that draws together all the archaeological threads that belong under that title and adds much new material, reveals how much emphasis has been placed on the Minoan period of the island and how little on later times. The organization of the book is not so rigid as Hope Simpson's, and the gazetteer section, which takes Pendle- bury's 1939 list as its basis and more than doubles it, occupies 40 pages towards the end. The book is prefaced with a short but detailed history of the island under Roman rule, using literary and documentary sources, and the following chapters that are grouped around subjects such as administration, economy, religion, architecture flesh out the skeleton of events. The early promise that shines through this work will now never be fulfilled, as Ian Sanders died of cancer whilst still in his twenties, and, as Peter Warren suggests in his foreword, 'the fittest memorial to this young scholar's work would be that others take up the challenge of the Roman Cretans'. Sad to say, the publishers have not served him well; in my copy four sheets are repeated and two pages are only half inked. It is no easy task to write an introductory book on Greek and Roman art, as the blurb says, 'for the student or general reader coming to the history of art for the first time', nor is it easy for a reviewer who has come to the history of art before to know whether such an aim has been successful. However, from my disadvantageous point of experience, Susan Woodford's B* The Art of Greece and Rome3 looks lively enough and refreshing enough to engage the interest of the eager hordes - indeed, if the novices are not caught by this particular projection of the subject, I suggest art history is not for them and that knitting or fly-fishing might be a better bet. Like Gaul, the book is divided into three parts: archaic and classical; fourth-century and Hellenistic; Roman; then within each part three more sections on sculpture, painting, and architecture. Not unusual, one might say, but the author has infused new blood into the old veins, has thought about the needs of the beginner, and has struck a balance between condescension and conceit. The choice and arrangement of the pictures serve the text perfectly, and her willingness to explain pictorially what is being expressed leads, with conscious humour, to a multicoloured New York kouros and a cartoon related to the discus-thrower. A must for the school library where it is likely to be a popular choice for borrowing. The selection of pictures in Woodford's book is necessarily traditional. "Greek and Roman Sculpture in America4 is a splendid picture book of some of the best in American public collections. Many of the well known pieces are included, but by no means all (no New York kouros here, no Boston throne); the compiler has preferred to include examples from less prestigious museums. The arrangement for the most part is in chronological blocks withth the copies inevitably set alongside works from the period of the original; some sections are devoted to geographical areas (Cyprus, Palmyra) or to sculptural types (funerary,</page><page sequence="15">BRIEF REVIEWS 101 portraits, sarcophagi). The whole book is extremely handsome, with a fine set of colour plates as an hors-d'oeuvre. Cornelius Vermeule in his two part introduction gives a brief history of classical sculpture followed by an account of American collectors and collections. Indeed, the book is as much an indication of taste and connoisseurship as of classical sculpture; the pages resound with colourful names from Luigi Palma di Cesnola, for thirty years director of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, to J. Paul Getty, 'the titan of our age', and his remarkable museum at Malibu, where a fragmentary archaic Attic grave relief and the now famous Getty bronze are alone worth the trip. The Greek VaseS is an odd collection of papers, seven in all, which were delivered at a symposium held at Troy (New York, not Phrygia). J. V. Noble's contribution on the making of the Greek vase is, it is admitted, substantially his 1968 article from The Muses at Work, and there is no indication of any further thoughts or re- actions to more recent theories (e.g. Seiterle on the relief line). H. F. Gaugh's treatment of Dionysos in Greek vase-painting is heavily, indeed almost totally, dependent on the illus- trations contained in Arias-Hirmer-Shefton, and is not helped by references to the recent film 'The Deer Hunter' nor by the inclusion of a Lichtenstein canvas and a black-and-white reproduc- tion of'a rich, pleasurable, green painting' by Barnett Newman entitled 'Dionysius' (sic.). T. S. W. Lewis compares Homeric epic and Greek Geometric vases (again?). He tells us that left branching swastikas are 'Helios setting, dying into rebirth' and that 'urn and epic are anthropomorphic' because both have off-centre bellies. The redeeming piece is Dietrich von Bothmer's excellent discussion of the iconography of the death of Sarpedon. He too compares literature and art, and he sees an identity of approach by Homer and Euphronios in their sympathy with victors and vanquished alike. Now that's more like it. 'The last decades of this century may yet prove to be an age of progress in Macedonian studies.' This sentence by Eugene Borza was originally written in the summer of 1977, prophetically heralding the great archaeological finds at Vergina and signalling half a decade of intensive publications in Macedonian research. The sentence is repeated in his introductory essay to Macedonia and Greece in Late Classical and Early Hellenistic Times6 which contains the contributions to a symposium held at the National Gallery of Art in Washington late in 1980, and a thoroughly admirable publication it is. The richness of the subject, historically and artistically, is clear for all to see: on the historical side, we have Badian on how the Greeks and Macedonians perceived each other, Bosworth on the Illyrian campaign of 335 B.C., Markle on Macedonian arms and tactics, etc.; and on the artistic side, Barr-Sharrar on metal vases, Stella Miller on the architecture and decoration of Macedonian tombs, and many more. Illustrations are plentiful and notes full. Borza in his wide-ranging first essay sketches the anomalous position the area has always had, both in antiquity and in more recent times when the mention of Macedonia was likely to be linked to the Macedonian Question. Let us hope that the optimism of 'an age of fulfillment in Macedonian studies' may be realized. Once again, the Macedonians are coming. A hundred years ago the Demeter sanctuary on the south slope of the Pergamon acropolis was located and in the following generation uncovered and studied. A further period of study was carried out in the 1960s and 1970s, and the results of Dr C. H. Bohtz's work at that time, **Das Demeter- Heiligtum,7 have been posthumously published. The traditional quality of the series is here main- tained, both in the content and in the presentation. The sanctuary lies to the west of the great gymnasium complex in the middle town, and an inscription indicates that the temple with its great altar was dedicated by Philetaerus and Eumenes for their mother Boa to Demeter. The long, narrow temenos contained an eastern half that was arranged in the manner of a telesterion with seats on one side facing an open rectangle. Use of the sanctuary continued well into the Roman period, and there was a late flowering under Antoninus Pius. The whole volume is a tribute to the skill and meticulous work of Dr Bohtz, both as an archaeologist and as a drafts- man. Drawn reconstructions together with photographs of the model made of the original Hellenistic version of the sanctuary bring the whole place to life. It is twenty years since the project for an international corpus of sculpture of the Roman world (CSIR) was started. The Romano-British section has now reached the second fascicule of the first volume. Slow progress, but not to be laid at the door of these authors who had completed their work some years ago. The present fascicule, **Bath and the Rest of Wessex,8 includes Avon, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, Sussex, and Wiltshire, and as the authors ingenuously point out, 'the region cannot claim to be rich in sculpture'. It is a case of Bath first, the rest nowhere, as out of the fewer than two hundred pieces, over eighty came from Bath. The brief introduction dis- cusses distribution, material, categories, and style, and considering the paucity of remains, it</page><page sequence="16">102 BRIEF REVIEWS is noteworthy that Bath has provided the names of a sculptor and a stonemason (though nothing of their work) and that the authors have been able to attribute three reliefs from different places to one man. Already new excavations in Bath are producing further sculptures which cannot fail to affect what is said here. So, it is a case of 'little and late', and very ex- pensive! A second catalogue of Romano-British material deals with wall-paintings, and here the picture is brighter in a number of ways. Norman Davey and Roger Ling's Wall-Painting in Roman Britain9 is a companion volume to D. S. Neal's Roman Mosaics in Britain, same size and format and with the useful coloured microfiches in a pocket at the back. Norman Davey has been responsible for most of the restoration work on the paintings, and a section of the introduction is devoted to an explanation of his method, together with a discussion of the technical aspects of painting and plastering. Ling sets the paintings in their art-historical context, and there is one section devoted to the way in which the artists worked and to the possibility of distinguishing schools, to which the answer is severely negative, a sad but explicable anti- thesis to the position with mosaics. The catalogue runs to fifty-three items, with an appendix of twelve items known only from old photographs and drawings - a generous haul, as the con- servation of wall-paintings really began only after the Second World War. This is a book that will prove indispensable to students of Roman Britain, of Roman wall-painting, and of the technical aspects of conservation. It would have seemed that Richard Payne Knight was to be forever known as the man who wrote a youthful discourse on the worship of Priapus (to fuel, it was alleged, 'the obscene revellings of Greek scholars in their private studies' - happy days!) and who in later life refused to recognize the quality of the Elgin marbles (sight unseen, he dubbed them 'of the time of Adrian'). Now Michael Clarke and Nicholas Penny in B** The Arrogant Connoisseur: Richard Payne Knight 1751-182410 have rehabilitated him, he is still arrogant but he was a connoisseur of distinction. The present volume was published to coincide with an exhibition on Knight held in Manchester in the spring of 1982, and the latter part of the book is a catalogue of the items on display, many of them works that Knight himself had collected. The first two thirds of the volume are taken up with a series of essays on his life, his collecting, and his ideas on architecture, art, and aesthetics. Alongside the ephemeral, not to say nonsensical, ideas that Knight joined in propagating, there were others that were out of their time then but are more in favour now, such as religious tolerance and his hatred of the Christian concept of eternal damnation. One chapter on collecting ancient art and one on collecting paintings and drawings reveal the strength of his reputation as a collector, somewhat removed from his public judgements. In an age when 'the successful impositions of picture dealers, the dupery of collectors and the quackery of both' were common, no one was likely to be faultless in his judgements. On one occasion Knight is reported to have attributed his error 'to a dark room and want of Spectacles'. 'So uncertain is Connoisseurship' was the tart comment. B. A. SPARKES NOTES 1.

Owen's untimely death is a deep grief to his friends, pupils, and colleagues, and an irreparable loss to the republic of letters. Language and Logos,1 written and received as a birthday present, will be read in sadness as a memorial volume. The contributions are all by dis- tinguished authors, and most are distinguished papers. Two are on the Presocratics (both, alas, on Heraclitus - hence nothing in the volume on the Eleatics in whose study Owen made signal advances); five of them are on Plato (2) of them on Cratylus - again, not the most obvious choice for the book). Then there are six pieces on aspects of Aristotle, and two - two of the best - on later Greek philosophy. The editors have added a bibliography of Owen's publications. This is a book worthy of its dedicatee. All students of ancient philosophy will buy it. I have six new books on the Presocratics, two of them devoted to Empedocles. M. R. Wright's BEmpedocles, the Extant Fragments2 is a full-scale edition of the surviving fragments: an Intro- duction gives a survey of the evidence for Empedocles' life, and a clear account of the main lines of his thought; a text of the fragments (but not of the testimonia), each displayed in its context, follows; then a commentary - philological, philosophical, and historical - accom- panied by an English translation of the Greek texts; finally a useful index verborum. The edition sports several novelties in matters of detail, and it carries at least one major claim to originality (concerning the nature and identity of Empedocles' 6a4L'ovEs); but on the whole - and especially when compared with recent continental scholarship - Mrs Wright is a model of orthodoxy and conservatism. Her book will be particularly helpful to students new to Empedocles who will find in it a sober guide through the jungle of Empedocles' thought and language. D. O'Brien's monograph B**Pour Interpreter Empedocle3 is a different type of production. Outraged by the methodological ineptitude of recent research on Empedocles, O'Briern 'has judged it useful to bring out the principles which ought ... to underlie the study of Empedocles'. He proceeds not by the explicit enunciation of abstract principles but by critical examination of the argu- ments of the Dutch scholar van der Ben. The criticisms are usually correct, and they are often expressed with an attractive brutality. But I confess that I did not discover from them any general principles of method - beyond the banal truths that it is a good idea to argue cogently and that it pays to read a work before discussing it. David Sider's BThe Fragments of Anaxagoras4 contains - like Wright's Empedocles - an introduction, text, translation, and running commentary; but its 'main purpose', its author says, is 'to present an improved text and apparatus for the direct quotations attributed to Anaxagoras'. Sider has made a fresh scrutiny of the manuscripts of Simplicius, the main source for the fragments; and his text is provided with a full app. crit. He differs from the standard text of Diels-Kranz in some 25 places. Most of the differences are, unsurprisingly, trivial; but more than one is substantial (note 7roAov for 7roAAov in B2, 70oj ~t for rT -q in B3, "Toy for 7rwv at the end of B12, o"aa aEr; r' TEKpa'T71a in B13). Many of those readings will be controversial; but whether or not Sider's text is right, he has at last laid a level floor on which the controversialists may dance. Even if all his textual in- novations are wrong (and probably most of them are), he has done scholarship a good service. The commentary contains a number of admirable notes (particularly good are the comments on explanatory 6;); but I found Sider's more general exegetical suggestions less than convincing. (Let me add a comment on the end of B12. Sider rejects Wasserstein's excision of oEdv;. Yet Anaxagoras' point must be, as Sider himself puts it, that 'whereas nous is pure and homo- geneous, nothing else is'. Now that reading requires the excision. Sider's text says that 'nothing can be exactly the same in composition as anything else'. But, pace Sider, it is one thing to say that all stuffs are impure, another to say that no stuff is like any other.) A second monograph by O'Brien is given to Democritus. This is the first of four projected studies entitled Theories of Weight in the Ancient World.' Did Democritus' atoms possess weight? That is the enticing and controversial issue which this huge volume tackles. O'Brien concludes</page><page sequence="18">104 BRIEF REVIEWS first, and with confidence, that the atoms do indeed have weight 'in proportion to and dependent upon their size'; secondly, and more tentatively, that 'the weight of atoms moving in the void was expressed by force of impact and by speed'. The conclusions result from an extraordinarily detailed and painstaking analysis of a number of passages in Aristotle and Simplicius. The book is no thriller. But anyone who is genuinely interested in the problem must tackle it in the way O'Brien does, however hard the slog. The Sophists (whom I here count among the Presocratics) have on the whole had a bad press - indeed, with Plato and Aristotle against them, they never had a chance. But champions have from time to time charged forth with sophistical favours up their sleeves (or wherever favours were kept), and the latest of that doughty breed of warriors is G. B. Kerferd. He is not particularly concerned, as George Grote was, with vindicating the moral character of his proteges; rather, he believes that the sophists were serious thinkers - men whose intellectual and philosophical importance matches that of an Anaxagoras or a Democritus. B*The Sophistic Movement6 argues the case well: the evidence is carefully marshalled, without misleading jargon or parti pris; and the deductions are lucidly drawn. Gorgias and his men are shown to have contributed to logic, to rhetoric, to epistemology, to linguistics - and above all to ethical and political theory, where their work on v4os and atLS, on the teachability of ~pETjr, on the nature and origins of civil society, and on political justice was of seminal importance. Kerferd (to change the metaphor) is counsel for the defence: it is not his task to tell the whole truth about the sophistic movement. (Thus we hear little about Gorgias the showman - the author of the Helen and On Nature or What Is Not, the star who came to Athens, booked the theatre, stood before the audience, and offered to make a speech on any subject they chose for him.) The Sophists were, I suspect, more complex - and more amusing - characters than the earnest scientists whom Kerferd partially presents. But Kerferd has indubitably told some interesting, undervalued, and creditable truths about his clients. I commend his lively book to anyone with an interest in the intellectual life of late fifth- century Greece. Kerferd's call for serious and detailed investigation of the Sophists' philosophical activities introduces The Sophists and their Legacy.' The first paper in the collection, by C. J. Classen, argues convincingly that Aristotle, despite his generally pejorative use of the term aof~otLKdS , 'treats the Sophists no better and no worse than any other earlier thinker or writer' - Aristotle, in short, shared Kerferd's view of the men. The volume contains several other interesting pieces: I enjoyed Furley's paper on Antiphon's notion of justice (which defends an interpretation first advanced by Kerferd), Verdenius on 'Gorgias' Doctrine of Deception' (yet I doubt if there is anything as formal as a 'doctrine' there), Saunders on Protagoras and punishment (despite the fact that Saunders praises as a 'brilliant insight' the pernicious view that punishment should be exclusively forward-looking). Saunders' paper, it might be added, is not really about the Sophists themselves - it is about Plato's Protagoras. Similarly, two other contributions to the volume - Sprague on Eating and Growing, Kahn on the Social Contract Theory - are not really given to the Sophists. No matter: this is a very serviceable collection of papers. (Marred, however, by appalling proof-reading and by the absence of any indexes.) It is pleasant to read praise of the Sophists - and equally pleasant to find Socrates cut down to size. Mario Montuori's *Socrates8 is an abridged version of an Italian study first published in 1974. Montuori aims to produce an historical understanding of Socrates the man. The sole surviving piece of historical evidence about Socrates, he claims, is the formal indictment preserved by Favorinus (apud Diogenes Laertius 2.40). Everything else is 'myth', deriving from the apologetic literature produced in answer to Polycrates' KaTqyopta. Even the celebrated oracle given by Delphi to Chaeremon has to be regarded as a genial in- vention by Plato. Montuori is surely right to stress that the various apologies for Socrates belong to a recognized rhetorical genre and were never intended to be read as factual chronicles. His sustained scepticism is an excellent corrective to the ingenuous applause of Socrates' modern philosophical fans. Those who persist in thinking that Plato gives us an accurate portrait of the historical Socrates will not relish this book; but I hope that they will read it. In a companion volume, BDe Socrate luste Damnato9 Montuori reprints four eighteenth- century essays on the 'Socratic problem'. These essays hardly add to our understanding of Socrates and his problems, but they are fascinating curiosities. On Plato, let me first mention a welcome addition to the vast literature on the Republic. Julia Annas's B*An Introduction to Plato's Republic"? is a philosophical commentary written for students who are reading the dialogue - or Plato - for the first time. The book manifests the modest virtues of clarity, sobriety, and thoroughness. But it does not display the dullness which so often accompanies those</page><page sequence="19">BRIEF REVIEWS 105 virtues: it is lively, exciting, challenging. Although Annas does not pursue novelty for its own sake (her general approach to the Republic is correctly conventional), she is happy to take issue with reigning platitudes when they are wrong. (Thus she briskly rejects the fashionable idea that 6LKaloanvrq in Plato means 'righteousness' or 'morality' rather than 'justice'.) She expounds Plato's arguments lucidly, and she also assesses them. Her assessments can be sharp - Book 10 is dismissed as a 'lame and messy ending' to the dialogue. But she loves Plato and she is in sympathy with many of his philosophical aspirations. She holds that the Republic chronicles a 'revolution in moral theory' - and she herself mans the barricades alongside the revolutionaries. In short, the book is sound and reliable, and at the same time vivacious and kicking. I recommend it without reservation. (Students will probably have to choose between Annas's Introduction and White's Companion (reviewed in this journal in 1980). They should opt for Annas.) The political theory of the Republic is modified and embellished in the Politicus and the Laws. Those three dialogues are the object of a new volume in the series Political Thinkers. Robert W. Hall's BPlato 1 is meant as an introductory exposition for students of political science. I did not find it a joy to read - Hall's prose strikes me as laboured and in- elegant. And the book contains a number of strange assertions - notably the claim that one of Plato's 'constant preoccupations' was the development of a society in which the great good of freedom might be attained. Nevertheless, the book will prove useful inasmuch as it deals with Plato's political thought as a whole and not just with the familiar segments of the Republic. Political science embraces the theory of punishment. Plato passes remarks on punishment in the Gorgias and the Protagoras as well as in the Republic and the Laws. Some scholars have found in those texts a theory of punishment which is both practicable and humane. In B*Plato on Punishment 12 Mary Margaret Mackenzie argues that Plato's theory fares better than any of its modern successors - but that it is nevertheless ultimately unacceptable. Her analyses of the relevant Platonic texts are lucid and helpful. But I am left wondering why anyone should speak of Plato's theory of punishment; for the texts do not present anything systematic enough to count as a theory, nor do they offer a unitary or coherent account of the practice of punishment. Mackenzie prefaces her discussion of Plato's views with, first, a somewhat slick critique of modern theories of punimhment, and secondly, a dubiously pertinent history of the birth and development of the idea of punishment in ancient Greece. I was sometimes puzzled and sometimes vexed by this book, but I was not bored. It is not an elementary introduction; but it could be read with profit and enjoyment by a beginner in this difficult subject. The Phaedrus is not, I am afraid, a dialogue which I find intellectually stimulating (its literary merits are another matter). But it was a central text for the Greek Neoplatonists, and later it excited their fifteenth-century followers in Italy. Michael J. B. Allen has produced an admirable edition of Ficino's treatment of the dialogue.13 The body of the book is a text, with facing translation, of Ficino's Latin introduction to the Phaedrus. Allen's prefatory matter gives fascinating information about the influence of Plato's charioteer. The edition is scholarly, clear, and prettily produced. Finally, a grotesque. Marcel Deschoux's Comprendre Platon14 is a bibliography, purportedly exhaustive, of writings on Plato in French from 1880 to 1980. (Foreigners get into this chauvinistic act if they have been translated into French or re- viewed by Frenchmen.) The enterprise is misbegotten, ill-executed, and (if nature does nothing in vain) an unnatural perversion of scholarship. I turn now from Plato to Aristotle. Professor W. K. C. Guthrie's monumental History of Greek Philosophy will rank as one of the glories of British scholarship. It is immensely learned, stuffed with sound judgement, and written in an easy elegance of style. Alas, the final volume on BAristotleI5 is a falling-off from the comprehensive excellences of its predecessors. Guthrie subtitles the volume 'an Encounter'. He confesses that the book 'is not an encyclopaedic "enquire within" for any information about Aristotle', and he explains - with evident surprise - that on rereading what he had written he found it 'intensely personal'. There is no reason why a history of philosophy - even a standard six volume history - should not be personal in tone, though Guthrie's readers will no doubt be as surprised as the author to find that characteristic in the volume on Aristotle. But encyclopaedic scope is just what readers of Guthrie's History have come to expect and what has made that History an invaluable companion for students of ancient philosophy. Guthrie half- excuses his partial treatment by reference to Duiring's magisterial Aristoteles. But although that great work has many merits, its existence does not render otiose an encyclopaedic treatment by another scholar in another language and tradition - and in fact Guthrie only half-believes his own half-excuse. Guthrie notes that he has been unable to give adequate attention to the</page><page sequence="20">106 BRIEF REVIEWS Politics and the Poetics. (The Poetics, one of Aristotle's most influential writings, is mentioned only twice, in footnotes.) He also observes, after a brief and informal review of Aristotle's logic, that he has nothing to say on Aristotle's views on modality - even though that subject is both knotty and of crucial importance to the understanding of Aristotle's general theory of science. Again, there is virtually nothing on Aristotle's work in the natural sciences: the biological treatises, which occupy a major portion of the surviving corpus and which represent all that is best in Aristotle, are never analysed; zoology does not figure in the index. Guthrie was dying when he wrote the book. It contains much that is good, much that is illuminating. It should be read and it should have been published. But it should not have been published as part of the History, and it is to be hoped that the Cambridge Press will commission a scholar to complete Guthrie's unfinished work. A collection of papers on 'the modern interpretation of Aristotelian logic' should help to compensate for the inadequacies of Guthrie's treatment of the subject. **Uber den Folgerungsbegriff in der aristotelischen Logik'6 is the first volume in a pro- jected series of such collections. But the selection of papers is bizarre: there are several pieces of marginal relevance (and one which has no bearing whatsoever on Aristotle's syllogistic); some of the papers are very slight; there are notable omissions. Moreover, there is no introduction, no index, no bibliography. Many of the papers (all of which have been previously published) first appeared in inaccessible places, and three or four of them are worth possessing. But that will commend the volume only to dedicated specialists in Aristotle's logic. The project is an admirable one: it has made an inauspicious start. Biology - the most serious omission in Guthrie's book - took up much of Aristotle's energy. His biological treatises are, on any account, remarkable works; and they have often occasioned enthusiastic praise. Aristotle, the enthusiasts say, was an indefatigable observer, an experimental and unprejudiced 'scribe of nature' - in short, he was a model scientist. Simon Byl's excellent B**Recherches sur les grands traitis biologiques d' Aristote - sources &amp;crites et prejuges"' argues forcefully that such praise is naive. In biology, as elsewhere, Aristotle made constant use of the writings of his predecessors: he was an encyclopaedist as much as a research scientist. Moreover, the observations he made or reported were often vitiated by 'prejudices' and hindered by what the philosopher Gaston Bachelard has called 'epistemological obstacles'. Facts, in short, are distorted by conscious theorizing and by unconscious preconceptions. Taken generally, none of that is very new: for decades scholars have been eliciting the 'sources ecrites et prejuges' behind Aristotle's scientific and philosophical writings. But Byl's work is the first comprehensive application of that general notion to Aristotle's biological treatises. The attempt contains, I think, some exaggeration; but it is largely successful and uniformly instructive. It should not be thought - nor does Byl think - that the results of Byl's studies diminish Aristotle's standing as a biologist. On the contrary, the naive enthusiasm which Byl rejects rests upon a naive conception of the nature of science - a conception which takes the true scientist to be an autonomous amasser of theory- free particularities. No sensible scientist thinks that he must discover everything for himself; no rational scientist supposes that he should or can produce catalogues of wholly untheoretical 'facts'. Byl's work enhances our understanding of Aristotle's biological studies - and, by a pleasing paradox, shows him in a brighter scientific light. Aristotle's ideas on practical philosophy never want literature. *Essays on Aristotle's Ethics18 contains twenty-one papers, so arranged as to form a quasi-continuous semi-commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics. Twelve of the papers have been published before; none is more than a decade old. Several of the con- tributions are outstandingly good, and the general level of excellence is unusually high for a collection of this kind. (But I do find intensely irritating the pre-publication puffs from famous scholars which American publishers like to stick on the covers of their books.) Every student of Aristotle will want to purchase a copy of the book. That said, let me voice a grumble and issue a caveat. I grumble at the absence of bibliography and indexes. The editor excuses the former lack by referring her readers to an excellent bibliography in Barnes-Schofield-Sorabji's Articles on Aristotle: it is doubtless churlish of me to think the presence of a bibliography in one book does not excuse its absence in another. And there is no excuse for the lack of indexes. Now for the caveat. The editor's preface begins by asserting that 'philosophers and classicists have recently turned their attentions to Aristotle's ethics' - as though attention had not been turned in that general direction for the last several centuries. But the assertion is not casual: the contents of the volume are all terribly modern, that is to say, they represent the current Anglo- American analytical orthodoxy. Now that orthodoxy has a great deal to be said for it - and there is no better tradition of interpretation. But for all that, its approach to Aristotle will be</page><page sequence="21">BRIEF REVIEWS 107 seen by many scholars as blinkered or even quirky. The reader of these Essays will find them enjoyable and stimulating. But he should be aware that other scholars, from other countries or ages, have construed the Ethics in very different ways. The authors of the Essays deal for the most part with the Nicomachean Ethics. Recently, scholars have been equally attentive to the Eudemian version - and that attention is likely to intensify now that Kenny has proved that the books customarily printed as E.N. 5-7 in fact belong to E.E. But E.E. is a peculiarly difficult work, not least because there is as yet no decent critical edition of the Greek text. Michael Woods's Clarendon version of E.E. 1, 2, and 819 marks a significant advance in our under- standing of the treatise. His book, like its fellows in the Clarendon Aristotle Series, furnishes a literal translation of the Greek, followed by philosophico-exegetical notes; in addition, Woods has printed some twenty valuable pages of comments and conjectures on the text. The trans- lation is clear - or at least as clear as Aristotle's Greek permits. The notes are invariably helpful. There are numerous points of detail which Woods has no space to discuss, and some- times he is content to outline rival interpretations without attempting to adjudicate among them; but his edition will prove an indispensable aid to anyone who tries to read the E.E. - and it will be a starting point for future philosophical study of the work. In B*Aristotle the Philosopher20 J. L. Ackrill has written an introductory guide-book to Aristotle's philosophy. He does not tediously expound a sequence of Aristotelian 'doctrines'; rather, he wants to breathe life into Aristotle's texts, and to exhibit him to the reader in the throes of philosophical exertion. Thus Ackrill will first choose a topic (the analysis of change, the concept of ex- planation, the nature of mind), then - by way of extensive quotation and paraphrase - display Aristotle's intellectual wrestlings, and finally raise a few probing questions about the philosophical viability of his notions. The topics Ackrill chooses are all philosophical, in the modern sense (Aristotle's other work is outside Ackrill's scope), and within Aristotle's philosophy Ackrill is perforce selective: some of the main issues in the Physics, de Anima, Analytics, Metaphysics, and Ethics are discussed; but Ackrill does not pretend to do justice to the whole contents of those dense works - and he says nothing at all about, for example, the Rhetoric or the Politics or the Poetics. Some readers will wonder, sceptically, if it is a pure matter of chance that Ackrill's Aristotle emerges as a typical Oxford philosophy don; and they will observe that the philosopher of, say, Enrico Berti's recent Profilo di Aristotele would not find himself so cosily at home in the Brasenose S.C.R. But Ackrill does not claim that his Aristotle is the whole man, nor should a complete portrait be expected from 150 introductory pages. Given its aim and scope, this is a splendid little book: informative, lucid, fair. Ackrill modestly hopes that he will encourage his readers to turn to Aristotle for themselves. He will surely do that; and his own book will justly become the standard introduction to Aristotle's philosophy. I end with two disparate items. Nicholas Denyer's ambitious essay on Time, Action and Necessity2 1 purports to provide a refutation of determinism and a vindication of the freedom of the will. The argument relies on a number of 'Aristotelian insights', and it adverts more than once to the great Hellenistic debates over determinism. The student of ancient philosophy will find stimulating obiter dicta here; but Denyer's book is not a work of history, and I do not think that its author would suggest that it illuminates any problems in the exegesis of ancient texts. (Denyer's argument is indeed spare, carrying no bibliographical or historical baggage. For the most part it is also clear; but even a sympathetic reader will be dismayed by the long lines of Polish symbolism that disfigure the text.) The Arabs played a vital part in the transmission of Aristotle's philosophy to the West. Their writings shed light in two directions - forward, on the history of medieval philosophy, backward, on the Greek tradition and indeed on the text of Aristotle. The first of the great Arabic Aristotelians was al-Farabi (c. 870-950). Of his many commentaries the only one so far recovered in toto is that on the de Interpretatione. The commentary is now available to non- Arabists in Dr F. W. Zimmermann's English edition.22 Zimmermann's lengthy introduction con- veys a mass of information about the early history of logic, and al-Farabi's commentary is itself a learned and thoughtful work which repays close study. (Philosophers will probably turn first to his remarks on Chapter 9, the argument over fatalism; and they will discover a lucid discussion of the perplexities which Aristotle's chapter has caused.) This edition will be required reading for students of Aristotle's logic. It is a great pity that only millionaire students will be able to afford it.

General The first two volumes published jointly by Cambridge and the Fondation de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme have now appeared. **Myth, Religion and Society1 offers a comprehensive introduction to the structuralist school in its several manifestations, since it features generous extracts from Cunning Intelligence (cf. G&amp;R 26 (1979), 210) and Dionysos Slain (cf. G&amp;R 27 (1980), 203), two considerations of Hesiod's Prometheus myth by Vernant, and some splendid material from Vidal-Naquet, including, and in a considerably revised form, his 'black hunter' study of the Athenian ephebeia. Less well known are Detienne on Virgil's Orpheus myth, a paper all the better for being less prolix, and Gernet's seminal discussion of agalmata in which it is shown that the revolution which introduced money was a revolution in both social life and in habits of thought. The other result of this collaborative effort, ** La Mort, les morts dans les societes anciennes,2 provides more than thirty specialist studies, many of which concentrate</page><page sequence="23">BRIEF REVIEWS 109 on Greek material, especially the hero, and draws on both written and archaeological sources, the latter often from southern Italy. Funeral ideology is a potentially exciting topic, but it must be admitted that the names of many contributors here are very familiar and so too is much of what they discuss. Your reviewer has long been interested in Hesiod's succession story and related Near Eastern myths, and here the supposed translation of 'Sanchuniathon' by Philo of Byblos is of great importance, particularly in suggesting a transmission of tradition across the East Mediterranean by Phoenician intermediaries. In B** The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos3 Albert I. Baumgarten has subjected the fragments of Philo to a searching analysis, concluding, not unreasonably, that there is much more in Philo that is Hellenistic, and specifically Euhemeristic, than has been recently allowed. But what of Sanchuniathon himself? Baumgarten is prepared to accept this shadowy figure as 'a religious authority of Phoenician antiquity' but also believes it impossible to isolate in Philo the 'Sanchuniathon-strata'. More important, however, is this scholar's belief that 'Philo and Hesiod preserve a Byblian and a Greek version respectively' (p. 238) of the Kingship in Heaven theme. The boat has been rocked but only gently. Com- parable to Baumgarten is **Le Zeus Cretois4 by H. Verbruggen, who is even more rigorous in his examination of primary evidence and previous scholarship, and demonstrates in detail how our evidence for a Cretan form of Zeus, whether it is literary, numismatic, or archaeological, is mainly of a Hellenistic or Roman date (e.g. Callimachus, the Palaikastro Hymn) and displays clear touches of Euhemerism (e.g. death and tomb of Zeus). A Cretan Zeus there certainly was, but we must not therefore assume that this Zeus was related to a Minoan god, however frequently that assumption has been made. Also comparable to Baumgarten's book since it includes text and translation of the relevant work is BNursling of Mortality5 by Peter Smith. In this essay on the Hymn to Aphrodite it is argued that the underlying concern is the limitation in time of mortal life as exemplified by the contrast between the immortal Aphrodite and the mortal Anchises; a 'modified kind of immortality', however, is offered by offspring such as Aeneas here. What is missing, I feel, is a detailed comparison with other Greek 'birth myths' like that of Zeus, Apollo or Hermes and the consequence of this omission is an altogether slighter investigation than that attempted by both Baumgarten and Verbruggen. Rhetoric Rampant: the Family under Siege in the Early Western Tradition6 is a rather laboured piece whose author, Garth R. Lambert, attempts to demonstrate how the classical concept of reciprocal obligations shared between parents and their children was undermined as Christian asceticism provided a higher way of life for those who abandoned what was thought 'natural' and followed God. No effort, unfortunately, is made to relate this collapse in family solidarity to the wholesale revolution in social and moral values unleashed by an ascendant Church. Women's studies remain in vogue. Heroines and Hysterics' by Mary R. Lefkowitz is a slim offering, three-quarters of whose contents have already appeared elsewhere. Some of its essays are just book reviews, one has nothing to do with Classics, much of the evidence presented is old-hat, and there is a fair amount of repetition. At the same time this unpretentious collection provides stimulating reading and the discussion of 'critical stereotypes and the poetry of Sappho' is a timely warning against biographical criticism. Do I detect a note of prejudice in a reference to 'the more violent sex drive that in most societies appears to be characteristic of men' (p. 38)? In B Womanhood, the Feminine in Ancient Hellenism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam8 Raoul Mortley asks how religion and philosophy influenced woman's place in society at the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire, and early Islam. Woman, apparently, represented the desire of the flesh, men the intellectual principle, though the figure of the androgyne may resolve the predicament of sexual individualism. Certainly this equally slim volume includes interesting discussions of Philo (not of Byblos) on women, women in the Isis cult, women in the Acts and Pauline Epistles, and Plotinus' Sophia, but odd remarks constantly shake one's confidence in the author: can it really be claimed that Isis was the first goddess in classical antiquity with which women could identify (p. 24) or that the emancipation of women was a longstanding Egyptian phenomenon (p. 61)? And I simply cannot follow the story of Helen said to be celebrated in Iliad 2 and Odyssey 4 and 15 (cf. p. 64). But I do like the picture on p. 107 - a wall in Glebe, Sydney, decorated with the slogan 'Eve was framed'. A special double issue of ** Women's Studies9 takes as its theme 'Women in Antiquity', and its ten articles cover the socio-economic roles of women in Mycenaean Greece, Iliad 6, Sappho (twice over), Herodotus, the ability of Greek women to read and write, Etruscan and Late Republic aristocratic society, Creusa and Dido in the Aeneid, and sources on adultery at Rome, a most varied but not necessarily a well-balanced feast. According to the guest-editor, Helene Foley, this is the first journal of the type to introduce</page><page sequence="24">110 BRIEF REVIEWS non-classicists to research in the area of antiquity, and the collection is representative in a number of ways: the contributors are mainly women and young, Greek material is better represented than Roman, the non-literary studies are more convincing. The Ancient Theatre10 by Erika Simon is a brief - there are just 38 pages of text - survey of the archaeological evidence for the staging of Greek and Roman drama. Clear and concise it may be but there are many 'facts' which are not facts but opinions and hotly debated opinions as well. Too many assumptions are made, beginning on p. 2 when we are told that the chorus of the Antigone in its opening song 'actually greets the first rays of the sun'. B* Ships and Fleets of the Ancient Mediterranean"I by Jean Rouge is a pleasant little book which embraces topics such as the construction of ships, 'dominion over the seas', maritime trade and expansion and, less expectedly but only briefly, the religion of seafarers. Clear and to the point, it goes strangely awry in including the First Punic War in a chapter headed 'before the First Punic War'. Levi's Greek atlas (see G&amp;R 28 (1981), 229) now has a companion in *Atlas of the Roman World12 by Tim Cornell and John Matthews. Maps are again supplemented by 'special features' ranging from Early Latium to the Roman Legacy. But there are differences as one consults the four sections, 'Early Italy and the Roman Republic', 'From Republic to Empire', 'Provinces of the Empire', and 'The Empire in Decline': the maps if anything are better but the colours of the pictures inferior; this is as much a history, and a history extending to the Justinian reconquest of the West, as an atlas and is, therefore, more pedestrian, lacking the imaginative and personal quality implanted by Levi. Safer perhaps but not the constant delight of its Greek counterpart, yet still a splendid production. Gustav Hermansen claims that **Ostia, Aspects of Roman City Life'3 is 'a work of interpretation, not an archaeological report', and this is borne out by its emphasis on the guilds of Ostia and their property, on the taverns and their role as 'community centres and trouble spots', on fire hazards and protection against them, and on grain storage. Otherwise we find a sketch of the growth of Ostia and an attempt to make sense of its apartments though here also 'apartment living' is prominent. Plenty of suggestions are made and sensible suggestions too, and these serve to remind us of the huge gaps in our knowledge of even so well known a site. Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity"4 is a collection of essays and reviews published between 1971 and 1977 by Peter Brown, augmented with additional bibliography. As with other books of this character there is a degree of repetition, but this the reader readily excuses when the author is occupied with his two main subjects, the holy man, 'a living icon', and the cult of the saint and historians of late antiquity, Gibbon, Pirenne, and Brown's own contemporaries, to all of whom, with just one exception, this pupil of Momigliano is prepared to be very generous though conscious of their limitations. Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem dates all the way back to the middle of the second century A.D., but it is on this subject at the time of the Church triumphant that E. D. Hunt writes in B**Holy Land Pilgrimage in the Later Roman Empire AD 312-460.15 With Constantine there came lavish construction at Jerusalem and the pilgrimage of Helena; the less illustrious soon followed, and the discovery of the true cross was also soon followed by the recovery of more relics, 'treasured possessions precisely because they were capable of arousing that kind of vivid reaction which the holy places themselves stimulated, and which the church's liturgy mirrored' (p. 129). Luckily the true cross exhibited miraculous powers of regeneration, for by the beginning of the fifth century pieces of it were to be found throughout the Empire. The pilgrimage of the empress Eudocia in 438-39 was followed by her exile to the Holy Land, an event which echoed the role of Helena and, further, reflected the controversies which absorbed so much of the energies of the Church. Although 'intended primarily for students of the Greek Bible', its sub-title 'An Introduction to Greek Palaeography' reveals that Bruce M. Metzger, B Manuscripts of the Greek Bible16 is of a general interest; in fact it includes in Part One brief but instructive accounts of the Greek alphabet, the pronunciation of Greek, the ancient book, the transcribing of Greek manuscripts, and appendices on how to date and to collate these as well as a section on the special features of biblical manuscripts (e.g. nomina sacra). Part Two allows theory to be put into practice with its admirable plates of specimen pages from texts which vary from papyrus scraps to a parchment and paper codex in the Leicester Town Museum. Finally three books which form a 'trilogy' and ought to be read as such, a proposition which justifies the reprint of material otherwise to be found in publications somewhat ephemeral or diverse in character. Hugh Lloyd-Jones supplies a lively introduction and a horde of brief notes to the first English translation of U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, BHistory of Classical Scholarship.'7 This might be thought little more than a historical curiosity, for it is admittedly a short account and dates back to the beginning of the twenties. Wilamowitz, however,</page><page sequence="25">BRIEF REVIEWS 111 tells a story picked up by Lloyd-Jones in Blood for the Ghosts, Classical Influences in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,18 and his introduction fills a gap in this second book as it takes us from Goethe (cf. G&amp;R 29 (1982), 214-15) to Denys Page. The package is completed by Lloyd- Jones with Classical Survivals, the Classics in the Modern World,19 which reprints further book reviews, from TLS and Spectator in the main, and a paper on the Delphic oracle originally appearing in this journal (G&amp;R 23 (1976), 60-73). Throughout our Regius Professor writes with an elegance and wit not always displayed by scholars (cf. Blood for the Ghosts, p. 62 and Classical Survivals, p. 111); while he can be warm in his praise of the deserving, he has some harsh comments to pass in denouncing others - poor Rousseau gets a rough handling as do more recent 'so-called educational experts', whose activity 'means that during these years fewer and fewer people are learning anything at all' (History, p. xxx). Lloyd-Jones makes no secret of his own position: 'I am a Conservative, with very little belief in the intrinsic goodness of human nature' (Blood for the Ghosts, p. 212). There is a whole series of serious messages in the three books, but these are adroitly sugared - the chapter on Max Muiller in Blood for the Ghosts is sheer joy to read. I hesitate to cross swords with so formidable an opponent, but I do feel him ill-advised, in an otherwise magnificent appraisal of Gilbert Murray in Blood for the Ghosts, to describe Murray's Ancient Greek Literature as 'fresh, stimulating and inspiring' (p. 201); I have never recovered from Murray's opinion that Xenophon's Oikonomikos presents us with an instance 'of the modern "bourgeois" ideal of good ordinary women and common- place happy marriages', and Murray was a celebrated liberal! Lloyd-Jones himself refers to 'the insufferably smug lecture of Ischomachus' (Classical Survivals, p. 94). In describing how the younger Wilamowitz and Karl Reinhardt (Blood for the Ghosts, pp. 219ff.; cf. also Classical Survivals, pp. 11llff., a review of John Jones) made us reconsider the role of characterization in Greek tragedy, greater attention needs to be paid to the work of A. M. Dale, and elsewhere Lloyd-Jones is pretty selective in choosing those whose scholarly labours he ranks significant. Still, this trio is to be enjoyed rather than dissected, and it is to be hoped that enjoyment will strengthen the impact of much that Lloyd-Jones has to say about the nature of scholarship and the quality of the Classics.

School Books In The Windows of Elissa1 by Mary Ray we find ourselves in Carthage in the third century B.c. under siege by the Greeks of Syracuse. The war does not go well for the Carthaginians, and at a critical stage Elissa's young sister is taken off to the temple by their fierce aunt Batbaal, the priestess of Tanit. We recall the god's need for human sacrifice and the stage seems set for an exciting story; but this is not to be. Each new development is viewed solely from the viewpoint of Elissa herself, a dutiful thirteen-year old with heavy responsibilities in the family house, and the story returns very quickly to the picture of day-to-day living which, though interesting, gains little from being set in Carthage. Not only devotees of the Cambridge Latin Course will welcome Latin Passages for Translation and Comprehension2 by C. M. Dale. The 49 passages are taken mainly from Pliny and Cicero but ten other prose authors are represented. The amounts of comprehension and translation in the book are roughly equal and the comprehensions are given detailed mark schemes. This last point brings a criticism: in his attempt to make every compre- hension passage yield 20 marks, Dale has had to vary the standard of the questions very consider- ably, and at times it is difficult to see how a sentence can produce sufficient significant points to merit the marks to be awarded. Nevertheless, this is a very useful book and not least among its virtues is the fact that each of the pieces can be attempted in a single lesson. Eleven years after its first appearance, Ecce Romani, the Latin Reading Course prepared by the Scottish Classics Group, has been revised; Pupil Books 1 and 23 and Teacher's Notes 1 and 24 have already come out. Few would disagree with the writers' belief in the need for formal teaching and learning of accidence and vocabulary, over and above the practice gained in these by the completion of the reading passages and exercises, and the recommendations of a variety of methods,including oral drills and simple composition, are sensible. There are changes in the timing of the introduction of some ideas, e.g. the section offering advice on how to decide whether a group 3 noun ending -es is nominative or accusative has been brought forward in the course, most stories have been partly rewritten, and every illustration has been redrawn. However, perhaps the most major innovation in the course is the compilation by the same team of a companion volume, Roman Studies Handbook,' to help with the paralinguistic element. This slim and carefully organized booklet firstly lists the books, filmstrips, wallcharts, and films that a school may reasonably be expected to possess or be able to borrow and then, under eighteen topic headings, tells pupils where to find material in the listed items and indicates the range and depth of the information given. The overall standard of accuracy is high, but one hopes that the note on page 19 will not deter youthful readers from searching out the excellent, and cheap, publications of the Istituto Geografico De Agostini-Novara, for these are available with English text and notes. Society in Imperial Rome' by Michael Massey seeks to illustrate four themes of Roman social life: Life in the City, Dining out, Roman Women, and Roman Slavery. Each section consists of a short introduction followed by translations from Roman writers of the period. Editorial guidance is brief, perhaps too brief. One wonders what impression of Roman women will be left on the average sixteen-year old by the choice of material from Juvenal's Satire 6, Pliny's descriptions of Fannia and Arria, and Tacitus' account of Poppaea's arrangements for the death of Octavia. Some teachers may feel that their pupils would have gained more from shorter extracts drawn from a wider range of material and pointed with more instructive comment. Ancient comedy poses a particular problem for the translator and *Plautus, Rudens, Curculio, Casina7 has the added difficulty of being intended for the highly critical readers who study classical literature only in translation: highly critical because they are less likely to make allowances for infelicities or ambiguities than those able to consult the original text. Christopher Stace has risen well to this challenge. His introduction and notes are kept deliberately brief for the plays are expected to carry themselves along, helped only by interposed stage directions. Those who seek a crib should look elsewhere, but those who wish to read these plays or to act them could not buy an edition whose English is more well-chosen or whose pace is more lively. BPlautus' Menaechi,8 edited by Gilbert Lawall and Betty Nye Quinn and now in its second edition, sets out to make Plautus attainable and enjoyable for sixth formers and first-year undergraduates. The format is admirable: vocabularies face the text, which is interrupted from time to time to admit stage directions, and notes on language and on essential</page><page sequence="27">BRIEF REVIEWS 113 background are placed with the vocabulary, while occasional questions about the play and about wider issues of social life (e.g. 889ff., 'Is this scene a burlesque of the fashionable doctor or is it a straight portrayal of an important professional? What is the status of the doctor in this period?') are set at the foot of the relevant page. All this, together with the detailed summary of the plot which ends the introduction, should ensure that a tiro reads accurately enough to please the strictest teacher and fluently enough not to lose sight of the plot and the humour. At a time when the trend in ancient history teaching is towards matters social and economic, the study of warfare continues to exercise a peculiar attraction for many pupils, and they will welcome two new source-cum-commentary books, *Herodotus, The Persian War9 by William Shepherd, and B Alexander the Great: Selections from Arrian'0 by J. G. Lloyd. The two books are intended for '0' level and C.S.E. candidates and follow the same plan of a short introduction and then translations which alternate with the translator's summaries of important passages otherwise omitted or his critical commentaries; both books list the passages translated and have an index of names and subjects. Shepherd begins his Herodotus selection with the Ionian War of Book 5, having decided that Books 1 to 4 are too tenuously linked to the main theme to permit inclusion in so slim a volume. Even so, he has been hard put to it to shorten the text to the required length and the summaries, in particular, need to be viewed critically to see if reasonable justice is being done to the story as told by Herodotus. The inclusion of the messenger's speech from the Persae augments the account of Salamis, but the map of the Saronic gulf is too lacking in detail to be of much value, a fault also true of the map of Plataea. However, the translation is attractive, the commentary is sensible, and the topic is of perennial interest. In some ways Lloyd's difficulties with Arrian are less than those facing Shepherd. Firstly, Lloyd is able to include extracts from every book of the original text, for Arrian's work is more tightly relevant to its main subject than is the account of Herodotus; secondly, Lloyd has the advantage of a single dominant personality on which to focus, and there is less inherent disjointedness in his task. How much of the Arrian account should be believed is not a question that can easily be attempted with young readers and Lloyd has neatly cut this Gordian knot with two sentences in his introduction: 'We can only use our common sense in assessing what we read. But this book presents the story as Arrian told it.' It does indeed. A brand new publication from the American company of Bolchazy-Carducci is B Plato, Apology" consisting of Burnet's O.C. T. text of 1924 and a grammatical commentary by James J. Helm. Helm sees his job as to instruct a novice in the correct way to read Greek; emphasis is on lexicon and grammar and where translation help is offered, he gives a word rather than a phrase or a phrase rather than a sentence. For help with the philosophical ideas in the text and even with important background questions the student is referred to the select bibliography listed at the end. For schools, at least, this approach will not do. A vocabulary is needed and wider all- round assistance because, as the commentary stands, Helm's intended young pupil will need to be highly motivated, unusually perceptive, and free from other commitments. In every sense a happier publication from the same company is the second edition of BPetronius, Selections from the Satiricon' 2 with introduction, notes, and vocabulary by Gilbert Lawall. The bulk of the text is from the Dinner Party, but this is preceded by the episode of the losing and the regaining of a tunic lined with stolen gold, and it is followed by the story of The Matron of Ephesus, The Death of Lichas, and the short and bizarre Eating Human Flesh for Money. Lawall's choice of extract will not be everybody's, and a perhaps surprising omission is that of sections 35-38 in which a description of the excesses in the food for the dinner leads directly to a description of the excesses of the wealth enjoyed by Trimalchio and by his freedmen, topics central to the satirical element of the work. However, the sections that are included are great fun and that is surely the intention of Lawall, and of Petronius! The three plays translated by Neil Curry in *Euripides, The Trojan Women, Helen, The Bacchae'3 are an ambitious choice for 'O' level and C.S.E. readers. The fact that these plays appear together in one volume must owe little to any similarity of plot or of treatment (they could hardly differ more from one another in these respects!) and a lot to their individual merits and to the possibilities of meeting, in a young audience, recognition of and imaginative response to the human issues treated: sympathy for the victims of war, for example. Curry achieves much success in communicating the plays, and this book both maintains the high standards of presentation and translation of the imaginative series from which it comes and leads one to hope for further titles.

Havelock has added a 'reappraisal' to a 1982 reprint of twelve of his papers on the oral character of Greek culture before the fourth century B.C., The Literate Revolution in Greece and its Cultural Consequences,' the first non-literature volume in the Princeton Series of Collected Essays. These benefit considerably from being presented in an order which makes for a logical progression of argument. Havelock's tone is polemical, for he does not seem to appreciate the extent to which his views have won acceptance: your reviewer, for example, comes in for criticism (p. 32 n. 2), though he has acknowledged his debt to the American scholar and attempted to build on foundations laid by Havelock (see my Greek Drama in its Theatrical and Social Context, pp. 22ff.). Of a special interest is Havelock's most recent paper, an examination into the oral com- position of Greek drama (pp. 261ff.), where the didactic function of the dramatist is illustrated from the Frogs and the Seven against Thebes - 'Athenian drama came into existence as a supplement to Homer, designed as a storage mechanism for the oral re-enactment and consolidation of the mores of an essentially pre-literate community' (p. 279). As becomes an advocate of the spoken word, though sadly reduced here to the ultimate, the use of photoreproduction, Havelock coins phrases which ring in the ears and the sweep of his argument carries the reader along, less convincingly, however, in his interpretation of particular passages from, for example, the Frogs and verses 11-41 of the Works and Days. An especially welcome addition in 1982 to Methuen University Paperbacks is the English version of Myth and Society in Ancient Greece2 by Jean-Pierre Vernant (see G&amp;R 28 (1981), 113), since extracts or articles provide students with the best introduction to the methodology of the French structuralists, and this is just about the most suitable collection of such pieces. Warmly received when first published by Thames and Hudson in 1979 (see G&amp;R 27 (1980), 99), John Onians, B**Art and Thought in the Hellenistic Age3 was issued as a paperback in 1982. Its illustrations alone make it an attractive purchase, and there is further a demanding but rewarding text which presents Hellenistic art in a total context. A new and revised edition published in 1982 by Chatto and Windus of the magni- ficently detailed and illustrated BPetra4 enables Iain Browning to up-date his account of the 'rose- red city' and so include such material as the 1980 discovery of Nabatean pottery kilns (p. 38) and the Atargatis temple excavated between 1974 and 1978 (pp. 139-40). The British Museum and its Collections,5 the 1982 revised and retitled guide to the BM, includes sections on its Greek and Roman antiquities (pp. 57-88) and prehistoric and Romano-British antiquities (pp. 153-84). Outstanding among its many varied illustrations is a colour plate of a part of the painted wall- plaster from the Lullingstone villa (p. 180). Originally published in 1913 and having passed through twenty impressions, The Englishman's Pocket Latin-English and English-Latin Dictionary6</page><page sequence="29">BRIEF REVIEWS 115 has been reprinted in 1982 by Routledge and Kegan Paul for the first time as a paperback. The title has an archaic flavour about it and this dictionary in general sports an old-fashioned look. At the same time it is convenient, cheap, and reliable if limited. P. WALCOT NOTES 1.
