<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Rooms with a View: An Inquiry into Film Adaptation JUNE PERRY LEVINE A Room with a View, produced by Ismail Merchant and directed by James Ivory, is a successful adaptation: the film is esthetically whole and delightful in itself and, for the most part, remains true to the spirit as well as faithful to the letter of E.M. Forster's novel. Following so soon after David Lean's unsatisfactory adaptation of A Passage to India, the Merchant-Ivory film may provide support for the thesis that slight novels are easier to adapt than complex ones. Such a situation, however, should not be seen as diminishing the accomplishment of this particular instance, especially the skill with which Ruth Prawer Jhabvala has rendered the script. The filmmakers obviously had confidence that Forster's novel is still of interest, that its theme, despite the Edwardian setting, can speak to contemporary audiences, that its story could engross them, and its dialogue remain witty today. The success of their undertaking is rooted in this confidence. They did not find the novel quaint and they did not patronize it. Although the challenges involved in adapting A Room with a View are specific to Forster's text, every translation of novel into film must deal with the differences between the two media in the rendering of narrative structure, tone, character ization, thematics and presentation. In this sense, an analysis of the Merchant Ivory production lends itself to the development of a subsection of the general theory of adaptation usefully articulated by Donald F. Larsson (74): those films whose purpose is to reproduce the literary text within the possibilities of the film medium rather than to alter or subvert it. Such films, because their impetus is Mosaic 22/3 0027-1276-89/010067-18$01,50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">68 June Perry Levine translation, can reveal more about the operation of traditionally conceived categories of texts than can films whose purpose is to change or undermine the literary text. If one defines narrative as the relationships posited by the text as "a condition of its intelligibility" (Branigan 3), then the film of A Room with a View appears to follow the narrative structure of Forster's novel closely, although detailed com parison reveals more changes than are apparent at first viewing. Unlike the changes made in many adaptations, this script strengthens the narrative line by using the principle of following an action to its culmination rather than interrupting the action with scenes of exposition, elaboration and complication. Thus, the script is linear and propulsive where the novel is mosaic and discursive. Both novel and film begin at the Pension Bertolini in Florence. Among the guests—all English—are Lucy Honeychurch, a young woman accompanied by her older cousin, Charlotte Bartlett; a retired journalist named Emerson and his son George; Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who believes herself to be liberated from con vention; and an Anglican clergyman, the Reverend Beebe. Forster's first chapter ends with an exchange of rooms between the Emersons, who have a view, and Lucy and Charlotte, who desire one, despite Charlotte's dismay at the impropriety of being under an obligation to strangers who clearly "did not do" (Room 18). Forster's second chapter, "In Santa Croce with No Baedeker," has Eleanor Lavish taking Lucy for a visit to the church but abandoning her so that Lucy goes inside alone and falls into conversation with Mr. Emerson who importunes her to make his unhappy son understand that "by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes" (32). Chapter Three, "Music, Violets, and the Letter'S'," returns to the Bertolini. Lucy plays Beethoven, Mr. Beebe listens, they talk, and she then goes out to the Piazza Signoria. The fourth chapter follows Lucy, after a discussion of her character by the narrator. Witnessing a murder at close hand, she is assisted by George Emerson with whom she walks back along the Arno to the pension. The film, after a parallel initial sequence dramatizing the exchange of rooms, moves to Lucy playing the piano as Mr. Beebe listens (Forster's third chapter), and then depicts her going out to the church. In crosscut scenes, it is Charlotte who accompanies Eleanor on the tour of Florence—thus, from early on, emphasizing their relationship. Lucy encounters the Emersons in the church (Forster's second chapter), and then exits into the Piazza where the murder occurs, George comes to her aid, and they walk along the river (Forster's fourth chapter). Thus, the piano scene, a largely expository section of the novel, is shifted forward in the film so that the narrative can move from Santa Croce directly to the murder and the bond that forms between Lucy and George as a result of their shared encounter with mortality. The film proceeds immediately to the Fiesole outing, omitting Forster's preparatory chapter, "Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing." The climax of the first half of both film and novel is George's kissing Lucy in a field near Fiesole. The falling action of both is the return to the pension and Lucy and Charlotte's abrupt flight from Florence in the face of George's advances.</page><page sequence="3">Film Adaptation 69 The second half of both the novel and film is set in England. Again, the film reorders Forster's chapters to create an unbroken narrative line sacrificing analysis and suspense for dramatic momentum. Eliding several months of chronological time, Part Two of both film and novel begins with the announcement of Lucy's engagement to Cecil Vyse at her home, Windy Corner, in Surrey, and continues with a garden party, Lucy and Cecil's walk to a small pond, the Sacred Lake, and their unsuccessful kiss at its edge. At this point, in the chapter titled "Cecil as Humorist," Forster has Lucy ' s brother Freddy reveal that the Emersons have rented a local villa, one that Lucy has been arranging to be let to acquaintances from the Bertolini, the Alan sisters. Moreover, it is Cecil who has, ironically, engineered the arrival of the Emersons. Cecil explains to the much agitated Lucy that, at the National Gallery, he had fallen into conversation with the Emersons, in front of Luca Signorelli in the novel, in front of Uccello's magnificent Niccolo la Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano in the film. Cecil had learned that they were looking for a country place to rent and thought this humble pair provided him with a won derful opportunity to "score" against the owner of the villa, whom Cecil considers pretentious. Forster's next chapter, "In Mrs. Vyse's Weil-Appointed Flat," takes Cecil and Lucy to visit Cecil's mother in London while the Emersons move into Cissie Villa. Forster then returns to Surrey: Freddy and Mr. Beebe take George swimming at the Sacred Lake. They are discovered in naked frolic by Mrs. Honey church, Cecil and Lucy who are out for a stroll. Then, in order to further the intensity in Lucy's mind of what happened in Florence, Forster introduces a visit to Windy Corner by Charlotte Bartlett. The structure of the film follows the scenes of the engagement, garden party and kiss at the Sacred Lake. Instead of introducing at this juncture the news of the Emersons' arrival into the community, however, the script moves ahead to the London sequence in Mrs. Vyse's home. Only with her return to Windy Corner does Lucy discover that Cecil has muddled in the renting of the villa. This develop ment is followed immediately by Freddy and Mr. Beebe's taking George swimming, Lucy's seeing Georged naked, and the distressing announcement of Charlotte's forthcoming visit. Forster uses the London interlude to analyze the struggle within Lucy now that she knows that George will be living near her and before having the pair confront each other. Jhabvala's script disposes of the sequence in Mrs. Vyse's flat earlier so that the narrative line can move directly through the action of the intensifying romantic conflict. The remainder of the film, like much that has gone before, largely follows the structure of the novel. Thus, although the script does not extensively restructure Forster's narrative, the changes that are made remind the viewer that commercial cinema feels constrained to provide its audience with an energetic movement of the plot, whereas the novel form has traditionally accommodated elaboration and divergence. Cinema does have the means to render literary narrative structure directly; although this practice would make films based on novels exceedingly long, verbal connec</page><page sequence="4">70 June Perry Levine tions can be translated without insuperable difficulty into visual constructions. Much more complex is the problem in conveying literary tone, "the implicit eval uation which the author manages to convey beyond his explicit evaluation" (Booth 74). Novels, of course, express tone solely through verbal language, primarily but not exclusively that of the narrator, whether first or third person, and the characters. Unless film employs a narrator, most frequently as a voice-over, verbal language is usually confined to the characters. Thus a major means of creating tone is lost. What cinema does have for this purpose is camera positioning, editing and sound —especially the musical score. The tone of A Room with a View is often ironic which, although reproducible, is not a voice that comes easily to film since its agency is so often the narrator. Much of Forster's novel, however, also has a romantic tenor, and this is a tone that can be perceived virtually unmediated in cinema, for example through the images of the characters in particular settings. Thus, a major tonal problem for the filmmakers in A Room with a View is to avoid having the romance overwhelm the irony. When Forster's narrator explains why Lucy and Charlotte each insists that the other must have a room with a view—"they were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled" (4)—he provides an amusing gloss for the dialogue that the film makers must omit unless it can be conveyed through the actors' performances. When Forster's narrator describes the violets that surround Lucy and George at their first kiss—"but never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth" (80)— the filmmakers' task is primarily to find an appropriate location for the scene and photograph it to achieve this effect. (The film production, however, unaccountably uses yellow-flowering barley, spoiling the water image.) The novel's chapter headings are an obvious device through which the Forsterian voice is expressed: they convey attitude as well as narrative information. The film makers' decision to retain many of them—while it may distress the dwindling band of purists who hold that the reproduction of written text is essentially antifilmic— works well to create the distance that is often an element of the ironic tone because the juxtaposition of written text with image is self-reflexive. The clearest example of this device is seen in the most elaborate title: "The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them." Laid on as a subscript to the opening frames of the sequence, the title delights audiences, not only, I think, because of the lengthy enumeration of personages, but because the brief second clause so neatly under cuts the first. Forster's social comment on the relationship between the tourists and the Italian people informs a minor theme in the novel which I will take up later. By using the novel's verbal irony, the filmmakers are both being true to the letter of the novel and underscoring Forster's playful allusion to the chapter headings of an earlier period; more important, they are also presenting, with great economy, an idea including the tone with which it is stated—not easily rendered by any other means. The series of four related chapter headings which the film also uses—"Lying to George," "Lying to Cecil," "Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and</page><page sequence="5">Film Adaptation 71 the Servants," and "Lying to Mr. Emerson"—aside from intensifying the narrative rhythm, also shapes the narrator's amused and urbane insistence on Lucy's muddle. Another chapter heading that the script employs—"How Miss Bartlett's Boiler Was So Tiresome"—allows the film to use the characters' idiom but, by isolating their language through the technique of foregrounding the title, also to render it accurately and to make apparent its comic anthropomorphism. Book and chapter titles, along with the names of characters, perhaps more than any other verbal devices, reveal the presence of the "implied author" (Chatman, Story 147-51). By choosing to feature so many of the titles, Ivory and Jhabvala reproduce directly in the film the Forsterian voice. The most obvious means of transposing the tone of a novel to its film adaptation is by employing as much of the original dialogue as possible. The script of A Room with a View certainly does this. Moreover, when the script adds lines, as, for example, when Mr. Emerson explains at the Bertolini dinner table why he will gladly exchange his room with a view—"My vision is within. Here is where the birds sing"—the lines sound so true to character and so familiarly Forsterian that one is surprised not to find them in the novel. Not only does the film retain much of Forster's dialogue; it emphasizes it. The cast's skilled delivery is partly respon sible; however, camera work accounts for much of the emphasis. Instead of fre quently shooting the face of the listener to off-camera speech, as in Godard-influ enced filming, Ivory directs the camera to the speaker and occasionally stops movement in the frame during important dialogue. If the film serves the dialogue well, this is an accomplishment that requires sensitivity rather than ingenuity. What seems more impressive is how the script is able, albeit infrequently, to render the narrator's comments by transposing them into lines for the characters. When this feat is done successfully, not only is the speech credible in the mouth of the actor and thus not lost to the film, but the tone of the novel is allowed fuller entry and, when the transposition is especially well conceived, a new level of irony is introduced. Sometimes, however, the narrative voice cannot, without a great wrenching of the material, be accommodated, and then even skillful adjustments in the script do not quite compensate for the loss. For example, after Cecil kisses Lucy at the edge of the Sacred Lake, Forster writes: He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity. "Emerson was the name, not Harris." "What name?" "The old man's." "What old man?" "That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to." He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had. (125) After the kiss, the film renders Lucy's dialogue: "Those people at the pension were extraordinary," and follows this with a flashback—surely from Lucy's perspective —of George's kissing her in the field of barley. Thus, cinema has within its own</page><page sequence="6">72 June Perry Levine language little more difficulty rendering the interior mental process of a character than does a novel: Lucy compares, more explicitly in the film, Cecil's kiss to George's. The film audience reads this easily as the subjective flow of Lucy's consciousness and is aware of the irony of her introductory line of dialogue. The narrator's pointed comment—that Lucy's laconic remark was the most intimate conversation that she and Cecil had ever had—is, however, very difficult to convey plausibly and economically. Sometimes it is possible to intimate the tone of the narrator's comment by camera work, including framing. When, after the murder, Lucy and George are standing side by side, looking at the Arno, the novel's narrator remarks: "There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship" (52). No irony here. The film renders this scene by framing George and Lucy within another frame, an arch, and reversing the angle to a shot behind them, and then reversing again to the initial shot. When the camera moves closer, they are still contained within a symmetrical composition created by the pillars on either side of them. Thus, the magical "identity of position" commented on by the narrator is reinforced by the editing and composition of the shots and conveys the feeling of Lucy and George's new-found intimacy. Seymour Chatman to the con trary, then, the camera is not "powerless to invoke tone" ("Novels" 132): "Stylistic devices... can be taken as the narration's commentary" (Bordwell 209), and com mentary is tonal. Editing, especially montage editing, can, if done perceptively, translate literary tone. In keeping with the straightforward narrative thrust of the fdm, there is very little montage of the sort discussed above in the flashback scene at the Sacred Lake. The fdmmakers clearly felt, however, that the dramatic murder in Piazza Signoria had to be introduced with preparatory foreboding: a five-shot montage that includes a low-angle shot of Cellini's Perseus Holding Medusa's Head, a level, close-up shot of the dagger in his hand, and a menacing close-up showing the bared teeth of a statuary dog. The shots are cut quickly and accompanied by a score which is much more discordant than the music that has been heard thus far on the sound track: the rhythm is heavy and the chords increase the sense of dreadful portent. Curiously, this mood is very different from that with which Forster introduces the murder in the Piazza: The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance to a cave, wherein dwelt many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of man kind. It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that suffi cient was happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more. She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes (48)</page><page sequence="7">Film Adaptation 73 The narrator's tone is somber but meditative, evoking the twilight world of the gods, a shadowy ambience in which reality changes its shape. His second para graph, employing phallic symbology that recurs in Forster's work, completes his preparation: Lucy and George will discover both mortality and their response to it, a love that will be their kinship to the gods. The marked difference here between the tone of the novel and the film suggests that the filmmakers decided to replace Forster's complex nuances with a punchy montage depicting mythic violence quickly evolving into modern violence, saving the effect on George and Lucy until the Arno scene that follows the Piazza. Again in the film, the emphasis on the dramatic action of the narrative determines form and, thus, tone. Another montage series is inserted in the movie. Shortly after George kisses Lucy, Charlotte's discovery of the pair leads to the hasty decampment of the entire party. A storm is brewing. George refuses to return to Florence in the horse-drawn carriages: he says that he will walk. In the novel, we have nothing of George's return except his arrival later that night at the pension. Förster focuses on Lucy's response to the situation, which is more timorous than in the film. The filmmakers, however, want the audience to see the effect that love has on the previously dour George. To this end, they include a three-shot montage of him running joyously through the rain to the accompaniment of thunder and a bit of storm music. This fleshing out of the character is a good idea, not only because it gives more sub stance to his role in the ensuing triangle, but because it sustains the ecstatic tone that Forster created in his description of the violets preceding the kiss. The thunder storm maintains the water/fertility idea even as it suggests that, for the lovers, the path ahead will be turbulent. Novelists can incorporate music into their work by allusion, description and analysis, but it is far more difficult, even for a writer like Forster who is always using music, to generate the sound of the composition. Whereas the novelist explicitly creates the voice of the narrator, music can be made audible only indirectly. The problem for film is reversed: the narrative voice, unless a voice-over is used, must be incorporated transformationally, but the music only alluded to in the novel—in this case Beethoven, Schubert, music hall ditties, a sentimental lament—can in the film be heard directly. Moreover, the accompanying musical score, a convention of most narrative filmmaking, is a major element in expressing the emotional tone of the script. The score that Richard Robbins has composed for A Room with a View serves the script well, but the boldest decision in constructing the sound track was to use two Puccini arias to accompany major sections of the narrative. The film opens with "O Mio Babbino Card' from Gianni Schicchi, itself set in Florence. A lilting, yet wistful, romantic melody, sung by Kiri Te Kanawa, this aria establishes a perva sive tone throughout the film. The resolution of the plot—Charlotte's reading Lucy ' s letter from Florence, cut to Lucy and George now married and staying at the Bertolini—is also accompanied by this aria. For the crucial scene of the lovers' first kiss in the countryside near Fiesole, another Puccini aria has been chosen: "Chi il Bel Sogno di Doretta" from La Rondine. Also performed by Kiri Te Kanawa, accompanied by full orchestra, this meltingly beautiful song overflows with enough</page><page sequence="8">74 June Perry Levine romantic feeling to swamp the frequently ironic tone of the novel. Perhaps the filmmakers feared that grand passion and grand opera were tipping the delicate balance of Forster's voicing because the second half of the film restores the balance. When George kisses Lucy the second time—directly after Cecil has unwittingly read to them, with great amusement, from Eleanor Lavish's newly published novel, her version of the first embrace—the musical accompaniment is a jaunty habanera. George follows Lucy purposefully toward the house, Lucy is caught unawares, and Cecil walks by, his nose still in the novel, chuckling. The music is mocking and reminds us of the irony of Cecil's calling his maneuver to bring the Emersons into the neighborhood a "Victory for the Comic Muse." He had, in fact, gone so far as to announce, referring to the villa's landlord, that "anything is fair that punishes a snob" (135). After Lucy has misled everyone, including herself, about her feelings for George, she sings a song of renunciation, accompanying herself on the piano. Forster gives the words, including the final couplet: "Vacant heart and hand and eye / Easy live and quiet die" (222). Freddy comments in novel and film: "The tune's right enough ... but the words are rotten. Why throw up the sponge?" (221 ). His pithy response is, if anything, strengthened in the film by our actually hearing the whole song. As implied throughout, Lucy is in danger of becoming another Charlotte Bartlett. In listing in his Commonplace Book, late in his life, the characters that he had created "for whom I care," Forster included Lucy in the company of Gino of Where Angels Fear to Tread, Stephen of The Longest Journey, Aziz in A Passage to India, Lionel and Cocoa in "The Other Boat" and Alec and Maurice in Maurice (218). Probably he identified Lucy's muddle with his own as a young man. Despite his affection for Lucy, however, and although the plot of A Room with a View centers on the love triangle, the young people are not the most complex characters in the novel. Charlotte Bartlett and the Reverend Beebe are, I think, more interest ing figures. The film uses considerable ingenuity in rendering Charlotte, while Mr. Beebe is greatly simplified. Given Forster's uncertainty about the role of the clergyman, which can be seen in the manuscript revisions, the script's flattening of Mr. Beebe may not have been the wrong decision. Incidentally, Ivory (see "Room"), and presumably Jhabvala, was familiar with these manuscript versions, which have been published as The Lucy Novels. Although the film sometimes plays as if Mr. Beebe may be romantically inclined toward Lucy, Forster's manuscript fragments imply that the inclination is toward George. In one passage, not included in the published work, Mr. Beebe tells George: "We all think of you as a hero in a novel.. .you are young, strong, quite good looking.. .tinged with an interesting sadness You're what the cads call irresistible" (Lucy Ms 5:163-64). In one version of the ending, Mr. Beebe strongly influences Lucy against marrying George. When George is subsequently killed by a tree that blows down in a gale, the clergyman is overcome with guilt (X8:10, 14). Although these were tentative and ultimately rejected ideas, the published novel</page><page sequence="9">Film Adaptation 75 describes Mr. Beebe, upon learning that Lucy loves George, as "a long black column"; "his white face with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman" (239). Also, Forster's Beebe recognizes Cecil as "an ideal bachelor," like himself "better detached" (98). Later, when Lucy breaks the engagement, the narrator says: "[Mr. Beebe's] belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower. 'They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better. ' So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure" (219). There is something of the ascetic in him: "Mr. Beebe was, for rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex" (38). When he learns of Lucy's attachment to George, he is not only disappointed but loses interest in both of them. Although he had said earlier that "if Miss Honey church ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting—both for us and for her" (36), when Lucy rejects convention for passion, Mr. Beebe clearly finds this the wrong sort of excitement. This complex figure does not find his way into the film, whose Mr. Beebe remains jovial throughout and plays no part in the resolution of Lucy's love affair. In a famous dictum, Forster says: "a novel often requires flat people as well as round" (Aspects 71). So do films, but whereas Mr. Beebe has been simplified the film's Charlotte Bartlett is multidimensional. Forster goes on to say that "the test of a round character is whether it is capable of surprising in a convincing way" (78). In the final chapter of the novel, which is very brief, George and Lucy devote much of their conversation to an analysis of Charlotte's role in their relationship, even though they have returned to the pension for a romantic honeymoon. Lucy excoriates Charlotte, believing that George and she were lucky that Charlotte did not know that Mr. Emerson was at the Reverend's house the evening of Lucy's visit before her planned departure for Greece: "for she would have stopped me going in, and [your father] was the only person alive who could have made me see sense" (244). George insists that Charlotte did know that Mr. Emerson was in the study, although the novel does not depict any encounter between the two: his father saw Charlotte with his own eyes. George presents his theory: I'll put a marvel to you. That your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down. That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn't have described us as she did to her friend [Eleanor Lavish] She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through In the Rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behavior, she is glad. (245-46) This view of the unexpected levels of Charlotte's character is not conveyed in the final scene of the film. The script's intention for the ending is to depict the joy of Lucy and George's embrace in the room with a view, to show that they have tri umphed over the pressure of social convention. Ivory has said: "we've tried to keep</page><page sequence="10">76 June Perry Levine the values of the book, with its emphasis upon spiritual liberation, intact" (Billing ton 16). Nevertheless, Charlotte's role in uniting the lovers has not been ignored, only restructured. In the novel, Lucy enters the parsonage study and finds Mr. Emerson alone, waiting for the moving men to finish taking the furniture out of Cissie Villa; she learns that George and he have, following the dashing of George's hopes, decided to relocate. It is Lucy herself who tells Mr. Emerson of her broken engagement to Cecil after she has been painted into a corner by a remark from Mr. Beebe who has just entered. Mr. Emerson understands immediately the underlying reasons for Lucy's decision. The script makes a significant change in this scene by introducing a conversation in the study between Charlotte and Mr. Emerson before Lucy's arrival. Charlotte, for no apparent reason, tells him about the broken engagement. Mr. Emerson is exultant and confronts Lucy as soon as she comes in. When, in the novel. Lucy finally rejoins her waiting mother and cousin in the carriage, Charlotte has no dialogue. From the indirect and unelicited discourse of "[Lucy] spoke at once" (240), the novel moves immediately to the last chapter with Lucy and George at the Bertolini. In the film, however, when Lucy comes out into the carriage, Charlotte says pointedly: "I think Lucy has something to tell us," indicating a measure of complicity and anticipation. The film then adds a brief but important scene before the return to the Bertolini. Charlotte is lying in bed reading a letter from Lucy which we hear as a voice-over. A lamp sheds a golden glow, Puccini plays on the soundtrack, Charlotte's hair is, for the first time, loose, her nightgown is bridal white, and the expression on her face appears to be one of serene satisfac tion. Only then is the cut made to Lucy and George at the pension. By these means the script dramatizes George's theory that Charlotte had always hoped "far down in her mind" for their marriage. This idea is implied by a crucial question from the novel that the script retains. After having heard Cecil read Eleanor's fictionalized version of George's kiss, Lucy angrily confronts Charlotte, asking why she has told what she had witnessed on the outing. Charlotte does not, perhaps cannot, respond to the question, but George's explanation is apt: since that day, the picture of the lovers has "burnt" in Charlotte's imagination. The script adds other material to support the contention that Charlotte is a secret romantic. During the outing whose action culminates in the kiss, Charlotte deli cately confides in Eleanor about a vacation that she took long ago. Eleanor con cludes that her friend had "an adventure," although I do not think that we are to make much of her speculation. The two women go on to discuss an English woman who went to Italy, married an Italian ten years her junior, and remained at Monteriano rather than returning home. Some viewers will recognize this as the plot of Förster's Where Angels Fear to Tread. Its unemphatic but amusing inclusion in this scene serves two functions: Charlotte is titillated by the story, which offers an insight into her barely repressed fantasy life, and the women's desire to gossip in private leads them to drive off Lucy, sending her in reluctant search of the men, and making Charlotte, ironically, responsible for Lucy's unchaperoned encounter with George. Thus, ambivalences emanate from Charlotte and redound. Lucy refers to her cousin at the novel's end as "dreadful frozen Charlotte," but Ivory and Jhabvala—like</page><page sequence="11">Film Adaptation 77 Forster—show that this judgment is imprecise. The film's means of portraying Charlotte, although different, are effective and, perhaps, more subtle, employing both wordless imagery and dramatic rather than analytical dialogue. One reason that A Room with a View is a satisfying novel is that the characters make manifest its themes. Two important subthemes are, however, rather slighted in the film. The idea that Forster labeled "feudalism" can be found only in occa sional dialogue and a bit of action. The iconography of Italy, Greece and the gods —antifeudal emblems—only occasionally informs the dialogue and imagery. Yet these themes represent the opposing forces that are vying for Lucy's allegiance, and her choice between them determines the direction of her life. Two of Forster's chapter headings not used in the film are "Medieval," which opens the second part of the novel, and "The End of the Middle Ages," which is the title of the final chapter. Cecil is the locus of the metaphor of feudalism although, as I have indicated, Mr. Beebe inhabits its outer edges. Forster is explicit about Cecil's ideological function in the pattern of the novel: Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He was medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral. Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modem world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with a dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition (99-100) Forster, then, is contrasting the asceticism which is a component in the idea that he calls feudalism with the life-giving fruitfulness he derives from the idea of Greece. The novel's narrator comments that "the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected" (179). This extension of the concept into vassalage—the relation between the strong and the weak—directly affects his connection with Lucy. A glimpse of protectiveness is added in the film when Cecil carefully and conventionally positions himself between Lucy and the roadway during a walk; such behavior Forster, in a different context, calls "the worn-out chivalry of sex" (235). George, of course, is the character who opposes Cecil's position. Lucy knows early on that "George lacked chivalry" (52). In a speech which the film fortunately retains, George, trying to prevail upon Lucy not to reject him and marry Cecil, inveighs against the feudal attitude: "Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren't let a woman decide. He's the type who's kept Europe back for a thou sand years. Every moment of his life he's forming you, telling you what's charm ing or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of your own" (194).</page><page sequence="12">78 June Perry Levine Since Forster's personal misogyny is indicated in much of his private writing, this rhetoric, which sounds contemporary and feminist and comes from a character of whom he obviously approves, may be surprising, but Forster's philosophical vision has a political aspect: he always writes against forces of the Establishment exacting control over the less powerful, whom he wants to see empowered. The narrator, in accordance with the novel's schema, says: "Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady" (47). The film, perhaps deliberately, eases the novel's burden of ideology. Daniel Day Lewis amusingly portrays Cecil as an Edwardian dandy whose estheticism is more pronounced than his asceticism in the performance. Stuffy and comical, his need to control—"protect"—is less evident. Julian Sand's George has fewer rough edges than the novel's character, and I think that Forster would find this conception proportionately less heroic than his own. Much of Forster's fiction is frequented by the gods of Greece and Rome. The minor deities are his favorites: they allow him to have his ironical cake and yet eat it seriously. "Pan is dead," the curate Mr. Sandback pronounces in "The Story of a Panic," but the rest of Forster's tale proves him tragically mistaken: a certain sort of Englishman simply cannot see him. The narrator of "The Curate's Friend" explains: "There is nothing particularly classical about a faun: it is only that the Greeks and Italians have ever had the sharpest eyes" (Collected Tales 9, 113). In A Room with a View, the narrator seems to allow the presence of a merely impish Pan: "Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuc cessful picnics" (81). Myth, nevertheless, does inform Forster's conception of the novel. The narrator calls the driver of Lucy's carriage on the outing to Fiesole "Phaeton" and his girlfriend "Persephone"; in the film, Mr. Beebe does this label ing. For the narrator, the driver is both an ordinary young Italian working man and the solemn embodiment of the charioteer who gave the sun a memorable journey one day. In a manuscript draft, Forster had written: "The Italian boys are the cup bearers of the gods and the Italian youths are the gods themselves" (Lucy Ms GI). The driver is instinct with the knowledge of what must happen. Forster has Mr. Beebe say of the ordinary Italian working people: "they know what we want before we know it ourselves They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires" (39). This virtually divine gift of prophecy is evident when Lucy, sent off by the gossip ing Charlotte and Eleanor, asks Phaeton the whereabouts of the Reverends Beebe and Eager. She translates "clergymen" in her beginner's Italian as "buono uomini," but Phaeton knows that for this young woman there is only one good man among the company and directs her to George and, thus, to her future. The film emphasizes Phaeton's importance just before Lucy's question by filming him close up, alone, leaning back against the carriage seat, face upturned to the sun, smoking, engaged in a blissful revery. The shot is held, and Puccini's "Chi el Bel Sogno di Doretta" begins on the soundtrack. This image serves in good stead for a thought that occurs to George in the novel's final chapter as he leans out the pension window and sees a driver who "might well be that very Phaeton who had set this happiness in motion months ago" (242); but a single image, however potent, cannot quite carry the weight of Forster's opposition between the wisdom, natural and godlike, of the</page><page sequence="13">Film Adaptation 79 Mediterranean world and the undeveloped heart of the English. It is his narrator who must explain why "Phaeton had lost the game" when the English return hur riedly to Florence: He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late. (82) Ever since the murder in the Piazza, however, after which he had said, "I shall want to live," George has been gaining the understanding that Forster believes Italy can teach. During the Fiesole sequence, the script contains a scene that is not in the novel but that is, nonetheless, Forsterian. George climbs a spindly tree and calls out "Beauty. L'Espoir." The shot cuts to Reverend Beebe commenting drily, "Is that the silent, dour George?" Reverend Eager, who must find George's enthu siasm in exceedingly bad form, asks for another lump of sugar. When the camera returns to George, the tree is swaying dangerously and George falls from it out of the bottom of the frame. This is surely mock heroic, but the tone of deflation does not overwhelm the validity of the affirmation that George has chosen, with the help of Italy and the Italians: life over death-in-life. Lucy, as well, has been deeply affected by her experience in Italy. Forster's narrator says that it offered her "the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul" (128). Some of the narrator's views about the effects of the Italian experience are difficult to render in film, however, for example the hyperbolic passage about the statues in the Piazza: "Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before. Here, not in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god" (67). If, as I suspect, Forster is offering the gods and heroes as models for the mortals and casting Lucy and George in the roles of learners, the filmmakers' decision not to try to render the idea may have been determined by a sense of its excess. Other material revealing Forster's con struction of the Mediterranean view is omitted from the film with greater loss. On the outing, Reverend Eager translates Lorenzo's line "Non fate guerra al Magio" as "War not with the May" in rebuke of Mr. Emerson's colloquial version: "Don't go fighting against the Spring" (75). Italy has urged George and Lucy to join the Spring, to take the widest, deepest view of such a rite. Emerging from the opposing ideas of feudalism and the Mediterranean world, "a room with a view" becomes a metaphor for the personal viewpoint and is elab orated in both novel and film. The novel opens with disappointment expressed about a literal visual perspective. Charlotte and Lucy want the view that they had been promised when they reserved rooms at the Bertolini, a much advertised view that every dutiful tourist seeks. Mr. Emerson overhears them and insists that they take his and George's rooms. Much later, after the tennis game at Windy Corner,</page><page sequence="14">80 June Perry Levine George tells Lucy and Cecil that his father "says there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it." Cecil interjects, typically: "I suspect your father has been reading Dante." George ignores this pedantry and elaborates his father's idea that "views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason." Although Mr. Emerson is still con sidering actual views, his remarks are philosophical and stress the need for the individual to relate to the cosmos rather than to the social and scenic world around him/her. George agrees with his father: all views "are alike. Because all that matters in them is distance and air"; he never "noticefs] much difference in views" (184). The Emersons' concern with the self is in the tradition of Western thought, but the balancing of this idea with the power of the Universe reflects the influence of Eastern cosmology. It is not surprising that the Emersons are readers of Thoreau. The film, which by the nature of the medium renders every view photographic ally, opens, after establishing the Bertolini name on a brass door-plate, with a dark shot of closed shutters; when they are suddenly pushed open to the view below by someone yet unseen, a subjective point of view is clearly indicated. The reverse angle cut to a close-up of Lucy and Charlotte's faces and the ensuing dialogue reinforce the knowledge that it is their view we have seen and that they find it inadequate. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Emerson's added line at the pension dinner table—that his view is created from within himself—stresses the metaphorical nature of the conceit. Both film and novel have Lucy later telling Cecil, to his distress, that she always thinks of him as in a drawing room with no view at all. Cecil is a contained figure surrounded by the artifacts of civilization; the Emersons look within, yet are conscious of their isolation under the sky. Lucy is not sure until late in the novel what her view is. The metaphor of a room with a view is rich in meanings, not all of which are philosophical or psychological. The sociology of class distinction is a facet of its connotations. Lucy has a glimmer of this the first evening at the pension dinner table: "she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists [the Emersons] spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before" (6). And when Charlotte meets the Emersons again in Surrey, she bows stiffly and keeps her distance; the narrator comments: "It was the Pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. It was the old, old battle of the room with a view" (178). By repeating the word "old" Forster suggests that the battle is not only Charlotte's need to maintain her own view of social distinctions but the long-standing struggle of the English with the rigidity of class distinctions, of separate compartments. Lucy's view will entail the need to cross over: she will marry a working-class man whose own view is to "choose a place where you won't do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine" (176). The ending of the film places Lucy and George in the room with a view. They are beautifully framed by the Duomo on the left and the Companile on the right.</page><page sequence="15">Film Adaptation 81 Although the audience sees the view in the background, Lucy and George are totally engrossed in each other. Lucy's initial idea that the recording of Florence as a cultural artifact is more important than creating one's own view of experience has been supplanted by the Forsterian view that personal relations are paramount. This final scene is reinforced by the one just before it which does not occur in the novel. A young woman and her chaperone, a new Lucy and Charlotte, have been bicker ing at the Bertolini dinner table because they haven't been given rooms with a view. In the encounter, which rhymes with the opening sequence, Lucy, sitting across the table from them, says that one must have a view and George, sitting beside her, tells them: "We have a view." But neither of them offers to exchange it for the newcomers'. A mere switching of rooms will not provide the view that is needed. The presentation of material in cinema differs, of course, from that in the novel: dramatization, transition, elision and point of view are managed according to the possibilities of the two media. In keeping with the cinematic prescription of show ing, not telling, material alluded to in Forster's novel is dramatized in Ivory's film. Perhaps the film's most successful instance of this practice is the treatment of the Emersons' gift of violets to the Alan sisters. Forster refers to this incident two times, the first a mere hint in Florence. In a discussion of the Emersons, Mr. Beebe says: "I consider that you are bound to class [Mr. Emerson] as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets." Miss Alan replies: "Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get round? A pension is a sad place for gossips" (43). The matter, tantalizingly, stops there. Much later, in England, in the muddle over the renting of Cissie Villa, Mr. Beebe resumes the story with the Honeychurches: "There was a great scene over some violets. [The Emersons] picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so pleased They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with 'So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful' Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets" (132). So, of course, does Lucy. In the film, the Alan sisters' violets have mutated into cornflowers, but Forster's directions are followed closely, and developed, in bringing the description to life. The scene opens on a close-up of cornflowers; the camera pulls back to George Emerson and his father inexpertly arranging them in vases; the Alans enter and discover what is happening in their room. Mr. Emerson explains that the sisters had said they liked cornflowers and he thinks the flowers suit their personality. The father and son proceed to adorn the abashed and delighted sisters, sticking the "jewels" in their hair. The scene cuts to Lucy and Mr. Beebe talking in the parlor. The Alans enter wearing cornflower garlands and Mr. Beebe, amused, says: "Miss Alan, there are flowers in your hair." Miss Catherine goes to the mirror and a subjective point-of-view shot shows her incredulous gaze. This lovely, comic inter lude serves as a gloss to Mr. Emerson's belief that one mustn't "go fighting against the Spring." With very little dialogue, but with camera movement and varied imagery, Mr. Beebe's account has been actualized.</page><page sequence="16">82 June Perry Levine Another example of an incident referred to in the novel and fleshed out in the film concerns the word "stomach," not a locution acceptable in Edwardian polite society. Miss Alan can tell the story to Lucy in the novel only because Mr. Beebe has left the ladies: "That old Mr. Emerson.. .puts things very strangely... .Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach—acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter" (41). The film dramatizes the story during the first evening at the Bertolini dinner table when Mr. Emerson turns around and cautions Miss Pole against too much lemonade. The audience wit nesses the shocked disapproval of the refined diners. One further example among the many instances of film's penchant for enactment: when Freddy sings a music hall song, we hear the performance and see Cecil's disdain as he leaves the room; in the novel, Mrs. Honeychurch merely alludes to the contretemps. Unlike making scenes dramatic, effecting transitions can be a difficulty in adap tations because the temporal and causal explanations provided by the narrator must be otherwise negotiated. Ivory/Jhabvala resort three times to the use of letters read voice-over to achieve clear movement from one place and person to another. Lucy's letter from Windy Corner to the Alan sisters in London, telling them that Cissie Villa is for rent, starts with a shot of her writing and continues with a sound and image edit on her voice-over of the letter to a shot of the Alans reading it. Later, the letter from the Alans about their ensuing trip to Greece is handled in much the same way with Mr. Beebe as the recipient relaying its news to Windy Corner. The third instance is Charlotte's reading of Lucy's letter from Florence, which I have already discussed. The use of Forster's chapter headings serves, of course, as another sort of transitional device. This particular adaptation also shares with others the problem of omission. A medium-length novel cannot be presented in its entirety in a two-hour film. Many literary critics have faulted films for leaving out so much of the work being adapted, as if this were a problem inherent in the medium rather than the practice of film exhibition. Television has answered this difficulty by means of mini- and even maxi-series that may remind one of the serialization of nineteenth-century novels in periodicals. As some of my examples may have indicated, Jhabvala has been astute in excision and economical in presentation. Unlike David Lean's adaptation of A Passage to India, which savaged Mrs. Moore and Professor Godbole and the major themes associated with these characters, the only important loss in A Room with a View's judicious pruning is some aspects of Forster's ideas about feudalism and Mediterraneanism (Levine 144-47). Another problem all adaptations face is point of view: in film, the objective point of view is the typical position of the camera, whereas narrated novels usually offer a constantly voiced and, therefore, more subjective vantage point. The cine matic perspective of the first-person narrator is virtually impossible to sustain throughout the length of a film. Nevertheless, subjective shots from individual characters' points of view play an integral part of the film code and can, when done sensitively, even give the audience entry into a character's thoughts. Forster's A Room with a View presents a number of characters' subjective views through win</page><page sequence="17">Film Adaptation 83 dows and doors in keeping with the novel's dominant metaphor. The film retains this idea. The audience sees Mrs. Honeychurch's view of Lucy and Cecil dis cussing their engagement in the garden through the french doors of the drawing room, Mr. Emerson's view of a dejected George leaving Cissie Villa in the rain, and, from the long perspective of Lucy and George's confrontation in the house, Cecil in the garden battling a wasp and a teacup. Although not characterized by an emphasis on the subjective point of view, the film uses the intimacy of such shots, especially those through apertures, in combination with the prevailing omniscient perspective. The truism that literature and cinema are such different media that a novel cannot without impairment be translated into film appears to be unsound theoretically. As I have discussed, the most difficult problem of translation concerns tone in the novel, especially when its locus is the narrative voice. Discussing his recent film adaptation of his own novel Tough Guys Don't Dance, Norman Mailer is quoted by Karen Jaehne as saying: The merits of the novel depend upon a long, continuing inner voice of the narra tive, and there should be no off-screen narration in a movie. I made the decision in the beginning of this film that I was not going to have an off-screen narration, notwithstanding all the virtues of Sunset Boulevard Narration is inimical to film. A profound trap. I knew once I started it, 1 couldn't get out of it. So many marvelous sentences in the book had to be sacrificed, but I didn't want this narrator saying things that look marvelous on paper but would bog actors down acting them out and dictate to audiences what to make of the images. Getting rid of the inner voice immediately alters the value of the work, which is why it took me six months to recreate a novel that only took two months to write. (13) Ironically, Jaehne reports that Mailer "would later reach out for the lifeline of narration" in completing the film (13). Mailer, however, does raise a vital issue when he theorizes that narration "dictate[s] to audiences what to make of the images." Although over-explicitness can be a problem in novels as well, verbal commentary there can flow almost seamlessly into description and characters' point of view, whereas in film the disjunction between voice-over narration and visual images of the characters in settings is always marked. Nevertheless, Mailer's desire to give the audience leeway to inter pret—a sound attitude toward the reader as well as viewer—cannot in itself consti tute an argument against the narrative voice in film. Mailer apparently found that, despite his own strictures, he was unable to avoid a narrator. With the exception I have mentioned of the three letter-writing scenes, there is no voice-over in A Room with a View, and these particular scenes do not entail comment addressed to the audience, but, ostensibly, to the recipients of the letters. Yet film is capable of rendering direct address and, since it possesses this capability, there seems no acceptable basis for Mailer's dogmatic and absolute assertion that narration is "inimical" to film. The matter requires the filmmaker's decision on a case by case</page><page sequence="18">84 June Perry Levine basis. The list of highly praised adaptations employing narration is a long one. I do think that to avoid off-screen narration in adapting novels is to take the more diffi cult path, one requiring enormous ingenuity in commanding the syntax of the medium. Many recent films have, for example, employed tape recorders and cameras as elements of the plot, partly to provide surrogates for a narrator. Yet even a conventional adaptation such as A Room with a View reveals that a thorough understanding of an author, confidence in the quality of a work and analysis of its form, combined with a totalistic view of the preparation of the script and great skill in production and editing can, if not add anything of great conse quence to the novel, at least not falsify or diminish it. A Room with a View can be discussed as a film complete in itself, but it can also be analyzed for the light it reflects on the nature of and interaction between literature and film.
