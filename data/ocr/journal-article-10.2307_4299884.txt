<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA* By Ruben S. Badaljan, Christopher Edens, Ronald Gorny, Philip L. Kohl, David Stronach, Armen V. Tonikjan, Simone Hamayakjan, Sergei Mandrikjan and Mrktich Zardarjanl Yerevan, Harvard, Wellesley, Massachussetts, Chicago and Berkeley, California Joint American/Armenian archaeological investi- gations in northwestern Armenia began in the sum- mer of 1990 when a small test trench or sounding was excavated at the large prehistoric site of Horom which is located c. 15 km. southeast of Gumairi, for- merly Leninakan (Badaljan et. al. 1992). This work demonstrated that the site was extensively occupied during the Early Iron Age (late second to early first millennium B.C.) and during the beginnings of the Early Bronze period (second half of the fourth mil- lennium B.C.). Survey work had also shown that there was no comparable prehistoric site either on the Djavakheti plateau of southern Georgia or else- where on the Shirak plain of northwestern Armenia. The preliminary investigations demonstrated that systematic excavations at Horom are necessary to elucidate this regional centre. This work began in the 1992 summer season, when a team of eighteen scholars and students from America joined Armenian specialists from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences in Yerevan.2 This progress report summar- ises the results of the 1992 season. PALAEOLITHIC INVESTIGATIONS Besides the excavations at Horom, a reconnais- sance investigation of Palaeolithic materials from southern Georgia was carried out by Ms. Barbara Isaac, the Assistant Director, Peabody Museum, Harvard University as part of the regionally focused IPARC project (International Program for Anthropological Research in the Caucasus).3 While Palaeolithic materials have been collected on the surface of the Horom site (Badaljan, et al. 1992:35), remains of this period were not investigated in Armenia during the 1992 season. The 1992 recon- naissance of Palaeolithic remains in southern Georgia included visits to the important Lower Palaeolithic site of Dmanisi4 in Lower Kartli where discoveries in 1991 of pebble "Oldowan" tools and a hominid mandible (H. erectus, possibly with features from H. ergaster, F. Clark Howell, pers. comm.) in situ pushed back known hominid occupation in the area well beyond the late Acheulean, possibly as early as 1.5 million years ago (as based on a single K-Ar date beneath the mandible of 1.8 mya) (Djaparidze, et al. 1989). The 1992 reconnaissance focused primarily on Lower Palaeolithic materials near Akhalkalaki on the Djavakheti plateau and on the smaller Persati plateau farther to the northwest. Lake, alluvial, and aeolian sediments on these high plateaux, which are interstratifed with Mio-Pliocene and Plio-Pleistocene lavas potentially datable by potassium-argon, contain fauna of comparable, or slightly younger, age to that of Dmanisi (Vekua 1987). In particular, the Akhalkalaki area, where lake beds are sandwiched between two lava flows, produced one in situ and two surface pebble arte- facts and will be more intensively investigated in 1993. The Middle and Upper Palaeolithic cave sites of Tsopi, Ortvala Klde, Samgle Klde, and Dzudzuana also were examined and may be investigated more intensively in future seasons. HOROM EXCAVATIONS The prehistoric settlement at Horom sits on the northwestern end of a 400 ha. zone of rocky hills. Extensive areas of scattered burials surround the settlement to the south and east. The settlement itself covers some 45-50 ha., and is marked by mas- sive standing stone architecture and a dense surface scatter of artifacts. The settlement centres on two prominent hills, termed the North and South Hills, each of which is capped with a complex fortification * The authors would like to dedicate this article to Dr. Gevork Tiratsjan, Director of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of Armenia, who died unexpectedly in Yerevan shortly after this article was submitted for publication. Dr. Tiratsjan was a superb scholar and a wonderful man who strongly supported our collaborative American-Armenian research project. Without his assistance, the excavations report- ed here would not have taken place. We thank him and greatly regret his passing. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES .- ... ..' j 7 _ 7/Illp~ ?flO-fllY~m S12- \77 // '7?

Sketch plan of the Northern Citadel showing the approximate location of the main walls and the excavation operations in Areas B to E. system. The fortification system orn the northern citadel hill presents a four-nested system of fortifica- tion walls, each of which defines a compound. These distinguishable units, which seems to repre- sent a sequential expansion of the citadel area, are labelled A-D (from the summit down, see Fig. 1); the whole of the walled area covers 3.6 ha. The South Hill is more compact, and many features of its fortifications are obscured by slope wash and rock tumble. The initial report suggested that the north- ern citadel belonged primarily to the Early Iron Age, and the southern citadel to a different earlier period, possibly extending even back to the Late Bronze Age. Elsewhere on the site, prehistoric settle- ment is marked only by surface scatters of artifacts The datable sherd scatters indicated that the extra- mural parts of the site date principally to the Early Bronze and Early Iron Ages. A small sounding undertaken within the C Fortification Wall in 1990 indicated that Early Bronze Age habitation also existed on the northern citadel hill (Badaljan, et al. 1992). The 1992 excavations at Horom focused on the North and South Hills. Nine different operations on the northern citadel hill examined different aspects of this part of the site. These operations each focused on establishing the chronologies of the for- tification systems, ascertaining the nature of deposits adjacent to these walls, and beginning to assemble the information needed to understand Horom's settlement history. The nine operations included the following (approximate locations shown in Fig. 1). A1-A small exposure at the summit of the hill, which is capped principally by medieval architec- ture. B1--An extensive exposure around the North West Gate, in the B Fortification Wall. The opera- tion is divided into three parts: Bla, which exposed the outer face of the fortification wall just outside the gate itself; Blb, which exposed an additional sec- tion of the outer wall face; and B1c, which opened an area inside the wall, immediately southeast of the gate. These excavations produced both Early Iron Age pottery in the local tradition and Urartian ceramics, as well as iron and bronze metalwork that seems also to have Urartian affinities. B2-A 9.5 x 6.5 m. exposure against the inner</page><page sequence="3">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 3 face of the B Fortification Wall on its eastern side. The operation exposed several well-built walls and a corridor-shaped room, dated by the associated Early Iron Age and Urartian pottery. C1-A 6 x 10 m. exposure against the outer face of the B Wall, opposite the B2 operation. The C1 operation uncovered a fill sequence, the sherds of which were mostly Early Bronze Kura-Araxes culture type mixed with Early Iron wares, against the B Fortification Wall. The operation also provided evi- dence for the construction of the B Wall, and exposed a stone chambered tomb of Early Bronze Age date. C2-An 8 x 8 m. exposure near the centre of the C Fortification Terrace, to the east of the B2 and C1 operations. The C2 operation uncovered an exten- sive plastered pavement and associated walling; the pottery from the area again juxtaposes local Early Iron Age with Urartian wares. C3-Two 5 x 5 m. exposures, C3a and C3b, one on each side of the 1990 trench, just inside and west of the gate on the southern side of the C Forti- fication Wall. This operation revealed sequences of Early Iron Age fill, informal surfaces, and archi- tecture; the EBA levels were not reached. C4-A 4 x 5 m. exposure against the C Forti- fication Wall, immediately east of the southern gate. The operation encountered ephemeral EBA occu- pation beneath a thin fill, and revealed the base of the C Fortification Wall in this area to be very shal- low. D1-A large exposure in the southern, less heavily fortified section of the North Hill. The exca- vations here unearthed a series of rooms and fea- tures; as in many other operations on the North Hill, the pottery is a mix of local Early Iron Age and Urartian styles. El-An irregular exposure (approximately 4 x 6 m.) against the the C Fortification Wall and immediately east of the southern gate, opposite the C4 operation. The operation exposed stone walls that run beneath the C Wall; the pottery connected with this extramural architecture is mixed in date, but included a broken Middle Bronze Age vessel (P1. Ib). On the South Hill, excavations concentrated on two distinct areas, with basic questions comparable to those asked of the northern citadel hill. The first operation, designated M1/6, exposed 10 x 17 m. of an architectural complex on the western end of the hill's summit. This architecture, perhaps ritual in nature, contains a uniformly Early Iron Age pottery assemblage, the characteristics of which suggest an early phase of this period (possibly late second mil- lennium B.C.) The second operation, M3/4, was a 2 x 22 m. step trench in the middle of the hill down its northern slope. The operation exposed several units of walling and a fill sequence; as in M1/6, the pottery in this operation was entirely Early Iron Age in date. Excavation also occurred in two areas away from the two citadel hills. One of these was a small (2.5 x 5 m.) sounding, Operation H1, on flat ground west of the North Hill and well beyond its system of fortifications. This excavation exposed a sequence of slope wash covering a sequence of Iron Age and Early Bronze Age architecture, as well as what may be a medieval cistern. The second area of excavation was in a tomb group more than half a kilometer southeast of the North and South Hills. Excavation opened two of these tombs, which con- tained multiple burials, Early Iron Age pottery in the local style, and other grave goods. The remainder of this report presents the salient results of these excavations in their chronological order Kura-Araxes (Early Transcaucasian) Culture Bronze Age The 1990 sounding and survey at Horom docu- mented the presence of a major Early Bronze Age occupation at Horom that was overlain by later mas- sive Iron Age deposits. One radiocarbon sample from the base of the 1990 sounding from a level associated with Early Bronze materials yielded a cor- rected determination of 3371-3136 B.C. (date no. AA-7767 at 1 sigma; or 3502-3046 B.C. at 2 sigma) suggesting that the initial occupation at Horom should be dated to the beginnings of the Early Bronze period in the latter half of the fourth millen- nium B.C. Early Bronze ceramics were encountered in mixed levels of the operations on the North Hill, except for the limited sounding on the summit of this hill (Trench Al) where they were not encoun- tered. They also were not recovered from the exten- sive excavations on the summit of the south Hill, suggesting that this hill was not occupied during the Early Bronze period. One small sounding to the west, southwest of the northern hill beyond the forti- fication walls (operation H1) revealed the presence of a c. 1.3 m. thick Early Bronze deposit overlain by more substantial Early Iron remains and erosional levels, replicating essentially the results of the 1990 sounding. In Operation C4 immediately to the east of the southern gate in the C Wall (termed gate 6 in Badaljan et al. 1992: 36, 44) and abutting the C Fortification Wall, only shallow Early Bronze remains were found lying directly on bedrock, despite the proximity of this operation to the much thicker EBA deposits found in tile 1990 sounding. Trench C1, a 4 m. wide trench exposing 2 but- tresses and corresponding section of the exterior facade of the second or B Fortification Wall (a c. 7 m. long section of the wall, see Figs. 1 and 15),</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES was excavated to a depth of more than 2 m. and con- tained primarily Early Bronze ceramics. Occasional Early Iron sherds were found mixed together with these Kura-Araxes burnished grey wares above a thick, well-defined yellowish-brown clay surface that ran throughout the trench and on which the B Fortification Wall was built. The evidence sug- gested that a substantial Early Bronze occupation had been disturbed here during the subsequent building of the Iron Age fortification wall. A deep sounding in this trench, placed 50 cm. east of the B Fortification Wall and dug beneath this well-defined surface, was set directly above the chamber of a collective Early Bronze tomb (P1. Ia), which contained the remains of at least three indi- viduals,5 three complete early Kura-Araxes culture vessels, and more than fifty tiny, flat circular clay beads. This collective tomb was constructed of stones, primarily volcanic tuff, that rose to a height of c. 80 cm. and had a red tuff floor covered by a c. 3 cm. thick deposit of burnt earth; the large cap- stone covering the chamber (156 x 70 cm., c. 20 cm. thick) collapsed into the chamber during the excavations of the sounding. The tomb formed a quadrilateral, oriented northwest to southeast (123 cm.-northern, 135 cm.-southern, and 120 cm. long on its eastern and western sides). A dromos or entry passage was set back on the eastern side of the tomb and covered by a large stone, extending across most of the eastern side; the entrance was also blocked by a stone and two stones on the floor of this dromos functioned as a threshold into the chamber. Intriguingly, two par- tially worked, semi-anthropomorphic stones (or "idols") had been secondarily set into the side walls of the chamber in the northeastern and southeast- ern corners on either side of the entrance. The bones, which were partially burnt, were scattered as if pushed back along the southern, western, and northern sides of the chamber away from the dromos, while two skulls, set face down, and an isolated mandible also were distributed in this scatter. One of the vessels was found near one of the skulls in the southeastern corner of the tomb and two others were found near the mandible in the northeastern corner. Burnt bones of what appeared to be a single individual were collected for radiocarbon analysis. This accidental discovery, which came on the last day of the excavations in trench C1, raises many questions for further research. The tomb, which was definitely built beneath the carefully laid level on which the B Fortification Wall was constructed, may not prove an isolated construc- tion, but one of many defining an early Early Bronze cemetery on the relatively flat third terrace of the eastern slope of the northern hill. Such a determi- nation, which must await next season, could help us define or, at least, understand more clearly the scale of the earliest substantial occupation at Horom in the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. Middle and Late Bronze Remains from Horom The occupation of Horom during the subsequent Middle and Late Bronze periods or throughout most of the second millennium B.C. remains elu- sive, though certain evidence suggests that the site probably was not totally abandoned during these periods. A second radiocarbon date from the 1990 sounding, associated with the "Early Iron" cyclopean stone wall that cut diagonally across the trench (Badaljan et al. 1992: 36-7, pl. XIIa), yielded an unexpectedly high corrected date of 1887-1693 B.C. (date no. AA-7766 at 1 sigma; or 1970-1630 B.C. at 2 sigma), and the small excavation El (see Fig. 1) placed against the C Fortification Wall opposite Trench C4 and immediately to the east of gate 6 and the 1990 sounding uncovered two stone walls, run- ning parallel to each other, one of which (wall 2, Fig. 2) continued at a diagonal beneath the C Fortification Wall. Several sherds of a large painted black-on-red Middle Bronze vessel (P1. Ib) were found in a level containing a mixture of Early Bronze and Early Iron Age pottery, c. 1 m. beneath the surface near the southern face of wall 2 or between these two parallel walls. Individual sherds also appeared in an otherwise Early Iron Age con- text in the C3a operation within the C Fortification Wall. Continuation of work in El and possibly west of this southern gate on either side of the C Fortification Wall (including the area of the 1990 sounding and Operation C3 (Fig. 1) in 1992) should elucidate the possible presence of an early second millennium occupation in this area of the northern hill. Early "Early Iron " Materials from Horom: the Evidence from the South Hill The southern hill of Horom, which rises to a height of 1673 m.a.s.l. or just two metres lower than the height of the northern hill, can be divided into three areas: the eastern flank which comprises the highest part of the mound; the western flank which overlooks the contemporary village and the main north-south road traversing the Shirak plain; and a central saddle that is dominated by the main gate- way through the massive stone fortifications that encircle the southern summit and slope of the hill (see Badaljan et al. 1992: 42, Fig. 8). Since surveys had suggested that the southern hill was occupied principally, if not exclusively, during the pre- Urartian "Early Iron" period, two separate areas on the eastern summit (operation M1) and down the</page><page sequence="5">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 5 HOROM 1992 AREA El i -i 1650.17 (j 1649.73 1649.60 Fig. 2.

The south face of the C Fortification Wall (indicated at the top of the plan beneath directional arrow) runs over the northwest end of Wall 2. northern slope of the lower western flank (M3/4) were opened in 1992 in order to confirm this hypothesis. While visible architectural features on the eastern summit suggested the utility of a broad horizontal exposure, it was decided that opening a step trench down the northern slope of the western flank might reveal successive stages of occupation of the hill over time. Operation M1/6: the horizontal exposure Area M1/6 began as a 2 x 2 m. test pit that expanded ultimately into a 10 x 17 m. trench. "Early Iron" paving stones were found c. 75 cm. beneath the surface, and cultural deposits continued for another 50 cm. before hitting bedrock. Two stone structures resembled late cist graves, although no mortuary evidence was found inside them; part of a human skull recovered immediately to the west of one of them (Feature 1) supported the idea that they were graves which had most probably been robbed of their contents. The excavations revealed a complex with four dis- tinct areas (Fig. 3). The first is paved with large stones and appears to be a central courtyard. South of the courtyard is a raised dais approached by what seem to be two steps. Two stone-cut pits (or "basins") were found in the southeast corner of the dais, this whole feature being oriented to the snow- capped peaks of Mt. Aragats (13,412 ft.) which rise majestically to the southeast. From the central court- yard one can proceed west through an entry or doorway to a slightly lower paved area or street. West of the dais and south of the street is a fourth area set off from the lower paving by a small east-west wall. This room also has access to the dais by means of three steps, at the top of which is a short path lead- ing to two stone-cut pits or "basins" (Fig. 3, Pls. Ic, d). A step or a niche is found between these pits, but because excavations stopped at this point, it is difficult to say whether this pathway continued or whether the pits constituted the primary focus of whatever activity took place in the area. Several other interesting features were also found. Besides a second pair of stone-cut pits (facing southwest), a larger stone-lined pit and associated ring of stone which had been chiselled out of an adjacent rock through which a rope could have been attached (a so-called "tethering ring") were discovered at the base of the staircase leading to the dais, and a square basin constructed of rocks with three associ- ated "tethering rings" was found within the western extremity of the excavated area. The stone-cut pits, which typically are hollowed out to a depth of 50-70 cm. and are c. 35-45 cm. wide, and the associ- ated "tethering rings", such as those on the dais, appear to be a common feature on the top of the southern hill with more than twenty of each already documented (P1. le). No evidence of roofing or of timber construction appeared in the horizontal exposure, which would suggest the presence of an open-air forum. Cultural remains were relatively scarce, and there is little to suggest an everday utilitarian function for this com- plex. The small amounts of recovered pottery were usually of fine quality, though larger fragments of several coarse storage vessels also were unearthed. Small quantities of chipped stone, ground stone, and worked bone also were found. Botanical remains included millet and rye, in addition to wheat and barley, while the faunal assemblage included sheep, goat, cow, and deer.6 It may be noteworthy that a relatively large percentage of cow bones was found in M1/6. A test pit sunk into the northeast corner of the trench on the last day of the season revealed a small exposure of bedrock that had been levelled with a thick deposit of hard packed gold-coloured soil. The massive stone construction found through- out this area indicated that major efforts had been</page><page sequence="6">6 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES M6 MI 0 LlDHOROM 1992 0 d 1 AREAM C DTRENCH MI/M6 0 in 1 z 2Mz DOD UN X ATFIRE PITM6 C ~ 0 BASIN CU) UNEXCAVATED M6 MI Fig. 3.

Indeed, the huge fortification blocks and the still visible wall foundations provide this prominence with a sense of monumentality. Based on this impressive appearance, the location at the highest point on the hill directly overlooking the spectacular peaks of Mt. Aragats, the general absence of everday, utilitarian goods, and, above all, the numerous stone-cut pits and associated "tether- ing rings"-all suggest some non-utilitarian, cultic or religious function for this site, possibly associated with animal sacrifice for necromancy and/or propi- tiations to a storm god (for an elaboration of this idea, see Gorny n.d.). Operation M3/4: the step-trench Since a prior survey had identified Early Bronze Age sherds along the northern base of the southern hill, it appeared possible that earlier occupation levels might be hidden beneath the extensive "Early Iron" remains. Consequently, a 2 m. wide trench, extending south to north for 22 m., was established in 2 m. increments down the northern slope of the hill near its western end, in order to investigate this sequence and in order to look for any fortifications that might have protected the hill on its northern side. The southern 10 m. of the trench was desig- nated M3, while the northern extension was termed M4. Immediately after opening excavations in M3, the foundations of a wall (Wall 1) were encountered running east-west across the trench, possibly repre- senting an extension of the fortifications visible along the crest of the hill farther to the east. Subsequent excavations in the southwest corner of the trench uncovered a stone niche or installation encasing a bovine skull set on a plaster floor. Another installation, constructed of three vertically set red tuff stones, possibly representing a fireplace, was located farther north beyond a small crosswall, running diagonally across the trench. The plastered floor on which the fireplace was set continued north for c. 1 m. and then was cut by another large wall (Wall 2). The plaster floor in M3 actually consisted of a series of at least twelve surfaces laid immediately over one another. An intermediate level of gray fill, which in turn lay on top of an earlier series of simi- larly plastered floors, lay directly beneath this first series of surfaces. The pottery remained consistent throughout, an apparent indication that there were two subphases of the same period in this area. Bedrock appeared approximately 1.5 m. below the surface. Farther north of Walls 1 and 2, the nature of the deposits changed dramatically. A thick series of lenses, containing large quantities of cultural debris,</page><page sequence="7">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 7 particularly animal bones, created a 3.4 m. fill that was deposited over a series of packed surfaces with a stone foundation. Apparently, the natural bedrock dropped precipitously off at this point where this thick cultural deposit had accumulated, either as the product of a deliberate filling operation or, more likely, as a midden or dump. Farther north, the lenses sloped sharply down hill where they over- lay a 5-6 m. thick man-made structure that may be the foundation of an early fortification wall. Finally, another east-west wall was discovered at the north- ern end of M4; this was initially also thought to be part of the fortification system, but it more likely represents the extension of a terrace retaining wall, which is also visible along the slope of the hill farther to the east. The section shows that the sloping lenses were cut by the construction of the retaining wall, and this wall may have been contem- porary with the original Wall 1 in the upper portion of M3 to the south. The large stone construction at the base of M4 may be somewhat earlier. Since the pottery from the trench remains homogeneous throughout, a similar picture of two sub-phases with- in a single period again emerges. Bedrock was reached just below the massive stone construction in M4. The absolute date of the constructions on the South Hill is, for the moment, unclear; unfortu- nately, carbon samples for C14 analysis were not found during these excavations. The grey wares (Figs. 4-6) from the M1 and M3/4 operations could be distinguished from those recovered on the North Hill, particularly those associated with well-fired red wares of indisputable Urartian affinity and the final cyclopean fortifications as documented in the B1, B2, and C2 operations (see below). No diagnostic Urartian ceramics were found in the M excavations, and certain features of the ceramic assemblage (vessels with sharply everted rims, carinated bowls, spouted forms, and several fragments with pattern burnished designs) seem earlier "Early Iron", if not Late Bronze; they are more reminiscent of vessels excavated in tombs east of the settlement. In other words, there is reason to postulate that the principal occupation of the southern hill may predate the advent of the Urartians and date more towards the Fig. 4.

Additional excavations on the southern hill are needed to confirm this idea and to understand the more primitive, though still massive, stone fortifications visible particularly on the south- ern slope of this hill. Tombs East of the Settlement During the second half of the summer two crom- lech-shaped tombs, consisting of a central burial pit within a ring of stones, were opened c. 600 m. to the east, southeast of the South Hill. Clusters of such cromlechs are scattered across several hundred hectares to the south and east of the settlement proper with a particularly dense concentration or cemetery located over a kilometer south of the southern hill. The two cromlechs (Figs. 7-8) chosen for excavation were situated adjacent to each other in relative proximity to the other areas of excavation and were accessible to earth-moving equipment essential for the raising of the massive capstones that Fig. 5.

They also were roughly midway between the settlement and the 160 Early Iron tombs excavated from 1987-9 as salvage work associ- ated with the construction of the Nor Kyank reser- voir on the easternmost periphery of the Horom site (Badaljan and Agekjan 1991). The first tomb (TI), which was oval in shape (5.5 m. x 4.3 m.), contained a central burial pit with a skeleton lying flexed on its left side, its head pointed to the southwest, and a subsidiary extension to the southeast which contained only two frag- ments of possibly human bone (Fig. 7). The soil matrix was an extremely hard light brown/yellowish clayey soil, while the burial fill was darker and loos- er. The vessels found on the outer edges of the bur- ial pits were partly surrounded by this hard clay, making their excavation a very laborious and slow process. Three grey ware vessels were found with the skeleton, and hundreds of variously shaped beads made of bronze, paste, blue glass (?), shell, and car- nelian were scattered throughout this burial.

These include: four bronze discs (one found near the skull, three near the legs); two bronze buttons; five bronze rings found in a row beneath a leg bone; two bronze bracelets around an arm; and two bronze hair clasps one of which lay beneath and one of which lay on the skull, each with a wavy metal band stretching from one end to the other (Fig. 9, 8). The secondary southeastern pit, possibly a cenotaph, contained six jars. The second cromlech (T2) was larger (nearly 8 m. in diameter) and consisted of three concentric rings of stones with a massive central capstone (Fig. 8). The pattern formed by the stone rings raised the possibility that this cromlech, like Tomb 1, may have contained more than one burial pit, though lack of time prevented us from determining whether or not this were the case. One partial skele- ton lacking its skull lay in an upper level of the cen- tral burial pit with three complete vessels, two bronze rings, a bronze needle, and scores of shell and frit beads. It was difficult to determine how this partially preserved burial was oriented, though it appeared to lie on a northwest to southeast axis with its head to the northwest. Beneath this skeleton lay two more individuals, possibly interred simultane- ously, with an additional seven vessels. Nothing diagnostically Urartian was found in these tombs (for a selection of the pottery, see Fig. 10), and it is thought that they, like the others earlier excavated farther to the east at Horom, date to the earlier, pre-Urartian Iron (or even Late Bronze?) Age settlement at the site. Several more tombs from separate clusters of cromlechs will be excavated next season in the hopes of detecting dif- ferences in the accompanying burial goods reflec- tive of the deceased's social rank and/or date. Early Iron/Urartian Periods: The Northern Citadel Hill Operation BI: The North-West Gate The selection of the Bi area for excavation was based on the almost instantly intelligible nature of certain of its main features. From a surface inspec- tion alone, it was clear that this sector of the B Fortification Wall included both the axis of the North-West Gate and the well-preserved stone socle of a tower located on the west side of the gate. Work began outside the north face of the West Tower in Trench Bla (Fig. 11) where, at depths of from 20-50 cm. below the surface, the outlines of several medium-sized, relatively flat-topped stones (Feature 1) immediately began to appear. The stones do not bond in any way with the heavier stonework of the tower and, while the investigation of this phenomenon is still not complete, it is very possible that we are dealing with a kind of rough, secondary revetment (P1. IIa), such as might have been installed in order to frustrate any attempt to undermine the base of the tower. The stones of Feature 1 are nowhere more than 1 m. in width, and they are flanked to the north by a smooth, partly burnt surface (absolute height c. 1644.40 m.) which eventually slopes up towards the entrance to the gate. An almost complete human skeleton was found lying face down on this hard surface with its head pointed towards the east. The interpretation of this latter discovery must nec- essarily depend, in part, on a forthcoming detailed study of the skeletal remains. For the moment, it may be noted that the skeleton appears to lie directly on an ancient surface, that it was not associ- ated with any grave goods, that most of the feet were missing or lay beneath the scapula (!), and that the extended, face-down position, with the left arm sharply bent under the chest and the right arm less sharply bent under the pelvis, is very much at odds with what would be expected in any interment of a ceremonial nature. Before any deeper excavations could be attempted, it proved necessary to take account of</page><page sequence="13">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 13 Fig. 10. Selected pottery from Tombs 1 and 2. Early Iron Age. Scale 1:4 the considerable internal pressures which had already partly displaced the upper courses of the outer face of the west tower (and which had already given the whole north face of the tower a distinct outward lean). In this context we decided, in the end, not to try to follow the stones of Feature 1 to their full extent to the west, but rather to leave a solid, unexcavated baulk, 1.20 m. in width, directly opposite the north-west corner of the West Tower. Then, with the relative assurance provided by this natural buttress, a second operation, Trench Bib (Fig. 11), was opened on the west side of the baulk at a point where the west side of the West Tower could be seen to run back to the main line of the B Fortification Wall. Here there was no longer any sign of a protective "revetment", and, within the limits of a small 1.5 m. wide sounding, it seemed feasible to try to expose the full height of the surviving cyclopean masonry. Similar to the exposed segment of the B Forti- fication Wall in the C1 operation (see below), the total height of the stone socle of the B Fortification Wall, as far as could be safely determined, proved to be just over 4 m. We were able to count here, how- ever, a total of six stone courses, as opposed to the five revealed in C1. At the same time, the west sec- tion of this deep probe revealed an unexpected and intriguing detail: viz., traces of a substantial, sloping layer of mud-brick collapse. Such was the interest of this feature, which affirmed the assumption that the</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES HOROM 1992 AREA BI TRENCHES A,B AND C 0 1 2M -"I'I - 1646.01 C 164A,12 1646.53 Fig. 11. Plan of the North-West Gate and Tower Complex in Area BI. cyclopean defensive walls of Horom were originally topped by a mudbrick superstructure, that the Bib trench was duly expanded for a further metre to the west in order to expose the upper surface of this layer of toppled brickwork (P1. IIb). Unfortunately, however, the bricks in the exposed area proved to be too fragmentary to provide any intact brick sizes. A third operation, Trench Bic, was subsequently opened on the inner face of the West Tower in order to examine the entire plan of Gate 2. Here we came down upon a small rectangular room (Room 1), 4.0 m. long x 2.5 m. wide, with a single narrow doorway on the east side, which had clearly been built up against the pre-existing tower (Fig. 11 and P1. IIc ). Even allowing for this circumstance, the side walls of Room 1 proved to be curiously unalike in character. Thus, while Walls 1 and 2 were composed of relatively small stones that still rose to a height of almost 2 m. near the south-west corner of the room , the squat socle of Wall 3, on the east edge of the room, was obviously intended to support a tall mud-brick superstructure. With a single doorway opening directly onto the adjacent roadway of North-West Gate, Room 1 would appear to have been constructed (albeit as an afterthought) as a guardroom for those who were responsible for controlling ingress and egress through the gateway. Late in the life of the room, however, a pit (Feature 7), with an east-west diameter of 2.5 m., came to take up most of the available floor space (Fig. 11). While it transpires that the pottery from the top- soil in B1c included several medieval sherds (pre- sumably washed down from the nearby summit of the north citadel hill), the sherdage from the floor of Room 1, and from the burnt surface of the adja- cent roadway (P1. IId ) consisted of local Early Iron Age wares in clear association with bowl sherds of an Urartian type (Fig. 12). Moreover, a deep sounding that was introduced within Room 1 in order to determine the local depth of bedrock (which was not reached) was still partly characterised by sherds of an Urartian type at a point nearly 1.8 m. below the floor of the room. The east side of North-West Gate is not as well preserved as the west side (Fig. 11 ). Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="15">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 15 the main lines of the plan can be made out, and they can be seen to provide a series of similar details. Among other things, it is evident that the north face of the east tower stood in line with the north face of the west tower and that this eastern bastion is also likely to have been supplied with an unbonded stone "revetment" at ground level. More interesting still, it is possible to distinguish a distinct rebate on each outer side of the entrance-a form of 'jog" which also finds a complement on each inner side of the entrance. The narrowest portion of the gate has a width of barely 1.5 m. (P1. IId) and a depth of 2.5 m. No door sockets have been identified in this vicinity to-date, but the burnt, ashy, and bricky debris that covered much of the bed of the entranceway was found to contain two separate, carbonised beam fragments. It is logical to suppose that these and other timbers once formed part of a flat ceiling that roofed the narrowest point between the two stone towers and that this same wooden framework served to support the central superstructure of the gate prior to its fiery destruction. The debris on the roadway also proved to contain a complete, two-handled dark grey ware jar, a collection of iron sickles and other implements, and a fragment of what appears to be a bronze quiver. All of these last finds, together with the remains of a well-constructed stone-covered drain extending down the central axis of the gate- way (visible in P1. IIe), were found at the very end of the excavations and have been reserved for more detailed examination in the coming 1993 season. Finally, note may be taken of Wall 5, a further unequivocal example of secondary stone construc- tion inside the line of the B Fortification Wall; as a guess, this could be part of the west wall of a second small "guardroom", which either complemented Room 1 from the first or served as a substitute for the latter room after the introduction of Feature 7. In sum, present evidence would seem to suggest that the North West Gate was built at a time when the long established local Iron Age pottery was already complemented by pottery with definite Urartian connections. Such a finding points to a foundation date within the eighth/seventh cen- turies B.C., and most especially to a moment either within or after the reign of Argishti I (c. 785-760 B.C.), since it was this energetic son of Menua who chose to record his local, northern conquests in rock-cut inscriptions at nearby Marmashen (in the Akhurjan valley northwest of Gumairi) and at the foot of Mt. Aragats (Konig 1955-7, nos. 87, 88). As to the date of the destruction of the North West Gate and the fall of the eighth/seventh century B.C. settlement at Horom, such an event is most likely to have coincided with the collapse of the Urartian Kingdom in or near 600 B.C., at a time when the many redoubtable fortresses of the region must have at last looked vulnerable. Operations B2 and Cl: The B Fortification Wall Trench B2, set against the inner face of the B Fortification Wall, was undertaken in conjunction with Trench C1, which was opened opposite B2 on the other side of the fortification wall, in an area where the B Wall appeared well-preserved and where the area on either side of the wall seemed relatively free of fall, promising rich, undisturbed cultural deposits. These trenches were meant to elu- cidate the date and development of the cyclopean B fortifications and to reveal the architecture associ- ated with it. Both trenches were initially laid out on a N-S axis: B2 was triangularly-shaped, stretching 7.5 m. along the inner face of the B Wall and extending 4.45 m. west from the wall and 6.1 m. to the north; Cl formed an irregular c. 2 x 3 m. rectan- gle with its longest sides running N-S and its north- ern bulk shaped by the conjunction of the fortifica- tion wall and one of its projecting buttresses. During the course of the summer, Trench B2 expanded 6 m. farther west and 2 m. farther north to expose more of the architecture abutting the inner face of the B Fortification Wall (Fig. 13), and C1 was extended 4 m. east of the exterior face of the B wall and stretched 10 m. along its face to expose nearly all of the northern buttress and part of a second but- tress projecting to the south (Fig. 15). A c. 75 cm. wide stone wall (Wall 3 in Fig. 13), which was set against and parallel to the B Fortification Wall (Wall 1), was discovered in the ini- tial B2 trench; this wall intersected a second wall (Wall 2/5 in Fig. 13), 110-115 cm. wide, extending to the northwest that continued directly into the for- tification wall on its southeastern side. As Trench B2 was enlarged, this wall was traced for nearly 9 m. until it met another wall or possible doorway (Wall 16) disappearing into the west section of the trench. Another wall (Wall 4) was discovered, c. 2 m. to the south of Wall 2/5, which ran roughly parallel to it from the western balk for more than 3.5 m. before turning or jogging 75 cm. farther south and then continuing again roughly parallel to Wall 2/5 until it ran into the B Fortification Wall; the south- ern face of Wall 4 was not excavated, and, thus, the purpose of this '"jog" or turn in the wall is unclear, though it may have functioned to strengthen or sup- port an extension farther to the west. A corridor or magazine-shaped room (P1. IIIa, b, and c), thus, was delimited, therefore, by Walls 1, 2/5, and 4; it appears to have been entered from the west beyond Wall 16 and the limits of the 1992 excavations. The interior faces of all these walls, including the fortifi- cation wall within this room, were thickly plastered with successive coats of clay (visible on Wall 16 in</page><page sequence="16">16 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Fig. 12.

At the end of the excavations, a deep sounding, placed within this room against Walls 1, 2/5, and 4, and to the southeast of the 'jog" in Wall 4, showed that all these walls were built on the same thickly plastered floor and that Wall 4 was pre- served to a height of slightly more than 3 m. at its junction with Wall 1; this floor was not cleared northwest of the "jog" in Wall 4. The northern (exterior ?) face of Wall 2/5 was not plastered, nor as well preserved as its southern face, and a later wall (Wall 12), which was built on a thick burnt surface that extended throughout the northern half of the trench (north of Wall 2/5), met Wall 2/5 near the northwestern corner of the trench, possibly forming a small room or alcove that formed an addition to the already existing architecture (see Fig. 13).

Iron Age architecture against inner face of the B Fortification Wall (labelled Wall 1 here). wares were encountered throughout the levels of this architectural complex, but they never consti- tuted the dominant ceramic. More abundant were wheel-thrown grey wares, some with horn-shaped and twisted handles, that appeared more continu- ous with the earlier Early Iron Age ceramics found throughout the site. Part of an iron spearhead and several iron nodules, including a large chunk of slag (10.4 x 10 x 6 cm.), were found in the fill of the corridor-shaped room; more nodules also were encountered north of Wall 2/5. A 14.8 cm. long bro- ken iron fragment with a curved blade (probably part of a weapon) and a heavily corroded, thick iron bracelet (or ingot ?, 6.5 cm. diam.) were recovered just above the floor of the room during the excava- tions of the deep sounding within the room south- east of the 'jog" in Wall 4. Mixed Early Bronze and Iron Age ceramics were found within this sounding beneath the floor of the corridor-shaped room, but these final excavations were not continued into the presumably underlying and undisturbed Bronze Age levels. The Cl excavations exposed the entire exterior facade of the B wall (Fig. 15) between two of its but- tresses, determining that the wall here consisted of five courses, preserved to a height of nearly 4 m., and that the buttresses were firmly bonded with the fortification wall. Cultural materials from the C1 excavations were not abundant, particularly in con- trast to those from B2 located on the opposite side of the B wall, and, as noted, those that were re- covered were mixed Early Bronze and Iron Age wares, presumably disturbed during the construc- tion of the B Wall. A few discontinuous burnt sur- faces and possible hearths extended almost to the face of the B wall, but the only surface that was found throughout the entire 4 x 10 m. C1 excava- tion was the floor on which the B wall had been</page><page sequence="18">18 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES built. There was no obvious indication of a founda- tion trench for the fortification wall. Architecture also was absent, save for two intersecting stone walls that began c. 1.40 m. east of the northern buttress; these roughly contemporaneous walls obviously were built sometime after the construction of the B Wall and may represent more of the Iron Age archi- tecture associated with the C Terrace. Operation C2: Architecture on the C Terrace In contrast to the location of the other excava- tions on the North Hill, the C2 sounding was sited well away from any fortification or circuit wall. The only hint of sub-surface remains came from the just detectable presence of two or three stones on a com- mon alignment which seemed to suggest the pos- sible presence of a fairly long stretch of wall. Once an initial probe had confirmed the likelihood of this supposition, the trench was enlarged to include an area 8 x 8 m. in size (Fig. 18). Even this extension did not prove large enough, however, to encompass more than a portion of the expansive court or enclosure that has since begun to be defined. By the end of the season the work had exposed two joining wall socles, each just over 1 m. in width and 1 m. in height (Fig. 18 and P1. IIId). The exposed stretch of the longer wall (Wall 1) runs NNW-SSE for a distance of 9.50 m., while the sec- ond wall (Wall 2), which joins the first at right angles, could only be traced for a distance of just under 3 m. before it disappeared into the west baulk of the trench. Apart from the quite respectable size and appearance of these two wall socles, it is of interest to note that a 2 m. wide band of floor adjacent to Wall 1 was both paved and plastered (P1. IIId ). While it may be assumed that a paved and plastered strip of this width will extend for the full length of Wall 1, we still cannot say why only such a limited part of the entire enclosure came to be treated in this way. Equally puzzling is the presence of a large field stone which lies at right angles to Wall 1 (Fig. 18); but since the base of the stone appears from current indications to lie a few centimetres above the level of the pavement, we are probably safe in assuming that it either rolled or fell into its present location at some date after the abandonment of the C2 Area.

Plan and elevation of Wall B in Area B2/C1. Consistent with the fact that we are probably deal- ing with an external space, there were very few finds from the C2 Area. The pottery that was recovered consisted in the main of local Iron Age sherds together with an admixture of distinctive bowl sherds which once again can be related to the ceramic traditions of Urartu. In other words the spa- cious enclosure under discussion is most likely, like much of the rest of the major architecture on the north citadel hill, to date from the eighth/seventh centuries B.C. when, at the very least, Urartian influ- ences were remarkably strong. Operation C3: The Gate 6 Area Two separate excavations bracket the 1990 sound- ing, one (C3b) extending between the C wall and the earlier trench, and the other (C3a) separated from the earlier trench by a meter wide baulk.

The pottery associated with this deposit was almost entirely the local Early Iron Age ware, among which appeared certain forms and fabrics considered the chronological equivalent of Urartian pottery. The pottery assemblage also included</page><page sequence="20">20 JOURNAL. OF PERSIAN STUDIES a few Early Bronze Age, and several Middle Bronze Age sherds. The operation against the C Fortification Wall, C3b, uncovered the continuation of the major Early Iron Age stone wall, Feature 5, unfortunately with- out revealing its relationship with the fortification wall itself. Feature 5, constructed of large unshaped stones, bordered a meter thick sequence of fill deposits that contained several ephemeral surfaces, all capping a more permanent surface, Feature 16. The latter extended from the Early Iron Age wall to the C Fortification Wall, where a foundation trench for the fortification wall seems to have cut the sur- face away. A series of small shallow pits appeared in Feature 16 near the Feature 5 wall, and a lightly built and heavily damaged stone wall ran east-west across the surface. Feature 16 seems to have been laid over another lightly built stone wall that runs north-south; the latter remained unexcavated. A copper or bronze needle and several blue and green frit beads occurred on the Feature 16 surface. The pottery on and just above Feature 16 again belonged to the local Early Iron Age tradition. As with C3a, many of these sherds belong to the last phases of that period; unlike other parts of the site, however, no Urartian-like pottery appeared in either of the C3 operations. Soundings through Feature 16 indi- cated additional Early Iron Age deposits, and exposed the top of an unexcavated pit. The Iron Age pottery from these lower levels bear some typo- logical similarity with the southern citadel hill assemblages, and these deposits may belong to the late second millennium. The C3b operation revealed a foundation trench against the inner face of the C Fortification Wall, just west of Gate 6. This trench extended 1.5 m. deep, and lies against the upper three to four cours- es of the wall. Since the fortification wall extends downward at least several more courses, the founda- tion trench likely represents a rebuilding episode of HOROM 1992 AREA C2 1641.00 1641.30 PAVED AND PLASTERED SURFACE FLOOR 1641.00 1640.01 x 1640.90 Fig. 18.

On the eastern side of Gate 6, the C4 and El Operations exposed the base of the forti- fication wall immediately below the ground surface. The wall at this point, only three to four courses high, is constructed of irregularly sized and unshaped massive stones, and gives the appearance of hasty construction. In general, the C Fortification Wall is built of large irregularly laid stones, often chinked with smaller stones (see Fig. 17). This con- struction differs considerably from that found in the B Fortification Wall, where regular courses of smaller but uniformly sized stones face a rubble fill (compare Figs. 15-17). These distinctions support the original supposition that the two walls were made at different times (Badaljan et al. 1992). The B1 and B2/C1 operations reveal late Early Iron Age associations with the B Fortification Wall. The chronology of the C Fortification Wall remains unclear, however; additional work in this area is required to establish the settlement history of this section of Horom. Operation DI: The "Administrative Complex" In response to the distinctive character of the D Area, which is almost without any form of defense, and which can be seen to form a discrete, final addi- tion to the north citadel hill's otherwise sweeping, contour-hugging divisions, special attention came to be paid to what appears to be the southern end of a latterly significant N-S line of communication through this part of the site. In the time that was available, two adjacent units were examined in this particular vicinity (Fig. 19 ). Room 1 literally projects southwards, well beyond the line of the D Area's boundary wall that ascends from the east. This arrangement permitted the introduction of a narrow doorway in the room's short east wall. As if to meet the needs of consider- able foot traffic, moreover, most of the room was paved, with possibly the greatest degree of attention going to the area between the outer doorway in the east wall and an adjacent inner doorway in the north wall. In addition, a line of stones towards the west end of the room marks the edge of an elevated plat- form from which, very conceivably, movement through the rest of the room was monitored. With the long axis of Room 1 running E-W and the long axis of Room 2 running N-S, it is interest- ing to note that, while this entranceway to the D Area can hardly be said to be "defended" in any nor- mal sense, it did include a bent axis approach and it did involve the use of an inner passage which, at its narrowest, was only 60 cm. wide. While Room 1 was 6.7 m. long x 3.8 m. wide, and could well have been roofed, the main walls of Room 2 (or perhaps Court 2) enclose an area that was 10 x 8 m. in size. Excavations in this latter space are still in progress and further work may reveal the presence of additional "cubicles", such as those that are already suggested by a number of internal wall alignments on the western side of the room. Of interest also is the still very narrow width of the doorway leading to the next unit to the north (Fig. 19) and the presence, near the north-west cor- ner of Room 2, of a large sub-rectangular basin (P1. IIIe) capable of holding water. Overall, the exposed stone wall socles in the D Area are very varied in character, with a some- times solid and a sometimes quite insubstantial appearance. It is also notable that most of the D Area construction is founded directly on bedrock, and that the depth of the deposit seldom exceeds 80 cm. In other words, even if the excavated pottery forms from the D Area are very similar to those that have been noted from other areas of the eighth/seventh century B.C. occupation within the B and C Fortification Walls on the north citadel hill, it is perfectly possible that the D Area buildings were erected at a relatively late date within this restricted time range and that they did not remain in use for very long. Conclusion and Future Prospects The' 1992 American/Armenian excavations at Horom represented the first intensive investigation of this long-recognised major prehistoric settlement on the Shirak plain of northwestern Armenia. Our understanding of the Horom settlement has changed, particularly in relation to the clear archi- tectural and ceramic evidence from the major oper- ations on the northern citadel hill that document intensive interaction with and probable incorpora- tion into the Urartian kingdom, possibly during the early eighth century B.C. The excavations demon- strated that the architecture associated with this Urartian presence was substantial and exceptionally well-preserved. The cyclopean fortifications of the B wall, in particular, showed that its walls were pre- served to heights exceeding 4 metres and that there were completely buried stone walls abutting these fortifications preserved to heights of over three metres. The ceramics associated with this well-pre- served architecture on the northern citadel hill con- sisted mainly of the local "Early Iron Age" grey wares interspersed with regularly occurring, highly fired Urartian-like reddish brown plates and vessels. In short, the areas of well-preserved architecture on the northern hill suggested a final major occupation during the eighth/seventh centuries B.C., contem- poraneous with the fluorescence of the Urartian kingdom to the south. A major question for future work on the northern hill concerns the degree of</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES transformation of the pre-existing Early Iron (and possibly Middle/Late Bronze?) Age culture as a result of these relations with the Urartians. Even if the Urartian conquest and incorporation of the Horom citadel is confirmed, it is unlikely that the site became a typical Urartian fortress. Continuity with the local cultural tradition is apparent, and the site obviously was situated near the northern fron- massive Iron Age remains. Further excavations in the Cl area, however, will provide an opportunity to determine whether or not we have found the Early Bronze cemetery associated with this possibly late fourth millennium settlement and/or whether or not there is also Early Bronze architecture to be found beneath the surface on which the B Fortification Wall had been built. Secondly, excava- HOROM 1992 AREA D 1642 96 -?? - IBAS Mlz I o 1 2 ot~ ~ ~1 Fig. 19. Plan of Rooms 1 and 2 in Area D. tier of the kingdom, giving it a special character that requires better definition. One of the immediate challenges will be to disentangle the pre-Urartian Iron Age occupation, which may have extended well back into the Late and even Middle Bronze periods (that is, possibly into the first half of the second mil- lennium B.C., as intimated by the above-cited C14 date and the architecture and pottery from Trench El), from the massive fortifications lying over them on the northern hill which, on present evidence, seem to have been built either by the Urartians themselves or by contemporaries sharing similar architectural skills. The following problems will be addressed next season. First, investigation of the Early Bronze occu- pation, which must have been substantial, is ham- pered throughout the settlement by the overlying, tions need to be continued on the southern hill, particularly to understand better the enigmatic ritu- al (?) features uncovered in the M1/6 operation and to characterise the more primitive fortifications visible particularly on the southern slope of the southern hill. Thirdly, more cromlechs from differ- ent visible clusters of tombs to the east and south of the settlement will be opened to ascertain differ- ences in status and/or date. Most work clearly will focus on the northern citadel hill and its apparent transformation with the advent of the Urartians. Investigation of the earlier Late Bronze/Iron Age settlement on the northern hill is also hampered by the fortifications con- structed in the second quarter of the first millenni- um B.C., though continuation of the excavations on either side of the C Wall near Gate 6 should reveal</page><page sequence="23">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1992 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 23 remains from at least some of the second and early first millennium B.C. occupations preceding the Urartians. Substantial structures that are visible both within the system of fortifications (e.g., near the northeastern corner of the C Wall) and between the southern and northern hills and that appear to be associated with the final Urartian period can easily be uncovered, and the B2 excavations will be expanded to reveal more of the substantial arch- itecture built against the interior face of the B Fortification Wall and the extension of these structures farther west across the B Terrace. Finally, it is hoped to initiate a computerised digital map- ping project of the topography and visible and exca- vated architecture on the northern citadel hill that will allow us to generate a series of three-dimension- al site reconstructions. The 1992 excavations at Horom would have been impossible without the generous assistance of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences in Yerevan and the newly- founded, private Shirak Foundation. The joint American/Armenian investigations are pioneering in many respects, not the least of which is their pri- vate support by sponsors of the Shirak Foundation from the Republic of Armenia itself. Archaeology, like other sciences generally throughout the former Soviet Union, has been drastically cut back as a result of the hardships associated with the transition to the new market-based economy. As a result, the future of scientific investigations into Armenia's rich ancient past lies with programmes like ours that are truly collaborative in structure. Many more seasons of fruitful archaeological excavations at Horom and other sites on the Shirak plain lie ahead. Bibliography Badaljan, R. S. and 0. K. Agekjan, (1991).

I The invaluable assistance of many Armenian colleagues must be acknowledged; specifically, the 1992 excavations simply could not have taken place without the never flagging assist- ance of Vladimir (Vovo) M. Kostandjan, Ruben Z. Tonikjan and Ruben Mnatsakanjan of the Shirak Foundation. The sup- port of Dr. Gevork Tiratsjan, the Director of the Institute, and Dr. Aram Kalantarjan, Department Head of Salvage Archaeology of the Institute, also is most gratefully acknowl- edged. The expert assistance of N. S. Pogosjan and 0. K. Agekjan proved essential for the excavations of the two crom- lechs, TI and T2, and 0. Agekjan's drawings of these tombs appear as Figs. 7 and 8 in this article. We are also most grateful for the invaluable support of private sponsors, particularly the Yerevan Jewellery Factory, of the Shirak Foundation and the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Armenia. 2 The American work at Horom was sponsored by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (RO-22523-92). Apart from travel and excavation funds provided by Wellesley College and the Univ. of California at Berkeley, several private sponsors also must be acknowledged for their essential sup- port.: the American School of Prehistoric Research, Peabody Museum, Harvard Univ., particularly the Director C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky; Ms. Louise Simone of the Armenian General Benevolent Union; Arthur T. and Phebe Gregorian; Carolyn G. Mugar of the Mugar Foundation; and Mrs. Alice Mirak. The following graduate and undergraduate students participated in the 1992 excavations at Horom: Sharon Steadman, Jennifer Ross, and Kim Codella from the Univ. of California, Berkeley; Sabina Shahrokhizadeh, Kathryn Keith, and Adam Smith from the Univ. of Arizona; Julie Pearce from the Univ. of Pennsylvania; and E. Ann Carson, Tiffany Rieser, Abigail Mauk, and Rachel Onanian from Wellesley College. The excavations could not have been conducted without their assistance-sometimes under trying conditions. The work of the architect/draftsperson, Ms. Eleanor Barbanes (who also directed the work in the B1 Area), must be especially men- tioned; her illustrations appear as Figs. 1-3, 11, 13, and 15-19 in this article. 3 Ms. Barbara Isaac's Palaeolithic investigations were assisted by Dr. Zaal Kikodze of the National Museum and Georgian State Univ. in Tbilisi. Their trips to the Djavakheti plateau were accompanied by Drs. Merab Tvacrelidze and Jijiko Janelidze and students from the Georgian State Univ. 4 Prof. Dr. Gerhard Bosinski of the Univ. of Cologne graciously gave B. Isaac and P. Kohl an extensive tour of Dmanisi when they arrived unannounced at the site in late July. Ms. Isaac later visited the site when it was being excavated and again was the beneficiary of boundless Georgian and German hospitality. 5 Dr. Richard Redding provided preliminary identification of Area Cl's Early Bronze Age tomb hominid remains. All the human skeletal material from the 1992 excavations will be analysed next year by a physical anthropologist. 6 Dr. Richard Redding analysed the faunal remains, and Ms. Karen Sperling retrieved and was responsible for the analysis of palaeobotanical materials from the 1992 excavations.</page><page sequence="24">24 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES CATALOGUE Figure 9. 1.
