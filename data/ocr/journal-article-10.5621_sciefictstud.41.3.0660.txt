His complication of Castle’s thesis underpins his concept of the Gothic machine, since “hybrids of Gothic writing and phantasmagoriana ... relied heavily on a rich field of signifiers for the numinous, a potent and ongoing sense of external supernatural agency, for their full effect” (85). In pursuit of understanding how specific types of fear fueled the machine, Jones points out how the Gothic has interacted with period-specific cultural anxieties. Despite his stated disinclination toward the psychoanalytic, his occasional speculations about the anxieties and sensations that historical audiences would have experienced are among the more compelling moments in the text. I was intrigued by the way, for example, that he reminds readers of how Robertson’s show was fueled energetically by the residual historical traumas inflicted by Robespierre in the very site where it was staged, as well as the fear of these terrors reoccurring.  Sf scholars will find Chapters Five and Six, where Jones touches on the work of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, particularly useful. Jones emphasizes Gothic thematics in sf, focusing on narratives that portray a superstitious fear of new technology rather than the idealism sometimes associated with the nineteenth-century scientific romance; in his words, certain “fin-de-siècle Gothic fictions ... dramatized the more menacing, unknown aspects of contemporary science, drawing on the language of visual projection” (179). For example, he claims that Wells used The Time Machine (1895) to “re- Gothicize recent developments in optical science” (178) by suggesting that the temporal mastery associated with Muybridge’s photographs, as with time travel, cannot forestall the threat of atavism embodied in the cannibalistic Morlocks. Jones’s discussion of Villiers’s L’Eve future [The Future Eve, 1886] interestingly reframes the sf trope of the female android by locating the creation of the novel’s robotic Hadaly among the fragmented (and, for Jones, Gothicized) bodies of early cinema, reading the fictionalized Thomas Edison, her creator, as a diabolical projectionist. Jones’s choice to read L’Eve future without reference to its bizarre gender politics is indicative of his larger tendency to avoid using texts as documents of class, race, or gender ideologies, instead opting to illustrate the complexity and specificity of the media environment that germinated new outgrowths. With its ambitious scope, excellent bibliography of current scholarship, and impressive conjuration of literary references both canonical and obscure, this study will serve as a valuable—if slightly unwieldy—sourcebook for anyone interested in the history of the Gothic or of popular visual media.—Mackenzie Gregg, University of California, Riverside Close Encounters Since the Cold War.

Beginning in the early 1950s, some American citizens claimed to have experienced contact with anthropomorphic extraterrestrial visitors who delivered warnings and advice to prevent the imminent destruction of Earth. </page> <page sequence="2"> BOOKS IN REVIEW 661 Aaron John Gulyas offers a complex and detailed overview of this contactee movement. Gulyas’s solid, well-researched, and accessible account explores the longstanding continuities apparent in contactee tales while also identifying some of the key ruptures that separate them. Importantly, Gulyas does not just trace the movement’s beginnings during the Atomic Age (as previous discussions have tended to do) but he also looks at its more nuanced and expansive incarnations as they have continued to appear into the twenty-first century. While his main focus is on the hub of the movement in the United States, Gulyas also examines some of the significant cross-cultural accounts of alien contact, linking these tales to their broader cultural, social, and historical contexts.  Gulyas’s chapters are organized chronologically. The first two provide background on the history of UFOs and American political and social conditions during the Cold War. In chapter three, Gulyas turns to the origins of the contactee movement and discusses the first famous example, the Polish- born American George Adamski. Adamski’s contactee tales would establish a legacy tying extraterrestrial contact to tangible concerns of the time—notably, atomic testing. Gulyas’s next chapter traces connections between Adamski’s pioneering story and those of later contactees, such as Truman Bethurum and George Hunt Williamson, among others. The next few chapters examine the more recent incarnations of the contactee movement from the New Age 1970s to the present. In chapter five, Gulyas shows how contactee tales underwent a more personal transformation, with channeled psychic messages and religious overtones coming to dominate many contact writings of the time. Gulyas also explores the global expansion of the contactee movement as it evolved through Billy Meier’s stories in Switzerland and Dr. George King’s tales in England. He ends this chapter by discussing the “exopolitics” movement, which blends contactee sentiments for reform with political conspiracy narratives that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Like the contactee movement, the exopolitics movement believes that extraterrestrials hold the solutions to the problems of humanity but that conspiring governmental and industrial forces prevent us from advancing. Chapter six examines the negative and more sinister aspects of contactee tales, particularly through Albert Bender’s darker “Men in Black” narrative, wherein the visitors are far from friendly; yet this narrative maintains continuity with earlier contactee stories by expounding societal concerns and aspirations. Chapter seven explores the role of sex and gender in contactee narratives, as Gulyas carefully examines the peripheral but significant role women have played in the movement. His final chapter summarizes the continuities and ruptures that have characterized the phenomenon across the past six decades. Throughout, Gulyas argues that there is a deeper dimension to contactees’ fascination with extraterrestrials that echoes the hopes, fears, and desires of our own species. Rather than focusing solely on the tropes of sinister invasion scenarios and alien abductions, Gulyas looks at the generally more positive interactions of contactees with “space brothers” and “space sisters,” exploring how those claiming extraterrestrial contact use their narratives to disseminate </page> <page sequence="3"> 662 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) their own political and philosophical ideas. Pointedly, Gulyas affords contactees a great deal of agency. Whereas other literature often relegates contactees to a fringe sphere, seeing their behavior as an escapist reaction to social fears and traumas, Gulyas instead argues that contactees used—and use—their narratives as a strategy to convey relevant political messages and to encourage social change in America, Europe, and all over the globe. From warnings about the dangers of nuclear weaponry, to criticisms of capitalism, to fears of environmental degradation, to anxieties about mandatory vaccin- ations, to concerns over race relations, contactee stories have consistently conveyed messages of political commentary and social protest. Occasionally, Gulyas’s writing is somewhat repetitive. At other times, intriguing topics—such as the relationship of contactee tales to evangelical Christianity—are raised briefly only to be left undeveloped. Overall, however, Gulyas is successful in exploring the political and philosophical aspects of contactee stories. Thus, while his chronicle may reveal little about life in the universe, it offers a strikingly important commentary about life here on Earth. —Laura Thursby, Trent University Compelling but Uneven Collection. Marie-Hélène Huet. The Culture of Disaster. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2012. ix + 261. $45 hc. Marie-Hélène Huet is an emeritus Professor of French at Princeton. Her first book, in 1973, was on Jules Verne and she later wrote Monstrous Imagination (1993), which weaves Mary Shelley into the contexts of biological and political revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. Monstrous Imagination also dealt with Diderot, Hawthorne, Balzac, and Villiers de l’Isle Adam: this list indicates that she has an interest in the scientific and the fantastic while resolutely staying within the canon of acceptable literary taste. The same is true for The Culture of Disaster, which has a sustained chapter on Jules Verne and a section on Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), but these are hardly treated in any science-fictional context, appearing alongside elegant treatments of Rousseau, Michelet, Chateaubriand, and Michelangelo Antonioni. You are, in other words, in for a high-art, high-French-theory ride. Huet’s book of loosely connected essays aims to pursue the thesis that post- Enlightenment modernity is marked by a passage from religious interpretations of disaster towards not so much natural explanation (the secularization argument) as thoroughly imbricated social explanations, in which disaster becomes “an administrative problem of political containment” (2). Huet explores how classical thought about the dis-astro—the unlucky star, the star out of alignment, the comet in the sky that brings or portends catastrophe— leaves a trace in the thought of modernity regarding natural and political catastrophes. The book explores this thesis most compellingly in the opening section, which tracks in three chapters how the eighteenth-century approach to outbreaks of plague shifted from the treatment of the disaster that entered France via Marseilles in 1720, through the famous impact of the Lisbon Earthquake in 1755 on Enlightenment philosophers, ending with the global cholera epidemic of the 1830s. This was the first plague whose path (if not </page> </plain_text>
