<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEARLSHELL SYMBOLISM IN HIGHLANDS PAPUA NEW GUINEA, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE WIRU PEOPLE OF SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE Jeffrey Clark School of Behavioural Sciences, J aines Cook University of North Queensland Pearlshells, in their use in exchange in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, have usually been analysed as ' power tokens' in a political context dominated by big men. This article attempts to account for the historically recent acceptance and use of pearlshells in terms of symbolic and aesthetic, rather than political and economic, values. The symbolism of two types of pearlshell found among Wiru people is considered, and an overview of available material on pearlshells in the Highlands is presented A comparative perspective using historical, ethnographic and linguistic evidence, supports the claim that pearlshells were incorporated into ceremonial exchange because of their symbolic and aesthetic connections with the natural world and a cycle of death and regenesis. INTRODUCTION In 1935 Jack Hides, while leading the Strickland-Purari patrol into the interior of then Papua, was approached by a Southern Highlands man who held up a pearlshell crescent with the 'utmost reverence ... (t)he expression on his face told us plainly that he was asking if we had such a beautiful thing in our possession' (Hides 1973:125). Unfortunately for Hides and for many of the Highlanders' he encountered, his patrol carried no shell - a fatal omission (see Crittenden andSchieffelin 1991). James Sinclair, a long-serving patrol officer in the Southern Highlands and the biographer of Hides, noted that the people contacted by the 1935 patrol 'worshipped shell, and in particular the gleaming, irridescent (sic) mother of pearl' (1969:126). Hides was an astute enough observer to recognize the ' reverence' which the ' beauty' of the pearlshell (Pinctada maxima) inspired. Despite this early recognition of an aesthetic component to Highlanders appreciation of pearlshells, anthropologists of diverse theoretical persuasions have concentrated on the pearlshell as a wealth item or 'power token' (A. Strathern 1979:539) which men, particularly big men, attempt to monopolize to maintain their status and influence over other men. With the exception of Wagner (1978, 1986), M. Strathern (1981, 1984), and J. Weiner (1988), anthropologists have usually discussed pearlshells in terms of their exchange in a prestige economy, paying little attention to how (a)s self-contained entities, no more and no less than the human presences they often mediate, pearlshells combine the enhancement of ornament with the significance of human vitality into a kind of power (Wagner 1978:64). For the Daribi of MtKarimui pearlshells ' make and carry forth the image of man' (ibid ) and, in their colour and shape, dazzle, like the sun and moon; they are beautiful (ibid.:65). Apart Oceania, 61, 1991 309</page><page sequence="2">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea from this aesthetic appeal to the senses, however, Wagner does not discuss pearlshells in terms of a symbolic dimension to their construction or constitution. The aesthetic quality of pearlshells is often recognized by anthropologists - ' (t)he Wola are connoisseurs of good shells ... these are objects of beauty and they spend a good deal of time showing them off and discussing their merits' (Sillitoe 1979: 156; cf. A S trathern 1971a: 236-37) - but disregarded in favour of investigating the exchange systems of which they are a part. I am not suggesting that pearlshells were analysed primarily in economic terms. Their importance in exchange was a product of the intense social value and esteem, bordering on veneration, which attached to them (cf. Sillitoe 1979:153). A Porsche sports-car has an economic and utilitarian value, yet to analyse its appeal to an owner in these terms would be to miss its importance as a sign of status, power and virility in a world of consumerism, ostentatious display and capital accumulation. A Porsche aestheticizes dominant values in the culture of capitalism and incorporates them into a structure of desire. Similarly, to concentrate on pearlshells only as a 'power token' exchanged between men and groups detracts from their status as obj ects of beauty, desire and, indeed, ' worship' . It is these aspects of pearlshells that make them good to exchange with. A. Strathern (1979:535) suggests reasons for the colour symbolism of Melpa pearlshells in terms of the importance of consanguineal ties through women for the pursuit of moka exchanges. But why were shells adopted for exchange in the first place? Feil (1984:121) opines that their value for Enga may have been due to their scarcity, although he states elsewhere that ' (o)ne must still explain the acceptance by the wider population of pearlshells as a standard of wealth' (Feil 1982:304). The argument still remains overly materialistic. Of all scarce things, why did pearlshells come to carry such a symbolic load and become, along with pigs, the prime exchange items? A. Strathern supplies one possible reason when he writes of pearlshells having an external source, which powerful men could tap into to demonstrate their acquisitive skill to other men, and to indicate that they were ' in control and independent of women' (1979:534) in wealth production. But of all scarce, foreign things, why pearlshells? It may be too late to adequately answer this question, although there are many tantalizing hints in the literature. First, the historic background to the appearance and spread of pearlshells in the Highlands region needs to be considered While people have been living in the Highlands for at least 25,000 years (Gorecki 1986:160), it seems that the pearlshell is a relatively recent introduction. This statement needs to be qualified There is archaeological evidence of pearlshells in the Yuat gorge on the northern fringe of the Highlands. They date to 2000-3000 years BP, and were probably traded up through the central Highlands from the southern coast (Swadling and Anamiato 1989:225, 228-29). Other types of sea shells were traded into the Highlands as long ago as 9000 years BP (White 1972:93; and see Hughes 1977: 199-201), after which shells start to turn up in gradually increasing quantities through trade with the coast. Despite this early evidence for pearlshells, the objects found were slivers, probably worn in the nose or as ear pendants (Swadling and Anamiato 1989:227), and not the pearlshell crescents of the type which, in some parts of the Highlands, are still used for decoration and exchange. Pearlshell crescents appear to be a recent item of wealth, perhaps present for one or two hundred years in the Highlands fringe, and only appearing in the central Highlands in the last decades of the nineteenth century. When European explorers first entered the major Highlands valleys in the 1930s, pearlshell was largely unknown in the east, and present only in small quantities to the west, 310</page><page sequence="3">Clark often as broken bits of shell or as shells which had been painstakingly stitched and stuck back together. Whole crescent shells were only in the possession of powerful and wealthy men (Hughes 1977:191, 193; 49-57). Of the whole shells most were white and of poor quality, the highly esteemed gold-lip shell being rare in the upper Wahgi valley (ibid.:191). Hides, who was travelling eastwards, reported that the pearlshell shown to him by a man of the Wola speaking group, vide the above quote, was the first unbroken piece of pearlshell seen on the expedition (1973:126). F.E Williams, who visited a Wola settlement in 1939, stated that if the people could be persuaded to show their pearlshells they will cautiously undo the voluminous wrappings and reveal shells of a size and weight that are quite astonishing. They are furnished with a finely woven band for the neck, reddened with ochre, and it so happens that the few such specimens I saw had all been broken across and carefully mended. They have the appearance of considerable age ... (Williams 1976:176). To the north of the Wola area whole pearlshell was probably unknown, and pieces were found only in the possession of important men (Meggitt 1956:163; cf. Hughes 1977:57). Near MtHagen explorers found no trace of European items such as steel, which they found impossible to trade for food People only accepted broken pieces of crockery (Hughes 1977: 55), that is, because of their similarity to shell. Pearlshells were introduced into the Highlands along a north-south trade route from the Papuan gulf. For reasons which will be suggested, at some stage in the past pearlshells became one of the most preferred items of trade. S ettlements close to the trade route controlled the passage of shells to the north, and were relatively wealthier than those more distant. A Strathern (1985: 103) suggests that the moka exchange system was itself imported from the south - the Nebilyer valley area where pearlshells were more abundant - into the central Melpa speaking area Hughes (1977:201) states that changes in demand for shell types were no doubt engendered by changes in shell selection on the coast ... Suppliers tended to trade their least valued shells ... But for a shell type to become valuable and in wide demand it probably had to meet specific local aesthetic criteria of the moment, to be suited to a particular ornamental niche regarded there and then as desirable to fill, and to be available in certain minimum quantities. One possible reason for the push of shells into the Highlands was the involvement of Papuans in the Torres Strait pearling industry from 1880 to 1910, and Torres Strait was the source of most pearlshell that found its way into the Highlands (ibid.:25, 45). While an historical reason can be adduced for an increase in the quantities of pearlshell in the Highlands, we are still no closer to understanding what it was about pearlshells that made them valuable. I suggest that an explanation of their use in exchange is inseparable from an account of pearlshell symbolism and aesthetics.1 The increasing use of pearlshells in elaborate ceremonial exchanges, and as items in bridewealth and other compensation payments, could only have come about after they were first deemed appropriate as wealth objects. This perhaps seems a trivial and obvious point, yet it needs to be made in the face of claims that it is only ' use in exchange which gives wealth its value' (Sillitoe 1979:151). An explanation of the value of pearlshells in terms of their scarcity and use in exchange remains tautological and partial. The paper will return to some general comments on pearlshells and aesthetics, but first considers specific examples of the use and symbolism of these valuables in the exchange system of the Wiru people of Pangia district, Southern Highlands Province. 311</page><page sequence="4">PearlsheUSymbolisminHighlandsPapuaNewGuinea PEARLSHELL SYMBOLISM IN PANGIA Hughes (1977:189) reports that Wim, unlike other Highlanders in his study area, claimed the pearlshell was of 'great antiquity'. This can be compared with Williams opinion, quoted above, that the Wola pearlshell has ' the appearance of considerable age' . Unfortunately such observations or reliance on informants' statements tell us little about the time period for pearlshells in the Southern Highlands. What they do tell us is that pearlshells have had a longer presence in the south than in the central Highlands, a fact in itself hardly surprising given the trade routes. Yet this raises an interesting point, namely how long does it take for objects to become incorporated into a society's symbolic logic? This is a difficult if not impossible question to answer, but it does allow us to assume that if pearlshells have had a longer presence in the south then it is likely that more symbolic 'work' has been done on them. In this sense, the extensive symbolism of Wiru pearlshells may be atypical in the Highlands, although this does not diminish the claim that pearlshells have an aesthetic which influenced their acceptance as items of wealth. Wiru exchanges are oriented around life cycle payments, particularly those which involve the compensation of maternal kin for their contribution to the construction of bodies. To understand the logic of these payments, Wiru procreation beliefs first need to be considered It is believed that repeated acts of intercourse are necessary to achieve conception. During intercourse, the umbilici of husband and wife rub together and semen and tomonu, female substance, are shaken loose - a process which somehow primes the woman for conception. The foetus forms in the womb, toboroi, which envelops the tomonu; the form of this substance is described as egg-like, or ntu. Semen, page, is produced in the region of the umbilicus; testicles, muy are not associated with semen production. Their function is to achieve penile erection (they operate like the oil in hydraulic jacks, according to one mechanically minded informant), and nui were closely connected to certain cult stones and fertility (Clark 1985:312). Once semen reaches the totnonu, which is a yellow substance surrounded in the womb by blood, kamare, it binds itself around both substance and blood More semen is needed to successfully complete foetal formation, at which point menstruation and intercourse cease as continued intercourse would harm the foetus and mother. Menstrual blood, abea kamare (dirt blood), is regarded as waste blood which no longer has procreative potential. Men initiate foetal development but women are entirely responsible for foetal growth and nurture, and are thought to do all the 'hard work' (there is a proverb Wiru use about the work required in creating and carrying the foetus: men sit at the top of a tree and cut down branches and women have to collect all the wood from where it falls and carry it away). Semen and blood as necessary elements in procreation conform to a typical Highlands pattern, although after conception Wiru notions appear to diverge; the yellow female substance also seems unusual. Basically, the mother is regarded as creating the entire body - the bones, blood, flesh and organs of the child - whereas elsewhere in the Highlands semen often has a vital role in skeletal constitution, or the womb is merely regarded as a vessel in which men 'grow' the foetus (Gillison 1980:148). The Wiru Adam is made from Eve's rib. The father does, however, give iheyonuni, soul or spirit, to a child As far as I could determine, ancestral spirits play no role in y omini formation as they do in other Highlands societies (A Strathern 1972:9), although they could facilitate conception if the appropriate sacrifices were made. 312</page><page sequence="5">Clark A father's/rage affects the external features of the child but does not contribute to the actual growth, nurturance or physical constitution of the body. The alternatives of gender are seen as equal possibilities within the womb and are not determined by any properties of male substance, either quantitatively (more semen increasing the likelihood of foetal maleness) or qualitatively (by semen having a capacity to affix maleness). If a male child is born it is claimed that ' the man won the fight' , and the mother* s nose is said to point downwards, the nose being associated with male attributes. I could obtain no statements as to how thcyoniini is actually transmitted into the foetus, such as whether it is in the semen or is a metaphysical emanation of the father, but there is a sense in which a father's yonini 'fights' with the woman's natural procreative abilities over the sex of a child While women create bodies, men give individuality to appearance, especially remarked upon in reference to the face, lene-tirnini (eye-nose), and calves of the leg. The father also influences the personal ability and intelligence of his children. I was told that 'mama givim skin, papa givim tingting' (mother gives body, father gives intelligence). Despite the father5 s contribution to the appearance and ability of his children, people have a lifelong commitment to compensating maternal kin for the body which was created in their mothers' wombs. The payment which ego makes is to male matrikin, opianago (men who bear), as if female reproductive ability is controlled by the close male agnates of women who give birth. The fact of payment emphasizes a woman's importance but its direction indicates the locus of control. The bodies created by women, which are 'female' insofar as all children are total products of their mothers, receive the impress of male individuality. Men become less 'female' over time as they pay off their debts in body to matrikin. The act of exchange individualizes and masculinizes the donor, constructing both the person and, synergistically, the agnatic group. Women may create bodies but it is men, through acts of exchange including body payments, who produce individuals and pearlshells, and in the process create a temporal coherence to descent groups. Women and exchanges of the 'affinal-maternal nexus' (A. Strathern 1978:80) ensure the elements necessary for the reproduction and continuity of Wiru society - children, food and wealth. It will be demonstrated that the symbolism of exchange items emerges out of the major context of their use, namely life cycle payments. The exchange which best illustrates this is that between individuals and their opianago, and relates to payments made for the debt in tigini, or body. A person gives pearlshells, ntaiyo, for this debt, and receives as a counter-gift pork ribcages, lunori. While this article is primarily about the place of the pearlshell in symbolic life, the use of pigs and pork in exchange must also be considered Pearlshells, as symbols, can only be understood through contrast with items given against them, which in their meaning oppose that of shells. Pearlshells can be given to opianago at any time but especially at ceremonial pig kills, oino. It is said that they are given with no expectation of return, even though a counter-gift is made. Lunori, pork ribcages, are not the value equivalent of shells, which are given in recompense for something already obtained - one' s body - and for an ongoing benevolent maintenance of it by opianago. These maternal kinsmen can curse individuals and affect their growth and health if they are slow or niggardly in making payments. The imbalance in gifting 'reflects a structurally "given" situation generated from the context of wife-giving and receiving and the reproduction of children' (A. Strathern 1978:87). The gift of lunori is a symbolic statement about the relationship of indebtedness between a person and opianago, and about the nature of the debt. 313</page><page sequence="6">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea The items which are used to mediate between individuals and their opianago obtain their meaning from the context in which they are used, the paying off of a debt for body which simultaneously structures and reproduces social life. The pig, hai, can be given live or dead, whole or in special cuts. Its form and meaning in exchange depends on the context of its prestation. Live pigs are ' the nearest complete equivalent to people' (A Strathern 1981:223), and pork gifts relate to particular aspects of social relationships between people. The sacrifice of pigs in spirit cults, involving offerings of the kidneys and a special cut of meat from the tail, reaffirmed relationships between people, spirits and paternal ancestors. Wiru state that when live pigs are presented in exchange they are 'given for nothing', but when they are gifted as meat debt is settled, lessened or created ' Given for nothing' does not mean there is no return, what this statement refers to is that live pigs are used primarily in compensation, as in bridewealth in which pigs are given for the reproductive ability of the bride, live pigs may be given as a life cycle payment, and also figure in trade and the buying of knowledge (such as sorcery techniques). Live pigs given in exchange represent the person and comment on the social relationship between people. A live pig is a special gift. Pigs are carefully looked after by women, who have a special magic to make them grow. They are nurtured, like children, with women often giving choice cooked sweet potatoes to pigs. These animals are in many ways another form of body which women create. Pigs are most often used in bridewealth or death compensation where they represent or substitute for people on the basis of a negotiated parity between the person concerned and a number of pigs (and other wealth items such as pearlshells, and today money). In a sense, the bodies of people and pigs are interchangeable, they share a metaphoric equivalence. Yet pigs, unlike people, can be cut up into different parts and presented to people. While live pigs represent people in exchange, pork ribcages refer to what is exchanged The aspects of lunori which concern us here are that it is composed of flesh, bone and blood; it is the inside part of a pig; it is the return made by opianago in recognition of pearlshell payments for the body; and ribcages are given cooked The inside of the body, the chest cavity, lungs, etc., is particularly associated with opianago, even though women create the body in its entirety (the innermost parts of a pig, its intestines and offal, are the property of women after butchering). When matrilateral spirits send sickness, tepene yene (trunk sick), it is this part of the body which is most affected (cf.AStrathern 1980:62). The lunori, then, is a convenient symbol for the return made to a person as it represents what he or she is compensating for - the body 'inside' of an individuated person. Ribcages are tepene and composed of flesh, bone and blood, the three elements of bodily constitution. They are given cooked, transformed from their purely female state, just as pearlshell donors have been transformed from this state through masculinizing gifts of pearlshells. After ribcage consumption all that is left are bones, as with bodies which decompose after death. This may demonstrate the control which opianago have over a person' s life and/or the point at which body payments cease - death (A Strathern 1981:211, suggests that opianago, by controlling birth, perhaps to a degree control death). These features of lunori condense into a potent image of the maternal contribution to a person' spine, or base, origin, cause of existence (for an analysis of other porcine parts see Clark 1985:219, 231-33). The act of giving pearlshells to matrilateral kin is cailedpine teigu (I cut the base), conveying a sense in which people are paying off the obligations owed for existence, which their bodies metaphorically and visibly express. It is as pork, which changes the meaning of 'pig' as an exchange item, that various portions of meat become metonyms for relationships between people, whereas pearlshells, 314</page><page sequence="7">Clark like live pigs, stand in a metaphoric position to their owners (cf. M. Strathern 1984). The symbolic logic underlying their use in exchange is tied to the fact that individuals are created by superimposing 'maleness' over bodies derived from female substance. All individuals occupy points on a continuum ranging from male to female, which are not discrete categories in Wiru thought. That individuals incorporate aspects of maleness and femaleness into their beings is illustrated by the colour red This is associated with men but is also the colour of blood which is derived from the maternal line. Many Wiru origin myths refer to descent from female ancestors, making blood, not semen, an apt metaphor for the substance shared between men, and a symbol of agnatic group identity and continuity. Pearlshells are also 'red' in colour and terminology (valuable pearlshells are called kianea maiyo, red pearlshells) and, as we will see, both male and female in their construction. They are a form of male wealth but also comment on its ultimate source - women and reproduction. Pearlshells are durable male wealth given for perishable female substance, the latter symbolized by the countergift of lunori (cf. A. Strathern 1981:212). Maiyo have different names, usually with historical or spatial referents, and different histories of ownership, accounting for variation in their public veneration. A valuable pearlshell may be owned by one man for lengthy periods of time, although he would experience considerable pressure to gift it, and receive much prestige from doing so. All maiyo come to a person ready-made, so to speak, but a man can identify himself with his pearlshell by adding various markers attached by string - or by tying knots in the string itself - to the woven red carrying band joined to the horns of the pearlshell (cf. A. Strathern 1971:238 for Melpa pearlshells). These markers include the bristled end of a pig's tail, kai adapini, if the animal has drawn wealth or that particular maiyo to him; marsupial scrota, tuu nm, to indicateyag/ gifts, payments for a wife' s fertility or children' s growth which are made to affinal or maternal kin; and snail shells, kalo, which indicate a pig for which a man waited a long time or for which he is still waiting. The knots tied in the string can indicate such things as a death compensation payment or a death from sorcery. Pearlshells record death, debts, and exchange achievements, and the more markers and knots there are on maiyo the more valuable they become. Men can personify their male-created wealth in pearlshells just as children are individuated by their paternity. It is precisely because maiyo have the propensity for standing for the person who owns them, who has their pine or base, that the use of pearlshells in compensation for body is highly appropriate. A man is obliged to make this prestation to opianago and to continually confront his own pine, although this debt for body can be ameliorated by presenting through maiyo a representation of what he has become through his own creative efforts, that is, his masculine individuality (women can own and gift pearlshells but they do not individuate them). What a man makes of himself is given for what opianago have 'caused' and, in a sense, own - the man's body. This parallels the logic of giving cooked ribcages, basic female substance which has been transformed through cooking, a diacritical cultural activity, as an appropriate symbolic countergift. There are other dimensions of meaning which are embodied in maiyo. When they initially come into circulation gold-lip pearlshells are yellow in colour, but men soon rub a red ochre powder, lokeo, over them, and into the woven carrying band (the ochre comes from deposits found near streams and is obtained by fire and crushing). This procedure is repeated before their use in exchange or display. Red is a colour associated with men, especially their noses, and with wealth; ochre powder is also rubbed into certain cult stones associated with health and fertility. Red is related to the sphere of male endeavour and is not directly linked 315</page><page sequence="8">Pearlshell Symbolism in HighlandsPapuaNewGuinea to the nexus of body payments. It makes statements about a male potential to generate and control wealth and fertility as opposed to a woman's and opianago control over bodily reproduction. The bottom edge of the pearlshell crescent, pouwe, is coated with white tree sap, which turns black after setting: lokeo is then rubbed in to form a dark red band The only other work done on the pearlshell itself is a pattern incised under the top rim of the crescent, which is said to represent the line and dot markings of the larval stage of a certain beetle, which in this stage is yellow (see Hg.l for an idealized pearlshell drawn by a Wiru informant). The red edge of maiyo opposes this design, tobe keli (tobe is the name of the larva, keli refers to a pattern or marking), an observation which becomes significant when it is related to the constitution of the pearlshell: it is yellow underneath, in its body, before it is externally transformed through an application of redness/maleness. Figure 1: The pearlshell and its parts The beetle larva, tobe, is yellow, a colour associated with women and their womb substance. It lives in decaying matter in the ground and metamorphizes into a black, flying beetle which is said to live in trees. Black is another colour strongly linked with men and used in body decoration. Its use derives from the association made between cassowaries, largely black in colour, and certain male qualities such as strength and bachelorhood These qualities of men which are associated with nature are themselves subj ect to a * cultural' coating of redness. Tobe is in the category of things belonging to women, aroanea, which includes animals, insects or crops grown or found in the ground or at ground level. This category is 316</page><page sequence="9">Clark contrasted with male food, alinone, which is animals and crops grown or found above ground level, such as bananas and marsupials, or tubers such as yam or taro which have tall growing parts. The life stages of the beetle seem to allow for an expression, through the medium of niaiyo, of an opposition between men and women along the lines of male: female :: high: low :: outside:inside. This opposition is embodied at another level through the contrast between the top and bottom edges of the pearlshell crescent. The tree which supplies the sap for the bottom edge is the wiru tree or hoop pine (Araucaria cunningharrùi), as well as providing the name for Pangia people and their language. Tree sap is cdlledpage, which is also the term for semen and, given the connections made between men and trees (cf. LeRoy 1978:63 for the Kewa), it is not unreasonable to suggest a connection between semen and tree sap (breast milk can also be page, although no correspondence between tree sap and milk was suggested by informants. The context suggests that the referent of wiru page is, in this instance, semen). Trees provide metaphors for the erectness of the male world (cf. Brennan 1977 on Engan cosmology), and rituals associated with the patrilineal spirit cult emphasized the connection between testicles, cult stones and the erectness of growth. As Lindenbaum (1984:356) comments on the Gahuku-Gama, there is a 'phallic sense of being' . The pouwe rim of the pearlshell is made from page, analogous with semen, and associated with the male colours of red and black. The opposing rim, tobe keli, is associated with female qualities and the colour yellow, analogous with tornonu, female substance. Pearlshells encompass notions of gender, procreation and exchange: if semen is at the edge, nani, of the pearlshell it is also the edge (in the sense of instigating) of children and exchange relationships. The pouwe rim is also referred to as the head, tobou, of the pearlshell, a part of the body identified with maleness. Pearlshells, before money, were known as the 'head' of all things, that is, the item of supreme value in Wiru culture. The horns of the pearlshell crescent are its kawa or legs. The iridescent surface of niaiyo, its brilliance enhanced by ochre, is referred to as its skin, kepene. The back of the pearlshell is called tepe, a term which refers to the stomach region, which is also identified with female qualities and thought of by informants as between the head and legs of the pearlshell. The tobe rim is associated with femaleness and the womb, and the two rims again bring out the opposition between high and low, male and female, outside and inside. The anatomical breakdown of niaiyo into head, stomach, skin and legs makes it quite clear that the pearlshell is a representation of the human body and a comment, through the referents of semen and toinonu, on the processes of its creation. The opposing categories of high and low, male and female, red/black and yellow, semen and female substance, etc., are nevertheless contained within the pearlshell as an anthropomorphic entity. This mirrors the constitution of a person as abody, inherently female and derived from yellow substance, over which is superimposed the paternally contributed and culturalized self, male and red The individuation of bodies corresponds to the personification of pearlshells, through the attachment of markers or knots to the carrying band, which signify acts of exchange and memory (cf. Battaglia 1983). Maiyo are decorated with colours and objects which men also wear when decorating, adornments which are on the surface or skin of the body. This relates to the sense in which 'individuation' is used - a transformation of self involving the oppositions discussed above. A man does not permanently own pearlshells, and they carry not only his individuating marks but those of other men. Maiyo represent both the individual donor, as a presentation of self, and, through exchanges in time and space, men in general. The more 'history' a 317</page><page sequence="10">Pearlshell Symbolismin HighlandsPapuaNewGuinea pearlshell can display the more valuable it becomes, and the better it displays the self of its present owner. At a diachronic level rnaiyo do not represent any kind of descent group continuity, as they continually pass between people of different districts and descent. Yet at a given moment die combined pearlshells of a descent group may stand for its present status and viability. This is not the same as Wagner's notion of a stock of male wealth among the Daribi (1967:150-51; see also A Strathern 1971b), as Wiru descent groups do not oppose each other on the basis of marriage, and rnaiyo in life cycle payments are usually made by individuals not groups. The exchange of maiyo from generation to generation, creating individuals, mirrors the reproduction by women of a succession of bodies, but not groups, over time. Men create pearlshells as they do the self, agnatic identity and descent groups. People give pearlshells, which represent acts of individuation by themselves and others, to their matrikin as compensation for body, their original female substance, for which a return of ribcages is made. The act of giving pearlshells to matrikin is to some extent, perhaps, a sacrifice of self, a presentation of one's own individuality to ensure a continued benevolent maternal influence, symbolized by the return of lunori (undifferentiated female substance). There is also a sense in which giving rnaiyo is making a statement about the donor's worth or status. Maiyo gifts oppose the maternal contribution to body and, through the act of cutting a person away from the 'base', opianago have to socially recognise the individuality of the donor. Maiyo are strongly associated with men and belong in the category of 'male' wealth items, yet they are not themselves sexed because, in terms of their external and internal dimensions, rnaiyo are both male and female respectively. Pearlshells, in their constitution and exchange, reflect on beliefs about procreation and individuation, that is, on the essential androgynous constitution of the person. This may be why, in Wiru society, it is difficult to find rigid gender distinctions, at the symbolic level, which use oppositions found in nature and culture. As remarked above, /nß/yo/pearlshells allow men the illusion of producing wealth independently of women, even though, in the last analysis, it is women' s reproduction which stimulates the flow of pearlshells. Maiyo are not, like pigs, the product of female labour, and can be used in support of an independent male domain of status and power through the mystification of women's wealth generating abilities (cf. AStrathern 1979). This is given symbolic recognition in the pearlshell itself. Maiyo as 'dominant symbol', like the famous mudyi tree of the Ndembu (Turner 1967:20-24), embodies multiple and sometimes conflicting meanings. If maiyo is a dominant symbol, the singular pearlshell now to be discussed represents, in Wiru society, the equivalent of the unified field theory in physics. A FEMALE PEARLSHELL The analysis of maiyo reveals that, while they are 'male' wealth, as individual pearlshells they are not gendered Melpa pearlshells, by comparison, which are also 'male' wealth, are often given female names (M. Strathern 1984: 163) and are coated with red ochre, a ' female' colour (A Strathern 1979:535). Pearlshells are detachable, ' on the skin' , like Melpa women, for whom they are metonyms (M. Strathern 1984: 168-69). In contrast, the red colour of Wiru pearlshells is associated with maleness, and their names often have historical-spatial but rarely gender referents. Maiyo are the body rather than being on its surface, and reflect its constitution in terms of internally 'female' and externally 'male' dimensions. They are 318</page><page sequence="11">Clark metaphors for the person. The androgynous quality of niaiyo comments on their mediatory role in exchanges between a man and his 'female' source (even though men present themselves and their shells in terms of their exteriors). There is another type of pearlshell which has different formal and aesthetic attributes compared to ' ordinary' pearlshells. It is called y obo niaiyo and is very valuable, the equivalent of up to 50 top quality niaiyo. I was told by older men that nowadays none remain in Pangia because of their value, all being traded or exchanged outside of the district. It is difficult to know if yobo niaiyo would retain their preeminence today, given their stated absence, the fact that the political context for their use has changed, and the primacy of money for younger men. (Mawe 1985:32, reports that a similar pearlshell in the Mendi area has lost its previous significance, while Lederman 1986:86, states that very valuable Mendi pearlshells are not exchanged because of the undermining, with colonial rule, of their role in cementing interclan warfare alliance). A common pidgin term for especially valuable pearlshells is chet kina' (head pearlshell, MP) but, apart from odd references to them in the literature (e.g., Sillitoe 1979:146) and in conversations with other anthropologists, I am unaware of any analyses of them. The term 'het kina' is not used for pearlshells in Pangia, despite their attribution as 'head' of all things. Yobo rnaiyo has many qualities which set it apart from other pearlshells. It cannot be owned by one man as it is far too valuable for an individual to possess and, more importantly, this sort of ownership is antithetical to its 'meaning'. In Takuru, the fieldwork settlement, yobo rnaiyo were owned by a group at the clan level. It cannot be used for the same purposes as ordinary rtraiyo - bridewealth and life-cycle payments for the body. Instead they are given to other groups in exchange for land, or to allies who have killed many men in fights assisting the donor group. Groups also compete against each other to obtain yobo niaiyo from its current owner, and many valuables are given in exchange for it. A group which possesses this pearlshell obtains much status from the fact, and would be reluctant to part with it. Yobo niaiyo can also be given as a lethal gift to enemy settlements or to groups with which the donors are in dispute. Pearlshells are associated with individuals and body payments in a kinship context, whereas yobo niaiyo are associated with groups and a political rather than kinship context. The former are stored either in the houses of their owners or preferably in the house of a headman of a particular sub-clan or lineage. To reiterate a point made above, this collective storage does not represent a stock of group wealth but was done to safeguard pearlshells from theft or fire in the event of a raid, one house being easier to defend than many. This practice also hid pearlshells from wives, inhibiting their influence over wealth distribution. Yobo niaiyo are kept in the house of a tiobago, a type of man characterized in the Highlands as a 1 rubbish man'. The literal meaning of tiobago is closer to 'crippled man' but the implications are the same. He is a man of low status who, even if married, has no children, and is the possessor of little or no wealth. Tiobago, who may actually live in deserted women's houses, are assigned to sloxtyobo niaiyo, for which duty they are given a large pig. The reason given for this practice was that the power stored in this pearlshell, which reinforces the strength of the group holding it, will diminish if it is kept around men who engage in sexual intercourse. Yobo niaiyo are susceptible to pollution. Before an analysis of yobo niaiyo can be presented its appearance and construction need to be examined Several designs of yobo niaiyo are found but all share common features in structure and composition. The actual pearlshell is often smaller than ordinary pearlshells 319</page><page sequence="12">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea but otherwise is no different except for being more perfect - more symmetrical, with the finest, smoothest gold-lip * skin' - and for the addition of a white sliver of pearlshell, centrally mounted on the bottom lip of the pearlshell crescent. The pearlshell is mounted on a stiff board of 'tapa' barkcloth, pue, which is extended from the 'horns' of the shell to form an elliptical shape, the pearlshell being one half of the ellipse, the barkcloth the other. Tia, or Job's Tears (Coix lachryma-jobi), hard greyish-white seeds, are set into the barkcloth half, either completely covering it or arranged in lines which create symmetrical patterns painted with various colours (combinations of black, white, red and yellow). The rim of the tia half may be finished off with a woven vine edge, and special leaves are attached to the join between this half and its opposite - the pearlshell, which is rubbed with red ochre (see Hg.2). Figure 2: Yobo maiyo. 320</page><page sequence="13">Clark Yobomaiyo is a complex material representation, but of what? Informant exegesis sheds some light on whatyobo maiyo ' means' . The whole construction, unlike ordinary pearlshells, is gendered It is said to be aroa , female. The tia half is thought to resemble a woman' s skirt, yei, and the sliver of pearlshell, stuck on with sap from the wiru tree which is coloured with red ochre, is called tine, the * child' of its pearlshell 'mother'. As with ordinary maiyo, the bottom lip of the pearlshell is its * head' , its horns are its ' legs' , the iridescent surface is referred to as a 'skin', and the back of the shell is described as its 'stomach'. The pearlshell, like people, has a body, tigini, with external and internal dimensions. The tage leaves which cover the point where the ' legs' of the pearlshell enter the ' skirt' , are a sign of wealth. They indicate that the yobo rnaiyo will attract much wealth, just as tage leaves are numerous on the tree. Yobo rnaiyo, then, is symbolic of a female body wearing a skirt, and with child Ordinary pearlshells represent the androgynous bodies of pearlshell donors, but in the yobo maiyo case the body is explicitly female, even though this pearlshell is the epitome of * male' wealth. Yobo rnaiyo, despite its gender attribution, is also compared to a fighting shield - which it resembles in shape - for the owner group, as it indicates the strength of the group and the fact that other settlements will ' fight' to possess it. Unlike ordinary pearlshells, yobo maiyo are susceptible to pollution from sexual intercourse. The tine of the pearlshell is said to be sensitive like the nose of a dog hunting marsupials, in that it can 'smell' if men have had coitus recently. A woman' s body and a war shield are two interpretations of yobo rnaiyo, another will be discussed below. Pace Turner (1967:50), from the exegetic level of symbolic ' meaning' , the analysis now proceeds to the operational level, except that this 'meaning' does not emerge from its ritual context. The skirt, yei, is partly composed of tia, Job' s Tears, which were worn as mourning necklaces, tia yei, and, before the arrival of cowry shells, sewn into men's headbands. The skirt, however, does not represent a mourning skirt but an attractive skirt worn by unmarried women which makes men want to see their vagina, for the pleasure of which they have to give valuables in bridewealth, just as a group has to give a lot of valuables to obtain a yobo maiyo. Nonetheless, the use of tia suggests the skirt has connotations of death, while the pearlshell half has a ' child' . That is, life and death are opposed and conflated with each other within the unitary framework of yobo maiyo. That death is a motif of the skirt half is supported by the fact that, pressed flat between the barkcloth and the layer of tia and paint, and covered with wiru sap, are the woven vine leg bands of a deceased headman (leg bands are only worn by men of wealth and status). This is done to promote the memory of the deceased' s name, and to remind his kin to avenge his death by warfare, poisoning or sorcery. For all the 'femaleness' of yobo maiyo, male elements continue to enter into its 'meaning'. Red and black, two of the colours which may decorate the skirt, are associated with men, although women do use them in self-decoration (which is on the skin, the male part of the body). At the sensory pole of meaning (Turner 1967:28), yobo maiyo as symbol refers to the physiological fact of life/procreation and death. The shape and position of the ' child' on the crescent, embedded in a similarly shaped but overlapping bed of red ochred wiru sap, evokes the vulva (see Hg.2). The pearlshell sliver, the ' child' , suggests that the crescent plus sliver, ' covered' by its opposing woman' s skirt, is itself a representation of the female genital region - a front-end view of an exposed vagina (that Highlands sexual symbolism is often explicit and unambiguous lends credence to this claim). The sliver is said to be the most valuable part of theyobo maiyo, and may refer back to a time when pearlshells existed not as whole crescents but in the form excavated in the Yuat 321</page><page sequence="14">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea gorge, as remarked above. The Yuat slivers were probably worn on the head, through the nose or ears, just as the tine is located on the head, the male part, of the pearlshell. The latter is also a glistening white colour - the colour of semen and breast milk - and stands out starkly in its vulva-shaped bed of reddened wiru sap. As remarked above, semen is analogously at the edge of the pearlshell, which raises the question of why the vulva and child are located on the rim of the pearlshell associated with maleness. This part of the pearlshell is itself multivocal, just as the red colour of the ochred rim is 'male' but also refers, through the bed in which the sliver rests, to the redness of womb blood (the sharing of which provides an idiom of descent). To return for a moment to regular pearlshells, the habitat of the beetle larva and its colour equates the tobe rim with femaleness. Tobe, however, also refers to growth rings or markings which are found on trees, bamboo and the penis (all ' male' ), as well as on the larva (see Fig. 1). The 'head' of the pearlshell, naturally yellow, is whitened with wiru page, which turns black, to be finally reddened with ochre. The transformation in colour, shape and texture not only signifies the interdependence of bodily substances, but their cultural appropriation to the process of individuation. Sexual symbolism in Pangia is rarely exclusive, one gender containing and referring to the other in a mutually self-signifying process (M. Strathern 1981:681), as the opposed rims of the pearlshell indicate. Why not, in fact, compare the sliver to the penile aperture? The tine is said to act like a nose in smelling coitus, the nose and the penis being the only external, singular and central organs of the body. The striations (growth rings) on the skin of a pearlshell are compared with those on the tip of the penis, and with the nodes on bamboo and trees. (In the Female Spirit Cult, pearlshells were displayed in association with phallic-shaped cult stones.) The tine sliver has the most value because what women produce - children, instigated by semen - are the source of wealth and exchange relationships. At the ideological pole of meaning are the social and cosmological implications of this fact, which I hope to demonstrate below. At a social level, for instance, yobo maiyo is the shield of agnatic groups and a source of their power.2 Its very shape and the complementarity of its two halves - the pearlshell and its skirt, constituting a woman - suggests not just the opposition of life and death but a cycle of death and regeneration, in fact social reproduction. This may be why maleness and femaleness, semen and vulva, are conflated, not opposed, on the sap covered rim of the pearlshell. Yobo maiyo is a representation not of an individual woman but of a womanness which transcends the contradiction between life and death. It conflates rather than stresses oppositions, unlike ordinary androgynous pearlshells which are required to mediate between people and their 'female' source. It is only women who can 'grow' and nurture bodies and transmit the substance necessary for their constitution.3 This is why a 'female' shell is required to encompass the relationship between groups and the spiritual forces which are responsible for health, fertility and growth. In this sense yobo maiyo are more like cult stones than wealth, the former also stored power, existed as group icons, and were susceptible to pollution. It is only women who are complete, men are dependent on them for reproduction and their labour, yo&amp;oflia/yo refer to this fact, which is mirrored in sty les of architecture. Men's houses, containing weapons, decorations and cult objects, are open-ended and U-shaped, like maiyo; women's houses, containing food, children and pigs, are closed and elliptical, like yobo maiyo. During ceremonial pig-kills an elliptical longhouse constructed in the style of connected woman's houses, and encompassing men's houses, surrounds the ceremonial 322</page><page sequence="15">Clark green. For the duration of this phase of the cult cycle the green becomes a 'female' space into which male recipients of porksides penetrate, and where sacrifices and ritual take place to ensure fertility and reproduction. Wooden poles from the tibu cult houses, hung with the bones of sacrificed animals, are removed and vertically erected on the green. Yobo rnaiyo is complete, it is the shape of an egg, nut, out of which in myth all human life originated (cult stones of the tapa patrilineal cult house are mw, testicles, and semantically there is a strong correspondence between eggs and testicles, which is linked to concerns of fertility. The similarity between yobo rnaiyo and cult stones has been commented upon). Marilyn Strathern (1981:676) suggests that * value put on womanness is not necessarily to be equated with value put on woman' even though, for Wiru, 'womanness is valued as reproduction, manifested in its own products' (ibid:680). This is why Wiru women relative to Trobriand women, for example, are not valued by men for their contribution to reproduction. Trobriand men acknowledge the central importance of women in regeneration (A Weiner 1976), women having high status and the ability to publicly exchange wealth items, banana leaf bundles and skirts, which are analogues of items used by men. Wiru women make and gift skirts and netbags but these are not the equivalent of ' male' wealth, nor do they have their own public exchange events, although women do take part in men' s events and can, of their own accord, initiate exchanges with men. Wiru men appropriate womanness for their own purposes, andyobo niaiyo gives symbolic expression to this fact. There is, however, much more to yobo niaiyo than this expression. We need to look at it in closer detail to unpack further ' meaning' . The whole construction is ' female' , a woman with child, wearing a skirt. Yet the skirt, composed of wild tia seeds, is more strongly associated with women, it is a product of their domestic labour and, insofar as it covers the vagina, it indicates sexuality and reproduction (the leaves of the tree fern against which pearlshells are often displayed are analogous with women' s skirts [cf. LeRoy 1978:67]. The crown of a tree fern is said to be like a vagina). Pearlshells, by contrast, are the products of male labour in public exchange, or at least mystified as such insofar as all pearlshells are inextricably linked into the context in which women naturally reproduce bodies. The interdependency between male and female labour to produce children, and the conflation of public exchange with domestic labour which ultimately ensures social reproduction, is another facet of 'meaning' in yobo niaiyo. It is not being suggested, by stating that the skirt is made from wild seeds, that skirt: pearlshell : : f emale:male : : nature: culture, rather that nature and culture are not separate domains but constituted within the person, for whom woman is a metaphor (M. Strathern 1981:682). The word yobo is only used, as far as I could ascertain, in two other cases. Women, especially brides, are said to be irono yobo, ground}' obo, and pearlshells are ai yobo, 'up' or sky yobo (cf. LeRoy 1978:62 ' [Kewa] men and their shells are associated with things of the above' ). Here we have an opposition of yobo in terms of high and low, again contained within the yobo maiyo, which is both 'woman' and pearlshell. 'Woman' is the ground in which things are planted and grown, while men ideologically control the 'high' spiritual domain in which the power of fertility, manifested by the rain which fructifies crops, is located (Kerr 1987:104). Yobo rnaiyo, a 'female' pearlshell, encompasses the relationship between groups and spirits, land and sky (internal and external), and death and life. This pearlshell, through its association with groups rather than individuals, is not so bound by the ambiguities of gender and is identified as 'female' as a comment on the origins of wealth through female reproduction. By being an ultimate form of wealth yet ' female' , yobo tnaiyo is transcendent 323</page><page sequence="16">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea of these ambiguities. It refers to unity not difference insofar as it relates to the underlying female constitution of people and wealth. We have not yet exhausted the symbolic potential of yobo rnaiyo. The barkcloth base, pue, which underlies both skirt and shell, is made in a labour process to which both men and women contribute. Pue, in its use by both sexes as covering for warmth and protection from the rain, encloses the body. Decorated barkcloth boards, similar to the gema boards of the Kuma and Siane (Reay 1959; Salisbury 1965), are worn on the heads of men on exchange and cult occasions. Barkcloth, in its beaten processed form, covers the body (constitutionally female), and when rigid is used by men in head displays. This relates to the context of its gifting, to be discussed below. The skirt is composed of a dead man' s legbands which are pressed flat and overlaid with wiru sap, into which tia seeds are set. As remarked above, the sap from the wiru tree is called page, the same term for semen. The bark of the wiru tree is used to make pouches for pearlshells, and its seeds may be compared to pearlshells (LeRoy 1978:58). The pearlshell as female body has a child attached to it, also by wiru page. The skirt construction is analogous to the positions assumed by men and women in sexual intercourse, partners face each other and the woman removes her skirt and sits on the man's outstretched legs, rhythmically encouraging ejaculation. The up and down motion perhaps parallels the sky and ground connotations of yobo maiyo. Page/semen as the mediator appears again, between a woman and her child, in the pearlshell construction. Semen is the initiator of life, producing a baby grown in the woman which is externally attached to her at the breast or slung from her back in a netbag. The female skirt is overlaying, through the medium of wiru page, a dead man' s legbands, and this has been compared to the position assumed during copulation. The equation of sexual intercourse with death needs to be elucidated Through sex and the birth of children is initiated a life-long transmission of pearlshells, representing the paternal individuality of the donor, to a person's maternal kin or to his wife's brothers. This has consequences for men. First, the loss of semen in sex presages the aging process which culminates in death. Secondly, and more important, a man's involvement as recipient in life-cycle payments increasingly identifies him with the ' female' source of reproduction - the maternal substance which builds bodies. To quote from Marilyn Strathern (1981:681), the paternal individuality of fathers is * swallowed up in a more generalised and feminised parenthood' , that is, a daughter5 s children 'obliterate' the paternity of her father. This 'swallowing' is indicated by the complete superimposition of the female skirt, composed of items used in mourning, over the dead man' s (the symbolic father?) legbands. Sexual relations which create a man' s children lead to the gradual extinction of aspects of his agnatic maleness. The association of yobo maiyo with death refers to this, but it is also transcendent. At death the internal is rendered external, that is, a man's bones remain after his flesh decomposes. It is death which releases a man from the obligations and ' swallowing' of matri-exchange, rendering him a fully individualised person (free of 'femaleness'), such that his skull can be stored in the patrilineal cult house. It is perhaps a combination of all of these things to which the death aspect of the skirt refers, men become less ' male' as they grow older and, by association, more like women, as well as being, in some cases, dependent with little wealth or status. Female over male is also an inversion of the natural order of high over low, manifested in the genderised layering of the internal and external dimensions of people and pearlshells. Death is a negative consequence of this inversion. 324</page><page sequence="17">Clark That y obo maiyo is 'female' and is given between groups suggests similarities with a bridewealth transaction (aroa can also mean 'wife'), and people say that this pearlshell is 'female' because it attracts many valuables as does a bride. The gifting oiyobo maiyo by groups rather than by a 'father', overcomes the problems that the loss of a daughter has for her father. It is 'bridewealth' in a political, non-kinship context. Yet even at this level relationships are constructed as if they were between wife-giver and wife-receiver, the logic of body payments informing all exchange in Pangia (see Clark 1985:319). The positional dimension to symbolic meaning (Turner 1967:50) can be considered here. When presented to a group, a single man from the donor group decorates himself and marches out from hiding behind a stand of pit-pit. He turns his back to the recipients, holding they obo maiyo over his genital area. He then turns to face and walk towards the recipients, holding thtyobo maiyo up over his head (as decorated boards are worn on the head). The donor then retreats coyly, with his back to the recipients and the pearlshell returned to his groin. This performance is repeated many times until the y obo maiyo is finally handed over. There are several elements to be analysed in this ceremony. The coyness and 'teasing' of the donor resembles the actions of men at ' singsings' , in which they display themselves to women to provoke later assignations. A sexual overtone is present in holding the pearlshell, a woman's body with skirt, and with child, over the donor's genitals, and is perhaps a statement of the superiority of the donor group, which treats the recipients, the 'wife-takers', as 'women' . M. Strathern (1981:681) suggests that the Wiru bride is, in a sense, already with child before sexual relations with the groom. Brides and y obo maiyo, which are like brides in their exchange between groups, have a parthenogenic aspect. There is also a movement from low to high, from the genitals (associated with abea, dirt) to over the head, from a parody of the act of sexual intercourse (abele toko, dirt do) to the holding up of the ' shield' of the group. The low to high, ground to sky theme can be seen as supporting the death and regenesis motif oiyobo maiyo. This ceremony, then, can be linked into the operational dimension of symbolic meaning. Contra Turner, the meaning of y obo maiyo as symbol is not tied to its ritual manipulation, it is more the reverse. A penultimate interpretation will now be considered, which is thatyobo maiyo represents the head of a decorated body. For what it is worth, when colleagues are shown this pearlshell they invariably state that it is a face or mask. Pearlshells do have a head, tobou, and are described as the head of all things. The Job's Tears embedded in the skirt pre-date cowrie shells as items used in headbands. A decorated face, with a pearlshell worn on the chest, does bear a marked resemblance to thtyobo maiyo (see Fig.3). This pearlshell is also described as a ' shield' and, in the Hagen area to the north of Pangia, the designs painted on shields are 'very similar to those painted on the face' (Strathern and Strathern 1971:103), and shields have a 'head' (ibid.). If this interpretation of y obo maiyo has any validity, then the head which it depicts is genitalized, reminding one of the Baubo statuettes of ancient Greece which consist only of legs, vulva and head (Ardener 1987: 121). In Pangia, as in other Southern Highlands societies, exposure of the genitals is insulting but can be powerful. A woman' s exposed genitalia can weaken or deflect sorcery attempts, and sorcerized men would sleep using their wives' skirts as pillows. The genitals can shock, they have power by drawing attention to the source of life and death (through pollution, loss of substance). This helps to account for the description oiyobo maiyo as the shield of a group, as it insults and terrifies the enemy, and can kill them as a lethal gift (Zeitlin, quoted in Ardener 1987:122, describes how the Medusa, another genitalized head, was displayed on the shields of Greek warriors). 325</page><page sequence="18">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea Figure 3: A 4het kina' from the Anganen area. Photo: L. Merrett Bridewealth is given for children, and yobo niaiyo is symbolically with child, suggesting one last interpretation of it in terms of a significant cultural item. The yobo ivaiyo 'child' is carried on the female body of the pearlshell in a position analogous to that of a baby carried in a netbag, kaf which this pearlshell resembles in shape. Yobo ntaiyo is a woman with a skirt and child, a netbag is the only essential item missing from what constitutes 'woman', and it is not such a leap of imagination to make this claim. Also, netbags are used to carry valuables between wife-taking and wife-giving groups, which creates tracks, also known as ka, between them. The netbag is a symbolic womb in which food, children and wealth are carried It is indicative of nurture and reproduction (cf. M. Strathern 1981:674) and, while not important in exchange except as a means of transporting pork and pearlshells, its function can be parlayed into symbolic value. The netbag, like the skirt, is a symbol of womanness. Writing of Hagen netbags, Marilyn Strathern states 'as symbols they represent ... the restricted lives of women ... the womanness they embody is not conflated with clan continuity and social regenesis' (ibid.). Wim skirts and netbags do not have the importance in exchange of Trobriand woman's leaf bundles and skirts but, unlike their Hagen counterparts, at least one of these possessions of Wiru women is identified in yobo niaiyo, by men, as a prime symbol of regenesis. Yobo niaiyo as the 'bride' exchanged between groups comments on processes of reproduction, not in terms of individuals and the connections between them, but to the reproduction of relations which constitute society. It enables the continuity of groups, 326</page><page sequence="19">Clark achieved through the exchange of ordinary pearlshells, by ensuring the conditions for this exchange, namely access to the resources of men and land Yctyobo niaiyo exchange is more than an everted form of bridewealth, as it reifies the 'female' source not only of people but of regenerative power in the cosmos (cf. Clark n.d). The similarity in shape between yobo maiyo and a netbag supports statements made about its representation of a cycle of death and regenesis. The netbag, made by women, is an elliptical 'whole' which carries children, wealth and harvested vegetables. Yet ka, as defined by a Wiru linguist, refers to the 'life principle of people and plants, which has almost run its full course' (Kerr 1987:108). The pearlshell, the female body, has its skin covered with red ochre, 'the reddening of the skin (ka yoroko) ... [signifying] that death is immanent' (ibid.:112). The 'child' is a pure white sliver of shell embedded in redness, and is the most valuable part of yobo maiyo, signifying new life out of death. ' Netbag' ,' woman' and ' shield' refer to organic process, reproduction and the group respectively. Yobo maiyo, as a dominant or core symbol, contains all of these references within it, although it may be more appropriate to write of this pearlshell as a unified field of meaning. Maiyo gifting marks the progress of individuals through their life-cycles. Yobo maiyo celebrate the continuity of society in a developmental cycle of life and death. The former mediate between ego and maternal kin, who 'gave birth' to ego, and pearlshells take on qualities from this mediation. Maiyo are androgynous but they often have a 'name', that is, a ' male' history . Yobo niaiyo encompasses the relation between society and the spirit domain, the 'female' source of cosmological power. Wiru say that men create (lariko) pearlshells as God created people. Women, by contrast, do not create, they merely give birth (opiko). Yobo maiyo derive their power as symbols from the uniting of creation and reproduction into a cosmological whole. Yet it is still an artefact of man, created to suggest that male control of creation and reproduction is possible. The most valuable pearlshell, yobo niaiyo, does not have a name. It has no history. Maiyo refer to continuous or processual time, diachrony, in which people are replaced, and hence to the irreversibility of organic process. Yobo niaiyo refer to an atemporal continuity, synchrony, which is assured by women giving birth to bodies which, like pearlshells, will receive the imprint of history. Synchrony relates to the structural continuity of society and of oppositions between life and death, male and female, which persevere regardless of historical events and the demise of individuals (cf. Gell 1975:338). Yobo niaiyo, as a symbol, is out of durational time,4 and is a concrete representation of the 'female' locus of social regeneration. Yobo niaiyo is 'culture in a netbag' (the phrase is Marilyn Strathern's). PEARLSHELL SYMBOLISM - A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE Sillitoe (1979: 143n.), the ethnographer of the Wola, writes that (t)he symbolism of a pearlshell, and other valuables, interested me but no Wola ever ventured an exegesis. It is intriguing to ask, for example, why they cut the muscle mark of the mollusc from the shell and make it crescent-shaped, or why they favour a red colour. It is too easy for the anthropologist to offer an imaginative explanatioa.. I hope I have demonstrated that there is some value to an 'imaginative explanation' as long as it is well grounded in the symbolic logic - the categories by which people make sense of the world - of the culture, even if this logic has to be represented, and to some extent reified, by the anthropologist. Yobo niaiyo is not an arbitrary construction, it has to ' mean' something. The 'meaning' of symbols is often untranslateable from one domain to another, for example, 327</page><page sequence="20">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea from the visual or performative to the exegetical. What this paper has attempted to demonstrate is that this 'meaning* has been built into yobo maiyo, and that there is a certain untranslatability between constructional and exegetical meaning (cf. Gell 1975:213-14). The actual process by which a cultural logic becomes incorporated into material artefacts, by their makers, has something of the mysterious about it, but no more than that of the artist who can capture on canvas what cannot be expressed in words. As Healey (1990:312) comments ... value in use and exchange relates not to obvious and observable material and social ways in which trade goods may be manipulated but to [the] highly abstract and elusive symbolic and aesthetic 'values' of things, which derive a potency precisely because their manipulators [and makers] cannot articulate or consciously reflect upon them. It is now appropriate to return to a consideration of the connection between aesthetics and exchange valuables, namely to the claim that pearlshells were first adopted for aesthetic reasons and not because of the strategic, maximizing activities of big men attempting to monopolize scarce resources. Sillitoe (1979:156) remarks that the increased supply of pearlshells after pacification did not, for the Wola, devalue pearlshells because of their high * aesthetic value' , although it was ' not possible to explain why the aesthetic tastes of the Wola have developed as they have' (ibid.:l52). Hughes (1977:201) writes that For species [of marine shells] to be elevated to the role of principal ornaments and supreme valuables, they probably had to be remarkable in size or beauty and to remain in relatively short supply ... once a shell type achieved a special role in the ritual of social relations, its value was further enhanced and protected It should be made clear that my use of 'aesthetics' does not refer to personal or idiosyncratic appreciations of qualities perceived in pearlshells, but to an aesthetics informed by underlying cosmological principles. Even these qualities, such as durability and iridescence, did not by themselves lead to pearlshell acceptance on the basis of novelty, rather the argument is that they appealed to pre-existent cultural values. Pearlshells, perhaps, did not so much achieve 'a special role in the ritual of social relations' as display features which made them more appropriate for this role than previous valuables. It is possible to suggest reasons why aesthetic 'tastes' may have developed for certain valuables. Healey, in a recent publication, provides some support for this argument, bearing in mind that pearlshells probably did not reach his fieldwork area in the Jimi valley much before the 1920s (1990: 190) The appearance of permanence [in shells] has, I believe, an aesthetic appeal also, in a world where other of man' s things are given to decay ... Thenew shells ...presented a merging of aesthetic qualities that were formerly manifested in quite different objects: durable but dull, bright but ephemeral (ibid.:290). The nature of the items which shells replaced as valuables used in exchange lends credibility to this claim. Hughes (1977:198) states that 'the long-term supplanting of ornaments made from plants, birds, and land animals by ornaments of sea shells [is] well evidenced' . These items were bird plumes; animal fur and teeth; the fruits, seeds and leaves of trees and plants; and pieces of cassowary shell (ibid.:202). It was the living world of nature which supplied wealth and items for self-decoration. This world provided images of growth, renewal, sexuality, colour and death (for the last, the wild is a domain of ancestors and ghosts). Pearlshells were incorporated into this imagery, and lent themselves more readily to the symbolic expression of certain cultural themes. Writing of Maring marriage, Healey suggests that shells were more appropriate than plumes for bridewealth, which is an exchange meant 328</page><page sequence="21">Clark to initiate a lasting relationship. Plumes, bright and iridescent like shells, fade and disintegrate, while the latter 'are hard, strong, bright, and durable, both physically and metaphorically' (1990:312). The Kewa, neighbours of Wiru speakers, metaphorically associate pearlshells with the seeds of the wiru tree, and with mushrooms and bird feathers (LeRoy 1978:58-59). The Daribi people of Mt. Karimui refer to pearlshells by the same term used for bird's egg, ge (Wagner 1986:58). Both Wiru and Wola people of the Southern Highlands compare pearlshells with the bracket fungus which grows on trees, and Wiru informants claim that it was once thought that this was how pearlshells were grown. For Wola, this interpretation is linked to an origin myth, with pearlshells being found growing like fungi at places where an unmarried girl had hit a tree with her stick (Sillitoe 1979:302; cf. LeRoy 1985:123, for another mythical association between women and pearlshells). References to pearlshells growing on trees are common in the literature (see Williams 1977:315; Wagner 1978:66), and cuttings from the pearlshell tree were asked of the first European explorers in the central Highlands, who traded pearlshells for labour and food (Simpson 1954:47). Writing of pearlshells among the Kewa, LeRoy (1978:63) states that they are evoked by tree fruits, parrot feathers, and celestial bodies. They are like tree fruits because of the association between tree trunk and men, because both are aggregate entities, and because tree fruits are sought by birds the way shells are sought by ghosts. Pearlshells resemble the features of certain parrots because of their irridescence (sic) and red colour, and because men are likened to birds. Finally, pearlshells are like the stars or the sun because they shine even in dark interiors or glint with the reflected light of the sun. Pearlshells have a celestial referent for other Highlands societies; for Wiru they are associated with the sky, for Wola with the red dawn (1979:162), for Foi with the sunset (Weiner 1988:48), for Daribi they are the sun and moon (Wagner 1986:59), and Melpa compare pearlshells with the moon (Wirz 1952:68). Pearlshells are linked, through this cosmological symbolism, into a complex of beliefs about cycles of growth, fertility and reproduction. Wiru ritual specialists would scrape the ground with a pearlshell while uttering spells to improve soil fertility, and to increase pig populations. These incantations include references to the sun and moon, which Wiru believe control the agricultural cycle. The pearlshell, for Melpa, 'has a purely religious and ceremonial significance in its use in the Kor Nganap ceremony [associated with creation and the life principle] and the final stages of the moka ceremony' (Vicedom and Tischner 1983:135, 150; cf. Wirz 1952:67, where he describes Melpa pearlshells as 'quasi-sacred' objects of veneration, with a mythical precedent for their use in ritual). Clearly, pearlshells had a significance greater than that of 'power tokens' in exchanges between men. A consideration of the historical and linguistic evidence, slender as it is, sheds some light on this statement. Nonetheless, what follows is necessarily speculative. The Kewa were on the main trade route of pearlshells into the Southern Highlands, and it is possible that it was in this region that the beliefs surrounding pearlshells were symbolically elaborated, beliefs which were perhaps passed on with their trade and exchange. Franklin's Kewa dictionary refers to the nmdupa tree, the seeds and leaves of which 'were used in ancient traditional exchange' (1978: 181, 230). Mudu is a term for shell and pig (ibid.), although Franklin makes no comment on this linguistic correspondence, or on whether /nwdw/shell is derived from nmdupa. This sort of evidence is by itself inconclusive, but Franklin provides other intriguing linguistic clues. Yaba-puluae was a carved wooden 329</page><page sequence="22">Pearlshell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea crescent, made from the eya tree, with a fragment of pearlshell set into its centre with pitch (ibid.:246). According to Franklin, this construction pre-dated pearlshells (I assume he is referring to whole crescent shells). If this claim has any validity, the crescent shape was important before the arrival of pearlshells, such that their initial appeal related to an already established symbolic and aesthetic preference. Franklin (ibid.) defines y aba (not yaba-puluae) as ' an important pearlshelF but unfortunately provides no other evidence for linking y aba to the Wim yobo, although given the centrality of Kewa in the shell trade it is not too much to suggest that Kewa terms and ideas about pearlshells were passed on to the Pangia area (where Wiru elaborated and substituted their own symbolic details). It is less likely that this transference was made in the opposite direction, that is, from Wiru to Kewa. Puluae appears to derive from pulubia, 'to break into pieces' (ibid.:206\ such that yaba-puluae means ' a piece oiyaba* . The reference is perhaps to the value and scarcity of pearlshells before they became more readily available as crescents, such that pieces were metonymically attached to wooden crescents (and, contra Franklin, suggests that Kewa had some knowledge of the crescent form of pearlshells, which does not detract from the argument that the crescent was part of an aesthetic appreciation of form). Yabala is a type of red mushroom which grows on hardwood trees, of which eya is one variety (/Wd.:134, 246). The connection between mushrooms, trees and pearlshells (for yäbala and pearlshells, see LeRoy 1978:58) has already been established, and it is possible that yabala provided the etymology lor y aba and ultimately yobo and, in its crescent shape, for the aesthetic of form into which pearlshells were fitted. Again, it is the wild which provided the imagery and symbolism into which pearlshells were incorporated, and the context for the linkage between men, wealth, 'things of the above', and regeneration. Yaba-puluae, a wooden crescent with a fragment of attached pearlshell, bears a marked resemblance to the pearlshell half of yobo inaiyo, as well as to examples of 'het kina' found in other parts of the Southern Highlands (see figure 3). It may be a symbolic ancestor toyobo maiyo. I did observe a similar construction to ayobo maiyo, said to be of Kewa origin, in the Pangia Catholic mission. Unfortunately, I was unable to ask any Kewa about this pearlshell, and none of the Kewa ethnographies refer to it. What seems likely is that in the Southern Highlands, at least, there is a complex of beliefs about pearlshells which has been barely considered, and that the symbolic focus of these beliefs is to be found in the Kewa area, if perhaps most elaborated among the Wiru (although this may be the ethnographer's conceit). That pearlshells fitted into a pre-existent aesthetic, as suggested above, is supported by claims made by Wirz (1952:67) about Melpa valuables before pearlshells. He states that people in the Mt.Hagen area had wooden discs, later supplanted by pearlshells, which were ornamented and painted on one side; they could be owned by individuals or clans. Wirz compared them to the 'churinga' of Australian Aborigines in that they contained a supernatural force. Interestingly, Melpa mounted pearlshells on round boards made from applying tree resin to the back and sides of the shell, with the whole construction being reddened with ochre (A. Strathera 1971a:238). This suggests an aesthetic continuity between the wooden discs and pearlshells. Wirz (1952:68) asserts that Melpa connect pearlshells with the moon, although in its roundness and colour the moka pearlshell more closely resembles the sun. Yet red is a colour associated with females, and in many Highlands societies the moon is linked to women, menstruation, death/pollution, fertility and growth (see e.g., Biersack 1987:155).5 330</page><page sequence="23">dark There is ethnographic evidence from the Mendi area, however, of a pearlshell which closely resembles yobo niaiyo. This is the nioniak sonib (Mawe 1985:32-41). It is the sonib designation which interests us, nioniak being the term for pearlshell. R. Crittenden (pers. comm.) reports a type of valuable pearlshell, from the Nipa area west of Mendi, cdlledyomp. Nihill (n.d) describes an Anganen pearlshell - from the Kewa-influenced region to the southwest of Mendi - with a mounted fragment known as yanibo. The'b' inWiruandKewa is pre-nasalised, such that y aba and yobo are pronounced * y amba' and 'yombo'. Given that Mendie languages drop the final vowel, it is more than conceivable that yanibo, yonrp, and sorrib are part of a complex of beliefs about pearlshells which extends, with local variations, from Pangia to the area west of Mendi. Somb, like the Anganen yanibo, refers to a small piece of white pearlshell attached to a pearlshell crescent with resin. Mawe (1985:32) describes it as ' once the most prestigious item in Mendi society' , the equivalent of 48 pearlshells. Ryan (1961:60), who worked with Mendi people in the 1950s, writes of an ornamented wooden plaque, unfortunately not described, called a shontp, 'which was formally paraded on public ceremonial occasions to indicate a clan' s wealth' . It had not been used for about a generation at the time of his fieldwork. The shomp was important when pearlshells were much scarcer (ibid.), and was perhaps the Mendi equivalent to the Kewayaba-putuae, as well as recalling the wooden discs of the Melpa which were also replaced by pearlshells. The nioinak sonib is joined to a wooden crescent called the soìrìbti, with a pattern of Job's Tears set into it, when it is about to be displayed (Mawe 1985:39). Its similarity ioyobo niaiyo is remarkable (see the photograph following p.105 in Mawe). The nioniak sonib j oined to ihzsonibti may be a symbolic synthesis of the ornamented woooden plaque - the shonip - and a pearlshell, just asyobo niaiyo appears to be a merging of ayaba-puluae type of construction and a pearlshell (it is possible that shonip and sonib are the same word). The sonib, Yiktyobo niaiyo, is owned communally rather than by individual men, and its caretaker, who had to follow certain taboos before visiting the sonib, was an influential and wealthy man (ibid.:35, 39). It was 'the visual expression of an intergroup treaty for cooperation ... [serving] as a symbol to hold [clans] together' (ibid.:36, quotes transposed; cf. Lederman 1986:85-6). Like yobo niaiyo, sonib was not used in bridewealth or ordinary compensation payments (ibid/AO). Mawe (ibid.), himself a Mendi, emphasises the role of thesomb as a'symbol of clan unity andsocial solidarity', and in a contemporary andintriguing allusion compares this role to that of 'today's [provincial] premier, in that he had to make sure that certain things were done the right way, in the right manner, and at the right time' (ibid/Al). One would be hard put to find a more evocative symbol of power, group identity, and status in the Southern Highlands than that of premier! Mawe does not provide any evidence which could be used to compare yobo niaiyo and sonib in terms of gender symbolism and cosmology. His data do, however, suggest that Wiru are not atypical or aberrant in terms of pearlshell semiotics. The wooden disc, shonp, was replaced by what Ryan (1961:60) calls 'heirloom' shells, or moniak win. They seem to be in some respects similar to nioniak sonib, to which he does not refer, yet Ryan describes them only as large shells of superlative quality which are not used in individual exchanges, and rarely in inter-group exchange (ibid.:61). Sillitoe (1979: 143) refers to comparable 'veiy fine' pearlshells among the Wola, niowniaek hul, '(lit: pearlshell bone - that is strong and everlasting shells)',6 which men do not constantly use ... in exchanges. The owners of these shells keep them hidden away. In a society where the mark of a successful man is to manage (not 331</page><page sequence="24">PearlshellSymbolisminHighlandsPapuaNewGuinea store) large amounts of wealth it is ironical that the owners of most valued shells rarely give them away. Sillitoe (ibid.) proposes that 'hoarding' may be a symbol of a man's success at wealth management, although this does not explain why these pearlshells are kept hidden. I would suggest that this Western notion of 'hoarding' obscures the significance of the 'everlasting' aspect of ' bone' pearlshells which, likeyobo maiyo, may be related to the way they symbolize the structural continuity of society. The 'bone' in this instance perhaps refers to male continuity and lineality, expressed through the bones of male ancestors kept in cult houses, and opposed to the 'flesh' created by women (cf. J. Weiner 1988:120). Ryan (1961:58) states that the ownership of momak win is ideally at the sub-clan level,7 and reflect its prestige. This pearlshell is not generally circulated as currency, its main significance is that of a wealth symbol which is worn by members of the owning sub-clan at full-dress dances, death compensation parades, and pig-killing parades. On such occasions ... a momak win indicates that its wearer, and hence, his sub-clan, is so rich that he can afford to have at least 8 or 10 shells permanently out of circulation; it is the Mendi equivalent of hanging a Renoir in the kitchen (ibid.:6Q). Both Sillitoe and Ryan, I believe, over-emphasize the importance of heirloom shells as a symbol which is 'hoarded' as wealth, or paraded as status, or at least miss a dimension of its 'meaning' through this stress. These pearlshells are symbols of group prestige and rarely exchanged, they transcend the categories of wealth and secular exchange and have an almost religious significance. While momak win and mowmaek hul bear some similarities with momak somb, the evidence suggests that they are not the same thing, but rather a pearlshell which shares attributes of the latter with regular shells . They were repositories of group power and a link to the cosmic forces of regeneration, which found their apotheosis with constructions such as the momak somb. The fact that heirloom shells, somb, and yobo maiyo are hidden and kept out of circulation is an important element of their meaning, and to explicate this we will examine some beliefs about pearlshells held by the Foi and Daribi people. Wagner (1978, 1986) was the first anthropologist to seriously consider pearlshells as other than items of political or economic utility, and demonstrated their role as a ' core symbol' in the constitution of Daribi culture (1986:58-60). Daribi know pearlshell by the same term used for bird's egg, ge. (It has already been remarked that one of the items of wealth replaced by pearlshells was fragments of cassowary egg shell, although there is no evidence that this was the case for Daribi.) There is an analogy between the life cycle of egg-laying birds and the exchange of pearlshells for the bodies and reproductive abilities of women. In effect, the 'eggs' [pearlshells] of human beings are immortal - they move externally and opposite to the flow of human reproduction, causing it without ever hatching, whereas birds produce their 'pearlshells' out of their own bodies, only to see them destroyed in the production of offspring. People reproduce against the flow of their immortal ge: birds reproduce by moving through their mortal ge (Wagner 1986:58, emphasis in the original). As is the case with other examples given, the wild provides the context for Daribi pearlshell symbolism and, significantly for the argument of this paper, its importance is not merely as wealth but as a 'procreative metaphor' (ibid.:59) in the cosmic scheme of reproduction - 332</page><page sequence="25">Clark 'humanity is immortal only through pearlshells' (ibid.:65). Pearlshells are not only 'eggs', they are the sun and moon, which make possible garden growth and hunting (1978:65). Clearly, pearlshells fitted into an aesthetic of form * suggestive of a sphere' (ibid)9 or at least a circle. In Daribi myth, human beings were once immortal, and pearlshells were found in association with crocodiles, an egg-laying animal species which - along with insects, fish and other reptiles - is also considered to be immortal (Wagner 1986:59, 61; 1978:66). Wim have a comparable myth about human immortality, and trace human origins to the wadai spder, which carries its own egg/mw around with it, out of which new life emerges, and which sheds its external 'skin' to emerge renewed The spider is also known as rnu kakokali (egg stand-man), and is associated with gardens rather than the bush; to harm the spider is to threaten male potency. Although the concept of/?»/, like Daribi ge, is closely related to Wiru notions about the cycle of life and death and central to notions of human origins (Kerr 1987: 109), people made no comparison between pearlshells and eggs in my presence, perhaps because a major referent for nut is testicles and cult stones rather than bird's eggs. Yet pearlshells and beliefs centred around imi are part of a cult complex concerned with health, fertility and growth, and their connection best illustrated by iheyobo rnaiyo which, ' suggestive of a sphere' and treated like a cult stone, provides a symbolic blueprint for the creation and continuity of Wiru society through marriage and the flow of wealth. The Foi people of Lake Kutubu also describe pearlshells as eggs, although in this case as 'male eggs' (J. Weiner 1988:86). This brings to mind the 'bone' pearlshells of the Wola, northern trading partners of the Foi (see above), and the ' maleness' of mu in its manifestation as cult stone. Interestingly, Daribi pearlshells, like regular Wiru maiyo, are ungendered (Wagner 1986:48), perhaps for similar reasons given the correspondence between Wiru and Daribi life cycle exchanges (cf. A. Strathern 1971B). Ma' mm, the Foi term for pearlshell, can mean ' anything' , perhaps even ' all things' : This ambiguous semantic reference, the use of nta'ame to signify both the pearl shell and anything else, the particular thing of value and all things of value, embodies the precise meaning of pearl shell for the Foi (J. Weiner 1988:63). The Foi usage of pearlshell to signify ' everything' captures the sense in which this paper has tried to convey what these objects mean to members of the societies discussed (although 'value' is not to be understood purely in the sense of wealth). The pearlshell is a part of everything - exchange, marriage, reproduction, notions of cosmic power - which makes life meaningful to people. Its flow enables human sociality (J.Weiner 1988:279). For Wagner and Weiner, what defines the essence of pearlshells is their movement, ' they move externally and opposite to the flow of human reproduction' , like immortal eggs. A Foi myth poetically conveys this definition (iMrf.:279-82). An unmarried young man goes in search of pearlshell hearts, demanded by his prospective affines. During a canoe trip downstream he is unable to find pearlshell hearts, and is instead offered only crescents which belong to men and are (temporarily) stationary. He continues past the last human settlement and comes to a place where the river runs underground, and where he observes the reflection of brilliantly red objects under the water. He meets a handsome young man, near a place of beautiful red ground, who takes him to a place where he hears sounds like birds. The air is in fact full of flying pearlshell slivers, circling around stationary pearlshell hearts above the heads of the men. These hearts were speared by the handsome man, and proved to be ' truly 333</page><page sequence="26">Peaiishell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea beautiful, unflawed, beautifully red, perfectly round, uncut pearl shelP (ibid.:280\ which the other man took back to his settlement to use in bridewealth. Weiner equates the 'heart' of the pearlshell with their essence - 'that they must continually move from person to person' (ibid.:282). He quotes Wagner (1978:69) to the effect that pearlshells 'have no source, for they pass ideally from person to person in a never-ending rhythm of human marriage and procreation' . In the Foi myth, dealing as it does with unrealized possibilities in social life (Lévi-Strauss 1976), pearlshells have a definite source, and the ' hearts' are in fact stationary, although surrounded by flying, pitted and broken pearlshell 'skins'. Weiner uses the technique of symbolic obviation to render the stationary hearts as a metaphor for the flow of pearlshells, their essence. While Werner's argument is convincing, I must confess to being more comfortable with an interpretation of the heart which stresses its immobility not movement, and which returns us to a consideration of heirloom andsomb type pearlshells.8 These objects are exchanged, if infrequently, but in fact resist movement. Their essence is not to be passed around in exchange but to be permanently stationary. Pearlshell hearts are round, the perfect form, and exist in nature in association with bird-like and celestial attributes. Yobo maiyo and its ilk refer to an ultimate, complete form of control and power, which entails the end of exchange and flow. As long as exchange continues it will be the crescent, a human and imperfect construction, and not the sphere which moves.9 The 'suggestion of a sphere' is a promise of a kind of perfection. Yet exchange will persist as long as men are dependent on women for production and reproduction. Heirloom-type pearlshells symbolically deny this dependence by indicating that non-movement is possible, even desirable. In other words, they suggest that men control the pearlshell 'heart' - the power of reproduction, what J. Weiner (1988:86) calls 'procreative continuity' . The self-containment or symbolic closure of constructions such as yobo maiyo suggest that men and their pearlshells have the potential to partake in a mutual parthenogenesis. In other words, to appropriate an ability which women - Wiru women, at least - possess naturally. Fundamentally, what th&amp;yobo pearlshell promises is an illusion. A not totally unexpected implication of the above is that pearlshells objectify, in a durable and concrete form, semen. Pearlshells, like semen, are detachable from the male body - although for Wiru they are also a form of body 'caused' by semen, as the numerous uses of page in pearlshell construction would indicate - and men pass them around in a process of social and cosmic insemination (cf. J. Weiner 1987:72-3). Exchange becomes a fecundation of the world This equation of semen with pearlshells is not original, and ' speaks ... to the symbolic elusion of human and social reproduction in indigenous discourse' (Lindenbaum 1984:355). For the Bedamini people of the southern Highlands fringe, semen is ' the essence of life' (Sorum 1984:322), and in male initiation involving ritual insemination a male dancer has a pearlshell crescent, both called ' new moon' , tied to his beard and a vulva painted on his chest (ibid.:323). The pearlshell represents semen/life in a process by which males ritually acquire characteristics of male and female genitalia - as if they were self-contained, self-reproducing entities, independent of women.10 This style of bodily decoration calls to mind the design, 'meaning', and symbolic closure of yobo maiyo (and contemplate again Fîg.3), namely for the connections both establish between head, phallus, semen, vulva and regeneration. As Lindenbaum (1984:351) implies, semen and shells are analogues of each other in sister exchange (fringe) and bridewealth systems (Highlands). The former involves exchanges of substance which reproduce the social order, the latter an exchange of wealth: 334</page><page sequence="27">Clark 'the shift from semen to shells records, objectifies, and is an instrumental turning point in the appropriation by men of the sexual and social labors of women' (ibid.). A turning point, perhaps, but the Bedamini 'new moon' dancer and the yobo maiyo indicate a symbolic continuity between ideas associated with semen and shells in the fringe and Highlands proper.11 That it is semen exchanged between men finds its clearest expression in those fringe Highlands societies which practise ritualized homosexuality to ensure male growth and social regenesis (see Herdt 1984). One argument is that bridewealth systems are a transformation of this cultural logic. Semen, however, is a living substance, a bodily product. Pearlshells are produced by the actions of men but ultimately have an external source (although Wim do perceive this production as a creation). This source is at one level foreign, the 'end of the earth' (A. Strathern 1971:235), and at another located outside the male lineage through ties of affinity or alliance (the 'female' names of Melpa pearlshells refer to intergroup alliances based on marriage, a form of alliance less pronounced in Pangia, cf. M. Strathern 1981:679). Nonetheless, ordinary maiyo are of neutral gender, they are non-reproductive. Their androgynous constitution equates them with seeds which do not germinate, me poko, which is a metaphor for the hermaphroditic condition. Melpa pearlshells may be said to be 'dead' - 'it dies, it dies, and lies still' (A. Strathern 1971:237). Franklin (1978:230, 240) records a 'heavy' Kewa pearlshell called sekere wai, wai being the term for an immature, that is, non-reproductive, female animal (size and weight, the' heaviness' of a pearlshell, are criteria by which it is appreciated and valued, cf. Sillitoe 1979:142). Regular pearlshells, like semen, cannot by themselves produce life - they are 'dead', without a vital force. Mendi people think of pearlshells ' as having the reproductive capacity to "beget" other shells in exchange' (Lederman 1986:85), but they still need the actions of people in exchange or cult performance to animate them, to imbue them with power, just as semen by itself cannot create or animate the foetus (and even the Gimi require a female vessel for the foetus to grow in). Semen and pearlshells are envisaged as being directly produced by men, even if pearlshells have an external source (the amount of semen and shells in circulation remains the cause of much male anxiety). The latter have to be manipulated to be able to 'do' anything in public, ceremonial life, and until then they have to be kept hidden, tightly bound and wrapped, in the gloomy recesses of men's houses, as if their fragile and transient vitality has to be protected and conserved. This attribute of pearlshells compares strongly with male fears about semen depletion, and both items are subject to a kind of 'resource management' through which men demonstrate their strength and control. Yet once shell not semen, object (however fetishized) not bodily fluid, is exchanged between men, the transaction becomes one step removed from 'natural' process, hence the ' dead' aspect of pearlshells. This is one of the diacritical differences between sister exchange and bridewealth societies, although as has been made clear constructions like yobo maiyo are attempts to create the pearlshell as a 'living' entity transcendent of the limitations of objects. Its susceptibility to pollution, like people, indicates the extent to which it is conceived as having an existence, a power, in its own right. CONCLUSION Pangia people name themselves and their language after the wiru tree, the hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). It supplies the bark covering for pearlshells and is an important male symbol, associated with male residence and achiev ement, and renowned for the hardness 335</page><page sequence="28">Peaiishell Symbolism in Highlands Papua New Guinea of its wood Informants compared its 'hoops' with the striations or growth rings on bamboo and the penis. Wiru sap is used in pearlshell construction (by the Wola also, Sillitoe 1979: 146) and is analogous with semen. The seeds of Araucaria, metaphorically associated with pearlshells, have, unlike other conifers, bilateral membranous wings. They bear a resemblance to Ixet kina\yaba-puluae and the pearlshell half oiyobo tiraiyo. The hoop pine was symbolically important for Wiru before pearlshells arrived, and perhaps the pearlshell shape which, in respect oiyobo maiyo, refers to the vulva, semen and reproduction, resonated for Wiru and other Southern Highlanders with the image of the wiru seed, out of which new growth (and maleness) emerges. Could it be that the crescent shape, with its evocation of seeds and vulvas, was part of an aesthetic which pre-dated pearlshells? Did pearlshells fit into a cosmic scheme of regeneration, a series of resonating images between wooden crescent and attached shell (yaba-puluae), tree and seed, man and detachable semen, and pearlshell crescent and attached Figure 4: The wiru seed sliver (yobo maiyo, lhet kina' , somb)7 I suggest that pearlshells became the ultimate symbols of fertility and growth, and derived their importance as wealth items used in exchange as part of a cosmic balancing act in which men, particularly big men as ritual leaders with religious power, resisted entropy and brought order to the world, thereby ensuring its reproduction. Battaglia (1983:302) writes of the Sabarl Islanders that, with respect to the exchange of ceremonial axes (i)t would seem that by involving themselves in sexual, political and spiritual exchanges people on some level envision supernatural control and, ultimately, their own immortality in the objects they manipulate. This fits well with what Wagner has written about Daribi pearlshells, which this paper has attempted to extend into a general argument about their symbolic significance in the Highlands. Battaglia (ibid.:289) refers (via Malinowski) to Stendahl's definition of beauty as 'the promise of bliss'. Pearlshells, at one level, are a promise of immortality but, in constructions such as yobo maiyo, offer a vision of the end of exchange, the possibility of a world of parthenogenic men.

The reviewer for Oceania made many useful and insightful suggestions for improving the article, as did colleagues at Adelaide and James Cook Universities, and where possible corrections have been incorporated into the text. I wish to thank all of these institutions and individuals. Any errors in the analysis remain the author's responsibility. 336</page><page sequence="29">Clark NOTES 1. The reviewer for Oceania points out, quite rightly, that a complete analysis of pearlshell aesthetics, as opposed to pearlshell symbolism, is missing from the article, and that until one is presented claims of original acceptance based on aesthetics rather than exchange value remain of the 'chicken and egg' variety. In other words, an indigenous aesthetics needs to be elucidated before one can argue for acceptance on the basis of the former. The Wiru pearlshell is a thing of beauty (koniyo), but is its beauty a product of its use in exchange or its intrinsic qualities? This will have to await further analysis, and it is hoped that the article will stimulate research and debate on the pearlshell - as artefact and microcosm - which will address and clarify some of these issues, leading to a more substantial monograph on the topic. 2. Yobo maiyo have so much power that, if given as a lethal gift, not only will children in the recipient settlement die, but also some in the donor settlement. The ordinary pearlshell which is stored in the space left vacant by a gifted yobo maiyo, will absorb some of its power and increase its value. This pearlshell is known as the 'brother' of the, yobo maiyo (cf. Ryan 1961:59). 3. There is no flow of male substance from generation to generation within the descent group. 4. Yobo maiyo do, of course, have a diachronic dimension. They record a man's death, and are given in events which occur in processual time. No symbol can escape history. 5. Photographs of Melpa pearlshells from the 1930s (see Connolly and Anderson 1987:253), when com- pared to those from the 1960s (see A. Strathern 1971a, opp. p.81), indicate that the round resin backing had become substantially larger. While this is intriguing, the literature offers no explanation for this aesthetic elaboration. 6. 'Bone pearlshells' among the Anganen were often those with a mounted sliver oiyambo (Nihill n.d.). 7. Sillitoe (1979: 143) implies that 'bone' pearlshells are individually owned, although this may be a distortion induced by his overly individualistic interpretation of Wola society. 8. In a variant of this myth collected earlier by Williams (1976:315), the young man follows a scrub turkey, an egg-layer, to a grove of red-foliaged trees, where pearlshell fragments lie scattered about like leaves, and is taken into a house to be given whole pearlshells. The latter are stationary, like the 'hearts', but in a more ordinary sense, that is, they are stored in a house as are regular pearlshells. 9. The Melpa, of course, managed to combine the crescent with the 'suggestion of a sphere' in their moka pearlshells. 10. The Sambia also equate semen with shells (Herdt 1984). Bimin-Kuskusmin, ideally a sister exchange society, explicitly compare cowrie shells, male wealth items, with the vagina (Poole 1981:143). This is similar to the gendering oiyobo maiyo as a reflection on the ultimate source of wealth. Regardless of comparisons between shells and semen or vagina, these examples are 'variations on a sociosexual theme' about the connection between reproduction and wealth. 11. There is not the space to discuss the relevance or merits of an 'evolutionary' perspective on the transition from sister exchange to bridewealth systems, that is, from exchange systems based on substance to those based on wealth.
