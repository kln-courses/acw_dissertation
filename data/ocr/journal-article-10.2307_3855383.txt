<plain_text><page sequence="1">(57) THE KING OF EGYPT'S GRACE BEFORE MEAT By A. M. BLACKMAN THE relief and two adjoining texts with which this article is concerned are to be found in the second register on the inner face of the northern section of the girdle-wall of the great temple of Horus at Edfu.a So far as I am aware these two texts, the longer one of which refers to the creation of Shu, have never been translated, despite the fact that they were published years ago by von Bergmann,b and that the longer one in particular contains featuresdents of the ancient Egyptian religion. I therefore venture venture to present readers ofournal with the urnal with the following translation and commentary, in the course of preparing which I had the good fortune to be able to discuss by correspondence various grammatical and other points with Professor Gunn and Mr. H. W. Fairman. Their helpful observations will be duly acknowledged in the following pages. The above-mentioned texts and the legends attached to the figures in the relief are published in Chassinat's Le Temple d'Edfou,c vi, I52-7, and an admirable photograph of the relief itself is reproduced in E. xiv, pI. DLVII.d The Berlin Academy photographs Nos. 100-2 show not only the relief with its legends but the two adjoining texts as well. A collation of these photographs with Monsieur Chassinat's printed versions of the legends and texts did little but provide evidence, if such be needed, of his accuracy as a copyist.e DESCRIPTION OF THE RELIEF. The King, Ptolemy XI, wearing the hmhm-crown, offers a tray, upon which are laid two trussed ducks and various joints of meat, to the sacred hawk of Edfu temple, accompanied by Horus of Behdet, HJathor, and Harsomtus. The sacred hawk, whose cult Fairman and I propose to discuss fully in a later article, stands on a serekh placed immediately in front of Horus of Behdet, who is seated on a throne and holds the i-emblem and \ -sceptre. Behind Horus stands Hathor, her right hand uplifted in the gesture of protection, followed by her son, the youthful Harsomtus. Above the last-named divinity hovers the Winged Disk, one wing extended horizon- tally and the other hanging vertically, while from the Disk itself depends a single uraeus. Behind the King is the Queen, Cleopatra III, making the same gesture with her left as Hathor is making with her right hand. She is crowned with a diadem com- posed of two tall plumes 2/ combined with a pair of cow's horns ', between which is set the solar orb. a See Porter &amp; Moss, Top.

The numerals in the translation placed in square brackets denote the pages and lines in Chassinat's publication. 2. See JEA XXIX, I7, n. e; xxx, 79, under Additions and Corrections. The title is here assigned to the King whom the relief represents as filling the role of the sacred hawk's priest. 3. i, which is quite clear in the Berlin photograph (- E. XIV, pl. DLVII), must surely be a mistake of the sculptor or scribe for b 1 b; n ntr; see E. VI, 157, 2 legend D, 2, below, p. 58, where the sacred hawk is designated 'his (i.e. Horus of Behdet's) b', though a designation much more frequently assigned to it is b; n Rr or b; rnh n Rr, E.

II, 9, I2, the sacred hawk is the b; of Harakhti, while E. vi, 299, 7, speaks of 'Rec and his living b;'. I must confess that there is an objection to my emendation in the fact that the expected determinative J or &gt; is lacking; see many of the above-cited references. However, the writing . b;w does occur, E. VI, 157, 2; see also III, 339, 9; 351, 6. 8. For the episode in the daily temple-liturgy entitled 'Bringing the God to his repast', see Blackman's art. Worship (Egyptian), I, 5 (3) in Hastings, ERE XII, 779'; also E. VI, 305, 2; Blackman, Meir, III, 29, n. iI; Junker, G6tterdekret, I9-20. With the mnt b;(?) n ntr r sbw.f of our text cf. M. 46, 23-24. 4. See below, n. i6. 5. For a useful note on ssr 'sacrificial ox' see Sethe, Dram. Texte, IIo, 8a. In dis- cussing this particular passage, however, Sethe, not realizing that &gt; is the determin- ative of S;b-swt (cf. E. III, I, 13; V, 7, 8), treats it as an ideogram (reading the sign as bik?), translates it 'Falken', and makes it the subject of the following pseudo-verbal clauses. For other occurrences at Edfu of the word ssr in similar contexts, see E. I, 565, 3; Iv, 284, i6; v, i65, 5; VII, 73, 5; 148, II; 316, 5; 3I7, 4; D. IV, II, I. 6. The word F w L ' is not cited in Wb. II, but see E. III, 193, II; VII, 81, I4; 82, 2; 124, I I; also Fairman, Ann. Serv., XLIII, 270, n. xliv. Sethe, loc. cit., translates the word 'V6gel' without comment. 7. A common name for the temple of Edfu, e.g. E. I, 568, II; 569, 7; II, 9, I3; 19, (36); IV, 286, 13; v, i65, I3; VI, 5, 6; 319, 5; VII, III, II; VIII, 161, IO. 8.

As will be seen in the forthcoming article by Fairman and myself, to which reference is made below, p. 70, there is plenty of evidence to show that the 'balcony' (s?d) on which the sacred hawk was exposed to his worshippers was situated, as at Philae,a above the gateway of the pylon. 17. The sacred hawk's priest, the hm gmhsw, impersonated Shu; see n. 8 of this Commentary, and for the gesture, n. 9. i8. Restoring l[,]; see E. vi, I56, 14. 19. If, as I have supposed, I is a writing of - s;ty,b Shu and Tphenis must be meant. See also E. viii, I46, 5-6, where it is said of the Behdetite 'he guideth all men to his territory, their father is he, they are his twin-children (~~). In this passage mankind seems to be regarded as the offspring of the sun-god and equated with Shu and Tphenis, the first created beings; cf. Gardiner, PSBA xxxviii, 93. Fairman has sent me an interesting note on , which he felt inclined to read rhty the 'Two Damsels', i.e. Isis and Nephthys, suggesting that i has been wrongly substituted by the scribe or sculptor for the ibis-sign, which often reads rh, and referring me for the correct writing to E. v, I90, I2. He preferred rhty to spty because the protection of the god or king is one of the chief functions of the 'Two Damsels', see E. I, 45, 4; 384, 8; IV, 245 I 4-15; v, 194, 2. With regard to the variant writings of the word for 'Two Damsels', normally rhty (Wb. II, 44I, 6), he informs me that he can prove beyond all doubt that h usually read msnty (Wb. II, 17)44, 7), is actually to be read rhty, and he furthermore states that the parallels clearly show that rty r4ty. For this interesting phonetic phenomenon see our joint article in YJEA xxx, 21, n. 41 of the Commentary. After further reflection, however, and in view of the parallel phrase in E. vi, 107, 9-10, sw m gmhsw k. r hr nih h i hmf hr [ir(t)]c sf, where s;ty seems much more likely than rhty, Fairman has come to the conclusion that my reading of jl I in E. vi, I56, 5 may be right after all. 20. Reading kr ir(t) si'k, - preceding 9 purely on calligraphic grounds. 21. See Wb. v, 376, 5; E. iiI, 65, I5; vi, 101, 2; 104, 7. 22.

If this were so ( would probably have been determined by z or i (see Wb. v, 212), though this is by no means an invariable rule; see, e.g., E. iII, 3, 13; IV, I10, 12; v, 4, 7; 7' 3. However, the Egyptians' love of a jingle in phrases of this kind (see, e.g., Pap. Bremner-Rhind, 26, 2I-2), and the passage E. viii, I46, 5-6, favour my reading of A rather than Sethe's, as does also Berlin Hymn to Ptah, 3, 1 = Wolf, ZAS LXIV, I8, (I9). 23. Possibly to be read twt.k here and not hiwt.k; see Wb. v, 338. I think I can see in the Berlin photograph a trace of the loop-handle of which is almost entirely lost in a crack in the stone. 24. Do these words, presumably addressed to the officiating king, mean that Horus will safeguard him from the guilt of partaking, all unwittingly, of the flesh of a sacred animal ? I can instance no other example of s; ntr used in this sense. 25. A common name for Edfu temple. 26. Lit. 'making his sacred bird (rwtf) stand up (as king)'. For rhr 'stand up' as king see Sethe, Dram. Texte, 32, n. a; 34, n. c. In the passage E. vi, 93, 10-I, the transitive verb shn 'install' is used, in conjunction with hr nstf 'upon his throne'. For this verb see also E. VI, 102, 3-4; 187, 3; 263, i; Urk. ii, 37, 4-5. I2; 50, 12. Fairman thinks that ~_~~ here and in E. vI, 93, 10; 263, I; 3o8, 2, is to be read not rwt 'sacred bird' but Ikm 'sacred image'. But since i^W, E. vi, 263, I finds a perfect parallel in S E, Junker, WZKM, XXVI, 45, (i6), where the hide-determinative surely postulates the reading rwt,a I still feel that my transliteration and rendering of the group )] are correct. This meaning of cwt is not recorded in Wb. I; for X = : see Bull. Inst. fr. XLIII, 72, n. i. 27. Cf. E. vi, 93, 12-13: 'He (Horus of Behdet) places him (the sacred hawk) upon his serekh in his canopied portable throne (hnt tntt.f) in order to exalt his ka above the other divine emanations (,' 2').' With 1, = b;w cf. J V + pylon-determinative bhn(t), E. v, 4, 2, which Fairman and I now accept as the correct reading against what is said in JEA XXIX, 20, n. b. Furthermore, L as a writing of b; seems to occur again, namely E. VI, 72, I5,b where S so regarded would yield the common epithet of Horus of Behdet, b; tkk, one so likely to be found in such a context. Fairman in a recent letter to me has proposed that we should emend () ? , and suggests that the ancient scribe confronted with two \-signs got confused and omitted the determinative of drty. For ; as a uniconsonantal sign = b, a value derived from its employment as a word-sign for, or a determinative of, be, see Fairman, Ann. Serv. XLIII, 268, n. xxxvii. 28.

BLACKMAN the spelling of the word for table is identical with that of , and 7 being not uncommon Ptolemaic variants of =.a Wb. v, 339 gives =, | , and 1, with deter- minative - or F etc., as variant spellings of T 'table', and E. viii, 154, 2-3 offers yet another variant 7 \3 , which Wb. does not record. Unlike mn-bit, the royal couch, the royal dinner-table is personified, as the determinative j clearly indicates, not as a goddess but as a god, despite the fact that tt is unquestionably a feminine word. As Gunn has noted, Wb. v, 338-9 gives three examples of tt followed by the indirect genitive, spelt 7 every time. Gunn also observes that yet another example is to be found in Devaud, Ptahhotep, I20, second text, where the word not transcribed from the hieratic is certainly 7 1, Ltt, which, he supposes, must be the word tt 'table' in view of the variant in Pap. Prisse which is clearly meant for T. It seems highly probable, therefore, that =| is to be read Tty and is to be regarded as a nisbe-derivative from tt, meaning 'He-of-the-table', 'Table-god'. Do =1 , 7Z and the other supposed variant writings of tt cited above also read Tty? These spellings with final a and t certainly suggest that this is the case; cf., for example, ] W;dty, E. III, 9I, 4, Hsty, a designation of Sopd, E. v, 93, 5, and Jl@ Hstyw, E. viii, I35, 13; cf. also writings of the fem. dual such as f, ~S, s;ty, cited in n. i9 of this Commentary, and the writing of shmty, E. vi, 244, II; see, too, Sethe, Sitzungsb. Berlin, 1934, xiII, 222, n. 5I. Since the sacred hawk's (originally the King's) dinner-table was, when ceremonially employed, personified as a divinity, we may well suppose that the offering- table of any other divinity could be similarly personified and could be referred to in the formulae concerned with the presentation of food either as 'table' or 'Table-god'. In view of the relationship with Shu and Hu assigned to him throughout the longer text it is quite evident that for the purposes of this particular rite, originally the feeding of the King,b "th is identified with Atum, the creator-god of Heliopolitan mythology. In this capacity, for as Table-god he must be duly furnished with victuals, he creates Shu = Hu to supply him with the food he needs. It is, of course, as food-purveyor to the Table-god that Shu acquires the title hry idb = hry wdb, 'Master of Largess', a title not infrequently borne by him in texts of the Ptolemaic period, see below, n. 73 of this Commentary and p. 70. 29. Sethe, Amun und die Acht Urgdtter, 113, n. i, takes the view, wrongly in my opinion, that the verb iss means 'cough up' (husten) rather than 'spit out'. I would suggest in this connexion that iss in issn Sw,c a not uncommon attribute of the officiating King, is equivalent to our word 'spit', meaning 'exact likeness', in such expressions as 'he is the spit of his father'. 30. This rendering of -' I x -X : seems to be the only one that yields any sense as the text stands. The verb di has some such meaning in the epithet d-r 'with out- stretched (or "thrust out") arm', so n d4 s(w) Sw might well mean 'Shu has not thrust himself out', i.e., 'has not ejected himself'. 3I.

II, Belegstellen, 112, 6-8. Since writing this note I have come across some further information about Mrhw in Otto, Stierkult, 7 f. That authority states that the title st Mrh(w) is often borne by Old Kingdom queens, especially during the Sixth Dynasty, citing as an example 'nh.s-n-Mry-Rr, de Rouge, Recherches, 117. Further- more he mentions Ankhnesneferibre&amp; (Dyn. XXVI) and Arsinoe II as being among the royal holders of the title in the late period (op. cit., 8 with nn. 2 and 3). The fact that Mrhy is designated 'lord of Athribis' in the temple of Sethos I at Abydus (op. cit. 8 with n. 5) shows more clearly than ever that he was a Lower-Egyptian divinity. Finally Otto points out that in the late period this god was equated with Osiris and possibly also identified with the moon. 68. Lit. 'in all his body'. 69.

For W4 as a purveyor to the royal dinner- table see what Gardiner has to say, ibid. 88, about such personifications as 'a potential source of food'. The identification of Shu = Hu with Khnum and Ptah is quite understandable, because of the creative powers of these two divinities. Similar powers were naturally ascribed to Hike 'Magic' and also to Thoth in his capacity of the creator-god's tongue; see Sethe, Dram. Texte, 50 ff.; Blackman and Fairman, Misc. Gregoriana, 428. 70.

I, I53, 4) is not infrequently borne by Shu. It was assigned to him owing to his associa- tion with the royal dinner-table and with the food-altars of divinities.a That this title should be borne by important officials along with titles connected with the administra- tion and supervision of land (Spiegelberg, ZAS LXIV, 77, Bemerkung io; cf. D. II, 5, 8) is natural enough, land being the main source of food-supplies; see Gardiner, ibid. 85. As Spiegelberg, loc. cit., points out, the title hry-idb is assigned to Khnum (Famine Stela, 9) and Thoth (Brugsch, Thesaurus, 538, i - E. vii, 247, iO), both of which gods our text practically identifies with Shu == Hu; see n. 69. The determinative of hry-idb seems to be bearded. 74. A name for Edfu temple. 75. Judging from the Berlin photograph a trace of the loop-handle of Z is still just visible. 76.

Some support for this reading and interpretation is to be found in the three following passages: Dd-tw df; r pr(t) C=-7 I A , 'Abundance is the name given to what comes off the altar after diverting that with which the god has satisfied him- self', E. II, 361, 4; Pr-sn im.f [']] CI ^~ , 'They (the priests) come out through it (a particular doorway) [with] the divine offerings after the diversion (there- of), the god having satisfied himself', E, vi, 348, I4; St] df; im.f _ ^ 'The "abundance" is brought through it (the above-mentioned doorway), after the diversion, for distribution by the hntyw-sh-ntr-priests of Him with the Dappled Plumage', E, vii, I8, 4. 78. I can at present cite no other instances of Sakhmet and Edjo being thus designated. 79. The royal title and blank cartouche as well as 'Son of Re(' followed by CPtole- maeus, etc.) in the line below may be survivals from the original form of the 'Grace' as recited by the King. 80o.

Possibly we should read wnmy(t) = 'provisions', a As already stated in n. 65 (see alsoJEA XXIX, 17, n. e; xxx, 79) the hmgmhsw who superintended the feeding of the sacred hawk at Edfu (see below, p. 70) impersonated Shu. 68</page><page sequence="13">THE KING OF EGYPT'S GRACE BEFORE MEAT 'victuals', see ibid., 321, I5.

It looks, therefore, as though at some time or other, through the carelessness of a scribe, these two prepositions had changed places, and I suggest that we should emend accordingly. Only one more small textual correction is necessary, the substitution of j^ for j . That done we have a sentence that yields excellent sense and is completely Egyptian in feeling; cf. lrk. IV, 257, I5; 26o, 12-I3. It is doubtless in her capacity of goddess of pestilence (see, e.g., Gardiner, Notes on the Story of Sinuhe, 32) that Sakhmet is asked to shoot her arrows at 'all the victuals' of those who malign the sacred hawk (the King), the idea of course being that they will thus become unwholesome and productive of disease. 8I.

This latter text has marked affinity with the long litany to Sakhmet, E. vi, 264, 1-269, 7. The feature of outstanding interest in the longer text is that it must originally have been a formula which the Pharaoh was to recite before partaking of a meal. Hence the title of this article. This fact is plainly indicated by the heading and finds further confirmation in the clause sst pw n nsw . . . . wdb (E. vi, 55, 7), the words sst pw n p(Q) rhm inh having been obviously interpolated by the scribe who adapted the text for use in the cult of the sacred hawk. Several Edfu texts make it clear that one of the duties, if not the chief duty, of the Servant of the Falcon (hm gmhsw) was to superintend the feeding of the sacred hawk,a and they also represent him as impersonating Shu when so engaged. Doubtless, therefore, he was supposed to recite this formula when the bird's meal was laid before it. As will be seen in the forthcoming article by Fairman and myself on the cult of the sacred hawk at Edfu at Edfu, a number of royal ceremonies and the formulae appointed to be recited during their performance were adapted for employment therein. A factor that may well have encouraged the priests at Edfu thus to employ such rites and formulae was that, since the Persian conquest, Egypt had been, except for brief intervals, in the hands of foreign rulers. The patriotic Chapter of a great Upper Egyptian fane such as Edfu may well have been more ready to assign the sovereignty over their country to their sacred bird, which, like the Pharaoh of old, was the embodiment of Horus, than to their Macedonian rulers seated in the utterly alien city of Alexandria, rulers who, despite their patronage of the native religion and their adoption of pharaonic titles, must have been regarded as little better than usurpers by the non-Hellenizing inhabitants of the Thebaid, who adhered fanatically to the old religious practices and the old way of life. With regard to the theological aspect of the longer text the two following points seem quite clear. The royal dinner-table, as suggested in n. 28 of the Commentary, is personified as a god, and the god is identified with Atum. In this capacity, in accord- ance with the ancient Heliopolitan teaching, the personified table is represented as spitting out Shu. But here the influence of the Memphite theologians makes itself felt (see Commentary, n. 41), for Shu comes into being, not in the gross manner described in the Heliopolitan myth, but emerges directly from the lips of the creator- god (E. vi, I53, 13) and straightway becomes Hu, 'Authoritative Utterance', i.e. the Creative Word (ibid. I53, IO). As such he produces food of all kinds and his business is to supply the Table-god with victuals (ibid. 154, i f.). Accordingly he is designated 'Master of Largess' (see Commentary, n. 73), the title in secular life of the official who in Old Kingdom times presided over the royal meals, who was in fact the food-pur- veyor to the royal household (see Gardiner, JEA xxiv, 88-9). Since the Servant of the Falcon, whose duty it was to superintend the feeding of the sacred hawk, imper- sonated Shu, and Shu, as we have seen, was entitled 'Master of Largess' (hry-idb), it seems not unlikely that the Old Kingdom hry-wdb in the Mansion of Life (fHwt-Cnh) may also have impersonated that god. a See E. in,ii 64, II; VI, 103, 1-2; 152, I-2; VII, 25, 13-14; 271, 15-i6; viii, 83, 4. 70</page><page sequence="15">THE KING OF EGYPT'S GRACE BEFORE MEAT In two consecutive paragraphs of our text (E. VI, 155, 1-7) the personified table and the sacred hawk (originally the King), having severally satisfied their appetites with the victuals laid before them, are asked in return to assign to Shu, as Master of Largess (hry-idb), food-offerings for 'diversion' (see JEA xxiii, 86 ff.), a request possibly reminiscent of the daily procedure in the dining-hall of an Old Kingdom Pharaoh. Both the personified table and the sacred hawk (the King) are addressed in practically the same words, while Shu, in his capacity of Hu, is identified in one or other of the two paragraphs with Ptah, Khnum, Ws, the hawk's (originally the King's) ka, jHike, Thoth, and Df;, all of whom were thought to exercise creative or/and alimentary functions (see Commentary, n. 69). A further point to notice is that in both the above-mentioned paragraphs Shu is spoken of as 'thy male child in his name of Mrh(w)'. Thus not only the table but the sacred hawk (the King) is identified with Atum. The reason for this may be that, like the table-god, the King himself was regarded as a source of food, which he distributed among his favoured subjects through the agency of the hry-wdb who was equated with Shu; thus the King was placed in the same relationship with Shu as was the table. For the identification of Shu with Mrh(w) I can offer no explanation, unless it be that, like two other bull-headed minor gods, Apis and Mnevis, Mrhw was a purveyor of food to higher-ranking divinities.a Our text clearly represents the result of an attempt to combine and reconcile, in the regular Egyptian manner, two different views as to what happened in the second stage of the Creation, namely after the emergence of Atum from the primordial waters. One is based on an account of the begetting of Shu and Tphenis similar to that twice referred to in Pap. Bremner-Rhind,b the other on a story about the creation or first appearance of Hu, a story more akin to that preserved in a 'coffin-text' published by Lacauc than that quoted from in Chapter XVII of the Book of the Dead.d Without question our text makes it clear that Shu and Hu were closely associated with one another in the minds of Egyptian theologians,e more closely even than Gardiner sus- pected when he wrote the illuminating articlef to which I have so often referred and to which I am indebted for much useful information. The second and shorter text possesses, as already stated, affinity with a litany ad- dressed to Sakhmet (see above, pp. 69 f.). It makes no mention of the sacred hawk's (the King's) meal except in the opening verse, and the rest consists mainly of a series of petitions to the aforesaid goddess, beseeching her to protect the hawk (the King) from his enemies and to destroy them. The text terminates in two verses claiming that the protection asked for has been granted. Why should a formula 'to be spoken by His Majesty when partaking of a meal' terminate in this invocation of Sakhmet, which, as the presence of the royal titles and cartouches indicates, may well have been ap- pended to the longer text centuries before the 'Grace' was employed in the cult of the a See Erman, Beitrdge zur dgypt.

BLACKMAN sacred hawk ?a What in my opinion seems a highly satisfactory answer to this question has been suggested to me by Fairman. He maintains that the keynote of the whole ceremony-certainly of the ceremony in the form preserved to us in the Edfu relief and its accompanying inscriptions-is to be found in the title of the offering-formula, 'Presenting pieces of flesh', which that formula itself identifies with 'pieces of flesh' of the hawk's foes, asserting that they have been cut up in his presence. This view as to the nature of meat-offerings finds expression at Edfu and Denderah in all the scenes bearing the same or a similar heading. If, as Fairman and I think probable, a similar significance was attached to the portion of meat set before the King at the meal to which the recitation of our two texts was the prelude, a view which distinctly finds support in certain passages in the longer text, E. vi, 154, 8-io, then that meal must be regarded as a sacramental ritec the o f which was not merely the satisfying of the Pharaoh's hunger, but, as was the ultimate object of so many Egyptian religious ceremonies, the ensuring of the safety and well-being of his person and of the death and elimination of his enemies.d In this particular case their death was enacted in the preparations for the meal, i.e. in the slaughtering and dismembering of cattle and poultry, their final destruction in the eating of the joints and other meat-portions served up for the royal repast, which thus, it might well be supposed, assumed the character of a triumphal banquet. What favours this interpretation is the fact that it fully explains why the King's 'Grace' includes an invocation addressed to Sakhmet, for one of the chief functions of this goddess was to protect the King from his enemies and to destroy them.e That she should be invited, therefore, to be present and play her part at the enacting and celebration of their destruction appears particularly appropriate. Both texts may well date back to the Twelfth Dynasty or even earlier, for the language in which they are composed distinctly suggests a good Middle Egyptian, possibly Old Kingdom, archetype as the source from which they ultimately derive. As Gunn has noted, the sdm-n-f form retains its past meaning as does also n sdm.f, while sdm.f is employed mostly as an optative. Indeed, the only linguistic' features which are not a It can in any case hardly be doubted that the scribe who wrote out these two texts in their present form regarded them as constituting a continuous whole. b E.g. E. ii, 85, 9-17; 187, 4-12; IV, 128, 17-129, 14; VI, 158, ii-i6o, i6; 312, 13-313, 4; VII, 102, 5-i8; 107, 2-io8, ii.

Texte, p. 130, for the identification at a very early date of the foreleg of an ox with an arm of Seth, and Fairman's and my remark on references in the Pyramid Texts to the dismemberment of that god, JEA xxx, 10, n. i; for the assignment of his disiecta membra to various divinities as meat-offerings see Pyr. ? 1546 ff.; JEA xxx, IO-15. d See YEA XXVIII, 37 f., and ibid. 38 with n. 3. e See YEA xxx Io, with n. e, and certain litanies addressed to Sakhmet, E. iII, 300, 13-301, 6; 303, 4-15; 308, 10-309, 2; 313, 16-314, II; 316, 12-317, 7; 319, 8-320, 4; 322, 4-323, 3; also passages in some of the scenes entitled Shtp Shmt and Hw(t) r r stpwt, e.g. E.

I will conclude this article by drawing the reader's attention to the numerous in- stances of paranomasia to be found in these two texts, especially in the longer one.
