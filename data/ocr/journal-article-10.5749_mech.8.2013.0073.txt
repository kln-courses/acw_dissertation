One manga  from his series on the insect collector Insector, for example, juxtaposes car- toonish human fi gures with detailed drawings of heliconius butterfl ies. Insects  themselves were, according to Kobayashi Junji, the source for Tezuka’s phi- losophy of animation.2 Tezuka once claimed that “the appeal of animation  is that metamorphosis is such an important element of it.” Kobayashi, who  animated with Tezuka for twenty years, suggests that Tezuka sensed the af- fi nity between insects, who transform to achieve maturation, and animation,  which he characterized as based in metamorphosis.3 Insect collecting has long been a passion in Japan, despite the increasing  loss of habitat, and the boys who practice it are called “insect boys” (konchū  shōnen). Tezuka considered himself such a youth. Th e Tezuka Osamu Manga  Museum in his hometown of Takarazuka features a photograph of Tezuka  figure 1 (left).

Indeed Tezuka describes the eyes of his  human characters as inspired by bug eyes. But Tezuka might have just as eas- ily claimed that manga allowed him to draw nature. Th e nature he ultimately  chose to draw did not take the form of his early depictions of insect bodies  lined up in neat vertical rows on a page according to Linneaus classifi cation, a  the metamorphic  and microscopic 75 </page> <page sequence="5"> revelation of scientific order so detailed in their drawing that many claimed  they looked like photographs. Neither was the nature he ultimately drew that  of spermatozoic cells of pond snails and other microscopic objects Tezuka  researched during his medical training. Tezuka, as a mature artist, abandoned  the scientific aesthetic of collection, examination, and painstaking mimetic  drawing of nature for the plasmaticity of the graphic novel.  SACRED SITES Graphic novels, for their capacity to allow for the bending and stretching of  morphologies and line, can generate visually a sense of corporeal possibility.  Scholar of animation and aesthetics Thomas Lamarre, following Eisenstein’s  concept of plasmaticness in animation, calls this capacity for elastic defor- mation and transformation “plasmaticity.” 4 This malleability in form enables  animated characters to oscillate between humanoid and animal being, and a  similar claim can be made for the characters in graphic novels. Plasmaticity  makes possible a visual and narrative rendering of nonhumanist ontologies  because the medium enables the representation of life beyond anthropomor- phic design. Tezuka, the manga artist, takes advantage of the plasticity of  the graphic form to bring to life anthropomorphic animals and zoomorphic  humans. Nevertheless, the narrative world he creates is dominated by asser- tions of absolute species difference and human dominion. Scholar Yomota  Inuhiko has drawn attention to the conflict that abounds among humans and  the panoply of nonhumans, including robots and animals, that populate Te- zuka’s imaginative world. As Yomota suggests, it is this proximate morpho- logical difference among beings that proves the source of the narrative conflict  in Tezuka’s worlds. Regarding the manga Ambassador Atom (1952, Atom taishi),  Yomota writes: “this infinite proximity between humans and extraterrestrials  in Ambassador Atom is what propels the humans’ persistent discrimination  and exclusion of extraterrestrials, in their struggle to maintain terrestrial  order and to confirm their human identity.” 5 Humans achieve their human  identity through the exclusion of others who may be similar to humans but  are not humanoid.  These excluded bodies— especially animal bodies— bravely endure the  anthropocentric tendencies of human civilization, which inevitably destroy  nonhumans. It is not just that morphological difference causes humans to be  prejudiced against them but that human behaviors cause transformations, de- formations. Tezuka’s frequent portrayal of the animal as inevitably sacrificed  76 christine  l .  marran </page> <page sequence="6"> the rejection of the  to human narcissism and struggles for power is  sick and unrecognizable  starkly depicted in Tezuka’s sixth story of Meta- is a continual refrain   morphoze: Story of a Sacred Site (May 1976) in  in Tezuka’s works. which advanced human war technology causes  the deformation of bodies and disruption of  the avian world.6 “Sacred Site” depicts a large bullying bird Goz, who shows  a tiny finch a “sacred place” he has found in the woods. He goes there to roll  in the sand because it causes his body to transform. He is strengthened by  the change. What Goz cannot read is a sign warning the literate (humans) to  “Keep Out: Contaminated Site.” Goz’s “sacred site” turns out to be a contami- nated chemical weapons site, once a war weapons facility. It is littered with  the bodies of dead animals. The finch who had hoped to strengthen himself  through metamorphosis says to Goz, “Can you really metamorphose here? . . .  Everyone is dead! Everyone swelled up and died!” The finch flees. The meta- morphosis that Goz seeks at the sacred site has killed them. Goz, who nested  frequently at the site to take advantage of the transformative strength it gave  him, eventually goes mad. Poisoned by the contaminated sand, his thin bird  body grows hypermuscular, and he becomes excessively aggressive. He is, as  the finch warns him, “no longer bird.” 7  While the birds eject Goz from their tree out of a justifiable fear of his  power, the rejection of the sick and unrecognizable is a continual refrain in  Tezuka’s works. The unrecognizable body, the contaminated one who “is no  longer bird,” for example, is inevitably jettisoned from the community. This is  particularly evident in Tezuka’s manga Ode to Kirihito (1970–7 1, Kirihito sanka).  This lament in manga form features a persistently persecuted half- man, half-  dog hybrid character. This dog- faced man was once a purely humanoid young  doctor, who, in his efforts to cure a strange disease that so deforms its victims  that they look like canine- humanoids, becomes infected with it himself. He  undergoes a slow metamorphosis from human to canine-h uman hybrid and  with this physical change becomes an object of scorn. Despite his learning,  his rational mind, the help he has offered others in his capacity as doctor,  Kirihito is never able to overcome the discrimination he faces after his physi- cal transformation. Confronting such prejudice, Kirihito can only lament his  in-b etween state of being neither fully man nor animal. To Kirihito, his animal  shell means that his interior reason cannot be heard. After being enslaved in  a freak show, Kirihito cries out from his cage, “How cruel of them to use such  learned men in their freak show . . . I am a human being!” The doctor, who sets  out to prove the Monmow disease is not a virus passed among nonwhites as  the global medical rumor has it, goes to Inugamizawa or “Dog- God Marsh” in  the metamorphic  and microscopic 77 </page> <page sequence="7"> the mountains of Tokushima prefecture. The later appearance of a dog- faced  nun, who was originally Caucasian before becoming canine, further confounds  attempts to explain the disease as a virus of nonwhites. Kirihito eventually  learns that other victims of the disease are miners who had been exposed to or  had drunk toxic water that was released during excavations. Tezuka’s portrait  of dog-f aced men huddled in an African mine is similarly a visual lamentation  at the prejudice that would racialize a disease that is the result of ravaging  mining practices. Tezuka’s graphic novel treats Kirihito’s metamorphosis as  an existential dilemma perpetrated by an anthropocentric society that is so  overwhelmed by the visual evidence of difference that it cannot see that its  own environmental contamination has caused that deformation.  The curious irony is the insistent, unsympathetic perspective of Kirihito  toward animals. Even Kirihito’s capacity to exercise reason in order to prove  that the Monmow disease is not a virus but a result of environmental con- tamination does little to convince other humans to treat him with respect,  and Kirihito’s resentment only deepens his insistence on his humanity and  distance from the animal world, even as he violently craves raw meat. The  canine- man comes to hate his physical urges. His desire for acceptance by a  prejudiced human community gets articulated repeatedly through his critique  of animals as inferior. Consequently, while Ode to Kirihito laments the barba- rism of humanity, it champions the return to purely human morphology as  the only way out of speciesist and racial prejudice. Kirihito’s physical differ- ence means that he will perpetually be exiled from the human community,  and his insistent claim for reason based on species difference (that he is hu- man and not animal) ironically means his continued exclusion from human  society. Tezuka’s critique of humanity in Ode to Kirihito is its lament that such  an exuberant humanity cannot see beyond physical characteristics. Never- theless, through Kirihito’s own attitude toward his canine appearance, the  animal is considered inferior in a familiar myth of enlightenment thinking  that worships human rationalism above all else. The doctor, with his rational  mind, is a pitiable figure because he carries the misfortunate weaknesses of  animal passions in a body that invites prejudice. Kirihito’s dilemma is that his  excellent brain is trapped in an animal body. Two volumes of Tezuka’s magnum opus, Phoenix (volumes 10 and 11), fea- ture another dog- faced man, Inugami.8 This protagonist’s deformation is not  the result of environmental contaminants but war. At the start of the volume  entitled “Sun, part 1,” a young man caught on the battlefield of the Chinese en- emy in the seventh century has the skin carved from his face by enemy soldiers  who then place a skinned wolf’s head on his raw face. The wolf’s head becomes  78 christine  l .  marran </page> <page sequence="8"> permanently adhered to his skin. The young man is not able to remove the  face pelt and must live as a half-h uman, half- dog figure on the margins of the  human world. This multiply named, cross- species character, originally from  the Korean Kingdom of Baekje and member of the defeated clan Buyeo Pung,  is forced to flee to the island Yamato after his defeat on the continent. While  Inugami (“Dog- God”) is able to find a position in Japan through his sympa- thetic rescue of a Yamato commander, he remains an outsider not merely for  his rejection of political and religious orthodoxy, but for his face.  Inugami’s attendant is an old woman from Baekje with healing powers.  She insists that he follow his lord’s dictates by accepting the “tides of history”  and directing his people away from faith in native gods who appear as animal– human crossbreeds. She insists, too, that he relinquish his love for a female  dog- spirit Marimo since, as she insists, he is not an animal. Inugami refuses  and cries out his love for the dog- spirit Marimo. In this forlorn cry, he cries  out not just for a dog but for a community of shape- shifters— forest spirits  capable of metamorphosis either by adopting a fully animal form or of trans- forming themselves into hybrid, pointy-e ared humanoids. The jealous old  woman makes a final demand: “You must choose . . . Between me or the female  wolf! And if you choose her, I will have nothing to do with you from this day  on!” The jealous attendant’s passion drives her, as it does Kirihito, to enforce a  rigid distinction between animals and humans. Meanwhile, although Inugami  accepts the shape- shifters as his rational equal, he is not averse to sacrificing  animals to protect the human villagers under his watch. Lord Inugami puts  oxen in the front line in battle, tying them to spiked logs and driving them  toward enemy forces armed with swords and arrows. Inugami, even as he ties  the oxen to their suicidal yokes, still believes that “we humans should be able  to stop this Buddhist invasion through rational discussion,” to which Tsufu,  leader of the Tengu goblins of Mt. Ibuki, replies obliquely, “Lord Inugami . . . I  must tell you that there is no longer any hope of that happening.” 9  Curiously, Inugami is not only animal (not human) and deity (not human)  but also a foreigner in Yamato. His conversation with the princess suggests  that he has an accent. She coyly remarks, “In the language you use, I sense  something sophisticated, even elegant.” Inugami, in other words, enacts hy- brid crossings on a number of levels. He embodies species crossing in his  very skin: he is bilingual, he lies with a human of different ethnicity, and  he also rejects religious orthodoxy. Furthermore, Inugami rejects his lord’s  insistence on Buddhism as the only true religion. He wants his people to be  able to choose between native religion of animal- and monster-g ods and Bud- dhism, or both. the metamorphic  and microscopic 79 </page> <page sequence="9"> The human in Tezuka’s manga alternately hangs upon reason or devolves  into a passionate insistence on absolute species difference. Modernity has  brought reason but also barbarity toward nonfamiliar others. Kirihito and  Inugami’s animal differences that separate them from humans divest them of  any power to be considered equal among humans. This continual separation  of humans and hybrids in Tezuka’s works has led Yomota to ponder why it is  “that nonhumans always have to become the object of exclusion in Tezuka’s  works? Or, to put it differently, why is it that humans cannot maintain even  their basic sense of humanity without being continuously designated as such  by others? Why is it that the moment this act of designation ceases, humans  always lapse into uncontrollable anxiety and eventually chaos?” 10 Even while Tezuka creates highly plastic characters and a visual resem- blance among the humans and nonhumans in terms of scale and line, that  visual overlap of human and animal is continually interrupted by narrative  assertions of absolute difference. Human rationality is considered superior  to all else and becomes the source of anthropocentric pride. The animal hy- brid is still the passionate and irrational in a familiar myth of enlightenment  thinking despite the potential imagination of species-b ased hybridity that the  plasmatic medium of the graphic novel enables. CELLS  It is when Tezuka Osamu returns to the microscopic world of nonanthro- pomorphic drawing that he seems freed from the narrative frame in which  the animal body plays the scapegoat to human dominance. In the “Future”  volume of Phoenix (volume 2), a man named Yamanobe Masato is chosen by  the immortal Phoenix to renew life on earth. In order to understand this  massive task, he is shrunk to the size of an elementary particle so that he can  explore its interior. He remarks to his “Beatrice,” the Phoenix bird, how much  an elementary particle looks like the sun; how cells look like planets; how  the microcosmic world is exactly akin to the macrocosmic galaxy of planets,  which, the Phoenix rejoins, “is only a single cell in a living creature,” which is  the cosmos. In this short interlude, the smallest entity replicates the largest.  What this can mean within the oeuvre of Tezuka is hinted at in the work of  Gregory Bateson, who writes that what constitutes life in its vitalistic sense  is patterns. To understand the world of the living, one must tease out pat- terns among disparate beings and things, which he calls “patterns which con- nect.” 11 Spirals, of a cat’s eye ring, of a conch shell, of a snail’s shell, articulate  80 christine  l .  marran </page> <page sequence="10"> not proximate differences but immanent affinities. An individual being can  even record its own past in its pattern. Bateson’s example of this is the conch  shell. Like the snail shell, the conch shell carries prochronism— its own record  of how, in its past, it successively solved a formal  problem in pattern formation by growing at the  open end, which repeats itself for growth. Bate- It is when Tezuka  son went beyond this to draw different orders Osamu returns to the  of affinity. Writing about serial homologies and microscopic world of  phylogenic homologies, Bateson compared the nonanthropomorphic  crab to the human and the crab to the lobster, drawing that he seems  respectively, for corresponding sets of relations: freed from the  narrative frame in  which the animal body  We could recognize in every leg pieces that cor- plays the scapegoat  responded to the pieces in the claw.

Humerus in the upper arm corresponds to  femur in the thigh, and radius- ulna corresponds to tibia- fibula; the carpals  in the wrist correspond to tarsals in the foot; fingers correspond to toes  . . . The parts of a crab are connected by various patterns of bilateral sym- metry, of serial homology, and so on. Let us call these patterns within the  individual growing crab first- order connections. But now we look at crab and  lobster and we again find connection by pattern. Call it second- order connec- tion, or phylogenetic homology. Now we look at man or horse and find that,  here again, we can see symmetries and serial homologies. When we look at  the two together, we find the same cross- species sharing of pattern with a  difference (phylogenetic homology).12  Bateson’s search for patterns and connections among species and body parts  is a dismissal of humanistic thinking because it denies the possibility of ab- solute difference for any species, including homo sapiens.  Tezuka, too, wrote about patterns that connect. As a youth drawing hun- dreds of insects in perfectly aligned rows, Tezuka was attentive to the tiny  differences among the miniscule insect bodies. He expanded on this interest  in the detailed research he did as an adult. For his doctoral degree, which  he received in 1961, Tezuka studied and wrote about sperm production of  the Japanese pond snail or cipangopaludina malleata— a garden- variety snail  ubiquitous in the rice fields of the Japanese archipelago. In his research of  pond snail spermatozoa, Tezuka used electron microscopes for close-u p  views of sperm cells. The electron microscope allowed a resolution hundreds  the metamorphic  and microscopic 81 </page> <page sequence="11"> the expression of  of thousands times more effective than the optical  ideal form for  microscopes he used as a child.

He suggested that snail sperm is  “not much different from that of a human being. They both have nine spiral  structures, which are visible when sliced vertically. It is true not only of snails  but also of horses and dogs (or any animal). The structure of human sperm  membranes can be very easily speculated by examining a snail specimen.” 14  If Tezuka uses nonhuman species like the robot and the rabbit to describe  the truth of anthropocentrism, he uses the smallest of organisms— the cell,  and the insect, to describe the scientific truth of affinities among organisms  across a broad spectrum.  Thomas Lamarre is right when he states: “although Tezuka’s manga flirt  with the production of such an ideal of the transcendent Unity of Life, there  is no actual social formation or political arrangement that corresponds to the  ideal.” 15 Tezuka does not create a social or political world through his ideal.  But he does suggest that anthropocentric behavior keeps most nonhuman  species from surviving. Even if, as Eisenstein has articulated, plasmaticity  enables the expression of ideal to form, lending “itself to animism and panthe- ism but also to an ideal of Form, as if animation could naturally culminate in  an experience of the unity of all life,” 16 Tezuka saves the metamorphosis en- abled by the graphic novel medium for the “deformed”— the ill, the perverse,  the sick. In Tezuka, anthropomorphic drawing does not create a palette for  articulating cross- species affinities.  Rather, the expression of ideal form for Tezuka requires the microscope,  on the one hand, and the relinquishing of anthropomorphic representation,  on the other. It finds its expression not in the mammalian or amphibious  body in Tezuka’s works but in the cell body. It is the abstract graphics of the  microcosmos that portray idealized form. In Phoenix, the sole human survi- vor, Masato, remarks that an elementary particle looks like the sun, and the  Phoenix replies that it looks like the sun and it also is a sun— a life force in  an indivisible structure. The Phoenix herself metamorphoses into the shape  of an elongated female body, both bird and woman, floating invisibly against  82 christine  l .  marran </page> <page sequence="12"> bright circular orbs, teaching Masato: “If we move onto another dimension,  this whole universe would be no more than one particle. And these together  form something like a cell and the cells in turn form another life. . . . From  the microcosm to the macrocosm they’re all alive.” 17 The particle is a sun, and  the macrocosm reflects the microcosm. Amid graphic dark panels dotted in  large white orbs, Masato becomes immortal to carry on the work of scientist  Saruta to revive various mammals decimated by man who is now described  by the Phoenix as only “a bacteria” upon the earth. These pitch black frames  (beta) with their simple white orbs invoking microcosms and macrocosms, are  in stark contrast to the highly detailed monumental frames of buildings, ar- chitecture, and the world of monumental man- made structures of the apoca- lyptic tale of Phoenix and fascist aesthetics in Adolf (1983, Adolf ni tsugu).  figure 5.

The depiction of affinities among cells and galaxies in later manga and  animation may be a result of Tezuka’s early insect drawings, in which he pains- takingly illustrated affinities among insect bodies. Or his use of formless orbs,  cells, and galaxies to articulate nature and life may relate to his observation  and illustration of tiny snail spermatozoa as a doctoral student. In either case,  it is not as a scientist but as a mangaka— a manga writer— that Tezuka ulti- mately identified not insuperable differences but patterns among organisms. 84 christine  l .  marran </page> <page sequence="14"> Notes  1. Kobayashi, who worked with Tezuka for over twenty years, says that he was eager  to join Tezuka’s company because he was so moved by these early insect drawings.  2. Countless memoirs claim, as testament to Tezuka’s deep attachment to collecting  and documenting insects, that in the absence of red ink during wartime, Tezuka painted  the red of his insect drawings with his own blood. While it may be a matter of taste, a gen- eral consensus has emerged that the most fascinating drawings Tezuka ever made were of  small insect bodies.  3.
