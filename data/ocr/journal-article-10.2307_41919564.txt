S. Marwah &amp; Vinay Kumar Srivastava Department of Anthropology, University of Delhi. In the anthropological works of the formative era, the study of material culture occupied a significant place. For gaining insight into a slice of human life and the way in which social life maintained balance with its habitat, a total study of material cultural objects and representa- tions was considered imperative. And in the famous vade mecum for undertaking field-work, Notes and Queries on Anthropology (1951), material culture received an attention par excellence. But once the British Social Anthropology, largely basing its theoretical premises on the structural-functional approach espoused by A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, emerged as a formidable discipline, the material cultural studies, so well nurtured - though in some cases conjecturally - by the classical periods of evolutionism and diffusionism, and later on, by early functionalism, gradually waned. In the structural-functional anthropology, study of an assemblage of inter-personal relations was more important than that of the discretely various material objects ; and moreover when social structures or enduring groups per se were the provinces of enquiry, culture was but an epiphenomenon of social life.1 At best, material culture was to be regarded an adjunct to the main arena of social enquiry ; and it was believed that it could not be an independent discipline to be investigated in its own right with the ensemble of inter-personal relations being relegated to a subordinate position. If, on the one hand, a dwindle of material cultural studies was not lamented by anthropologists, on the other, some vigorous attempts were made to rehabilitate these studies, not simply at the descriptivè plane, but more in relation to the characteristics of social formation and structure (Sharma, 1983 ; Kaur, 1984). Certain other studies have ventured to isolate some features of structure and value system from material objects. Warner's study of the Yankee Cemetry (1959) is an exemplary attempt in this regard , where he has treated cemetry as a confluence of the living and the dead. Besides the constellation of symbolic arrangements, a cemetry champions the idea that 'we will</page><page sequence="2">¿4 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 not let each other die'. Warner also shows that the living social structure incessantly affects that of the dead : for example, when a family moves up to a higher class stratum, it also gets the graves of its ancestors transferred to the cemetries of the upper or middle class, as the case may be- or what Warner has called 'the bones shall fly'. Besides Warner's path-breaking study, certain works on pottery (Saraswati &amp; Behura, 1966 ; Miller, 1985) and the social organization that enters in their making, have also appeared. The revivalists of these studies, where material culture has been studied in relation with social organisation, have been careful not to suggest a simple descriptive study of material appliances, but to show that a particular complex of institutions yields a particular variety of material culture. In other words, the complex of values, norms and ways of living is at the base of material culture. Following the contour of these studies, which endeavour to rehabilitate material culture in the fast transforming subject matter of anthropology, one needs to examine the relation between material culture and social life at the theoretical level. Surely material culture has been included- and it may seem legitimate- in the canopy of social life, but to do so is to stretch the concept of social life to an extreme where it is stripped off its operational value. To remind, in any scientific study- which of course is differently defined by different people but all agree that it is a systematic pursuance of objective facts - the concepts require to be defined in precise and comprehensive terms to be of heuristic value. With a relationship obtained between material culture and social life at the theoretic plane, we analyse a specific material trait -the Khel gates in a Nagaland village- in its relationship with the social life of people who give (or, to be specific, used to give) a particular array of meanings to it. II Purely for convenience and also for making an apparent distinction between the thought and the reality amenable to senses, anthropologists have divided culture- which to an anthropologist means everything and anything that man makes in order to satisfy his basic, imperative and integrative needs2 and also to achieve aesthetic fulfilment jnto material and non-material. Tangibility and non-tangibility, observability and non- observability, and finality of product and dynamic inquisitiveness have been the dichotomies destined to bring home the distinction between material and non- material. It is interesting to note that these juvenile, if not completely redundant, distinctions divided anthropologists, for some time, into realists and idealists, each submitting solid arguments favouring one vis-a-vis the other. Whenever dichotomies produce dangers of compartmentalization, either a continuum is improvised as a connecting track or both the categories are described</page><page sequence="3">Marwah &amp; Srivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 6Š as complements of the whole. The latter was found to be more suited to material and non-material distinction, as it was arbitrated that ideas, emerging in mind, take shape in material terms and with a progress in production of material things, the original ideas are congruently modified. The relationship between technology and typology is not one of priority, but of complementariness. Undoubtedly this rapprochement was a theoretical advancement, yet it implicitly gave an edge to ideas over material reality. In this the distinguishing criteria of material and non-material remained the same ; the conceptual progress in terms of transformation of the same structure in material and non-material terms remained to be achieved. Ill Material culture is that aspect of social morphology which is amenable to observation and description even when its accompanying social physiology is not known. In this sense it is contrasted to social life which materialises (and thus is open to observation) only when people behave- regularities precipitating in their behaviour disclose the pattern of social life. In other words, social morphology of social life for its manifestation is dependent on social physiology. Further, material culture is the finished or the unfinished, depending on the context, product carved out of the contextually situated materials and resources. It, besides being a corpus of conscience collective, is an embodiment of the mentally perceived design. Thus the reality exists separately at two levels- the material tnd the thought pattern- and both of them are transformations of the basic structure and design of society. But production of material objects is mediated by thought patterns which are always in a dialectical relationship with the material reality ; and as we said earlier, the ideas are transformed to material level and preparation of the objects leads to a sifting and ' modification of the ideas. The relation between material and thought designs can be conceived on lines of the relation between theory and praxis, where on the one hand, theory guides practice and on the other, it develops when out into action. But the dialectics of material and thought designs, which is always vulnerable to the problem of history, is definitely not a negation of the basic structure of society. In other words, the structural themes giving a meaning to social existence may lie constant, but their transformations to material and thought patterns may not only vary in relation to context, but also to time. Material objects may be utilitarian and/or simply aesthetic in nature. Compared to modern society where they are produced in complex factory or industrial situations with a convergence of their designs, in a simple society, an organizational group, which is simply ^ a rearrangement of social structure, is entrusted with this task. Material ^ culture is not secularized and routinized in simple societies, and is</page><page sequence="4">66 Indian Anthropologist [77, Ì987 intimately connected with ideas, beliefs and values of social life. Magico- religious rituals may accompany the making of a material object : for example, the construction of a canoe for Kula expedition is a process where every step from the felling of a tree to its sailing is knitted with magical performances3. Since the simple societies are not as much differentiated as the complex, the construction of these objects is done by the household members, quasi-and part-time specialists, and when the object is an apotheosis of conscience collective , it involves the entire community with roles and duties properly divided. Thus there is a basic difference in the social organisation producing material objects in simple and complex societies. As the folk are gradually being transformed to urban, and as some of their rituals are being adapted to complex situations - thus becoming universalized4 - the material things, being earlier created by folk artists and people, are now manufactured on mass-scale by specialists. In this process, finer qualities of products do come, but they are divorced from the complex of values, sentiments and beliefs, and acquire the character of a commodity. Let us illustrate this with an example. It is customary in Assam to offer a piece of cloth called gamusa , placed on the neck so that it falls forward, to the male guests. It signifies respect as well as love. At the time of Bihu, more particularly at Rangali and Phagali, it, in addition to being gifted to guests, is offered to elderly males, and the gods. Earlier gamusa was knitted by women at the domestic level and often a woman knitted it for ber loved one, but now once Bihu, which traditionally marked the stages of agricultural cycle and the onset of spring is adapted fully to urban situation and functions to integrate people of diverse origins and backgrounds, the production of gamusa is transferred from household to factory. With this, the sentiments and folklore that went in its creation are equally transformed, adapting to a new situation. After gamusa was adopted by the present ruling party of Assam as its symbol in the move- ment, it has become an emblem of cultural and political identity, leaving behind some of its earlier values expressed in amorous and/or ecclesiastical terms. Its design remains the same, although better yarn and finish make the difference, and also the rule of its customary offering - it is gifted to males only. Modernity - bringing in its fold new cultural and political identity- reinforcs the traditional symbols, material as well as non-material, which are often elevated to become insignia of new identity. If modernity ignores them, they are relegated to the background. It is in this dialec- tics of material and thought designs that the meaning of material culture can be discovered. But the question to be investigated is why some traditional symbols adapt so well to new situations and why some others are thrown to the back seat. Or to talk in terms of an example</page><page sequence="5">Marwah &amp; Srivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 67 why has Nagaland kept mithan (Bos frontalis ) head as its state symbol when the right to put its horns on the top elevated structure of the house was confined to one who had given the 'feast of merit' ? The questions of this type cannot be answered in terms of the famous idiom, continuity in change, but require investigation in structural principles of society, which remain infallible irrespective of modernity of tradition or tradition of modernity. Taking material reality as the concrete manifes- tation of a symbol and ideas as the cognitive representation of çoncre- teness, let us see how their dialectics can be understood in structural terms. Our attempt to attribute invariance and also 'infallibility', as the word has been used earlier, to structure seems to contradict the principle of dynamism, which is basic to social existence. It is equally true that structuralists have often been accused of taking an anti- historical stance. As a reply to this, it may be said that reaching underlying principles, the dialectics of which is seen at the level of material and ideational reality, is neither anti-historical nor ahistorical. It cuts across the issues of history - in the sense that the same stiuctural principle is used by the heralders of tradition as well as the protagonists of modernity to sustain either the old society or build a new one. Man's relationships with habitat, other men, natural and cosmic entities, space designs, and the processes that determine life's chances and fulfilment, yield the structural blueprints on which variations of different type are made depending on the availability of knowledge and resources. As the latter is eternally progressive and broadening, one design of social existence differs from the other. At the definitional level, structure refers to a set of elements and the relationship between them which is cut across by history, on the one hand, and empiricism, on the other. It is on this, to reiterate, that the material and thought patterns have a dialectical relationship, one changing the other. At the methodic level, structure yields the common principles that bind human beings enclosed in different spatio-temporal dimensions. And at the epistemic level, structure yields the logico-mathe- matical designs human beings create, recreate, and reinforce, thus expres- sing humanum in relation to other animate as well as inanimate entities. Under the guidance of this working thesis developed between material, ideational and structural reality, we examine a material trait - the Khel gate - in relation with social life of the Angamis. IV The Angami-English Dictionary (by Rüzhükhrie Sekhose), published in 1984, translated the word Kharu, a noun, as rüna kele cha and pra nu kikha, meaning village gate. Akin to the Dictionary meaning, the people define Kharu as a village gate, and in authoritative accounts of the Angamis (Hutton, 1969; first published 1921 ; see pp. 44,45,48,474;</page><page sequence="6">.68 Indian Anthropologist [/7&gt; ¿$$7 Archer, manuscript notes, 1946-8), the gates are understood as of the village. In contrast to this understanding, our study of Jotsoma- a village of the Khonoma group of the Angami Nagas- states that the Angami village does not have a sociological reality of its own; it is a nomenclature used for the aggregation of spatially contiguous units, locally termed as Khels, and the sociological fact is that there is (are) no village gate (s) but it (they) is (are) of the Khel. Thus, Jotsoma does not have its gates; they are of the Khels that constitute it. Every person of Jotsoma shares various levels of identity, each one manifesting itself in a relevant context. He or she is an Angami as opposed to the other tribal groups; is of the Khonoma group as opposed to others of the Kohima district; is a member of Jotsoma as opposed to other villa- ges in the Khonoma group; belongs to a Khel as opposed to others of Jotsoma; is a descendant of a putsano (lineage group) as opposed to others in the Khel; and is a member of a sanyü (sub-lineage) as opposed to others in the same putsano.

Sanyü Although aligning with different levels of segmentation, for an Angami of Jotsoma, the most viable and the most functional unit is his Khel, and his chief concern is to keep alive its unity and vouchsafe its endurance. Precipitation of other identities, like of a village or a group of villages, is a function of shifting concern and context. For an outsider to his village, his Khel membership is transcended by the village identity and he talks in that idiom. Now the gate belongs to the village and is represented in that term ! The importance of Khel in total social organization of the village has not diluted with the fast penetration of development pro-</page><page sequence="7">Marwah &amp; Srivastava ] Uhel Gate anã Social Structure 69 grammes and modernisation. Accruing from one or the other develop- ment scheme, the benefits are distributed according to the Khel divisions. Each Khel has its own development secretary, apart from the one who looks after the entire village, and thus, its solidarity is further reinforced. Having its genesis in the Assamese language, a Khel may be defined as more or less a distinct- spatially speaking- and, by and large, self-suffi- cient -economically and socially speaking- unit of a village. Inhabited by the members of particular lineage groups ( putsano ) which are not found in any other Khel of the village, each Khel has reacted differently to the structure of opportunities provided to the entire village; therefore, the Khels of a village are differentially placed on the scale of development. In Jotsoma, Khel IV, contiguous to the main road connecting Kohima to Khonoma and close to Science College, has a higher concent- ration of urban gains; economic prosperity; education; white-collar workers and politically conscious people than the other Khels which lie in the valley, thus farther from the centripetal forces of development, open networks, and opportunities. Although both intra-and inter-Khel marriages (observing putsano and of course, sanyii exogamy) are allowed, the frequency of the former is more in case the Khel happens to have a higher degree of insulation and closedness with respect to modernisation and its concomitant opportunities. Spatial segregation of the Khels, their differences in terms of putsanos and levels of development , and the presence of barricades, stiff stokades, deep ditches having bamboo spikes, deep lanes, fortified walls, massive fences and huge gates, point to the hypothesis that at one time, before the encapsulating Assamese influence and encroachment of outsiders, each Khel functioned like a small village in itself. Fürer-Haimendorf (1976 : 13) writes : '(Khels) in the old times had often independent foreign policies and settled their own disputes by bloody fights'. When it is hard to maintain distinctions between a Khel and a village, a gate may be regarded as of the small village. In the contemporary administrative structure where relation between the village and the Khel is like between the whole and the part, there are no gates of the village but they are of the Khels and thus, in functional terms, they must be understood as bestowing solidarity and we- ness upon the Khel. And also, this may be recalled that in anthropolo- gical literature (see Hutton, 1969 : 45), the term Khel is interchangably used with clan, which shows that the Khel members trace their descent from thé common ancestor, though clan endogamy may be permitted by adhering to lineage exogamy. The following table describes the Khels of Jotsoma, the lineages inhabiting each one of them, the number of gates each Khel has and their respective names.</page><page sequence="8">70 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 Khel Number PUTSANO KHARU num-Name of the Khel of ber houses in Name Number Name Number each Khel 1.

A large Khel generally has more gates than its smaller counterpart. Area of a Khel is more important than the number of houses it contains. When asked why does Khel -I have three gates when there are less than forty houses, the people say that at one time it had about three hundred houses, but an epidemic seriously depleted their number (see, Joshi, 1986 ; 101). Each Khel has a minimum of two gates, referred to as upper and lower, where the former is close to the way that leads to the town, while the latter takes one to fields. Although from the angle of a village, all gates are equally important, in the orbit of Khel values, a particular gate may score off over the others, or one may be regarded primigenial. Rüsozou Kharus, near the Baptist Church of Khel-IV, is considered by people ^s thç 'all-Thgl0ma tÇhary,' pj- the main gate of the Kbel.

Although standing jejunely, it is admirably looked at by the people whose story of colonisation of this land is intimately tied to this gate. Indeed it is difficult for us to forget the sentiments with which a Khel-I member narrated the significance and worth of this gate. The people of Khel-I look at their gates with a great deal of reverance compared to those in Khel-lV. This can be understood by studying inter-Khel variations resulting from unequal development, modernisation, openness, and practical rationality. Our enquiry in Khel-lV revealed that its gates have not been replaced for the last several decades, despite the fact that they not only look pristine but are badly damaged. These dilapidated doors are in stark comparison to the handsomely constructed Kidzü Kharu which was replaced in 1976. People of the lower Khels (III, II and I) still remember some ceremonies that go in gate-making, but those of the upper Khel have consciously forgotten them as they are incongruent with their new identity and set of rituals. Khel-I, in comparison to the others, has the largest survivors of the traditional religion, Nanyü'. The elaborate lore of rites observed at various genna, penna, and kenna7, and at Tiekrü-Mhuchü8 is still kept alive here. Here are more people observing the traditional Angami practices- especially utstikhru 9 and the hair style- than are in the other ytw.1^ though Christianity and a continuation of some of the traditional sty 'es of life have not been contradictory to them. In addition, ethnomedi- cal practices- particularly of inspirational and non-inspirational divination- of the Angamis survive in this Khel and its themumia (shaman) is consulted by the Nanyü of other villages, besides having clientage in his neighbourhood. These characteristics, crucial for constructing the traditional life of the Angamis, can be juxtaposed to the dominant scenario of Khel-I V, which is the most developed of all the Khels and continuing from the Campus of Science College, it reminds one of a small and peaceful town. People of this Khel are relatively more modernised and have open networks with the Kohima town. Besides being bigger and more populated, it comprises some men holding white-collar jobs in the town's bureaucracy. Political awareness is advanced and because of high literacy, a number of boys and girls from here speak English fluently. Some of its boys are studying in professional courses in Bangalore, Ranchi and other well known cities. School teachers are mostly from this Khel. The Baptist Church, having a magnificent building, has cent percent membership from here. This ethnographic backdrop optimally explains that all those conditions that</page><page sequence="12">72 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 assist the physical as well as the conceptual preservation of gate- as an embodiment of the Khel solidarity and the Angami identity- are relatively meagre in Khel- IV than they are in the lower Khels. A well- entrenched faith in Nanyü is indispensable for the construction, pulling and installation of a gate. In the last twenty years or so, only two gates have been replaced- a gate in Tsieyama Khel was replaced on 16th March, 1970 and the Kidzti Kharu was installed on 17th March, 197610, Besides a waning of Naoyü, the gates have lost their functional value with a changed arena of socio-political situations and an end to the inter-Khel and/or inter-village feuds. V The gates are sometimes named. In case the Khel has only a couple of gates, one placed above is usually palled Peso Kharu, while the other at the lower side is termed as Pekhro Kharu. But if there are more than two gates, each one has a distinct name derived from one or the other reason. Khel-I has three gates (see the Table on page 70.) Its most elegant gate, a fine example of workmanship, is Kidzu Kharu (KidzQ means 'front'). It is supposed to be the main entrance to the Khel. Facing a big playground, it connects the Khel to all other units of the village. Its second gate, leading to fields, is called Visenokure Kharu, after the name of a man who spent rice ( teihachti-u ) and money (raka) for its construction. It has not been replaced after 1924. Rudi Kharu, erected at the place from where the ancestors of Jotsoma entered, is the last gate •of Khel-1. Khel-IV also has three gates. The gate installed in the compound •of Nagi putsano is called Ketsano (meaning compound) or Khwünyüliezu (name of an ancestor) Kharu. One on the backside of the Village Council Hall is called Ngukhrienyü Kharu, after the name of one of the ancestors of Khel-IV. Rüsozou Kharu is near the Baptist Church and, as said befort, is the main gate to the Tholoflja thino (clan or Khel). Generally the gates are named according lo their spatial location, mythical value òf that site, or after the name of a resourceful person who supervised the work. VI A gate is nqt simply a massive plank of wood, prepared from the bole of a tree, but carries on it an ordered arrangement of .certain motifs, which are jnade on a gate before it is attached to the wooden fraipe. Epgraved on the gates, these motifs remain the same for all the Angami villages, although, individually speaking, some motifs may be attributed more importance and expression than the others. And it is interesting to note that there exists a basic pattern of these motifs in other Naga villages, in spite of qualitative cultural differences between them. A Kabui Naga told us that the motifs on his village gates^are similar to thosfe of.the Angamis'. Some Tankhuls from Ukhrul</page><page sequence="13">Marwah Sc Srivastava] Kheì Gate and Social Structure endorsed the similarity between the Angami and their gates. It may be stated here that gate symbolism remaining the same, differences between the Naga gates lie in configurational placement of their motifs. These differences are not only inter-Naga, but even within the Angamis they are conspicuous. A comparison of two photographs of the gates - from Kigwema and Jotsoma respectively- in Hutton's monograph (1969: facing page 78) substantiates this point, regardless of the fact that both these villages belong to the Khonoma group. Varying in size, most gates are elaborately and elegantly designed, while some appear to be poorly carved and half-heartedly finished. The huge gate of Barra Basti is a fine example of the former category. A comparative study of all the ten gates of the Jotsoma Khels yields the following motifs : 1. On top of a doór, there is a row of heads (puotsü) called rütsii. [In the Kigwema gate, referred to above, this row, instead of being on top, is carved on sides.] These heads are believed to be of the enemies ( ngumvümiatsü ). The Jotsoma gâtes have between four and six headl; only - one gate (of Khel-II) has four • heads, two (of Khel-II and Visenokure) have five each, and each of the rest has six. When asked abóut this variation, the people say that the number of heads does not have atiy significance. A few practical things need to be mention- ed here : Xi) the number of heads to be carved on the top is a function of available space ; (ii) it is conditioned by the size of each head; (If big heads are drawn, fewer can be accommodated.) (iii) it is affected by -the proximity between one head and the other (When space between two heads is less, more can be carved.) ; and (}v) it is conditioned by relative size of the heads. (For example, in' Ngukhrienyü Kharu, the size of heads decreases as one moves from the first to the sixth.) Rarely does the number exceed six, and it may be ~ mentioned that the number seven in the Angami society is believed to be unlucky (see, Hutton, 1969 : 251-2). One more observation may be noted: the new gates have more heads on the top row than their old counterparts. Rudi Kharu, for example, installed on 6th May, 1947, has six heads, while the one it replaced had three. A gate of Tsieyama Khel, bearing the post-Sekrengi date of 1970, is adorned with six compared to the old one which had four big heads. Each head has cotton balls in ears and mouth11 and possesses six or seven teeth.</page><page sequence="14">74 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 2. After the row of heads, there are two circular structures - opposed to each other- on two sides of the gate. One on the right symbolises the sun (Niaki), while the other is a depiction of the moon (Khrii). The moon has a more elaborate and richly coloured structure. Colours used to decorate the sun are less and its design is also relatively simple. Two closely drawn concentric circles enclosing a big star symbolise the sun in Kidzü Kharu. Ngukhrienyü Kharu's moon is painted in white, black and pink, whereas its sun has only white and black combination. In Pekhro Kharu of Khel-II, the inner most rim of the moon is slightly elevated. Coloured in yellow, black, pink and brown, it is contrasted to its companion, the sun, which is painted in yellow and black colours. Contrasting depictions of the moon and the sun on the doors support the traditional Angami belief that they are male and female, husband and wife, respectively (see, Hutton, 1969 : 410-1). 3. The bulk of a gate consists of a mithan head (Kewitsü), for which Archer (1946-8) used the term 'great spreading'. Broadly its designs remain the same, though its ears, represented in squarish projections, may either flare out exaggeratedly, or remain reasonably small. The mithan head may be depicted as having two concentric circles in the centre without properly formed eyes (e.g., Ngukhrienyü Kharu) or two properly carved and sometimes bulging eyes (e.g., Pekhro Kharu of Khel-III). Sometimes, nasal opening of the mithan may be shown (as in Visenokure Kharu). In Kidzü Kharu, eyes and ears are very well and proportionally carved out. Mithan horns are half white and half black. 4. Enclosed within the mithan horns is a Naga warrior ( riikhoumia ), depicted as a great head hunter. The way in which he is dressed enlightens some of the sociological characteristics of the Khel. In Jotsoma, a gate has only one warrior, but in Kigwema, the illustration in Hutton's book (1969 : facing page 78) shows three warriors- a tall one in the centre surrounded by two small ones- well enclosed in the sprawling horns. In some cases, the torso of a warrior is drawn within the mithan horns, while the warrior's head is outside (as in Kidzü Kharu). A warrior's size - drawn or carved - varies from one gate to the other, from one Khel to the other. The warrior may be tiny compared to big and elongated spreading of the mithan horns ; or he may be proportional to them. In some cases, the warrior is very big, thus eclipsing the impression created by the big mithan horns. The warrior drawn on a door of Khonoma (see, Fürer- Haimendorf, 1976) is quite tiny, but wears greatly flaring circular head-dress.

Besides the warrior, some Naga weapons, like spear, javelin head, dao, axe, etc., are also drawn within the mithan horns. Descriptions of some typical warriors highlight certain aspects of the Khel structure. Visenokure Kharu shows a naked warrior holding an enemy head in his right hand. It is adorned with a polished conch shell (yachu) worn in front. An ordinary Angami wears vachu-a part of which is 'cut away for the comfort of the wearer'- on nape of the neck. It is in context of renowned veterans that it is worn in front (Hutton, 1969 : 23; photograph facing page 36). Similarly, effigies erected on the graves of dead and the warrior on Khel gates have the conch shell in front covering chin with its tapering portion hanging down on sternum. The strips or beads that fasten it to neck are not clearly shown in the carving. In this gate, the warrior is devoid of a head gear (tsäre). The warrior carved on Pekhro Kharu of Khel-II is not naked. He wears a black kilt embroidered with cowries in three lines. In his ears, rosettes are attached (see Hutton, 1969 : 29), the outer rim of which is yellow in colour, and its inner one is painted black. He is wearing a head gear, in this case having five spikes from the tail of hornbill. The right to wear the wheel of hornbill feathers is given to those warriors who have taken a head, and 'those who have not done it are allowed to wear merely some substitute, or else imitation feathers made of paper' (Hutton, 1969 : 29). Apart from this, a warrior who has succeeded in head- hunting is also permitted to wear the fourth line of cowries. But this is not as important a diacritical sign as is adorning the head with hornbill feathers. Discounting this, the soldier shown on this gate is a veteran who has taken a head. Holding an enemy head in his left head, the warrior carries a dagger in his right. His legs are not elaborately carved, though he wears some cane rings (phiso) just below the knee. Since these rings are dyed black before being used, the same colour has been retained here for their depiction. Yellow and black colours are used for discriminating the details, the former being used in head gear and earring. The feet of warriors in all gates are carved and face the right side. Gripping a small javelin in his right hand and a head in left, the warrior in Pekhro Kharu of Khel-III has very clear feet, and, like all other cases, they face right. He wears a head gear; round his neck beads of some sort and necklets of plaited cane are placed; his upper arm is adorned with narrow rings called zunopa; a belt is tied below his waist but it does not cover the genitals; and the warrior's legs are surmounted by narrow rings, respectively called $okhe , phiso, and phipa. The cerejjiÇ*</page><page sequence="18">7$ Indian Anthropologist [17 , 1987 Dial dress of Rükhoumia is well carved in Rudi and Kidzü Kharus- in each he wears a head gear, two strips of cloth ( terha ) are crossed at chest, polished conch shell hangs in front, the arms- besides zunopa-ntQ decorated with an ivory armlet ( chütho ) which is painted yellow, the wrist rings (bipa)- painted red- are also shown, and the legs are decorated with sokhe, phiso, and phipa. A clear colour combination is seen in Kidzü Kharú as it is only a decade old. In most cases, a warrior holds one head- hunted by him- in either right or left hand, but the one of Ngukhrienyü Kharu is shown carrying two heads, thus symbolising a warrior of higher grade. He, except in Visenokure, is carved ceremonially dressed, but, in most cases, his penis (tito) - in semi-erect position - is exposed, symbolising virility. An account on Nagaland (Census of India, 1971; Nagaland series 15; Part II-A, General Population Tables) states that the white thing hanging on the shield (pezhu or mezhu ) signifies that the women of an enemy Khel have been seduced by the warrior. Likfe other diacritical signs, shield is used (or is associated with) by those who have hunted heads. 5. As said earlier, the warrior, drawn inside the horns, is coupled with some Naga weapons. Spear and javelin heads are frequently drawn, though their shape, size, and the number of barbs on them, vary. A gate as a reflection of changing social reality may give place to modern weapons. For example, the warrior of Pekhro Kharu of Khel-III has a rifle lying below his right hand which carries a small spèàr. Elephant tusks are not drawn on all the gates. Mostly on the gates of Khel-I, they are placed outside the mithan horns, one on each side in yellow/ white and black colour combination. The Khonöma gate (Fürer- Haimendorf, 1976) has the tusks drawn closely in a separate pattern near the tapering side of mithan horns. With these weapon's, in some gates the ears of paddy ( telhakre ) may also be drawn (see, for example Kidzü Kharu). 6. Below the sprawling mithan horns, a couple of mithans are carved. The right and the left sides of the gate may have one mithan each, or two may be drawn on either side, leaving one for the other side. The mithan spreading of Ketsano Kharu is very big, containing a mithan along with both the warrior and weapons. One of the mithans may be seen with a plougher (for example, Visenokure and Kidzü Kharu). There may be one or two mithans drawn or carved at the bottom of a gate after a few other motifs. An attempt is always made to draw on a gate as many mithans as possible. It may sometimes have four or five mithan representations, besides the 'exaggerated horns' of this animal (Hutton, 1969 : 66). 7. The base of a mithan head, closely allied with a couple of mithans and sometimes a plougher, is followed by two ubiquitous patterns.</page><page sequence="19">Mařwah &amp; Srivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 77 One is a long strip, broad at two ends that taper inwardly - to these ends, having orifices, are tied the ropes for dragging purpose (see, the next section). Bearing simple patterns, usually vertical lines, this pattern is known as meyhak.hu ; symbolising the case in which dao is kept. The last pattern consists of a row of long protruding symbols. Their number varies but on an average there are ten such carvings on each gate, However, the Visenokure has twelve such patterns in a row, the Kidzü consists of ten, and in Ketsano, there are two rows of these protrusions, having six and fifteen patterns respectively. Such carvings are not only confined to the Khel doors, they may be seen on 'front gates of houses, and even on the wooden bridges that span the streams' (Hutton, 19 69 : 67). Although some people in Jotsoma summarily dismissed them as an aspect of decoration, others opined that either they were the breasts of women or the udders of cows. Of course, the form of a breast and that of an udder is not wholly dissimilar. After this carving, in case the space permits, a few more mithans may be drawn. These drawings are made not only when the gate is being constructed de novo, but may be added to the already existing gate on an auspicious day. Some motifs are carved out of wood, like the top row of heads, the moon and the sun, mithan head, meyhakhu, and the row of protruding symbols. The warrior may be either engraved or simply drawn, and the weapons, ears of paddy, a couple of other mithans, the peasant, are generally drawn on the gates, and the size of each motif depends on the availability of space. Colours used to decorate carvings and drawings are pink, light blue, black, red, white and yellow. With a passage of time, more colours have been used. The 1976 gate of Khel-I is a good example of a well-painted and ornamented structure; and there is another interesting thing about it. To make it last long, on its original wooden structure a thick layer of cement has been laid, and, owing to this, it is often called Cemented Kharu. Perhaps the people of Khel-I knew that it was the last time they would have a replacement of their gate ! Amidst a new identity and consciousness, gate-pulling has now become an incongruent practice. vn In this section, we discuss the processes of gate-construction and pulling, as they are relevant in the context of Nanyü. The need to replace a gate arises when it is rendered non-functional because of being eaten by termites, or becomes too dilapidated to bear the demands of ensuring security. Or several recurrent cataclysmic happenings in a Khel - death, for example - require an overhauling or replacement of the existing set of material appurtenances like, gates, barricades, fences, pãnjis (spikes of hardened bamboo stuck in earth to impede the passage of an çnerny), etc., that give it an identity. If the gate is believed to be</page><page sequence="20">78 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 auspicious and exists in a not-too- worn- out condition, it may be retained for decades. Suppose it is lost in an army operation, the need to replace it after amity prevails is an important priority. In case there are several mishaps after the installation of a new gate, the people decide to replace it in a couple of years . The desire to have a new gate is suggested by some members in a secret meeting of the Khel elders, occuping differential (in terms of age), political and legel (Gaonbura or Rünakrü), or magico-religious (Kemovo, Zhevo, Tsakro, Lidepfü) positions. The decision, taken collectively, and esoterically, is gradually communicated to other members of the Khel, but since the Angamis are patrilineal, patrilocal, and patriarchal, the matters of crucial socio-political and spiritual importance remain confined to males. Erection of a new gate generally takes place after the festival of Sekrengi which falls on the second day after the full moon of the month Kezei (February) or of the month of Kera (March). It takes about one to three months for the final installation of a gate from the time decision is taken. Selection of a heavy-trunked tree, from which the gate is to be carved out, inaugurates the long-drawn out processes of construction, pulling and installation of gates. A quasi-group of the Khel members consisting of the righteous people ( miathomia ) who have performed the 'four great social gennas' (Hutton, 1969 : 230), other elders (Phichümia, Rünakrü and Krüta), and two boys- in the range of ten to twelve years, who have never had sexual intercourse (celibate; phousemia)- is entrusted with the task of selecting a tree. In technical as well as ritual aspects pertaining to the replacement of gates, the two phouses, who may be from any putsano of the Khel, occupy a very significant place. Out of a number of boys who may come up to the specifications of age and celibacy, those having the best, impressive and also the most auspicious names are selected for the rituals. To an outsider, all the Angami names are equally impressive, as each one is an improvisation of an idea suggesting the presence of good fortune and qualities (also see, Hutton, 1969 : 218-9). But the contextual worth of each name is different, and hence from an impressive list of names, those deemed to best serve the imperatives of gate construction and pulling rituals are selected. An Angami of Khwüma Khel informed us that for the gate rituals, names which denote courage and strength are preferred over those bidding good health or long life. For example, a name like Kouto ('We'll win') is a preferred choice. Krukielie Nagi of Tholoma Khel, who was one of the twenty five participants in the tableau depicting gate-pulling ceremony in the Republic Day Parade of 1978, said that the Angami names like Keviketo, Rokuosielie, Seyiekhrielie, etc., which depict the ideas of valour and chivalry, could be regarded as some impressivo and preferred ones.</page><page sequence="21">Marwah &amp; Srivastava ] Khel Gate and Social Structure A boy, born on a day when his parents gave an important feast, also has good chances of being selected. Rarovilhou Kelhou of Khel-II was named so because he was born the day his father was offering the chiisha feast. For gaining full details of the principles underlying naming and selection of boys for the gate-pulling rituals, it would have been excellent had we interviewed the men, who as phousemia were selected in one or the other gate construction ceremony. But it could not be accomplished because of 'short memory' of the people. The last gate-pulling caremony took place in Thekrünoma Khel on 17th March, 1976, and our valiant effort to meet those phousemia who participated in it was in vain as 'no one in that Khel or in other parts of the village seemed to know anything about it'. Moreover, once people endeavour to merge themselves in a new identity, they unhesitatingly make conscious efforts to forget their past, or what may be contemporarily considered by them 'inferior' or 'inglorious' identity ; and Christianity has already succeeded in providing the people of Nagaland a great tradition that has concatenated them to the international community of the Christians. In this great transformation, traditional practices of the Nanyü believers have gradually been eliminated. A gate, measuring on an average eight to nine feet in length, three to three and a half feet in breadth and three to four inches in thickness is made from the plank of just one bole. The task of selecting a tree of such a girth ( meguo ) is entrusted to a group generally consisting of ten people. They go to the forest to select the best mego - a kind of tree - from which the new gate would be carved out. Once selected, the site and location of the tree is not disclosed to others. A tree with broken branches does not warrant selection; only when full - that is to say, its branches have not been cut - it may be considered. Hutton (1969 : 457) writes that in Kigwema, the tree chosen for making a gate had a girth which was three times the breadth of the doorway. Archer (February, 1947) writes : 'it was taboo to put up a gate smaller than the old one- the new gate must be either the same size or, preferably, bigger'. Krukielie Nagi of Tholoma remembered that for constructing the Ketsano Kharu, the massive gate of the Nagi Compound, the wood was brought from Liehotsa jungle. Located on the Western side of Jotsoma, this jungle was principally selected because it had the best trees. Other physical characteristics of the tree like, absence of knots, good quality of wood, girth, etc., are equally inspected before testing it for spiritual parameters. In other words, the physical fitness of a tree does not qualify its selection as Kharu wood, unless supernatural sanction conveyed through the medium of dreams {mho) also makes it lucky and fortunate {meguo).</page><page sequence="22">80 indián Anthropologist [17, 1987 The young celibate boys who accompany the tree selection team are required to dream that night, and if the dreams are unfavourable, the tree on probation is rejected and the qua si-group starts anew to select another tree with the physical prerequisites. Realizing supernatural sanctions and eliciting good or bad omens from dreams are also associa- ted with a large number of other activities in the Angami Society (see Hutton, 1969 : 52, 246-7) ; all of them are cut across by the same dream symbolism. Seeing some one seriously ill, or dying, or a mourning ceremony, or a scene of accidents, are the examples of bad (suo) dreams. On the contrary, dreaming harvesting scenes, mother and child, or a cow and its calf, is good (vi). The boys - in the sacred state - narrate their dreams the next morning and appropriate steps are taken. But what is the certainty that the celibates would dream ? And also what is the certainty that they would remember their dreams ? These questions of relevance in other cultures are impertinent in the Angami set of beliefs because it is believed by the people that the phenomenon of dream is independent of individual will A dream results as a consequence of 'supernatural causation' and the boys accompanying the tree-selection team will dream that night and also will remember all the ensuing details. Supernatural will is conveyed through the medium of dreams. Before felling the tree, the celibates touch it with some common leaves in presence of the ritual specialists of the Khel, and then, to start with, three strong and powerful men nick it slightly with axes. Later on, the volunteers join and axe it down. Sometimes, after felling the tree, a white fowl is released. If it 'leaps over the trunk and crows, the tree is believed to be particularly powerful' (Archer, 1946-8). There are neither separate specialists nor tools. Absence of role-specialization is matched by an equal absence of special instruments. Roles are combina- tive12 and so are the implements. The carvings (or 'decorations' as a young Angami said) on the plank are made by males only. Those who know carving and can replicate the patterns of the old gates, volunteer their services. Although there may be around twenty people present at the site of carving, generally six or seven persons begin work on the plank together. First of all, the trunk is shaped into a plank ; and this is done in the forest, right at the place where the tree was felled. Some motifs, viz. 'great spreading' mithan horns and the warrior, are roughly carved (see Archer, 1947) on the plank before bringing it out to a level place where water is easily accessible and a temporary habitation can be erected It is to be noted here that the plank selected for a gate should not have any cracks. In çase it has, the Angamis believe that there would be some sort of a</page><page sequence="23">Marwah &amp; Srivastava ] Khel Gate and Social Structure 81 catastrophe. Archer (1946-8) reports that the Tsotonoma Khel of Kohima village (now called Barra Basti) inadvertently carved the gr.te on a plank that contained minor cracks. A couple of years later, many of its young men died. A large number of its people claimed that they were warned in their dreams about the faulty gate. They decided to replace it and the ceremony (witnessed by Archer) took place in 1947 after the war. In terms of configuration, the new gate is a replica of the one it replaces. The motifs drawn on it have timelessly remained the same. Each gate is an apotheosisation of the Khel structure, and apophthegma- tically expresses the achievements of Khel people in spiritual and chivalrous terms. Along with a generality in the patterns of a gate, it is also a reflection of the social reality prevalent in the Khel at the time of its construction. Although this point will be developed later, it may hastily be added that changes occurring in the social unit from the installation of the old gate to the time it is replaced, which may not be, in normal course, less than twenty to thirty years, are incorporated in the nuances of major configurations. The assiduously imitating carvers introduce only finer or minute changes in the motifs to record the up-to- date social reality. And these minute changes are not many. Therefore, enjoying carte blanche , the carvers carry out the work on their own. It means that there is no need of a leader to organize the work force. In this connection, it is relevant to quote Archer (25th February, 1947) who observed the carving of a new village gate at Kohima. First four and a little later six men all began work on the plank together- while the others stood or sat around- there was no leader and it was as if everyone had the same idea of how the gate should be cut. Sometimes a point was discussed or someone intervened or pointed with a finger- otherwise the work went auto- matically on. In the first stage the rough forms were levelled down with a tool like an adze - the surface being hacked away in long parallel lines. It is this which gives the mithan horns one of their most beautiful effects. As the pick-axe clears the wood it leaves a line on either side- and these lines form a mass of branching curves. Some of the shaping is done by slicing with a dao- while for giving an edge an axe is used- for finer lines the wood is chipped away by hammering on a chisel or a finely tapered wedge. Although the blows are given with great swiftness, there is at the same time a remarkable deftness and precision in all the cutting. Everyone was in complete command of his tools. Occasionally a line was marked in pencil to guide the cutting. In every sense a collective act. Altogether 15-20 men at various times did cutting- the basic pattern was cut in the finest- without a model - obviously a keen visual memory - a clear common conception of the fine carving - only members of the Khel did the cutting - a Khel act. Though no rituals are performed when carving is commenced, the artists are not permitted to have any carnal relations ( na ). Women are not allowed to visit the site where cutting and carving goes on. In the liminal stage of transforming the wood to Kharu, the artists are ought to</page><page sequence="24">82 Indian Anthropologist [17, 103? be in a state of ritual purity. It takes about a week to ten days for completing the carvings, colouring and preparing the Kharu for pulling purposes. Some motifs are carved with a hand-drill ( chiigeh ) and a chisel ( kethi ), others are simply drawn with a knife (tsukwe). When these processes are on, an auspicious day for dragging ceremony is found out. Till the period of construction is on, the men working on the plank - in the rites of transition - do not visit their village. Although they keep minimum ration (rice, pigs, fowls, etc.) with them, at leisure they may go for hunting. Evening time is generally spent on collecting fire-wood. Cooked food is not sent from the village, thus keeping the conceptual distinction between the 'settled community' and the transitional period in which the carvers exist. It is clear from Archer's description that compared to axe ( seidurü ) and chisel, dao- a hand-bill generally used for wood cutting and as a weapon- is used less for levelling and carving. After the gate has been carved out, it should not be touched with dao. In case it is done, a case is registered with the Village Council (Kehouthechü) against the offender; and in those days when the Council had not emerged - with the Khels at feud with each other- such a case was stringently dealt with by the Khel body. A dao is an implement of day-to-day activity. Concerned with mundane or everyday existence, its relation with the Naga is an intimate one. Even today when much of the Naga material culture has changed with the import of modernisation, one can see old as well as young Naga males carrying dao in a wooden sling hanging at the back of the waist. Striking Kharu (and not the wood from which it is carved out), which once accomplished is an object of veneration, with dao would amount to contaminating the enclave of sacred-cum-rare spiritual object. And also, by extrapolating Durkheimian thesis (1912), one can say that accomplish- ment of Kharu is the first step in the crystallization and convergence of Khel sentiments, and any peril to it in the form of an attack by a weapon of profanity- dao- is a threat to be strongly combated. It was stated earlier that the task of carving a gate from the plank is only of the Khel people and no one either from other Khels of the village or the Khels in alliance of other villages would be requested for carving purposes. A taboo (penna) is also imposed on them, thus forbidding them to visit the construction site. Though no explicit information is sent to them at this time, they may come to know about the preparation underway for gate-dragging ceremony through highly integrated and face-to-face social relations When the carvings are on, as said earlier, a day is fixed for pulling ceremony, i.e. dragging the gate from the site of its construction, which is outside the village in the close vicinity of the forest, to the place where it will be installed. The neighbours in other Khels, relatives and friends of the Khels in allianc?</page><page sequence="25">[Marwah &amp; Srivastavä] Khel Gate and Social Structure 83 are formally informed about this day and they make all preparations to come to the ceremony. Absence of a relative or a Khel in alliance has grave repercussions. Gate-pulling ceremony is an occasion to foster and ratify pacts and relationships between them and absence from it amounts to their severance. A week before the dragging ceremony, the Khel members keep the rope ready, which would be required for pulling the gate. As is construction, so is gate-pulling a male prerogative. Before the commencement of gate-pulling ceremony, the newly constructed gate is dragged up before hand to within one or one and a half kilometers or so of the village. Dons a couple of days before the ceremony, no genua attends to it and it is brought close to the village without any ceremonial dress. It is covered with grass, bushes, thorns and sometimes with barbed wire, and at night, it is guarded by two men. It is a taboo to mount the gate or the ropes that lie there for the dragging ceremony. On the appointed day of the ceremony, the Kemovo and one Phichümia leave the Khel early in the morning to perform the terhase genna. Carrying with them some fragment of fresh rice beer (zumho), a small chicken ( thevünuo ), and few plantain leaves, they reach the place where the gate is kept. Hutton, however, in the details of gate-pulling he got from Sachema - another village in the Khonoma group of the Angami Nagas - found that the Kemovo 'goes early in the morning to the stump of the tree from which the door was cut' (1969 : 212). In the description we got from a number of respondents in Jotsoma, there is no mention of the stump and the elders go to the site where the gate lies, being guarded by some young men. From the plantain leaves, two cups are made. The chicken is let loose and fed, while liquor is poured in the cups. Once full, they are offered to the chicken and if it takes the zumho, the omen is regarded good. Immediately after performing the ritual, both of them- the Kemovo and the other elder - return to the Khel and while walking briskly away from the gate, they do not look behind. It is believed in Jotsoma that if they turn towards the gate there is a likelihood that the spirit, pacified through the terhase genna , may attack them. In the Sachema description (Hutton, 1969 : 212), the Kemovo does not return to the village, but carries out further rituals with Zhevo and Tsakro. After the performers of terhase genna have left, the string ropes, which would be held for dragging, are tied to the two holes especially drilled on lower part of the gate ( meyhakhu ) - that means there would be two rows of people dragging it. Hutton's Sachema description reads like this (1969 : 212) : TheKeimvo ties two thin strings to the door and drags at and breaks them. Then two boys, who have never had sexual intercourse, one Kepezoma and one Kepepfiima and both naked, the former on the right and the other on the left, tie on two string ropes, which must on no acçoijnt subsequ ently break, and pull them.</page><page sequence="26">84 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 The two boys stand holding the strong ropes, when two zhevos of the Khel bless ( theja ) the gate by touching it with grass ( kurhi ) in the following words : Kharu teshü ketuo ki theja die ko No sei kevi puo-e, nbu nu vodi themia kelhou chatuo Thenu-theno se chütuo Tie mu zu chatuo Kicii-Kirei chatuo, n nou pese di nchü nba nu volie, Themia bu rei mu no rei kekrü-kediwa suo 'The blessing words of the gate-pulling ceremony Oh Wood ! You are worthy ( or, you are a fine wood); After reaching, you will have to pray for the life of men (so that their number increases) (or, you have to go and ask- demand, beg, etc. - for the life of people). You will have to pray for longevity and prosperity of women and children; With you in charge, there will be prosperity in paddy and cultivât on; You will have to pray for the pientifulness of domestic animals; Oh Wood ! You should properly (cautiously) reach your destined place; In your journey (from here to the appointed place) you as well as the people carrying you should not come across any problem*.18 Once these words are delivered, dragging commences with the ventral or the carved facade of the gate facing upwards. Men adorned in ceremonial dress hold the string ropes, and proceed to pull it towards the Khel gateway awaiting its installation. People not having a role in the pulling activity get inside the Khel. It is a taboo to follow or get behind the gate- and Hutton writes : The clan to whom the door belongs drags the right rope and the other clan or clans drag the left rope. Every male in the village (including small boys) has to have his hand on the rope, though the dragging is really done by a dragging party. A person not of the Khel or a Khel in alliance is prohibited to either touch the ropes or cross the two lines of the draggers. In the past, if one did so, he was 'pierced with the blunt end of a spear' and Archer wrote that 'even toddy (1947), he would be immediately set upon and beaten'. People in Jotsoma recapitulate that only those having no knowledge of dragging taboos would dare to touch the ropes or cross the lines. The outsiders are implored to remain outside. While dragging the gate, the participants sing several songs like, Hutho, Kikrünuo, Rüyufhe, Hute, Minuofhie, Sishüfhe, Sefhe, etc., in which the emphasis is not that much on the lines as it is on encouraging and merry-making sounds like, ho, hi, aio, whe, we, o, etc.14 The same line of a song may be repeated several times - for example, in Hutho, the line Whe yhorei we o puokrü is sung severally with different modulations. Again, it may be noted that these songs are sung on other occasions as well like, Naga Puja (Sekrengi), Chiepu erection ceremony, houçe Çfçi) ççnstruction, Tekrengi, etc.</page><page sequence="27">Marwah &amp; Srivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 85 With a mass acceptance of Christianity, it was said earlier, the conventions characterizing the traditional society have fallen in oblivion» therefore, for an observational account of the gate-pulling ceremony, one has to depend on old anthropological descriptions. The Gazetter of Nagaland, District Kohima (1979) has a picture of a gate being pulled in the streets of Kohima and one sees the Angami Nagas bedecked in traditional dress, but there is no accompanying account. Similarly one of the picture post-cards released by the Department of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting, Kohima and the tourist guide, under the title of Kohima Welcomes You, carry the pictures of Angami gate-pulliog. Hutton describes the dragging of a new door in the compass of few words under the rubric of Angami Gennas, but it is not an observational account. The most lucid and vivid description of this ceremony is in Archer's manuscripts (23th February, 1947) and since, in our opinion, it is the rarest account available in anthropological notes, it deserves a long quote : The actual conduct of the gate from its place in the forest to its site in the wall is a gay triumphal march, and it will illustrate the ritual if I briefly describe what took place when the Tsotonoma Khel of Kohima dragged in its new gate to the village on 23rd February 1947. The gate which had been roughly shaped Jay by the roadside under a heap of thorns and bushes, a mile outside the village. The road glistened in the afternoon sun and from the hill- top, Kohima and all its village paths stood boldly out above the town. About 3 p.m. some blank bombs exploded and as I stood in the road below the gate I saw a long line of tiny figures no larger than ants, hurrying down the paths. For a while the tin shacks in the bazaar engulfed them. Then they reappeared, streaming up the road in a long winding line. As I looked they were still only an inch high, and the long procession itself only a line of broken colour- a gay yellow blending into pink and white. As the line came slowly nearer, shrill cries and rhythmic chanting and singing came up on the wind like the rich chords of a regimental band. Then the line came fully into view. The two 'first strikers' were walking at the head- one of them bearing a huge shield decorated with peacocks and chickens' feathers. After them came thirty warriors decorated in dangling braces of yellow fruits. Then came a long line of minor warriors with scarlet and white sashes on their chests, black kilts with lines of white cowries at their thighs, and huge balls of white cotton in their ears. After them strode young men in similar uniforms but with strands of cotton piled on their hair and huge circular headdresses fanning out above their heads. In the rear came swarms of children each resplendant in dazzling scarlet sashes. The whole procession must have covered over half a mile. When the head reached the gate site, the long line came slowly to a halt and the first striker approached the gate. He picked a little grass, then, standing at the foot, he sprinkled the blades on the ground and spoke to the huge piece of wood. He then pulled back a branch of thorns, others joined him, all the thorns and bushes were pulled away and the gate came fully into view. The surface was now carefully brushed with plants, the thick fibres of a forest creeper were attached to poles and the two sides were then linked to fibre ropes which stretched far down the hill. When all was ready, the leaders said 'We have besought Ukepenuophu18 for every good thing- abundant crops, many children, many cattle. She will grant</page><page sequence="28">86 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 them to us. Let us go'. Then the band was formed into two lines, each holding the long ropes, the strain was taken and the gate slid smoothly down the road like a vessel gliding on the slips. As the lines went slowly down, the tufted headdresses swayed and tossed like feathered blossom on a row of trees. When the lines reached the bazaar, the leader rushed and plunged ahead brandishing his shield shaking his spear and cutting aerial capers over the ground. Younger warriors broke out behind him springing and leaping in the air, while shouts arose of 'No one can defeat us. We are the boldest warriors', Then, finally the lines went up the hill, women from the Khel stood round in bands gazing at the slow triumphal march. As the procession reached the wall, the fibres were stacked to one side and thé warriors passed through the gateway and on to the village. When almost all were in, the gate itself came into view, a group of forty warriors heaved and strained at the ropes and gradually the huge frame mounted the slopes. About fifty yards below the wall, the party left the path and the gate was brought to rest on a patch of ground screened by tall bamboos. Here it was cerefully covered with branches and left for the night. Later in the evening the whole Khel shared a great feast. In its communal display, its dazzling brilliance of colour, its devoted service, the ceremony was a complete expression of religious homage. Obviously, since the time taken for dragging the gate depends on the distance it has to cover, the dragging party adjusts its time accordingly. Generally the ceremony begins around noon so that the draggers reach the village well before evening. Once the gate is brought close to its gateway, the draggers from the Khel drop their rope first and proceed inside, followed by those from the Khels in alliance. Proceeding in a procession to the look-out ( tehuba ) and other places, they may relax after an arduous and tiring work. Then the ritual specialists- the Kemovo, the Zhevo, and in some cases, the Tsakro- take a chicken and touch the door with its beak and while doing so, they repeat the theja words. After this, the chicken is taken to the first house next to the gate, where it is slaughtered by the Kemovo, who later eats it that night. Arrival of the gate is an occasion of great celebrations and to mark it, rice beer is lavishly offered to all, and Hutton (1969 : 213) writes that a compound called hinu, prepared from maize, Job's tears, rice, beans, chillies, salt, and kenya, is eaten until the evening meal is served. Lying close to the gateway, the door- in a sacred state being super- vised by the genna - is covered with dry grass and thorns with some young sentinels guarding it throughout the night. They watch that no vermin or other animal jumps on the gate and the same prohibition also applies to human beings. The next day is also spent on feasting the relatives and friends. Fresh zu (also called pita modhu) is prepared in the house next to the gateway, and generously served to all. Evenings of these merry- making days are made resplendent with dances. Young men, turn-by-turn discharging the duty of sentinels, watch that the door is not sullied by anyone. Feasting and social intercourse with the Khels in alliance continue till the afternoon of the third day, when the Kbel jnembçrs are</page><page sequence="29">Mařwah &amp; Srìvastava ] Khel Gate and Social Structure 87 supposed to erect the gargantuan door and fix it on the wooden frams. Now it is time for convergence of intra-Khel relations that in the last couple of days almost disappeared in the social consciousness resulting out of interactions with relatives, friends, and the Khels in alliance. The gate, which hitherto has been lying, is now made to stand with its carved portion facing outwardly. Immediately after this, the Khel people request the visitors to bid adieu and leave the place. When the gate is going to be tied to the frame, there should not be any outsider in the Khel. Once the exit of all guests is ascertained, the youngmen fasten the door to its frame with strong creepers and when this is done, no member of the Khel is permitted to remain out. For the third time, the newly fastened gate receives blessings from the Kemovo, the Zhevo, and the Tsakro, and after this ceremony, which is generally performed in the evening, the gate is closed for the night. Next morning, it is opened by the person who lives next to it and the Khel returns to the normal ritual status' with its routinized life restored. The Khel was in a ritual status (penna ) between the days of its dragging and actual installation. In the latter period, no one is permitted to go to fields and engage in cultivation. The gate is looked after by the family living next to it, and its head is usually referred to as the Chowkidar. It may be added here that the 'modhu' for the gate-pulling ceremony is collectively prepared and the sacrifice of a theviinuo is performed in this house. In those times when head-hunting was prevalent, besides the Chowkidar, the 'great warrior' (terhämiavi) of the Khel used to live in close vicinity of the gate. Realizing the imminent danger of an attack on the Khel or an invasion, he always remained alert. In times when the gates were functional, they were opened early in the morning and shut before night descended when all the Khel people had come back. During the day time, vigilance was exercised either by the Chowkidar or any male member of the Khel who happened to be home that day. The old gate, which is to be replaced, is unfastened from its frame and removed by issueless men of the Khel. No genna is attended to this task and also no rituals are observed. The old gate is neither destroyed nor disposed off, but is kept behind the wooden frame. Widely believed that nefarious spirits, like terhoma, dwell on the old gate, one is prohibited to touch it. The Angamis say that an act of touching it annoys the spirit, which, once maligned, causes illness to the offender. This prohibition is strongly adhered to, despite the fact that they have all embraced Christianity, old and when in the course of field-work V.K.S. inadvertently touched the old sate lying in Khel-III, a local man reprimanded him and advised him not to repeat this act for the fear of villianous spirits. Under the veneer of</page><page sequence="30">88 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1PS7 new identity and transformation, some of these traditional values are still persisting. In Khel-II, one of the old gates was lost in army operation, but in most cases, they are seen lying behind their successors. Languish- ing with every season, they are important anthropological pieces and since the practices connected with traditional culture have declined, it would be better if they are retrieved for museums. VIII It was said earlier that from the perspective of ownership of land - both of Khetipani (irrigated) and Jhum - »identity, and ancestral history, a Khel was an independent unit, and at one time, relations between different Khels were interrupted with unending feuds. Balancing antagonistic ties at that time, there was a ritual functionary, deriving his descent from the formal founder of the village, whose duty was to perform rites for the welfare and prosperity of all, and therefore, such a status endeavoured to unite the rivalling clans in one (Fürer- Haimendorf, 1976 : 13). But over time with an annexation of various Khels into one, opening of countryside, and assimilation of diverse units into one against all types of outsiders and encroachers, inter-Khel rivalry has gradually been replaced by amity, mutual understanding and cooperation. An integra- tion of Khels in a village is more pronounced now than it was earlier. In spite of this, Khel unity has a priority over all other things, and a Khel is defacto a functional unit. And such a thing has continued since the Angamis were ruled neither by chiefs nor had an individual exercising authority over the entire village community, and thus, relations between Khels were organized on democratic lines. Each Khel has its own gates which spatially as well as symbolically mark its unity, and therefore, the task of gate-construction is under- taken by the Khel members. For dragging it to the Khel from the site of its construction, besides the Khel people, all those who belong to other Khels of the village and the Khels in alliance are invited. Mirth- making and jocund celebration go on for a couple of days in which identity of the Khel disappears in a larger identity of the Angami Nagas. At the time of its installation on to the wooden frame, no out- sider-that is to say, not living in that Khel- is supposed to remain inside that Khel. The Khel identity which disappeared in the 'vast ocean of consience collective ' returns to its earlier state. Gate-pulling is a solemn occasion for rejuvenating and cementing relations of the Khel with others of the village and the Khels of other villages with which it has enduring alliance. An old man of Khel-II, Pfüyienyü Nisa, recalled that the Kharu, which was replaced in 1946, was pulled by all male members of Jotsoma.' Representatives and envoys came from the Khels of other villages like, Khonoma, Mezoma, Setsoma, Keruphema, etc. Being a ceremonial occasion, every male was adorned in the traditional and festal Angami dress and ornaments. Women also wore their best dresses and jewellry.</page><page sequence="31">Marwah Sc Srivastava ] Khel Gate and Šocial Structure §§ Nostalgically he remembered that the 'feast of pulling the gate' (sisûnye) was organized for all the participants and guests. Gate-pulling is an occasion to ratify inter-personal relations. Archer (1946-8) writes : 'The gate in fact is regarded not merely as the clue to Khel welfare, but indirectly as the welfare agent for all those with whom the Khel is allied'. And on these occasions, alliances are re- declared. Archer noted that when the Kohima gate was being installed, each Khel coming from other villages declared its alliance addressing the inviter in the following words : 'We belong to different Khels but we are sons of one father. We will always stick together. You are our guardian. Of old you saved us from our enemies. May you long continue to protect us. May our friendship last forever'. Obviously, non-attendance on these occasions is not only resented, but relations between them are severed. IX In a simple and undifferentiated society, like that of the Angami Nagas as they were a few decades ago, there is no mechanism to measure the quantum of labour and resources spent on a ritual activity, produc- tion of an object, undertaking a war expedition, construction of a dormitory ( kichuki ), etc. Labour required for individual purposes- like, building of house, pulverisation of soil, or harvest - is sought on reciprocal basis from kinsmen and the seeker is expected to feed all those who come to share his work. In case an entity to be used communally is to be constructed, every one is obliged to render service, and if some activities are a part of cash economy, each house of the Khel is expected to contribute equally towards raising the cash. It is difficult to work out the substantive aspects of gate economy, as neither are there any expository accounts nor gate installation is likely to occur in future. But some of its characteristics may be attempted on the basis of accretive marks inscribed on gates, replaced not very long ago. Out of the ten Jotsoma gates, six bear year and/or date when they were installed. The upper gate of Tsieyama Khel, erected on 16th March, 1970, shows the following inscription. Pevokewa (Expense Raka 18420 Rupees 18420 Telhachü-u Big baskets of paddy) CoBtextually, it means that the total expenditure incurred on instal- ling this gate came to certain thousand rupees and several baskets of rice. The number of baskets spent on feast is, however, not given. Both the gates of Khel-II have been replaced in the last forty years or so, but the amount of money or tshii (food grain) spent on it is not given on the one which was installed in 1946, but the other bearing the post-Sekrengi date of 6th May, 1954 shows that Rs. 800 was spent on it. Visenokure</page><page sequence="32">ôô tndìan Anthropologist [17, 1087 Kharu, replaced in 1924, does not carry the amount incurred on it. Rudi Kharu, installed on 6th May 1947, had an expenditure of Rs. 600, while the Cemented Kharu bearing the date of 17th March, 1976 shows Rs. 1 1 ,037. Gates replaced in late forties and early fifties show an expenditure of less than one thousand rupees. In another twenty-five to thirty years, it crosses more than ten thousand rupees ; and this fact shows a growing affluence of people. It is intriguing to understand that the expenditure in 1970 was about seven thousand more than what it was in 1976. Money for the feast comes from the Khel members as well as the relatives and guests from other Khels and villages. Each visiting Khel is supposed to bring some cash contribution, directly proportional to its economic prosperity. While handing over the present, each Khel representive prays for a long lasting friendship of the Khels. Archer (1947) wrote that in Tsotonama Khel gate-pulling ceremony, the visitors brought cash contributions ranging from Rs. 30 to 500. The entire collection is spent on the formal feast, and before inviting them to partake it, the Khel inmates thank their guests for generous donations. Alliance between Khels in independent of their cash contributions. X Sacredness is superimposed on objects. And the process of its superimposition is gradual and sanctified through performance of an array of rituals. Once the dream is favourable and the bole is without any inside growth of bark, the wood- without any halo of sacredness and a part of nature - is transferred to the category of Khara wood, which has entered the domain of sacredness by becoming a part of culture. Kharu wood is vulnerable to pollution, and thus needs to be saved from all defiling agents, women in particular. With a transformation of Kharu wood into Kharu, the aura of sacredness further enlarges, and with this, its vulnerability to pollution. It is guarded at night, though covered with creepers, bushes, thorns and grass. Till the time, the wood is cut into Kharu, the genna is only attended to by the artists and other helpers, but once preparation for its pulling is made, the entire Khel observes prohibitions, and no one, on any account, is permitted to go for cultiva- tion or any other work. _ Spiritualism is opposed to materialism. Sacredness is opposed to economy. And material advantages are shunned. A huge tree is selectèd for making the gate, but the remaining wood is allowed to waste. Hutton (1969 : 457) says that a number of paddy-pounding tables may be máde from the remaining wood, but for their use the women would have to mount on them and this would amount to climbing the Kharu, which of course is tabooed. Thus the gate is perpetually in a sacred state, even when it regulates routine.</page><page sequence="33">Marwah &amp; Srivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 91 Sacredness of the gate suffuses all aspects; if the gate is good and grants welfare, people would have excellent dreams. And visits to other Khels would be arranged. If goodness does not prevail and even after its replacement, people are deprived of auspicious signs and omens, a kind of genua is imposed on the Khel. 7 hey would not ceremonially visit other Khels and would think in terms of having a new gate, since prosperity in a Khel and in its alliances depends considerably on this propitiousness of a gate. Death is the most inauspicious event. And the pollution emanating from it is the worst and may cause disaster if allowed to percolate auspicious occasions and rituals of good-sacredness. When pulling rituals commence, every care is taken to avoid anything and everything connected to death. If a person dies in the Khel when the pulling- installation genna has been imposed, no one in that house will perform the funeral rites; and no one from the Khel will visit the mourning. No one from the family of the deceased or anyone who happens to visit it will be permitted to take part in dragging rituals, and if they do, it is believed that the worst calamity will befall the entire Khel. Kharu separates the outside from inside, enemy from friend, wilderness from civilisation, and illness from prosperity. And lying at the confluence of these conceptual spheres, a gate is believed to protect its Khel from any untoward happening, provided all the rituals are sacrosanctly followed in its erection. A symbol of identity that it is, a gate never becomes a part of the day-to-day or routine life, regardless of the premiss that, paradoxically, it regulates the routine life of the Khel, though perpetually remaining in an animated sacred state. The sacredness of a gate commences with the selection of Kharu wood, achieves exaltation in dragging rituals, and with installation, it is permanently fixed. À Khel gate is always a sacred object- that is what an Angami believes ; and being eternally in that state, it provides the most appropriate place for keeping 'lucky stones'. Just outside the Kharukro (the wall of the gate), a few of them, called thago , can be seen placed. The thago near the Rudi Kharu is a grotesquely shaped stone with one of its sides developing in an awl. Stones having noticeable appearance, peculiar shape or are awe-inspiring are regarded the abode of spirits (Hutton, 1969 : 407), and it is believed that if they are placed in proxi- mity to the gate, they will diffuse their benign influence to the Khel. Commemorative stones laid by people of eminence or in their memory can also be kept near a gate. Close to Kidzii Kharu, for example, two stones lie, respectively called Sokratsie and Theyienyütsie- named after the men who put them, Hutton ( 1969 : 48) write? th^t near a gate, ß large</page><page sequence="34">92 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 stone called Kipuche, is often found : venerated at one time, this stone was an important part of head-hunting rituals. Being an embodiment of spiritual power, the gate is believed to be inhabited by spirits, and although touching it is not prohibited, any new carvings, paintings, or working on the carvings are not permitted on all days. An attempt to do so is to infuriate the Khel and also invite the wrath of the Kharu spirits. And Archer (1947) writes that people entering through the new gate offer the leaves of a 'sweet smelling herb' to it to keep off the spirit. No one is permitted to climb the gate. On an auspicions day (cacha) in the month of December (Rüde), when nothing in the Khel smacks of death, the gates are painted, repaired, in case necessary, and worshipped for looking after the welfare of people. To drive the enemies out, poisoned bamboo spikes are stuck close to the gate, and it is a taboo to touch them. The Kharu vouchsafes supernatural protection, and the panjis drive out enemies by wounding their feet, and thus fettering their movement. In addition to physical injury they may cause, the panjis are believed to be endowed with spiritual powers and at times of sickness, they are placed round the gate. Sickness, in the ethnomedical profile, is believed to be. caused by evil powers ; and the gate, bamboo spikes, lucky stones, kipuchi, the tree casting shadow on the gate, and the Kharukro are supposed to combat and exterminate the veneficous influences. It is a taboo to cut the branches of the tree in the neighbourhood of a gate. In the traditional system it is strongly believed that if an enemy intends to cast an evil influence, he will bury some spell-bound iron pieces near the gate. At one time, the people, through inspirational divination of dreams could find out if such pieces were buried anywhere near the gate. Panjis stuck near the gate are believed to parry all villianous entities emanating from the interned pieces of iron. At times of illness and epidemic, the entire system, guarding the Khel from bewitching influences and supernatural wrath, needs to be overhauled and freshened. In case several deaths occur in a Khel, it becomes essential to replace the old gate. XI From the foregoing description of various gates of Jotsoma, we abstract a general picture of the motifs that have been drawn on them and then proceed towards discussing the meaning of each one. Our conviction is that material culture should be treated as a symbol embodying the corpus of social relations on the one hand, and communicating the idioms of social structure on the other ; and, in this analysis, it needs to be considered a 'text', an understanding of which enables one to grasp the meanings that characterise the entire society. After emic categories of each of these motifs are defined, a relation- ghip befweeji them can be attempted, which shall present a pithy descrip-</page><page sequence="35">Marwah &amp; Sřivastava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 93 tion of the principles that having been meaningful in the traditional or Nanyü-centered system have fast occupied the niches of oblivion with the passage of 'great transformation'. Analysis of these motifs helps in reaching structural principles of the traditional society, because Kharu symbolism is a ramification of the array of Angami symbols. Descriptions and illustrations of Kigwema and Khonoma gates (see Hutton, 1969; and Fürer-Haimendorf, 1976) hive brought home the confi- gu rat ion al differences that exist between them and the gates of Jotsoma. But all the ten gates of Jotsoma are configurationally similar, except for variations with regard to number and types of weapons drawn within and without the mithan horns, the number of mithans, the number of heads oh the top row, etc. In other words, differences between one gate and the other are basically quantitative. Nevertheless, motifs drawn on a gate reflect certain characteristics of its Khel. The central importance in a gate is allocated to the warrior. He is, in most cases, not an ordinary soldier. He is a head-hunter, and in that role he saves the Khel people from threats and social calamities. But suppose the Khel does not have a head-hunter, a simple warrior is depicted on the gate. The gate is both a symbol of the Khel unity and is also a des- cription of the ritual and other achievements of a Khel : the circular head gear of horn bill feathers on the warrior, carving him with a head in his hand (right and/or left), or ornamenting him with vachu, show that there is at best one man in the Khel at the time of gate construction who has taken a head. A skirt is put if there is at least one pe;son in the Khel who has performed the Zhatho genna (for its description see, Hutton, 1969 : 231), but this person should be married (Archer, 1946-8). The semi-erect penis of the warrior depicts virility. In Jotsoma, a warrior is never shown outside the mithan horns. Enclosed fully or significantly in the case of horns, he is accompanied with various weapons that aid his activities of safeguarding the Khel people. Bulk of a gate is occupied by a mithan head. This 'magnificent' domestic animal (Hutton, 1969 : 79) occupies an important position in the Naga social system, and the Angamis, even now, invest a lot of wealth fo r acquiring it. Sociological importance of mithan in this society is not conditioned by its utilitarian value. As we have seen , besides its head, there are some drawings of mithans on the lower portion of a gate. The size of mithan horns, drawn in the centre, is very big if the Khel has a performer of the lesü (or lishe) genna. Breasts can also be carved if this condition is fulfilled. All these rules show that the new Kharu is not a blind imitation of the old one, but ritual and war achievements of the Khel members at the time of construction are incorporated in it. An important aspect is that the symbolic representations of the açhiçvç-</page><page sequence="36">94 Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 ments of few are shared by all the members of a Khel- personal achive- ments of the great warrior are equally shared by the Khel collectivity. In this sense, the gate of a Khel- erected and replaced at different points of time - may be conceptualized as a book of laurels. Why is the head-hunter drawn ? What does it communicate ? It was not only the stratificational fact - the warrior commanded respect and honour- that gave impetus to head- huntings but the belief that it 'contributed to the fertility of their womenfolk and the prosperity of their field' (Sema, 1986 : 9) was of paramount importance. The social context of incessant and endless feuds was instrumental in keeping the cult of head-hunting alive till quite recently. The head-hunter symbolised valour, chivalry, strength, indefatigable power and an uninterrupted commitment to the cause. But he was not necessarily a man of 'great gennas or one who had given feasts or merit (Ngieyhakezhüzhü) : in other words, head- hunting was independent of ritual attainments. When it came to depic- ting strength on the one hand, and ritual achivements on the other, both were fused in a Naga who was a 'warrior' as well as a 'man of genna.' However in this amalgamation, the ritual proscriptions- the gennas- had priority over the display of intrepidity. Saphilie Gwirie recalled that even the last warrior and head-hunter of his Khel (II), Pfükranyü (son of Jühumvü), who was remembered for having visited many villages in head-hunting expeditions, was not allowed to move out of the Khel during the genna days. The warrior brought from a war the heads of his enemies. Did he bring them to prove to others his merits ? Or, to keep them as trophies of achievements ? Yes, a pragmatic reasoning was always there : head was brought back from wars as a proof as it was difficult to carry the entire body of the slain. But perhaps the beliefs related to head and body were quite important. According to the Angami eschatology, a headless man could not reach the abodes of the dead, and It was in head that there existed the seat of the soul (Gohain, 1977 : 29-30; Hodson, 1984). There- fore, if 'fertilising soul substance' was needed, the sole way to acquire it was by bringing the head. Till the time, the head existed, there was no opportunity for the soul to depart. It would keep floating, and once fixed, would look after the welfare of people by driving away other evil spirits. Thus, the meaning of a head lies at two levels : it is connected to ferility cult, and the soul resting in it can be made to supervise the well-being of a Khel. In this framework, the meaning of the top row of heads can be discussed. There are four, five, or six heads carved as a top row on each gatf. They represent the heads hunted by the warrior, who after accomplishing this feat adorns himself with a circular head-gear. There is no relationship between the npmber of heads dfa^n op the top row and the</page><page sequence="37">Marwah &amp; Srivasíava] Khel Gate and Social Structure 95 cases of head hunting in the Khel. A school teacher of Khel-III said that these heads in the top row are 'representatives of their prayers regarding an increase in population.' An elder of Khel-IV informed that each head symbolises the spirit of the head hunted in a war and fixed on a gafe. It forcibly averts the powers that dwell in to cast an evil eye. These two local explanations may be put together to understand the symbolic representation of these heads, but emphasis on an increase of population and prevalence of prosperity is always more. Depiction of the moon and the sun is a beseechment to favourable weather. It is prayed that till they wander in the cosmos, there will be no dearth of vital resources needed for life. Symbolising nature, both the moon and the sun - treated as having conjugal relations- are equally important in the Angami Oath, which even now in some cases is the fundamental method to decide the questions of fact. Ears of paddy, drawn in some gates below the celestial couple, symbolise bounteous paddy and other victual. Weapons carved and/or drawn on a gate show a great deal of variation. Traditional weapons, coupled with the modern, collectively symbolise the 'artillery' at a warrior's command. Breasts carved below the mithan head are interpreted in terms of fertility cult. However, an Angami lecturer from Jakhama said that here the underlying idea was that in the 'absence of cow's milk, one can subsist on that of the mother's,' and also that in some cases, 'mother's milk is superior to that of the cow's.' XII It is clear from the above discussion that motifs engraved or drawn on a Khel door form a meaningful system. They are not to be dispensed with in terms of the fin-de-siecle aestheticism of 'art for art's sake'. Understood as a meaningful system, various premisses of the Kharu symbolism can be systematised in the following categories, a. Characterising unity of a Khel, each Kharu is an explicit demonstra- tion of head-hunting. It is here that it can be studied as a 'book of laurels', giving an idea of what the Khel people have collectively achieved. Certain aspects of the social structure can be worked out from studying various symbols like, hornbill feather on head gears, skirt, breasts, big horns, etc. As fertility is a central theme to head- hunting and the display of heads, the relation between the top row of heads and the warrior encased in mitban horns is that of fertility and bravery. Achievements of : Warrior : : Fertility : Bravery the warrior (Rükho- (Rütsü) umia) : : Expansion : Safety against evil and of Khel jealous forces</page><page sequence="38">% Indian Anthropologist [17, 1987 b. The central and the latter part of Kharu, beginning with the mithan head to meyhakhu, is an enlargement of the theme of expansion. Here all motifs demonstrate the sentiments of a Khel's prosperity and happiness over time. In traditional times, Kharu spirits were prayed for an increase in both human and cattle population. People were interested in their demographic increase because mortality rate at that time was very high (see, Hutton, 1969: 55) and feuds between different Khels and villages further accentuated it. Prayer for a demographic increase of mithan was because of the place this animal occupied in the Angami society. In Kidzü Kharu, both these ideas are enshrined below the mithans shown on its two sides : No lhouchalie (further prosperity of human population) and Perikrolie (further prosperity of animals). c. Designs on a Kharu integrate a number of unlike elements, though interwoven in a common theme. They are asymmetrical and when there is a repetition of a motif (e.g., mithan), its dimensions differ. Having not much of empty space, a Kharu has few figures (like that of a war- rior) that are enclosed; others are without enclosures. Following Barry's (1952, 57) pioneering work on social conditions and general features of style, and Fischer's hypotheses (1961 : 8 L) pertaining to art designs and social organisation (also see, Merrill, 1987 : 221-30), it may be arrived at that the Angami society is hierarchial. It is only in light of the last hypothesis of Fischer 16 that the streaks of egalitarianism are visible in the Angami society. It is corroborated by the fact that there is no chief of the entire tribe or Khel/village lord. Although the gate symbolism is oriented towards the welfare of all, the gate cannot resist inequalities based on social status and physical power, to find a place in various designs. XIII The manifest function of a gate was of fortification, thus protecting a Khel from its enemies. At the latent level, it reinforced Solidarity of a Khel as, it has been discussed earlier, tasks of constructing and installing a door were the prerogatives of the Khel people. In days when head-hunting was prevalent and amity between different. Khels, villages and tribes was not an easy affair, ä gate and its functionaries like, Chowkidar and the 'great warrior' exercised surveillance on the entire Khel. After checking arrival of all inhabitants, the gates were closed. A man from Jakhama informed that in the past it was imperative for a person to return to his Khel, in case he went away for sometime, ánd some 'supernaturalism' was associated with it. Had this not been there, he said that the Angamis 'would have gone till Dimapur'. In olden times, entry points to the Khels were through these gates, but now new paàsagfes and routes have come up and passing in and out through a gate has lost the sacrosanct value. With an addition of open networks and</page><page sequence="39">Marwah &amp; Šrivastava] Khèl Gate and Social Structuré "97 increase in geographical mobility, the Khel requires new avenues of creating solidarity, rather than those that were 'functional' in the head- hunting days. In Jotsoma, it was in 1976 that a gate of Khel-I was replaced. Since then no gate has been either replaced or repaired, and very emphatically the people say that in future there are no chances of any gates being replaced. Gate-pulling rituals fall in the realm of tradition, one which has not been selected by modernity for its reinforcement. Relegation of gate-pulling rituals to the background is because of two reasons : a. The functional value of a gate has attenuated. b. The gate as a 'book of laurels' and a 'collective prayer for the prospe- rity of both people and domestic animals' was meaningful in pristine (nodes of social organisation. Once this society started transforming as a consequence of modernisation and an acceptance of Christianity, the ideological bulwarks of gates have crumbled. Mass acceptance of Christianity has worked against the continuation of traditional symbols, rituals, and festal occasions. Although some traditional lore survive with the Christian beliefs and practices, gate.pulling, not needed functionally as well as symbolically, has come to an end. It is precisely because of this that people have to wrestle with their memory to provide piecemeal, intermittent, and fading informations about the dragging rituals and ceremonies.
