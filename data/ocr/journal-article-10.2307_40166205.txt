<plain_text><page sequence="1">Failure, Pride, and Conversion in Inferno I: A Reinterpretation ANTHONY K. CASSELL "Wass hinkt der Kerl auf einem Fuss?" must now be clear to all Dantisti that the Wayfarer's first attempt to climb a mountain in Inferno I represents a conversion manquee. Charles Singleton's essays have shown that the image of the Exodus as a figure of conversion gives form to the metaphors of the opening canto as well as to the whole journey up the moun- tain of Purgatory.1 In a seminal article John Freccero demonstrated that Dante's puzzling "firm foot" represents the spiritual left "foot" of the soul, the passions and will wounded by the Fall. Dante is homo claudus, limping man dragging the affective or sensitive soul behind him as he vainly attempts to make headway.2 Freccero in a later essay compared the hill of the prologue to the deceptive hollow mountain in St. Augustine's De beata vita, a mountain which proud, unwary philosophers scaled only to perish as they fell to perdition through its specious surface.3 Colin Hardie proposed that this "colle" was not to be identified with Purgatory but with Mount Ida in Inferno xiv, under which the Veglio di Creta weeps standing upon his foot of clay.4 This critic argued provocatively that to take the hill of Inferno I and II as anything but a constrast with the mount of Purgatory turned the symbolism of the Antipodes into nonsense; and he asked, "Is it too bold to suggest that the 'bel monte' of I</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 Inferno I and II is or duplicates Mount Ida, and that Virgil in Inferno xiv expounds what is inside its delusive interior?" (p. 92). That this colle of Inferno I is a negative symbol is merely part of what I hope to show here. That Dante backslides is clear, but there is much confusion in Dante criticism concerning, first, the degree of his progress toward conversion (symbolic of that also recorded in the Vita nuova) and, secondly, the manner and extent of his back- sliding. Dante's failure at the end of the first sixty lines of the Divina Commedia critics have tended to ascribe merely to the weakness of the will and lower soul5 and have not sufficiently stressed the hindrances to the proper functioning of the intellect. Only when we take this into consideration can we comprehend the true nature of Dante's failure in the prologue scene. Too little has been said of the presence in Inferno I of mankind's first sin, the silent sin of pride, in spite of the fact that Dante acknowledges it especially as his own besetting sin. Since superbia is the initium omnis peccati, should we not look for its effects there where the poem begins? In the purgatorial cornice of pride Dante bows his head and goes side by side with Omberto Aldobrandesco as "oxen go in a yoke"; and although Virgil bids him to hasten on, the pilgrim's thoughts remain "bent down and shrunk" (Purg. xn, 1-9). In the canto fol- lowing, the Wayfarer specifically exonerates himself of envy but confesses his dread of the punishment of superbia in the cornice he has just passed through: Troppa e piu la paura ond'e sospesa l'anima mia del tormento di sotto, che gia lo'ncarco di la giu mi pesa. {Purg. xiii, 136-138) Dante recognizes in himself the sin of pride and there anticipates its purgation. The prologue scene prepares us for this revelation. Among others, David Thompson, like Bruno Nardi before him, has seen a consuming devotion to philosophy at the expense of theology in the works Dante wrote between the Vita nuova and the Commedia.6 The Commedia in Nardi's view is a recantation of the Convivio and the De monarchia and a return to Beatrice and to the Christian charity she figures. For Nardi the "dark wood" of Inferno I is Dante's smarrimento into philosophy. David Thompson inter- 2</page><page sequence="3">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL prets Dante's first unsuccessful attempt as parallel to Ulysses1 voy- age in Inferno xxvi and he contrasts both these journeys to Dante's descent and subsequent successful climb up the Mount of Purga- tory: "Ulysses' voyage is an image of the misguided philosophical Odyssey; and Dante's dream in Purgatory xix dramatizes how he saw the light with the aid of Virgil and Beatrice." This critic believes that the Convivio was left unfinished because "it represented a via non vera that led towards spiritual shipwreck: Philosophy could not do what Boethius' lady had claimed; Dante must make a different journey, the Augustinian journey into the self" (pp. 53-54). All of the critics I have mentioned have led toward an inevitable reinterpretation of Canto I. Each of them is right, I believe, in seeing that the Divina Commedia reflects a change in Dante's thought and a retreat from a position which he believed unchristian and untenable. Dante's troubles at the outset depict the divine judgment upon one who, in self-reliance, devotes himself to philosophy alone with- out attention to theology, that is, to the Christian facts of the Fall, Redemption and Grace. The major moral and allegorical sense of the opening canto of the Commedia is that Dante is the backsliding sinner proudly seeking to mount up to justice without the in- dispensable gift of Grace. The unfolding of the scene faithfully reflects the conventions and paradigms of the Christian concept of pride. Behind the Wayfarer's difficulties lies what St. Augustine viewed as the "pride of philosophers," the intellectual arrogance of pagan Platonists, Stoics, and others who would mount to Truth, to Bliss, to Heaven trusting in their own ability alone without realizing or admitting that they needed the grace of Christ to succeed.7 Such an attempt was the result of inflated glorifying in one's own ex- istence, and St. Augustine and his followers through the Middle Ages saw it as a repetition of the sin of Lucifer, Adam, and the Titans who aspired beyond measure and undeservedly to be sicut dii.s Dante's failure as he "ruins down" in basso loco imitates their fall. The repudiated corto andar is the ancient way of Eros, of those who, metaphorically or literally, dared to take heaven by storm. Indeed it is for a sin of the intellect, not the flesh, for which Beatrice first reproaches him later in Purgatorio xxx. Her first words iron- ically rebuke Dante for following the presumption and vainglory of 3</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 philosophers; not of himself does he come, but through her agency in the chain of grace is he made worthy to climb the mountain: Come degnasti d'accedere al monte? non sapei tu che qui e l'uom felice? (vv. 74-75) Her initial concern is man's ultimate and eternal happiness, the goal from which Dante had strayed when he had abandoned her, the spiritual guide, who was to lead him to it: "Questi si tolse a me, e diessi altrui." He had followed instead another woman whom he allegorized as a Boethian "donna gentile" of pure philosophy. Bea- trice continues in lines which clearly refer this truancy back to the events of the prologue scene, to the Wayfarer's "diritta via smar- rita," to his ruining down to the depths, to the descent of Grace, and to the necessity of the journey through Hell: e volse i passi suoi per via non vera, Tanto giu cadde, che tutti argomenti a la salute sua eran gia corti, fuor che mostrarli le perdu te genti. (vv. 130-138) Later in Purgatorio xxxm, she makes her charges clearer: "Perche conoschi," disse, "quella scuola c'hai seguitata, e veggi sua dottrina come pud seguitar la mia parola; e veggi vostra via da la divina distar cotanto, quanto si discorda da terra il ciel che piu alto festina." (vv. 85-90) The pilgrim, now having drunk of Lethe's waters of forgetfulness, recalls nothing. But as Beatrice points out, since only sins and not good deeds are thus blotted out, had it not been a sin to have left her to follow this "school," Dante would have recalled all. Before this cleansing he had as a cure to descend into Hell to see those in perdition- among them the pagan poets and philosophers compris- ing the scuola into whose number Dante had proudly seen himself received {Inf. iv, 102). In Purgatorio xxi, 31-33, Virgil confesses his 4</page><page sequence="5">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL own pagan limitations and those of his companions in Limbo em- ploying the same term: "Io fui tratto fuor de l'ampia gola/ d'inferno per mostrarli, e mosterolli/ oltre, quanto '1 potra menar mia scola." Beatrice's negative, use puts Virgil's earlier positive use into per- spective; for her it describes those who persist in the mistaken belief that man's ultimate happiness can be attained without the true wisdom of God's grace. And it was of Virgil's pagan school that Dante the Wayfarer was made the proud sixth member "fra cotanto senno." The poet, on the other hand, writing with the total ex- perience of the journey to justice and of the very sight of God, refuses to recount the substance of the conversation of the six: il tacere e bello. Thus, a study of the author's references to a pagan "scuola" of which the Wayfarer is made a part leads us to under- stand that Dante's failure in Inferno I results not merely from the weaknesses, concupiscence and ignorance, of all men who bear the mark of Adam, but also from a private failing of Dante himself: a personal sin of pride. When in Purgatorio xxx, the Wayfarer receives this scolding, he has been purged of the "peccati" on his forehead; he stands on his two feet in the Earthly Paradise where original justice, or the right ordering of the soul, was lost by Adam, and where the rational governance of his own soul is regained through personal justice.9 As in the prologue scene ("il pie fermo"), here also an allusion to the feet reflects the pilgrim's progress. The angels are singing Psalm 30 (Vulgate) but stop at the words "pedes meos" {Purg. xxx, 84). The Poet specifies that they sing no further than these words, for he wants our minds to wander back over the verse to its beginning "in loco spatioso statuisti pedes meos."10 If the significance of the line from the Psalm remains opaque to the reader of the present day, we will do well to seek what the line signified in the tradition which Dante inherited. St. Augustine's exegesis particularly can be most revealing, for he makes the "spacious place" a place of justice and contrasts the feet of the just with the limping foot of the unre- deemed. "Ergo quid ait, 'Posuisti in loco spatioso pedes meos'? Plane fecisti mihi facilem justitiam, quae mihi erat aliquando difficilis."11 The exegete begins his interpretation of the Psalm according to its title as a song of rapture and ecstasy, and quoting St. Paul he addresses us: " 'Sive enim mente excessimus Deo, sive temperantes 5</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, xciv, 2976 sumus vobis, charitas enim Christi compellit nos (il Cor. 5:13-14). Hoc est, si ea tantum agere vellemus, et ea tantum contemplari quae mentis excessu intuemur, vobiscum non essemus, sed essemus in supernis, tanquam contemptis vobis: et quando nos ad ilia superiora et interiora infirmo passu sequeremini, nisi rursus compellente nos charitate Christi . . . nos consideraremus esse servos."12 The Saint insists on halting man's need of God's grace to descend to humility so that he might by charity rise to justice and bliss. He considers lameness the opposite of justice and allies the two concepts in his imagery just as Dante does some thousand years later. Is it incidental that in Purgatorio xxi, 7-11, when Statius, that semi-guide, appears, our attention is also drawn to Dante's feet: "Ed ecco . . ./ ci apparve un'ombra, e dietro noi venia,/ dal pie guardando la turba che giace ...."? Such imagery in the Divine Comedy involves not only Beatrice and Statius, however. Later, in Paradiso xxxii, 4-6, the last of Dante's guides, St. Bernard, begins his tutoring of the Wayfarer by pointing to Eve sitting at the feet of St. Mary and by referring to the wound of nature: "La piaga che Maria richiuse e unse,/ quella ch'e tanto bella da' suoi piedi/ e colei che l'aperse e che la punse." In a Christian context, and thus in Dante's, it is fitting that Eve, once fallen and now redeemed, sit at St. Mary's feet, for through Her came man's Salvation just as through Eve all mankind suffers in the foot for pride. Significantly, this is the last use of the word "piede" in the Divina Commedia. Feet and pride, then, play a symbolic part not only at the ap- pearance of Beatrice but also at that of Statius and Bernard. Looking back to the prologue scene, we notice that when Virgil first answers Dante, he identifies himself by parentage and birth, but speaks the most curious lines (vv. 73-78) when he gives his identity as poet: "Poeta fui, e cantai di quel giusto figliuol d'Anchise che venne di Troia, Poi che '1 superbo Ili'on fu combusto. Ma tu perche ritorni a tanta noia? perche non sali il dilettoso monte ch'e principio e cagion di tutta gioia?" It can be no accident that as we read these lines we believe for a fleeting moment, implicitly, not explicitly, that "tanta noia" 6</page><page sequence="7">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL (rhyming with "Troia") refers to Dante's escape and desire to re- turn to a destruction caused by pride, to the suffering of the razed city; but then we comprehend Virgil's meaning as he continues and refers to the climbing of a "delightful mountain" (Inf. I, 77). We may puzzle at the ambiguity and wonder why Aeneas is named only with a circumlocution. Why does Dante here emphasize An- chises and "proud Troy" and not Aeneas' voyage and the founding of Rome, the chief material of the Aeneid?13 Lameness and pride are sufficient reasons for Dante. Anchises was crippled because he had proudly boasted that his son had been born of Venus; the old man's infirmity forced Aeneas to bear him on his shoulders from the flames of proud Ilium.14 A pattern now becomes discernible. At the appearance of all the guides party to this descent of grace the Poet in some way refers to the foot, to lameness, and to pride. As the guides signify the work- ing of divine grace, so the foot signifies the helplessness of man left to himself. The symbolism is consistent, and Dante thereby reminds us of the necessity of these guides in aiding the pilgrim and throws their absence in the prologue scene into sharp relief. The word piede becomes charged with ever more meaning as the poem progresses. The final usage invites us to contemplate that "pie fermo" in Inferno I where the journey begins. Dante standing with his weight on his firm foot cannot there hold his ground; his fear subsides and he lacks humility; he is forced back to where the sun is silent. In this he resembles St. Bernard's description of the proud sinner, who cannot stand for long, leaning with his weight on only one foot: "Non veniat mihi pes superbiae" (Psal. XXXV: 12). Superbia enim non nisi unum pedem habet, propriae amorem excellentiae: et ideo superbus diu stare non potest, tanquam qui non nisi unipedi innititur. Quis enim staret in illo pede, in quo ceciderunt qui opera ti sunt iniquitatem, angelus in coelo, homo in paradiso?15 There in Inferno I on the via non vera, where progress toward God was impossible, the word was singular in number, pie fermo. In Purgatorio xxx, 84, on the path of justice it is the plural, pedes meos. Even Dante's use of the singular and plural forms part of the pattern; for pride has one foot, humility has two: Ut ergo secure stare valeas, sta in humilitate; sta, non in uno pede super- 1</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 biae, sed in pedibus humilitatis, ut non moveantur vestigia tua. Humilitas enim duos habet pedes; considerationem divinae potentiae, et propriae infirmitatis. O speciosi pedes, et firmi, nee tenebris ignorantiae involute nee lubrico luxuriae inquinati! Tu ergo in alto positus, noli altum sapere, sed time.16 The uses of pie we noted above are singular until the cure of concupiscence and ignorance is reached in the place of humility and justice. Thereafter it is plural: Inferno I: pie; Statius: pie; Beatrice: pedes; St. Bernard: piedi. The Poet's combination of the images of a weary pilgrim strug- gling for conversion yet succumbing to the wound of pride is common in Christian literature. St. Bernard, whom Dante chooses as the Wayfarer's last guide to the peace of Heaven, had also depicted himself in the De gradibus as just such a viator with the identical shortcomings: his journey occurs in an almost identical setting, at the same time of year; he mentions a delay for rest, and he suffers from the same sluggish limp. The chapter (appropriately but, perhaps, not significantly, number nine) is entitled "Gemitus et suspiria s. B. veritatem anhelantis": Tu quidem, Domine, gressus meos dinumeras, sed ego lentus ascensor, fessus viator, diverticula quaero. Vae mihi, si tenebrae me comprehendant, aut si mea fuga fiat in hieme, vel in sabbato: dum nunc ad lucem, cum tempus acceptabile et dies salutis sunt, proficisci dissimulo. Quid moror? Ora pro me, fili, frater, socie, et particeps profectus mei, si quis est, in Domino. Ora Omnipotentem, quatenus sic pigrum roboret pedem, ut tamen non veniat mihi pes superbiae. Etsi enim pes piger, ut ad veritatem ascendat, idoneus non est: tolerabilior tamen est isto, qui in ea stare non potest, ut habes ibi, Expulsi sunt, nee potuerunt stare. Et hoc quidem de superbis.17 The Saint then rejoices in his own infirmity and in the mark of Adam's sin (O felix culpa!): Libenter igitur et ego, Domine Jesu, gloriabor, si potero, in mea inf irmitate, in mei nervi contractione, ut tua virtus, id est humilitas, perficiatur in me. Nam sufficit mihi gratia tua, cum defecerit virtus mea. Pedem profecto gratiae fortiter figens, et meum qui infirmus est, leniter trahens, securus ascendam per scalam humilitatis: donee veritati adhaerens, ad latitudinem transeam charitatis. Tune psallam cum gratiarum actione, et dicam: "Sta- tuisti in loco spatioso pedes meos." Sic arcta via cautius strictim inceditur, 8</page><page sequence="9">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL sic ardua scala tutius pedetentim ascenditur; sic miro modo ad veritatem licet pigrius tamen firmius claudicando acceditur.18 Upon his own successful conversion to justice, Bernard reflects Augustine in singing the very Psalm the Angels will sing in Pur- gatorio XXX; in each case a single foot which cannot stand is con- trasted to the two feet which stand in justice. The keystone to the metaphors is that pride is a foot and this observation will, as we shall see, suggest that in Inferno I Dante's foot may also lead to pride. To be more precise, the Poet is assuming our familiarity with the image of the pes superbiae of Psalm 35:12 (Vulgate). An examination of the way this image had been received and used by previous Christian writers can help us put Dante's conception into historical perspective. Psalm 35 was a prayer of the newly converted that they be saved from self-satisfaction and vainglory. St. Augustine in his exegesis of it refers to superbia, the initium omnis peccati, to original sin, the wound of nature and to the fall of the proud to the depths. His comment on this biblical line in fact foreshadows the failure of Dante's first conversion in Inferno I: "Non veniat mihi pes superbiae" .... Cum coeperit quisque isto fonte uberius irrigari, caveat ne superbiat. Non enim deerat Adae primo homini: sed venit illi pes superbiae, et movit ilium manus peccatoris, id est manus diaboli superba. Quomodo ille qui eum seduxit, dixit, "Ponam sedem meam ad Aquilonem" (Isai. XIV: 13): sic illi persuasit, "Gustate, et eritis sicut dii" (Gen. ill: 5). Superbia ergo lapsi sumus, ut ad istam mortalitatem perveniremus. Et quia nos superbia vulneraverat, humilitas facit sanos. Venit humilis Deus, ut a tanto superbiae vulnere curaret hominem. [....] Quare autem valde hoc times? Quasi diceretur, "Ibi ceciderunt omnes qui operantur iniquitatem"; ut venirent ad illam abyssum, de qua dictum est, "Judicia tua sicut abyssus multa"; ut ad illud profundum pervenirent, ubi peccatores qui contemnunt, ceciderunt. "Ceciderunt": ubi primo cecider- unt? In pede superbiae. Audite pedem superbiae: "Qui cum cognovissent Deum, non sicut Deum glorificaverunt." Venit ergo illis pes superbiae unde venerunt in profundum .... Quare ilium pedem dixit? Quia superbiendo Deum deseruit, et discessit: pedem ipsius affectum ipsius dixit .... Ser- pens observat quando tibi veniat pes superbiae, quando labaris, ut dejiciat; tu autem caput ejus observa: initium omnis peccati superbia (Ecclus. X: 15). "Ibi ceciderunt qui operantur iniquitatem: expulsi sunt, nee potuerunt stare": prior ille qui in veritate non stetit, deinde per eum illi quos dimisit Deus de paradise19 9</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 We have already cited St. Bernard's account in the De gradibus of a successful conversion completed with the special aid of grace freely given; he too prays lest a "foot of pride" prevent him from standing in the truth just as St. Augustine had given a warning lest the foot of pride come to us as it came to Adam and Eve. Dante's lot in Inferno I reflects the imagery of the Saints: the Wayfarer cannot mount up with his "firm foot" and ill holds his ground: like the proud he is cast down, nee potuit stare (Ps. 35:13). Dante is indeed homo claudus left to himself and bearing the wound of nature; for like all men he has a "pes piger," a foot infirm inflicted upon Adam and his progeny by an envious devil. But he suffers not only from this original wound of pride but also from the sin exacerbated by his own commission. His personal, disordinate seeking of the heights itself provides the proof; Dante's very climb here is wrong: "Quid est autem superbia nisi perversae celsitudinis appetitus?"20 The un- successful ascent of Canto I is an allegory of philosophical pride; through it Dante was led to a sinful sense of self-sufficiency and had departed from Christ's charity. Thus in addition to the identification that Professor Freccero has given for Dante's "pie fermo," should not a further identification be made? In the metaphors of the Church, the "foot of pride" comes to the Wayfarer and he falls. The exploration and inquiry into several other details of the scene can deepen our understanding of the place which pride holds in Inferno I. First, let us consider the glance to the heights. The "pia- neta" of verse 17 is clearly the light of truth and justice, and a glance to the light traditionally denotes desire for conversion.21 But it is imperative to correct the impression of some Dantisti that the Wayfarer here glances to the source of light, the sun.22 For a com- plete comprehension of the Wayfarer's failure and of the Poet's purpose we must realize that he does not do so; he gazes not upon the sun itself but upon a hill clothed with the sun's rays: Guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle vestite gia de' raggi del pianeta che mena dritto altrui per ogni calle. (vv. 16-18) Nowhere here are we told that his eyes are lifted directly to the "pianeta." "Others" are led aright by the sun but not the Wayfarer. 10</page><page sequence="11">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL Dante insists on the distinction, for theology makes much of it. St. Augustine, for example, has a great deal to say about those who look merely to the mountains for their help and no further. One of his statements from the Confessions x, viii, 15, Petrarch was to choose as a climax to the "Ascent of Mont Ventoux": "Et eunt homines mirari alta montium . . . et relinquunt se ipsos."23 But we find St. Augustine's clearest warning in his Enarratio in Psalmum 35, mentioned before: "Justitia tua sicut montes Dei: judicia tua sicut abyssus multa." Qui sunt montes Dei? . . . magni praedicatores, montes Dei. Et quomodo, quando oritur sol, prius luce montes vestit, et inde lux ad humillima terrarum descendit: sic quando venit Dominus noster Jesus Christus, prius radiavit in altitudinem Apostolorum, prius illustravit montes, et sic descendit lux ejus ad convallum terrarum. Et ideo quodam loco dicit in psalmo: "Levavi oculos meos in montes, unde veniet auxilium mihi." Sed noli putare, quia ipsi montes tibi dabunt auxilium: accipiunt enim quod dent, non de suo dant. Et si remanseris in montibus, non erit firma spes tua: sed in illo qui illuminat montes spes tua et praesumptio tua debet esse.24 Dante's reflection of Augustine's anthropomorphic image in "spalle vestite" (the hill in the way of hills and men, of course, has a pie) should have pointed us beyond in its suggestion that this was a "man-mountain."25 The Saint can help us still further: "Notice how the Psalm proceeds: 'I have lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence my help shall come to me.' What then? Do the moun- tains give you help? Not at all."26 Dante's mountain likewise has no light of itself. The Wayfarer has not gazed at the source but upon a pale reflection. St. Augustine's warning continues with an identifica- tion even more perilous, and he uses the image of the shipwrecked soul later employed by Dante; false thinkers and heresiarchs can also be puffed and towering mountains misleading and driving men to perdition: Erant montes alii, per quos unusquisque cum duceret navim, naufragium faceret. Emerserunt enim principes haeresum, et montes erant. Arius mons erat, Donatus mons erat, Maximianus modo quasi mons factus est. Multi in istos montes attendentes, et terram desiderantes, cum de fluctibus volunt liberari, ad saxa compulsi sunt, et naufragium in terra fecerunt.27 Keeping St. Augustine's warning in mind, we come to see that the II</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 Poet clearly intends to show us that something is wrong with the Wayfarer's actions and direction. The path he pursues in Inferno I, 1-61, is not the verace via he has abandoned. The right road does not lead up this mountain, for the path he is following is one to which not from which he has strayed. Dante nowhere faces in the right direction until Virgil comes and directs him to another path. Alone he can only journey in confusion and error; he wanders in invio, et non in via. Dante simply cannot see his way without the admonishment of a guide sent by divine aid.28 Without grace he suffers both from concupiscence and from the other wound of original sin, ignorance. Not only is his lower affective soul cor- rupted, but his very faculty for conceiving the truth lacks its full strength and vigor. Recent Dante criticism has neglected the presence of ignorance in the prologue scene, yet it is fundamental to the comprehension of the Wayfarer's failure. St. Bernard warns us not to forget its serious- ness on the path of our life: "Et ne hoc [state of ignorance] leve existimes, memineris scriptum, quia ignorans ignorabitur. Scire vis quid consulam et in hac necessitate? Quod in prima. Meo consilio nunc quoque ibis ad Verbum, et docebit te vias suas, ne volendo quidem, sed ignorando bonum, dum curris, contingat excurrere et errare in invio, et non in via."27 The Wayfarer's intellect lacks the ability to see the light. Here also Dante's poetic conception has a clear dogmatic basis; Hugh of St. Victor outlines the punishments of original sin: In illo quippe spiritus per superbiam contra Creatorum tumens obedien- tiam non tenuit; et idcirco creato ad ulciscendam injuriam suam spiritum quidem ignorantia, carnem vero concupiscentia damnavit, ut in se bonum agendum non videat; in carne autem sua malum agere concupiscat. Haec duo vitia ad puniendam superbiam hominis juste in ipso confirmantur. Ignorantia quidem, dum ab animo subtrahitur lumen veritatis; concupis- centia vero, dum caro percutitur poena mortalitatis.30 Concupiscence and ignorance are the two afflictions we inherit from Adam- precisely how the corruption of the flesh is transmitted to the mind or rational soul, Hugh confesses, is difficult to explain, and in fact, he leaves it a question de fide, not compassable by human reason.31 Nevertheless, mankind's intellect, though itself un- 12</page><page sequence="13">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL touched, participates in ignorance; babes naturally born without knowledge are "born into that vice by which afterwards they are hindered from knowledge of the truth." Thus, according to Hugh, in "this carnal sense man cannot drink in pure truth without confu- sion and error."32 The darkness of ignorance in the mind (animus: animo) which resulted from the fall is specifically the punishment of pride: Ignorantia poena fuit elationis, concupiscentia effectus mortalitatis. Ita quatuor mala in homine apparent: superbia, ignorantia, mortalitas, con- cupiscentia. Superbia mentis culpa tantum; mortalitas carnis poena tan- tum; ignorantia culpa et poena in mente; concupiscentia poena et culpa in carne. Propter elationem animus obscuratus est per ignorantiam, propter mortalitatem caro emollita per concupiscentiam. Quia enim animus per elationem contra Deum tumuit, ignorantia percussus lumen veritatis am- isit. Quia vero caro mortalitate percussa est, ipsa sui languoris infirmitate dissoluta extra mensuram primae dispositionis desideria sua extendit. Haec est enim ipsa quae carnis concupiscentia vocatur, naturalis scilicet ap- petitus sive affectus ordinem transgrediens et mensuram transcendens. Ordinem transgrediens, quando movetur ad ea quae non debet; mensuram transcendens, quando movetur aliter quam debet.™ Dante fails not simply because he is driven back by the lupa, a figure of his disposition toward concupiscence, but because like all men after the Fall, even from the beginning he does not see the light of truth clearly. Through ignorance Dante will fail to gaze directly at the sun and will eventually lose even its reflected light. His climb without grace is an exceeding of the measure of man and is in consequence a climb of pride; he will eventually be driven back to where "the sun is silent": "Dove il sol tace" (v. 61). The puzzle of this striking synaesthetic image can also be resolved if we read the opening of the Commedia according to the theme of pride. Superbia the first of all sins is not a sin of action but a sin of thought and this fact is basic to Dante's metaphor and diction. Pride is the conceit of the new convert waxing arrogant over his own holiness: behavior after the first stage of a conversion is most critical for pernicious and devious superbia steals into the secret, silent thoughts to work its evil. In this the sinner reflects the first com- mission of pride, that of Lucifer, which was in thought alone. The devil performed no act, for as an angel he was pure intellect, and in 13</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, xciv, 2976 the intellect he is punished by ignorance.34 The Church Fathers emphasize pride as a silent sin and in this regard the warnings of St. Gregory the Great to the newly converted can be of great aid to us: "Scimus autem quia aliquando minus est in corporis corrup- tionem cadere quam cogitatione tacita ex deliberata elatione pec- care; sed cum minus turpis superbia creditur, minus vitatur."35 Though we did not at first see it, Dante's fixed attention on the mountain and not on the sun was of profound importance; in another place Gregory returns to the same theme using the same language: "At contra cum subjectorum cor superbia instigat, hoc summopere nititur agere, ut sua acta considerare funditus negligant, et semper tacitis cogitationibus rectoris sui judices fiant .... Unde et tanto atrocius pereunt, quanto a se oculus avertunt, quia in hujus vitae itinere offendentes corruunt, dum alibi intendunt."36 Having failed to look at the sun, the traditional image of the risen Christ, the Logos, the Word, the Wayfarer is pushed back into darkness just as the fallen angels, deprived of the light of truth, remained in the darkness of pride.37 The "sun's silence" then figures ignorance, the punishment and darkness of superbia. Like that of all men, Dante's soul suffers evil "such that unless aided by grace, it can neither receive knowledge of the truth nor resist concupiscence of the flesh."38 The glance to the hill bathed in light illustrates his purblind ignorance just as the arrival of the three beasts, particularly the lupa, will later reveal his disposition to concupiscence. Dante as post-lapsarian man, not only climbs in a halting manner, but with an unaided and impeded intellect he chooses the wrong mountain to climb, a mountain in this northern "vedovo sito" instead of Pur- gatory's southerly Mount of Justice in the Antipodes. Though his glance aloft reveals his desire for conversion, he cannot be success- ful alone; bereft of divine help in his climb he transgresses the measure of man and thus commits a sin of presumption.39 In the sense that Dante's journey is also a journey into the self, St. Gregory can help us comprehend the symbolic significance of the convert's confusion in a different fashion: "Neque enim mentis oculum potest in id quod intra se raptim conspexerit figere, quia ipso vetustatis suae usu deorsum ire compellitur. Inter haec anhelat, aestuat, super se ire conatur, sed ad familiares tenebras suas victa fatigatione relabitur."40 The soul must make itself pure and spotless 14</page><page sequence="15">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL before it can lay itself bare to the rays of divine light. Only in Purgatorio xxvn, 133, when the Wayfarer is cured of the effects of sin does the sun's light shine directly on his face as Virgil "crowns and mitres him" directing: "Vedi lo sol che'n fronte ti riluce." We may now turn our attention to another of Dante's reactions on the perilous desert shore: his fear is somewhat quieted (v. 19). This fear, timor servilis, as the best critics agree, is a passion, and as such it can impede bodily progress.41 St. Thomas particularly may be cited on this point.42 Dante's choice of words, however, seems more directly inspired by St. Augustine's definition of fear as a "flight of the mind," "timor animi fuga est"; Dante's verse, "cosi l'animo mio, ch'ancor fuggiva" (v. 25) accurately reflects the Saint's metaphor.43 The journey here in the prologue scene is more than a bodily one. Dante's progress is also that of the mind and spirit; corporeal passions point to spiritual fears (fugis animo cum me- tuis).44 1 believe therefore that Dante's paura must figure more than a passion. Surely if it were unfitting to a converted soul, the Poet, having glimpsed the face of God, would not still experience it: "nel pensier rinova la paura" {Inf. I, 6). Theologically, fear is also a virtue, and a gift of the Holy Spirit. Far from hindering spiritual progress, it is a state of the soul most conducive to the reception of the light of truth. In the Judeo-Christian tradition fear is the begin- ning of wisdom (Ecclus. 1:16) and it comes first as a cowardly dread of evil and hell but leads, according to St. Augustine, to charity; though the sinner does not at first actively desire the good, his dread and avoidance of evil set him on a path toward righteousness: "Sunt homines qui propterea timent Deum, ne mittantur in gehennam, ne forte ardeant cum diabolo in igne aeterno. Ipse est timor Me qui introducit charitatem: sed sic venit ut exeat. Si enim adhuc propter poenas times Deum, nondum amas quern sic times. Non bona desideras, sed mala caves. Sed ex eo quod mala caves, corrigis te, et incipis bona desiderare."45 1 submit that Dante fails not because he is hindered by dread but because the salubrious fear he experienced during the night before the beginning of the action of the poem ("la notte che passai con tanta pieta"), has subsided. In the same context Dante's word pieta must also command our attention. St. Augustine divides the progress of the spirit towards wisdom into seven steps: fear, piety (pietas), knowledge, fortitude, counsel, purity of heart, 15</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 and wisdom itself.46 We must come to see that in his progress toward conversion Dante achieves more than desire for the light of truth: he experienced fear and, briefly, before the poem opened, had attained pietas. The disappearance of this pieta, the second step beyond fear, clearly reveals the extent of his backsliding. Fear, the first step in the Christian itinerarium mentis, cannot therefore hin- der the Wayfarer in the way that it has been made out to do. Timor servilis, the selfish fear of the punishments of Hell, is also a condi- tion of compunction ("la paura che mi avea il cor compunto") which leads to chaste fear, timor filialis, to true fear of the Lord.47 That this gift from the Holy Spirit is withdrawn from Dante is a most dangerous sign.48 Lack of fear, not fear itself, therefore, impedes Dante's way to the truth. Timor, the first step on the road to contrition and wisdom, marks a step from which the Wayfarer retreats. Instead of preparing himself for temptation, he forgets his fear and rests,49 disobeying biblical injunction and such warnings as St. Gregory's: Conversio videlicet securitatem parit, mater autem negligentiae solet esse securitas. Ne ergo securitas negligentiam generet, scriptum est: "Fili, ac- cedens ad servitutem Dei, sta in justitia et timore, et praepara animam tuam ad tentationem" (Ecclus. II: 1). Non enim ait, ad requiem, sed ad tentationem, quia hostis noster adhuc in hac vita nos positos, quanto magis nos sibi rebellare conspicit, tanto amplius expugnare contendit.50 The valley had inspired the Wayfarer with fear and compunction, but, when we meet him at the start of the poem, he no longer feels these wounds of spiritual discipline in their necessary and essential fulness.51 All of Dante's reactions are wrong. He glances to the mountain, his fear abates, he looks back,52 rests, fails in his con- frontation with the beasts, and ruins down. Dante commits the sin of pride most particularly in its aspect of presumption which St. Thomas defines as "an inordinate conversion to God": "As to hope whereby a man relies on his own power, there is presumption if he tends to good as though it were possible to him, whereas it surpasses his powers, according to Judith 6:15: Thou humblest them that presume of themselves.' "53 Dante, by attempt- ing a sursum cordis beyond his own power, commits a sin against the Holy Spirit; fear could have aided him for as St. Thomas 16</page><page sequence="17">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL explains: "Inducement of fear suffices to exclude presumption."54 Fear is a corrective of pride in Christian theology, in St. Gregory's words, "Contra superbiam det [Sanctus Spiritus] timorem."55 Though Dante's fear returns temporarily with the appearance of the lion, it does not regain its fulness, by theological definition, as a cowering dread of Hell until after the coming of Virgil, the first messenger in the descent of grace.56 The Wayfarer figures homo claudus bearing the wound inflicted by the sin of Adam, but he is also the man, Dante Alighieri of 1300 who commits a sin of his own volition, the Florentine who aban- doned the vita nuova of conversion to follow the pride of philos- ophers and whose truancy is reflected in every one of his actions in Inferno I, verses 1-61. Schematically we can list the negative signs leading to the fall at the end of the first sixty-one verses of the poem as follows: (1) v. 16, the glance to the hill (2) vv. 19-21, his pieta is past; his fear is quieted (3) v. 24, the backward glance in a simile (4) v. 26, the Wayfarer's backward glance (5) v. 28, he rests (6) vv. 29-30, he continues a journey beyond his powers (7) v. 31, he meets the first of three animals, three dispositions to sin: Lonza (fraud); Wayfarer turns many times to go back. (8) v. 45, Leone (violence) (9) v. 49, Lupa (incontinence); she drives the Wayfarer back to where "the sun is silent" (10) v. 61, he ruins to the depths. The same foot, as we saw in St. Bernard, can deteriorate from a mere pie fermo, lazy and infirm, to a foot of pride, pes superbiae. The sluggish member which prevents ascent to the truth can also cause a fall to the abyss; what at first merely hinders, causes ruin. Only with Beatrice's arrival in Purgatorio xxx and with her ex- planation of the reason for Dante's descent (vv. 136-145), can we understand the true significance of all that has gone before and look to those early lines and see a providence taking shape. Now the "rovinare in basso loco," though it results from a fault of the sinner, 17</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 can be viewed also as a personal lesson sent by God in preparation for gratia gratis data- the inexplicable generosity of the Deity self- moved bestowed upon the sinner. In retrospect we can see that all the events which led to the Wayfarer's temporary failure have an ultimately beneficial effect. Dante ruins down to the depth but with the very next line his success begins. Virgil appears, the last link in a chain of grace which, with the other guides, will lead eventually to the highest heaven. We will not be surprised that this ultimate benefit of the Wayfarer's initial failure is fully anticipated in Church dogma. St. Augustine gives us a clear explanation that the fall to the depths is a lesson and a cure: "Quis enim exaltationem ruinam putat, cum iam ibi sit defectus quo est relictus Excelsus . . . . Et audeo dicere superbis esse utile cadere in aliquod apertum mani- festumque peccatum unde sibi displiceant qui iam sibi placendo ceciderant."57 It is fitting that the newly converted be tried and proven by temptation; evil is a corrective lesson on the path of this life. Hugh of St. Victor, a writer so influential upon Dante, repeats this traditional conception: "Mundus est locus errantium et rep- erandorum; et ideo simul bonum et malum in eo ordinatum est, ut per bonum quidem consolationem accipiant; per malum vero cor- rectionem."58 God leaves man completely to himself in order that he may both experience his own ignorance and realize that he is in need of counsel and aid.59 Dante's personal failure therefore does not in any way alter the eventual fortunate outcome of this first journey; the Wayfarer fails without God's grace but yet that failure is part of God's mysterious providence. Though Satan sends temptation, he does so with God's permission.60 Evil is not a negative opposite to God but an essential part of His plan. In retrospect we understand that the Wayfarer had to fail in order to succeed. In this way we must understand the words of verse 8: "il ben che vi trovai." The eventual miraculous outcome of such a fall is a puzzle whose depths had excited the wonder of St. Gregory: "Ecce qui de virtute se extollit per vitium ad humilitatem redit. Qui vero acceptis virtutibus extollitur, non gladio, sed ut ita dixerim, medicamento vulneratur. Quid est enim virtus, nisi medicamentum? et quid est vitium, nisi vulnus?"61 Thus, in the mystery of Christianity where ascent in pride is descent to sin and descent to humility is ascent to the Divine, the image of pride turns about upon itself. Pride, though 18</page><page sequence="19">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL the volition and commission of the sinner, is also mystically the correcting will of God. University of Illinois Urbana, Illinois NOTES 1.

John Freccero (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 102-121. 1 wish to acknowledge my profound debt to the studies and commentaries of Dr. Singleton. All citations to Dante's Poems are to La Commedia secondo Vantica vulgata, a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, 4 vols., Societa Dantesca Italiana (Milano: Mondadori, 1966-1967). For the rich classical and modern tradition of limping protagonists which is outside the scope of the present study, I recommend to the reader Peter L. Hays' most interesting and erudite article, The Limping Hero: Grotesques in Literature (New York: New York University Press, 1971). On p. 32, n. 36, I read the following footnote, whose transcription surely deserves attention here: "At a still further remove, we have the strange fact that Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrated every spring to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt (or as Christian apologists would have it, redemption of the Israelites from bondage, prefiguring Christ's redemption of mankind), is called Pesach in Hebrew and pesach is cognate with the root verb that means lame or limping." Hays cites Theodor Herzl Gaster, Passover: Its History and Traditions (New York: H. Schuman, 1949), pp. 23-25. 2. "Dante's Firm Foot and the Journey Without a Guide," in Harvard Theological Review, LII (1959), 245-281. A most decisive statement concerning the Christian's condition (and one fully corroborating Freccero's thesis) is found in St. Bernard's Sermo LXXX Super Cantica Canticorum (ed. J. Leclerq et al. in S. Bernardi Opera [Rome: Editiones Cistercienses, 1958 ] II, 279) with its extraordinarily moving description of homo viator as a limping, alienated son: Itaque per magnitudinem, quam retentat etiam perdita rectitudine, IN IMAGINE PER- TRANSIT HOMO, uno quasi claudicans pede et factus filius alienus. De talibus enim reor dictum: FILII ALIENI MENTITI SUNT MIHI, FILII ALIENI INVETERATI SUNT, ET CLAUDICAVERUNT A SEMITIS SUIS [Ps. XVII: 46]. Pulchre appellati sunt FILII ALIENI, nam FILII propter retentam magnitudinem, ALIENI propter amissam rectitudinem. Nee dixisset CLAUDICAVERUNT, sed corruerunt aut quippiam simile, si ex toto homines imag- inem exuissent. Nunc vero secundum magnitudinem quidem IN IMAGINE PERTRANSIT HOMO; quantum vero ad rectitudinem, veluti claudicans, conturbatur et deturbatur ab imagine .... Cur ignorat, nisi quia inclinans se ad haec infima et terrena, thesaurizat sibi terram? Nancy H. Rosenberg noticed the image of homo claudus in Petrarch's Secretum ("Petrarch's Limping: The Foot Unequal to the Eye," in Modern Language Notes, LXXVII [1962], 99-105); the case, however, is not an isolated one in the poet's works. For a lover of the works of St. Augustine the image was a matrix of thought; Petrarch uses the image many times in the Canzoniere, for example: et fuggo anchor cosi debile et zoppo da l'un de' lati, ove'l desio m'a storto (LXXXVIII, 5-6) 19</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, xciv, 1976 che zoppo n'esco, e 'ntra'vi a si gran corso (CCXIV, 24) e'ncomincio: Madonna, il manco piede giovenetto pos'io nel costui regno (CCCLX, 9-10) (Francesco Petrarca, Canzoniere, a cura di Gianfranco Contini [Torino: Einaudi, 1964]). The metaphor also appears for example in Pico della Mirandola's Oration on the Dignity of Man (The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, ed. Ernst Cassirer, et al. [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948], p. 229): "Surely the foot of the soul is that most contemptible part by which the soul rests on matter as on the soil of the earth, I mean the nourishing and feeding power, the tinder of lust, and the teacher of pleasurable weakness." 3.

John Freccero's "Casella's Song (Purg. II, 112)" in Dante Studies, XCI (1973), 73-80, reveals a Dante exclusively devoted to philosophy. 7. St. Augustine contrasts the pride of the Platonists to the humility of the Christianity throughout the Confessions (St. Augustine's Confessions, ed. William Watts, Loeb Classical Library [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press; London: William Heinemann, 1946]), esp. VII, 20, 26; the theme appears in many of his works: De Or dine, II, 5, 16; 9, 27; De beata vita, I, 3; De civitate Dei, X, 29. Of the Stoics the Bishop of Hippo wrote: "Such is the stupid pride of these men who suppose that the supreme good is to be found in this life, and that they can be agents of their own happiness . . . ." He continues his tirade naming Cato, the Peripatetics and the Old Academics (De civitate Dei, XIX, 4; The City of God Against the Pagans, trans.

Cf. St. Thomas, Summa Theologica II-II, Qu. 21, art. 1-4; Qu. 163, art. 2; in Paradiso XXVI, 15-17, Dante has Adam say: Non il gustar del legno fu per se la cagion di tanto assilio ma solamente il trapassar del segno. 9.

Hrabanus Maurus (PL, 112, col 1025) glosses the word pedes: "Per pedes, illi sancti, qui in patria coelesti sunt, ut in Psalmis: 'Statuisti in loco spatioso pedes meos' quod in latitudine 20</page><page sequence="21">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K. CASSELL gratiae sunt qui hinc exeuntes in coelesti patria consistent." 12. Enarratio II in Psalmum XXX: PL, 36, col. 230. 13. In this verse Dante, of course, is echoing Virgil's own usage as our memories or a glance at the notes of any good commentary remind us. In Inf. XXX, 13-14, and Purg. XII, 61-63, Dante again uses "Troia" and "Ilion" as an example of pride brought low. In the first case he uses "altezza" to mean pride and in the second he places the city significantly in the lines immediately following the completion of the anaphora "UOM" symbolizing the sinful pride of man and its consequences. 14. Servius, in his Commentarius in Virgilii Aeneidos, Lib. II, v. 649, tells us that Anchises was lamed [captus membris] through pride: "Cum inter aequales exultaret Anchises, gloriatus traditur de concubitu Veneris; quod cum Iovi Venus questa esset, emueruit, ut in Anchisem f ulmina mitterentur; sed Venus eum cum f ulmine posse vidisset interimi, miserata iuvenem in aliam partem detorsit, Anchises tamen afflatus igne coelesti semper debilis vixit." 15.

In connection with St. Bernard's use of "fessus" and "piger," acedia or sloth was often depicted as affecting the foot (Morton W. Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins [East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1967], pp. 177, 433); similarly, lust or luxuria is a wound of the foot (p. 149). 18.

In spite of the close narrative parallels to the prologue scene, an important difference remains between this passage and Inferno 1, 1-61: St. Bernard describes a successful ascent in humility with the aid of grace; Dante fails. The journey up Purgatory reflects St. Bernard's climb. 19. Enarratio in Psalmum XXXV; PL, 36, col. 353-354. 20. St. Augustine, De civ. Dei, XIV, 13; The City of God, Vol. IV, pp. 334-335. 21. Dante makes the sun the image of God in the Convivio, III, xii, 6-7. See the Classical and Christian references in Freccero's "Firm Foot," p. 246, n. 3. Bevenuto da Imola (Com- entum super Dantis Aldighierij Comoediam, [a cura di] J. F. Lacaita [Firenze: Barbera, 1887], Vol. I, p. 30) reads the image as the Sun of Justice; see also Charles S. Singleton, "Commen- tary" to the Inferno, Bollingen Series, LXXX (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1970), p. 7. H. F. Dunbar, Symbolism in Medieval Thought (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1929), esp. pp. 105 et passim. 22. For example, see Giuseppe Ungaretti, "II Canto I dell1 Inferno," in Letture dantesche, a cura di Giovanni Getto (Firenze: Sansoni, 1962), p. 10. Compare Freccero, "Firm Foot," p. 269, "Once the pilgrim beholds the rays of the sun .... he is healed, so to speak, in one foot." It is hard to see this in the context of the whole Commedia, since only the grace of God can heal the wound of ignorance; Dante is without any form of grace until Virgil arrives. Nancy H. Rosenberg follows Freccero in her article, "Petrarch's Limping," pp. 101-102: "If intellect or appetite (will) is weak, the man limps, and should both powers be uncontrolled, the man is in the moral situation of Dante's pilgrim in the selva oscura before he raises his eyes to the sun thereby converting mind, if not will, to the right goal." 23.

In his Moralium in Job, St. Gregory too had more serious ideas about metaphorical mountains: "Again by a mountain is designated the apostate angel" [PL, 76, col. 669). "The heights of mountains are the loftiness of the proud" {PL, 76, col. 586). Bernardus Silvestris identifies "mountains" in the Aeneid VI, 182, as follows: "Per montes enim aliquando accipiuntur vitia elationis sicut ibi 'montes sicut cera fluxerunt,' aliquando rationabiles et divinae substantiae ut ibi 'montes in circuitu Hierusalem' et ibi 'mons ele- vabitur super omnes montes.' " (Commentum Bernardi Silvestris super sex libros Eneidos, ed. Wilhelm Riedel [Greifswald: J. Abel, 1924], p. 63). 28. Filippo Villani (Comento, p. 105): "Et vidi le sue spall e: Hinc in sacris licteris scribitur: 'Et vidi posteriora videntis me.' Non possunt homines viatores videre Deum in via, nisi in facie ad faciem, sicuti est." Compare, however, Freccero ("Firm Foot," p.275): "According to our reading ... the glance at the light and the subsequent escape from the forest represent a conversion from ignorance and sin. One of the classic wounds was thereby overcome, and there remained the other traditional affliction to which man in this life is subject, the wound of the affectus." There is no basis for thus separating the cure of the two wounds; man alone cannot cure his own ignorance as those in Limbo testify. It is my opinion that Dante must make his journey precisely to cure his ignorantia viae Domini. If it were cured in the Prologue Scene, the corto andar would have been successful. Freccero's position changes in his "Prologue Scene," p. 18, where he sees Dante's journey in Inferno I as parallel to Ulysses' and compares the colle to the ntountain at the beginning of St. Augustine's De beata vita. 29.

Presumption consists in an inordinate conversion to God, according to St. Thomas (Summa Theologica, II-II, Qu. 21, art. 1), and implies immoderate hope: "As to hope whereby a man relies on his own power, there is presumption if he tends to good as though it were 22</page><page sequence="23">Failure, Pride and Conversion in Inferno / . . . , ANTHONY K.

Compare Freccero, "Firm Foot," p. 265: "The traveler's problem, then, is that his body will not respond to his mind, for his fear has been only somewhat allayed." It is not only fear but original sin which causes this lack of response between body and soul. 45. Augustine, In Epistolam Johannis ad Parthos, IX, 5; PL, 35, col. 2049; italics added.

For the knowledge of a good hope thrusts a man not into boasting but into lamentation." (On Christian Doctrine, trans. D. W. Robertson, Jr., Library of Liberal Arts [New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1958], p. 39). See fetienne Gilson, The Christian Philosophy of Saint Augustine, trans. L. E. M.

St. Thomas deals with timor servilis and timor filialis in "De dono timoris," S. Th., II-II, Qu. 19, arts. 1-12. 48. The Sun of Justice will only shine on those that fear: "Et orietur vobis tementibus nomen meum sol justitiae." (Malachias 4:2). That Dante's fear is somewhat allayed marks a step towards presumption; cf. St. Thomas, S. Th., II-II, Qu. 21, art. 3: "Presumption appears to be manifestly opposed to fear, especially servile fear, which looks at the punishment arising from God's justice, the remission of which presumption hopes for." 49. Charles Singleton deals with the concept of rest in the Comedy in Dante Studies 1: Elements of Structure (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1957), pp. 19-25. In the Prologue Scene the Wayfarer's pause violates the biblical injunction: "Let us walk while we have the light, lest darkness come upon us" (John 12:35). St. Bernard comments on the line: "Ergo non ambulantem, sed sedentem a mortis tenebris comprehendi periculum est." {Sermo 49, cap. 7; Super Cantica Canticorum, Opera II, p. 77). 50.

To rehearse all the biblical and classical warnings against backward glances is unnecessary here; let Dante's own comments suffice: Purg. IX, 131-132; X, 5-6, 121-123; XI, 13-15. 53. S.

Singleton has noted that Virgil is confined to a pagan perspective in his recognition of Beatrice ("Lady Philosophy or Wisdom," in Dante Studies 2, pp. 122-138). Here too, I believe, Virgil fails to see that, in the Christian scheme, Dante's fear of Hell is in some way right. Note that Beatrice's later words {Inf. II, 63), "e impedito si nel cammin, che volt'e per paura," make the impediment (of the beasts) result in fear, not result from it. See also V.
