<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY documented examination of an issue of great relevance to the study of modem human origins. It clearly and concisely demonstrates that before we can attempt to identify evidence of prehistoric hominid behavior in the spatial distribution of materials on archaeological sites, we must be aware of alternative processes capable of producing such patterning. The work provides much food for thought. However, readers expecting to learn about modem human origins may find the book's title somewhat deceptive. While Gargett ties the inspiration of the work to the issue of premodem human cognitive abilities, the text deals almost exclusively with nonho- minid site formation processes. Based on Gargett's find- ings, it must be questioned whether or not the spatial patterning of archaeological materials is a useful criteri- on in the search for evidence of modern human cogni- tive abilities. By the end of the book, one is left with the impression that the search for spatial patterning at archaeological sites from any stage of human evolution is pretty much an exercise in futility. Still, this is an important and well-written treatise on the topic of spa- tial taphonomy and should be required reading for any- one dealing with archaeological materials from caves or rockshelters. The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science. STEVEN MITHEN. 1996. Thames and Hudson, New York. 288 pp., 70 figures, bibliography, index. $40.00 (cloth). Reviewed by LeRoy McDermott, Central Missouri State University, Warrensburg. Steven Mithen's impressive interdisciplinary effort to synthesize a general evolutionary model of how human cognitive abilities emerged in their modern form makes for rewarding and, at times, intellectually exciting read- ing. All readers interested in newer approaches to human origins such as "cognitive archaeology" and "evolution- ary psychology" will enjoy perusing his well-written arguments, concise illustrations, and extensive biblio- graphic notes. The excitement generated by his subject matter-nothing less than those properties of the human mind responsible for our success through the millen- nia-and by the elegance with which his hypothesis interlocks with the archaeological evidence is dimin- ished somewhat when basic questions about the accura- cy of such a grand vision are asked. Mithen begins with the current idea that the human mind is a "domain-specific" assemblage of independent "content-rich" cognitive "modules," "faculties," or "intelligences," specialized to handle specific tasks, rather than the all-purpose general problem solver previ- ously assumed. To this model of the mind as a Swiss army knife, where separate specialized blades are the vestigial remnants of earlier biological evolution, Mithen adds four hard-wired cognitive domains or intel- ligences extracted from developmental psychology. These include an intuitive psychology or a social intelli- gence, an intuitive biological or natural history intelli- gence, a module devoted to technical intelligence, and a ubiquitous linguistic intelligence. He next invokes the biogenetic principle that "ontogeny recapitulates phy- logeny" to link the mental growth of the individual with a panoramic reconstruction of the evolution of the human mind in three broad phases. In the first phase, he envisions the mind of our ances- tral "missing link" as equivalent to that of chim- panzees-an undifferentiated general purpose intelli- gence. In spite of the manipulation of symbols by some "clever chimps," he detects no humanlike language fac- ulty. General intelligence also can explain toolmaking and foraging behaviors, and thus neither specialized technical nor natural history modules yet exist. Complex social behavior, however, does argue for a distinctively protohuman social intelligence module. For Mithen, general problem-solving intelligence con- tinues to dominate the Australopithecine mind as well as that of Homo habilis. Even Omo and Oldowan tools, which lack intentional form and whose fabrication is inseparable from their utilization, fail to prove the evolu- tionary differentiation of technical and natural history domains. The recognition of Broca's area and other neur- al prerequisites for language in the endocasts of fossilized skulls likewise fails to convince Mithen that language has progressed beyond the social communication of "loud- mouth" agonistic and sexual displays and the "oohs, aahs, and ouches" of physical grooming. He does see increased brain size as related to group size and continued robust development in a social intelligence module. In the second phase of the prehistory of the mind, which includes Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalen- sis and extends to the appearance of cognitively modern Homo sapiens sapiens, Mithen sees general problem solving steadily supplanted by his four autonomous "specialized intelligences." The imposition of symmetry in hand axes, sometimes simultaneously in three dimen- sions, now argues for a truly human technical domain. The final emergence of a dedicated natural history intel- ligence is found in the successful exploitation of those diverse animal and plant communities necessary for the spread of Homo erectus outside Africa and for Neanderthals to survive in glacial Europe. The lack of intercommunication between these emergent domains explains certain "puzzles" in the archaeological record. Why, Mithen asks, in the midst of such adaptive success did early humans ignore bone, 760 [Vol. 62, No. 4, 1997]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES antler, and ivory as raw materials, and why did they fail to develop special purpose or multicomponent tools? Why did their lithic assemblages show so little change across time and space? The answer is that cognitive domains were "walled-off' and Early Humans could not integrate natural history knowledge of animal behavior with technical intelligence. Social knowledge exists sep- arately from tool making, and these activities take place at different physical locations. Similarly, we do not observe beads or other items of personal decoration, or the ritual inclusion of animal parts in burials, because social messages cannot be integrated with technical fab- rication, and both alike are inaccessible to natural histo- ry intelligence. Nor can language serve an integrative function since linguistic intelligence remains embedded in and limited to the social module. Even technical advances like the Levallois method are thought passive- ly and unintentionally transmitted since Mithen's logic dictates that without language Neanderthal had no con- scious awareness of the cognitive processes housed in his technical and natural history intelligences. In Mithen's third phase, driven now by the integra- tive function of language unshackled from its origins in social intelligence, all domains become open to one another, and the full seamless "cognitive fluidity of the modem mind emerges. From this final redesign comes the cultural revolution of the Upper Paleolithic and our modem consciousness with its passion for analogy, metaphor, and other forms of creative imagination. Cognitive processes critical to making art, previously isolated in separate domains, now interact so that tech- nical intelligence can invest animals with human social meaning, and, in a quasi-alchemical transmutation (for Mithen never considers the sensory motor mechanisms involved), representational and symbolic image making, or art, comes into being. Also, ritualized burial practices and anthropomorphic or totemistic imagery prove con- clusively for Mithen that the mind can now violate the boundaries of specialized domains and entertain super- natural ideas necessary for religious beliefs. The plausibility of Mithen's linkup of theory with archaeology makes for heady reading, but how can we investigate its accuracy? One possibility is to check it against other bodies of knowledge about mental func- tions. Comparing Mithen's model with those sensory, motor, and cognitive functions asymmetrically localized in the left and right cerebral hemispheres immediately raises concerns. A known materialist entity, the hemi- spheric localization of language is lumped with mental- ist and perhaps speculative functions. Where are the spe- cialized neurological regions supporting Mithen's other intelligences? Why should the brain employ different evolutionary strategies for similar cognitive domains? Without confirmation from the material brain, we have no certainty that Mithen is definitively describing the basic faculties operating in human cognition. For all its comprehensiveness, Mithen's panoramic view rests on untested assumptions about the organization of the mind and the brain. Before Farming: Hunter-Gatherer Society and Subsistence. DOUGLAS V. CAMPANA, editor. 1995. MASCA Research Papers, Supplement 12. University Museum Publications, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. v + 117 pp., 34 figures, 16 tables, refer- ences. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Ariane M. Burke, University of Manitoba. Editor Douglas Campana accurately describes the con- tributions to this volume as "disparate in subject and approach." The common thread that unites the five chapters in this book is a focus on subsistence systems in pre-agricultural societies. The book explores the important links between these societies and the environ- ments they exploited. A discussion of animal represen- tations in Upper Paleolithic art (Sally Casey) is followed by an analysis of the conditions under which social hunting occurs (Jonathan Driver) and three chapters that explore the changing nature of human-animal (and human-plant) relationships in the period immediately preceding the adoption of a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle in the Near East (Eitan Tchernov) and in Europe (Marek Zvelebil, Peter Bogucki). Casey discusses the visual imagery used to depict animals in Upper Paleolithic artwork from the south- western French caves of Lascaux and Le Gabillou. This methodical study highlights the detailed knowledge of animal behavior that the prehistoric artists appear to have possessed. The potential use of seasonal imagery as a means of understanding the seasonal context within which the artwork was created is considered with rea- sonable caution. Although a fairly extensive body of published work explores the themes taken up by Casey, readers unfamiliar with Upper Paleolithic art will per- haps be surprised at the level of sophisticated observa- tion on the part of the prehistoric artists, which the author makes evident. Driver models the ecological and social conditions under which "social hunting" (multiple predation, whether communal or cooperative) may become a sig- nificant component of human subsistence before the adoption of farming. Regional prey densities, prey dis- persal patterns, hunting technology, and a capacity for social organization are the determining factors for social hunting. The archaeological signature of social hunting includes the presence of artificial or natural facilities for 761</page></plain_text>
