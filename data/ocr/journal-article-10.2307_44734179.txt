The discussion emphasizes observations of researchers toward the safety standards and the extent to which these have influenced or were influenced by evaluations. Issues concerning energy absorbing steering columns, head restraints, side door beams and windshield glazing and bonding are covered in detail. This paper presents the views of the author and not necessarily those of the National Highway Traffic Safety Admini- stration (NHTSA) . EXECUTIVE ORDER 12291, dated February 17, 1981, requires Federal agencies to review major proposed regulations and prepare a Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the potential benefits and costs of the proposed rule. The Executive Order also requires Federal agencies to perform evaluations of their existing regulations (1).* These evaluations seek to determine the actual benefits and costs of the existing rules by assessing subsequent changes in safety and vehicle costs as vehicles meeting the * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. standards enter and operate in the market- place. This paper will discuss in detail the history of evaluations of existing regu- lations. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had developed an evaluation program for existing regulations well before the Executive Order was issued and, in fact, began to evaluate its existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in 1975. The agency's first comprehensive evaluation of a safety standard (Side Door Strength, Standard 214) was published in 1979; seven more have been published to date (May 1984). The vehicle components that have been evaluated so far and the numbers of the safety standards are: 105 Dual master cylinders and front disc brakes (2) 108 Side marker lamps (3) 202 Head restraints (4) 203 Energy absorbing steering assemblies (5) 204 Steering column displacement (5) 214 Side door beams (6) 215 Bumpers (7) 301 Fuel system integrity (8) Evaluations of benefits are currently underway for the following standards: 205 High penetration resistant (HPR) windshields 207 Seat back locks 212 Windshield mounting 213 Child safety seats 222 School bus seating Cost evaluations have been completed for these and numerous other standards and the evaluation of benefits will be initiated on some of those other standards in the future. 4.461 0096-736X/85/9304-0461C02 . 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">4.462 c- J- KAHANE NHTSA1 s evaluations are not carried out in a vacuum. They draw on earlier pub- lications and remarks by safety researchers, especially those papers that are wholly or partially of an "evaluative" nature. Earlier studies and the views of other researchers form a basis for setting evaluation prior- ities, identifying the potential benefits of a safety device, offering hypotheses on why a device works (or doesn't work), and sug- gesting what types of data should be ana- lyzed, by what techniques, and with what sample size or expected results. Moreover, the collective views of the safety community can be at least as influential as the facts stated in the papers. For example, Gloyns1 accident analysis of steering assembly performance showed that wheel canisters performed better than energy absorbing columns in English cars (9). But the in- ference that it conveyed was that energy absorbing columns were not effective. NHTSA evaluations are published to enable the Government, with the aid of public comment, to decide whether a standard should be retained, rescinded or modified. The evaluations point the way for further analyses or development of safety devices. The two objectives of this paper are: (a) to interpret the safety research community's analyses and perceptions of safety standards, and (b) to assess the effect NHTSA 's evaluations have had on subsequent analyses, actions or views. These objectives will be accomplished by reviewing the development of safety standards evalu- ation and by studying important safety standards individually. It is hoped this paper will stimulate dialogue between NHTSA and the rest of the safety community. DEVELOPMENTS IN VEHICLE SAFETY EVALUATION Automotive Crash Injury Research (ACIR) was a principal source of accident data from 1953 through 1969 (10). Police from more than half of the States and several cities were specially trained to collect detailed accident data, including information on occupant contact points, injuries and crash severity. ACIR investigated about 10,000 accidents involving new American cars each year. The founders of ACIR recognized its utility as an evaluation tool. One of ACIR's 5 objectives was to "assess the effectiveness of corrective measures such as design changes in automobiles, restraint of passengers, etc." In fact, ACIR data were used to evaluate the effectiveness of most of the important safety devices of the 1950-67 era: Garrett analyzed lap belts (11) and the improved door locks of 1956 vehicles (12); Campbell, padded instrument panels (13); Lundstrom, energy absorbing steering columns (14); and Fargo, HPR windshields and wind- shield installation methods (15). Usually, a safety engineer and a statistician partici- pated in the studies. As a result, the papers do a good job of identifying the key bioengineering questions associated with a safety device, designing appropriate analyses for those questions, securing adequate sample size and testing for statistical signi- ficance. The authors developed methods to "control" for differences in crash severity, etc., which had tended to confound results in the past. Evaluations of the 1960 's have an upbeat character, perhaps reflecting the confidence of the research community in that decade of the relative absence of an "adversary" relationship between Government and industry. Essentially, if a safety problem had been clearly identified and a fix had been carefully thought out and developed, there was little doubt that the fix would accomplish its intended purpose in highway accidents. This is not to say that studies were "rigged" to produce good results but rather that papers seemed to reflect authors' confidence that they knew they were evaluating a good thing. The ACIR program was discontinued after 1969, having been superseded primarily by Multidisciplinar y Accident Investigation (MDAI) and, to a lesser extent, by efforts to improve State accident data. In MDAI, accidents are investigated in detail by teams of engineers, medical researchers and social scientists, providing higher quality data than ACIR. The newly created NHTSA made funds available for many MDAI teams, reducing the need for ACIR. At the same time, statisticians expressed dissatisfaction with ACIR sample designs and data consistency and a preference for a census of State accident data. The demise of ACIR was, however, a setback for safety evaluations, because the studies based on MDAI or State data were generally less authoritative. Although two of the stated objectives of MDAI were "evaluation of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards" and "evaluation of effec- tiveness of Highway Safety Program Standards" (16), the data were usually not analyzed in a way that permitted effectiveness estimates for standards. Typically, MDAI teams looked at accidents one-by-one and made judgments whether safety devices made a difference in a particular accident, e.g., "Occupant No. 3 of vehicle No. 2 was not wearing available restraints which probably would have reduced the injuries" (16), p. 137. One exception to this pattern involved teams which had specific analytic objectives, a clear experimental design, and were given enough time and money to gather an adequate sample - e.g. States' evaluation of head</page><page sequence="3">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.463 restraints (17), which was one of the earliest studies indicating that a safety device was not accomplishing its purpose in highway accidents as well as had been anticipated. Other good ways to use detailed MDAI data, provided a large and reasonably representative sample is available, are match-comparison (cases as similar as possible, one with the safety device, one without) or the "what if" approach (obtaining a sample of cases without the safety device and estimating what the consequences would have been if the device had been available). Huelke used these methods to evaluate energy-absorbing steering assemblies (18) and seat belts (19). The medical research community seems to have been especially adept at using MDAI data for evaluations, perhaps because they resemble clinical case histories used in other medical studies. Since doctors inevitably see crash victims who are seriously injured but not necessarily those with little or no injury, they are among the first to become aware if a safety device is not performing as well as anticipated. As a general rule, though, the MDAI accident sample was too statistically uncontrolled and too small for general- purpose evaluation of standards. These shortcomings are documented in O'Day's "Statistical Inference from Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation," published in 1974 (20). His report, in a sense, marked the end of the MDAI era. But he also urged that future accident data files be designed for use in evaluations. In the meantime, efforts to upgrade State accident data made them suitable for evaluations. In 1971, Campbell used North Carolina data to evaluate seat belts and energy-absorbing steering columns (21). New York State data were used to analyze both of those standards plus side marker lamps - a crash avoidance device (22). Many other analyses of State data were published in the early-to-mid 1970's. They tended to be heavier on statistical testing than on intuition, as might be expected when thera are large samples of not very detailed date. Statistically significant results (and even some nonsignificant ones) were sometimes considered meaningful even if there was no logical explanation for them and no attempt had been made to corroborate them with other data. For example, seat belt effectiveness estimates based on State data ranging from 21 to 75 percent were published, usually without any discussion of whether the estimate was realistic, considering the types of crashes that actually occur and the types where belts are likely to be effective (23). The analysts of State files, however, made progress in the application of statistical theory to accident data. Koch, Reinfurt and Höchberg at North Carolina pioneered the use of multidimensional contingency table analysis to separate the effects of other variables. Joksch diagnosed that injury rates increase with vehicle age because of accident reporting biases and changes in driving patterns. He used multiple regression to separate this "vehicle age effect" from real benefits due to safety improvements (24). Before the "age effect" had been widely understood, it was thought that the lower injury rate in newer cars was almost entirely due to safety improvements (25). During the early 1970's, "police bi-level" studies enjoyed brief popularity. Here, police supplemented their usual accident report with a short additional form containing a few data elements specifically needed for a statistical analysis of a safety device. Unlike ACIR, the additional form could be completed with little training or extra investigative effort; thus, it could be filled out by every officer and in every applicable crash, assuring a large, repre- sentative sample. Bi-level studies were used by NHTSA to evaluate seat belts in Oregon (26) and Pennsylvania (27), motorcycle helmets in Michigan and Illinois (28), and by McLean to evaluate head restraints in North Carolina (29). These papers closely resemble analyses of ordinary State data. Bi-levels fell out of favor in the mid-1970 's, squeezed out by NHTSA' s plans for a National Accident Sampling System using NHTSA contractors performing detailed investigations (30) and a National Accident Reporting System based directly on improved State data (31). The latter was never implemented. Accident data collected by insurance companies were used by O'Neill to evaluate head restraints (32) and by General Motors for numerous studies. Important evaluation projects accom- panied NHTSA 's two most noteworthy rulemaking initiatives of the 1970's: passive restraints and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121 (Air Brake Systems). These safety devices differed from earlier ones in that there was, from the start, significant controversy about their effectiveness, with strongly polarized views. Also, for the first time, the cost-effectiveness of safety devices became a major issue, as did owner acceptance, especially so because the Nation was beginning to experience economic pro- blems. As a result, evaluation became an activity of critical interest to all parties. When General Motors planned annual sales of 100,000 air bag cars in 1974, NHTSA prepared a detailed evaluation plan which included investigation, by 5 NHTSA contract teams, of every towaway accident involving an air bag equipped vehicle plus a control group of crashes involving similar cars without air bags (33). When only 10,000 air bag cars</page><page sequence="4">4.464 C. J. KAHANE were purchased, over a 3-year period, the "control group" became the primary sample: NHTSA and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association jointly planned and funded the Restraint Systems Evaluation Project (RSEP) to assess manual seat belts' effectiveness and operational characteristics (23). The teams adhered strictly to a statistical accident sampling plan. Because investi- gations were limited to those data elements needed for the planned analyses, costs were reasonable. Enough accidents were investi- gated to allow the use of sophisticated analysis procedures with statistically significant and defensible results (34). The RSEP enjoyed a high degree of cooperation between statisticians, engineers, and medical researchers and between Government and industry. It paved the way for the sampling, investigation and analysis techniques of the National Crash Severity Study and National Accident Sampling System, NHTSA's principal in-house sources of accident data for developing and evaluating safety standards. The passive restraint rulemaking also stimulated researchers outside NHTSA to develop effectiveness evaluation techniques. Recent advances in biomechanics had made it conceivable to estimate the probability of injuries of a given severity, using dummies in staged crashes. Minicars (33) and Ford (36) developed models whereby the overall effectiveness of a safety device is estimated from biomechanical data. Injury risk is calculated as a function of crash mode, speed and safety equipment, based on staged crashes; then overall injury risk is calcu- lated for a safety device by taking the weighted average over all crash modes and speeds, with the weighting based on distri- butions in existing accident data. Early versions of the simulation models tended to overestimate the effectiveness of safety devices because the lab tests did not adequately simulate highway accident phenomena that decrease effectiveness (ejection, intrusion, etc.) and also because the unrestrained injury rates in the models are based directly on accident data, not on actual tests with unrestrained dummies, so they are not comparable to the restrained test results. The controversy over the cost of passive restraints also stimulated numerous cost analyses based on "teardown ," i.e., the disassembly and individual analysis of components. NHTSA funded the Highway Safety Research Institute to conduct a major evaluation of the air brake standard (37). It was the first study of a crash avoidance standard in which effectiveness was measured directly by gathering large quantities of accident and mileage data and computing accident rates per million miles. It was nearly impossible, however, to establish a causal relationship between the changes in accident rates and the potential effects of Standard 121, because there were so many other factors affecting truck accident rates at that time. The study showed that crash avoidance standards are not easily evaluated by analyzing aggregate, exposure-based accident rates. It is better to identify a narrow group of accidents that should be affected by the standard and compare it to a control group of unaffected accidents involving the same vehicles over the same time period (2, 3). During 1972-75, there were a number of attempts to comprehensively evaluate the existing standards or to summarize published evaluations of the various standards. It is interesting to review the attitudes expressed in these studies. Anderson analyzed the crashworthiness standards in 1972, under contract to NHTSA, using ACIR data for the prestandard cars and MDAI for poststandard (38). Because of differences in the sampling procedures of ACIR and MDAI, the study found zero or negative effectiveness for the majority of the standards and concluded that the net effect of the safety standards was "minimal." The study provided engineering or biomechanical opinions for why standards were ineffective. This was an extreme example of an MDAI study which showed that the standards did not work as anticipated. Joksch analyzed State data in 1973, under contract to NHTSA, to evaluate both the crash avoidance and crashworthiness standards (24). He found all of the major standards to be effective and offered evidence that his findings were consistent with earlier studies. Griffin reviewed published statistical analyses of crashworthiness standards in 1973 and concluded, like Joksch, that all the major ones were effective (39). His study was not funded by NHTSA or the industry. Moreover, Griffin generally accepted the conclusions of the more favorable studies (e.g., that lap belts are effective in nonejection crashes) while disputing the less favorable ones, such as Anderson's. McLean analyzed North Carolina data in 1974, under contract to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (29). He evaluated 4 major crashworthiness stan- dards and found all of them to be effective, at least in certain situations. His paper emphasizes the situations where benefits were found, not the others. Moreover, he found the latest safety devices (ball or mandrel energy absorbing steering columns, integral head restraints) to be more effective than earlier versions (mesh columns, adjustable head restraints). The General Accounting Office evaluated the aggregate effectiveness of the crashworthiness standards in 1976, based on overall injury rates in State data (25). They found a 27 percent reduction in fatalities and serious injuries between model years 1965 and 1969 but little or no further improvement</page><page sequence="5">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.465 from 1969 to 1973. As mentioned earlier, though, the effectiveness for 1965-69 is almost surely exaggerated and that for 1969-73 possibly understated because "vehicle age effects" on injury rates have been attributed to safety devices. The Fourth International Congress on Automotive Safety (San Francisco, 1975) placed "effects of safety standards" and "measurement and quantification of effects" first and second on the agenda. The majority of papers discussed the need for evaluation, defined cost effectiveness criteria, pre- sented evaluation methods or analyzed specific standards. The paper presented by Huelke and O'Day epitomized the views of conference participants (40). They reviewed published analyses of the first 16 crash- worthiness standards (including passive restraints but excluding manual belts), comparing the results with their own views. They concluded that only one of the standards was definitely "effective" (HPR windshields); four were "partially effective" but clearly had major flaws or failed to achieve expec- tations ;and 11 had not yet been successfully evaluated because there were "insufficient" or "conflicting" data. Finally they made a strong case for establishing a formal committee, composed of professionals inside and outside NHTSA, charged with reviewing and evaluating existing standards. The rule- making process should be formally modified to allow standards to be changed, upgraded or rescinded, based on evaluation results. New standards should be accompanied by an evaluation plan. NHTSA should develop accident files suitable for evaluating standards. All of these recommendations were eventually adopted, in some form, by NHTSA. Despite the sentiment in favor of evaluation at the 1975 conference, evaluation activity dwindled during 1976-79, mainly because there were no major new rules to evaluate, there were no new data files to study earlier rules and perhaps, because the controversy associated with passive re- straints and Standard 121 may have diverted attention from the other standards. In late 1979, NHTSA issued its first official evaluation of a safety standard (41) and it has been publishing them regularly since then . These, then, were the principal developments in vehicle safety evaluation during 1953-79. They "bequeathed" the following doctrines, tools and guidelines to researchers, in NHTSA and elsewhere, who are conducting evaluations today: o An understanding that evaluation of existing safety devices is a vital and necessary part of the rulemaking process; that expectations about the potential benefits of a new safety device may not necessarily always be realized in actual use on the highway. o The National Crash Severity Study and National Accident Sampling System: accident data bases which can be subjected to rigorous statistical analyses and whose designers and managers have a commitment to evaluation. o The Fatal Accident Reporting System plus accident files from a number of States, suitable for efficient data processing and statistical analysis. o Developments in biomechanics and laboratory testing that make it possible to estimate effectiveness of countermeasures and their associated standards. o Cost analysis based on "teardown" studies and a framework for assessing cost effectiveness . o An understanding that statistical results based on one data source should be corroborated by another data source and/or a viable explanation based on engineering considerations . o The knowledge, experiences and judgments of the developers and earlier evaluators of the safety standards. DEVELOPMENT OF NHTSA' S EVALUATION PROGRAM Before 1974, there was no office in NHTSA charged with systematically performing comprehensive evaluations of the existing motor vehicle safety standards. The Office of Statistics and Analysis selectively performed statistical or in-depth accident analyses of effectiveness. The Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance tested new vehicles, but not for the purpose of evaluating effectiveness. The Office of Vehicle Safety Research and the Engineering Systems Staff had capabilities in biomechanics and cost estimation, respectively, but rarely applied them to existing safety devices. The Office of Program Evaluation, although strongly committed to the application of management science techniques to the evaluation of Government activities and regulations, was primarily concerned with traffic safety programs at that time. The genesis of NHTSA's evaluation program for vehicle safety standards was the final contract briefing by H. Joksch, in late 1973, on his evaluation of the major crash avoidance and crashwort hiness standards, based on State data (24). The briefing was not viewed as a "final" event, but as a</page><page sequence="6">4*466 C. J. KAHANE starting point. Here was an opportunity to demonstrate the need for a systematic ongoing effort by the agency to evaluate its existing vehicle standards. In 1974, the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation established an agency committee which developed an internal working plan for evaluating the standards (42). They selected the standards that were capable of being evaluated (those which resulted in a significant change in safety equipment in a large number of vehicles). Among those, they assigned evaluation priorities based on the standards' costs and potential benefits, public attitudes, potential negative effects, availability of data, and need for the evaluation results to assist contemplated future rulemaking. Also in 1974, NHTSA issued internal Order 500-1 on the subject of evaluation, which charged the agency's program offices to evaluate the effectiveness of their own existing regulations, with consultation from Research and Development and oversight by the Office of Program Evaluation. In 1975, it was determined that the office responsible for evaluation should be independent from the rulemaking office. The Office of Program Evaluation was assigned the job, and the following standards were identified for evaluation: Standards 208 (passive and manual restraints), 214 (side door beams), 215 (bumpers) and 301 (fuel system integrity). Work began with limited resources in 1976. Contracts were awarded to develop detailed evaluation methods for the four standards mentioned above (43). The contractors found that the effectiveness of manual restraints had already been adequately evaluated (by the RSEP) and passive restraints could not be evaluated until more cars equipped with them were sold. As for the other 3 standards, they recommended a mix of accident analyses, surveys and "teardown" cost analyses which, to a large extent, were subsequently implemented by NHTSA. Also in 1976, the Office of Program Evaluation worked with the National Center for Statistics and Analysis to add to the National Crash Severity Study data elements facilitating the evaluation of head restraints, energy- absorbing steering columns, side door beams and fuel system integrity. The National Center has continued to respond to evaluation data needs since that time. In 1977, the first contract was awarded to perform studies listed in the methodologies: cost analyses of the first set of 4 standards, based on teardown of components (44). Cost analyses have progressed steadily since then and, by 1984, have been completed for most of the standards. Also, in 1977, contracts were awarded to develop evaluation methods for 9 additional standards, including 3 crash avoidance rules. By 1978, the Office of Program Evalu- ation had recruited additional personnel with expertise in statistics and cost estimation and its budget had increased. The office assumed full responsibility for developing and managing contracts and writing the final evaluation document. Later, office staff would perform most of the analyses themselves, relying on contractors only when needed for data collection in the field or laboratory. No further contracts were awarded to develop evaluation methods; they were developed in-house. Three major projects were initiated in 1978, using contractors. The evaluation of bumpers was based on a statistical analysis of insurance data and a large-scale survey of damages not reported to insurance companies. Fuel system integrity was studied using State data on traffic accidents and fires. A contract was awarded to evaluate 8 standards by performing the statistical analyses of State and National Crash Severity Study data called for in the methodologies. In the same year, statistical analyses of the National Crash Severity Study were conducted in-house for the evaluation of side door beams. Another important event of 1978 was Executive Order 12044, "Improving Government Regulations." Although the order primarily dealt with new regulations, it also called for a Government-wide review of existing rules, which were to be tested for sim- plicity, clarity, and effectiveness in achieving legislative goals without imposing "unnecessary" burdens on the economy. The Secretary of Transportation responded by issuing a Departmental Regulations Review List which, in the case of the safety standards, basically incorporated NHTSA's existing plan and timetable. Now, the agency's evaluation program had Executive support . The first comprehensive evaluation document, a preliminary evaluation of Standard 214 (Side Door Strength) was published in 1979 (41). It was based on in-house statistical analyses of a half-completed National Crash Severity Study and a contractor's cost analysis. It expressed benefits in terms of lives saved, serious injuries avoided and Equivalent Fatality Units (EFU) saved; costs were the sum of the purchase price increase (manu- facturing cost plus markups) and lifetime fuel consumption (due to the weight added to a car by the standard). Benefits and costs were calculated for the safety equipment that was actually installed in production vehicles, even if that was done before the standard's effective date, and not for the "theoretical minimum" needed to meet the standard. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in</page><page sequence="7">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.467 terms of cost per EFU saved. The same approach was basically used in all subsequent evaluations. On the other hand, the report had shortcomings which, as mentioned above, were characteristic of some of the earlier evaluations performed by statisticians. It was based on a single data file. Statis- tically significant casualty reductions in that file were presented as facts, essentially without corroboration from other files as an adequate explanation based on engineering considerations, test results or in-depth accident analysis. Also in 1979, the agency published a formal evaluation plan for the passive restraint standard (45). It was prepared after the General Accounting Office and the National Transportation Safety Board had called for such a plan in their reviews of Standard 208 (45) p. 4. A NHTSA task force headed by Office of Program Evaluation staff developed the plan, which was a blueprint for a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of air bags and automatic belts. It was the first agency publication which recognized that, under the existing standard, fewer than half the cars would likely be equipped with air bags (p. 11 of the plan) or that opera- tional problems such as inadvertent deployments (referred to as "malfunctions during normal vehicle operation") were an important study topic. The report set a precedent because thereafter the Office of Program Evaluation has prepared and placed in the docket similar plans for other major rules (Center High Mounted Stop Lamps, 1983). In 1980, a Federal Register Notice invited public comment on the agency's approach and priorities for evaluating the standards (46). A persistent comment was that the agency should review the admin- istrative burden that standards impose on manufacturers and suppliers - testing, record keeping and reporting - with the eventual objective of streamlining the burden when this does not compromise safety. That recommendation was implemented in 1982. Comprehensive evaluations of energy- absorbing steering assemblies (5) and bumpers (7) were published for public comment in 1981. The former, which was the agency's first final (as opposed to preliminary) evaluation, was produced entirely in-house, except for the cost analysis based on teardown. Many shortcomings of the 1979 evaluation of side door beams were corrected. Each of the major statistical results was corroborated by analyzing another data file. Extensive in-depth accident analyses or test data were presented to support or explain statistical findings. Analytic work was preceded by literature review and discussions with experts on the subject, whereby the main analytic issues were identified. An attempt was made to include analyses useful to future efforts to upgrade the columns. The report more or less set the pattern for subsequent evaluations. The bumper study, which showed little or no net benefit to consumers from improved bumpers, was influential in later rulemaking. Also, in 1981, the office awarded its first contract for laboratory testing as an evaluation technique; stopping tests for cars with hydraulic brakes (47). In 1981, the regulatory reform movement gained strength, in large measure because of Executive Order 12291 (1). The order requires agencies to perform evaluations of existing major rules, including any which results in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more ($10-12 per car). This order, unlike its 1978 predecessor, specifi- cally indicates that the evaluation must determine the rule's actual costs and actual benefits and the potential costs and benefits of viable alternatives to the current rule, if any exist. Agency management reviewed all of the existing and proposed safety standards. The burden of proof had shifted: unless specific evidence could be provided that a standard is beneficial, its continued existence was questioned. Evaluations were urgently desired. The subsequent review had relatively little effect on standards that had been in place for some time. A large number of these standards, especially in crash avoidance, essentially codified the existing practices of the U.S. auto industry - e.g., SAE Recom- mended Practices. Such standards were justified because current practices needed to be maintained and because costs were limited to administrative burden. A much smaller list of standards could actually be asso- ciated with significant changes in safety equipment - and they were the ones already being evaluated by the Office of Program Evaluation. A Departmental Priority Review List was added to the Regulations Review List established in 1978. It contained existing major standards and earmarked them for urgent evaluation, spelling out the Executive Order 12291 requirements: first, the agency would publish the evaluation, together with a Federal Register Notice inviting public comment (just as had been done in the past, say, with the steering assembly study). An important new step was added, though: after the comments were received, the Office of Program Evaluation would review them and, based on the evaluation and the comments, prepare a paper describing and comparing various options such as retaining, rescinding or modifying the standard. In 1982, the agency published "Regula- tory Reform - The Review Process," which described the role of evaluations in meeting Executive Order 12291, summarized the studies already published, and gave a detailed</page><page sequence="8">4.468 C. J. KAHANE rationale and timetable for future evalu- ations (48). An important part of this document discussed the need for reviewing the administrative burden imposed by standards. NHTSA's first administrative review dealt with the semi-annual reporting requirements in connection with the fuel economy standards (49). It was submitted to the docket in 1982 and led to rulemaking to reduce the require- ment . The first comprehensive evaluation of the costs and benefits of crash avoidance equipment - dual master cylinders and front disc brakes - was published in 1983 (2). Also in that year, the Office of Program Evaluation awarded its first contract to perform sled tests using anthropomorphic dummies to evaluate a safety device: child safety seats (30). In 1986, Center High Mounted Stop Lamps are scheduled to be implemented on passenger cars. By that time, the Office of Program Evaluation should have completed its evalu- ations of the existing major safety standards and will be ready to evaluate the lamps. REVIEWS OF FOUR PRINCIPAL INJURY REDUCTION DEVICES The preceding sections outlined the development of evaluation chronologically; here, it will be examined standard by standard. The emphasis will be on the positions of the research community toward the standard prior to NHTSA's evaluation; the key issues addressed by the evaluation; an assessment of the extent to which the evaluation changed attitudes or resolved controversies (or created new ones); and the actions or follow-up research that have been initiated or might be contemplated as a result of the evaluation. The review is limited here to standards applying to safety equipment of new passenger cars. Bumpers, fuel economy, child safety seats and air brakes are outside the scope of this report. The evaluative history of the crash avoidance standards can be summed up fairly well in that few attempts were made to evaluate the standard, prior to NHTSA's effort - either the devices' benefits were considered self- evident (e.g., dual master cylinders) or the device could be justified because it enhanced customer satisfaction with the car (disc brakes) or the standard required virtually no change in safety equipment or it was con- sidered impossible to evaluate. The same can be said for the less prominent crash- worthiness standards. Really, then, a more detailed review would only be appropriate for the "big six" injury reduction devices for passenger cars: padding (Standard 201), head restraints (202), improved steering assem- blies (203/204), windshields (205/212), restraints (208) and side door beams (214). Padding and restraints will not be considered here because they have not yet been officially evaluated by the Office of Program Evaluation; moreover, an evaluative history of restraints would require a paper of its own. The four remaining devices will now be reviewed in the order that they were evalu- ated by NHTSA. ENERGY ABSORBING STEERING ASSEMBLY- A great deal of evaluative work has been performed in the steering assembly. Even though statistical studies have rather consistently shown the assemblies effective in reducing casualties, there have been sharp swings in the research community's attitude towards them. Development of an energy-absorbing steering assembly began at the Saginaw Steering Gear Division in 1959. Seven years of pioneering work in biomechanics, labora- tory testing and engineering design, which included the development of a series of prototypes, culminated in the building of a column that performed very well in tests (51). Given this effort to perfect the device, there was every reason to expect success on the highway after it was imple- mented in production vehicles in 1967-68. Early accident analyses based on individual in-depth cases suggested that the new columns were very effective. Huelke wrote in 1968 that "steering column injuries sustained by drivers striking the energy- absorbing column... at most usually consist of a 'sore chest.'" (52). Successful experiences with the new columns in severe crashes were shown side-by-side with fatal accidents involving pre-standard cars. Before long, though, accident investi- gators became aware that columns often failed to compress significantly. Many of the noncompressions involved little or no injury to the driver, but sometimes there were serious injuries. Patrick, as early as 1969, wrote that "an investigation should be conducted to determine why the columns do not collapse in some impacts when the force is obviously above the collapse force as evidenced by gross deformation of the stiff steering wheel" (53). The finding set off a long investigation into what was "wrong" with the columns. Meanwhile, statistical analyses of accident data were rather consistently showing that the new columns had eliminated about 40 percent of serious injuries in- volving contact with the steering assembly - a very substantial reduction but not a cure (14, 21, 22, 29, 54, 55). The interpretation of the results, however, tended to take on a "black or white" character. Either the report says, "injuries were significantly reduced," as if statistical significance indicates total success, when in reality an</page><page sequence="9">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.469 infinitesimal reduction can be significant, given a large enough sample, or the energy- absorbing column was viewed as intrinsically of little value. Three studies prepared in 1972-74 strongly supported the view that the columns were of little value in accidents. Anderson's seriously biased analysis of MDAI and ACIR data showed that energy-absorbing columns (and most of the other safety devices) had zero or adverse effect on injury risk (38). Garrett and Hendricks reviewed in detail the performance of columns in selected MDAI cases - mostly cases where the columns performed poorly (36). They reported that their study confirmed Anderson's result and also cited an aggregate MDAI statistic that 76 percent of the columns in frontally impacted cars had 1 inch or less com- pression - although this statistic is meaningless without knowledge of how many of the crashes involved forces below compression thresholds. Most important, though, Gloyns et al published a study of in-depth accident investigations which showed that energy- absorbing devices in the hub of the steering wheel were much more effective than energy- absorbing devices in the column of English cars (9). The column devices were exceedingly susceptible to binding. The study was widely interpreted to mean that the energy-absorbing column had little or no benefit, even relative to pre-standard columns. These studies were influential. The earlier statistical analyses that found high effectiveness were either downplayed-e.g. , by Huelke and O'Day (40) - or attributed to a theory that the initial designs of energy- absorbing columns were less susceptible to binding than later ones. NHTSA sponsored a study of cars with wheel canister devices sold in the United States, which failed to confirm or refute Gloyns' results (57). Otherwise, though, little action was taken during 1974-79. Thus, the principal issues when NHTSA began the evaluation in late 1979 were: Are the columns effective at all? How often are the columns binding? Is binding due to the column being damaged before the occupant contacts it; vertical rotation of the column; nonhorizontal column alignment; or oblique occupant impact forces? Are wheel canisters significantly more effective, or ball columns significantly less effective than other designs? Another important issue, though not as controversial was: Did Standard 204 reduce "intrusion" of the column into the compart- ment? Did manufacturers change the design of steering wheels in the late 1960 's and did those changes reduce injuries? The evaluation (5), which was based on NCSS, FARS and MDAI data and published in 1981 , clearly showed that the columns are effective, reducing serious steering assembly contact injuries by 38 percent, consistent with the six earlier statistical studies. In fact, they are saving more lives than any of the other safety standards (given current levels of belt usage). Column binding was found to be a serious problem, but not nearly as severe as suggested by Garrett and Hendricks or Gloyns et al. Based on an analysis of compression vs. steering wheel deformation, it was concluded that columns were "binding" about half of the time. The evaluation did not present new information on why the columns were binding, but supported earlier hypotheses. It showed that wheel canisters were not superior to energy- absorbing columns, at least, not in the United States. (There are major differences in American and English column design and installation methods.) Nor were ball columns inferior . Standard 204 was found to reduce rearward "intrusion" of the column by 81 percent, accounting for a substantial proportion of the overall effectiveness. Significant reductions in head and abdominal injury were attributed to improvements in steering wheels made voluntarily by manu- facturers . The evaluation appeared at a time when the research community was reassessing the negative views on steering assemblies and, once again, giving them high priority as a means for reducing injuries. New accident analyses dealing with problem identification (58) and biomechanics research at General Motors contributed to the change in views. The evaluation helped by essentially settling the controversies over whether the columns were effective at all, or relative to wheel canisters. It also helped eliminate Standards 203 and 204 from the list of rules considered for possible rescission during the 1981 reassessment at NHTSA. The evaluation did not settle the controversies about binding of the column. Ironically, even though it showed that columns were doing much better than thought by Garrett or Gloyns, it was criticized for not going far enough (the views of researchers having swung in favor of the column). General Motors pointed out, correctly, that steering wheel deformation without column compression does not necessarily indicate binding (59). NHTSA prepared a follow-up analysis using serious thoracic injury due to steering assembly contact, with less than 1 inch compression, as evidence of binding (60); by this cri- terion, which is likely to understate "binding," 23 percent of the columns did not compress when they should have - still à serious problem.</page><page sequence="10">4.470 c. j. KAHANE The Agency is currently conducting a laboratory test program to explore in detail the factors affecting column compression in response to occupant loading. HEAD RESTRAINTS - A fair number of evaluations of head restraints were performed up to 1974. They had considerable influence on the research community's attitude towards the restraints, which changed from optimism to disappointment. But little evaluation was done between 1975 and 1981, even though there were unsettled controversies. The medical community played an excep- tional role in the development of head restraints. States and others proved that whiplash was a genuine organic injury which apparently was due to hyperextension of the neck in crashes (61). Laboratory testing by Severy, some of it as early as 1956 but mostly during 1965-67, clearly demonstrated that head restraints reduce hyperextension of the neck (62). Mertz and Patrick volunteered themselves to ride the sled and test head restraints (63). The safety community agreed to the existence of the problem and enthusi- astically implemented its seemingly obvious solution by 1969, with many voluntary installations of head restraints in 1967-68. The medical community was also the first to see that head restraints were not a cure: many whiplash patients kept coming to their offices. Once it was obvious that head restraints were not an absolute cure, researchers were eager to conduct statistical evaluations to see if they were effective at all. O'Neill's 1972 analysis of insurance data (32) and States' MDAI study (17) in the next year found a 15-18 percent reduction of neck injuries. Other studies based on smaller samples had similar results. At that time the safety community split into two camps. One believed that the exact mechanism of whiplash was still largely unknown and, in most cases, not mitigated by head restraints (40). The other took note that most of the head restraints in pro- duction vehicles were of the adjustable type and 75 percent of those were left in the "down" position by occupants. They still hoped that benefits would be much greater if cars had integral head restraints or if adjustable ones were to be made higher (32). Unfortunately, at that time, there was no sample of rear impacts involving integral restraints which was large enough for statistically evaluating their effectiveness. The Government clearly belonged to the second camp. In 1974, NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requiring tall integral head restraints for the driver and a tall adjustable or integral restraint for the passenger (64). It also would have required a dynamic compliance test and extended the standard to light trucks and multipurpose vehicles. The manufacturers had made an effort to produce large numbers of cars with integral restraints, especially during 1971-73. By 1974, their effort waned; Chrysler reported that many customers were dissatisfied with integral restraints because they obstructed visibility for short occupants and made rear seat occupants feel boxed in (65). They protested the proposed rulemaking because its safety benefits had not been adequately demonstrated and because the tall seatbacks would create vision obstructions. The proposed rule was never adopted. The time had passed when major changes in safety equipment could be mandated without firm quantitative evidence of potential benefits. As stated above, integral head restraints had not been statistically evaluated. Ironically, though, enough cars with integral restraints had been sold during 1971-73 that a definitive evaluation could have been made by 1975 or 1976. During the 1975-81 period two major controversies remained unresolved; they were: How much more effective are integral restraints? How serious are the vision obstructions caused by tall restraints? The manufacturers installed integral restraints on inexpensive or sporty cars with bucket seats and adjustable restraints on other cars, year after year. The Government did not push its proposed rulemaking. Thus, when NHTSA began to evaluate Standard 202 in 1981 , the two main contro- versies were still unresolved. Three years of Texas data, despite their shortcomings in terms of injury reporting, enabled NHTSA to evaluate head restraints adequately. The evaluation (4), which was published in 1982, showed that integral restraints reduced overall injury risk in rear impact crashes by 17 percent (whiplash by 28 percent); adjustable restraints reduced overall injury risk by 10 percent (whiplash by 17 percent)- the latter result is entirely consistent with O'Neill's and States' findings. Thus, the evaluation settled the first controversy: integral restraints are significantly more effective than adjustable but come nowhere near a "cure" for whiplash. Moreover, the evaluation contained anthro- pometric analyses which suggested that adjustable restraints in the "down" position can be at least partially effective. They may even yield adequate protection for shorter- than-average persons. Conversely, sub- stantial increases in seatback height would provide only modest additional benefits. The evaluation confirmed what most of the research community probably already believed: none of the current designs is the remedy to all whiplash mechanisms. At the same time, the report showed enough benefits to elimi- nate Standard 202 from consideration for rescission.</page><page sequence="11">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.471 The second controversy - vision obstruc- tions due to tall head restraints-was not addressed by the evaluation but, in a sense, it became moot. The study did not show enough potential benefits to encourage an increase in height requirements. The only controversy caused by the evaluation concerned its statement that integral restraints are much less costly than adjustable ones. The controversy was resolved when subsequent analyses by NHTSA showed the statement is true only for bucket seats with a "Spartan" design of integral restraints (67). A question that remains today is the identification of the specific occupant kinematics that cause whiplash injury. SIDE DOOR BEAMS - Unlike energy- absorbing steering columns and head re- straints, little evaluative work was performed on side door beams. Side door beams were developed by Hedeen and Campbell at the Fisher Body Division during the late 1960 fs, following an exten- sive program of research and crash testing (68). Few details of that program were made public. Hedeen only wrote that they initially tried two approaches - raising the sill or strengthening side structures. Raising the sill (which was viewed very favorably in later side impact literature) was effective in reducing intrusion but considered unacceptable to customers. Upgraded structures were also effective; a side door beam with local reinforcements was as good as a massive upgrade. The beam worked because it increased crush resistance, helped a car deflect a striking vehicle or object, and forced a striking vehicle down towards the car's sill. Fisher Body Division developed a static test for measuring side door strength which was adopted by the SAE as Recommended Practice J367 in 1970 and by NHTSA as a proposed consumer information standard in 1968 and as a proposed safety standard (with a strength level that would put side door beams into cars) in 1970. NHTSA published little documentation or analysis supporting the standard; the agency crash tested two cars, one with and the other without the beams, and had found little benefit for the beams in the unrealistic type of test used (69). The proposed standard was criticized as being of unproven effectiveness and involving a test that did not realistically simulate highway crash conditions. Chrysler submitted crash test data which showed beams to have at best a limited effectiveness in reducing intrusion in car to car crashes (70). Nevertheless, the proposal became a final rule; the regulatory climate in 1970 was quite different from 1984. But there was little or no controversy after 1970. In fact, beams were installed in many cars before the 1973 effective date. Four evaluations were published during 1973-77 (24, 29, 71, 72). None of them drew firm conclusions about effectiveness. In general, the sample sizes were too small for significant results or the data were not detailed enough to show that observed injury reductions were, in fact, due to Standard 214. McLean's (29) and Jones' (72) studies at least provide some encouragement that beams might be partially effective in reducing injuries. The beams may have been viewed favorably by manufacturers because customers liked the doors' more solid feel and sound when they were slammed shut. During the mid-to-late 1970 's, exciting new concepts and methods for studying side impacts were featured in the literature: door velocity, side impact dummies, deformable moving barriers, aggressivity , etc. Beams are hardly ever mentioned, except occasionally as to how they would be modified to fit in the upgraded vehicle structure (73). The prin- cipal questions when NHTSA began its preliminary evaluation in 1978 were: Are side door beams effective at all in reducing casualties in side impact crashes? Do they reduce intrusion of the door into the compartment? Do they help deflect a striking vehicle or object, as suggested by GM and others? Do they force a striking vehicle down into the struck car's sill? The preliminary evaluation (41) was based on the first half of the National Crash Severity Study and published in 1979. Statistically significant results on effec- tiveness were presented without much in-depth followup. Only the first two questions listed above were addressed. The most distinctive aspect of the report was its separate analyses of effectiveness in single-vehicle and multivehicle crashes. The motivation for this approach came from some tables extracted from NCSS by Hedlund and Partyka. In the relatively small accident sample studied, serious injuries decreased by a statistically significant 66 percent in the single vehicle crashes and increased by a nonsignificant 20 percent in multivehicle crashes. Door intrusion was 14 percent less common in the post-standard cars. The preliminary eval- uation did not convince the research community that Standard 214 was effective in single vehicle crashes, because of the methodological shortcomings. Another ironic reason was the observed effects themselves. If the effectiveness in single and multi- vehicle crashes had been 30 and 10 percent, say, instead of 66 and -20 (as could easily have happened, given the available sample size) it would have been more "convincing," despite being no more valid. In general,</page><page sequence="12">4.472 C. J. KAHANE reviewers correctly observed that the study did not adequately distinguish the effect of beams from other factors (74). But Hollowell found meaning in the observed trend, if not the actual numbers. He viewed the results as reflecting the tendency of a beam to help a car deflect by a fixed object, whereas a striking vehicle underrides the beam and overrides the sill; the evaluation supported some of the concepts proposed for upgraded side structures (73). NHTSA's final evaluation of side door beams (6), published in 1982, remedied the shortcomings of the 1979 report. It was based on the full NCSS file, FARS and Texas data as well as an extensive literature review. It showed convincingly that beams are effective in side impacts with fixed objects, reducing fatalities by 23 percent, serious injuries by 25 percent . They do not save lives in side impacts by another vehicle, but reduce serious injuries by 8 percent. The life- savings in single vehicle crashes alone, though, places Standard 214 among the most effective existing standards, ranking only behind energy-absorbing columns and seat belts in terms of the number of lives saved. The report clearly showed that Standard 214 was effective in single vehicle crashes by enhancing deflection of fixed objects and protecting the door's integrity (fewer ejections). It caused a modest but signifi- cant reduction of intrusion in vehicle- to-vehicle crashes, reducing torso injuries of persons sitting next to a struck door - partly because it forces some striking vehicles down towards the sill. The evalu- ation resolved the principal questions about side door beams, although it is still not understood exactly why the beams work the way they do in impacts with fixed objects, but have much less effect on damage patterns when a car is struck by another vehicle. The evaluation helped convince the safety community that side door beams, or their equivalent, are needed to protect occupants in side impacts with fixed objects and would continue to be needed for that purpose even after any proposed new side impact protection standard. WINDSHIELD MODIFICATIONS - High Pene- tration Resistant glazing (Standard 205) and adhesive bonding have been lumped together because they both apply to windshields, but they could not have more different evaluative histories. HPR glazing was viewed from the start as a miracle cure; that view was confirmed by every evaluation. The safety community split in its views on the method of bonding; evaluations had contradictory results, supporting both sides; the modi- fication was implemented in domestic cars even though the conflict was never really resolved . The HPR windshield is a low-cost evolutionary but very significant improvement over existing laminated safety glass. It is based on an idea initially explored by Rodio ff - loosening the glass-plastic bond by increasing the moisture content of the plastic. Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Ford, Monsanto and DuPont developed it in this country. Laboratory tests by Patrick (75) and Rieser (76) showed that HPR glass doubled or tripled the velocity at which an occu- pant's head penetrates the plastic inter- layer - penetration being the cause of most serious lacerations and facial fractures. The domestic manufacturers installed it in all cars in 1966 and NHTSA mandated it in 1968. The HPR windshield used the materials (available at that time) that gave the highest possible penetration velocity without dangerous blunt impact force levels. Accident analyses by Huelke (77) and Fargo (15) confirmed that the HPR windshield was just as effective in highway accidents. In 1975, Huelke and O'Day characterized Standard 205 as the only one which was "truly effective." Although in recent years the development of Securiflex glazing has caused researchers to focus on the shortcomings of existing HPR glazing, it is still viewed as a tremendous improvement over earlier windshields. Adhesive bonding of the windshield to the frame was developed at General Motors and applied on an experimental basis in some 1963 cars and as standard equipment on all 1964 intermediates (78). It superseded the looser installation method using a rubber gasket. The literature does not specify whether the primary objective of adhesive bonding was to enhance windshield retention in crashes and reduce the risk of ejection or to save on manufacturing costs. The manufacturers gradually changed over from gaskets to adhesive bonding. By 1979 all domestic cars used adhesive bonding but many imports still had gaskets. Standard 212, which is the safety regulation that is most closely "associated" with the change over from rubber gaskets to adhesive bonding, does not specify how a windshield is to be mounted but just sets a performance requirement: 75 percent of the periphery must be retained in a 30 mph barrier impact. Its objective is to reduce the risk of ejection through the windshield. In many cases, a standard and its "associated" vehicle modification are two different things but rarely more so than here - rubber gaskets could and did meet Standard 212 and were installed on new cars long after the 1970 effective date. In fact, the literature does not state whether the standard accelerated the industry-wide shift to adhesive bonding. This safety modi- fication is also unique in that it appears to</page><page sequence="13">EVALUATIONS OF FMVSS 4.473 have reduced rather than increased cost and weight (79). The safety community split iato two camps on adhesive bonding. Most European researchers and some Americans feared that adhesive bonding, which lacks the "give" and "controlled pop-out" of gaskets, would reduce the windshield's penetration velocity and dissipate much of the reduction in lace- rations and fractures achieved with HPR (80). They thought the potential savings of ejections were negligible. Most Americans, on the other hand, were convinced that the periphery of the windshield had little influence on its response to an impact in the middle, since glazing is a poor medium for transmitting force over a significant distance (81); thus the potential negative side effects were negligible. They also believed ejection through the windshield to be a serious problem. Both camps had well thought-out evaluations to support their viewpoint. Rodloff and Breitenbuerger 's laboratory tests showed in 1967 that adhesive bonding reduced penetration velocity by over 33 percent (80). Fargo' s analysis of ACIR data in 1968 attributed to adhesive bonding an alarming increase in head injuries which wiped out much of the gains for the HPR windshield (13). Patrick, on the other hand, conducted two studies using sled tests with dummies and production windshields from American cars (81, 82). Both showed that the windshield installation method had negligible effect on penetration velocity, dummy injury levels and, for that matter, windshield retention during impacts. The second study (81), published in 1970 and sponsored by Chrysler, seems to have been motivated by Fargo's accident analysis. Apparently, its results reassured domestic manufacturers that adhesive bonding was safe. On this occasion, a well thought-out laboratory study gained more credibility than a well-designed statistical analysis. But European and Japanese manufacturers continued to use rubber gaskets and, apparently, did not change their views (83). Thus, the controversy was never really resolved. The reports only analyzed the effect of installation methods on the injury risk of persons who are not ejected. There do not appear to have been any analyses of whether adhesive bonding achieved its original goal of reducing ejection. Thus, the major issues to be addressed by NHTSA's comprehensive evaluation are: Does adhesive bonding enhance windshield retention or reduce ejection? What is its effect on the injuries of persons who are not ejected? How can the discrepancies of earlier evalu- ations be explained? What is the actual effectiveness of HPR windshields in reducing various specific types of injuries? The evaluation will be based on NCSS, FARS, New York and Texas data and completed in 1984. SUMMARY 1 . The value of evaluating the effectiveness of existing vehicle safety devices has been recognized for a long time. 2. Engineers, medical researchers and statisticians have made distinctive contri- butions to safety evaluations. 3. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has developed a systematic program for evaluating the benefits and costs of its major vehicle safety standards. REFERENCES 1.
