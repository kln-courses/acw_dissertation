Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (VOKS) in Moscow. The Termez expedition conducted excavations in the ancient city of Termez and at Airtam, which is situated I 7 kilometers east of Termez, on the right bank of the Amu Darya. Ancient written sources do not mention Airtam, but since the ruins cover an extensive area and the arti- facts unearthed are of skilled workmanship, this must have been a large settlement. The elevated part of the site, which is 250 by ioo meters, is bounded on three sides by shapeless clay walls. The fourth side is contiguous with the steep bank of the Amu Darya. The ruins of the set- tlement, also enclosed by walls, are directly adja- cent to the elevated part of the site. The excavations were concentrated on the southwestern part of the platform. Several premises, belonging to a single edifice, built of large, unburnt bricks, were unearthed. Those rooms in which a sculptured cornice and frag- ments of reliquaries and of an alabaster statue of Buddha were found during the first excavations on the site undoubtedly served for cult purposes (Figs. I, 2, and 33). The adjacent premises, with several hearths and large clay pots (khumi) for storing food and water, probably served as the sanctuary kitchen. Two floors, dating from different periods, were unearthed in the sanctuary. Parts of the walls, between the two floors, were covered with a fine layer of alabaster, which was entirely different from the rough clay plaster still preserved above the upper floor. Thus, two different periods have been estab- lished for this building, the first of which is dated by a bronze coin of an unnamed ruler with the inscription: "BAIEE BA I EWN EWTHP ME 3 For another view of this particular bust, see Field and Prostov, "Archaeological Investigations.. .," Fig. 4.</page><page sequence="2">144 NOTES A," referring to the first century B.C. Excavations carried on at a still greater depth, beneath the lower floor, brought to light cultural strata attributed to the latest centuries before our era. In these strata thin-walled pot- tery of dark rose clay with a red slip and fired clay tiles, one of which is stamped with a repre- sentation of a deer, were found. Excavations at Airtam also yielded a large number of shards, thick-walled khumi, kettles, jugs, plates, bowls, saucers, and conical lampions. The prevailing type of pottery was covered with a brown, cream, or red slip, for the most part without ornament, often superbly burnished and composed of fine clay. There were also examples of colored varnished pottery. The ornamentation can be divided into five categories: stamped, molded, burnished, painted, and incised. With but few exceptions the vessels were wheel-made. In several sections of Airtam kilns and large heaps of slag indicated extensive local development of pottery manufacture. Many terra-cotta figurines of animals and people, cult objects, statuettes, and architectural fragments of marly limestone (Figs. 4 and 5) were unearthed. One male figure, 22.5 cm. high and in barbarian dress, is shown holding a disk with a palmette in relief (Fig. 4); a Kushan type figure is represented with a vessel in the left hand (Fig. 5). The different periods represented in the cul- tural deposits, the lowest attributed to the last centuries before our era and the upper to the first centuries of our era, reveal that Airtam existed over a long period of time. Excavations were also conducted at several points in the ancient city of Termez. An ancient Buddhist monastery, consisting of many artifi- cial caves and of overground chambers, was found on the Kara Tappa elevation. The upper structures were built of unburnt brick and partly faced with stone. The floor was also of unbaked brick, coated with clay. The walls had a lower coating of clay covered with alabaster, on which traces of varicolored frescoes have been pre- served. The walls of one room possessed a red border. A picture showing the lower part of a human figure is still preserved above the border, and traces of the feet, encased in red footgear, and parts of colored garments may still be dis- cerned. The painting resembles that at Bamian. The caves, dug at different levels in the sand- stone strata of the mounds, are connected by staircases. Caves situated on one level, however, communicate through corridors. The caves con- sist of rectangular chambers of 7 to I2 square meters and are encircled on all sides by passage- ways about 3 meters wide and from I 3 to i6 meters long; the corridors and the caves are I .5 to 2.0 meters high (Figs. 6 and 7). Benches were hewn along the walls of the caves and shallow niches occur in the walls of the caves and corri- dors. Arabic inscriptions were discovered on the walls, which indicate that Arabs visited and pos- sibly used these caves for a considerable time after their conquest of Termez. The excavations brought to light several caves of large dimensions, probably intended for public purposes, as well as small caves for individual use. Coins, pottery, and other finds at Kara Tappa date from the last centuries B.C. to the first centuries A.D. (Fig. 8). The eastern faqade of a suburban palace of the Termez4 rulers of the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Fig. 9) was cleared in order to estab- lish the ground plan. The excavators also un- earthed a water reservoir of 70 meters square and 2 meters deep, constructed in the courtyard of this palace complex. The walls were faced with burnt bricks, as was each corner platform, and three steps led into the tank. Earthenware pipes with a brick trough lying parallel were in the northeastern corner. Water flowed into the reser- voir through the pipes and the trough (Fig. io). 4 See also B. P. Denike, "Le Decor en stucco sculpte d'un edifice fouille a Termez," Mem.

The pictures in relief on the obverse side of the medallions refer to eight subjects: (i) an eight-petalled rosette, in a double circle, con- sisting of a center and a row of closely set pearls (Fig. iI); (2) a medallion bearing a Kufic in- scription, with plant ornaments around the letters and at the edges; the inscription is faint and reads either "king" or "kingdom"; (3) the figure of an animal running to the left, encircled by an Arabic inscription which reads "for the most high Sultan 'Abd al-Muzaffar Bahram Shah." This in- scription may refer either to the ruler of Ghazni, Yamin al-Dawla Bahram Shah ibn Mas'uid (III8-57 A.D.) or to Bahr,am Shah ibn 'Imad al- Din, the ruler of Termez in I205 A.D.; (4) a bird of prey, clawing to pieces some small animal; ('5) a bird of prey, holding an animal in its claws (Fig. I2); (6) a lion in a circle (Fig. I3); (7) a woman standing beside a horse; and (8) a horseman, wearing a crown surrounded by a halo, holding the reins in his right hand and with a hunting bird [falcon?] on his left forearm (Fig. 14).

Two streets could be traced, one along the eastern and the other along the southern boundary of the quarter. The former divided the quarter from the other part of the city, where a large amount of clay slag, potsherds, and tools employed in pottery-making were found. This was the potter's quarter. Excavations in the metalworkers' quarter were begun at several different levels. The cul- tural strata attained a thickness of 5 meters. The upper levels, at a depth to I.5 meters, were attributed to the eleventh to the thirteenth cen- turies of our era, the lower deposits to the Kushan period. Many more or less regular palmate pieces of metal, weighing from 500 grammes to 5 kilogrammes, were found on the surface and during excavation. Pig iron served as raw mate- rial for the metal craftsmen of ancient Termez. In the upper strata fragments of crucibles (which do not relate to iron production), pieces of alloy and polymetallic ores, as well as copper frag- ments, all point to the existence of copperware and forges. The presence of jewelers' shops in this quarter was proved by the discovery of spe- cial furnaces used in this craft. Three small buildings excavated were evidently used for trad- ing, since they were open to the street on one side. Behind these premises were the manufac- turing buildings and the remains of the furnaces and ironware. Other rooms connecting with the stores served as living quarters for the appren- tices and workers. Fragments of an arch of burnt bricks have been found beneath these trading premises, which are attributed to the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. In the lower strata, more than I.5 meters beneath the surface, were found shards and coins of the first centuries of our era. In addition, iron moldings similar to those from the upper levels were excavated. The material obtained shows that manufac- turing existed at Airtam during a period of a thousand to twelve hundred years and that pot- tery-making, the jeweler's craft, and glass and copper work flourished in Termez during the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. One section of the Termez expedition investi- gated the ancient irrigation system along the Surkhan-Darya within the precincts of the Ter- mez district. On the right bank of the river were found remains of ancient head structures and canals, one of which near Salavat irrigated the territory of old Termez. On the left bank, in the middle reaches of the Surkhan-Darya, traces have been found of large irrigation canals leading to Airtam. Potsherds collected on the left bank are similar to those from the lowest levels in the ancient city of Termez and to some from Airtam. These include a thin-walled, engobe pottery, f rag- ments of goblet-like vessels and painted khumi. The results of the investigations on the irriga- tion structures and on the pottery excavated give reason to affirm that the irrigation structures on the left bank of the Surkhan-Darya, requiring large-scale organized labor for their preservation and maintenance, fell into a state of disrepair and neglect about the middle of the first millennium of our era. The direct result was a decline in the life of Airtam and other settlements on the left bank of the river. The Zarafshan expedition was engaged in re- connoitering and excavating to the northwest of Bukhara in the Kizil Kum Desert. The area under investigation, covering about 500 square kilometers, abounds in the ruins of ancient set- tlements, castles, the remains of ramparts and irrigation channels, and a large amount of buried material. The ruins of settlements and castles, built of unburnt brick or pakhs, now have the appearance of mounds (tappas), partly denuded as a result of erosion by precipitation, aeolian action, and, sometimes, drifting sand, which has covered a large part of this locality. Several of these mounds, including Besh Tappa and Ayak Tappa, the irrigation channels, and the denuded remains of clay structures lie at the extreme</page><page sequence="7">FIG. 7 PLAN AND CROSS SECTION OF SMWALL CAVE.

The objects from this region appear to be older than those from sites closer to the modern boundary of the Bukhara oasis. In the district of Besh Tappa and Ayak Tappa was found thin-walled, wheel-made pot- tery, of finely powdered clay, well fired and fre- quently coated with a red slip containing traces of complete or partial burnishing and sometimes embellished with a stamp ornament. Associated with this pottery were bronze tribladed arrow heads of Scythian type. The mounds situated closer to the oasis, in- cluding Dingil Tappa, Katta, Khodia Ishan, and Warakhsha, yielded material relating to the pe- riod from the eighth to the twelfth centuries of our era. Some mounds directly adjacent to the oasis belong to the period of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Excavations were begun at Warakhsha, which was one of the residences of the Bukhar-Khudats. This city was situated in the desert I2 kilo- meters west of the modern oasis. Excavations were concentrated on the ruins of a large build- ing on the western side of the citadel, attributed to the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Within this building, constructed of large unburnt bricks, six rooms were cleared. Numerous fragments of stucco carving, bearing ornamental motifs, were concentrated in one room. The majority of the designs consisted of carvings in low relief of geo- metric and stylized vegetable meanders, rosettes, and palmettes of rhombics and crosses arranged in a geometric pattern. There was also carving in high relief, some of which merges into true sculpture. This method is used for depicting dif- ferent themes and for realistic treatment of birds, fish, fantastic beings, a winged horse, a bird with a female head and breast, a male torso, fragments of human figures, trunks of large trees with branches, and carved leaves (Figs. 15-I8). A large room with wide clay benches was un- earthed in the central part of the building. Traces of a unique distemper painting on clay plaster were observed on one of the walls of this room. The wall is divided into two horizontal parts by a cornice. Above the cornice, on a vivid red-ocher background are to be seen figures of animals, in- cluding a deer, tiger, panther, and a horse, shown moving toward the left. The upper part of the panel has not been preserved. Hunting scenes are depicted on the section beneath the cornice. In sequence come the drivers, dressed in short breeches and cloaks, mounted on white ele- phants; following them are hunters armed with spears and bows. The elephants are outfitted sumptuously with colored saddlecloths and har- ness. One scene depicts a hunter hurling his lance at a lion that has leaped at him with fangs bared. In another episode a hunter has loosed his arrows at a griffin. The lion is painted in orange- yellow, and the griffin in white; the contours of the figures are outlined in black and brown. Al- though shadow planes and perspective are lack- ing the firm painting and the bold strokes reveal the touch of an experienced master. The colors have preserved their freshness, although many parts of the human figures were obliterated in ancient times. This building, lavishly decorated in stucco work and painting, is identified with the palace of the Bukh_r-Khudats described by Muhamad Narshakhl, a tenth-century historian, who wrote that this palace, built more than a thousand years before his time, had been repeatedly demolished and restored. Simultaneously, the expedition excavated some trial trenches, the lower strata yielding pot- tery and other objects dating approximately to the eve of our era and resembling the material from Besh Tappa and Ayak Tappa. Archeological data and the discovery of arti- ficial irrigation structures give reason to assert that the territory investigated was populous even before the beginning of our era. On the extreme western parts of the site civilization began to die</page><page sequence="12">I48 NOTES out about the time of the birth of Christ; the more eastern sections, which are higher than the irrigation systems and closer to the Zarafshan River, continued to exist down to the twelfth century. The reasons for this decline can be found in the upheavals brought about by the dissolution of the slave-owning society and the resultant neglect of the irrigation system, supple- mented by the intensive advance of the sands of Kizil Kum on the Bukhara oasis. II During the latter part of I939 the Zarafshan archeological expedition was sent out jointly by the Institute for the History of Material Culture (IIMK) and the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. The expedition leader was A. IA. IAkubovskii.Y One group excavated at Paikand near IAka- tut on the Ashkhabad railroad in the Bukhara region. The extensive ruins of Paikand are on a stony prominence in a sandy desert. The shahr- istan, surrounded by partly preserved walls, oc- cupied an area of 2o hectares. The citadel (kuhan-diz) covered an area of about i hectare in the northeastern section of the shahristan, which formed the eastern and the more ancient part of the city; also the western area, in which not only walls, but also towers have been partly preserved, was excavated. The towers, originally of unbaked brick, were later strengthened by a 5 These notes were excerpted from A. IA.

Remains of the gates were found at the north, south, and west corners of the shahristan. They were particularly well preserved at the place where the inner wall, which bisects the shahristdn, meets the south and north walls. This discovery throws new light on al-Mada'ini's statement, endorsed by al-Tabarl, that the Arab general 'Ubaid Allah b. Ziyad at Paikand in the spring of 54 H. (674 A.D.), who was recalled to Iraq by 57 H. (676 A.D.) at the latest and died there in 67 H. (686 A.D.), SUC- ceeded in capturing only one half of Paikand in the year 674. V. A. Shishkin mapped the vicinity of the gorodishche; to the west, south, and east it is surrounded by the remains of structures forming the rabat of the town. Ac- cording to al-Makdisi and Narshakhi the town was surrounded by a thousand rabat's, in which during the winter the people from the sur- rounding villages congregated for defense against the Turkish nomads. The rabats nearest the shahristan served in peacetime as caravanserais and during warfare as outposts against the nomads. The entire area of the Paikand gorodishche was covered with potsherds, the majority un- glazed. The greater part of the pottery belonged to the period from the eighth to the tenth century, although some earlier periods were represented, and some potsherds of the Timur (I336-I404) and Timurid (fifteenth century) periods were also found. The most common type of unglazed pottery was decorated with stamped and incised ornament. Surface finds included also many orna- mented lids of cylindrical vessels. Sasanian ele- ments were discernible in the glazed sherds of the eighth to the tenth century. Some sherds closely related to the Afrasiyab type of pottery are unique. Two preliminary excavations were also con- ducted at Paikand. The first trial trench reached virgin rock at a depth of 3.5 meters. The most important object found was a copper coin of the Sasanian cycle, probably of Sogdian origin.</page><page sequence="13">NOTES I49 The second excavation, conducted in the cita- del, was not completed. The finds from the upper strata included some Timurid sherds, dating from the fifteenth century. It is supposed that at that time a fortress had been constructed over the ruins of the Paikand citadel. During excavation of a potter's kiln in the eastern part of the shahristan two Samanid coins were found: one coin of Nasr b. Ahmed b. Isma'll, called al-Sa'ld, who reigned from 30I to 332 H. (9I3-43 A.D.), which was minted in Bukhara, and the other of 'Abd al-Malik I b. Nfih, who reigned from 343 to 350 H. (954-6I A.D.). Accordingly, the pottery associated with this locality could be dated in the tenth century. The cleaning of the kiln resulted in the dis- covery of several animal effigies. Beneath the kiln M. M. D'iakonov discovered a dwelling complex with a small courtyard containing a pit- shaped bread oven and a trough built of baked brick. In one house a coin of Abu 'l-'Abbas al- Saffah, minted in al-Kufa in the year 133 H. (750-5I A.D.), was found at a depth of 75 centi- meters. The typical ware was covered with a dark green glaze, decorated with a stamped or incised pattern reminiscent of Sasanian style. The study of this pottery, showing survivals of Sasanian art, will fill the gap existing between the pre-Muslim period (seventh century) and the Samanid period (tenth century). Several silver coins and I40 copper coins were found on the surface at Paikand. A. A. Bykov identified the following groups: (I) Ku- shan copper coins of the first and second cen- turies A.D.; (2) probably Sogdian coins of the Sasanian cycle, with the characteristic concave surface, and a representation of an altar on one side and a human head on the other; (3) late Sogdian coins of Chinese form with square per- forations in the middle of each coin, one of which bore the name of Tarkhin;6 (4) copper Samanid coins attributed to the tenth century; 6 H. H. Schaeder suggests that this is a title and not a name ("Samarkand," Encycl. Isldm [Leyden, I934], (5) coins of Ilek-Khans; (6) Timurid coins; (7) intrusive Bukharian coins of the nineteenth century. The distribution of coins suggests that the town flourished under the Samanids and de- clined under the Karakhanid Ilek-Khbans. The presence of the Kushan coins of the first cen- tury A.D. indicates the existence of a commercial center at Paikand during that period. The second section of the expedition, under the leadership of G. V. Grigor'ev, excavated at Tali Barzu gorodishche, 6 kilometers south of Samarkand. According to the Arab geographers this area contained the richest estates and forti- fied castles of the native lords (dihkans). In this region belonged also the rich Maimurgh domain, including the town of Rlwdad, the master of which was a rival of the king (Ikhshid) of Samarkand in the fifth and sixth centuries. The Tali Barzu site, excavated since I936, is a square gorodishche with an area of 5 hec- tares. The central part of the hill is elevated i8 meters above the level of the plain. The gorodishche consisted of a complex of buildings belonging to various periods. During the course of three years Grigor'ev established the follow- ing six cultural strata at Tali Barzu: I. First half of the first millennium B.C. II. Fourth century B.C. (Achaemenian period). III. Third to second centuries B.C. (Hellenistic period). IV. First century B.C. to second century A.D. (Kushan period). V. Fifth to seventh centuries A.D. (late Sasa- nian period). VI. End of the seventh to the beginning of the eighth century A.D. The finds include Sasanian pottery with stamped images of pomegranates and Sogdian coins of the seventh or the eighth century. A hoard of twenty-nine Kushan silver coins, with- IV, I29).</page><page sequence="14">NOTES out inscriptions but with a human head on one side and an archer on the other, was also found. An excavation conducted in the potters' quarter at Kafir Kal'a, 5 kilometers south of Tali Barzu, yielded many Sasanian objects. The pottery was stamped with pomegranate designs and had flakes of mica on the surface. Human and animal figurines of terra cotta and a clay slab with an effigy of a human head in high relief were unearthed. Excavations were conducted also at five other sites. A fragment of a storage vessel bearing the image of Gopat-Shah (the bull with a human face) was discovered. This vessel is being de- scribed by C. V. Trever in a special study.7 Another of these excavations brought to light anthropomorphic heads of Hellenistic type. These effigies had served to decorate the handles of vessels. HENRY FIELD and EUGENE PROSTOV "PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN EGYPT." AN EXHIBITION The exhibition held at the Brooklyn Museum from the end of January until early in March, I94I, represented the first attempt at a compre- hensive showing of Coptic art in the United States, and the effort met with general praise and approval. While the material was very simply and hence most effectively displayed, because of the difficulty of assigning precise dates to many of the pieces included, no effort was made to fol- low a historical continuity in the arrangement of the works of art-executed in the period from the first to the eleventh centuries of the Christian era. An easy calculation demonstrates the impor- tance which the show had both to the scholarly specialist and to the casual visitor: of the 271 objects displayed, 2I8 had not received previous notice in print, and of this latter number some 7 "Gopat-Sah le Roi-berger," Travaux du Departe- ment Oriental, Musee de 'Ermitage (Leningrad, I940), II, 71-85 (in Russian), 86 (French resume). 127 pieces were illustrated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The largest category of the exhibits was that of the textiles. The amount of such material in large and small museums and in private hands is really astounding, and this sheer weight of num- bers suggests that a study of the woven pieces offers the soundest basis for clarifying the char- acteristics of Coptic art. Just as noteworthy were objects of less familiar character: basalt portrait heads, multicolored marble vases, and a variety of objects in bronze. Pieces from the great mu- seums did not always command the most at- tention, for most important material came from less accessible sources, such as Goucher College, Cooper Union Museum, Pratt Institute, Textile Museum of the District of Columbia, and the collections of Dr. W. R. Valentiner and Professor V. G. Simkhovitch-to name only a few. Since the close of the exhibition the Brooklyn Museum has been able to acquire a number of the fine privately owned pieces for its permanent collec- tion. The catalogue of the show was handsomely printed and contained excellent illustrations. It included two compact and valuable sections of text by John D. Cooney and Elizabeth Riefstahl, who were the motivating forces of the exhibition. The articles call attention to the problems of Coptic art and stress the fact that the Coptic period must be considered from a number of dif- ferent angles, and that the general political, eco- nomic, and religious manifestations of the time supply the clues needed in drawing up a compre- hensive account of the artistic activity of these centuries. The problems stressed have a familiar sound: what period and area should the term "Coptic" designate; what are the sources of Cop- tic style; how can Coptic style be characterized? The last point is most important, for it is strik- ingly true that only very limited efforts have been made to define Coptic style, i.e., to isolate the peculiar features of composition, drawing, posi- tion of figures in relation to the picture plane, use I50</page></plain_text>
