<plain_text><page sequence="1">Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History Benjamin Steege Abstract Hermann von Helmholtz's theory of melodic "affinity," which he considered his primary contribution to music-theoretical thought, is inherently historicist in its conception. It seeks not only to explain local tonal relationships but also to provide a rationale for transhistorical change in musical structures. Yet this historical dimension, in many ways typical of its era, is complicated by a tenuous balance between the determinism demanded by rigorous scientific explanation and Helmholtz's evident desire to preserve a complex role for the "choice" of fundamental aesthetic principles. Such principles would include the very parameters of modern tonal- ity, so the status of tonal "affinity," a seemingly given and predictable attribute of musical tones, coexists uneas- ily in Helmholtz's writing with a humanist appreciation for the unpredictability of cultural choice and change. It also throws the physiological basis of his music theory into conflict with his ostensibly progressive treatment of non-European musics. Such tensions, along with unevenly successful efforts to resolve them, were by no means atypical of the liberal discourse of his intellectual milieu. Indeed, the unresolved challenge of reconciling a flexible aesthetics and historiography with the logical requirements of positivist knowledge aligns Helmholtz with major liberal thinkers from John Stuart Mill on. reflecting on the historical turn of nineteenth-century musical thought, Carl Dahlhaus once mused that the "sole historicist among nineteenth-century music theorists" was, ironically, neither a Goethean humanist like Moritz Hauptmann nor an erudite Musikwissenschaftler like Hugo Riemann, but rather the "distinguished physicist and physiologist" Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-94). Helmholtz, Dahlhaus supposed, "knew the rules of rigorous scien- tific explanation far better than his theorizing musical colleagues, who naively turned to physics in order to create a basis for music theory that would enable it, too, to partake of the dignity and inviolability of the natural sciences" (Dahl- haus 1989, 322-23). 1 Without saying as much, this assessment indicates the importance of a sometimes overlooked ethical agenda underlying Helmholtz's theoretical project around 1860. Briefly, in order to shore up the integrity of All translations from German are mine, except where noted. 1 The point is expanded in Dahlhaus 1971. For some time, it appeared that Dahlhaus was alone in appreciating the discipline-critical aspect of Helmholtz's work; but see the echoes of his assessment in, for example, Blaukopf 1982, 63-66; and Cook 2002, 88-89.

In rhetoric that, I will maintain, stems from ethical commitments characteristic of the national liberalism that Helmholtz exemplified for his generation, he instructs us "that the modern system [of tonality] was developed not from a natural necessity, but from a freely chosen principle of style; that beside it, and before it, other tonal systems have been developed from other principles" (1896, 410; 1954, 249; emphasis added).4 The ideologemes "freedom," "choice," and "progress" are, it must be acknowledged, extraordinarily crude, freighted with all manner of baggage making it somewhat uncomfortable to discuss them candidly in the context of music-theoretical discussion.5 Fully aware of this potential awkwardness, the following essay aims not to efface hidden conceptual problematics but to draw them out into the light. If it is true that Helmholtz - a prominent member of the Bildungsburgertum (edu- cated bourgeoisie) and a proponent of national educational reforms high- lighting the ascendant role of natural science for the public good - tended broadly toward the "liberal progressive," then we can hardly engage such terms innocently, and it will be instructive to pursue a reading that draws out some of their less obvious effects within his musical writings. 2 This intellectual and academic-political background is dis- cussed at greater length in Kohnke 1991. For further analysis of Helmholtz's project, see Steege 2007. 3 . daft das System derTonleitern, derTonarten und deren Harmoniegewebe nicht auf unveranderlichen Naturgesetzen beruht, sondern daft es die Konsequenzen asthetischer Prin- zipien ist, die mit fortschreitender Entwickelung der Men- schheit einem Wechsel unterworfen gewesen sind und ferner noch sein werden." This entire passage is typographi- cally emphasized in all editions of the book. From the third edition (1870) on, the passage was subtly but significantly altered.

We can fairly conclude that it was not strictly harmonic in character, contrary to a long tradition of Helmholtz interpretation following the Riemannian inflection of his immediate interlocutors. Helmholtz's most direct theoretical arguments involve the notion of Tonverwandtschaft , or "tonal affinity," which underpins the final third of his treatise, Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage fur die Theorie derMusik (1863). To be sure, parts 1 and 2 of that book study isolated tones, dyads, chords, and the effects of their sustained interaction, and Helmholtz ultimately develops from these steady-state laboratory "objects" a deceptively modest theory of conso- nance that sparked decades of contention and revision among harmonic the- orists.6 But part 3, a more than 200-page treatise-within-a-treatise titled "The Affinity of Musical Tones" (Die Verwandtschaft der Klange) , in contrast elabo- rates a theory of melody or tonal progression. These latter chapters privilege change, both in the sense of relationships between tones succeeding one another within some individual musical context, and also in the sense of his- torical changes, over the span of many centuries, in theoretical discourse about tone relationships. Despite the relative remoteness of such topics from the area in which he was already recognized as an authority (sensory physiol- ogy) , Helmholtz considered the theory of melody his most important contribu- tion to musical thought, whereas he dismissed his better known physiological theory of consonance as "a mere summary of observable facts." The preface to the third edition of Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen (1870, reprinted in sub- sequent editions) clarifies: I consider it a mistake to make the theory of consonance the essential founda- tion of the theory of music, and I was of the opinion that this was clearly enough expressed in my book. The essential basis of music is melody . In Western Euro- pean music of the last three centuries, harmony has become an essential and, for our taste, indispensable means of strengthening melodic affinities (Ver- wandtschaften ) . But finely cultivated music existed for thousands of years without harmony, and such music still exists today among non-European peoples. (1896, ix-x; 1954, vii)7 Melody's significance thus sprang from historical assumptions: melodic formations were supposed to have developed prior to harmony and must therefore be acknowledged as the starting point for any theoretical derivation of current practice. 6 Helmholtz's famous ambivalence toward the minor triad as an acoustic "object" is familiarly acknowledged to have provoked at a stroke the movement of what became known as harmonic dualism. Sefc Rehding 2003, 15-35. 7 "Ich halte es fur einen Fehler, wenn man die Theorie der Konsonanz zur wesentlichen Grundlage der Theorie der Musik macht, und ich war der Meinung, dies deutlich genug in diesem Buche ausgesprochen zu haben. Die wesentliche Basis der Musik ist die Melodie. Die Harmonie ist in der westeuropaischen Musik der letzten drei Jahrhunderte ein wesentliches und unserem Geschmack unentbehrliches Verstarkungsmittel der melodischen Verwandtschaften geworden, aber es hat Jahrtausende lang fein ausgebildete Musik ohne Harmonie gegeben, und gibt noch jetzt solche bei den aufcereuropaischen Volkern."</page><page sequence="4">286 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Yet this foray into writing history, ostensibly driven by commonsense intuitions about the workings of musical culture, was a methodological gam- ble for a scientist otherwise oriented toward experiment and calculation. Since, as already suggested, Helmholtz's vision of music-historical progress celebrated some notion of aesthetic "choice," it is natural to question what sort of choosing he had in mind. We might assume that choice, after all, would come down to self-conscious moments of punctual decision. But it is unclear how to reconcile Helmholtz's idea of a "freely chosen principle of style" with a peculiarly intertwined music theory and historiography that assumes such a principle was "certainly never developed into a system by the artists themselves with conscious intention and consistency." What, then, could be the relation between the thought and the unthought in a music theory "where the peculiar physiological functions of the ear, while not immediately present to conscious self-examination, play an important part" in grounding the "the necessity of the technical rules for each individual direction in the development of our art" (1896, 387; 1954, 235)? Helmholtz's historiography was constitutively hybrid - neither fully ide- alist or weltgeschichtlich a la Hegel, nor fully materialist-sensualist (the two predominant alternatives of the time) - but also not entirely free from the potentially deterministic assumptions of either mode of thought. This prompts the question, how and why did Helmholtz's ostensibly "free" aesthetic domain remain haunted by the very intellectual and physiological determinisms the scientist himself was at pains to dismiss? In examining the relations among Helmholtz's music theory, historiography, and liberal political vision, which necessarily (if implicitly) collide in Helmholtz's writing on tonal theory, the following discussion proceeds in two broad stages: first, an exposition of how the theory of tonal affinity seamlessly extended itself into a novel his- torical explanatory mode, and second, some reflections on how Helmholtz's participation in a liberal ethos (however veiled) ensnared him in what we might think of as the "structural uncertainties" or "undecidability" of nineteenth-century liberal discourse in the large. The first half reads Helmholtz in exchange with several historiographical interlocutors, above all the philosopher Rudolf Hermann Lotze, now largely forgotten but of inestimable importance in the intellectual milieu we are studying here, where his critical analyses of the character of historical (and musical) "progress" will help to refine our interpretative aims with regard to Helmholtz. The second half casts a wider textual net, drawing injohann Wolfgang von Goethe, Eduard Hanslick, and John Stuart Mill, among others, in moving from an exegesis of the surprisingly complex central theoretical term, Verwandtschaft , toward an appreciation of how a natural-scientific program could have been thought to open up, as if within itself, room for reconciliation between its own determinates and the indeterminacies of human culture.</page><page sequence="5">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 287 The History of "Affinity" Helmholtz's theory of tonal affinity required just two seemingly intuitive assumptions, which were nevertheless of a distinctly speculative psychological character: first, that what is normally thought of as a singular tone sensation is in fact composed of a manifold bundle of discrete sensations, which the ear habitually associates, creating a single perception; and second, that despite this unconscious synthesis, listeners tend, even under ordinary circumstances, to retain some intuitive "feeling" for the presence of the constituent sensa- tions, the partial tones. On the basis of the potential for greater or lesser degrees of coincidence between the partials of any two tones, Helmholtz sup- posed that a tone would sound inherently more related ( verwandt ) to some tones than to others. Further, he assumed that the gradual, transepochal task of constructing a "coherent" collection of tones came down to cultivating a sense for this gradation of similarity and difference, and to selecting and grouping together the tones that were most perceptibly related to one another. All of this was to be (or already had been) accomplished through "groping efforts" and a productive "play of the imagination" (1896, 387; 1954, 235). Ultimately, a feeling for affinity was to be cultivated not merely from one tone to the next in some kind of temporal succession, but also in a more encompassing sense. This sense turns out to be precisely that "freely chosen principle of style" Helmholtz had celebrated: "As the fundamental principle for the development of the European tone system we propose that the entire collection of tones and harmonic connections is to be set in a close and consistently dis- tinct relationship (Verwandtschaft) to a freely chosen tonic pitch; and that the collec- tion of tones for an entire piece develops from that pitch and finds its way back to it again" Insisting that "this principle ... is an aesthetic one, not a natural one," Helmholtz still maintained that the principle had been uninterruptedly, though unconsciously, in effect from the time of ancient monophony to the present (1896, 410-11; 1954, 249; emphasis original).8 The theoretical notion of "affinity" retained a certain fluidity and flexibility, as it perhaps needed to do in order to remain applicable to an enormous range of "historical and national differences of taste" (1896, 386; 1954, 234). Such differences would include, Helmholtz noted, the very extent to which one was disposed to culti- vate a feeling for affinity at all - for example, whether one stopped with recog- nizing the varying affinities of some tone for its octave, its fifth, or its major third, or proceeded to acknowledge such affinity up to distinctions finer than the ancient Greek or modern European diatonic semitones. ("Which interval we may admit as the smallest in a scale is a question that is answered differently by different nations according to the different orientation of their taste, and 8 "Als Grundprincip fur die Entwickelung des europaischen Tonsystems stellen wir die Forderung auf, dal 3 die ganze Masse c ier Tone und Harmonieverbindungen in enge und stets deutliche Verwandtschaft zu einer frei gewahlten Tonica zu setzen sei, dad aus dieser sich die Tonmasse des ganzen Satzes entwickele und in sie wieder zurucklaufe. . . . Dieses Princip ist aber . . . ein asthetisches, kein naturli- ches" (emphasis original).</page><page sequence="6">288 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY perhaps also according to the different refinement of their ear" [1896, 425; 1954, 257]. )9 Certainly, the idea of "affinity" in the context of music theoretical writ- ings had a venerable heritage by 1863. One might date it back as far as Guido of Arezzo's eleventh-century construction of a "doctrine of affinities" ( affini - tas) in particular modal contexts, and it would be possible to trace a loose thread up through Johann Mattheson's idea of the "affinity" ( Verwandtschafft ) of keys or modes in the early eighteenth century (1735). 10 In general, such constructs tended to support an extended project of defining relations between larger classes of theoretical objects such as modes, scales, and keys. Significantly, these earlier usages did not include the notion that the empiri- cal acoustic quality of an individual tone might, on its own , suggest affinity with other tones, beyond any larger modal, scalar, tonal, or other context. Yet this would become the specific concept that served as Helmholtz's main point of orientation in the Tonempjindungen. Rather than stemming directly from a music-theoretical tradition, it seems to have coincided precisely with the emer- gence of historicist visions of tonality as found in, for example, the musico- logical writings of Carl von Winterfeld (1784-1852) and Raphael Georg Kiesewetter (1773-1850). These historian-philologists were two of Helmholtz's principal historiographical sources, and he seems to have adopted not only the basic "facts" of history they transmitted but also the rhetoric of affinity that surfaces at various points in their historical writings. Indeed, there is an intimate relationship between the subtly empiricist connotations of their ideas about tonal affinity and the historiographical impulse, inherited by Helmholtz, to imagine music history as a narrative of the developing con- sciousness of musical reason driven by sensitivity to the material resources borne by the singular musical tone.11 Writings such as Kiesewetter's and Winterfeld 's deploy both marked and unmarked uses of the term Verwandtschaft. It surfaces suddenly and arbitrarily and is thus relatively unmarked in Kiesewetter's pathbreaking 1842 study of Arab and Persian music. Assessing the status of fourteenth-century Persian modal theory, Kiesewetter declares himself "unable to recognize a unifying 9 "Welches Intervall wir als das engste in der Scala zulas- sen durfen, ist eine Frage, die von verschiedenen Nationen nach ihren verschiedenen Geschmacksrichtungen, vielleicht auch nach der verschiedenen Feinheit ihres Ohres verschie- den beantwortet ist." 10 For the most complete discussion of the origins of the musical term, affinitas, see Pesce 1987. Mattheson's usage persisted at least as late as Weber 1824, 69-86. 11 While such formulations readily smack of Hegelianism, Hegel's significance for his rough contemporaries Kiesewet- ter and Winterfeld is unclear. A good overview of their respective historiographical standpoints is Meier 1969. The case is even less straightforward for Helmholtz, who openly disdained the Idealist legacy in natural scientific pursuits but appears to have been less overtly critical of its continued influence on humanistic disciplines. The recognition of his own inability to pass judgment on the discipline of history as a whole was grounded in a fundamental belief in the neces- sity for an academywide division of intellectual labor, yet ironically enough, this belief in turn required precisely the rejection of any universalizing Hegelianism that might seek to transcend isolated modes of knowledge, a rejection that he evidently did not carry through for the study of history itself. For further discussion of the generational embrace of an academic division of labor (and its relationship to an anti-Hegelian turn), see Steege 2007, 9-17.</page><page sequence="7">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 289 system in the melodic formulas of the maqamat but still cannot deny "their practical usefulness" and thus holds that "from this fact in particular . . . shines a presentiment - if still very uncertain - of the melodic affinities ( Ver- wandtschaften) of the essential tones of a scale" (1842, 48). 12 The "presenti- ment," or Ahnung, of affinity here occupies an ambiguous position between self-conscious knowledge and the mere promise of it for some unspecified future, which, on Kiesewetter's logic, would necessarily be identified with modern European harmonic tonality. (Helmholtz, for one, chastised Kiesewetter for his "exaggerated zeal to deny everything which will not fit into the scheme of major and minor modes" [1896, 389-90; 1954, 236].) The sentiment that "affinity" might be situated on a spectrum parallel to, or overlaid upon, some historical continuum had a clear precedent in Winterfeld's study Johannes Gabrieli und sein Zeitalter (1834). The Berlin musi- cologist had already developed the idea of emergent melodic affinity more thoroughly and explicitly than would Kiesewetter, especially in his discussion of emerging modal patterns in liturgical chant repertories.13 But a substantial difference between Kiesewetter and Winterfeld appears in the latter's ten- dency to ascribe some agency behind affinity to the tones themselves. Thus, rather than musing on past musicians' hypothetical sensitivity (of lack thereof) to the qualities of tones in relation to other tones, Winterfeld observes how "affine" ( verwandte ) tones "join themselves" (sich gesellen) to each other in a modal collection. By associating themselves with one another in the particular ways that they do, these tones "reveal what lives like a soul within them; they unfold what lies hidden within their sealed bud" (1834, 73). 14 The organicist rhetoric might be dismissed as period cliche were it not that Winterfeld's pos- tulation of melodic affinity introduced (without fanfare) an unprecedented tacit theory of the impetus for change in musical structures. What is at issue here is the life of tones as a specific era recognized it from one particular standpoint; what is at issue is a view of this life as it presented itself in works of that time more than in . . . theory , which was not adequate fully to ascer- tain this life. This view rests upon a given, the diatonic scale. [It rests] upon the manner of constructing that scale from individual tones. ... It is grounded, fur- ther, on the relationships and affinities (Beziehungen und Verwandtschaften) of the 12 "Ob ich nun in diesen Formeln, die alsTonarten angege- ben und benannt sind, ein verbindendes System zwar nicht zu erkenne vermag, kann ich jedoch deren praktische Anwendbarkeit (als melodischer Formeln) nicht verkennen, und besonders scheint mir daraus eine, wenn auch noch sehr unsichere Ahnung melodischer Verwandtschaften, der in einerTonleiter wesentlichenTone hervorzuleuchten. Nach unserer (europaischen) Ansicht waren diese Perser auf dem besseren Wege; obgleich eingezwangt in die Schienen solcher willkuhrlichen Formeln, die Musik auch auf diesem Wege zu ewiger Kindheit hatte verdammt bleiben mussen." For more on Kiesewetter, see Bohlman 1986. 13 As Winterfeld's subtitle implies, the book's broadest sug- gestion is that Western music experienced its most funda- mental shift toward some form of modern harmonic tonality in the context of the Venetian music of the generations from Adrian Willaert to Giovanni Gabrieli. Despite its apparently restricted topic, then, Winterfeld offered the study as a fun- damental thesis about the emergence of a particular form of musical modernity. 14 "Sie sagen aus, was in dieser als ihrer Seele lebt, sie entfalten, was in ihr, der verschlossenen Knospe, verborgen ruht."</page><page sequence="8">290 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY tones, as Nature reveals them to us in the development of one from the other. [It is grounded] upon a natural law, which was intuited vividly within, recognized through experience as binding, even though it was nowhere definitely expressed as such in theory. (74) 15 It is worth noting, first, how Winterfeld 's prose conveys a delicate bal- ance between a natural agency that "reveals" musical relationships and a human agency that "intuits" them. Yet the latter essentially falls by the way- side, in favor of a mechanism acting beyond the purview of rational thought ("theory"). Though he never refers explicitly to the discourse of acoustics, Winterfeld clearly understands "Nature" to produce a quality of difference within the unity of tone by providing the upper octave and twelfth as a basis for the affinity of one tone for its upper octave and, less so, for its upper fifth (and so on). It is specifically this internal difference within the singular tone that Winterfeld identified as a kind of "life." And yet, rhetorically, he was committed to the notion that this "life" must remain to some degree con- cealed in order to exert its unique force. Although it was "intuited within" {innerlich geahnt), it could not immediately spring forth and have the same effect as it might when gradually felt over the course of time: "Invented form - even if it has been repressed (verdrdngt) at one point, just like the intuition of the tone-world from which it grew - must, according to its essence and its entire meaning, be reconstituted before we can be allowed to demonstrate how it came to be" (74). 16 This is a statement not only of Winterfeld's historio- graphical method but also of his conviction that history itself depends on a kind of interplay between the "repression" of available sensations and their (re)discovery through retrospective observation. The ultimate reference point in Winterfeld's prose, then, is more often than not a certain kind of empirical contact with tone in some particular, if unspecified, musical con- text. "The path which our presentation has chosen and followed thus far, leads our attention to sound alone " (73; emphasis added).17 Such contact with the singular but internally differentiated tone was the founding moment in music's myth of origin according to Winterfeld, as much as to Helmholtz, who succinctly affirmed in an 1869 letter to Gustav Fechner: "I believe . . . that music would never have been invented had the relationships of the overtones 15 "Von dem Leben derTone, wie es eine bestimmte Zeit, von einem einzelnen, besonderen Standpunkte aus erkannte, ist hier die Rede; von einer Anschauung diese Lebens, wie sie in der Werken jener Zeit mehr, als in der . . . ihrer Bestimmung nicht gentigenden Lehre sich darstellt. Auf einem Gegebenen, der diatonischen Leiter, ruhte diese Anschauung; auf der damals allgemein gangbaren Art, die- selbe aus den einzelnen Tonen aufzubauen. ... Sie ist gegrundetferner auf die Beziehungen undVerwandtschaften derTone, wie die Natur in der Entwickelung des einen aus dem andern sie uns offenbart; auf ein damals innerlich leb- haft geahntes, durch die Ausubung als bindend anerkanntes, wenn in der Lehre auch als solches nirgend bestimmt aus- gesprochenes Naturgesetz." 16 "Die erfundene Form, ist sie selber, so wie die Anschau- ung der Tonwelt, aus der sie erwuchs, im Verlaufe der Zeit einmal verdrangt worden, muss ihrem Wesen, ihrer vollen Bedeutung nach, erst wieder hingestellt werden, ehe uns vergonnt sein kann darzulegen, wie sie geworden." 17 "DerWeg . . . , den unsere Darstellung gewahlt, und bisher verfolgt hat, leitet fur unsere Aufmerksamkeit auf den Klang allein" (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="9">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 291 always been missing from tones" (Koenigsberger 1903, 63). 18 Winterfeld and Helmholtz sought not only a rationale for the present configuration of musi- cal relationships in the common practice but also, in one and the same con- ceptual bundle, a rationale for the historical development of that system. Both rationales were referred to the same disposition: the repressed or unconscious intuition of affinity of one tone for another solely on the basis of its distinct properties as an isolated sensation and absent any prior context whatsoever. This proposition was not received without skepticism. Typically cautious to embrace its historiographical implications was the philosopher Rudolf Her- mann Lotze, who reviewed Helmholtz's main theoretical and historical argu- ments in his Geschichte der Aesthetik in Deutschland (1868) five years following the publication of the Tonempfindungen.19 Remarkably, Lotze did not take the great problem of music's historical narrative to be defining its specific ratio- nality or its "logical" development. Instead, the question he posed was, given the apparent inherently rational quality of Western musical theory, why did it take so long for Western musical culture to arrive at the harmonic practice taken as normative by the contemporary moment of the mid-nineteenth cen- tury? Given the "historically late fixing (die geschichtlich spate Festsetzung) of our current tone system and the harmonic theory accompanying it," Lotze observed, "it is not possible to see how such a fulfillment could have been lack- ing among cultivated and otherwise artistically minded peoples" who predated the arrival of modern harmonic tonality. On the one hand, "it is extremely unlikely that the bodily organization was different at different times," so Helmholtz's argument that the ear is predisposed to analyze the compound musical tone into its constituent simple tones, providing a basis for the privi- leging of certain melodic intervals over others, must obtain for all historical contexts. And, on the other hand, it was just as improbable that the "mechan- ical laws of the ideational process were different from now" (462). If Lotze 's central problem for musical historiography was the belatedness of "reason," he simply brought to the fore a background problematic that informed the structure of both Winterfeld's and Helmholtz's own historical narratives. Where Winterfeld observed a kind of necessary "repression" ( Ver- drangung) of motivating principles, Helmholtz always referred back to a state of constitutive deafness to raw sensation in everyday life. Both viewed the pri- mary relationships from which music was gradually constructed as somewhere already present - not just as ideal essences but as empirically (if only poten- tially) available sensory experience. Such repression or deafness would render any subsequent manifestation of the structure of that experience somehow belated, as if the sensation itself were making a delayed return to the surface of consciousness. Lotze apparently saw such theoretical presuppositions as 18 "Aber ich glaube . . . , Musik ware nie erfunden worden, wenn denTonen immer die Beziehungen der Obertone . . . fehlten." 19 Lotze (1868, 461-504) presents his fullest response to the major monographs by Hanslick and Helmholtz of the previous decade and a half.</page><page sequence="10">292 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY somewhat suspect but ultimately impossible to do without. His critical and characteristic move, however, was to attempt to portray this "lateness" as all the more extraordinary in the face of the overwhelming force of Western music's purported rationality. And yet, despite his general agreement with Helmholtz about the neces- sity of some degree of relativism in evaluating earlier musics, Lotze was deeply concerned about the broader implications of Helmholtz's conviction that music "will continue to be subject to change with the progressive development of humanity." Where Helmholtz envisioned a potentially infinite linear trajec- tory, in no particular privileged direction, into an unpredictable future, Lotze found this effectively antiteleological history too open and instead imagined a gradual, asymptotic approach toward some absolute goal, without also claim- ing that this goal could ever be specified, let alone reached. If Helmholtz considered the graded relationships or affinities of tones "natural" in some sense, he also candidly disavowed the notion that what people did with the affinities followed natural laws. The theory of Verwandtschaft was meant to provide the psychological impetus ( Motiv ) driving the history of tonal systems, but it was not a rigid retroscription for a singular, rational development of musical history. In contrast, Lotze thought that, "in music as in all arts, the range of possibility narrows for the duration of the further developmental stages" (463). 20 In a certain light, though, Lotze 's teleology does recapitulate a conclu- sion one might logically draw from Helmholtz's own narrative of the evolution of diatonic scale systems. As Lotze 's account in Geschichte der Aesthetik in Deutschland acknowledges, Helmholtz had presented this evolution as coex- tensive with a gradual filling in of the octave span (Lotze 1868, 467-68). Fol- lowing the hierarchical implications of the principle of affinity, the first tone to enter into a relational system after the octave above some particular tone would be the fifth above that tone. Thereafter would enter the fourth above the lower boundary (fifth below the upper boundary) of the octave. The order of emergence of the various tones in Helmholtz's quasi-mythical history, then, was a tone, its octave, its fifth, and its fourth. Implicit in the textual arrange- ment of the Tonempftndungen is that the basic organization of tone materials across all "rational" musical cultures shared this fundamental configuration of pitches, representable as, for example, C4-F4-G4-C5 (Example 1). Helmholtz went so far as to suggest that this background interval structure manifested itself in the casual gestures of everyday speech, as indicated in Example 2, where he notates two spoken phrases using a transposition of the fundamental pitch collection (F2-Bb2-C3-F3). 20 "In der Musik wie in alien Kunsten mindert sich der Spiel- raum fur die Weite der ferneren Entwicklungsschritte."</page><page sequence="11">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 293 ^ ' 0 = Example 1 J J- J J' J' j pi 9 9 Ich bin spa-tzie - ren ge-gan - gen. Bist du spa-tzie - ren ge-gan - gen? Example 2 The derivation of this supposedly universal background pitch collection from the principle of tonal affinity sets off a lengthy comparative discussion of an enormous range of musical scales - from those of ancient Greek, classical Arab and Persian, medieval ecclesiastical, Chinese, "modern" European (i.e., post-Renaissance), and even contemporary Scottish and Egyptian musics (Helmholtz 1896, 419-69; 1954, 253-90). 21 With this arrangement as a point of departure, the text of the Tonempfindungen traces a knotty but carefully ordered narrative through diverse manners of filling in the perfect-fourth gaps left open between C4 and F4, and G4 and C5. But most pertinent here is not so much its specific method of deriving the various scales from intervals of closest affinity, but rather the explicit claim that this derivation in fact con- stitutes a retracing or "rediscovery" of actual historical development: "Thus the melodic tonal modes of the Greeks and early Christian church have all been rediscovered ( wiedergefunden ) here according to the consistently pur- sued natural path of derivation" (Helmholtz 1896, 451; 1954, 275). 22 In other words, Lotze's culturally narrow vision of a trajectory for musical reason, exemplified by certain privileged moments and figures (primarily the work of Northern European Protestant musicians in the later parts of the narrative), was not entirely foreign to Helmholtz's thinking. And, as has been noted elsewhere, Helmholtz obligingly qualified his initial bold statement of histori- cal relativism in apparent response to Lotze's skepticism in the third edition of the Tonempfindungen , arriving at the notably weakened formulation (with the words added in 1870 italicized): "The system of scales, modes, and their harmonic fabrics does not rest merely on unchanging natural laws but is rather 21 The passage in question begins (appropriately) with the phrase, "Let us begin with the octave" ("Beginnen wir mit der Octave") and proceeds to the end of chapter 14, with some variation in the different editions of the book. 22 "So sind die melodischen Tongeschlechter der Griechen und der altchristlichen Kirche hier auf dem consequent fortgesetzten naturlichen Wege der Ableitung alle wiedergefunden."</page><page sequence="12">294 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY partly also the consequence of aesthetic principles that are, and will continue to be, subject to change with the progressive development of humanity."23 Yet it was Lotze who, in a work written contemporaneously with the Tonempfind- ungen , articulated apprehensions about the conceptual structure of the notion of progress that by the early 1860s had come to characterize so much natural scientific and liberal thinking. In the sections on "History" and "Progress" in the third volume of his popular Mikrokosmus , originally published in 1864, Lotze introduced an idiosyncratic note of critique into an intellectual atmo- sphere that had perhaps not yet fully begun to sense the potential dangers of uncritical acceptance of ideas of "progressive development." In considering the problem of understanding what was meant by "progress" - progress for whom? by what measures? in comparison with what implicit norms? - Lotze focused on what it might mean for any given individual to experience progress in the course of his or her own life. He insisted that a transhistorical "consciousness," as imagined in so many philosophical, anthropological, and sociological frameworks after Hegel, was irrelevant to the actions of any spe- cific individual: For consciousness does not grow from this inner labor that attained the point from which the individual himself might depart; or at least, it only grows most incompletely. Only the end results [of such labor] appear in a later individual's development as a great number of prejudices , whose rational foundation has been forgotten. Often they may make it possible for him to rise higher than those who preceded him; not much less frequently, as inherited limitations on his field of view, they will hinder him in the development that would have been possible without this historical dependency. But in both cases, the almost sole manner in which the cultivation of earlier times is passed on leads directly back to that which is the opposite of the goal which historical labor ought to have; I mean to the cultivation of an instinct of culture, which continually takes up more and more elements of civilization as a lifeless possession and removes them from the autonomous activity through which they were once obtained. (1872, 27-28) 24 Lotze thus regarded historical progression less as the activity of an ideal unitary consciousness working reflectively and reflexively upon its own forward-striving reason, and more as a series of new beginnings from cultural debris involuntarily inherited from earlier times. One implication of this was that while culture might be interpretable as a kind of sum of the "predilec- tions," "prejudices," or "biases" ( Vorurteile) of received wisdom, it was also the 23 See Dahlhaus 1984, 252-55. 24 "Denn eben von dieser innerlichen Arbeit, welche das errang, wovon er selbst gleich beginnen kann, pflanzt sich das Bewufctsein nicht oder hochst unvollkommen fort; nur die fertigen Ergebnisse treten als eine grofce Summe von Vorurtheilen, deren Begrundung vergessen ist, in die Bildung des Spaterkommenden ein. Oft mogen sie es ihm dann moglich machen, hoher zu steigen als die, die ihm vorangingen; nicht viel seltner werden sie als vererbte Beschrankungen seines Gesichtskreises ihn selbst an der Entwicklung hindern, die ihm ohne diese geschichtliche Abhangigkeit moglich gewesen ware. In beiden Fallen aber fuhrt die Art, wie die Bildung der Vorzeit fast allein uberliefert wird, auf gradem Wege zu dem zuriick, dessen Gegentheil der Zweck der geschichtlichen Arbeit sein sollte; ich meine zu der Bildung eines Instinctes der Cultur, der immer mehr und mehr Elemente der Gesittung ergreift und sie als unle- bendig gewordenen Besitz der Selbstthatigkeit entzieht, durch die sie einst errungen wurden."</page><page sequence="13">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 295 occasion for radical disjunctions in experience. On the basis of the radical privacy of certain kinds of cultural experience, particular individuals have no reason to identify themselves with predecessors in such a way that a historical consciousness might be shared across generations. As a result, one is generally compelled perpetually to begin again, making do with what has been received, but not necessarily in deference to any particular original intent. At the same time, Lotze greets the burden of cultural inheritance with perceptible ambiva- lence. It is both enlightening and deadening. Thus, the notion of progress in his account did not carry with it a clear evaluation as positive or negative, but it does seem to imply a certain resignation or even melancholy.25 The pragmatic notion, typical of the post-1848 generation, that trans- historical progress might be thought of less as a steady development of self-present thought (or coming-to-consciousness) and more as an ambiva- lent refunctioning of cultural inheritance also surfaces in Helmholtz's thinking about the emergence of modern harmonic practice. Indeed, one apparently pedestrian example of this even helps to explain his relative open-mindedness toward music falling beyond the purview of harmonic tonal- ity. Briefly stated, the absence of harmonic principles in earlier music could not be evidence of irrational musical thought, simply because it is "obviously attributing too much to the artist's intellect, unconsciously feeling out a mul- titude of relationships, to claim that it should observe relationships of tones never, or at least seldom, perceived with the corporeal ear, relationships which it was left to a distant afterworld to discover and use" (Helmholtz 1896, 419; 1954, 253). 26 Tonal-harmonic consciousness, then, however it may at one time have come about, appears in Helmholtz's historiography precisely as a kind of prejudice "whose rational foundation has been forgotten/' as Lotze wrote, not a living testament to some continuously self-present mind or spirit. In Helm- holtz's vision, one is not to be rewarded as "rational" simply for operating within the discursive limits of harmonic tonality, since one is no sense respon- sible for its historical development, even if that development were in itself deemed rational. Further, in insisting on the importance of direct contact of the "corpo- real ear" with specific tonal phenomena in order for them to become available for musical use, Helmholtz partially answers Lotze 's interrogation of the "belated" arrival of harmonic logic. Persistent reference to the authority of "immediate" sensation seems to inspire his patience, or even his enthusiasm, for the slow movement of historical development. This may perhaps seem paradoxical, given the more usual function of "the physiological," even in the 25 Walter Benjamin later recognized this as a sign of Lotze's effort to convert the theory of progress into a theory of "redemption," as suggested in the incomplete "Arcades Project" (1999, 478-81), as well as the late essay "On the Concept of History" (2003). 26 "Es ist hier offenbar dem allerdings unbewusst viele Beziehungen herausfuhlenden Kunstlergeiste zu viel zuge- muthet, wenn man behauptet, er solle Beziehungen der Tone beachten, die er nie oder wenigstens nur selten mit leiblichem Ohre vernommen hat, und die erst eine feme Nachwelt herauszufinden und zu benutzen bestimmt war."</page><page sequence="14">296 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY present day, as a tool to naturalize certain aesthetic tendencies over others. But in this case, his appreciation for the precariousness of physiological expe- rience supports a view that one can be held accountable only for what can be engaged empirically rather than theoretically or through rational thought. Just as Lotze explicitly pointed out the substitution of "reasoning" with "preju- dice" from one generation to the next, Helmholtz implies an adherence to inherited habits, which can only be resisted through the occasional undocu- mented and untraceable heightening of sensitivity to raw tone sensations. Finally, then, Helmholtz seems to ascribe to the mechanism of music-historical progress something of the means-ends rationality characteristic of "everyday" habitual perception. That is, once harmonic elements are accepted into a normative language of theory and practice, they rapidly become devalued as just another set of cogs in the wheel of tonality, lifeless possessions whose independent rationale is no longer consciously grasped as such. This sharply contrasts with organicist visions of harmonic tonality, since no sense of self-propagating growth, sustaining an endless recursive renewal of life and rational intellect, is ascribed to the musical materials. Instead, the music-historical agency implicitly postulated here is closely circumscribed, capable only of irrationally perpetuating received habits, though expanding them incrementally through a dimly grasped response to the marginal phe- nomena of acoustics. Lotze 's idea of the "microcosm" of private experience - as the title of his popular Mikrokosmus suggests - was arguably meant to answer the need for a worldview adequate to the familiar situation of the private individual in mod- ern bourgeois life, rather than to a more elevated figure of transhistorical knowledge and power. Likewise, Helmholtz's modest image of an intuitive, quotidian empiricism driving music-historical change would seem an appro- priate characterization of the mode of knowledge of such an individual: it is neither irredeemably ignorant nor all-knowing; pragmatic in its everyday functioning, yet aiming at perpetual betterment or enrichment of its scope and experience; answerable to the contingency of its raw physical condition, but with an eye toward the reasonable ideal of art that was ultimately imagin- able beyond the framework of means-ends thought; operating rationally within the limits of its own private experience while remaining in dialogue with the peculiarity of cultural habits. The Temporality of "Affinity" If Helmholtz's music-historical subject, in its casual empirical engagements with unconscious everyday habits, maintained a tenuous ability to break those habits from time to time, this subject was hardly taken for granted by the wider community of musicians, critics, and theorists in the 1850s and 1860s. In par- ticular, the image of the mechanically groping subject of insular private expe- rience must be read against persistently organicist rhetoric associated with</page><page sequence="15">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 297 Hauptmann and Hanslick, among others. It remains to be seen that Helm- holtz's bold but weakly articulated introduction of an element of "choice" into the discourse of music theory and the cultural practice of composition and other music-making represented a modest but critical conceptual departure. Yet if Helmholtz's aesthetic historiography can indeed be called "liberal progressive," it was also still ensnared in a complex relation to more deter- minist modes of thought. This relation may be diagnosed as typical of mid-nineteenth-century liberalism in its struggle to define some form of nor- mativity for modern culture without enforcing a unisonant discourse of the good. In other words, the liberal progressive ethic motivating a text like Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen can only be captured in recognizing both its emancipatory and its normalizing tendencies, often in the same moment. In nineteenth-century German writings on music theory and aesthetics, of course, extreme examples of organicist rhetoric are hardly difficult to come by. The theorist Louis Kohler, responding to criticism of Hauptmann 's Die Natur der Harmonie und Metrik (1853) , insisted that its author "does no£ want 'to force the capacity for musical expression into the domain of mathematically grounded harmonic tone phenomena'; on the contrary, he does not want any- thing, but rather only wants to represent what harmony itself wants." Kohler offered the example of the root-position triad, containing "already hidden 'in if" the chord's inversion, which "creates 'itself ( 'sich selbst ' macht). Who accomplishes this 're-voicing? Surely no one - it accomplishes itself! . . . A chord, then, can most certainly want something, just like a living creature!" (Kohler 1856, 33-34). 27 To be sure, Kohler embroiders the point about the "will" inherent in musical elements far beyond what Hauptmann himself would have approved. But the rhetoric was commonplace, and subtler variations lace texts as familiar as Hanslick's Vom Musikalisch-Schonen (1854): "All musical elements relate to one another through secret connections and elective affinities ( Wahlver - wandtschaften) , based upon natural laws. These elective affinities . . . live instinctively - though not in the form of scientific consciousness - in every cultivated ear, which accordingly senses through mere intuition the organic and reasonable quality of a collection of tones, or the unreasonable and unnatural quality of the same" (1966, 54) ,28 It would appear that Hanslick is expanding Winterfeld's historiographical trope of melodic or tonal affinity here in the context of a more delimited aesthetic argument. No doubt, given his admiration for Hanslick and approving citation of him at key moments in 27 "Hauptmann will also nicht 'das musikalisch Ausdrucks- vermogen in den Bereich der mathematisch ergrundeten harmonischen Klangphanomene einzwangen' . . . im Gegen- theil, er will gar nichts, sondern nur darthun, was die Har- monie selber will." "Wer hat nun diese 'Verwechslungen' gemacht? doch gewifc niemand - sie macht sich selbst! . . . Ein Accord kann also sehr bestimmt etwas wollen, wie ein lebendiges Geschopf!" Kohler is quoting the composer and critic Joachim Raff (1854, 58). 28 "Alle musikalische Elemente stehen unter sich in geheimen, auf Naturgesetze gegrundeten Verbindungen und Wahlverwandtschaften. Diese den Rhythmus, die Melodie und Harmonie unsichtbar beherrschenden</page><page sequence="16">298 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY the Tonempjindungen , Helmholtz adopted the form of such thinking not only from Winterfeld but also more directly from Hanslick. But the idea of Verwandtschaft took on a different coloring in Hanslick's writing, not least because he extended it with the charged prefix Wahl. This is the critical point at which it becomes necessary to distinguish the attitude of a Hanslick from that of a Helmholtz, as tempting as it has been for some writers to lump them both together as aesthetic "formalists" (for example, Lippman 1992, 304-10). Common to Hanslick and Helmholtz here is the notion that the ratio- nale for tonal affinity - that is, for the intuition that any tone is more' related to some tones than to others - lies beyond the purview of self-present thought while remaining law-like, following an aesthetic-theoretical tradition at least as old as Kant. Just as Hanslick denied the immediate accessibility of tonal Wahl- verwandtschaften to "scientific consciousness" ( wissenschaftliches Bewusstsein) , Helmholtz referred musical decision making to laws that "are not given by conscious reasoning, and are consciously known neither by the artist as he produces the work nor by the . . . listener as he enjoys it" (1896, 589; 1954, 366). 29 Yet Hanslick betrayed a certain ambivalence in his assumption of an irrational force underlying musical relationships in his further refer- ences to tonal Wahlverwandtschaften. To be sure, Hanslick's initial evaluation of the elective affinities tended toward the positive: he approved of these ele- mental relations' potential to "rule melody and harmony invisibly, demand their obedience in human music, and stamp every relationship that contra- dicts them as arbitrariness and ugliness" (64). But the incongruity between Hanslick's oblique and qualified attribution of "choice" to musical elements themselves and his embedding of this positive value in the ear becomes dis- turbingly inverted in a later passage, where he bemoans listeners' corporeal imprisonment at the hands of these same "elective" affinities: This forceful imposition on the nervous system lies not so much in music's artis- tic element, which comes from the spirit and turns toward the spirit, but rather much more in its material , in which that unfathomable physiological elective affinity ( Wahlverwandtschaft) is naturally inborn. It is music's basic elements - sound and motion - which have thrown the unguarded feelings of so many music-lovers in chains, with which they happily clink around. . . . Their engagement with music is not contemplative, but rather pathological (120-21) 30 Wahlverwandtschaften verlangen in der menschlichen Musik ihre Befolgung und stempeln jede ihnen widerspre- chene Verbindung zu Willkur und Haftlichkeit.

Ihr Verhalten gegen die Musik ist nicht anschauend, sondern pathologisch"</page><page sequence="17">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 299 The ambivalent disjunction between Hanslick's two accounts of "elective affin- ity" begs the question of the location of such affinities, as they seem situated at once in the "cultivated ear" ( gebildetes Ohr) and also in music's "material," in its physical potential to excite the body.31 Several complications arise from this. One wonders whether the Bildung that underwrites the "cultivated ear" can be so easily reducible to a crude physiological predisposition. Moreover, what could be the meaning of "electivity" or "choice" at all in this context? Who or what chooses? What is chosen? Within only a few years of the first publication of Hanslick's widely read book, Helmholtz answered the chal- lenge to fathom the physiological depths of the body and to expose the secret of these affinities to scientific consciousness. Yet the most enigmatic feature of elective affinity in Hanslick's account, namely, the prefix Wahl ("election" or "choice"), fell away through the displacement from Hanslick's aesthetic ideol- ogy into Helmholtz's theoretical speculation. Helmholtz never uses the term Wahlverwandtschaften. Yet it should go without saying by now that it is inaccu- rate to attribute the erasure of "electivity" to the impulse of a mechanistically inclined scientist. To appreciate some of the significance of this shift, we might consider some further complex historical connotations of the terms. "Elective affinity" ( affinitas electiva) was originally a technical term in chemistry, where it described interactions among three elements, two of which are bonded when the third enters and compels one of the original pair to break its bond and form a new one of greater mutual attraction. According to Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's Deutsches Worterbuch, Goethe was largely respon- sible for popularizing the term as a symbol of moral relations among people. Die Wahlverwandtschaften , his 1809 novel about marital relations in a love quad- rangle, was undoubtedly the principal vehicle for the term's dissemination into standard usage. Goethe and others were already casually using the term in relatively unmarked contexts by the 1830s, so that it seems to have entered everyday German as a handy way to indicate any relation in which "choice is ascribed to bodies" of otherwise inanimate character (Grimm and Grimm, 1984). This philological narrative of the term in itself suggests some of the conceptual difficulties involved: a concept that originated in natural science in the 1770s was metaphorically transferred to human relations in the 1810s, yet the term itself had already been anthropomorphic from the get-go. "Choice" was thus imposed from the outside on raw chemical elements, whose new-found capacity for choosing then retroscriptively reverted back to the free-willing animal. Ultimately, this disjunctive detour of choice succeeds in qualifying any notion of absolute freedom at all by submerging it in the domain of the unfree only to pull it out again, fundamentally changed in qual- ity. In short, by invoking Goethe's novel, however distantly, Hanslick intro- duced a rather complex discursive construction, in which the qualities of 31 Mark Burford (2006) elaborates the often overlooked multivalence of Hanslick's notion of "material" in connection with the scientific materialism of the 1840s and 1850s.</page><page sequence="18">300 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY objects and their relationships stem partly from the empathetic projection of an observer's own qualities, both physical and moral, onto observed phenom- ena. Yet Hanslick complicates this conceptual figure even further through his ambivalence about the music-theoretical grounds upon which tones might appear to be attracted to some tones more than other tones, since his double-edged Wahlverwandtschaft equivocates over whether this property is to be sought within the physiological subject or in the musical experience produced by that subject. Despite Hanslick's famous rhetoric of free rational imagination, then, the mark of choice is somewhat attenuated. For Walter Benjamin, the extent of choice in Goethe's pivotal concept of "elective affinity" was already ironically compromised through a kind of critique immanent to the concept itself. His 1924 essay on Die Wahlver- wandtschaften pointedly demonstrates how the very idea of Verwandtschaft inev- itably contains an inherent competition for priority between the volitional and the determinate: "Affinity" [ Verwandtschaft ] is already, in and of itself, conceivably the purest word to characterize the closest human connection, as much on the basis of value as on that of motives. . . . This cannot be strengthened through choice; nor, in particular, would the spiritual dimension of such affinity be founded on choice. This rebellious presumption, however, is proved most incontrovertibly by the double meaning of the word "choice" [ Wahl ], which does not cease to signify both what is seized in the act and the very act of choosing. As always, that affin- ity becomes the object of a resolution; it strides over the stage of choice to decision For choice is natural and can even belong to the elements; decision is transcendent. (1996, 346) Although Benjamin's discussion immediately pertains just to the issue of mar- ital relations in Goethe's novel, an important general point about the charac- ter of "affinity" emerges from his analysis. His critique of the metaphor of "elective affinity" implies a distinctive temporality that situates the moment of choosing at once before and after the transcendent decision itself: "before," since the act of choosing self-evidently precedes its result (i.e., "the choice"); and "after," because, insofar as affinity is in itself transcendent, it cannot be preceded by a choice more originary than itself. Although Helmholtz never adopted the term Wahlverwandtschaft, Benja- min's reflections suggest that the doubled notion of choice implied by that otherwise esoteric term might survive vestigially in the apparently innocuous idea of Verwandtschaft itself, contributing to or, indeed, emblematizing the ambiguity of Helmholtz's liberal historiography. If aesthetic (or ethical) choice here is fundamentally interstitial, subsisting between the prior constraints of Verwandtschaft and their subsequent determinations, then tonality itself, which Helmholtz wished to validate as a "freely chosen principle of style," must also sit astride such a doubled moment of aesthetic decision. That is, nobody can autonomously "choose" the tonal relationships suggested by the principle of Verwandtschaft , but in the hiatus between the unconscious sense of affinity and</page><page sequence="19">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 301 the impulse to actualize that affinity (in a tuning system, scalar structure, or composition) sits the interstitial experience of the music-historical subject crudely discernible in Helmholtz's account.32 Interestingly, some part of the structure of this experience is already captured in Dahlhaus's own discussion of Helmholtz, in which he contrasts the models of "natural system" and "history," supposedly characteristic of the harmonic theories of Riemann and Helmholtz, respectively. As Dahlhaus notes, Helmholtz conceived of the relationship between the psychophysiolog- ical aspect of affinity and the "aesthetic principle" of harmonic tonality as a relationship of means to end. That is, "the realization of a 'stylistic principle' . . . depends on rules and means that are 'conditioned by the nature of things,' " in Dahlhaus's words, quoting Helmholtz (Dahlhaus 1990, 60). An aesthetic or moral end can be chosen, and there is no retrospective accounting for that initial choice - particularly as it may not have been made by any specific, real, or contemporary individual - but the subsequent choices made in order to reach that goal are theoretically transparent to reason. Yet, ironically, though it is indeed the subsequent choices that seem most accountable and therefore presumably "free," these decisions are viewed as the most encumbered by some notion of determinism in Helmholtz's think- ing. This is most explicit in the opening passages of part 3 of the Tonempftnd- ungen : "If the goal toward which artists of a particular stylistic tendency strive has been correctly established, along with the principal direction of the path they have adopted to that end, then it can be more or less definitely proved why they had been compelled to follow this or that rule, to embrace this or that technical means" (1896, 387; 1954, 235). 33 Or, to put it in more concrete terms: though the modern major scale cannot be considered a natural prod- uct, it can still be regarded as "the necessary consequence, conditioned by the nature of things, of the chosen stylistic principle" - in other words, of the principle of tonality (1896, 389; 1954, 236). In contrast (according to Dahlhaus's broad strokes), Riemann takes the phenomenon of harmonic tonality as a premise of nature itself, whose logical manifestation can be observed in the various stylistic features associated with triadic harmony in the common practice. Yet, Dahlhaus goes on to suggest that, in fact, this otherwise rather clever distinction between Riemann and Helmholtz may not be entirely meaningful, that these two apparently opposing theoretical conceptions are in practice too closely linked together in the thinking of both theorists to make much difference in the broad scheme of things (1990, 61). 32 An instructive comparison here is with Frangois-Joseph Fetis, whose "transcendental" theory and history of music veered toward a cognitive "nativism" Helmholtz rejected. See Schellhous 1991. 33 "Wenn der Zweck richtig festgestellt ist, dem die Kun- stler einer gewissen Stilart nachstreben, und die Hauptrich- tung des Weges, den sie dazu eingeschlagen haben, so lafct sich ubrigens mehr oder weniger bestimmt nachweisen, warum sie gezwungen waren, diese oder jene Regel zu befolgen, diese oder jenes technische Mittel zu ergreifen."</page><page sequence="20">302 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY But Dahlhaus's late move to identify Riemann's aesthetic naturalism with Helmholtz's comparativism (to use admittedly reductive terms) threatens to efface an important feature of Helmholtz's thought that points strongly in the direction of an underlying liberal ethos missing from Riemann. The par- tial conflation of the two theorists does not acknowledge the specific temporal- ity implicit in Helmholtz's insistence on a radical separation between means and end. (This is ironic since Dahlhaus's own formulation of the distinction so vividly articulates this temporal framework.) For Helmholtz, in contrast to Rameau, Hauptmann, Riemann, and others, it is not that one is presented with natural materials and is compelled from the outset to proceed in a par- ticular fashion along a particular trajectory. Rather, one already has some aes- thetic goal set for oneself, presumably in partial reference to some broader conception of one's musical purposes, before fully coming to terms with the peculiar "natural" properties of tone, and only then does one make the effort to see what decisions might be made given the available materials. It may seem in hindsight, and in comparison with the perceived range of aesthetic options after 1900 or so, that harmonic tonality in the late nine- teenth century was a relatively settled matter with little room for disagree- ment. But at least as a matter of historiography, things were somewhat less clear in the 1860s. For example, in his critique of the Tonempfindungen, Lotze was disturbed by Helmholtz's scrupulous avoidance of the assumption that "tonality" as a unifying principle was an a priori aesthetic requirement. Helm- holtz was willing to tolerate, for example, the possibility that medieval monoph- ony did not exemplify - did not "need" to exemplify - a tonic center that would allow listeners to relate all tones, at all times, to some unitary organiza- tion of their musical perceptions. For Lotze, this possibility could only be considered either dubious or unfortunate. Instead, he argued that, for the sake of unity, every music must attain to some principle of tonality, though not necessarily in the full sense Helmholtz gave to that term. For example, it may not be necessary to have a single tonic pitch as the sole point of departure and return. But it is necessary, Lotze thought, that every tone of a melody is imag- ined not merely in relation to the foregoing and succeeding tones but in rela- tion to some "tone system" as a whole (1868, 470-72). Yet the question of the "necessity" of this characteristic of tonality is precisely what is begged, as Helmholtz realized. The whole area of uncertainty as to what might be meant by tonality, or how one might "apply" it once conceived, was exactly what Helmholtz was committed to exploring, and that is partly what invigorates his prose in the many pages that focus on these issues. While Lotze viewed devia- tion from "our modern musical habituations" as a threat to the coherence and rationality of music, Helmholtz seems to have at least entertained a broader conception of musical "reason" because he tried not to place so many con- straints on the initial choice of aesthetic principle. As Helmholtz's words about the "natural necessity of the chosen stylis- tic principle" make obvious, it is not that he sought to eradicate "necessity"</page><page sequence="21">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 303 completely from the aesthetic discourse, but rather that it was repositioned in relation to a theoretically prior freedom. A prominent point of reference for Helmholtz's formulation of this issue was Mill's logic text, The Logic of the Moral Sciences , the sixth and last part of the longer treatise, A System of Logic (1843), which had been translated into German in the period when Helmholtz was working on musical topics and which he publicly singled out as an exemplary work of humanist scholarship (Helmholtz 1876, 22). 34 Near the beginning of this book, Mill sought to show how the human sciences might maintain confi- dence in the predictability of human behavior, and therefore the integrity of the disciplines of emergent positivist social sciences, without also unduly cur- tailing the idea of free will. "We do not feel ourselves the less free because those to whom we are intimately known are well assured how we shall will to act in a particular case," Mill wrote in a chapter on "Liberty and Necessity." "We may be free, and yet another may have reason to be perfectly certain what use we shall make of our freedom" (1987, 23). Since any action is always in a sense the consequence of some antecedent, and since character traits are themselves kinds of antecedent, then it is fair to say that the ways in which one's character is formed ought to be reckoned among the possible links in a chain of causality. But although character is often formed for rather than by us, this did not rule out the possibility that "we are exactly as capable of mak- ing our own character, if we will , as others are of making it for us." We may not be able to will ourselves to change our character directly, but then nobody can directly will anything of us - they can only will the means toward acting differ- ently, not the end itself (26-27). Mill's preoccupation with a categorical distinction between means and ends as a way of preserving a concept of liberty resurfaced at the end of the book in a chapter titled "Of the Logic of Practice, or Art; including Morality and Policy," thus concluding his magnum opus with a wide-ranging and fairly generalized reflection on aesthetics, morals, and politics. Art was a somewhat foreign topic for a civil servant, liberal philosopher, and logician such as Mill. Typically, he treated it through a metaphor more germane to contemplating the institutions of civil society, characterizing the relationship between art and science as analogous to the relationship between a legislator and judge. In this figure of thought, "Art," whose legislative role takes the form of "pro- posing an end," initiates a process or series that is irreducibly both logical and chronological: The art proposes to itself an end to be attained, defines the end, and hands it over to the science. The science receives it, considers it as a phenomenon or effect to be studied, and having investigated its causes and conditions, sends it back to art with a theorem of the combination of circumstances by which it could be produced. Art then examines these combinations of circumstances, and 34 Helmholtz would have read Mill 1862-1863. There has been considerable wrangling over the extent to which Helm- holtz adopted Mill's methodological prescriptions yet little close comparative reading of the relevant texts.

The only one of the premises, therefore, which Art supplies is the original major premise, which asserts that the attainment of the given end is desirable. Science then lends to Art the proposition (obtained by a series of inductions and deductions) that the performance of certain actions will attain the end. From these premises Art concludes that the performance of these actions is desirable, and finding it also practicable, converts the theorem into a rule or precept. (135-36) Mill is thus describing, however abstractly, a process of aesthetic theory forma- tion. The process begins with a moment of relative openness, as the initial choice of end appears free of the constraining antecedents that accumulate in the subsequent series of negotiations over means. Critically, the "judicial" phases of this process do not entail a judgment on the Tightness, quality, or value of the "legislatively" willed end, only on its attainability. Indeed, the whole point of Mill's discussion seems to be to protect the initial choice from the logical narrowing that might follow from subsequent deliberation (without, critically, thereby forfeiting the prerogative to revise an initial choice). Mill's segregation of the process into two broad moments of decision, legislative and judicial, provides an important conceptual foundation for what might be retrospectively identified as a liberal theory of aesthetics. Choice and causality, subsisting in two separate moments of a process (rather than fight- ing for false hierarchical supremacy within a single "system"), are made both distinct and compatible. Admittedly, given the abstraction of Mill's writing, it is somewhat unclear how to imagine this process unfolding in a more concrete context. Yet I would suggest that Helmholtz, just as keen as Mill to reconcile some notion of causal- ity in one sphere with aesthetic and ethical "freedom" in another, carries out Mill's basic arguments in a musical context in part 3 of the Tonempfindungen. Thus, Helmholtz maintains that, although aesthetic principles may change, "it does not follow from this that the choice of those elements of musical art was purely arbitrary, and that they do not allow of being derived from some more general law. On the contrary, the rules of any style of art form a well-connected system whenever that style has attained a full and perfect development" (1896, 386-76; 1954, 235). 35 And his declaration that, once the end has been estab- lished, one might predict the "principal direction of the path" one would need to follow to achieve that end, follows directly from Mill's conception of humanistic logic described above. In other words, having chosen some musi- cal value or desideratum such as tonic centricity, and given the peculiar prop- erties of musical tones or Klange (whether intuited or rigorously observed), 35 "Daraus folgt nun noch nicht, dass die Wahl der genannten Elemente musikalischer Technik rein willkurlich sei, und sie keine Ableitung aus einem allgemeineren Gesetze zuliessen. Im Gegentheil, die Regeln eines jeden Kunststils bilden ein wohl zusammenhangendes System, wenn derselbe uberhaupt zu einer reichen und vollendeten Entwickelung gekommen ist."</page><page sequence="23">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 305 one might rationally predict the best means of realizing it. Such means, Helmholtz's broader discussion implies, would ultimately include the wide range of harmonic resources that make up "modern" harmonic tonality. But, to recall our earlier discussion of Lotze, Helmholtz remained careful not to constrain the assumption of any particular initial aesthetic desideratum, the role of "general law" entering only after the initial choice. Subsequent, more locally determined choices of "aesthetic principle" might be made and might even "allow of being derived from some more general law," but this ostensibly lawlike derivation need not in itself amount to the purely deterministic image of music theory usually associated with Helmholtz. In general, then, Helmholtz's insistence on the compatibility of "choice" ( Wahl ) and "lawful- ness" owes much to Mill's demonstration of the compatibility of "volition" and "causation": actions can be simultaneously chosen and caused since "causa- tion" does not entail "compulsion" or "necessity" but only "predictability." But beyond this, and again in harmony with Mill's abbreviated theory of aesthetic logic, Helmholtz maintained the possibility of some fundamental prior choice (however obscure in its historical manifestation) that did not require refer- ence to a binding logical antecedent. I want to suggest in concluding that Mill's and Helmholtz's common impulse to reconcile causality and choice not by mediating between them but instead, paradoxically, by requiring their strict conceptual (and temporal) separation is symptomatic of a broader tradition of liberal thought. As the polit- ical philosopher Will Kymlicka suggests, liberal society not only requires the defense of the freedom to pursue the good life, but is rather more specifically concerned with "the forming and revising of people's conceptions of the good, rather than the pursuit of those conceptions once chosen" (1995, 82). Kymlicka's attentiveness to a second moment of decision, the possibility of revision, would seem to remove his assessment some distance from the aes- thetic logic elaborated by Helmholtz and Mill. These latter writers might be read as prioritizing the leeway granted to the initial choice of "end" or "stylistic principle." But the more essential point lies in seeing the doubleness of choos- ing and the strange experience of disjunction and interstitiality it entails. Commenting on the trajectory of liberal thought from Mill to Kymlicka, Homi Bhabha locates such a disjunct temporality of choice at the midpoint of liberal discourse generally. "The liberal conception of the good," Bhabha writes, requires that the originary, first act of choosing has to be supplemented by a second deliberative choice, a kind of doubling the stakes of choice, if you will. It is worth noticing that this liberal notion of choice is grounded in an iterative or supplementary logic: deliberative cultural choice only "knows" its freedom retro- actively, once the revisionary choice has been made. So the freedom attributed to choice, within the liberal discourse, and to the autonomous subject that sub- tends it, is realized in a time-lag that exists in-between the supplementary sequence of choices. (2000, 182-83)</page><page sequence="24">306 JOURNAL of MUSIC THEORY Bhabha's description of a "time lag" is disorienting partly because of the way it suddenly throws day-to-day ethical haggling in relief against normally forgot- ten prior moments of decision about broader aims. Yet it also suggestively diagnoses the way in which cultural choice in liberal society often moves out- side the scope of the singular "deliberative choice" to embrace forms of deci- sion making that can seem more unaccountable, because of either historical distance from such decisions (recall Lotze's point about the inertia of received cultural values and his related skepticism about historical "progress") or their inaccessibility to collective political consciousness, but in any case because an ethical or aesthetic choice has not been fully recognized as such until the moment of its revision. Such a time lag - between some initial condition of cultural belonging and the belated recognitions that either actualize or revise a presupposed cultural aim - might be taken quite precisely to situate Helmholtz's account of the historical formation of musical discourse. In other words, the foregoing discussion has sought to discern in Helmholtz's historicist aesthetics an odd disjunctive temporality amid the developmentalist narrative of modern tonal- ity's slow historical evolution. And that particular tendency toward disjunction aligns this account with a broad pattern of classical liberal discourse in the Millian tradition. Yet this elusive "temporality" - partly historical, partly dis- cursive (though not straightforwardly phenomenal or phenomenological) - perhaps becomes clearest only in comparison with other texts (Lotze's, for example, or Riemann's), where no role for the deferred negotiation over an initial choice of music-aesthetic principles is evident. The doubled stakes of cultural choice Bhabha describes should, one might add, be strictly distin- guished from the rather different "doubling" of choice that Benjamin per- ceived in the ironic o verde terminations of "elective affinity." There, the tran- scendence of the original "choice" had all but overwhelmed any possibility of secondary revision (encouraging the unexpectedly ambivalent evaluations of tonal-theoretical reason in writers like Hanslick) . And yet, as we have seen, even in opening up a rhetorical space for the embrace of aesthetic choice, however complex in conceptual structure, Helm- holtz by no means abandons a familiar restrictive narrative privileging Ger- man Protestant music as the consistent bellwether of cultural "progress." It is only fair, then, to close with some brief remarks proposing a possible response to the uncertain position of Helmholtzian music theory between a relatively "open" humanism and a deterministic scientism. Given his otherwise rather remarkable liberal rhetoric, it would be natural to regard Helmholtz's reten- tion of a typically Eurocentric, and ultimately racist, historiography as hypo- critical or two-faced: music that fell outside the narrow space of harmonic tonality he regarded as pursuing only "more limited tasks" (beschranktere Auf- gaben). And certainly it must be said that his attitude in passages on non- Western music perpetuates the tendency of colonial discourses to see space for time and geography for history: Helmholtz situates these "more limited"</page><page sequence="25">Benjamin Steege ~ Helmholtz, Music Theory, and Liberal-Progressive History 307 musics "beside and before" (neben und vor) the nominal modernity of har- monic tonality, thus locating non-European culture at a distinct remove from his own historical moment (1896, 410; 1954, 249). 36 The rhetoric of progress, which inevitably accompanied the rhetoric of liberalism in the heydays of nineteenth-century industrialization and colonialism, again draws Mill's and Helmholtz 's projects together in this regard. Mill held the influential post of Examiner of Indian Correspondence for the East India Company from 1836 to 1858 (the bulk of his career), and from that high colonialist vantage point saw fit to justify liberty of thought, speech, and action in "civil society" in the same breath in which he supposed it impractical and impossible in the "backward states of society" he was administering.37 By doing so, he put in question not only his commitment to his most famous cause but also the very legitimacy of the authority from which he wrote and administered. In this regard, the critical move of the liberalism Mill and Helmholtz articulated was to dispense with the notion of natural historical progress without sacrificing their attachment to the notion of rational historical progress, to which certain groups had privileged access. Both concepts of progress are undoubtedly meant, at least in part, to underwrite a race-hierarchical vision of the world. Yet, as Bhabha has argued, to accuse figures like Mill of duplicity is inap- propriately "to moralize both the intention of writing and the object of gov- ernment." It is to misread the wider context in which the liberal discourse of this period was inscribed. For Mill, that context included a requirement to authorize empire by displacing its (il) liberalism onto the subcontinental other ("to address the other as despot," as Bhabha ambiguously writes). For Helmholtz, by roughly parallel logic, the liberal discursive context included a requirement to authorize an ostensibly empiricist music history and psychol- ogy by displacing the determinism of his own physiologizing narrative onto the "more limited" cultures that were held to obey a lesser reason, which was in fact nothing other than the writer's own. Thus, it is not so much a dubious duplicity as a "specific discursive doubleness" that structures Helmholtz 's com- plex and ambivalent writing between the identification with the liberal (or "humanist") and the mechanical (Bhabha 1994, 136, 139). This awkward position in between discursive moments often falls out on the surface of Helmholtz's texts simply as a commonplace disciplinary distinc- tion between art and science, which has been recognized often enough, though most full-throatedly by Dahlhaus, as a hallmark of his work. Yet one implication of the foregoing discussion is that the idea of disciplinary "separa- tion" perhaps unduly spatializes a mode of thought that was at its core both historical and also, perhaps more consequential, formed within a complex disjunctive temporal logic well beyond what is normally meant by "historicist" thought. Indeed, such thinking is perhaps much tess familiar today than might 36 On the "conjuring trick" and "array of devices that have the common intent and function to keep the Other outside the Time of anthropology," see Fabian 1983, xi. 37 The key text here is, of course, Mill 1978.

Thus, the two incommen- surable modes of knowledge most characteristic of Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen - history and psychophysiology - do not simply coexist but rather compete at every moment for an impossible (chrono) logical priority, and this structural impossibility does not so much undermine but indeed intensifies the explanatory zeal of each. 38 "Die Musik . . . ist historisch die erste und alteste eigen- tliche Kunst . . . , weil sie es physiologisch und psycholo- gisch ist."
