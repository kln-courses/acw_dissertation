<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 15 Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3,  central-western Arnhem Land:  Determining the age of the so-called  ‘Genyornis ’ painting Bryce Barker, Lara Lamb, Jean-Jacques Delannoy, Bruno David,  Robert Gunn, Emilie Chalmin, Géraldine Castets, Ken Aplin,  Benjamin Sadier, Ian Moffat, Jerome Mialanes, Margaret Katherine,  Jean-Michel Geneste and Stéphane Hoerlé Introduction In 2011, Gunn et al. published the discovery in a remote part of the western Arnhem Land  plateau of a rock painting that closely resembles the most recent reconstructions of an extinct  megafaunal bird, the dromornithid Genyornis newtoni. Characteristics of the painting distinguish  it from depictions of other bird species and support its identification as G. newtoni: a deep  convex bill, unlike the shallow bill of an emu or cassowary; a globular cranium and relatively  thick neck; indication of a crop (emus and cassowaries lack crops); non-pendulous posture of  the wing (unlike the pendulous posture of emus); the proportions of the pelvic limb showing  long tibiotarsi and stout tarsometatarsi; the short, broad toes that appear to terminate in blunt  claws; and a dorsal profile paralleling that of reconstructed dromornithids and unlike an emu  or any species of cassowary, in which the vertex of the back is more anterior. The several points  of special resemblance between the painting and reconstructions of the extinct bird based on  paleontological evidence led Gunn et al. (2011:10) to conclude, ‘on the basis of probability the  painting is indeed a representation of Genyornis newtoni’. This finding brings a conundrum. If the painting is indeed a contemporaneous depiction of  G. newtoni, it becomes the oldest painting known in the world, for the bird is thought to have  become extinct around 50,000 ± 5000 years ago (Miller et al. 1999; Roberts and Brook 2010;  Roberts et al. 2001) or even earlier (see Grellet-Tinner et al. 2016). Or that timing for the  extinction of Genyornis is wrong; or a relic population survived longer on the Arnhem Land  plateau (e.g. Murray and Vickers-Rich 2004), perhaps until the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),  which commenced around 25,000 years ago. And, as Gunn et al. (2011) acknowledged, there  are still other alternatives. The painting might be of a ‘mythological’ animal: either one rooted in  ancient memory of G. newtoni, as has been suggested for the ‘mihirung’ of southern Australian  Aboriginal peoples (Vickers-Rich 1987) – although in societies without writing, social memory  </page> <page sequence="2"> 424    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia has not been found anywhere in the world to reliably extend in recognisable form over very  long periods of time (cf. Bradley 2002) – or of a creature without a material counterpart that  fortuitously resembled the fossil bird.  The painting occurs on a vertical rock wall under a shallow overhang. Could the motif really have  survived there since Pleistocene times, whether 25,000 or 50,000 years ago? And the painting  shows a speared bird, so it could be the first evidence for the hunting of extinct megafauna in  Australia. With these enigmas in mind, the Jawoyn Association asked us in 2010 to study the ‘Genyornis’  site, to investigate the age of the art and its archaeological and geomorphological context. Our  major aims were to ask whether the painting dates, or theoretically could date, to the time  of G. newtoni, or whether it must be more recent, and to uncover contextual ancient cultural  information relating to the artworks and to occupation activities at the site in the past. Here,  we present the results of these archaeological and geomorphological investigations along with  a summary of the chemistry of the rock surface that houses the painting of the large bird thought  by Gunn et al. (2011) to be of a Genyornis. Genyornis newtoni Genyornis newtoni (henceforth, just Genyornis) was the last known member of the endemic and  extinct Australian bird family Dromornithidae. Although they have long been considered to  be ‘ratites’ with likely affinities to emus and cassowaries, recent studies of the cranium suggest  that dromornithids are more closely related to ducks, geese and screamers (members of the  Order Anseriformes); they may be related specifically to another Australian endemic, the magpie  goose (Anseranas semipalmata) (Murray and Megirian 1998), so characteristic of Arnhem Land  wetlands today. Whatever its affinities, the Dromornithidae is an ancient family that attained  its highest diversity more than 10 million years ago. Since that time, various branches of the  Dromornithidae petered out, with Genyornis alone known to have survived into the Pleistocene. The final extinction of Genyornis, the last of the dromornithids, is generally treated as part of a late  Pleistocene megafaunal extinction ‘event’, which saw the demise of numerous large Australian  vertebrate species, including many large marsupials and some reptiles (Roberts and Brook 2010;  Roberts et al. 2001). Only a select few, Genyornis among them, are confirmed as having survived  long enough to have co-existed with humans following the colonisation of Australia around  65,000 years ago (Miller et al. 1999; Roberts et al. 2001). Yet, even for these, the nature of  the human–megafauna interaction and the causes and consequences of the extinctions remain  shrouded in uncertainty. What exactly do we know about Genyornis? And what do we know about the time and cause  of its extinction?  The anatomy of Genyornis is quite well known from discoveries of almost complete skeletons.  These indicate a bird only slightly taller than a modern emu (Dromaius novehollandiae) but of  a much stockier build – estimates of adult body weights range between 220 and 275 kg, compared  with 40–50 kg for the emu (see Murray and Vickers-Rich 2004 for a fossil reconstruction of  Genyornis newtoni). Such a bulky bird was long portrayed as slow moving, but recent studies  of the limb skeleton suggest that it was capable of reaching speeds similar to those of the emu  (Murray and Vickers-Rich 2004). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    425  Surviving fragments of the skull suggest a globular cranium with a short, heavily constructed beak  (Murray and Megirian 1998). Although the massive beak has been interpreted by some as a sign  of a carnivorous diet, other evidence, including gizzard stones in association with some skeletons,  and the structure of the beak and feet all favour a herbivorous diet (Murray and Vickers-Rich  2004; Rich 1979).  Recent interpretations of both the distribution of Genyornis and of the timing of its extinction  rest heavily on the attribution to this species (most likely erroneously, see below) of a distinctive  and sometimes very abundant kind of fossil eggshell. This association was first made by Williams  (1981), who distinguished two morphological kinds of eggshell from sites of late Pleistocene age  in South Australia. Both kinds of eggshell were from eggs about the same size as those laid by  the living emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), but while some fragments had features consistent to  those of modern emu, others showed differences in surface ornamentation and the arrangement  of pores (Williams 1981). When eggshell of this ‘Genyornis’ type was mapped together with  skeletal remains, the species appeared to be widely distributed across the Murray-Darling system  of southeast Australia, the internally draining Lake Eyre and Lake Frome Basins of south-central  Australia, and in the southwest corner of Western Australia. No skeletal remains or eggshell of  the ‘Genyornis’ type has been reported from anywhere in northern Australia. However, it is worth  noting that there are still relatively few Pleistocene fossil sites in this area and even fewer that have  yielded remains of megafauna. The few sites that might have been expected to produce remains of  Genyornis (but in each case have not) include the Quanbun site in the south Kimberley (Flannery  1984) and the alluvial terraces along the Leichhardt and Gregory rivers in the Gulf region of  Queensland (Archer et al. 2006).  Eggshell, by virtue of its crystalline structure and organic content, is an ideal material for amino  acid racimisation, radiometric dating and also for chemical analysis of dietary preferences.  For these reasons, the ancient eggshell record from northern South Australia and surrounding  regions was targeted for detailed studies by Miller and his co-researchers. Their studies showed  that the two kinds of eggshell were deposited in the many sand dunes and beaches, more or less  continuously from around 140,000 years ago until around 45,000–50,000 years ago, after which  the Dromaius kind alone was deposited (Miller et al. 1999).  Miller et al. (2005) took their investigations one step further through dietary analysis of eggshell  samples. The results indicated that the regional emu population had a less restricted dietary range  than contemporaneous populations of the second, extinct species. Whereas the emu samples  show highly variable chemical signatures that indicate a capacity to feed on a wide variety of  plant foods including shrubs and trees as well as all kinds of grasses, the extinct species showed  a narrower diet with a likely reliance on more nutritious grasses.  The study by Miller et al. (2005) was widely touted as compelling evidence for the regional  (and  even continental) extinction of Genyornis at 45,000–50,000 years ago, and the dietary  analysis provided a plausible mechanism whereby the arrival of humans led to a change in the  firing regime and changes in vegetation communities that caused the decline to extinction of a less  adaptable species. Rare occurrences of burnt eggshell of the ‘Genyornis’ kind further indicated  a  brief period of regional overlap between humans and the extinct species and of predation  (at least of nests) that might have hastened their decline (Magee and Miller 2007).  A new study by Grellet-Tinner et al. (2016) has seriously undermined this textbook example of  how to study megafaunal extinction. By using a better preserved and more complete example  of a ‘Genyornis’ egg, and consideration of both its size and micro-structure in comparison with  eggshell attributed to other species of dromornithids from Oligo-Miocene fossil sites, the authors  conclude that the second kind of eggshell studied by Williams (1981) and Miller et al. (1999,  2005) is not from Genyornis at all but from a different kind of bird, most likely a species of the  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="4"> 426    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia genus Progura: large, extinct megapodes or mound-builders of which two species are recorded  from late Pleistocene Australia (Grellet-Tinner et al. 2016). This change in taxonomic assignment  aside, all of the other conclusions and interpretations made by Miller et al. (1999, 2005) and  Magee and Miller (2007) remain valid, albeit now relevant to a different species.  Once the eggshell record is removed from consideration, there is very little evidence regarding the  timing and cause of extinction of Genyornis. As Grellet-Tinner et al. (2016) point out, skeletal  remains of Genyornis are remarkably rare and most records are from contexts demonstrably  older than 100,000 years old. One controversial claim for later survival comes from the site of  Cuddie Springs in western New South Wales, where radiocarbon dating of enclosing sediments  suggests the survival of Genyornis until after 30,000 BP (Field and Boles 1998; Trueman et al.  2005). However, direct dating of the bones of Genyornis and other megafauna there indicates  that the megafauna may all have reworked from underlying, much older sediments (Grün et  al. 2010; Roberts and Brook 2010). An interesting irony derived from Grellet-Tinner et al.’s  (2016) reinterpretation of the Lake Eyre Basin eggshell record is that Genyornis may actually have  contributed no eggshell throughout the period 140,000–45,000 years ago, which might actually  be the best evidence for its regional extinction prior to the penultimate interglacial. However,  this possibility will need careful study of the large numbers of samples from the many sites across  the region. Murray and Vickers-Rich (2004) postulated that Genyornis may have survived longer in parts of  Australia that acted as refugia during the climatic extreme of the LGM, seeing the rugged Arnhem  Land escarpment as a potential refugium. This suggestion hinges on three principal assumptions:  Genyornis actually occurred in the tropical north of Australia; its demise elsewhere was principally  driven by climatic factors; and the environment of Arnhem Land during the late Pleistocene  favoured its survival. This scenario also has two interesting corollaries: unless populations of  Genyornis in each refugium fell below viable levels before the end of harsh conditions, it should  have expanded out of its LGM refugia following climatic amelioration; and any extinction of  Genyornis subsequent to climatic amelioration should have occurred for non-climatic factors,  with human predation being a likely cause. The possible painting of Genyornis is the only direct evidence to support the refugia hypothesis;  the acidic soils of Arnhem Land are not good for the preservation potential of Genyornis bone  and eggshell. However, two other lines of evidence encourage the notion. A recent study of  emu DNA, using the methods of phylogeography (Thomson 2012), found evidence for major  declines in emu populations on several occasions through the late Pleistocene, and a geographic  patterning of modern genetic variation consistent with contraction into refugia. And estimates of  the timing of the contractions align well with periods of extreme climatic conditions. Evidently,  even the more adaptable emu suffered local population declines during the harshest conditions  of the late Pleistocene. Genyornis, with its more specialised diet, may have suffered more, perhaps  including regional extinction across large parts of its former range.  Another line of evidence concerns the modern distribution within Australia of clearly relictual  species that today are restricted to small geographic areas (and usually to very specific habitats)  but which fossil evidence shows to have been more widely distributed in the past. The Australian  vertebrate fauna contain numerous examples of relictual species and many of these occur in the  tropical north of Australia, typically in association with vegetation that contains many floristic  elements derived from ancient Australian rainforests. A textbook example from Arnhem Land  is the rock-haunting ringtail possum (Petropseudes dahli) – a species that belongs to an ancient  evolutionary lineage that was widespread across Australia in the Miocene (Archer et al. 2006)  but which today is otherwise represented in the modern rainforest faunas of the Queensland  Wet Tropics and New Guinea. Other examples from the Queensland Wet Tropics include the  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="5"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    427  green ringtail possum (Pseudochirops archeri), the Herbert River ringtail possum (Pseudochirulus  herbertensis), the musky rat kangaroo (Hypsiprymnodon moschatus) and the doubled-wattled  cassowary (Casuarius casuarius). An example from the Kimberley region of northwest Australia  is the scaly-tailed possum (Wyulda squamicauda), whose closest known relatives are fossil species  from the Miocene of Queensland (Archer et al. 2006). Each of these species represents an  example of local to regional survival of an evolutionary lineage for periods of many millennia  to millions of years after the regional extinction of the same or related species in other parts of  Australia. In each case, the key factor that most likely underpinned the survival was the greater  environmental stability within these sheltered and moist habitats, compared with surrounding  areas. However, a lack of human predation is undoubtedly also important within the period since  human settlement of Australia, especially for any larger species. JSARN–124 site 3 The archaeological site thought by Gunn et al. (2011) to contain the painting of a Genyornis bird  was given the survey identification number JSARN–124 site 3 by the Jawoyn Association. As one  of the key aims of this chapter is to determine through archaeological, geomorphological and  chemical evidence whether or not the painting can possibly be of a Genyornis bird, so as to not  preconfigure the result we refer to the site with its original survey site number, JSARN–124 site  3, and to the previously called ‘Genyornis’ motif as ‘the large bird motif ’. Geologically, the site is located on the Arnhem Land plateau at the contact zone of a low rise of  Marlgowa Sandstone (of the Kombolgie Subgroup, Katherine River Group) that formed during  the Protezoroic 1740–1780 million years ago, and a broad depression drained by a tributary of  the upper reaches of the Katherine River (Figure 1.1). Within the overall depression, the bedrock  is buried by a shallow layer of aeolian sands eroded from quartzitic sandstone benches. At a broad, landscape scale, the contact zone between the low rise and the depression is today  marked by a network of isolated rock stacks (Figure 15.1). These rock stacks represent the ancient  edge of the low rise and are of uneven orientations, signalling their fragmentation through  chemical and mechanical weathering and gravitational collapse (e.g. roof-fall). JSARN–124 site  3 is one of these rock stacks. The first people onto this landscape, between 65,000 and c. 50,000  years ago, entered a geological landscape that was very similar to the one visible today.  The JSARN–124 site 3 rock stack consists of superimposed quartzite strata measuring some  4.5 m thick × 11 m long × 7 m wide, sitting on and overhanging a narrow quartzite pedestal  2.5 m long × 6 m wide. The pedestal represented by rock strata D2–D1–D0 is narrower than  the overlying, overhanging strata D3–D7 (see Figures 15.2 and 15.3). This is due to the pedestal  having lower resistance to forces of erosion than the overlying strata. As a result of the narrowness  of the pedestal, the overlying strata have tilted northward. This tilting, along with the collapse  of large parts of the overhang, took place over a long, geological time frame sometime before the  arrival of people in the landscape. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="6"> 428    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 15.1 JSARN–124 site 3 (bottom right-hand rock stack), excavation of Squares B and D in progress.

This flat northern face is the scar  left by the collapse of what had been a much deeper overhang than the current one. The boulders  that are now at ground level immediately to the north of the shallow remnant overhang are the  fallen sections of strata D4–D5–D6 that previously made up the ‘original’ overhang (see below  for further details). The rock art Rock art is found on five panels (Panels A–E) around the quartzitic sandstone stack  (see Figure 15.3). Each panel is described separately below. Panel A Panel A faces slightly east of north. It is 5 m long × 3 m high, and is today protected by a shallow,  1.5 m deep overhang. As noted above, previously the overhang was considerably larger than it is  now, as indicated by massive rock collapse beyond the present dripline (Figure 15.4; see below).  Parts of Panel A have been subject to water-wash, which accounts for the variability of colour and  partial erasure of images on the eastern side of the panel. Figure 15.4 Location of art Panel A. Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. Panel A contains 29 images in monochrome reds or yellows (Figures 15.5 and 15.6). It is  dominated by a large painting of a bird (Image #5), 1.66 m long × 1.07 m high – the one that  might show Genyornis. Gunn et al. (2011) provide a detailed description of the panel, although  an extra motif (Image #29) has now been identified, and Image #14 is reclassified here as a large  macropod whose hind quarters and tail have been destroyed by weathering.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 15.

The large bird motif post-dates a series of hand stencils including the 3MF (for three middle  fingers together, with the thumb and small finger to one side) type generally associated with  Chaloupka’s Dynamic Figures style, which researchers provisionally think dates to around  10,000–12,000 years ago (Chippindale and Taçon 1998; Taçon and Brockwell 1995; but see  Chaloupka 1993 who thought they may have been older; see Chapter 1). The large bird motif  on Panel A overlies both hand stencil Image #19 and the 3MF hand stencil (Image #20), so it  is younger (Table 15.1). In the initial recording, the large bird painting was thought to underlie  at least four other images (Gunn et al. 2011), while the large, solid male figure (Image #6) was  thought as overlying the large bird motif. We have since shown elsewhere that Image #6 underlies  the large bird motif and is therefore older (Chalmin et al. 2017). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="10"> 432    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Table 15.1 Panel A: Simplified superimposition sequence involving the earliest and latest images  (most recent image at top of table; earliest at bottom).

Furthermore, the paint layer from the spear merges in  cross-section with that of the large bird motif (Image #5), and so the two are therefore probably contemporaneous. Source: Authors’ data. Other recognisable images include a female macropod with joey, two flying-foxes, a unimarginal  barbed spear, and two unidentified faunal taxa (a quadruped and a waterbird). As with the early  suite of red hand stencils, the yellow images (Images #11, #12, #13, #14 and #29) appear to be  a contemporaneous group. The painting of the spear (Image #9) intersects  the painting of ‘Genyornis’ (Image #5) in  a composition that implies a deliberate  association (Figure 15.7). One interpretation  of this composition could be of a speared  bird, although in Arnhem Land the vertical  upwards orientation of the spear is unusual  for so-called ‘hunting scenes’. However, the  hunting theme is of particular interest because  if the bird is indeed of Genyornis, and if the  spear is contemporaneous with the Genyornis  painting, then it would suggest that the bird  was hunted.  The shape of the spear (Image #9) on the  large bird motif corresponds with Chaloupka’s  bokko spears, for which he does not offer an  age but notes, ‘the stone country people such  as the Badmardi clan claim it as their own’  (1993:148); that is, according to some recent  oral traditions, it originated on the Arnhem  Land plateau, although it was also then used on  the low-lying plains.

Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    433  The waterbird (Image #10) has a well-delineated but unpainted interior. Brandl (1972:27)  sees such ‘empty’ interiors as a precursor to the development of X-ray features. Taçon suggests  ‘the approximate upper age limit for the early x-ray period has been placed at 8000–6000 years  BP’ (1989:119), but further notes, ‘in a sense, however, the upper age should remain open-ended  as some aspect of ‘internalness’ has been found in earlier styles’ (Taçon 1989:119; see also Taçon  1992:203). Subsequently, Chaloupka tentatively suggested that this convention of hollow body  began towards the beginning of his Estuarine Period, around 8000 years ago. None of these  suggested ages are based on any direct dating of art (Chaloupka 1993:183–185). The large bird  motif is also hollow-bodied: did this artistic convention begin long before the early Holocene,  prior to the LGM (see Gunn et al. 2011)? Panel B Panel B is on the rear wall of the alcove behind excavation Square A (Figures 15.8–15.10).  The rock panel measures 2.3 × 0.7 m, but the irregular southern half is undecorated. Small areas  of the panel have been damaged by exfoliation and the lower margin of the southern half has  been extensively flaked.  The 12 images on the panel are all in monochrome red and very poorly preserved. The only  recognisable images are of a solid macropod (Image #33), a goose-like bird (Image #31), a pair  of macropod tracks (Image #40) and a cluster of drawn lines (Image #41). The macropod  (66 cm long; height indeterminate) is the largest image on the panel. Image #33 is superimposed  over Images #34, #35 and #37, but the sequential relationship of the other images cannot be  determined due to their poor preservation. Figure 15.8 Location of Panel B.

Although not specifically identified to species during those discussions,  the bush hen (Amaurornis olivaceus) is a type of rail that frequents swamp forests and is recorded  from the region (Pizzey and Knight 1997:148). An alternative identification is the jirrirti (brown  quail; Coturnix ypsilophora), a character of Jawoyn oral traditions that is represented in a similar  manner to the bush hen (Wynjorroc et al. 2001:36). This form of bird depiction, as determined  by the general shape of paintings, is one of the most commonly represented birds in the early art  of the plateau, often shown in linear groups of six or more. The ‘empty’ body cavity in Image #45  is stylistically similar to that of the unidentified waterbird on Panel A (Image #10).  The bandicoot Image #49 is recognised by its short, straight tail, prominent testicles, short hind  legs and two prominent macropod-like toes on the hind foot. Bandicoots are also common in  early Jawoyn rock art on the plateau. All of the images on this panel are badly weathered and, while the beak of the left bush hen/ brown quail has been destroyed by exfoliation, water-wash has been responsible for most of the  erasures elsewhere.  Studies at the nearby site of Nawarla Gabarnmang (Gunn et al. 2011) suggest that most images  painted with white pigment are less than 400 years old. If the Nawarla Gabarnmang situation  signals a broader pattern for Jawoyn Country, the two white images on Panel C at JSARN–124  site 3 (Images #47 and #48) would be of a similarly recent age. Panel D A very weathered rock face, Panel D measures 2.0 × 0.6 m in size and contains six red paintings,  all in very poor condition (Figures 15.14–15.16). It is possible that the panel was once decorated  more extensively, but no traces of other images now remain. The panel is directly behind  excavation Square D. Patterns of superimposition indicate that the surviving images were painted  in three groups: • An early group consisting of a single striped fragment of an originally larger image (Image #52). • A middle group of three linear images including a pair of back-to-back anthropomorphs  (Images #50 and #51). • A later group of an anthropomorph (Image #54) and a crooked line (Image #53).

The panel is partially hidden by the rockfall from Panel A and is most readily  photographed obliquely (Figure 15.17). The panel is approximately 2.0 m long × 0.8 m high; it  contains five images in two layers of superimposition (Figures 15.18 and 15.19). The underlying  image consists of a poorly preserved hand stencil (Image #57), while the overlying images consist  of a macropod (Image #56), a goanna (Image #58) and a bandicoot (Image #60). The other  image, Image #59, is a poorly preserved fragment of an originally larger outline image. The images  are made at a similar scale to those on the smaller Panels B–D. The bandicoot (Image #60) on  Panel E is similar in form and pose to the bandicoot on Panel D (Image #49). Their similarity of  representation suggests that the two are probably contemporaneous. The hand stencil (Image #57)  is in a similarly poor state of preservation as those on Panel A, and may thus be contemporaneous  with them, as both sets of hand stencils occur as the earliest images on their respective panels.

Discussion of the art JSARN–124 site 3 contains one large and four smaller art panels with a total of 60 images  painted or stencilled in monochrome red, yellow or white. Regionally, this is a medium-sized  art site. Patterns of superimposition show the earliest images appear to be the hand stencils,  including of the 3MF type, on Panels A and E, while the most recent artworks are likely to be  the remnant white images on Panel C. If 3MF hand stencils are around 10,000–12,000 years old  and the bird is Genyornis, then something seems amiss: either the 3MF type of stencil is much  older than currently thought, or Genyornis survived long after the LGM. Geochemical analyses To determine if the large bird motif could have survived on a relatively exposed rock surface since  late Pleistocene times, chemical analyses were carried out on the micro-stratigraphy (including  on-wall pigments) at a number of rock art panels. Very small fragments of the rock surface  were sampled, in each case with a new scalpel blade and stored in individual phials (Table 15.2;  e.g. Figure 15.20). In the laboratory, the colour, size, shape and texture of each sample were  recorded prior to undertaking more detailed chemical analyses. The individual samples from  painted or stencilled surfaces were then compared with surface wall samples devoid of pigment  and with bulk bedrock samples. Some of the samples were embedded in epoxy resin in order to  examine micro-stratigraphic relationships between the underlying rock, paint layer(s) and surface  crusts. Details of these analyses have been presented in Chalmin et al. (2017). Table 15.2 Description of samples from JSARN–124 site 3.

In each case, these consist of 1) an underlying large white opaque or  translucent matrix, superimposed by 2) a thin red or yellow layer of paint pigment (e.g. Figures  15.21 and 15.22). Three samples (GN1-2, GN1-5 and GN1-6) each exhibit an additional outer  (surface) crust layer that entirely or partially covers and protects the paint layer.  The cross-section of sample GN1-4, originating from the intersection of Images #6 and #9,  reveals a succession of 1) an underlying white matrix, covered by 2) a discontinuous yellowish  layer, superimposed by 3) a layer of light red, itself superimposed by 4) a thin layer of dark red of  similar thickness to the light red layer below it.

The underlying rock matrix In each sample, the relatively thick white rock matrix that underlies the layer of paint is mainly  opaque and can include more or less large translucent crystals of quartz 100–500 μm long.  The presence of quartz is confirmed by the chemical composition of the crystals (SiO2) and by  their structure as revealed by both Raman micro-spectroscopy and XRD. The nature of the white  opaque matrix is more difficult to identify due to its weak crystallinity. SEM-EDX chemical  mapping across several cross-sections reveals an extensive matrix containing mainly Al, P and  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="20"> 442    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia K, with minor Na and Mg, in which are found small crystals of SiO2 (&lt;50 μm long), TiO2  (c. 10 μm long) and CaSO4 (c. 10 μm long) (Figure 15.23). Tiny inclusions are also observed in  this large matrix, including zircon (ZrSiO4), barium sulphate (BaSO4), compounds of Sr and,  less commonly, Ce and La (only observed for sample GN1-11). All these associated chemistries  are consistent with the composition of the quartzite bedrock.  Both the bedrock and the white matrix contain all of the above elements and compounds, but  these occur in higher concentrations within the white matrix than in the bedrock. These higher  concentrations are a result of the dissolution and redeposition of bedrock chemistries into the  white matrix (Chalmin et al. 2017; Wray 2013). The white matrix is also composed of high  proportions of alumino-potassic-phosphate, a compound that is not present in the bedrock.  The  alumino-potassic-phosphate is here identified as leucophosphite (K(Fe, Al)2(PO4)2(OH) (H20)), with a small percentage of Fe substituting for Al, as determined by XRD-computed  tomography on sample GN1-3 (Chalmin et al. 2015, 2017). The presence of leucophosphite in  the white matrix enhances adherence of the overlying red paint onto the white matrix. Figure 15.23 SEM-EDX (ZEISS-Ultra+, 30 kV) chemical mapping across the cross-section of sample  GN1-11. Source: Photographs by Emilie Chalmin. Raman analyses on a number of samples reveal both chemical and structural evidence of gypsum  (CaSO42H2O). The gypsum is confirmed for samples GN1-3, GN1-4, GN1-5, GN1-6, GN1-8  and GN1-11; all are from Panel A. Additionally, even if this gypsum compound is not clearly  identified for the samples coming from the two macropods (GN1-1, GN1-2), the presence of  both elements Ca and S is consistent with its presence. Gypsum sometimes occurs as small crystals  embedded within the white matrix (e.g. in sample GN1-11), and sometimes as a homogeneous  sublayer between the white matrix and the overlying pigment layer (e.g. in sample GN1-3).  Optical microscopy reveals that black particles a few microns long are embedded in the white  matrix of almost all samples. Raman analysis indicates that these are black soot, probably from  landscape fires (cf. Gunn 2011). The paint layers The colour intensity of the paint layer relates closely to the thickness of the layer and thus to  the quantity of paint. The chemical mapping as observed by the SEM-EDX in back-scattered  electron (BSE) mode further confirms this close correlation between the intensity of red  colouring (highlighting the red paint layer) and the incidence of iron in sample cross-sections.  The spatial patterning of element distributions across sample cross-sections allows for an enhanced  characterisation of the micro-stratigraphy of individual samples as well as a better determination  of the thickness of each layer. The thickness of the paint layer varies from 3 μm to 360 μm  between samples. The thickest paint layers occur in samples where the paint layer is capped by  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="21"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    443  a mineral crust that protects the paint from leaching away. In many samples, the paint layer  is well preserved in the micro-pores or micro-fractures of the bedrock’s surface. Nevertheless,  wherever a paint layer is found, it is particularly thin and it occurs close to the surface of the rock  wall. The thinness of all the paint layers is largely explained by some degree of leaching of the  rock wall surface. However, strong adhesion of paint matter on and in the rough rock surface  has allowed for the preservation of paintings over considerable periods of time. In no sample  did optical microscopy or chemical mapping reveal more than a single layer of paint in any of  the cross-sections, except for sample GN1-4 that exhibits three layers of paint (see below). The  chemical mapping carried out on the cross-sections confirms the absence of diffusion of pigment  into the surrounding matrix, but rather suggests that paint layers on or near the rock surface  exhibit considerable degrees of adherence and stability. Raman micro-spectroscopy confirms the presence of essentially ‘pure’ iron oxides as the paint  layers (but see below for associated trace elements observed independently): haematite (Fe2O3)  for the red pigment and goethite (FeOOH) for the yellow (Figure 15.24).  Figure 15.24 Raman spectra obtained on samples GN1-2, GN1-3, GN1-6 and GN1-8, revealing the  presence of haematite (H), goethite (G), quartz (Q) and gypsum (Gy). Source: Illustration by Emilie Chalmin. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="22"> 444    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia The morphology of the haematite crystals is particularly difficult to observe due to their small  size (&lt;1 μm long). The good resolution of the SEM-FEG enables recognition of hexagonal sheets  of haematite.  PIXE analyses on the paint layers reveal similar proportions of trace elements Mn, V, Zn and Rb  in samples GN1-3, GN1-4, GN1-5, GN1-6 and GN1-11 (see Table 15.2). These elements are  found together with the iron oxides; these associations have the potential to inform on whether  or not the pigments have a common origin. The occurrence of these trace elements in similar  proportions between samples suggests the employment of very similar paints in Images #1, #2,  #5 (the large bird motif ), #9 and #10 (the large waterbird) on Panel A. The chemistry of this  paint could, but does not necessarily, consist of the pigment from ochre crayons alone. The crusts The thin white or grey mineral crust that in some samples overlies the paint layer could have  formed from a number of possible processes. The crust’s white deposit is similar in composition  to the white matrix that underlies the paint layer, and could thus represent a remobilisation of  the weathered rock. Some grey crusts overlying paint layers are mainly composed of precipitated  NaCl salt. In our analyses, organic compounds such as oxalates are not clearly detected by Raman  micro-spectroscopy; only some unidentified bands in the spectra may suggest the presence of  organic compounds. Gypsum is only detected as a layer immediately underneath paint layers.  The surface of sample GN1-16 – from one of the birds (Image #49) on Panel C – is covered with  white magnesium salt (probably MgCO3), making the underlying red pigment’s colour lighter  than on the other panels. Discussion of geochemistry Physico-chemical analyses of rock art on four painted panels at JSARN–124 site 3 highlight  the use of iron oxides as pigment, with both haematite and goethite having been employed.  The small size of the iron oxide crystals, the micro-stratigraphy of the samples and the complex  post-art mixing of minerals originating from weathering of the rock and from salt precipitates  make it difficult to further characterise the pigment observed as very thin paint layers. Despite  the fact that a number of colours were observed, there is a general homogeneity in the chemistry  of the pigment layers (and therefore of the analysed paintings). However, the presence of some  impurities (trace elements or minor differences) in several samples suggests that some iron  oxides may have originated from different sources, or that a number of paint mixtures may  have been used. A number of distinct red paint pastes can thus be distinguished among the  paintings at JSARN–124 site 3, with Images #1, #2, #5, #9 and #10 from Panel A having  different characteristics to those of Images #49 and #51 from Panels C and D.  The physico-chemical analysis is not able to provide definitive information on the actual age  of these paintings (but see below). As to the relative chronology of the layers of paint observed  in many of the samples, the cross-sections have revealed a single paint layer on or very near  the surface. These paint layers are very thin and in only one case do they show evidence of  multiple painting events, although the thinness of the paint layers and their proximity to the  surface would not always permit detection of multiple painting events using single colours. More  specifically, in sample GN1-11, where the painting of the spear (Image #9) intersects the large  bird motif (Image #5), there are no signs of two separate layers of red paint in cross-section, but  rather the red paint appears as a single, merged layer. This observation – and the absence of any  crust development between two layers of paint – suggests that the spear and the large bird were  probably painted at approximately the same time. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="23"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    445  In the only sample exhibiting evidence of multiple paint layers, sample GN1-4 from the  intersection of the spear (Image #9) and the large anthropomorph (Image #6), a layer of dark  red and a separate layer of light red indicate two different painting events. It is not possible from  the cross-sections alone to determine which of the two layers relates to 1) the spear (Image #9)  and 2) the anthropomorph (Image #6). However, the dark red of the spear visually corresponds  in colour to the upper, dark-red layer, while the light red of the anthropomorph corresponds  in colour to the underlying, light-red layer. We therefore conclude that the spear overlies the  anthropomorph, which is consistent with the pattern of superimposition evident from the  D-Stretch enhancement (see Figure 15.6). We may even say a little more about the relative age of the spear and anthropomorph paintings by  reference to the relative thickness of their paint layers (the dark- and light-red layers respectively).  As noted above, across the site as a whole, those samples with a protective surface crust have  a noticeably thicker underlying paint layer than those without a crust. Sample GN1-4 does not  have a protective crust on its surface. However, the dark-red layer acts as a protective veneer over  the light-red layer, by the fact that it overlies it. That the two red layers of sample GN1-4 are of  similar thickness, and that the uppermost, dark-red layer is currently exposed to the elements  (i.e.  devoid of a protective crust), suggests that the underlying light-red layer was originally  thicker than it is now, having been slowly removed by minor water-wash and other forms of  weathering over time. That is, we suggest that the two layers of red pigment were not painted in  a single artistic event, but rather that some reasonable amount of time elapsed between the two  painting events. The discontinuous yellow layer under both the red layers is diffuse, making it difficult to  determine whether it is a layer of pigment in its own right (i.e. representing a yellow painting  that is too faded, weathered away or covered by subsequent paintings to see on Panel A today)  or the product of alteration of the white matrix through weathering. It is unlikely to represent the  ‘bleeding’ of the overlying red layer in contact with the white matrix, because in all other cross- sections the pigment layers have relatively distinct boundaries when in contact with the white  matrix, indicating great stability of the well-adhered pigment. The presence of gypsum as a thin layer of crystalised salt below the pigment layers across the  span of Panel A, as well as on Panels D and E, can be attributed to a period when salts were  being leached out of the bedrock and re-deposited on the rock face through the prolonged  condensation of water, prior to the making of the paintings. Prior to the artworks, the rock  surface thus contained a thin, extensive but discontinuous crust of gypsum on its surface. This  discontinuous crust layer induces a subsequent spalling effect, as observed locally on the present  surface of Panel A (Doehne 2002; Hernanz et al. 2007). As previously documented at other  rock art sites (Goodall et al. 2009; Hernanz et al. 2007), gypsum efflorescence tends to weaken  the stability of rock surfaces. Elsewhere, in northeastern Australia, Goodall et al. (2009) have  previously interpreted the presence of gypsum in stratified micro-layers over or under rock art  as an indicator of dry climatic conditions, due to exposed gypsum’s solubility in water during  wetter conditions. Overall, these results cannot falsify the idea that the oldest paintings at JSARN–124 site 3,  including the large bird motif itself and its associated spear painting, have a late Pleistocene  antiquity. Rather, these analyses indicate that 1) the paintings were made after a dry phase  (see below for a more refined interpretation); and 2) they theoretically could have survived on  such a surface over a very long period of time. As far as the chemistry is concerned, whether they  did or did not remains in question. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="24"> 446    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Archaeological excavations Most of the art, including the large bird motif, occurs on Panel A along the northern side of the site.  Our original objective was to excavate directly underneath the large bird motif, hoping we might  retrieve exfoliated or otherwise collapsed fragments of rock by which to obtain stratigraphically  a maximum age for the creation of the subsequently painted rock wall surface, and exfoliated  spalls with traces of ochre from which to obtain minimum ages for the on-wall art, or in situ  ochre crayons potentially dating the large bird motif overhead (for a comparable methodology,  see Chapter 14). As noted above, the small overhang above the large bird motif measures just  1.5 m deep, but was once part of a larger overhang that has since collapsed (see below for details).  Unfortunately, the collapsed overhang prevented any excavation from taking place directly below  the art, and indeed precluded any excavation on the northern side of the outcrop (Figures 15.3  and 15.25). Consequently, five excavation squares were positioned elsewhere around the site:  Squares A and C were located under a pronounced overhang on the eastern side, and Squares B,  D and E on the western side against the near-vertical rock wall (Figure 15.3). The positioning of  the squares was determined by their proximity to nearby art panels, perceived depths of deposits  and potential to elucidate chronological and contextual details of the large bird motif panel a  few metres away. Squares A, B, C and D each measured 50 × 50 cm; Square E was 1.2 × 1.0 m  in size. Excavated sediments were dry-sieved on-site in 2 mm mesh, and unsieved bulk sediment  samples were collected from each XU of every square. The sieved sediments were subsequently  sorted and analysed at the University of Southern Queensland archaeology laboratory. Munsell  colour attribution and pH tests were carried out on bulk samples in the laboratory. We present below the results of the excavations one square at a time.

Square A contains 53 stone artefacts with a total weight of 35.0 g (Table 15.5; Figure 15.28).  The assemblage is fairly homogenous in terms of mean weight and size (maximum dimensions),  as well as length, width and thickness.

Source: Illustration by Jerome Mialanes and Lara Lamb. All artefacts are made of quartzite. These can be further sub-divided into two types, micro- crystalline (grain size &lt;0.5 mm, present in all XUs) and fine-grained quartzite (0.5–1.0 mm grain  size, present in XU4 and XU5 only; see Figure 15.30). A peak in the weight of micro-crystalline  quartzite artefacts in XU2 is due to a single, relatively large artefact weighing 10.9 g.

Unipolar, freehand percussion (complete) flakes (47 per cent of all stone artefacts from Square A)  dominate the stone artefact assemblage in all XUs, followed by flaked pieces (26 per cent) and  broken ‘other’ (13 per cent), which is a category reserved for broken flakes that cannot be neatly  categorised as proximal, distal, medial or lateral pieces (Table 15.6). A single retouched flake  was recovered from XU2, produced on micro-crystalline quartzite of a similar Munsell colour  (2.5Y 8/1) to the quartzite block that rests atop the northern end of the square. This flake is  retouched along 100 per cent of its two lateral margins, which run roughly parallel to each other.  The flake is 55.5 mm along its longest lateral margin and 22 mm wide; it also has two parallel  dorsal ridges, all of which give the artefact the appearance of a ‘blade’. One heavily reduced  bipolar core (rotated 90°) was recovered from XU3. It is 27 mm long (maximum dimension),  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="30"> 452    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia and was reduced by two visible platforms; it has 14 negative flake scars originating from both  platforms combined. The dominant colours throughout the artefact assemblage are light- to  brownish-grey (10YR 8/1 to 10YR 6/2) and light-grey to greyish-yellow (2.5Y 8/1 to 2.5Y 7/2).  Less than 5 per cent of the total flaked stone artefacts are reddish-grey (10Y 4/4 to 10R 6/6) in  colour; these could not have come from the core stone slab immediately adjacent to Square A.

SU1 spans from ground surface to  a  maximum depth of 7 cm; it consists of loose, homogeneous weak-red sand (2.5YR 5/3).  SU2 below it extends to a maximum depth of 32.7 cm below ground, and consists of slightly  more compact pale-brown sand (10YR 6/3). SU3 goes down to a maximum depth of 45 cm,  and consists of light yellowish-brown sand (10YR 6/4) with large, angular quartzitic sandstone  blocks. SU4 consists of light yellowish-brown sand (10YR 6/4) with angular quartzitic sandstone  blocks and small rounded pisoliths at its base (Figure 15.32).

Chronology Seven AMS radiocarbon dates on individual pieces of charcoal collected in situ were obtained  from Square B (Table 15.4). Radiocarbon dates of 1632 ± 20 BP (Wk-40577) from 8.1 cm depth  in XU4, 1575 ± 20 BP (Wk-40578) from 14.9 cm depth in XU8 and 1702 ± 20 BP (Wk-40579)  from 19.9 cm depth in XU10 all calibrate to a similar age within the range 1411–1692 cal BP  (see Table 15.4 for details). All three determinations are from SU2. Below these in SU3, four dates  of 2248 ± 20 BP (Wk-40580) from 22.6 cm depth, 4482 ± 20 BP (Wk-40581) from 26.2 cm  depth, 8882 ± 30 BP (Wk-40582), from 36.3 cm depth and 11,983 ± 35 BP (Wk-32128) from  40.4 cm depth are in correct chrono-stratigraphic order, indicating good stratigraphic integrity  of deposits. No in situ charcoal was obtained from SU4. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="33"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    455  The Square B ages of 13,739–13,976 cal BP at 40.4 cm depth and 9901–10,171 cal  BP at  36.3 cm depth, are separated by c. 3821 years over 4.1 cm vertical depth (= 0.11 cm of sediment  build-up/100 years, taking the median calibrated ages). Those of 9901–10,171 cal BP at 36.3 cm  depth and 5041–5286 cal BP at 26.2 cm depth, are separated by c. 4916 years over 10.1 cm  vertical depth (= 0.21 cm/100 years). And those of 5041–5286 cal BP at 26.2 cm depth and  2159–2338 cal BP at 22.6 cm depth, are separated by c. 2844 years over 3.6 cm vertical depth (=  0.13 cm/100 years). These results suggest a fairly consistent pattern of sediment build-up from  terminal Pleistocene times through much of the Holocene. Excavated materials A total of 441.9 g of charcoal was excavated from Square B (Table 15.8). The pattern of discard  for charcoal shows four distinct phases (Figure 15.33): • Phase 1 (SU4): From XU45 to XU22 in SU4 in the undated lower levels of the square, which  are older than 13,739–13,976 cal BP, charcoal densities are low with a total weight of 2.8 g. • Phase 2 (SU3): Charcoal densities increase markedly above XU21 at the SU4–SU3 interface,  dating from c. 13,739–13,976 cal BP, to XU15 dating to c. 5041–5286 cal BP at the top of  SU3. This period saw an average charcoal net deposition rate of 12.0 g/1000 years. • Phase 3 (SU3-SU2 interface): From XU14 at the top of SU3 dating to c. 5041–5286 cal BP,  to XU11 at the bottom of SU2 dating to c. 1553–1692 cal BP, there is a decrease to 7.2 g/1000  years in charcoal deposition rates, marking a hiatus or period of ephemeral occupation lasting  c. 3500 years. • Phase 4 (SU2): Charcoal deposition rates then increase gradually from XU12 dating to  c. 2159–2338 cal BP, to XU10 dating to c. 1553–1692 cal BP in SU2. During that period,  net charcoal deposition rates averaged 39.7 g/1000 years, and continued to increase to  1361.8 g/1000 years into XU4, dating to c. 1418–1598 cal BP (see Table 15.8 for raw data).

Ochrous pisoliths. Two of the excavated pisoliths were analysed for their chemistry to determine  whether or not such pisoliths could have been used to make some or all of the red artworks  at the site. Both pisoliths are red (10R 4/6 to 2.5YR 4/8) in colour, as are many of the others  found within the excavated sequence. No striations or other marks of use are evident under  magnification. For both pieces, SEM (at 20 kV with a LEO Stereoscan 440 SEM coupled by EDX) reveals  a  structure consisting of microscopic sheets of red pigment. These sheets vary in thickness  from a few microns to c. 10 μm each. They mainly contain Fe as iron oxide mixed with 1:1 Al:Si  ratios, as found in kaolinite clay.  PIXE analysis (3 MV microprobe, AGLAE Facility, Paris) indicates that the outer concretion  coating the fragment from XU26 contains a higher content of SiO2 and TiO2 than internally.  This outer coating is mainly composed of large quartz grains (&gt;200 μm long). Minor elements  of the inner parts of both samples include Mg, P, S, K. In both samples the low incidence  of Ca, V and Mn is comparable to those measured in the painting samples from art Panel A  (see Table 15.9). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="35"> 15.

However, the chemistry of the clay-containing  pisoliths is not consistent with that of the other on-wall paint samples, which do not show any  evidence of the presence of clays. This suggests that local pisoliths could have been used to paint  some of the red paintings analysed at the site, including but not limited to the two macropods  on Panel A, but probably not all of the red paintings because, unlike the analysed local pisoliths,  some are devoid of clays. Stone artefacts. A total of 308 stone artefacts with a total weight of 636.0 g was excavated  from Square B (Table 15.8; Figure 15.33). Eight raw material types are represented: fine-grained  quartzite (41.6 per cent), micro-crystalline quartzite (39.3 per cent), sandstone (4.8 per cent),  calcified quartzite (4.6 per cent), chert (3.6 per cent), coarse-grained quartzite (with 1.0–2.0 mm  long grain size, 2.6 per cent), milky quartz (2.9 per cent) and silcrete (0.6 per cent). Among the flaked stone artefacts, the frequency of fracture types is dominated by flaked pieces  (60.7 per cent), followed by complete flakes (16.9 per cent), distal portions (8.4 per cent) and  broken ‘other’ (7.5 per cent) (Table 15.10). Other fracture types represent &lt;2 per cent of the  assemblage. The single retouched flake in Square B comes from XU16. It  consists of a piece  of sandstone with one margin retouched along c. 50 per cent of its length. The assemblage  also contains two unipolar cores, from XU36 (55 g) and XU37 (45 g), on sandstone and find- grained quartzite respectively. Their relatively large sizes contribute to the higher mean weights  and maximum dimensions of these two XUs (Figure 15.34).

The flaked stone assemblage exhibits very little  cortex (3.2 per cent of artefacts). Coupled  with the overall small size of the artefacts,  the  implications are late stage reduction  sequences.  There are clear peaks in numbers and total  weights of stone artefacts around XU14– XU21 and XU25–XU28 (Figure 15.33). These  peaks are largely due to increased frequencies  of the two principal raw material types,  fine-grained and micro-crystalline quartzite  (Figure 15.35). However, when calculated  as deposition rates, there is little evidence of  major variation through the sequence, with  a minor decrease from 8.9 artefacts/1000 years  to 6.7  artefacts/1000 years between 1503– 1642 cal BP and 0–1503 cal BP.

Source: Illustration by Kara Rasmanis, Bruno David and Jean-Jacques Delannoy. Chronology Six AMS radiocarbon dates were obtained on individual pieces of charcoal from Square D.  Three of these come from SU2, and three come from SU3: • SU2: Dates of 89 ± 20 BP (Wk-40586) (calibrating to 31–256 cal BP) from 4.0 cm depth  in XU4; 458 ± 20 BP (Wk-40587) (calibrating to 498–527 cal BP) from 13.3 cm depth in  XU8; and 2448 ± 20 BP (Wk-40588) (calibrating to 2361–2699 cal BP) from 20.9 cm depth  in XU11, are in good chrono-stratigraphic order. The determination of 2448 ± 20 BP dates  the base of SU2, as indicated also by a similar date (see below) for the very top of SU3.  • SU3: 2459 ± 20 BP (Wk-40589) (calibrating to 2379–2545 cal BP) from 27.8 cm depth in  XU15; 8160 ± 27 BP (Wk-40590) (calibrating to 9014–9245 cal BP) from 31.3 cm depth  in XU20; and 7254 ± 27 BP (Wk-40591) (calibrating to 8008–8161 cal BP) from 41.3 cm  depth in XU22. Given that the two lowermost SU3 dates are considerably older than the SU2 dates, the  determination of 2459 ± 20 BP that is akin to the age of the base of SU2 was probably post- depositionally displaced downwards from the SU2–SU3 interface: there are only 3.8 cm of  sediment between the base of SU2 and that radiocarbon date. There is also a slight inversion  within SU3 between dates of 8160 ± 27 BP (31.3 cm depth in XU20) and 7254 ± 27 BP  (41.3 cm depth in XU22). The younger of these two dates came from very close to the rock  wall in the eastern section of the square. That rock wall is fully exposed to the elements, and fine  sediments including charcoal particles may have post-depositionally moved slightly downward  through factors such as wet-season rainwater action against the rock wall. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="45"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    467  The sequence of dates in Square D shows a similar pattern of slow sedimentation rates as seen  in Square B a few metres to the south. In Square D, the calibrated age of 9014–9245 cal BP  at 31.3 cm depth is separated from a calibrated age of 2379–2545 cal BP at 27.8 cm depth,  representing a period of c. 6773 years (based on median calibrated ages) for just 3.5 cm of deposit  at an average net sedimentation rate of 0.05 cm/100 years (see Table 15.4 for radiocarbon dates). Excavated materials A total of 260 g of charcoal was excavated from Square D. As with Square B nearby, beginning  c. 2600 cal BP there is a major, seven-fold increase in net charcoal deposition rates through  time from 10.2 g/1000 years in SU3 to 76.5 g/1000 years in SU2.

Four raw material types are represented (Figure 15.44):  fine-grained quartzite (41.7 per cent), sandstone (29.5 per cent), micro-crystalline quartzite  (25.2 per cent) and coarse-grained quartzite (3.6 per cent). The high proportion of sandstone  artefacts distinguishes the assemblage from those of other squares. These sandstone artefacts have  a mean weight of 26.2 g (and maximum of 499 g), adding considerably to the overall weight of  the flaked stone artefacts. Fracture types are dominated by flaked pieces (41.0 per cent), followed by complete flakes  (33.1 per cent) and broken ‘other’ (10.8 per cent). Distal portions, left-split cones, medial and  proximal portions, retouched flakes, unipolar cores and right-split cones each represent less than  5 per cent of the assemblage (Table 15.16). Each of the two retouched flakes was made on  sandstone; they are both retouched on both the left and distal margins (along 21 per cent and  12 per cent of the length, respectively). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="47"> 15.

The distribution of raw materials through time  reveals several patterns worthy of note. First,  there are no exotic materials in Square  D;  both the sandstone and quartzite could have  been sourced from the shelter itself. SU3  is characterised by a predominance of fine- grained quartzite and sandstone. SU2  marks  a noticeable shift in use from these raw  materials to micro-crystalline quartzite of  a brown/reddish hue (10YR, 2.5YR and 5YR)  (Figure 15.44). SU2 is also characterised  by a decrease in stone artefact discard rates,  from 17.3 artefacts/1000 years in SU3 to 9.6  artefacts/1000 years in SU2, and by a decrease  in the mean weight and maximum length  of artefacts (Figure 15.45).

Along its eastern edge, Square E is contiguous with Square B, and was thus  positioned to continue excavating Square B to greater depth than would have otherwise been  possible (Figure 15.46).

Ground penetrating radar Ground penetrating radar (GPR) investigations were undertaken to the southwest and south  of  the  rock stack (Figure 15.47), including the area of Squares B+E, and are extended over  Squares C and A by a single profile. GPR lines were collected in an approximately east–west  orientation with a spacing of 0.5 m between profiles using a Mala X3M instrument with  a 250 Mhz antenna. Acquisition settings include a sampling frequency of 10038 Mhz, a time  window of 102 ns, 1024 samples, a trace interval of 0.02 m and four stacks. The data were  processed using ReflexW software with a scheme of filters including move start time, subtract  mean (dewow), energy decay, background remove, bandpass and running average applied  sequentially (Goodman and Piro 2013). The results show that the bedrock morphology revealed  by excavation, being of a relatively flat surface with some small pieces of rock present in the  stratigraphy above it, is present extensively around the site. The sharp topographic depression  revealed in the Square B excavation continues to the south and widens to approximately 2 m with  gently sloping sides rather than the precipitous topography shown in excavation. This change in  subsurface geomorphology coincides with the southern edge of the sandstone stack. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="50"> 472    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 15.47 Ground penetrating radar work in progress in the area within and surrounding Square E,  prior to excavation.

SU1 reaches a maximum depth of 14 cm; it consists  of loose weak-red sand (2.5YR 5/3). SU2 extends to a maximum depth of 28 cm, consisting  of  slightly more compact pale-brown sand (10YR 6/3) incorporating some large, angular  quartzitic sandstone rocks. SU3 is light yellowish-brown (10YR 6/4) in colour and of similar  soft sediment consistency to SU2; it extends to a maximum depth of 43 cm. However, it is  marked by a steep increase in the number of large angular sandstone rocks that originated from  the rock outcrop above the square. SU4 extends down to bedrock. It consists of a similar light  yellowish brown sand (10YR 6/4) to SU3 above it, but contains fewer large angular blocks and  an abundance of small rounded pisoliths (Figures 15.32; see also Figure 15.31).

Chronology A total of 13 radiocarbon dates was obtained from Square E. Two came from SU1, five from  SU2 and six from SU3 (Table 15.4). No in situ charcoal was encountered in SU4, and thus no  radiocarbon dates were obtained from this lowermost horizon. The dates are in good chrono- stratigraphic order both within and between SUs: • SU1: 149 ± 20 BP (Wk-50535) at 5.9 cm depth in XU4 and 164 ± 20 BP (Wk-40536) at  6.4 cm depth in XU5. • SU2: All the dates from SU2 are late Holocene in age. The oldest is 1256 ± 22 BP (Wk-40541)  (calibrating to 1092–1277 cal BP) from 21.1 cm depth. • SU3: 4551 ± 23 BP (Wk-40542) (5061–5316 cal BP) from 26.7 cm depth; 6946 ± 27 BP  (Wk-40543) (7694–7839 cal BP) from 26.4 cm depth; 9205 ± 32 BP (Wk-40546) (10,254– 10,488 cal BP) from 27.3 cm depth; 9314 ± 33 BP (Wk-40544) (10,412–10,647 cal BP)  from 28.0 cm depth; 9968 ± 35 BP (Wk-40548) (11,264–11,606 cal BP) from 29.6 cm  depth; and 17,113 ± 83 BP (Wk-40545) (20,407–20,905 cal BP) from 30.3 cm depth. Square E provides the earliest dated evidence for human use of the site, sometime within the  calibrated age range 20,407–20,905 cal BP. However, this is a non-basal age, with a further  17 cm of sediment occurring below the level of this calibrated age. Extending a linear depth-age  curve from the surface to the base of the square gives a broad-scale estimate of c. 34,860 years  ago for the base of the excavation. However, the lower sediment rates in SU3 of just 3.9 cm every  12,890 years suggest that the base of the cultural sequence – located 15.1 ± 0.4 cm (the depth  range representing the thickness of XU27, where the lowest stone artefact is found) below  the lowermost calibrated age of 20,407–20,905 cal BP at 30.3 cm depth – is almost certainly  much older.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="52"> 474    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Excavated materials A total of 576 g of charcoal was excavated from Square E (Table 15.18, Figure 15.48). Charcoal  densities are very low in SU3 and SU4, averaging 4.9 g/1000 years in SU3 compared with  384.4 g/1000 years in SU2. This represents a 78-fold increase between the two horizons. Stone  artefact discard rates follow a similar pattern, with average deposition rates of 8.7 artefacts/1000  years in SU3 and 261.4 artefacts/1000 years in SU2, representing a 30-fold increase after  c. 5061–5316 cal BP. The implication is that the two phases of stone artefact deposition rates,  and charcoal densities, are related and the charcoal is probably indicative of landscape firing  practices.

The stone artefacts consist of 497 artefacts with a combined weight of 14,628.8 g (Table 15.18;  Figure 15.48). Of all the squares excavated at the site, Square E has the greatest diversity of  raw material types, with 12 categories present (Figure 15.49). Predominant is micro-crystalline  quartzite (61.2 per cent), followed by fine-grained quartzite (14.1 per cent), chert (6.6 per cent)  and sandstone (6.6 per cent). Also present is crystalline quartz, coarse-grained quartzite, basalt,  milky quartz, silcrete and a silcrete/chert composite (each &lt;5 per cent). Five flaked artefacts  exhibit distinct bands of both micro-crystalline and fine-grained quartzite, indicating that these  two raw material types could have come from the same source. On these five specimens, the  bands of fine-grained quartzite are closer than the micro-crystalline quartzite bands to the cortex. The Square E assemblage is dominated by flaked pieces (50.3 per cent), complete flakes  (24.5 per cent), distal portions (10.9 per cent) and broken ‘other’ (7.4 per cent). Also present are  bipolar cores, bipolar flakes, left-split cone, right-split cones, retouched flakes and unipolar cores,  each representing &lt;2 per cent of the total assemblage from the square (Table 15.19).

Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    477  The pattern of raw material distribution through time indicates a higher reliance on sandstone  in SU3 than elsewhere. A 28-fold increase in average discard rates from SU3 (8.8 artefacts/1000  years) to SU2 (257 artefacts/1000 years) is largely due to an increased incidence of micro- crystalline quartzite, chert and coarse-grained quartzite in SU2. This suggests that the increase is  not solely due to increasing use of local quartzites, but to exotic chert as well. Other raw material  types are also introduced into SU2, including silcrete and milky quartz. In SU1, deposition rates  average 107 artefacts/1000 years, with micro-crystalline quartzite remaining the predominant  raw material type (Figure 15.49). Figure 15.49 Distribution of stone artefacts by raw material type for Square E, by XU. Source: Illustration by Jerome Mialanes and Lara Lamb. The distribution of fracture types reveals an important trend (Table 15.19). With the exception  of a single bipolar core in SU3, all artefacts exhibiting the use of a bipolar or bifacial technique  are found in SU2. This corresponds with a horizon of diminished use of sandstone and increased  use of micro-crystalline quartzite and exotic materials including silcrete, chert and milky quartz.  Also apparent is the reduced mean weight and maximum dimensions of artefacts from SU3 to  SU2, corresponding with the diminished use of sandstone, a raw material type that typically  produced the larger and heavier flaked stone artefacts in the assemblage (Figures 15.49 and 15.50). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="56"> 478    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 15.50 Mean weight and maximum length of stone artefacts from Square E, by XU.

Working out the history of JSARN–124 site 3 through  geomorphological reconstruction An important, albeit underused, way of exploring the history of decorated rock surfaces is through  geomorphology. We can thus begin to explore the history of JSARN–124 site 3’s paintings and  hand stencils by seeing the rock stack as two articulating geological components: a geologically  in situ base, rock strata D0 and D1; and a superimposing and partly overhanging cap, D3 to D8  (Figures 15.3, 15.51 and 15.52). The rock cap is inclined by the westward tilt of strata D3 to D8,  a geologically ancient phenomenon long pre-dating any people in the landscape. All of the artworks on Panels A–E are painted or stencilled on flat sections of the wall; the flatness  of these vertical surfaces contrasts with the overall ruggedness of the profile of strata D0 to D8,  each of which is variably resistant to erosion. Figure 15.51 demonstrates the rock stack’s contrasting  surfaces. The south face, associated closely with the effects of erosion, has a very rugged profile,  whereas the north face on which is found the large bird motif of Panel A is characterised by  expansive smooth surfaces. These smooth surfaces were created by the collapse of the outer reaches  of a considerably longer overhang than that present today (and thus the art on those surfaces must  be more recent than the age of the final collapse(s) that created the surfaces). For the area of Panel  A, this is evident by the massive boulder collapse that fronts the north face. The situation is similar  for the other smooth surfaces that house art panels (Panels B–E). Each of those smooth surfaces  was produced by the collapse of part of the rock wall or overhang, effectively representing the sheer  planes of those collapses. Determining the antiquity of those collapses is the key to understanding  the maximum possible ages of the paintings that today decorate these smooth wall surfaces. As all  of the artworks present today could only have been made after those rock surfaces formed, so we  aim to understand the maximum possible age of the artworks by understanding the age of those  surfaces. From the onset, one of our major aims of research at JSARN–124 site 3 has thus been  to determine the antiquity of wall and overhang collapses in those areas that contain artworks.  We have done this by cross-examining surface geomorphological details with the evidence revealed  by each of the five archaeological excavations (Squares A–E). A major tool in these investigations  was a 3-D laser mapping of the site. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="57"> 15.

We can do this fairly precisely for the eastern (Squares A and C) and  western (Squares B+E and D) sides of the rock stack, with the evidence from those investigations  allowing us to show conclusively an evolutionary schema for the site as a whole, including the  north face that contains the large bird motif. The radiocarbon evidence from the excavations  enables us to attribute a chronological framework for the major phases of wall and overhang  collapse and, in doing so, for the artworks themselves. Geomorphology of areas near the excavated squares The geomorphological analyses and reconstructions in part focus on Squares A and C on the  eastern side of the site, and in part in the area of Squares B+E and D on the western side. Geomorphology in area of Squares A and C Squares A and C are located on the eastern side of the rock stack (Figure 15.52), adjacent to the  Panel B paintings on stratum D3. Both squares are protected from the elements by a c. 3 m wide  strata D5–D8 overhang. The base of Square A lies 9 cm below the present ground surface. The excavation square was  positioned on the edge of an exposed rock slab with a smooth surface and flaked edge. This  slab lies flat on sandy sediments under the strata D5–D8 overhang. The slab came from ceiling  stratum D8. Its flat position on the ground and its flaked edges indicate that it had been moved  and worked anthropically after detachment from the rock wall (Figure 15.53).

Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. The base of Square C is at 17 cm depth. The square is located 1.0 m to the south of Square A.  Despite the presence of minor clastic elements, like those of Square A the Square C sediments are  exclusively composed of sand grains that under microscopic examination exhibit aeolian impact  marks (i.e. they are aeolian sands). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="59"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    481  The solid rock base of both Squares A and C is hard, flat and slightly sloping southward. The 3°  slope is similar to the dip of the rock stack’s pedestal strata D1 and D0, suggesting that the base  of the two excavation squares represent the surface of the bedrock (rather than a buried collapsed  ceiling slab). To determine this better, we used the site’s digital 3-D model to project the angle of  the Square E bedrock base on the western side of the rock stack, towards Square C on its opposite,  eastern side, revealing a common dip and perfect (continuous) alignment (Figure 15.54). Given  that the base of Square E has been conclusively shown by excavation of the overlying sediments,  extending to Square B and hence to the rock stack’s western wall, to represent the quartzitic  bedrock (see the results of the archaeological excavations, above), the rocky base of Squares A and  C can also be securely identified as bedrock. Figure 15.54 The dotted horizontal white lines represent the level of the flat rock surfaces at the  base of Squares C and E. Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. The Panel B artworks occur on the flat, vertical wall surface of strata D3 and D4. That surface was  created when parts of a low overhang became detached from the back wall; the collapsed rocks  from that detachment are now neither on nor in the ground. In this part of the site, the ground  consists of a blanket of aeolian sands directly overlying bedrock. This absence of the fallen rocks  requires explanation and remains largely unanswered. Whatever its causes, the collapse of strata  D3–D4 is of a considerable antiquity that precedes the presence of people at the site. Archaeological implications of the geomorphology The flat surface on which the Panel B artworks were made is thus also both very old and precedes  human presence. The shallowness of the sand layer that blankets the bedrock in this part of the  site can be explained by exposure to the dominant winds that, coming from the east-southeast,  have a greater tendency to transport sand away from this part of the site than to deposit it here.  It is difficult to estimate the sedimentation rates involved, as the deposited sands can be rapidly  remobilised by wind to be redeposited further downwind on the western side of the rock stack  in the vicinity of Squares B+E and D against the rock stack. The radiocarbon dates from Squares  A and C are in correct chrono-stratigraphic order, indicating that the present sand sheet dates at  least to the past 2444 ± 25 BP (2380–2412 cal BP) (Table 15.4). The detached rock slab at the northern edge of Square A (see Figure 15.26) is not in its original  position. It originated from the collapse of the upper part of the overhang nearby (stratum D8), but  its current location away from its originating position, its flat, sub-horizontal positioning on aeolian  sands and the presence of extensive flaking along its edge indicate that it was moved and worked  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="60"> 482    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia by people in the past (Figure 15.53). The timing of the slab’s repositioning was probably late in  the site’s occupational history, given its stratigraphic position above the upper SUs of Square A.  Nevertheless, the apparently fairly recent age of its current positioning remains to be confirmed,  as it is possible that the aeolian sands beneath the slab remained in situ only once the slab was  redeposited to its present position, but that it originated in earlier times than those of the current  Square A sediments. We cannot test these possibilities as we have not excavated beneath the slab. We do not have enough geomorphological data from this part of the site to determine the age  of the artworks. But this is not the case for the western side of the site. Geomorphology in area of Squares B+E Squares B+E are located along the western edge of the rock stack (Figure 15.3), sheltered from  the dominant winds. The two squares were positioned along the longitudinal axis of the rock  stack’s strata D0 and D1 pedestal, close to the Panel C artworks (see Figure 15.11). Here, the art  spans much of the height of the flat surface along the near-vertical edge of stratum D3. Excavation of Squares B+E progressed down to bedrock, which steeply deepens against the rock  stack wall in much of Square B. This steep deepening of the bedrock surface is due to chemical  weathering along a north–south fissure that delimits the western edge of the rock stack’s base. Angular blocks tens of centimetres to metres in length are found both at depth and at ground  level. These originated from a succession of strata D3–D6 overhang collapses above Squares B+E.  The width of the original sheltered area under ceiling strata D4–D5 was about 2 m from the back  wall to the outer edge of the overhang. The Squares B+E sediments The Squares B+E section drawings reveal soft and rocky sediments that originated from a range  of morphogenic processes, including roof-fall (Figure 15.52). The basal levels of the excavations  also provide information on diagenic processes taking place at the deepest levels over bedrock.  Petrographic analysis coupled with comparisons of the thicknesses of the excavated blocks against  those of nearby rock strata have enabled the origins of the excavated rocks to be determined. Analyses of sediments from the base of the excavated squares to the present ground surface  (see Figure 15.55) reveals the following sequence of events: 1. The bedrock at the base of Squares B+E shows signs of considerable physical and chemical  weathering. Such weathering is evident along the deep, disintegrating fissure that contains  ferruginous pisoliths along the base of Square B where the weathering bedrock is in contact  with rocky sediments. At the base of this weathering fissure – effectively a slow-forming  but active solution channel against the rock stack’s western wall – pisoliths are trapped  in a soft, cement-like matrix. Although the composition of this cement-like matrix has  not been analysed, it is characteristic of areas where groundwater pools in impermeable  or semi-permeable quartzite concavities. Such sediments are a product of alteration of  the surrounding rock. Over geological time scales measured in the millions of years, the  entrapping dissolution channel gradually enlarges to form part of a ‘ghost rock’ or pillar  landscape such as that found today in the pillared rockshelter of Nawarla Gabarnmang  9 km to the northwest of JSARN-124 site 3 (cf. Delannoy et al. 2013). At JSARN-124  site 3, it is this kind of slow geological process that saw the breakdown and mechanical  collapse of rock strata D1 and D3 above the dissolution channel now evident at the base of  Square B. The narrow but deep cavity of stratum D2 between rock strata D1 and D3 was  caused by this same geological process of dissolution and geological evacuation of alteration  products. It is from this stratum D2 level that overlying strata D3 to D7 became tilted. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="61"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    483  2. A horizon of pisoliths close to bedrock is capped by centimetre-size rock clasts that originated  from breakdown of the overhanging rock ceiling. Today there is widespread millimetre-  to centimetre-scale fragmentation of the rock both along the overhang and along the  wall. The scale of this fragmentation can differ in different areas, depending on its causes  (e.g. thermoclastic exfoliation, gravitational block collapse, weakening of bedding planes). 3. Above this horizon of small, fragmented rock clasts is a pile of large rocks and angular  gravels. At least two depositional events can be differentiated through the buried rocks  located in SU4 and SU3. The first is the collapse of the underlying, overhanging section  of rock stratum D3. The collapsed, now-buried blocks follow the surface configuration  of the bedrock, having become jammed in the dissolution channel; where the bedrock is  more or less horizontally flat, the collapsed rock has piled up. This first (lowermost) deposit  of collapsed rock is covered by a second aggregation of rocks that signals collapse of the  remainder of overhanging stratum D3. How much time elapsed between these two rock-fall  events is difficult to estimate with the available evidence. It is the sum of these two overhang  collapses that resulted in the creation of the smooth vertical rock surface that now exhibits  art Panel C. The paintings of Panel C cannot therefore have been done before completion  of the D3 rock collapse (see below). 4. Overlying the stratum D3 rock collapse are soft sediments largely comprised of aeolian  sands. Not as abundant in underlying levels, these aeolian sands now become dominant,  covering the collapsed stratum D3 rocks. Lying horizontally flat within these aeolian sands  are rock slabs fallen from a localised section of the overhanging stratum D4 ceiling. These  collapsed slabs are covered by aeolian sands. 5. Above the present ground surface near and to the north of Squares B+E are large blocks  of rock that have collapsed onto each other step-wise. These correspond to the collapse of  the outer overhanging edges of rock strata D4–D5 and D6.  Figure 15.55 Evolution of the overhang above Squares B+E, showing the build up of sediments  as evidenced from the north section of those two excavation squares.

Archaeological implications of the geomorphology We have tried to link the archaeology (including rock art), geomorphology and geochemistry,  so as to understand better the art, and especially the large bird painting on art Panel A. The red paintings adjacent to and above Squares B+E were made on a relatively flat, vertical  surface. This flat surface represents a scar created by the collapse of stratum D3. In Squares B+E,  the layout of buried and surface rocks originating from this same stratum D3 indicates two phases  of strata D3 and D4’s collapse. The fallen rocks from the final stage of the stratum D3 collapse  have accumulated on an ancient ground surface that represents an earlier phase of stratum D3’s  collapse, together evident in SU4 and SU3 of the excavations in Squares B+E. Radiocarbon  determinations on charcoal date the first phase of the stratum D3 collapse to sometime before  17,113 ± 83 BP (20,407–20,905 cal BP), and the second after 11,983 ± 35 BP (13,739–13,976  cal BP) (Table 15.4). It was at the end of these two phases of collapse that the overhanging rock  that once completely and then partially covered the vertical rock surface on which art Panel  C was subsequently painted fell, thereby creating the now-painted vertical rock surface. The  paintings on Panel C must therefore post-date 13,739–13,976 cal BP. The upper, horizontal surface of stratum D1 also displays negative flake scars, evidence of stone  quarrying (Step 3 on Figure 15.55). Stone artefacts located above the material from the final  collapse of stratum D3 in Square B originally came from the top of stratum D1. We know this  because these now-buried artefacts exhibit the same thicknesses and petrographic characteristics as  the removed rock evident in the stratum D1 scars. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal obtained from  stratigraphic levels above the buried stratum D1 artefacts give an age of c. 4500 BP (combined  range: 5041–5316 cal BP) (Table 15.4). The combined geomorphological, archaeological and radiocarbon dating evidence allows  us to further refine the timing of the second phase of rock collapse and stone quarrying to  between 13,739–13,976 cal BP and 5041–5316 cal BP. We do not know when after 13,739– 13,976 cal  BP the artworks on Panel C were made. However, in layers dated to sometime  between 13,739–13,976 cal BP and 5041–5316 cal BP, the excavations in Squares B+E revealed  a concentration of stone artefacts flaked from the adjacent sub-horizontal surface of stratum  D1. If  the artworks on Panel C were made at the same time as the working of stratum D1,  representing a period of peak human activity in this part of the site, then the nearby Panel C  artworks would also date to between 13,739–13,976 cal BP and 5041–5316 cal BP. Geomorphology in area of Square D Square D is located 2.5 m to the north of Squares B+E, also straddling the edge of the rock stack’s  strata D0–D1 pedestal. The excavation was undertaken adjacent to Panel D (see Figure 15.3),  which occurs on the flat, near-vertical lower face of stratum D5 (hitherto D5a; see Figure 15.56  below). The excavation reached bedrock at a maximum depth of 58 cm below ground (Figure 15.42).  Here, there is clear evidence of a shallow weathering channel along the same north–south fissure  line that was also reached in Square B.  The Square D excavation has revealed a similar sediment sequence to that of contiguous  Squares B+E, with the presence of angular blocks measuring in the tens of centimetres originating  from a number of phases of wall or overhang collapse (strata D5b–D6–D7–D8). These fallen  blocks are varied in size and are covered by a horizontally aligned layer of smaller rocks that contrast  with the overlying horizon by their relatively homogeneous lengths and thicknesses. This layer of  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="63"> 15.

Figure 15.56 Northwestern corner of the rock stack showing location of Square D relative to nearby  collapsed blocks and ceiling of present overhang immediately overhead. Source: Illustrations by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. The positioning of Square D away from the Panel C artworks is of interest, as it is located along  the axis of the rock face that was formed by the collapse of strata D5–D6–D7, where the Panel A  artworks are now found (including the large bird motif ) (Figure 15.56). On Figure 15.56A,  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="64"> 486    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia we show the position of Square D, together with its upward projection towards the overhang  (on this figure, Panel A is on the left-hand side just around the corner of the overhang and of  the upward projection of the left-hand corner of Square D, and therefore cannot be seen from  this angle). On Figure 15.56B, the ceiling of the overhang is shown looking straight up from  the position of Square D below. Here we can see that Square D is positioned directly under the  detachment scar along which are found the artworks of Panel A. Given that the positioning of  Square D allows us to simultaneously investigate the evolution of the rock in the area of Panels A  and D, we undertook a detailed analysis of the morphogenesis of this part of the site, both in the  field and through the digital 3-D model. The Square D sediments: Archaeomorphological implications The stratigraphic sequence for Square D (Figure 15.41) brings to light materials that originated  from different morphogenic processes. As previously noted (cf. Squares B+E), the sequence of  collapsed materials found on and in the ground, coupled with the extant layout of the rock stack’s  strata, have enabled us to determine a suite of morphogenic stages for the area around Square D.  The lithology and thickness of the fallen blocks revealed in the excavation and at ground level  nearby permit us to reconstruct the origins of these blocks on the rock stack. From the base of the Square D excavation to the ground surface, we identify the following  sequence of events (Figures 15.41, 15.42 and 15.56–15.58): 1. The bedrock here carries traces of strong physical and chemical alteration. The evidence  consists of the deepening of a fissure in, and the presence of ferruginous pisoliths on, the  bedrock (alteration residues). These pisoliths are here held by a ‘cement’ (revealed at the base  of the eastern edge of the excavation square, along the longitudinal axis of the rock stack’s  pedestal at D0). This indurated cement is the product of a very old phase of alteration of  the quartzite bedrock. 2. The hard bedrock surface and pisolith cement are superimposed by angular blocks that are  lying at varied angles, moulding to the shape of the solution channel. Lithological analysis  permits us to identify these angular blocks as originating from stratum D3a. 3. Above this mass of rock collapse are clastic materials of smaller size that cover the underlying  ‘tumble’ of blocks: these smaller overlying rocks are similar in lithology, size and shape to  the exfoliated rocks found at the base of Square E. The origin of these clasts may be linked  to mechanical weakening and thermoclastic exfoliation. These clasts mould to the shape of  the underlying surface configuration, filling in the solution channel. 4. Above this clastic layer, we find a new accumulation of blocks and angular rocks whose  origin is the collapse of a new section of the overhang that once sheltered Square D.  The  collapsed blocks that now lie on the ground surface were digitally reattached onto  strata D3b–D4 and D5, confirming their original positions (Figure 15.58). It is at the end  of this phase of collapse that the flat, vertical rock surface, on which the Panel D artworks  now lie, was formed. 5. Under this collapsed material (SU3b), we find the presence of angular blocks that are  relatively homogeneous in length and that lie sub-horizontally. These blocks came from  stratum D1. They testify to the anthropic flaking of the surface of stratum D1, as evidenced  by percussion scars on the present stratum D1 surface (Figure 15.57). 6. The upper levels of the excavation reveal an aeolian quartz sand sheet that seals the  underlying rocky layers. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="65"> 15.

The red paintings above  Square  D  (Panel D) were made on the smooth vertical surface formed by the collapse of the  overhang that previously existed. That collapse concerned strata D3b–D4 and D5 and took place  after 8160 ± 27 BP (9014–9245 cal BP), as indicated by the radiocarbon dates from XU19 under  the fallen blocks. This timing from Square D is consistent with the second phase of collapse that has  been identified in the Squares B+E excavations (dating to after 13,739–13,976 cal BP). Similarly,  the horizon of anthropic artefacts originating from stratum D1 dates to a similar time frame to that  of Square B, here dated to after 2459 ± 20 BP (2379–2545 cal BP) (Table 15.4). The same sequence of events is apparent in the two excavation areas (Squares B+E, and Square D)  on the western edge of the site. These same sequences allow us to highlight the existence of  two major phases of rockfall, the rock debris from the first lying directly on the weathered  bedrock and its alteration products (pisoliths). After these rockfall events, there is evidence of  the human modification of the exposed, upper surface of stratum D1. This phase of quarrying  may be contemporaneous with painting activity on nearby flat surfaces, although this is not  certain. In both Squares B+E, and Square D, the overlying blanket of aeolian sands is dated from  2379–2545 cal BP continuing to today. The sum of these observations permits us to construct a broad chronological canvas for the  evolution of the site. Discussion of the geomorphology Geomorphological and archaeological investigations have revealed important dimensions relating  to the physical evolution of JSARN-124 site 3, including the sequence and general age of major  geological and anthropic events that gave shape to the site that we know today. The presence of large fallen blocks at the base of the rock stack’s northern face did not allow  us to undertake archaeological excavations immediately below Panel A. Nevertheless, the  geomorphological evidence obtained from the full circumference of the site, coupled with  archaeological and radiocarbon dating evidence obtained from Squares B+E, and especially  Square D at the northwestern corner of the rock stack, have enabled the collapse of the old  overhang on the north side to be broadly dated. It is only after this collapse that the northern  rock face became exposed and thus available to paint on (see Figure 15.59 for a synthesis). All of the five squares were excavated down to bedrock. These bedrock surfaces show points of  strength and weakness in the rock stack’s structure: the base of Squares A, C and E have revealed  the strongly resistant hard quartzite strata’s upper surfaces, while the base of Squares B and D have  exposed fissure lines that have been widened and deepened by chemical alteration. The pisoliths  present at contact with the bedrock represent mineral aggregates accumulated on the impermeable  quartzite bedrock: these pisoliths are largely made up of iron oxides and clay, and are themselves  sources of red ochre that could have been used to make red paintings and stencils at the site. JSARN-124 site 3 used to have larger overhangs on its western and northern sides than it does  today (Figure 15.58). The vertical rock surfaces that today house art Panels A, C, D and E did  not exist then: these smooth rock surfaces were formed by the collapse of the overhangs. The  rock debris revealed in Squares B+E and D, and at ground level on the northern edge of the rock  stack, are the products of those overhang collapses. The only art surface that could have existed  prior to these collapses is the one that houses art Panel B near Squares A and C under the eastern  overhang. None of the blocks that collapsed from stratum D3 and that resulted in the creation  of the vertical rock surface subsequently painted as Panel B is presently visible along the eastern  edge of the site, nor under the overhang where Squares A and C were excavated. This means  that here the stratum D3 vertical surface is ancient, and therefore the Panel B rock art could  theoretically be very old (or young). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="67"> 15.

Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. On the western side of the site, excavation Squares B+E, and Square D, have revealed two  major phases of overhang collapse. The first pre-dates 17,113 ± 83 BP (20,407–20,905 cal BP)  (Figure 15.59) and the second post-dates 11,983 ± 35 BP (13,739–13,976 cal BP). It is these two  phases of collapse that caused the formation of the smooth, vertical rock surfaces on the western  side of the site. The artworks on Panels C and D could only have been made after the second  collapse dated to 13,739–13,976 cal BP. The area immediately above Square D lies at the intersection of the northern and western margins  of the rock stack, a corner of the site that witnessed interconnecting rock collapse (Figures 15.56  and 15.60). The most obvious and most important of these collapses is particularly evident on  the north side of the site. Digital 3-D refitting of the large collapsed block transverse surfaces  onto the remnant rock stack conclusively shows that these collapsed blocks came from rock strata  that overhang Square D. The stratigraphic sequence of collapsed blocks also conclusively shows  that the north face’s (strata D5b–D6–D7) ancient overhang collapsed at the same time as the  second phase of collapse identified in both Square D and Squares B+E. That is, overhanging rock  strata D5b–D6–D7 became detached from the rock stack in the area of art Panel A after 13,739– 13,976 cal BP, at the end of the LGM. The artworks of Panel A must therefore be more recent  than 13,739–13,976 cal BP. As they cannot be older than this, they cannot be contemporaneous  with the bird Genyornis newtoni, unless G. newtoni survived the LGM into the Pleistocene– Holocene boundary. All evidence – zoological, paleontological, archaeological – from all parts of  Australia currently argue against such a late survival. terra australis 47 Temporal Dimension Precedes archaeological deposits Associated with archaeological deposits Stable overhang  above Squares A and  C </page> <page sequence="68"> 490    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 15.60 Collapse of northwestern overhang, resulting in the shown extant smooth vertical rock  faces of Panels A, D and E. Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. The rock mass from overhang collapse has greatest visibility at ground level on the northern  side of the site, whereas it is buried along the western side. This spatial patterning is due to the  variable quantities of collapsed material in different parts of the site. Along the western side, in  the areas of Squares B+E, only stratum D3 became detached from the overhang. In the area above  Square D, it is rock strata D3–D4 and D5a that fell, and here one part of that collapse is buried  (as revealed by the excavation) while the rest lies exposed on the surface. On the northern side of the site, it is the entire 2.7 m thickness of the overhang composed  of strata D4–D5–D6–D7 that fell. Here the lower strata (D4 and D5a) are buried under the  overlying strata (D5b–D6–D7) that are themselves visible on the surface as the tumble of blocks  just beyond the northern edge of the rock stack. The paintings of Panel A were made by climbing  onto those collapsed blocks. The upper surface of the pedestal (stratum D1; Figure 15.57) has been quarried for stone. Here,  evidence of stone flaking by percussion has resulted in the deposition of flaking debitage in the  adjacent sediments of Squares B+E, and Square D. We suggest that as people quarried the upper  stratum D1 surface, they further engaged with the site by removing collapsed blocks that must  once have laid on top of the exposed stratum D1 surface but that are now absent. These cultural  actions pre-date 4482 ± 20 BP (5041–5286 cal BP), a radiocarbon determination that came from  sediments overlying the level with the stratum D1 artefacts. The area surrounding the rock stack then became blanketed with aeolian sands. These sandy  sediments are more pronounced along the western side of the site, where the rock stack’s wall acts  as a protective screen from the wind; along the upwind southern and eastern sides, wind activity  has prevented effective sedimentation. We note that minor overhang collapse is evident during  the mid to late Holocene, as blocks are sometimes found buried amid the aeolian sediments  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="69"> 15.  Archaeology of JSARN–124 site 3, central-western Arnhem Land    491  of the upper sandy layer, and sometimes lie on the surface of the present ground surface. It is  during this phase of sand accumulation that the flaked slab that originated from the collapse of  the stratum D8 overhang was carried to its present location on top of aeolian sediments near  Square A under the eastern overhang.  Conclusion: How old is the large bird painting? Six lines of evidence inform us about the age of the large bird motif at JSARN-124 site 3: 1. The large bird motif is superimposed by a very thin, redeposited layer, protecting it from  weathering. Theoretically, the painting could thus be of considerable but indeterminate age. 2. The paint from the large bird motif lies immediately over a layer of gypsum. As gypsum  tends to mineralise under dry conditions, this may show the large bird was painted after  a dry phase. A dry phase during the LGM began to end c. 14,700 cal BP in northern  Australia (Reeves et al. 2013; Simon Haberle pers. comm. 2015), so the large bird motif is  likely to be of later date. 3. The large bird painting superimposes a 3MF hand stencil, currently thought to date to  less than c. 10,000–12,000 years old, so it is of that age if the estimated age of 3MF hand  stencils is correct. 4. A number of paintings on Panel A (Images #2, #5, #10, and possibly Images #1 and #14),  Panel B (Images #30 and #31), Panel C (Image #49, and possibly #45 and #46) and Panel E  (Images #56, #60, and possibly the degraded Image #58) are stylistically similar to each  other, and would thus appear to be contemporaneous (within an archaeological time frame)  (Figure 15.61). The large bird motif (Image #5) is one of these. What these paintings each  have in common is an overlapping combination of the following features, although not all  features are represented on all paintings: outlining without solid infilling; hollow body;  longitudinal line along full or partial length of body; transverse lines that divide the body  into separate sections (sometimes with the central section being further divided in half by  the longitudinal line); and hind legs infilled with longitudinal irregular ‘stripes’. Taçon  (1989, 1992) and Chaloupka (1993:183–185) have argued that the depiction of fauna with  hollow bodies such as found on bird Image #45 dates to the beginning of the Estuarine  period, around 8000 years ago. At JSARN-124 site 3, all of the above paintings from Panels  A, C and E must have been done sometime after 13,739–13,976 cal BP, as the rock surfaces  containing the whole of those panels formed sometime after that time. This conclusion is  consistent with Taçon’s and Chaloupka’s chronologies. 5. Under microscopic examination of cross-sections of rock samples, the pigment making the  large bird cannot be separated from that of the spear that intersects it, so the two motifs  are probably contemporaneous. Probably it is a picture of a bird being hunted with a spear,  rather than two separate images that chance to fall together. In short, the smooth, flat vertical rock surfaces of art Panels A, C, D and E all formed between  13,739–13,976 cal BP and 5041–5286 cal BP. The large bird motif is on Panel A, so it cannot be  older than 13,739–13,976 cal BP. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="70"> 492    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 15.61 Zoomorphs painted with shared artistic conventions, or similar and apparently shared  conventions, at JSARN–124 site 3. Source: Illustration by Robert Gunn and Bruno David. The fact that the large bird motif at JSARN–124 site 3 can now be shown to be more recent  than 13,739–13,976 cal BP highlights the tentative nature of a supposed widespread early phase  of ‘large naturalistic paintings’ that precedes the LGM and that can purportedly readily be  recognised by paintings such as the large bird motif across northern Australia–Southeast Asia  (e.g. Taçon and Chippindale 2008:75; Taçon et al. 2014), as has sometimes been argued. Last but not least, the large bird motif at JSARN-124 site 3 is superimposed over a 3MF hand  stencil on Panel A. That 3MF hand stencil also cannot possibly be older than 13,739–13,976 cal  BP, as the rock surface on which it occurs was only created at that time. As 3MF hand stencils  are generally associated with Dynamic Figures across western Arnhem Land, if the example from  JSARN–124 site 3 is contemporaneous with the other 3MF hand stencils of the region, and if  such hand stencils are indeed contemporaneous with Dynamic Figures as argued by all rock art  researchers who have researched the topic in Arnhem Land (e.g. Chaloupka 1993; Chippindale  and Taçon 1998; Lewis 1988; Taçon and Brockwell 1995), then we can conclude that the age of  Dynamic Figures began, or continued into, the period after 13,739–13,976 cal BP. In this context,  it is important to emphasise Chaloupka’s (1993:110) observation that ‘the 3MF stencil is unique  to the art of this period [Pre-Estuarine, to which Dynamic Figures belong]’. This inference is  consistent with Chippindale and Taçon (1998) and Taçon and Brockwell’s (1995) views that  Dynamic Figures date to around 10,000–12,000 years ago, contra Chaloupka’s (1993:89)  preference for a somewhat greater antiquity estimated to approach nearer to 20,000 years ago  (unless the style or set of related styles had a very long duration spanning some 10,000 years). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="71"> 15.
