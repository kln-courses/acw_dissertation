<plain_text><page sequence="1">VISUALITY AND ICONICITY IN SAMUEL BECKETT'S CATASTROPHE Sandra Wynands 1. Counter to Beckett's usual practice when dedicating his work to indi- viduals, Catastrophe is dedicated to someone whom Beckett did not know personally but who is both an eminent political figure and a fellow artist. It is dedicated to Vaclav Havel, and the occasion that prompted its composition was Havel's imprisonment in "socialist" Czechoslovakia for "subversive" political activities. This dedication is a significant and unusual gesture, and Catastrophe is hence most frequently read in a political context. It is concerned with and speaks out against the exploitation of human beings by their fellow humans in institutionalized contexts that disguise and legitimize exploita- tion - and by so doing, it defends human rights with silent eloquence in Beckett's trademark minimalist style. In a single condensed theatrical image at the end of the play, when the Protagonist raises his head and stares back at the audience, Beckett points towards everyone's complicity with such exploitative structures more effectively and memorably than the evanescent nature of wordy eloquence would have been able to: cruelty does not call for words but for action. l Typically, he also avoids the platitudes of polemics that political causes so often generate. This is precisely the point: in what form does a man whose deeply philo- sophical mind does not believe in the unmotivated singularity of horrific R&amp;L 37.3 (Autumn 2005) 81</page><page sequence="2">82 Religion &amp; Literature events react to the immediacy of a political cause? Bert States points to the first sentence of Murphy: "The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new" (1), a sentence that in many ways summarizes Beckett's artistic sensibility. It echoes, of course, Ecclesiastes 1 :9: "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun." Beckett tends to look for the existence of underlying unchanging structures that prompt atrocities in shifting manifestations throughout the history of humankind (a "human condition," as it were; a term so often used and abused in Beckett criticism). As was to be expected, Catastrophe is not a "topical play," analogous to the "topical song," i.e. churned out specifically in response to a specific political event and inevitably losing its bite and becoming unintelligible as soon as the circumstantial data have passed into oblivion. Even at the level of title {Play or Film illustrate the pattern) Beckett has a distinct tendency to turn his artistic statements into analyses of constitutive root problems: they transcend the specific and seek the universal. In the same way in which Film is a genre-exploration of film, exploring the visual mechanisms and philosophical assumptions at work in film-making and -watching, and by extension in Western epistemology in general, Catastrophe is about social and perceptual practices that underlie the perpetration of violence. Catastrophe "sees" at the base of the violence and humiliation to which the Protagonist is subjected structures of vision and visuality deeply engrained in Western culture, which enable and perpetuate dualistic thought. (It is useful to remember that "catastrophe" means "overturning" - maybe of a paradigm or an epistemology.) This is not to suggest that visual structures are by definition exploitative; Beckett with his great love for the visual arts would be the last one to agree to such a proposition. He often traveled great distances, in fact planned trips through entire continents, to stand in front of the paintings he loved and wished to see again. He was a staunch believer in the power of the visual image. To him the image has the advantage of immediacy over words and is therefore more readily able to overwhelm conceptual thought and leave the viewer speechless. In his homage to painter friend Jack Yeats he says, "In images of such breathless immediacy as these there is no occasion, no time given, no room left, for the lenitive of comment" [Disjecta 149). Rather, I want to suggest that Catastrophe criticizes dualistic practices of visuality as they occur predominantly in Western culture, perpetuated by the dominant Western philosophical and theological tradition. Catastrophe can then be read to hint at nondual ways of approaching the image that are shared by Christian and Buddhist negative theologies. I weave my argu- ment through the more widespread political readings of Catastrophe to show</page><page sequence="3">SANDRA WYNANDS 83 how such readings link up with a more general critique of representation. Then I will look at the power and exploitation that Catastrophe sees at work in the representational model of naturalist theatre and at the ways the play itself destabilizes this model. It is through these destabilizations that the play suggests nondual modes of presentation and perception, which can be illustrated with examples drawn from Buddhist and Christian negative theologies, namely Ch'an ink splash paintings and Byzantine iconography. Negative theologies have a vested interest in nonduality: our thinking about God becomes idolatrous as soon as it turns into a reification that objectifies God into an entity with (anthropomorphic) characteristics and properties. So negative theology will guard against reification of a "reality" which is by nature unobjectifiable. Byzantine icons are a case in point because even on the level of their material objectness they resist our objectifying gaze and dismantle the conventional dualism of observer and object, exerting instead a gaze of their own. However, it is a gaze that does not simply reverse the binary because it cannot be reduced to an essence, a being, an object or an entity of any kind. At this fundamental level of critique it matters little whether one tries to guard against the reification of a personal God or of our perception of the true nature of reality, so I will draw on Christian as well as Buddhist sources without claiming any analogy. This nondual rethinking of perception goes hand in hand with a rethink- ing of subjectivity: a constituting subject that objectifies the world of percep- tion is no adequate model. Here Jean-Luc Marion's refiguring of this model in terms of phenomenological givenness becomes important. Marion turns the Husserlian standard of the "poor phenomenon," according to which no given intuition can fulfill our intention of a phenomenon, on its head. He does not doubt that there are poor phenomena or common phenomena, which also mostly remain partially unfulfilled by intuition although adequa- tion is at least theoretically possible, but he refuses to accept them as the norm. Instead, he says, there are also phenomena that give themselves in excess of any intention, overflowing the intention and thus frustrating every attempt on the part of the subject to constitute them as phenomena. These he calls saturated phenomena. Under their sway the subject turns into what Marion calls "the gifted" - a receiver of a phenomenon that gives itself of its own accord. Finally, Marion's analysis of the saturated phenomenon links up with Beckett's criticism of an art of expression: the work of art as phenomenological intuition does not need to be measured against a previous intention to assess whether it adequately measures up to it and expresses it. It can give itself regardless of intention, its concentrated, minimalist form overflowing any intention. Beckett's ideal of expressionless art appears in</page><page sequence="4">84 Religion &amp; Literature a new light: it is not art utterly reduced in sensuous stimulus, but rather an art of reduction to givenness. 2. It is, of course, no accident that Beckett should locate his reflections on the visual paradigm in the arts, more particularly, in a theatre: a fictional as well as an actual one. For one thing, it saves the play from degenerating into mere finger-pointing. Instead of finding wrong with specific "alien" social practices such as politics or science, Beckett instead locates the "enemy" in the artists' own ranks within each individual. Appropriately, Havel's reply to Beckett, which came in the form of a naturalist play called Mistake, is about prisoners building within the prison walls a social order based upon the same principles that oppressed them outside. Thus, it obviously picks up on the same thought: individuals are the victims of their own practices, not of an outside force. Moreover, simply saying that science and politics are based on dualistic thought and exploitation would not only have been stating the obvious, it would also have been uncharacteristically reductive. As it is, the unavoidable undercurrent of the play is that art shares with science its basic assumptions, its fundamental dualism and, hence, its ex- ploitative nature. The Director in Catastrophe does not tire of concocting ever new, ever more degrading poses for his Protagonist, whose shivering, half-naked, deformed body is exposed on a pedestal to the voyeuristic gaze of the theatre audience for the latter's entertainment and intellectual stimulation. As is often the case, the over-eager Assistant, keen to earn her laurels and to make her way ahead by hook or by crook (and, in this case, by unbearable sycophancy), is willing even to overstep the rules of the game as they are: more than once the Director has to call her back from imposing a further humiliation on the Protagonist and to admonish her to merely "[s]ay it" (SP 297) - to stay confined to representation in language instead of insisting on the real thing. Such an analysis of the dynamics of theatrical production work has to have consequences for - or will conceivably even spring from - Beckett's reflec- tions on his own directorial work in the theatre. Beckett had the reputation of being a perfectionist who would not let things rest until he had produced an image on stage that corresponded to his own vision in minute detail, and he often pushed actors to the end of their tethers in trying to make them conform to this vision. The circumstances in which Not /, for instance, came into being gives special relevance to the questions Catastrophe raises. Not /, being kenotic, is far from trying to conceive of a conceptual image of catastrophe or otherwise. But even though it does not set out to produce a</page><page sequence="5">SANDRA WYNANDS 85 representation of (human) misery for a theatre audience's "entertainment," the apparatus into which the actress's body has to be strapped for the dura- tion of the play nonetheless inflicts very real physical pain and emotional distress. Both Jessica Tandy, who premiered the play in New York, and Billie Whitelaw reported their discomfort. Whitelaw states that she would never do the play again for fear of losing her sanity (Gussow 88). For her, playing Mouth is "a terrible inner scream, like falling backwards into hell" (85) and, according to Linda Ben-Zvi (24), she was taken aback at her interlocutors' obvious insensitivity to her pain when friends suggested after watching Not /in the theatre that it was impossible to tell whether the mouth was real or recorded. In Catastrophe, then, Beckett "links the theme of human victimization to the paradox of theatre preparing unpleasant subjects for the pleasure of an audience," Bert States summarizes (14). An old dilemma opens up - one that Theodor Adorno famously expressed in his statement to Paul Celan, that writing poetry after Auschwitz was barbaric.2 A representation of ho- locaust atrocities can never give adequate expression to the inconceivable and inexpressible horror that was a daily reality in the concentration camps. By the mere fact of being a representation it will have to fall short of life itself, which knows no curtain and no suspension of disbelief. In fact, by making the atrocities part of an (inevitably) aestheticized representation, the artist robs them of their singularity by repeating them (in an aesthetic realm) and, in the process, bestows upon them a certain legitimation: the cruelty and the pain are no longer unspeakable, and what can be signified in language is, at least in principle, repeatable because it falls within the limits of human conception. The degree of critical distance with which an artist approaches his or her topic does not change this basic mechanism. Beckett, too, has an inherent mistrust of language and its capacity to ex- press concepts or authorial intention. His equally strong belief in language's inadequacy - yet also in what he calls the artist's obligation to express - and his conviction that expression itself needs to be overcome (cf. "Three Dia- logues"), will become relevant later on. For the moment, suffice to note his acute awareness of the failure of language to render the experience of reality adequately - a problem that has a strong moral dimension when that experi- ence is one of calamity, cruelty, or catastrophe: "If you really get down to the disaster, the slightest eloquence becomes unbearable. Whatever is said is so far from experience. [. . .] There is a danger of rising up into rhetoric. Speak it even and pride comes. Words are a form of complacency" (Beckett qtd. in Harvey 249-50). Again, according to Beckett, the fictional director and his assistant, as much as the real one and the real audience, take part in the complacent legitimation of violence a la Adorno.</page><page sequence="6">86 Religion &amp; Literature Yet Beckett's critique of representation in Catastrophe is more far-reaching than this because it is not concerned exclusively with the representation of violence. Rather, the play seems to suggest that there is a gap between experience and its representation that makes the artist himself or herself a likely perpetrator of violence because representation itselfis violence. Beckett locates the core of the issue in the exploitative gaze that is enabled by the dualistic split inherent in representation itself. The structures of enframing and instrumentality this split brings with it are violence: the Holocaust, the world-wars and environmental destruction all bear witness to it. Vi- sion as an epistemological tool has claimed an exalted position in Western metaphysics. Vision is the least "embodied" of the senses. For Hegel, for example, sight, together with hearing, is one of the "theoretical senses," which enable a relation of what is externally present to rational intelligence (Hegel 38). Hegel thinks that the other senses, by contrast, present objects in their specific sensuous individuality, which appeals to desire rather than to rationality. David Levin surmises "that the thrust of Heidegger's critique of meta- physics brings forth serious questions regarding the complicity of vision - vi- sion elevated to the position of paradigm for knowledge and rationality - in the historical domination of our "'universal' metaphysics" (Levin 7). One might conclude that every effort to deconstruct metaphysics has to contend to some extent with visuality, as Beckett has clearly understood. To illustrate the predatory tendency of vision, Paul Virilio evokes a photo-report in a fashion magazine in which an elegantly attired 'beauty queen' is filmed running through the ruin of Sarajevo among stoved-in cars, imitating the fatal flight of the town's inhabitants as snip- ers open fire on them. The sight line of the fashion photographer then becomes completely indistinguishable from that of the assassin lying in wait. It is his solitary excitement we are invited to share. (Virilio 1995: 19) And Levin concludes, as if in conversation with Virilio, with the perfect summary of Catastrophe: "Observation has become cruelty. Obsessed with the picture, the image, we take part, whether willingly or unwillingly, in the production of suffering" (194). Thus, it is of secondary importance that the Director and the Assistant in Catastrophe want explicitly to construct an im- age of misery - this is, as it were, merely as far as Beckett is willing to go in order to make a (polemical) point. In fact, any image they could construct would participate in an economy of violence. Later in his career, Beckett completely abandons representational models of adequation. For him the aim cannot be an adequation between intention and intuition, or a Vorstellung and the thing itself. Such a model will always</page><page sequence="7">SANDRA WYNANDS 87 be based on a dualism between signification and fulfillment. Instead, Beck- ett turns away from mimetic models and models of adequation to an art of Darstellung or immediate sense presentation. The Jena Romantics were still sustained by a belief in the unity and power of the imagination that would be capable of rendering, darstellen, the artist's vision once it had been freed from the chains of mimetic representation. This is a trust Beckett, as a postmodern, can no longer have. In this radical turn towards Darstellung he tries to avoid the expression of any previous interiority of Vorstellung. Or, inversely, he tries to avoid the process of measuring the work of art against a preceding intention. Instead, it is to give itself in and of itself as a saturated phenomenon: the truth of the artwork is not measured in terms of (at best) adequation to an intention, but overflows it. Beckett begins to create saturated phenomena of the theatre. 3. Catastrophe links the dualism that is inherent in representation to the visual as the ground of our acts of knowing. Especially during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment the visual advanced from being the most eminent sense among several, which it had been through most of Western history, to becoming the very paradigm of truth. We are now hardly aware of the extent to which the visual paradigm has infiltrated everyday language: visual metaphors abound. And at least since Plato's famous cave allegory the visual paradigm is, moreover, linked most directly to the dualist struc- tures of representation. It is true that in the cave allegory visuality figures prominently as a source of deception rather than illumination, and one will have to conclude that "Greek culture was not as univocally inclined towards celebrating vision as may appear at first glance" (Jay 28). Martin Jay suggests that, nevertheless, "it must still be acknowledged that Hellenic thought did on the whole privilege the visual over any other sense. Even in its negative guises, its power was evident" (29). Greek culture was dominated by a metaphysics of light which passed on from there into a full-fledged mysticism of light in the Middle Ages and onwards. In "On the Reduction of the Arts to Theology," St. Bonaventure, for example, equates light with truth and knowledge: God is the source of all light and, therefore, of truth. His light radiates throughout the world and creation participates in truth to the extent that it reflects the light. The crucial moment in the history of visuality in the Western world is, of course, the development of perspective in visual representation during the Italian Renaissance - "one of the most fateful innovations in Western culture" (Jay 44). With the help of the rules laid out in Alberti's De Pittura,</page><page sequence="8">88 Religion &amp; Literature three-dimensional, rationalized space could be rendered on - "translated" to, it seemed - a two-dimensional surface. For this analytical gaze, that of Beckett's Director and Assistant, to be possible, the visible has to become the object of ratio, a meaningless, observable object to be manipulated, not the divine allegory of the Middle Ages in which everything is charged with meaning and human beings are intimately involved in a narrative unfolding all around them. The observer has to perceive herself as a distinct and sepa- rate subject looking at an object from a single fixed point of view, replacing the multiple vantage points one associates with the Middle Ages, so that it becomes possible to render the picture internally consistent. As a result, perspectivalism not only renders a given object from one specific vantage point but also prescribes this vantage point for the viewer. Thus, any act of viewing will involve two symmetrical pyramids, or rather, as Jay puts it, "a mirror intersecting one pyramid, which then reflected that pyramid's apex back in the other direction" (54). One apex is the viewer's eye, the other the point of convergence of the flight lines in the picture while the picture itself acts as the mirror. Especially the painted perspectival flats that were used in stage design in the 19th century (and which provoked Adolphe Appia's scorn because of their tendency to clash with the actual three-dimensionality of the actors and real objects on stage) reveal the extent to which theatre conformed to the regime of the monocular apex: the invisible fourth wall of the proscenium becomes the mirror. The structure of the inverted pyramid becomes especially important with Descartes who "tacitly adopted the position of the perspectivalist painter using a camera obscura" (Jay 69). In this way, he is able to posit the radi- cal split between self-reflexive subject and independent object that ushers in modernity. Because the subject is certain only of its own existence as a self-referential entity, the outside world must inevitably be envisioned as a separate phenomenon altogether, of which the subject can nonetheless gain true knowledge. In fact, the Cogito's self-certainty and self-identity is the only possible foundation of truth. This establishes the most far-reaching and fateful dualism in Western philosophy, and elevates the scientific gaze and the narcissistic mirror image inherent in identitarian reflexivity to an epistemological paradigm. In Catastrophe Beckett points out to an excessively self-conscious audi- ence the extent to which the exploitative gaze of voyeurism operates. Yet instead of focusing on Beckett's critique of the visual paradigm in theatre directly, as Sartrean analyses in particular will do, coming to it through the back door of representation emphasizes the scope of Catastrophe's critique of representation all the way back to Plato. Western theories of the theatre and of art in general find their most fundamental and devastating reference</page><page sequence="9">SANDRA WYNANDS 89 point in Plato's critique of mimesis, and even in the Theatre of the Real, or the Now - theatrical movements that aim deliberately at overcoming mimetic constraints - theatre does not so much overcome its limitations as meet them: "face to face with its double, the thing it can never be" (States 21). For however much theatre will try to overcome representation, it will not overcome the difference between the staged act and life itself: a real chair in the context of a performance will always be a chair playing a chair. Even shamanistic ritual, invoked frequently over the past twenty years or so as a way of tapping into some primordial, universal source of energy that will make theatre immediately experiential, is defined by the fact that it occurs in an controlled environment removed from the unpredictability of life itself, which enables the shaman to channel supernatural or cosmic energy in order to use it towards specific ends. Hence it seems that Beckett's aim with a provocative critique like Ca- tastrophe cannot be to urge audiences and theatre practitioners to overcome representation. Any attempt to "overcome" achieves nothing because it establishes a dualism between itself and what it set out to overcome. So, maybe it is not a matter of overcoming, but of bringing a different, nondual awareness to the old. Nonduality is not representation's Other. Rather, it is the nature of nonduality not to enter into binary constellations with other terms, otherwise it would not be nondual. This means that the non-con- ceptuality of any nondual non-concept, such as the Buddhist sunyata, has to be rigorous: it cannot be thought of as something that operates outside of conceptuality or language since this very movement would imply reification. As Masao Abe puts it, simply and succinctly: ...Shunyata is entirely unobjectifiable and unconceptualizable.[...] Accordingly, if Shunyata is conceived somewhere outside one's self-existence it is not true Shunyata any longer because Shunyata conceived outside one's existence turns into something represented and called by oneself 'Shunyata.' (Abe 20) For the same reason, it is impossible to say whether something, for example language, is by nature either dual or nondual. One cannot call language inherently dualist (because it consists of the dualist building blocks of sub- ject and predicate) and then want to catapult oneself somewhere outside language where non-concepts no longer run the risk of being sucked back into logocentric thought. But it is equally logocentric to postulate as the logical alternative remaining within language's system of differences (as Derrida does). Such a solution does not avoid reification, as it sets out to do, but rather stays with a valorization of difference: having successfully deconstructed identity, it then fails to deconstruct its opposite.3</page><page sequence="10">90 Religion &amp; Literature Rather, language is both dual and nondual, and will show itself concep- tually or non-conceptually, according to the way it is grasped. Nagarjuna uses the example of a snake ineptly handled to illustrate this point: rightly grasped, the snake (of language) will be harmless, while it can be lethal when approached with a dualist, everyday, mind. Nagarjuna calls incurable those who will turn even nonduality - sunyata - into a concept. From the Buddhist perspective, mind, at the relative, conceptual, representational level, is thus confronted with two truths: "that of a personal everyday world and a higher one which surpasses it" (Loy "Deconstruction" 239) where the higher truth is sunya, empty - empty not in the sense of European nihilism, but emptied of limiting conceptualizations to become open for what at the relative level would be called the "impossible." Loy fruitfully attempts to translate as follows: "[sunya and sunyata] derive from the Sanskrit root su9 which means 'to be swollen,' both like a hollow balloon and like a pregnant woman; therefore the usual English translation 'empty' and 'emptiness' must be supplemented with the notion of 'pregnant with possibilities'" (Loy "Deconstruction" 233). This higher truth is not situated elsewhere, in a transcendent realm beyond this world, but within it, and unfolds, as it were, as soon as we stop looking for the transcendent, or for the groundbreaking paradigm shift that changes everything. Otherwise our very efforts to "solve the problem" are precisely what maintain the problem. There are "two truths," then, only from the conceptual, representational point of view. The higher one precisely undoes the opposition, but it cannot be known purely discursively. "Perhaps this is what we always sought," Loy summarizes provocatively, "not to become real, but to realize that we don't need to become real" ("Deconstruction" 246). Nagarjuna's seventh-century commentator Candrakirti glosses this point thus: "The very coming to rest, the non-functioning of perceptions as signs of all named things, is itself nirvana" (262).4 The core of the prob- lem, then, is once again linked to structures of visuality: signs are used to objectify appearances into self-existing things of which a person's fragile ego-identity is one. As soon as this process ceases, the disconcerting paradox of our awareness, of our own mortality, also disappears. By this I mean the paradox of our sense of being caught in an irreversible time stream which we locate outside of ourselves and our clashing perception of ourselves as self-existing units. More than any other medium of representation, the theatre depends upon dualist structures of visuality: the theatrical performance is defined by an audience looking at actors in a more or less scenic presentation that unfolds before them. At the height of the naturalist proscenium stage dur- ing the first half of the twentieth century (admittedly an atypical chapter</page><page sequence="11">SANDRA WYNANDS 9 1 in theatre history), actors were expected not to acknowledge the audience's existence at all - a practice which intensifies the impression of being involved in a voyeuristic activity complete with the power-dynamic inherent in it: staring through the ubiquitous translucent fourth wall into the privacy of somebody else's living-room, objectifying what one sees there. This dynamic has to be broken in order to push the play, and representation, beyond its frame. Theatrical experiments other than the naturalist grant the actor far greater agency in reacting to the audience's gaze. But given that, despite its stylization, Catastrophe, more than any other of Beckett's plays, functions within a semblance of naturalism (and evokes it even though it transgresses it), it does not seem polemical to compare the play with what is otherwise Beckett's diametrical opposite. The destabilization of this one-sidedness occurs when the Protagonist returns the audience's gaze. Like Sartre's voyeur who hears the rustling of the bush behind him, the audience is suddenly thrown back upon itself and becomes aware - in the few stubborn cases when the penny has not yet dropped - of its own exploitative collaboration with the Director and Assistant. Most importantly, though, the play's fictional frame of reference is broken and switches from the fictional setting of the theatrical rehearsal to the actual act of performance, from the representation to the real.5 Or rather, from the (fictional) real of rehearsal (involving actors playing actors) to the actual performance (with characters in a Beckett play): the play within the play is the real (rehearsal rather than play) and the live performance is, in fact, a representation - an intriguing chiasmus. Catastrophe enters into an intricate, self-referential feedback loop that makes an unambiguous position impossible. The spectator of Beckett's play finds herself in a double bind. To clap one's hands at the end of Beckett's play to a certain extent means to applaud the very exploitation that the fictional audience (whose canned expressions of "transports of joy" are presented to the read audience like a mirror) applauded like a flock of mindless sheep. For while Catastrophe's point is precisely the critique of this mechanism, the play's final moments point out that it does not escape it itself. The Protagonist's very act of resistance, the real catastrophe which transgresses the rules of theatrical etiquette and happens outside of the fictional director's control, is what is staged for the real audience night after night, thus being sucked back into the economy of exploitation. Yet this is only true to a limited extent because the Protagonist's stare also produces for the real audience in the theatre a kind of Brechtian alienation effect, so that, from this moment on, the awakened, cigar-smoking, critically distanced audience is acutely aware of the play's - any play's - two levels of reality, the fictional and the actual, the real and the image.6 As a result,</page><page sequence="12">92 Religion &amp; Literature the spectator of Catastrophe simultaneously sees at the moment of the play's climax the character in the fictional director's play, Beckett's play, and the actor on stage - whom she meets on a par, as in a Brechtian Lehrstiick. In this moment of insight, when the actor momentarily steps out of his role to face the audience in the real theatre, the relationship between the actor/char- acter in Beckett's play and the spectator is one of equality and reciprocity in which both, together with the playwright, assure one another of their common understanding. Further self-referential instabilities open up when one reminds oneself of the extent to which Catastrophe plays with the assumptions of naturalism. After all, naturalism as a theatrical movement arose as a reaction to theatri- cal conventions of representation that were perceived as artificial, stilted, or foreign to the theatrical medium. What naturalism aimed to achieve was to break through petrified structures of representation and to reproduce life itself. The everyday existence of physical beings was to be put on stage. What naturalism ended up producing on stage was, of course, not life, but a representation thereof. At least the beginning of Catastrophe is situated squarely within the naturalist tradition, although the stylized, repetitive idiom ("I make a note") already signals some ironic distance from it. Catas- trophe puts on stage the stuff that life in the theatre is made of: a rehearsal. It offers a voyeuristic peek behind the scenes of theatrical illusion. It shows that illusion in the making; in other words, it shows not the illusion but life. It is part of the game of confusion Catastrophe plays with the spectator that in this logic even the "bare stage" (SP 297), so unlikely in naturalism, can be seen as a naturalistic rendering of an avant-garde play in the process of be- ing staged. In fact, Catastrophe takes naturalism at its word by incorporating as "actors" a real theatre audience and a real theatre, not adding the fourth wall but rather removing the remaining three: it is more real than natural- ism ever was, although it does precisely what naturalism set out to do, and in this gesture oversteps the conventions of its model. The confusions that arise from conflations of the real and the fictional situate Catastrophe beyond the confines of naturalist convention. By the end of the play, Catastrophe has moved from a realistic context ({' Rehearsal. Final touches to the last scene" [SP 297]) to an abstract space that finds the stage in complete darkness, save an illuminated bodiless head floating in space. But while the play thwarts precisely the expectation of showing the real thing - the finished artistic product (a naturalist play), by showing a rehearsal - it still shows the finished product: a new play by acclaimed Nobel Prize winning genius Samuel Beck- ett. Thus in the final analysis the audience is free to reinstate what Derrida calls transcendental signifieds against Beckett's explicit intention.</page><page sequence="13">SANDRA WYNANDS 93 All these mechanisms contribute to a process of destabilization completed in the Protagonist's return of the gaze that makes any stable one-sided view- ing impossible. Instead, what is instigated is, as Barbara Freedman puts it, a "fractured reciprocity, whereby beholder and beheld reverse position in a way that renders a steady position of spectatorship impossible" (1). For Freedman, the deflection of the gaze is an important strategy in disrupting frames of representation. Innovative approaches to solving the problem of representation can be seen at work in various genres. It is worth dwelling on two seemingly dispa- rate examples from the realm of the visual arts, Byzantine iconography and Buddhist ink-splash painting, because they link up directly with the return of the gaze and hence are relevant to the structures of visuality Beckett explores in Catastrophe. Finally, the two examples will emerge as not at all disparate. Byzantine iconography faces the difficulty of "presenting" for the believ- er's veneration an image of the transcendent divinity that stays clear of the pitfalls of idolatry. In other words, the icon must not be a mere representa- tion, because this would situate the divine in the realm of what is humanly conceivable, and the Eastern Church insists above all on the unknowability of God. Iconography solves this problem by what modernity has come to call "reverse perspective," but which is in fact the only possible and logical perspective from the Byzantine point of view. Byzantine icons lack depth: there is no simulated third dimension in the form of flight lines converging in the back of the picture. Instead, the viewer is confronted with a wall of gold or, more modestly, ochre, that deflects the human gaze. Jean Paris puts into words a radical conclusion that must be drawn from this: If there is no depth in Byzantine mosaics, if the divine space prevents our intrusion by opposing a dazzling wall of gold to our own 'regard', as a supernatural frontier which reveals and at the same time forbids the absolute infinity of the Being, clearly the third dimension is not to be found in the background of the image, but in front of it, protruding straightforward as the very Regard of Transcendence itself: we are the third dimension, we are the picture. (39) This radical reversal is emphasized by the gaze of Christ or the theotokos directed at the viewer in a direct line. In their purest form even depictions of the theotokos with the child show both looking not at each other, but at the viewer, with the theotokos standing upright and Christ oddly suspended in space in front of her (cf. Paris: "Right from the beginning, the Virgin Mary obeys the same canons as her husband and son" [43]), while depic- tions that are influenced by the profane space of the Italian Renaissance, i.e. by our human-centred relation to the image, tend to humanize the iconic</page><page sequence="14">94 Religion &amp; Literature space by seating the theotokos and emotionalizing the setting by having her exchange loving glances with her child (43). The icon generally known as the "Mother of God of the Sign" is a pure representative of the first style, while the "Mother of God of Tenderness," and even the Vladimir Icon of Constantinople, are examples of the second. In Byzantine iconography, then, the image does the looking: the unknow- able God, infinitely beyond human conception and not to be constituted by a transcendental ego that is in Western culture virtually synonymous with the monocular eye/I, gazes upon his creation, literally his image and like- ness: the congregation in church. To emphasize this point, icons that depict biblical scenes will sometimes have flight lines that converge on the viewer rather than away from her - a practice that has a profoundly destabilizing effect on the viewing experience: the image resists being seen, as it were, by persistently coming at the viewer instead of presenting itself complacently for consumption. Or else multiple perspectives or viewpoints will clash in the same image, producing a similarly confusing effect for the viewer by giving her no stable position from which to survey the scene in its entirety. The Byzantine icon thus constitutes an intriguing parallel to the situation on Beckett's stage at the end of Catastrophe, In both cases the gaze emanates from what would conventionally be called the "image," destabilizing the distinction between reality and its representation. Both do so from a space that does not comply with the usual Western viewing habits. Like the icon, Beckett's play has moved from a naturalist presentation that conforms to the parameters of Enlightenment vision to an abstract space presenting "a face freed from its moorings, floating as visual emblem in the stage's obscurity" (Garner 64), given to impenetrable surrounding darkness. Both appeal to dimensions other than the conventional three, manifesting those by stretching representation to its limits. It will now become apparent how we can extend this parallel further. Along the lines of the Brechtian alienation effect the Protagonist turns from being a fictional character to being a human being acting in a play at the moment the representational logic of the play is disrupted and the char- acter stares back at the audience. The play then takes full advantage of an ambivalent co-existence of the real and the fictional in any theatrical space. The two always exist simultaneously in the theatre and the Protagonist's stare simply allows the real to emerge momentarily from behind the image. At this very moment the image becomes iconic in Jean-Luc Marion's typology of saturated phenomena. Marion develops an ascending typology of saturated phenomena that starts with the event, continues with the idol, the flesh, the icon, and culmi- nates in a super-phenomenon - the phenomenon of revelation. Each one is</page><page sequence="15">SANDRA WYNANDS 95 saturated according to one of the Kantian categories and the phenomenon of revelation is saturated in all categories at once. The event is saturated according to quantity (since it is impossible to take in its entirety from any single vantage point), the idol is saturated according to quality (it bedazzles); the flesh according to relation (it is a kind of "auto-affective" phenomenon, since in sensation there is no difference between, say, what is heard and the hearing); and, finally, the icon is saturated according to modality (since the I no longer defines its possibility or existence). The second and fourth phenomena are especially interesting because, like the stage image in Catastrophe, one can flip over into the other. According to the typology a painting, or, in the case of Beckett's play, the stage image, is an idol because it keeps all its concentrated visuality, all the bedazzlement it generates, "to itself." The icon's glory, however, comes to it from outside it: the real glory is the saintly prototype that cannot be represented, but rather is presented in the icon. The idol, on the contrary, also presents, but it presents nothing other than itself. So at the moment when the ambivalence between the imaginary and the real comes fully into play in Catastrophe, or when the actor emerges perceiv- ably from behind the mask of character, the image moves from being idola- trous to being iconic, or differently put, it moves from giving itself as visual spectacle to exerting its own gaze and offering no spectacle whatsoever: the icon "tolerates no gaze" (Marion Crossing 232). Marion includes the face of the Other among the saturated phenomena he calls iconic, although he is careful to point out that what is implied here is not solely or even primarily an ethical obligation to the Other a la Levinas. Levinas foregrounds the boundlessness of one's ethical obligation to the other absolutely, and only from the absoluteness of that pre-phenomenal relationship does he derive a mechanism that "brings God to mind."7 For Marion, on the other hand, any icon, whether human or wooden, is automatically in continuity with the divine. As he says in God without Being, "...what characterizes the icon painted on wood does not come from the hand of a man but from the infinite depth that crosses it [...]. The essential in the icon - the intention that envisages - comes to it from elsewhere" (21). The icon will always try to make the invisible visible, and it will do so according to a logic that is not mimetic. With this we turn towards iconography again. The icon does not attempt to represent Christ or the Saints. Its austere lines and aesthetic asceticism leave no question about that. It aims rather higher: it wants to present divinity. "The icon steps outside the mimetic logic of the image by what it accomplishes entirely in its reference to a prototype" (Marion Crossing 78).</page><page sequence="16">96 Religion &amp; Literature St. Theodore the Studite, one of the foremost defenders of icons of the 9th century, is able to clarify precisely what Marion means by this. For St. Theodore the icon and the divine or saintly prototype to which it refers do not belong to two different orders, such as image and original would in the logic of mimesis, but to the order of related things. An icon is different from its prototype in quantity, but not in quality. Here is St. Theodore: The prototype and the image belong to the category of related things, like the double and the half. For the prototype always implies the image of which it is the prototype, and the double always implies the half in relation to which it is called double. For there would not be a prototype if there were no image; there would not even be any double, if some half were not understood. But since these things exist simultane- ously, they are understood and subsist together. Therefore, since no time intervenes between them, the one does not have a different veneration from the other, but both have one and the same. (Theodore 1 1 0) There would be no image without the prototype, St. Theodore predictably tells us, but also, more surprisingly, no prototype without the image. There is no original and copy; rather, the "image" and "original" are simultaneous. The two are in a categorical relationship of interdependence; one cannot ex- ist without the other, thus one does not precede the other in a relationship of ontological primacy, although the two are in ontological interdependence. Now we can say more about what attracts Beckett to the theatre, especially in his late art when he turns towards the theatre for what prose can only realize imperfectly. Like the painting or the icon, and unlike language, which inevitably moves along a temporal axis, the theatrical image is able to give itself all at once. This is especially true of Beckett's late stage images, which literally become paintings strangely disturbed by minimal motion: action is reduced to a minimum. In other words, the visual more easily reaches the critical threshold of phenomenal saturation than does prose. At the same time, however, the theatre foregrounds in a more immediately experiential manner the same ambivalence that Blanchot takes to characterize the space of literature in general: theatre, like the Byzantine icon, always gives the real and the imaginary at the same time, because the physicality of the ac- tor, or the phenomenological givenness of a chair as chair, rather than as stage prop, never recedes entirely behind the fictional context of the play. The difference is that the icon presupposes the divine prototype whereas the space of literature in the manifestation it takes with Beckett does not, although it does not deny it, either. Rather, it achieves a similarly irreducible iconicity in the horizontal realm of the text.</page><page sequence="17">SANDRA WYNANDS 97 So it is an iconic structure that Beckett looks for in his endeavors to create an expressionless art, an art that is "[t]he expression that there is nothing to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express" ("Dialogues" 139). As we established earlier, it is not enough to situate oneself in some hypothetical space outside expression. What is needed is an iconic space that is both inside and outside and that does not adhere to the binary logic of representation. The most pervasive characteristic of Beckett's art is probably his frustra- tion, and fascination, with the limits of language, with representation and the ineffable. In an early German letter to a publisher who tried to win Beckett's multilingual talents for a translation of Ringelnatz into English, Beckett wrote as a damper to Axel Kaun's enthusiasm: I find it increasingly difficult, indeed increasingly pointless, to write an official English. My own language seems to me more and more like a veil that needs to be torn in order to get at the things (or the Nothingness) behind it. [translation mine. "Es wird mir tatsachlich immer schwieriger, ja sinnloser ein offizielles Englisch zu schreiben. Und immer mehr wie ein Schleier kommt mir meine Sprache vor, den man zerreissen muss, um an die dahinterliegeden Dinge (oder das dahinterliegende Nichts) zu kommen" (Disjecta 52)]. What Beckett keeps of this attitude throughout his writing life is the hope reflected here of a transcendent elsewhere that will reveal things for what they are (be that a plenitude or nothing at all - he won't commit himself); what he questions is the method of arriving there by any mode of adequa- tion. Beckett's skepticism works both ways, in the form of a mistrust of mimesis and of Vorstellung. In order to be freed from the dualist shackles of representation one needs to keep the Romantic belief in Darstellung, for sure, but once the Darstellung "returns" to the artist as phenomenological intuition, the criterion of its truth must not be whether it conforms to a preceding Vorstellung of it. It must no longer be the subject that "assembles" what it finds to conform to its Vorstellung. It is an art of radical presentation that calls for a fundamentally different conception of subjectivity, since the traditional centred, self-grounded subject or transcendental ego is markedly unfit both to create and to receive such art. Indeed, it calls for a nondual way of creating art and inhabiting the world. The example of Chinese ink- splash painting will clarify the implications. A relatively recent article by Junko Matoba explicitly links sunyata to Beckett's visual style in his late drama (Matoba). Matoba isolates darkness and decentring as the most important characteristics in Japanese mono- chrome painting and identifies the darkened area on Beckett's stage with</page><page sequence="18">98 Religion &amp; Literature the empty white space in Japanese ink paintings and thereby with sunyata. But in her conclusion she remains both loyal to dualism and to the estab- lished currents of Beckett criticism. She concludes: "The religious notion of nothing in Yohaku [the empty white space in Japanese ink painting] is positive, whereas Beckett's is a 'dung-heap' accumulated from an agnostic stance for neither the positive nor the negative" (Matoba 40; interpolation mine). Norman Bryson, in a short essay entitled "The Gaze in the Expanded Field" (1988), offers a much more compelling account of the philosophical implications of Ch'an ink-splash paintings that will elucidate at greater depth why the parallels with Beckett's art are so compelling. Bryson establishes first of all that in order to overcome representation in painting the object needs to be lifted out of the frame. The frame fixes the point of view from which the object is depicted, prescribes a point of view for the viewer and at the same time wants to evoke the impression of showing the object in its entirety, when this is clearly impossible: a cube can never be shown fully on a canvas, and yet we state without hesitation that we are in fact seeing a cube. Instead, Bryson suggests, the object needs to be placed "on the expanded field of blankness or sunyata" so that "[t]he object opens out omnidirection- ally on to universal surround, against which it defines itself negatively and diacritically" (100). He finds this "expanded field" at work in Ch'an paint- ing - a discipline that arises directly from its practitioners' (normally monks,) full immersion in the "concept" of sunyata - and he specifically discusses a landscape by Sesshu, whom Matoba also uses as an example, and who worked in China in the second half of the 1 5th century: When we look at things, we do see only a tangent, and not the full radiation of light emitted omnidirectionally. Ch'an does not dispute that. What Ch'an does dispute is that the profile which thus appears can be identified with the object itself. [. . .] What the image needs to include is the fact of the object's remainder, the other views which pass out from the object to all those uncountable places where the viewer is not.... (Bryson 103) It includes this by virtue of sunyata (which "inhabits" the empty space in the painting) and does so in the following way. The paintings, produced by accomplished Buddhist monks, emerge from a practice of meditation and an integrated way of life whose "aim" it is to transcend the dualist ev- eryday perception of the world into a nondual one. Through a regime of concentration, contemplation and meditation that is to help the practitioner detach herself from self and thought, the practitioner attunes herself to a universal orderedness, so that a merging takes place between the meditat- ing subject and the outside world. The meditation practice is intended to</page><page sequence="19">SANDRA WYNANDS 99 tire the conceptual mind, especially through the use of koans, contradictory "riddles" without solution, that make the mind spin between the conceptual possibilities until it comes to rest and lets go of habitual binary thought patterns. Nagarjuna might be the most rigorous logician among mystics: according to him any assertion can take four possible forms: "(1) that it is; (2) that it is not; (3) that it both-is-and-is-not; (4) that it neither-is-nor-is-not" (Sprung 7). This four-fold figure exhausts the ontological implications of the verb "to be." The "result" of this process (though, as with Derrida, one must be careful not to reify it into a "method") is sunyata. Consequently, when the practitioner flings ink onto the canvas, what emerges is not the result of random chance, nor obviously the intention of the artist, but a manifestation of that universal order: the picture is witness to the practitioner's own "being in the world," which is in turn tuned to the universal order. Thus the artist's intuition in creation is not merely a func- tion of individual subjectivity. Artists commonly describe such moments of creation as inspired by God in which they were merely the executive organs, a widespread metaphor in Western culture to describe the nondual mo- ment, David Loy suggests (Nonduality 153). Bryson evocatively summarizes the process thus: The flinging of ink marks the surrender of the fixed form of the image to the global configuration of force that subtends it. Eidos is scattered to the four winds. The image is made to float on the forces which lie outside the frame; it is thrown, as one throws dice. What breaks into the image is the rest of the universe, everything outside the frame. (Bryson 103) Life itself enters into the picture, but not because it is the more authentic cousin of representation and hence to be preferred to the weak copy, but be- cause life is the image; nirvana is samsara, as was suggested by Loy earlier. With Chinese ink-splash paintings and also with Byzantine iconography (which allows for artistic individuality only within the narrow historical bounds of the type), we have found examples of artistic production that go beyond subject-centred models of artistic expression. So what happens to the audience in Beckett's plays; or, more narrowly put, what happens to the "subject" once the artist has created and the work of art comes flooding back as intuition? Jean-Luc Marion re-thinks the post-Husserlian subject as "the gifted" - a "receiver" who does not constitute the phenomenon, but rather submits to its givenness, "lights up as on a control panel," {Given 2 1 7) as Marion says, when the phenomenal information hits it, and turns it into manifestation. Likewise, he refigures the Husserlian standard of the "poor" phenomenon. He does not doubt that there are such phenomena whose intuition can never fulfill the subject's intention, but intention is no longer</page><page sequence="20">100 Religion &amp; Literature the defining moment of phenomenological cognition. It is givenness, and he can therefore allow for other phenomena as well, namely phenomena that exceed intention: "saturated phenomena" or paradoxes, as he also calls them, that send the receiver into endless hermeneutic loops of trying, unsuccessfully, to constitute the phenomenon. Beckett spent hours in front of the Decollation of St. John the Baptist in the cathedral in Valetta trying to come to terms with the saturation of visibility in Caravaggio's painting, and eventually the painting inspired the stage image for Not I. Marion argues that the saturation of visibility in painting comes about because the visual presents itself entirely two-dimensionally, without any remainder of appresentation (In Excess). We don't worry about visualizing those sides of depicted objects that are not shown, because we have enough on our hands with what is, Marion muses with reference to Caravaggio's The Conversion of St. Paul, and has an evocative description of its effect on the viewer: I am not wondering about the largely hidden anatomy of the animal, or about the silhouette of the manservant, almost vanished, moreover in the shadow. I am not even enquiring about the identity of the light (or of the voice) that calls him: I am overwhelmed, the luminous lake flooding all at once the side opposed to the flash of lightning, which seems to have struck in front of the painting, thus behind my back (Marion 2002b: 64). Here, no doubt, the subject does not constitute any object, but the phe- nomenon overwhelms the subject with its visual saturation. If phenomena are not constituted by subjects they cannot be objectified in opposition to subjects, the iconic Protagonist points out at the end of Catastrophe. Together with the constituting subject the objectifying gaze that torments the Protago- nist also disappears: no violence can be implicit in the gaze of a receiver of phenomenal intuition who understands himself as the recipient of a gift. The iconicity of Chinese ink-splash painting and Byzantine iconography, as we see them through the filter of Beckett's Catastrophe, reveal patterns of visuality that demand of the "observer," or rather, the gifted, a way of con- ducting herself differently in the world: the framework of Ge-stell will not do, since the visual refuses to allow itself to be objectified into %uhandenheit. University of Victoria NOTES 1 . For this purpose the protagonist's stare back at the audience need not be one of defi- ance. Many other ways of performing this crucial moment are conceivable: an expression</page><page sequence="21">SANDRA WYNANDS 1 0 1 of pleading, for instance, would lend the play an entirely different tone. 2. "Noch das auBerste BewuBtsein vom Verhangnis droht zum Geschwatz zu entarten. Kulturkritik findet sich der letzten Stufe der Dialektik von Kultur und Barbarei gegeniiber: nach Auschwitz ein Gedicht zu schreiben, ist barbarisch, und das friBt auch die Erkennt- nis an, die ausspricht, warum es unmoglich ward, heute Gedichte zu schreiben" (Adorno Nonduality 30). 3. This argument has been made particularly from Buddhist points of view (cf. Loy and Coward). What makes Derrida's deconstruction incomplete for these authors is the fact that in order to avoid reification, the cycle of deconstructions has to be endless. It remains within the system of textual difference (in Derrida's usual broad understanding of this term) instead of opening onto a third space that is fully nondual and does not require the movement of the trace. 4. While it is true that the term "perception" refers to all the senses - not just the vi- sual - at the same time most sense-perception in the Western world is of a dualist kind (cf. Loy Nonduality 39). In this sense the visual, because of its cultural-historical prevalence, merely exemplifies in the most conspicuous way what is the case with all the senses. Although mo- ments of nonduality occur more readily in the aural realm, especially in listening to music, nondual listening is, as Loy points out, by no means the norm {Nonduality 70). Compare, in this respect, the following quote from contemporary Zen master Yasutani Hakuun: "Usually when I hear a bell ringing you think, consciously or unconsciously, 'I am hearing a bell.' Three things are involved: I, a bell, and hearing. But when the mind is ripe, that is, as free of discursive thought as a sheet of pure white paper is unmarred by a blemish, there is just the sound of the bell ringing." (Yasutani qtd in Loy Nonduality 71). David Levin, then, it seems to me, posits listening as an alternative mode of perception primarily because of the greater propensity of the aural to lend itself to nondual perception, not because it is by nature nondual. 5. There are other instances in Beckett's work of characters looking directly into the audience, notably in Endgame, when Clov turns his telescope on the audience and says: "I see ... a multitude ... in transports . . . of joy" (E 25). Similar to the moment in Catastrophe, here also the gaze indicates a moment in which the play steps outside its fictional horizon and self-referentially acknowledges its metaphorical character as a play on stage. In an ironically self-deprecating manner Beckett turns Clov's comment into a verdict on the entertainment value of his play: the audience, it is implied, is less than riveted by it. 6. cf. Gay McAuley: "The behavior of actors onstage is marked; spectators know that it is to be interpreted differently from apparently identical behaviors occurring in other places. Spectators in the theatre both believe and disbelieve..." (39). 7. cf. Levinas. WORKS CITED Abe, Masao. "Kenosis and Emptiness." Buddhist Emptiness and Christian Trinity. Eds.
