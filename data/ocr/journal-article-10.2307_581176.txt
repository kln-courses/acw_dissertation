<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Introduction. The following report differs in several respects from its predecessors (AR 1967-68, 29-45; 1973-74, 42-59). The appearance of Sardinia is a new departure, occasioned by a wealth of outstanding dis- coveries and publications that surely combine to remove the adjective 'isolated' from descriptions of the second largest island (pace Herodotus i 170 and vi 2: R. J. Rowland, Classical World 68 l[1974-75] 438-9) in the Mediterranean. To make room, I have omitted all mention of non-Etruscan Central Italy. I am consoled in this painful decision by my conviction that the Etruscans' Italic neighbours and contemporaries really deserve an autonomous report, similar to that on early Rome and Latium prepared by Dr Cornell (pp. 71-89 below). Meanwhile, authoritative, well-illustrated and up- to-date syntheses of the Italic regions can now by found in the seven volumes of Popoli e Civilta dell'Italia Antica (Rome: Biblioteca di Storia Patria, 1974-78; rev. JRS lxvi [1976] 206-13 and lxx [1980]). In addition, the late B. M. Felletti Maj's La tradizione italica nell'arte romana (Archaeologica iii. Rome: G. Bretschneider, 1977) is the first volume of a stimulating re-assessment of the native, Italic, contribution to Roman art; the issues at stake are considerable, and are reviewed by L. Bonfante,AJA lxxxiii (1979) 242-4. No-one is more aware than myself that the second section below, which purports to deal with the Etruscans and Etruria, affords a woefully inadequate picture of what has actually happened in the last five years. I can only plead that a much fuller picture will be found in the established sections of Studi Etruschi xlii-xlvi, compiled respectively by Professors Cristofani (Etruscan epigraphy), Prosdocimi (Italic epigraphy) and Camporeale (classified bibliography) and especially in Professor Colonna's excellent Notiziario, which has treated: Southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia (xlii; xlvi); Northern Italy (xliv); Latium, Southern Etruria, Tuscany, Umbria and the Marche (xlv). In addition, St. Etr. xlvi (1979) 595-616, with 258 numbered entries, is the first instal- ment of an international register of individual and in- stitutional projects in hand. I trust, too, that the volume Italy before the Romans (eds. D. and F. R. Ridgway; Academic Press, 1979) will not be without interest to consumers of this report: the purely Etruscan section contains specially commissioned and translated surveys of Vulci (G. Riccioni), the Etruscans in Campania (M. Frederiksen) and in Corsica (J. and L. Jehasse), the Etruscan city (G. A. Mansuelli), and Etruscan epigraphy and language (M. Cristofani). Impressive proof of the British commitment to Italy's past was provided by the decision of the British School at Rome, in collaboration with Lancaster Univer- sity, to hold a week-end conference for British scholars and students working on Italian subjects in 1977: the resulting publication ranges wide in time and in space, and ends most appropriately with reviews of the research that has been made possible by the Ellaina Macnamara Memorial Scholarship (since 1969) and The Dr M. Aylwin Cotton Foundation (since 1972): H. McK. Blake, T. W. Potter, D. B. Whitehouse, eds., Papers in Italian Archaeology I = British Archaeological Reports Supplementary Series xli (1978). The period under review culminated (December 1979) in a colloquium on the Etruscans and Rome, held to honour an unprecedented coincidence of round figures: the 70th year of Professor Massimo Pallottino's age, his 40th year as a University teacher and the pub- lication of a selection of the papers he has published in the last 50 years: Saggi di Antichita, Rome: G. Bret- schneider, 1979 (rev. JRS lxx [1980]). SARDINIA General. In the English-speaking world, Margaret Guido's Sardinia (Thames and Hudson, 1963) has for long been the standard introduction to all periods of Sardinian archaeology. Seventeen years on, it still serves honour- ably as a convenient yard-stick against which subsequent progress can be assessed and as a practical introduction to the study of the more detailed text-book by Giovanni Lilliu, doyen of Sardinian archaeology and culture (La civilta dei Sardi dal neolitico all'eta dei nuraghi, 3rd ed.; Turin: ERI, 1975). Other recent general works in- clude an excellent survey of Nuragic affairs by Ercole Contu in Popoli e Civilta dell7talia Antica iii (1974) 145-203 with pls. 105-64; in the same volume, V. Tusa's account of Punic civilization in Italy as a whole contains many useful examples of the reciprocal illumi- nation that can be expected from comparison of Sicilian and Sardinian experiences (ibid. 11-142, especially 69-85). These two items were published in the same year as C. R. Whittaker's thoughtful study of the west- ern Phoenicians as colonizers, Proc. Cam. Philol. Soc. xx (1974) 58-79, to which may be added the same author's study of Carthaginian imperialism in the 5th and 4th centuries (in Garnsey and Whittaker, eds., Imperialism in the Ancient World, Cambridge 1978, 59-90): there is much of relevance to Phoenicio-Punic Sardinia in both. The Sardinian chapter in Sabatino Moscati's I Cartaginesi in Italia (Milan: Mondadori, 1977) has superseded the equivalent information in his World of the Phoenicians (London 1968, 1973). The first three instalments in the 10-volume Storia della Sardegna antica e modema (ed. A. Boscolo; pub. Chiarella, Sassari) are basic: E. Atzeni, Sardegna preistorica e nuragica - though this item is not yet available, for reasons that will become obvious below; F. Barreca, Sardegna fenicia e punica (1974); P. Meloni, Sardegna romana (1975). Intending visitors may care to know that the first volume in a new series of guides, Itinerari archeologici, edited by Moscati, is E. Acquaro's Sardegna (Rome: Newton Compton, 1979), and that D. and F. R. Ridg- way's Sardinia: an archaeological guide (Faber) should be in the press by the time these pages appear in print. A major exhibition of Sardinian art and archaeology is scheduled to take place in the Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe, in 1980; the catalogue and handbook are said to contain several important new statements (Kunst und Kultur Sardiniens vom Neolithikum bis zum Ende der Nuraghenzeit, ed. J. Thimme; an English-language ver- sion is being prepared by Professor Miriam S. Balmuth of Tufts University). The progress that has been made in all periods since 1963 (Guido) - and indeed since 1975 (Lilliu) - is of far more than local significance, and calls in particular for a wholesale re-appraisal of Sardinia's role in pan-</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Mediterranean intercourse long before the establishment of the first Phoenician colonies. Most revolutionary of all is the discovery that there are more pre-Nuragic periods to re-appraise: the prehistoric time-scale has been extended by a matter of millennia - and well- populated millennia, at that. Although no detailed re-thinking can be attempted here, I hope that some indication of certain major advances will emerge in what follows: to that end, news is presented below in chrono- logical rather than territorial order. I should like to acknowledge at once that my largest single debt in this section is to a number of recent admirable initiatives of the Soprintendenza ai Beni Archeologici per le province di Sassari e Nuoro (Dr Francesco Nicosia, Superintend- ent; Dr Fulvia Lo Schiavo, Inspector until 1979) in the way of temporary exhibitions illustrated by excellent catalogues. The latter are published locally, under the aus- pices of the Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali, and are on sale (o si sic omnes) at good bookshops throughout the island; I use the following abbreviations when citing them:- Catalogo 1976 = Nuove testimonianze archeologiche della Sardegna centro-settentrionale (Sassari: Dessi) Catalogo 1978 = Sardegna centro-orientale dal neo- litico alla fine del mondo antico: Nuoro, Museo civico speleo-archeologico (Sassari: Dessi) Contributi 1979 =Contributi su Giovanni Spano, 1803-1878 (Sassari: Chiarella) Under the same auspices, a valuable series of Quademi has been edited by Dr Nicosia since 1976. The following (hereafter Sassari Quaderni) have appeared to date: 1. E. Contu, Un museo per tutti (on the new museum in Sassari); 2. F. Lo Schiavo, II ripostiglio del nuraghe Flumenelongu (Alghero, Sassari); 3. P. B. Serra, Reperti tardoantichi e altomedievali dalla Nurra; 4. F. Guido, Le monete puniche della collezione L.

The nature of the permanent collection in Sassari (Museo Nazionale G. A. Sanna) was naturally affected by the creation of a separate archaeological Superintendency in 1958. Overnight, a somewhat unwieldy assemblage derived mainly from private sources (re-arranged between 1879 and 1882 by the distinguished ancient historian Ettore Pais) was con- verted into the legally constituted repository for ma- terial excavated or confiscated in the modern adminis- trative provinces of Sassari (hereafter SS) and Nuoro (NU). Work on the inevitable re-organization began in the late 'sixties under the direction of the then Super- intendent, Dr (now Professor) Contu. His aim through- out is summarized in a quotation from the writings of the philosopher Karl Popper, reproduced on the first of many explanatory panels: 'We should take pride in always speaking in the simplest, clearest and least pretentious way possible; and we should avoid, like the plague, giving the impression that we possess knowledge that is too profound to be expressed simply and clearly'. The result of Professor Contu's single-minded adherence to this principle is one of the most stimulating and informative local museums in Europe. Opened in 1973, it currently affords the best available introduction to Sardinian archaeology. There is a guide to the museum in the Itinerari series published by the Italian Libreria dello Stato (E. Contu and M. L. Frongia, II nuovo Museo Nazionale 'Giovanni Antonio Sanna' di Sassari, 1976); and those with a professional interest in museum affairs will also be interested in an illustrated technical account of the criteria and methods of display (Sassari Quaderni 1). Elsewhere in the territory of the Sassari Superintend- ency, a Museo Civico Speleo-Archeologico has recently been established in Nuoro. As its name implies, this excellent small museum owes its existence to the en- thusiasm of a local speleological group (the 'Gruppo Grotte Nuorese') and to the high professional standard of its members' association with primary research in the fields of mineralogy, petrology, entomology and palae- ontology. The group's archaeological work is co-ordinated by M. Sanges in exemplary - on both sides - collabor- ation with the Superintendency, and its importance was recognized in the exhibition of mainly new discoveries mounted in 1978 on the occasion of the XXII Riunione Scientifica of the Istituto Italiano di Preistoria e Proto- storia. This meeting was devoted to new trends in the pre- and proto-history of central and northern Sardinia (Atti forthcoming; the Riassunti and Guida alle es- cursioni are useful meanwhile). The exhibition (of which Catalogo 1978 is a detailed account) provided the lion's share - there have been important subsequent ad- ditions - of the permanent collection that is now open to the public. Its contents, in four modestly furnished rooms, are especially informative on the role of Sardinia's east coast in the exchange mechanisms that were prolifer- ating at a crucial stage in the later prehistory of the Mediterranean. Relations with Etruria are of particular relevance to this area; they have been treated in com- munications, now in the press, by M. Gras to the 1978 Riunione mentioned above and by Dr Lo Schiavo to the 1979 Convegno di Studi Etruschi ed Italici; previous bibliography on the subject is conveniently assembled by G. Bartoloni and F. Delpino, St. Etr. xliii (1975) 41 ff. No account, however brief, of Sardinian archaeology would be complete without a reference to the quite extraordinary extent, rivalled only in Denmark, to which the remote past mingles with the contemporary Sardinian scene. In part at least, this is surely the result of one of the most remarkable intellectual careers of 19th century Europe: that of Canon Giovanni Spano (1803-1878), grammarian and lexicographer of the Sardinian language and its dialects, authority on Sardinian painting and architecture, Professor (of Holy Writ and Oriental Languages) and later Rector of Cagliari University, Director of Cagliari Museum and the undisputed 'father of Sardinian archaeology'. In 1978, the centenary of his death was commemorated by an exhibition in the Sassari Museum and by a series of lectures, both de- signed to illustrate the stunning range of his interests and achievements (Contributi 1979, whence the following notes). In the field of archaeology, Spano's name is associated with virtually every discovery of note made 55</page><page sequence="3">56 D. RIDGWAY in Sardinia between c. 1850 and his death. The museums in Cagliari and Sassari owe much to his ingenuity in securing such finds for public exhibition: they range from the Esterzili Decree (K. Wellesley, The Long Year A.D. 69 [London 1975] 48-9) to the Serra Ilixi ox-hide ingots - obtained by Spano for Cagliari in 1857, thir- teen years before Schliemann began his excavations at Troy, and forty-six years before the discovery of any comparable pieces (at Haghia Triadha in 1903). No less significantly, Spano conducted the first excavations in Sardinia that paid any attention to stratigraphy (in 1874); he was the first writer on Sardinian archaeology to use the Stone-Bronze-Iron 'Three Age System' pion- eered by Northern scholars - an innovation seen in some quarters at the time as heretical, or even 'liberal' (im- plying revolution of a non-intellectual kind); in 1855 he founded (and for many years largely wrote) the monthly Bullettino Archeologico Sardo, which may reasonably be seen as combining the functions of similar journals founded on the Italian mainland in 1875 (Bullettino di Paletnologia Italiana) and 1876 (Notizie degli Scavi). In 1859, Spano donated his personal collection of several thousand artefacts to the Cagliari Museum, thereby ensuring Cagliari's status as the seat not only of the oldest (1806) but also of the most extensive col- lection of Sardinian material. In time, this position was enhanced by the fact that until 1958 the Cagliari archae- ological Superintendency was responsible for the whole island. Since the creation of a second Superintendency in Sassari, however, the museum's catchment area has been limited to the province of Cagliari itself (hereafter CA), part of which now forms the new province of Oristano (OR). At the time of writing, archaeological affairs in Cagliari are. passing through a most promis- ing transition period. It is recognized that the present quarters of the Museo Nazionale Archeologico are inadequate: given the pace of discovery and excavation in the south as in the north it could hardly be otherwise. The magazines are full to overflowing; and in the public area (four large rooms and three small ones) the em- phasis is by force of circumstances on full cases. Plans currently under discussion are said to include a proposal for converting the present museum building into a reserve collection, and to house suitable public galleries with the Istituto di Studi Sardi and the University De- partments of Archaeology and Art History under one roof elsewhere. Further developments are eagerly awaited. On a much smaller scale, a similar situation has long existed in the Antiquarium Arborense at Oristano (on its collection of Etruscan bucchero and other 6th century imported pottery from Tharros, see M. Gras, MEFRA lxxxvi [1974] 79-139): and it is good to hear that Oristano's recently acquired status as a provincial capital has stimulated plans for a new archaeological museum there. The pre-Nuragic sequence. It is no longer true that the story of human occupation in Sardinia begins to all intents and purposes with the Copper Age San Michele (Ozieri) culture, nor yet that 'the few sites which may prove to be earlier... cannot be placed for certain in their chronological order' (Guido 1963, 36): the earlier sites are now many, their chronological priority is not in doubt, and some sort of order is emerging. A decade of unpublished excavation by Professor W!4 1Y - Fig. 1 Enrico Atzeni of the University of Cagliari has brought to light substantial quantities of Neolithic material from various sites in the Sulcis-Iglesiente area centred on Carbonia (CA). The rock-shelter of Su Carroppu (Sirri) has yielded small obsidian tools and cardium-impressed sherds (E. Atzeni, Nuovi idoli della Sardegna prenuragica, 1975 [reprinted from Studi Sardi] 33 fig. 5 - whence the selection in Fig. 1): the same combination is dated to the 6th millennium (b.c.: 'radiocarbon years') at Basi and Curacchiaghiu in Corsica (P. Phillips, Early Farmers of West Mediterranean Europe [London 1975] 47 f.). There is more evidence (obsidian and impressed ware) of Neolithic settlement in the northern half of Sardinia, too, from recently excavated caves and rock-shelters such as the Grotta Rifugio (Oliena, NU) and the Grotta dell'Inferno (Muros, SS). Neolithic material of a differ- ent type, stratified below San Michele (Ozieri) levels in a number of trenches, has been excavated at Sa 'ucca de su Tintirriolu, Bonu Ighinu (Mara, SS), by Father Renato Loria and Dr David Trump (Mon. Ant. ser. misc. ii, 2 [1978] - whence the selection in Fig. 2): it is defined by them as a new Bonu Ighinu culture, with a single radiocarbon date of 3730± 160 b.c. (which means roughly 4500 B.C. in calendar years). A Bonu Ighinu presence was also detected in the 1978 excavations at the Grotta Rifugio (above; P. Biagi and M. Cremaschi in Catalogo 1978, 11-15) and in the Grotta di Monte Maiore (Thiesi, SS), where certain broad and indirect similarities with Neolithic pottery characteristic of Apulia and Sicily have been mentioned (F. Lo Schiavo, Catalogo 1976, 15-25). Some kind of contact with a very different part of the Italian mainland is indicated by fragments of a 'Square Mouthed Vase' found in a clandestine excavation at Sa 'ucca in 1975: this form is characteristic of Liguria, where neutron activation ana- lysis (B. R. Hallam et al., Proc. Prehist. Soc. xlii [1976] 85-110) has demonstrated the presence of Sardinian obsidian between the mid4th and mid-3rd millennia. The evidence from the above and from other recently excavated sites points clearly to a sizeable pre-San Michele (Ozieri) population, present in a number of different areas. The stratigraphical indications at some of the sites (Sa 'ucca is a case in point) for a chronological succession that includes San Michele inevitably raises the question of cultural continuity. The obviously local nature of any such process throws doubt on the tra- ditional status of San Michele as an intrusive culture, whether of ultimately East Mediterranean origin (W. D 4D A </page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Fig. 3 Bray, Riv. Scienze Preist. xviii [1963]) or not. On the other hand, the fact that Sardinia clearly attracted and maintained the interest of the outside world from the cardium-impressed stage of the Neolithic accords ill with a more recent allusion to 'a flourishing but inward- looking local tradition of the sort that characterized the entire prehistoric development of the island' (R. Whitehouse, Antiquity xlvi [1972] 278). It is well enough known that copper metallurgy was apparently not of primary importance to the San Michele (Ozieri) groups; indeed, Dr Bray suggested at one point that the artefacts concerned could be seen as a homo- geneous group which finds its closest parallels in French and Spanish Beaker contexts. In this latter connection, it may be noted that Professor Atzeni's excavations in the mineral-rich south-west are as relevant to international Beaker studies as they are to Neolithic explanations. Meanwhile, the two radiocarbon dates from the exten- sive San Michele levels at Sa 'ucca and the pair from similar contexts in the Grotta del Guano (Oliena, NU: E. Castaldi, Arch. Antrop. Etn. cii [1972] 233-75) are consistently in the range 3190-2850 b.c. - which suggests that the culture was flourishing long before the end of the 4th millennium B.C. Accordingly, Loria and Trump (Mon. Ant., cit., 211) conclude that the San Michele (Ozieri) culture is fully Neolithic for the greater part of its duration. And in 1978 Professor Contu presented the following sequence of approximate dates (reproduced in the Riassunti of the XXII Riunione, cit.): Early Neolithic 5500-4000 B.C., with (cardium-) impressed ware; Middle Neolithic 4000-3100 B.C., with Bonu Ighinu; Late Neolithic 3100-2000 B.C., with San Michele (Ozieri); Copper Age 2000-1700 B.C., with Monte Claro (and Beakers from 1750); Bronze Age from 1700, with Bunnanaro 'shading into' Nuragic not later than 1500. Previously, the Neolithic was divided simply into 'Antico' (the Grotta Rifugio phase) and 'Recente' (Bonu Ighinu); this is the scheme followed in the Sassari Museum dis- play (Contu and Frongia, cit., chronological table; and many recent publications); the Nuoro Museum and Catalogo 1978 follow the new scheme. There seems to be no serious objection to the tentative assignation of a Copper Age identity to Monte Claro - an essentially cer- amic phenomenon. Monte Claro, Beaker and Bunnanaro wares are all represented in the post-San Michele period of the unique 'temple' of Monte d'Accoddi (SS); and a Bunnanaro burial in the adjacent domus de janas cem- etery (G. Tanda, Catalogo 1976, 35-50) has recently yielded evidence for cross-dating with Bronze Age cultures elsewhere - the assemblage contained a vase of hour-glass shape (Fig. 3), unique in Sardinia, which finds its closest parallel in the Early Bronze Age Castelluccio culture of Sicily. Another San Michele - Monte Claro - Beaker - Bunnanaro sequence is promised from the im- portant unpublished domus de janas cemetery recently excavated at Montessu (Santadi, CA). Two observations may be made at this point. Firstly, there is an urgent need for many more radiocarbon determinations from informatively stratified prehistoric sequences in Sardinia: less than a dozen are listed in J. M. Coles and A. F. Harding, The Bronze Age in Europe (London 1979) 201, 451. Secondly, readers must be prepared for a situation in which the 'Copper Age' is increasingly being seen in 'Late Neolithic' terms - and for the terminological discrepancies that inevitably ensue. It will be interesting to see if, in the fullness of time, any 'second radiocarbon revolutionary' will mount the kind of attack on the Sardinian Copper Age that has recently been directed towards that of U~~~i- I Fig. 2 57 u</page><page sequence="5">58 D. RIDGWAY Fig. 4 the peninsula: R. Whitehouse and A. C. Renfrew, BSA Ixix [1974] 343-90, reprinted in Renfrew, Problems in European Prehistory (Edinburgh 1979) 201-54. Finally, it remains to note that the style of Bunnanaro pottery is eminently plain; Bunnanaro is instantly distinguishable from Monte Claro, but not always from the simpler Nuragic pottery. A current view, which has much to commend it, is that the Nuragic period in fact begins with Bunnanaro - and not, as used to be postu- lated, with Monte Claro (Contu in Popoli e Civilta iii, cit., 175). Whatever its technological identity, it is now more likely than ever before that San Michele (Ozieri) provides the cultural context for the first stages in the remarkable Sardinian series of representations of the human form. Incised human figures on the pottery are matched by the anthropomorphic single standing stones studied by Professor Atzeni (Nuovi idoli, cit.), who assigns them to the San Michele-Early Bronze Age range. The statue menhirs of Genna Arrele (Laconi, NU) incorporate schematic representations of warriors with daggers in their belts; their appearance in the new museum at Nuoro was directly responsible for the discovery and excavation in 1979 of a unique chamber tomb near Nurallao that is actually built of (sic) statue menhirs. In another study (La Dea Madre nelle culture pre- nuragiche, 1978 [reprinted from Studi Sardi], whence Fig. 4), Professor Atzeni has examined an important class of stone idols to which a number of additions have recently been made; they adhere magnificently to a formula well known throughout the Mediterranean in the 3rd millennium B.C. Evidence for the practice of a very different art is revealed in the definitive publication of a Bunnanaro burial in the Grotta di Sisaia (Oliena, NU). The skeleton was that of a young girl whose skull had been trepanned, but qualified medical opinion confirms that this delicate operation was not the cause of death. On the contrary: the bone disc was restored, and was 'accepted' by the surrounding bone tissue (F. Germana in Sassari Quaderni 6) - a feature that renders Sisaia's case history unique in the annals of palaeopathology. There are a few more cases of trepan- ning in Sardinia, most of them in Bunnanaro contexts; it is hard not to recall that the technique was known to the European Beaker folk (whose skill in the practice is attested as far away as Dorset). As was only to be expected, the birth of the Nuoro Museum has led to the appearance and subsequent display of many previously unknown private collections of antiquities found in the province. One, from Ottana, consists of a hoard of bronze weapons of especial interest: in her preliminary publication of the group (Catalogo 1978, 75-9), Dr Lo Schiavo has pointed to affinities with Cypriote hook-tang weapons on the one hand and with British Wessex 'Arreton Down' daggers on the other - a range of far-flung contact, direct or indirect, that suggests a Sardinian role in pan-Mediterranean cross-currents at a somewhat earlier stage in the Bronze Age than had hitherto been supposed. Nuragic and Phoenician. International metallurgy strikes an appropriate note on which to open a review of recent progress in Nuragic and Phoenician exegesis. The interpretation of the non-urban cultural entity associated with Sardinia's most characteristic field- monument is fraught with well-known difficulties. Even if we had more calibrated radiocarbon dates from Nuragic sites that took the nuraghi into, or even beyond, the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C., it would still be true that datable artefacts do not take us much further back than the 9th century. Worse still, on the origins of the people themselves, it still has to be admitted that 'it is difficult to say how this people was formed, because neither the way nor the precise time of their final assumption of a distinctive identity is clear' (Contu in Popoli e Civilta iii, cit., 146). In addition, the most problematical feature of Sardinian archaeology - re- use of settlement sites and of collective multi-period tombs - is joined in the Nuragic period by what Gordon Childe once called the 'extraordinarily conservative' tendencies of the island's metalworkers, at least as seen in their hoards. The best-known assemblages of Nuragic metalwork are briefly described (as currency, founder's or votive hoards: 9th-6th centuries) by Mrs Guido (1963, 164 ff.). Of the fifty or so mainly unpublished hoards that could be added to her list, Dr Lo Schiavo has recently drawn attention to an interesting example found (1967) in the territory of the Nuraghe Flumenelongu in the Nurra, about 20km. north-east of Alghero (SS). It consists of: a flat axe with lateral ears (probably a local type, influ- enced by contemporary developments in Spain and Portugal); a broken and miscast lugged axe, of a type attested in the Near East, mainland Italy, Sicily, Spain and the British Isles; a shaft-hole axe which may be com- pared with types characteristic of Final Bronze Age contexts on the Italian mainland; a pair of pennanular bracelets; a hilt fragment; and 32 bun-ingots (Sassari Quademi ii). Dr Lo Schiavo dates this hoard to the end of the 10th - beginning of the 9th centuries, and sees it as a far from unique indication of the 'contacts that must have linked the coasts of Sardinia with the "tin route", which left the Aegean, touched Cyprus, passed through Sicily, and then via the Tyrrhenian coasts of ' - l I ) i1 </page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Lazio and Tuscany, and Sardinia, reached Spain, the Atlantic coast of Portugal, and finally England and Ireland in one direction and Brittany in another'. By the time of the Flumenelongu hoard, whatever happened in earlier periods, there can be no doubt that Sardinia had been in touch with the East Mediterranean world for some time. As we have seen, copper ox-hide ingots have been known in the island since Spano's day: published and unpublished examples now amount to a total of more than twenty from nearly a dozen widely distributed Sardinian find-spots (Lilliu inEstudios dedicados a Luis Pericot [Barcelona 1973] 298 f.); and a fragmentary ingot from the Nuraghe Nastasi (Tertenia, NU) is said to have been found at the same depth as a tantalizingly undiagnostic painted sherd of potter's clay (P. Basoli in Riassunti, cit., 15). A round date of 1200 B.C. for the ingot-type was provided by the discovery in 1960 of several specimens in the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck off the coast of Southern Turkey (G. Bass, Cape Gelidonya: a Bronze Age shipwreck = Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc. 57: viii [1967]); the excavator has suggested that this Phoenician merchantman could have been trading with Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, Troy, the Hittite Empire, Crete and the Greek mainland. What was Sardinia's role in this pre-eminently inter- national traffic? Most probably, the island was seen by the outside world primarily as a source of raw material rather than as a likely outlet for finished products- an explanation similar to that prompted by the distribution of obsidian from Sardinia in Neolithic times. N. K. Sandars (The Sea Peoples [London 1978] 101) has suggested that East Mediterranean merchants might have insisted on handling Sardinian metal in the ox-hide shape to which they were accustomed; and her hypoth- esis is surely supported by practical considerations connected with the business of stowing a heavy cargo for a long sea voyage. If this explanation is feasible, the presence in Sardinia of ingots of East Mediterranean appearance becomes less surprising; they were not imports, but exports, or consignments of export quality destined for home consumption -diagnoses that recall Sardinia's status as a source of native copper since Beaker times. R. F. Tylecote (J. Field Archaeology iii [1976] 196-201) has described the spectrographic analysis of four ox-hide ingots in the Cagliari Museum, three of them from Serra Ilixi (Spano's group); on the results of this investigation, compared with those ob- tained in the East Mediterranean (T. S. Wheeler et al., Expedition xvii 4 [1975] 30-39), he is inclined to suggest that his Sardinian quartet 'could be from the same ore deposit' and that 'they probably did not come from Cyprus'. It remains true that 'until we obtain some analysis of ores and fluxes from Sardinia, we cannot say whether or not these ingots could have come from Sardinia itself. Further indications of the East Mediterranean prov- enance of stimuli appropriate to the development of Sardinian metallurgy are not lacking. A Syro-Palestinian bronze figurine, roughly contemporary with the ox-hide ingots, comes from the area of the Flumenelongu nuraghe and hoard; there is another from the vicinity of the newly-restored Nuragic well at Santa Cristina (Paulilatino, OR) in the interior; a third from Sciacca (Agrigento) in Sicily; and a fourth from Spain (L. Vagnetti, Proc. Prehist. Soc. xlix [1973] 467 f.) - all, in other words, from areas which were notoriously colonized in later times by the Phoenicians, who may (or may not) also have been responsible for the sizeable quantity of Nuragic pottery found on the Aeolian island of Lipari in contexts ranging from the 12th to the early 9th centuries (Contu in Meligunis Lipdra iv). Traditionally, the first Phoenician colony in Sardinia was founded at Nora (CA), a coastal site with a combin- ation of practical advantages that demonstrates the ac- curacy of Thucydides' (vi 2) description of Phoenician predilections in the matter of topography. Recent work on the interpretation of the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, extant since 1773, does not seem to have received the attention it deserves: B. Peckham, Orientalia xli (1972) 457-68; F. M. Cross, BASOR ccviii (1972) 13-19. Cross' translation requires the ad- dition of two lines at the beginning (the top of the stone has been cut off) and reads as follows:- [He fought (?)] [with the Sardinians (?)] at Tarsis / and he drove them out. / Among the Sardinians / he is [now] at peace, / (and) his army is at peace: / Milkat6n son of / Subna (Shebna), general / of (king) Pummay'. It is suggested (and cf. W. F. Albright, BASOR lxxxiii [1941] 14-22) that 'Tarsis' might mean 'mine/smelting plant/refinery town' rather than Tarsus in Cilicia or Tartessus in Spain. 'Pummay' might well be seen as the name of the king to whom the general Milkaton owed his allegiance: the Pygmalion of Greek tradition, the king of Tyre whose long reign (820-774 or 831-785) was the high point of Phoenician glory. It is thus at least conceivable that the Nora Stone commemorates a victory over Nuragic forces won by Phoenicians sent (at the end of the 9th or beginning of the 8th century) to acquire or to protect important mining and industrial interests. Given the location of Nora, these are most likely to have been in the south-west highlands of Sardinia, which are rich in argentiferous lead and iron-ore: precisely the area that was guarded, in the different circumstances of the later 7th century onwards, by the massive Punic hill-forts of L" , U ;h Fig. 5 59</page><page sequence="7">60 D. RIDGWAY 0 od(rz o 0 Fig. 6 Monte Sirai and Pani Loriga (C. R. Whittaker, Proc. Cam. Philol. Soc. xx [1974] 63 f. and bibliography there cited). As in the case of the Nuragic pottery on Lipari, the 'Phoenician carrier' hypothesis has been proposed in connection with the unmistakably Sardinian beaked jugs from late 9th century contexts at Vetulonia, Populonia, Cerveteri, Vulci and Tarquinia in Etruria (G. Colonna in Supplemento Annali xxii, Ist. It. Numismatica [1975] 4 f.). Interestingly enough, good parallels for them have been found at the newly-excavated Nuragic foundry of Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros (Oliena, NU), not far inland from the Gulf of Orosei on the east coast of Sardinia (F. Lo Schiavo, Catalogo 1976, 69-78, whence Fig. 6; Catalogo 1978, 99-101, whence Fig. 5). Other foundries cur- rently being investigated include one in the Nuragic complex of Ortu Comidu (Sardara, CA; Guido 1963, 153-5; M. S. Balmuth, J. Field Archaeology iii [1976] 195 f.), where excavation by Tufts University is linked with various projects of laboratory analysis of Sardinian metalwork. Not far away, on the highest hill in the Marmilla range, Genna Maria (Villanovaforru, CA), Professor Atzeni is currently directing the excavation of a Nuragic complex similar in scale and significance to that of the Nuraghe Su Nuraxi at Barumini (CA). It is already apparent that Genna Maria is a multi-period site, where an original central tower was reinforced first with an inner and then with a polygonal outer wall; in the course of subsequent dismantling and rebuilding from the 8th century onwards, a metal foundry and associated workshops were installed; they have/left abundant traces of use in the form of stone and pottery crucibles, carbonized wood and tuyeres (bellows mouth- pieces). Further developments at, and publication of, these two sites are eagerly awaited. The situation they suggest is in keeping with Dr Tylecote's remarks after an examination of Nuragic material in museums: 'it is clear that metal was being cast in almost all the nuraghi as a normal occupation. It is possible that the smiths were itinerant but that the wealthier nuraghi could employ a full-time smith' (in Balmuth, cit., 196). The material from Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros (Fig. 6) in- cludes a bronze handle-attachment, parallelled not only on one of the cauldrons in the nearby Grotta Su Benti- cheddu (F. Lo Schiavo, Catalogo 1978, 89-91, whence Fig. 7) but also at Enkomi in Cyprus (post 1200 B.C.). There are other bronzes too, for which comparanda have been sought in the peninsular Recent/Final Bronze Age L i F-i(s Fie. 7 o / Fig. 8 7 0 0 - -0.</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 hoards of Piediluco and Contigliano in Umbria. Further comparanda for the Sa Sedda material will be found in the remarkable Nuragic votive deposit discovered in 1968 in the Grotta di Pirosu, Su Benatzu (south of Santadi, CA: Lilliu in Estudios Pericot, cit., 283-313). The material prosperity of the area and the scale of Phoenician activities there are both illustrated by the Su Benatzu material: three gold ornaments (elsewhere in Sardinia, gold is conspicuous by its absence); 106 items of copper and bronze (weapons, rings, bun-ingots and several fibulas - among them an Iberian type attested at Pithekoussai: F. Lo Schiavo, St. Etr. xlvi [1978] 40, fig. 7); nearly 1500 ceramic finds; and a miniature bronze tripod of Cypriot type (Fig. 8), datable to the end of the 9th or to the beginning of the 8th century. Was the latter piece made by a Cypriot craftsman, or by a Sardinian pupil? Analogous questions might reasonably be asked about the much earlier Ottana hoard of foreign dagger types (above), and about the better known 'Euboeanizing' painted urn from the Sulcis tophet (J. N. Coldstream, Greek Geometric Pottery [London 1968] 388; C. Tronchetti, Riv. Studi Fenici forthcoming). For the moment, the fact that such questions can be asked at all must suffice to focus attention on a factor of Mediterranean significance that has been seriously underestimated in the past. Much has been made hither- to, not least by the present writer, of 'pre-colonial' Greek prospectors in the metalliferous areas of Etruria. But Sardinia is also rich in metals: and recent and cur- rent projects combine to present us, more clearly than ever before, with the probability that their exploitation by native smiths was stimulated, taught or even com- missioned by the entrepreneurs from the Levant who were known to the Greeks as Phoenicians (A. Mele, II commercio greco arcaico = Cahiers Berard iv [1979] 87-91). Was there, indeed, a consciously observed territorial division in the West, between Phoenician activities in Sardinia and Euboean activities along the Tyrrhenian coast (Campania, Latium and Southern Etruria)? It seems unlikely, although it must be admitted at once that we still know very little about the precise relation- ship of these two great commercial forces with each other, with their suppliers and with their markets. For one thing, there is some reason to suppose that there was a 'Phoenician component' in the early (c. 750- 725) population of the first Western Greek establish- ment, at Pithekoussai on the Bay of Naples (D. Ridgway, Magna Grecia xiii:11-12 [1978] 14-18). Less contro- versial, perhaps, are two other factors. Firstly, on present evidence - especially that from Sardinia - it is clear that the Phoenicians preceded the first Western Greeks in western waters; they may even have shown them the way. Secondly, as has already been mentioned, there is evidence of contact of some kind between Sardinia and Etruria from the 9th century onwards; and it is not obviously sporadic. One aspect of the relationship between Sardinia and Etruria has been examined by Dr Lo Schiavo in an interesting review of the 49 bronze fibulas of 9th-8th century date that have been found in Sardinia (St. Etr. xlvi cit.). She concludes that at least 20 of them were imported from the Central Italian mainland, and that a number of the others were manufactured locally in imitation of the imported examples. Dr Lo Schiavo suggests convincingly that the limited Sardinian distri- bution of these personal ornaments (which are found literally in their thousands on the mainland) is to be explained in terms of fashion: the evidence of the contemporary Nuragic bronzes suggests that garments were made of heavy material, similar to serge, which a fibula would not be strong enough to fasten. If accept- able, this explanation suggests that relations between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula were intimate and frequent enough to permit the personal importation of what might be called souvenirs. In the above narrative, I have concentrated on recent discoveries and publications that have advanced current thinking on Sardinia's position in the Mediterranean world as a whole. I hope that this policy has not given the impression that purely Nuragic affairs are either static or parochial. They are not: and indeed, during the period under review, the Nuragic scene has been enlivened by one of the most remarkable discoveries made anywhere on Italian soil in the present century. The usual definition of the Nuragic bronzes as 'bron- zetti' underlines the absence of any sculpture on a larger scale. This gap was unexpectedly filled by the chance discovery in 1974 of a group of extraordinary life-size stone statues. The figures represented in the group - which is quite without precedent -include warriors and archers: they are tentatively dated on stylistic grounds to the 8th century. Excavation of the site (Fig. 9) concerned, Monte Prama (Cabras, OR), is still in progress; it is directed in the field by Dr Carlo Tronchetti of the Cagliari Superintendency. Given the physical characteristics of the stone used, it would appear that the statues were intended to be seen in- doors: their context may well have been a religious sanctuary (associated with a hero-cult?), of a new or at least hitherto undocumented type - and so perhaps of more than local importance.

Lilliu, Dal 'betilo' aniconico alla statuaria nuragica, 1977 (reprinted from Studi Sardi), 41 ff. ETRURIA The Etruscans. Of the making of books about the Etruscans there is no end: happily, a number of those now available demonstrate that bad currency cannot drive out good. M. Pallottino's fundamental text-book The Etruscans, revised and based on the sixth Italian edition of his Etruscologia (Milan: Hoepli, 1968; 1973), was published by Allen Lane in 1975 and as a Pelican in 1978. M. Cristofani's The Etruscans: a new investi- gation (London: Orbis, 1979) is a brilliantly illustrated general account that draws authoritatively on the latest findings in a variety of fields - not least those that Cristofani has made his own; and so does the same author's L 'Arte degli Etruschi: produzione e consumo (Turin: Einaudi, 1978). The late Otto J. Brendel's Etruscan Art, completed by Emeline Richardson for the Pelican History of Art (1978), is another stimulating treatment of the period between Villanovan and Hel- lenistic that ranges more widely (and more deeply) than its title would suggest; and the annotated plates of M. Sprenger and G. Bartoloni, Die Etrusker: Kunst und Geschichte (Munich: Hirmer, 1977) have now effectively replaced G. Q. Giglioli, L'Arte etrusca (1933) as the standard illustrated corpus. Commonplaces about the Etruscans abound. Hope that they are not necessarily ineradicable is provided by recent sober examinations of three of the most vulner- able topics: women (L. Bonfante, Arethusa vi [1973] 91-101), historiography (T. J. Cornell, Ann. Sc. Norm. Sup. Pisa3 vi [1976] 411-39) and piracy (M. Gras in L 'Italie preromaine ... Melanges Heurgon = Coll. Ecole Fr. Rome xxvii [1.976] 341-69). Historical areas in which new ground has been broken include that treated by M. Torelli in Elogia Tarquiniensia (Florence: Sansoni, 1975; rev. T. J. Cornell, JRS lxviii [1978] 167-73; J. Heurgon, St. Etr. xlvi [1978] 617-23); Etruscan- Punic relations (J. Macintosh Turfa, AJA lxxxi [1977] 368-74); Romanization (P. Bruun et al., Studies in the Romanization of Etruria = Acta Inst. Rom. Finlandiae v [1975]; rev. R. G. Lewis, CR xci [1977] 221-3; and, on economic conditions in Northern Etruria, W. V. Harris in Prospettiva, Supplemento i [1977] 56-63). M. Cristofani has applied anthropological theories of gift exchange to the circulation of luxury goods in Etruria (Par. Pass. xxx [1975] 132-52); a comparison of his findings with those of a recent treatment of similar phenomena in the Celtic world (F. Fischer, Germania li [1973] 436-59) confirms that the historian of Etruria would do well to acquaint himself with the methods of the prehistorian. In this respect, economic considerations are of paramount importance: they are outlined in a pioneering study by G. Colonna in Sup- plemento Annali xxii, Ist. It. Numismatica (1975) 3-23. Among the overall treatments of individual aspects of Etruscan material culture, pride of place must be accorded to those concerned with the two features which, together with language, served to establish national identity in the ancient world (Virgil, Aen. viii 722-3): L. Bonfante, Etruscan Dress (London and Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1975); and P. F. Stary on arms and armour, Proc. Prehist. Soc. xlv (1979) 179- 206. The latter author has also studied fire-dogs and similar aristocratic apparatus in Italy in Kleine Schriften aus dem Vorgeschichtlichen Seminar Marburg v (1979) 40-61 - a fascicule which also contains (62-99) a valuable study of Villanovan and early Etruscan material in Greece and the Aegean by F.-W. von Hase, whose study of early gold in Central Italy contains much of Etruscan interest (Hamburger Beitrdge zur Archaologie v 2 [1975] 99-182), as do G. Holbl's definitive account of aegyptiaca in Italy (Beziehungen der dgyptischen Kultur zu Altitalien, Leiden: Brill, 1978) and F. Can- ciani's paper on Phoenician bowls (Arch. Anz. 1979, 1-6; cf.AR 1973-74,54). Etruscan pottery studies are dominated by Tom B. Rasmussen's Bucchero pottery from Southern Etruria (Cambridge 1979), which in addition to its many other virtues possesses the considerable one of publishing and illustrating many vital tomb-groups for the first time. East Greek pottery in Etruria is the object of a full-scale study in Les ciramiques de la Grece de l'est et leur diffusion en Occident (Paris, CNRS; Naples, Centre Jean Berard, 1978: 150-212, with pls lxxvi-lxxxix, figs. 1-90) by M. Martelli Cristofani, who has also brought statistical order to the whole question of Greek imports into Etruria in the key century between 630 and 530 (St. Etr. xlvii [1979] 37-52). Treatments of indi- vidual painters include the same author's Feoli Painter (Prospettiva xi [Oct. 1977] 2-12), the St Louis Painter (J. G. Szilagyi, Acta Class. Univ. Scient. Debrecen. x-xi [1974-75] 5-14), both Etrusco-Corinthian, and a major re-assessment of the Etruscan bf Paris Painter by Lise Hannestad (Hist. Filos. Medd. Dan. Vid. Selsk. xlvii 2 [1974]; followers: ibid. xlvii 4 [1976]). Etruscan studies have always lent themselves to the production of corpora. The latest addition to the cate- gories currently receiving treatment is that constituted by the miniature stone sarcophagi for cremation burials which are particularly characteristic of Volterra between the late 3rd century and the Augustan period: M. Cristofani et al., Corpus delle urne etrusche di eta ellenistica, I: Urne volterrane, 1: I complessi tombali (Florence: Centro Di, 1975). The importance of this project is summarized for English readers by L. Bonfante in Arch. News (Tallahassee) vi 4 (1977) 125-7. A smaller class, the 'urne a bauletto' characteristic of Veii, is discussed by F. Roncalli in the first issue of the PerugianNuovi Quaderni (i [1979] 157-67). Among other corpora, work on the international Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum is in progress under the auspices of the Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici; and the first fascicule of G. Bordenache Battaglia, Le Ci,te Prenestine appeared in 1979 under the auspices of the CNR Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica. This Centre's activities also include the production of a number of series: A. Emiliozzi's second volume of 'Musei e Collezioni d'Etruria' will be devoted to the Museo Civico di Viterbo, as was her first (La collezione Rossi Danielli, 1974); among recent and forthcoming volumes of 'Ricognizioni archeologiche in Etruria' are M. Cagiano De Azevedo and G. Schmiedt, Tra Bagnoregio e Ferento (1974); P. Baglione, II territorio di Bomarzo</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 (1976); A. Tracchi, Dal Chianti al Valdarno (1978); and II Comune di Orte: esame del territorio e dei materiali archeologici by G. Brunetti Nardi, who has also prepared the third volume, covering the years 1971 to 1975, of the useful Repertorio degli scavi e delle scoperte archeologiche nell'Etruria meridionale. In addition, work continues at the Centre on the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum, and many years of Dr Maristella Pandolfini's life were crowned in 1979 by the publication of the first volume, Indice lessicale, of the Thesaurus Linguae Etruscae. Last but emphatically not least, the Centre has for some years been responsible for a major research programme on the rock cemeteries of Middle Etruria, of which the associated monograph series began in 1970 with Castel d'Asso by E. Colonna di Paolo and G. Colonna; the same authors' impressive Norchia I ap- peared in 1979, and will be followed by Norchia II and III, and by five volumes on the other relevant areas. A brief and splendidly illustrated summary: E. Colonna di Paolo, Necropoli rupestri del Viterbese (Novara: De Agostini, 1978). The rock cemeteries are architecture: in this rather specialized field, Tom Rasmussen and Roger Ling have prepared a second edition of the late Axel Boethius' Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture (Pelican History of Art, 1978), of which the first edition formed part of the well-known survey of Etruscan and Roman architec- ture by Boethius and J. B. Ward Perkins (1970). J. P. Oleson's account of the technical aspects of Etruscan rock-cut tomb architecture (RM lxxxv [1978] 283- 314) was preceded by a valuable series of papers on the construction of Etruscan barrel-vaulted tombs with particular reference to the Tomba Galeotti at Chiusi (St. Etr. xliv [1976] 69-85), non-Italian influence on later tomb design (Arch. News v 4 (1976) 115-24), and on regulatory planning and individual site develop- ment in the cemeteries (J. Soc. Architectural Historians xxxv [1976] 204-18). For painted tombs, E. Poulsgaard Markussen's Painted Tombs in Etruria: a bibliography (Odense: Institut for Klassiske Studier, 1979) is an invaluable catalogue and concordance of the tombs themselves and of the subjects depicted: its present form is provisional, and it is intended that this should lead to a final edition. Lastly, a number of recent papers bear witness to the growing interest in the history of Etruscan studies. English readers in particular will be fascinated by G. Colonna's account of the Romantic activities of the Campanari brothers (St. Etr. xlvi [1978] 81-117), whose 1837 exhibition in Pall Mall introduced Etruscan antiquities to the English-speaking world - an event which led the indefatigable but inaccurate Mrs Hamilton Gray to Etruria in 1839 (George Dennis' Cities and Cemeteries was partly designed to 'supply the de- ficiencies' of her Tours!). In addition to investigations of the Etruscan interests of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (Prospettiva xvii [April 1979] 4-15), M. Cristofani has examined the role of Thomas Dempster, the engaging author of De Etruria regali (written 1616-19, published 1720-26), in MEFRA xc (1978) 577-625; and W. Dobrowolski has shown that the drawings for the plates published under the name of another Scot, James Byres (1734-1817; Hypogaei, 1842), were in fact executed by the Polish painter Franciszek Smuglewicz (1745-1807: Bull. Mus. Nat. Varsovie xix [1978] 91-119). Southern Etruria. The appointment of Dr M. A. Fugazzola Delpino to the post of'specialist Inspector for Prehistory' in the Villa Giulia Superintendency opens up exciting possibilities in the pre-Etruscan field: she is the author of Testimonianze di cultura appenninica nel Lazio (Florence: Sansoni, 1976; JRS lxix [1979] 212 f.) and of a survey of the Proto-Villanovan (in D. and F. R. Ridgway, eds., Italy before the Romans [London 1979] 31-51; add now her and F. Delpino's paper on the Final Bronze Age in 'Lazio settentrionale' - Southern Etruria - in: Atti della XXI Riunione Scientifica dell'stituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria 1977 [1979] 275- 319). Of the many pre- and proto-historic 'scavi e scoperte' effected under her aegis for the Superintend- ency (alone or in collaboration with other official bodies) between 1974 and 1979, she has kindly drawn my attention to the following: Caprarola, Monte Venere: excavation in the area of a cave that has yielded Middle Neolithic material, and a hut settlement of the Middle Bronze Age (Apennine). Nazzano, Colle di S. Antimo: excavation of structures on an extensive artificial terrace, with material mainly in the range Orientalizing to late Imperial, with some Villanovan; nearby, a stratified Neolithic-Bronze Age sequence. Copper and Early Bronze Age material is reported from the area of Mont- alto di Castro (Torre Crognola) in the territory of Vulci; it includes Beaker sherds. Lago di Bracciano: planning, drawing and photography of the material recovered from two submerged Bronze Age villages. Allumiere: exca- vation of a hut village with a stratified sequence from the Neolithic to the Recent Bronze Age (Tufarelle), to which is also assigned a square tumulus built of large blocks (Montejanne), excavated in 1978 by Dr Fugazzola Delpino and Professor R. Peroni (University of Rome) and of immense significance for the emergence of social differentiation attested by the 'edificio monumentale' at Luni sul Mignone (which, pace its Swedish excavators, is not Iron Age: D. Ridgway, Erasmus xxxi [1979] 491- 5). Two more tumuli, excavated at Tolfa (Cicugnola), are attributed to the Middle Bronze Age. Capodimonte, Monte Bisenzo: excavation of Proto-Villanovan and Villanovan huts and of Etruscan and later houses, yielding abundant material from the Final Bronze Age onwards. Sasso di Furbara (Campo del Fico) in the territory of Cerveteri: discovery of a Final Bronze Age necropolis, and recovery of a Proto-Villanovan biconical urn. The map of Southern Etruria in the Final Bronze Age (Fugazzola Delpino and Delpino, cit., 296 fig. 7) now boasts no less than 91 find-spots. The work at Monte Bisenzo (Capodimonte) is particularly significant for the light it throws on the notorious problems of 'attardamento culturale' in the interior. In the past, the early stage at Bisenzio has been defined as representing a 'sub-enea' prolongation of the Bronze Age, and equated with material from the Monti della Tolfa; on this ana- lysis, Proto-Villanovan could not fail to be prolonged in the interior to the point of at least partial contempor- aneity with the earlier Villanovan of the mainstream centres. For at least one school of thought, furthermore, emphasis on the similarities seen in the earliest material from the Bisenzio cemeteries to Proto-Villanovan on the one hand and to the earliest material from Rome and Latium on the other has indicated an actual emigration from Latium to the shores of Lake Bolsena. In reality, 63</page><page sequence="11">64 D. RIDGWAY however, there are no parallels with Latial material that are at the same time peculiar to earlier Bisenzio and inexplicable in terms of a common derivation - pre- sumably via Tarquinia - from Allumiere (G. Colonna in Popoli e Civilta, cit. ii, 297). The principal difference between the early Villanovan stage at inland Bisenzio and those of mainstream Tarquinia and Veii would in fact appear to reside precisely in the different relation- ship with the preceding Final Bronze Age Proto-Villa- novan cultural stage: continuity and gradual change at Bisenzio; caesura and radical re-organization elsewhere. The concept of 'attardamento culturale' now appears to be valid for Bisenzio in the 9th century, to which may be assigned various ceramic forms, a number of cult and ritual features, and arguably certain aspects of social organization. The latter are suggested by the multiplicity of scattered settlements, not yet centralized, that is emerging from current field-work in the area: this is typical of the Final Bronze Age elsewhere, and, taken with the other features, is thus indicative of a slow Final Bronze - Early Iron Age transition. History appears to repeat itself at Bisenzio in the 7th century, during which the production of painted pottery continues on stereotyped Geometric lines, outmoded elsewhere. In sharp contrast, the 8th century - and par- ticularly its second half- yields evidence for a rich network of contacts between Bisenzio and the main- stream centres, and demonstrates that it played an important part in the diffusion of advanced culture towards the interior. Relations between Bisenzio and Vulci stand out as especially significant now, and are shown in the flourishing production at Bisenzio of painted pottery derived ultimately from Euboeo-Cycladic Late Geometric models, in an artistic milieu that seems to have its epicentre at Vulci. A magnificent crater, perhaps by the Euboean Cesnola Painter himself, has recently come to light at Pescia Romana (F. Canciani, Dial. Arch. viii [1974-75] figs. 6, 7) in the territory of the latter centre; a degenerate version of the same painter's favourite motif (rampant goats flanking the 'tree of life') appears on an unprovenanced Italo-Geometric barrel vase, now in the Metropolitan Museum (inv. no. 1975.363). In addition, the funerary material at Bisenzio itself shows a substantial body of cultural affinities that are redolent of contact with a wide range of other centres and thus indicate early exploitation of the natural North-South land-route constituted by the valleys of the Tiber, Sacco, Liri and Volturnus rivers. The signifi- cance of this route is confirmed by the differences be- tween the 8th century repertoires of Bisenzio and of the sites around the modern town of Bolsena on the other side of the lake; such differences probably foreshadow the later territorial distinction between the Roman municipia of Volsinii and Visentium (G. Colonna, St. Etr. xli [1973] 63; the above reflections are prompted by F. Delpino's sensitive analysis of the Early Iron Age at Bisenzio, Mem. Linc.8 xxi [1977] 453-93; St. Etr. xlv [1977] 39-49). In 1976 and 1977, Danish excavations were carried out at Monte Becco in continuation of two earlier campaigns in 1971 and 1972; the site is near Lago di Mezzano (about 8 km. west of Lago di Bolsena), on the border between the territories of Vulci and Volsinii. I am grateful to Professor Ingrid Strbm, now of the University of Copenhagen, for the following account: 'Three phases of habitation can be distinguished. I: from about 700 B.C. (no earlier remains having been found) until about 480. The finds are of domestic as well as of religious or votive character; they include a small bronze figurine of a bull, fragments of a large bird figure in terracotta and a fragment of a Phoenician glass phiale. The site suffered violent destruction, dated from Attic pottery to about 480, and seems to have been un- inhabited for the next fifty years or so. II: from about 430 to about 300. To this period belongs a stone-built cistern on top of the hill, filled with fragments of very large pithoi and heavy tiles which suggest the existence of magazines, and a trapezoidal ashlar construction of tufo blocks in the north-east corner of the hill. Only the two bottom layers are preserved, but these remains of a monumental construction as well as fallen ashlar walls in smaller tufo blocks elsewhere on the hill suggest that the site was again of some importance now. This phase also ended in violent destruction, dated from many fragments of Etrusco-Campanian stamped ware to around 300 or shortly afterwards. III: primitive ramparts of local unworked stone are erected along the north and east sides of the hill, overlying the tufo ashlar construc- tion to the north-east. The pottery in and above these ramparts is of the same type as the latest pottery else- where on the hill. Apparently this phase was very short, and possibly devoid of permanent buildings; it does not seem to be perceptibly later than the end of the second phase. Together with the ditches on the western side of the hill, the features suggest some kind of primitive defence. The date of the final destruction, shortly after 300 B.C., suggests a connection with the Roman campaigns in Etruria. It is tempting to see the two latest habitation phases of Monte Becco in terms of Livy's reference (ix 41,6) to the capture and demolition of some of the Volsiniensium castella by Publius Decius; if so, the final phase may represent temporary arrange- ments, hastily made at some stage prior to the final Roman conquest of the area'. Through the good offices of Professor Carl Nylander (who succeeded C. E. Ostenberg as Director of the Swedish Institute in Rome in 1979) I have received the following report by Alvar Viden on the Swedish exca- vations at Acquarossa (AR 1973-74, 51): 'Three more campaigns of excavation have taken place during the last five years, in 1974, 1975, and 1978. The 1974 campaign was directed at solving some chrono- logical and stratigraphical problems in the "monumental" area (Zone F) as well as in one of the habitation areas (Zone A). In the 1975 and 1978 campaigns the aim of the exploration was to find out whether a plateau (Pian del Sale) to the north of the main acropolis and at a lower level also constitutes a part of the Etruscan habitation. Several foundation walls were found in the trial trenches and an area of about 500 m2 was opened in 1978. In this area (Zone N) five different buildings orientated according to a roughly rectangular system were located and partly excavated. The buildings were tentatively dated to the middle of the 6th century B.C. Five further tombs of the Late Iron Age necropolis were excavated in a short rescue campaign, also in 1978. In addition, it appears from surface finds that the inhabited area of the Etruscan town at Acquarossa extended fur- ther to the south-west (covering at least part of the Campo dei Pozzi) than was earlier realized. A preliminary</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Fig. 10 Fig. 11 report of the 1975 campaign has appeared in Op. Rom. xi (1976) 29-37 (C. E. Ostenberg), accompanied by reports on the cooking stands and painted architectural terracottas (C. Scheffer and C. Wikander). The prelimi- nary report of the 1978 campaign will appear in Op. Rom. xiii. The final publication of one of the habitation areas (Zone A) is nearly ready for the press. Shortly forthcoming are the publications of three more habi- tation areas (Zones D, E and G). Five monographs concerning acroteria, roofing tiles, painted architectural terracottas, architectural terracottas with relief decor- ation and cooking stands will appear within a year or two. Our plans for the immediate future are mainly concerned with the work of conservation at the site itself'. Meanwhile, work proceeds apace on the definitive publications of the earlier Swedish excavations at San Giovenale and at Luni sul Mignone (AR 1967-68, 40), of which a number of fascicules have now appeared in the Skrifter utgivna series (respectively xxvi and xxvii). Mention was made above of a major research pro- gramme concerning the area of the rock cemeteries in Middle Etruria. In this evocative area, Dr A. Morandi (to whom I am grateful for information and photographs) directed the excavation of twelve chamber tombs for the Superintendency in 1979; they are situated in the Casetta area, about 2 km. north of Blera, on a plateau above the rock cemetery, where an extensive necropolis of the late 7th-early 6th centuries has recently been identified. Tomb II, intact, contained more than 60 vases (Fig. 10); Tomb III, previously excavated by clandestini, incorporates a stone 'cushion' or head-rest (Fig. 11). Tomb IX is of notable architectural interest, incorporating a dromos with steps and two funerary Fig. 12 beds (Fig. 12); its contents, rich in pottery, were found intact. Also at Blera, Dr S. Quilici Gigli has published the impressive results of a field survey conducted between 1969 and 1973; it consists of 490 copiously illustrated catalogue entries concerning urban remains and 'viabilita' (Blera: Topografia antica della cittia e del territorio, Mainz: von Zabern, 1976; JRS lxix [1979] 214).

Fig. 16 Etruscan tombs at Tarquinia (AR 1967-68, 40); more than 1200 chambers (a number of them painted) have been found in the Calvario locality, and between 1975 and 1977 the Superintendency commissioned Dr Richard Linington to conduct a series of soundings there. The resulting technical information concerning the tumuli over the chambers, probably of 6th-5th century date, is important: but too complex to be summarized here. No less significant is the evidence yielded below the level of the tumuli (Fig. 13) for a much earlier village of more than twenty huts (Fig. 14), of which four have been completely excavated; the material found in them is undoubtedly of early Villanovan type, not later than the mid-8th century (R. E. Linington et al., St. Etr. xlvi [1978] 3-23 -whence Figs. 13, 14). The Superintendency has continued work at the Greek sanctuary of Gravisca (AR 1973-74, 49-51), the port of Tarquinia, with the collaboration of Professor Mario Torelli; the latter has summarized the complex building history of the sanctuary and the evidence for the Greek and subsequently Etruscan cults there (Par. Pass. xxxii [1977] 398-458). Since 1976, Dr Boitani informs me that work has been concentrated on the further clarification of the structures of the sanctuary's first phase (600-480). Post-holes and hearths suggest the presence of temporary buildings of some kind. West of the shrine of Aphrodite, further trenches and bothroi have come to light; they contain the remains of sacrifices and the by now usual range of anathemata (Figs. 15, 16), especially East Greek (on which see the papers by M. Torelli, F. Boitani Visentini and M. Slaska in Les ceramiques de la Grece de l'est et leur diffusion en Occident [Paris-Naples 1978] 213-230 with pls. xc-ci; and also A.

I am indebted to Dr Francesca Melis of the University N Fig. 15 i *. , ' . .' , //i</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 of Rome for the following information about progress at the Etruscan sanctuary of Pyrgi. Between 1974 and 1976, the magazine at Santa Severa was re-organized and enlarged, and much material was catalogued, drawn and photographed. The next instalment of the exca- vation report (NSc forthcoming: the 1969-71 cam- paigns) was submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1979: it will cover the contents of the two wells associ- ated with Temple A (AR 1973-74, 48), complete the study of Temple B (Fig. 17: pronaos and cella, from the south) and extend the treatment of the piazza around and between the two temples. The area around Temple B was investigated in three short campaigns between 1977 and 1979. In addition, as predicted by geophysical Fig. 17 Fig. 18 prospection in 1962, a wall of tufo blocks was identified on the south side of the complex; although the sig- nificance of this feature is still not wholly clear, it is thought that it may constitute the sanctuary's southern boundary. The western limit, meanwhile, is now estab- lished; and two-period structures of uncertain signifi- cance are being investigated in front of Temple B. In 1974, a joint team of archaeologists and divers from the Istituto di Studi Liguri and the American Academy in Rome surveyed the underwater remains (J. P. Oleson, J. Field Archaeology iv [1977] 297-308). Northern Etruria and Northern Italy. Dr Giuliano de Marinis kindly provides details of an impressive Orient- alizing chamber tomb excavated by him for the Florence Superintendency in 1978, at S. Angelo a Bibbione near S. Casciano Val di Pesa (Fig. 18). This adds many new features to the range of Etruscan funerary architecture; sadly, however, little remained of the contents -just enough, in fact, to assign this monument to the third quarter of the 7th century. On the Tuscan projects mentioned in the previous report (AR 1973- 74, 55 ff.), the following publications are of especial interest: Roselle: gli scavi e la mostra (Pisa: Pacini editore 1978, for the Superintendency), an excellent summary and guide; and, on the archaic Etruscan sanctuary at Poggio Civitate near Murlo (Siena): P. Gregory Warden on a decorated terracotta stand in RM lxxxiv (1977) 199-210; J. Neils on the terracotta gorgoneia, ibid. lxxxiii (1976) 1-29; K. M. Phillips on Orientalizing gem stones in Par. Pass. fasc. clxxxii (1978) 355-69; Bernard Bouloumie and Antoinette Bouloumie-Marique on coarse pottery and cooking pots in MEFRA xc (1978) 51-131. To these may be added news of important buildings in the 'industrial' zone of Populonia (situated in the extramural Poggio della Porcareccia locality), excavated in 1977-78 by Dr M. Martelli Cristofani (of the Florence Superintendency) and Professor M. Cristofani (Univer- sity of Siena): Prospettiva xvi (1979) 74-6; L Etruria mineraria =Atti del XII Convegno di Studi Etruschi ed Italici 1979, 1-12. The results of these two cam- paigns add much to our knowledge of iron-smelting at Populonia: in particular, they indicate that this activity was already under way there by the second half of the 6th century - long before the 4th century date based on Varro's reference to the transport of iron mineral from Elba to Populonia (Servius ad Aen. x 174). For reasons of space and time, I cannot do justice to the important discoveries and developments north of the Apennines. Nevertheless, two centres must be mentioned. At Bologna, Etruscan Felsina, a start has at last been made on the definitive publication of the classic 19th and early 20th century Iron Age excavations: the late R. Pincelli and C. Morigi Govi (Director of the Museo Civico Archeologico, Bologna), La necropoli villanoviana di San Vitale (1975; JRS lxvii [1977] 225-6); Dr Morigi Govi informs me that work is well in hand on the monographs that will be devoted to the Benacci Caprara and Melenzani cemeteries. Allied with the study of old cemeteries is the excavation of new ones: in 1978, Dr P. Von Eles Masi of the Emilia-Romagna Superintendency directed the excavation of a Villanovan cemetery in via Ca' dell'Orbo, Castenaso. By April 1979, 67</page><page sequence="15">68 D.

I am most grateful to Professors Stella Patitucci and Giovanni Uggeri (University of Bologna) for providing me with photographs, bibliography and the basis of the following notes on their work at Spina (Fig. 19), con- ducted in collaboration with the Superintendency (Professor G. V. Gentili; Dr F. Berti). After the interval of 1974, work was resumed in 1975 to the south of the Canale Collettore Principale di Mezzano. As was already known from previous campaigns, this area was occupied by one of the domestic quarters in the middle of the ancient town (for more detailed plans, with the nomen- clature used below, see St. Etr. xlii [1974] 69-97; ibid. xliv [1976] 402-6). Among the finds from the Classical and Hellenistic layers removed in previous campaigns (Fig. 20), the bottom of an Attic skyphos of the early 4th century inscribed with two Etruscan alphabet series (Fig. 21, 22), and the handle of a plain guttus of the mid-3rd with the stamp Galicos colonos (Fig. 23) are particularly notable. Classical Period: a) Sector 9.II A-B: two rows of foundation piles running at right angles (NE-SW and NW-SE) were revealed under the lowest house floor (1975); b) Sectors 9.IV-10.I: two superimposed floors, both dated to the second half of the 5th century and including many large hearths, with a layer of sterile clay in between, were removed (1977); c) Sectors 9.I-9.II: in 1979 the removal of the witness- pillars revealed five successive floors, spanning the whole 5th century in date; from the richest context, datable to the second half of the century, come fragments of an Attic rf skyphos and of a St Valentin kantharos (Fig. 24). Archaic Period: a) Sector 9.II A-B: a house dated c. 490 was found in 1975, destroyed by fire. The floor Fig. 20 Fig. 21 Fig. 22 Fig. 23</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND ETRURIA, 1974-1979 Fig. 24 was made of bundles of sticks laid over a 'bonifica' of wooden branches and sticks that had already been neatly laid over a layer of clay; this in turn covered the dune of virgin sand of the proto-historic shore on which the town was built. Crucibles and slag indicated the presence of foundries for bronze smelting and working, confirmed in 1976 and 1978. Underneath, there was a wooden level made of sticks, beams and worked planks (Fig. 25). Among the finds, there was a good deal of Attic bf of early 5th century date (Haimon Group etc.: Fig. 26), as well as buccheroid pottery; b) Sectors 9.IV A-B - 10.I A-B: a house was revealed, with a destruction layer made up of plaster and pebbles over the floor of 500- 490 (1977); this in turn covered a layer of clay over Fig. 26 foundation piles (1978); c) Sector 10.IV A-B: a thick layer of sterile sand over clay, covering a thin floor. In this clay there were two rows of piles at right angles, and many layers of bundles of sticks (1978); d) Sectors 9.I-9.II: under the lowest floor of the Classical period the witness pillars revealed the destruction layer of a house dated 500-490, and various layers of sticks, under which the virgin sand of the dune was reached (1979). On one of these Archaic floors, the remains of a straw basket (Fig. 27) were found. Select Bibliography (in addition to several items in St. Etr.), 1974-79: T.
