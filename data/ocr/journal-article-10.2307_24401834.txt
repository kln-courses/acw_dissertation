<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTICES The object of Mr. H. G. Rawlinson's India : a Short Cultural History (Cresset Press, 30s.) is to enable English readers " to realise the greatness of" India's "past achievements in religion, politics, art and literature ". To this end he gives a general account of Indian cultural development from the earliest times to the present day, fitting it into an outline of general Indian history. With so im mense a subject, selection was the only possible course; significant trends alone could be followed ; and the account of the British period is rightly on a much smaller scale than the rest. Detail has been suppressed, especially long lists of names, in order to avoid confusion ; this has left space for generous quotations from contemporary descrip tions of the courts and cities of the past. The result is not a patch work ; the whole is put together with great literary skill ; and above all Mr. Rawlinson writes with infectious yet judicious enthusiasm of such heroes as Asoka and Akbar, of such masterpieces as the Sakuntala of Kalidasa. Every important movement appears to be included; if the accounts of the intercourse between India and the West in Greek and Roman times and of Sivaji and the Mahrattas are especially attractive in the reading, this is due not to disproportionate treatment, but to the inevitably greater depth of feeling given by Mr. Rawlinson's special studies in these fields. There appear to be few errors or slips.1 The illustrations are admirable. There appears to be one deficiency. Mr. Rawlinson complains that " English people as a whole have been singularly blind to the signifi cance of India's contribution to world-culture ; there has even been a positive distaste, born of prejudice and apathy, for Indian spiritual and aesthetic values." Yet he never gives a general estimate of Indian culture, although his book indicates clearly enough the intellectual and 1 In a quoted translation on p. 240 an early sixteenth-century Portuguese describes a South Indian building as being partly " in the Romanesque style." The architectural term Romanesque does not appear to have come into use in its present sense until the nineteenth century; and the idea of architectural style had probably not passed at this date beyond cultured circles in Florence, Rome, and one or two other Italian cities. On p. 386 : " the mind goes back to similar scenes [of pilgrim] life which must have been enacted on the road to Canterbury in the days when England was still a religious country." This is bad, and presumably was not intended.</page><page sequence="2">1943] SHORT NOTICES 109 moral disparity between England and India : in English eyes the most attractive figures in Indian history are Buddha, who was ultimately rejected by orthodox Hinduism, Asoka, who was forgotten, Akbar, who was an alien. The charges of prejudice and apathy are justifiable only as regards our general ignorance of Indian history and culture ; such distaste as is felt by the educated is based on knowledge—perhaps too superficial knowledge : thus the late Roger Fry describes the Indian as " one of the most completely anti-rationalist civilisations that has ever existed," and, referring especially to Hindu (non-Mohammedan) art, notes a lack of " organising and co-ordinating power," a lack that appears to exist in all manifestations of Hindu life and thought, once a very elementary stage is passed. India is above all the land of the village community; its political history, between the decline of Buddhism and the coming of the Mohammedans, largely a series of fleeting military despotisms, without organisation and without purpose. It is significant that there are no Hindu historians of the pre Mohammedan period. Yet Buddha is the bearer of a message to all mankind ; and Buddha springs from Indian soil. The beneficent effects of Indian influence can readily be seen in Khmer and in Javanese art ; without it they might never have found an adequate means of expression ; although in all that gives art its specific spiritual depth they are as superior to Indian art as is that of the Italian Renaissance to the Greco-Roman and Roman art which was its foster parent. For the West there is too great dis parity for much assimilation to be possible ; but a few western minds— one may instance Goethe, Shelley, and Flaubert1—have been deeply stirred by Indian religion and literature ; and obviously there has been considerable influence in some, minor arts. Whether or not that influence is to be extended, for several reasons besides the disinterested pursuit of knowledge more general study of Indian culture is desirable ; so far as it can be approached through history Mr. Rawlinson has provided an excellent introduction to it. E. S. deB. No one familiar with Dr. T. R. Glover's earlier writings will need any persuasion to turn the pages of this his latest—but we hope not his last—volume of essays, entitled The Challenge of the Greeks and other Essays (Cambridge University Press, 1942, 12s. 6d.). And if they get so far as that they are certain to do more, for it will be a rare page which does not contain some sentence that will lure them on. They need not be specialists in ancient literature or history to profit from Dr. Glover's essays, for he has an uncanny knack of combining dqep and intimate knowledge of classical literature with shrewd comments on the modern world, the fruits of a wide experience of life as well as letters. This collection consists mainly of papers now printed for the first time, but the one which gives the title to the book is a reprint of a 1 For the latter see the article on " Flaubert and India," by M. Jean Seznec, in the Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, vol. 4. These are western criticisms of Indian culture and civilisation; the Indian might well reply that the west is besotted with materialism and the lust of pro gress ; that it is restless ; and that its anthropomorphic monotheism is the vain attempt of finite man to impose his intellectual domination on the multiform and incomprehensible infinite.</page><page sequence="3">110 HISTORY [MARCH B.B.C. broadcast, while an essay full of deep wisdom and bold challenge on " Purpose in Classical Studies " is a presidential address to the Classical Association. The historian, even though his field of study may lie in more modern fields, will find much that will set him thinking profitably even in such essays as " The Greek and the Forest," " The Greek Farmer," " Emporia " (which leads to Greek markets by way of the Grand Trunk Railway and Kingston, Ontario), "Feeding the Athenians," to be read with one on " The Gastronomers," and another on " Iced Water," with its glimpses of wide reading in the literature of the modern as well as the ancient world. It is a miscellaneous collection, and highly provocative, and Dr. Glover is quite able to look after himself. What he says of the Greeks may well stand for his own book : " Some people may not sympathise with these men and their feelings ; then let me say ' So much the better.' You learn more from people who contradict you and challenge your ideas than from people who echo what you say. ' What is the good ', asked a great man, ' of reading a book when you agree with all of it ? ' " C. H. W. Masters of Political Thought. I. Plato to Machiavelli, by Michael B. Foster (1942, Harrap, 10s. 6d.), is the first volume of a projected series of three which initiates yet another experiment in the teaching of political theory. The problem is, perhaps, a more difficult one in American universities than in this country, for there the teaching of the subject is usually by way of a systematic survey of the whole range of theory, and is accompanied by concentrated study of a volume of selected extracts from the classical exponents of political thought. In this country, on the whole, students concentrate upon a few original works read in their entirety, and the use of selected extracts is not encouraged. The editor of this new series (Professor Ε. M. Saite) recognises that, ideally, original works should take the place of the source-book, but he argues that according to American methods this is impracticable : the ideal must give way to the practicable. The result is the series now planned, in which a few great political thinkers from Plato to Machia velli are represented by long extracts from their works which are elucidated by a running commentary dovetailing the extracts together. In this first volume Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Aquinas and Machiavelli are well represented, but early medieval thought is not adequately considered, and the reader will think of some important theorists samples of whose works ought not to have been omitted. While there may well be criticism of a scheme authorising students to neglect reading complete texts, that is not a reason for detracting from the work done by the author of this volume. The passages he has selected are representative, and there is much able and shrewd commentary in his book. Nor should the most casual student be left with the idea that there is nothing more to be done. Each section is provided with useful bibliographies and information about the texts. In his Wales : A Study in Geography and History (University of Wales Press, 3s. 6d.), Mr. E. G. Bowen has incorporated the material which he used in a series of thirty broadcast lessons to schools. The result is an admirably clear and concise treatment of a subject which</page><page sequence="4">1943] SHORT NOTICES 111 has hitherto been handled very badly. The three divisions : Physical Geography, Historical Geography and Economic Geography, sufficiently indicate the nature of the book, whose value is enhanced by a series of forty-eight pictures, maps and diagrams, and a carefully selected bibliography. D. W. Miss Elsa de Haas' short work of some 175 pages, including appendices, plates, bibliography and index on the Antiquities of Bail, (Columbia Univ. Press : 15s. Qd.) is packed with matter based on original sources, among which the Pipe and Close Rolls and various manuscripts of the Registrum Brevium figure prominently. It is the result of many years of patient labour in America and England, where sources have had to be examined and drawn upon for this study of the administration of bail in England. The author states that there is no attempt to prove any particular thesis, but indicates support to the view of " those scholars who find the origin of bail in the contract situation arising out of the wergeld payment procedure." Theories of the continental origins of bail are first discussed, and then we are taken through the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods. In the first of these periods the development of the idea of a'surety who becomes responsible for the payment of the wergeld—a quasi trustee, as it were, for the debtor to the creditor—into one who stands surety for another in charges of crime, is seen through the succession of laws of the Anglo-Saxon kings. In the Norman period, the surety system, which had arrived at the tithing stage in Anglo-Saxon times, reached its highest development evolving in Frankpledge, a Norman adaptation of an Anglo-Saxon or Danish institution. But the author makes a clear distinction between frankpledge and bail. Abundant evidence is put forward to show that although thé whole tithing, or frankpledge, did act as pledge or surety, much more frequently pledges are chosen as sureties for the particular case in question, and thus there is no necessary connection between frankpledge and bail. The frank pledge presented offenders; the bail sureties' responsibility was to have the individual at the appointed time before the Court. The second half of the book deals with " Writs governing Release," and of these the earliest and best known is the writ " de homine reple giando." As more restrictions became placed on the issue of this writ —more crimes being included in the category of those irreplevisable— other writs were invented, and there is discussion of the " de odio et atia," the " deponendo per ballium," and the writ of mainprise or " de manucaptione." The years between the Assize of Clarendon, 1166, which established the presentment jury and the itinerant justices, and the Statute of Westminster I of 1275, provide the period in which the principle of bail secures a permanent place in the body of the Common Law of England.1 1 There is one statement which might lead a reader astray. Speaking of the Register of Writs sent to Ireland in 1227, the author writes (p. 64), " Maitland estimates that the Register enclosed is an old one, perhaps forty years younger than Granvill's treatise, and dating from the middle of the twelfth century." On Plate A, which reproduces a page of this Register, the date is given as " middle of the 12th cent." What Maitland writes is, " The Register that it gives is about forty years younger than Granvill's treatise and affords the means of measuring</page><page sequence="5">112 HISTORY [march The seven plates and the bibliography add to the value of this well prepared, well-documented, and well-produced work on the " Anti quities of Bail." W. H. H. Sister Mary Kishpadgh has taken up a little explored subject for her doctoral dissertation in The Feast of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary in the Temple (Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D.C. ; $2.00). This feast was only effectively established in the West in the late fourteenth century, after Philip de Mézières returned from crusade and composed an Office of the Presentation of Our Lady. The formal introduction of the feast in the west was in 1372, and its official extension throughout Europe until it became of universal observance in the Roman Church in 1585 was brought about by papal legislation. But the feast has a long history in the East, and it was observed in the West as well during the earlier period, e.g., in monasteries in England before the Norman Conquest. The author of this book has brought together the literary and historical sources relating to the culture and the feast in the Eastern Church and in the West before 1372, and after a detailed study of Philip de Mézières and his Office, traces the growth of the cultus in the late Middle Ages. The essay is an admirable survey of the literature of the subject and contains a valuable bibliography. It is a definite contribution to the history of a little-known aspect of medieval life. The Board of Celtic Studies of the University of Wales has given students of both Welsh and English medieval history valuable source materials in these two volumes. Both are excellent examples of the best type of scholarship in Welsh history, and both will take their place as indispensable evidence for the history of thirteenth-century Wales and the Edwardian Conquest. In the first of them (Littere Wallie. Edited with an introduction by J. G. Edwards. University of Wales, Cardiff. 15s.) Mr. Edwards has printed a set of documents which form part of a manuscript volume originally found among thé archives of the Exchequer. It is a register of miscellaneous documents, a formulary book originally made for the use of a civil servant. It was put together in the reign of Edward I. The latest document it contains seems to be one from the year 1292, and the editor hazards the guess that it was probably completed before 1295, otherwise it must surely have contained some mention of the great Welsh rebellion which took place at that time. The documents connected with Wales in this volume provide one of the most important single collections of material extant for the history of Wales in the thirteenth century. They cover the years 1217-92, and therefore deal with the period which was the most restless and the most formative period in the history of medieval Wales. Their value as illustrations of all kinds of problems is very great, but the difficulty for an editor is to decide which of them needs comment in an introduction. Mr. Edwards has settled the question the growth of law during an important period—the period of the Great Charter " (Col. Pap. π, 130). This surely means forty years later, or younger than Granvill's work (c. 1187), not forty years older, which is the meaning taken by the author to make the Register date from the middle of the twelfth century.</page><page sequence="6">1943J SHORT NOTICES 113 by limiting his remarks to the topic which overshadows all else in the period, the career of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. In so doing he has been able to make a telling contribution to Welsh history, to the study of Llywelyn's principality in relation to Wales and England, and to his policy between the years 1272 and 1282. Not all the documents are novelties : many of them have been previously printed in such collec tions as Rymer's Foedera, but the editor has wisely decided to print all of them in full, on the ground that it will be convenient for the student to have a complete text available in one volume, and also because previous editions leave much to be desired in accuracy. The other volume (The Welsh Assize, Boll 1277-84. Edited with an introduction by J. C. Davies. University of Wales, Cardiff. 15s.) makes a contribution of a more specific kind to the history of the Edwardian conquest. Assize Roll 1147 is significant because'it covers the years 1277-84, and contains the majority of the cases which came before' a commission of oyer and terminer appointed for Wales and the Marches under the terms of the treaty of Aberconway, as well as a number of assizes and inquests relating to Wales and the Marches. This material· throws new fight on Edward's treatment of Wales before the conquest, and adds much information about marcher laws and customs. It affords the first comprehensive account of cases relating to Wales and the Marches pleaded according to English and Welsh law, and studied in relation to patent rolls, plea rolls, and assizes and inquisitions may be made the basis of a very full acount of the •administration of those parts. The editor has attempted to give as much of the material in full as is possible within the limits of his space : those parts of the roll which are of special significance are given in a full Latin text : such parts of particular pleas as illustrate points of Welsh or marcher law are given in Latin, while the remainder of the plea has been translated omitting only repetitions of pleading. There is a long introduction which is a definite contribution to the history of law and administration in Wales in the thirteenth century. It is to be hoped that Mr. Davies will con tinue his work in this field arid provide more material of a similar kind, for it is essential to a sound understanding of the history of Wales at a critical and by no means an easy period of its history. C. H. W. The third volume in the publications of the recently formed Anglo Norman Text Society (Anglo-Norman Letters and Petitions. Edited by Dominica M. Legge. 1941. Oxford : Blackwell. 63s.) is an important contribution to the source material for the reign of Richard II. Miss Dominica Legge, who was entrusted with the preparation of the volume, has previously shown her skill in handling legal and other documents of this nature, and her editorial work in this volume will enhance her reputation for Anglo-Norman scholar ship. It is regrettable that the death of Miss M. V. Clarke deprived her of the co-operation of a scholar who had made the period her own, knew a great deal about this manuscript, and would undoubtedly have been a great help in dealing with the historical part of this volume. These documents come from an All Souls manuscript, which has No. 107.—vol. χχνπι. ι</page><page sequence="7">114 HISTORY [MARCH long been known and used, although only about a dozen out of the four hundred and fifty odd documents have previously been printed. The part now published consists of specimen documents falling within the period 1390-1410, which were brought together into a formulary for use as a precedent book for a royal official. Who he was is not known for certain, despite several attempts which have been made to identify him. The editor has boldly gone over the ground afresh in her intro duction, and the arguments she produces in favour of John Stevenes, a clerk in the service of the Archbishop of Canterbury and of the king, seems to be very strong, if not quite conclusive. The importance of the documents for historians of the fourteenth century lies in their mis cellaneous character. They include signed letters of Richard II's reign—of great value because of the disappearance of the signet records— letters from the Treasury, and private letters from the correspondence of Archbishop Arundel and Bishop Despencer of Norwich. To attempt an analysis of the historical significance of the contents of these documents would be impossible within ordinary limits, but, as the editor says, the diversity of the contents means that there is some thing that will attract the notice of every historian of the period, how ever much of a specialist he may be, and the collection should become a happy hunting ground for all. Miss Legge's editorial work includes a scholarly introduction on the manuscript, and some useful notes and references to individual documents, together with a good glossary and an index of names and places. It is a pity that she did not complete her work with a detailed subject index, which is essential if so miscellane ous a collection is to be made really accessible. C. H. W. Six years ago Mr. Blake published his European Beginnings in West Africa, 1454-1578, an admirable work that at once took its place as the standard account of its subject. Now he has edited for the Hakluyt Society Europeans in West Africa, 1450-1560 (Second Series, lxxxvi and lxxxvii. xxxvi + 461 pp. £2 14s.), a collection of the more important documents on which that book was based. Most of them will be new to English readers : nearly a third are printed here for the first time. The volumes are divided into three parts, each of which has an authoritative editorial introduction. Section I deals with Portuguese enterprise in West Africa from 1462 to 1560. Among the most interest ing new documents it contains are the grant of trading rights to the inhabitants of Sâo Thomé (no. 13), which shows how extensive were their privileges and what a great place the islands was intended to hold in the Portuguese empire, and those relating to the factory of Arguim in Mauretania—the first post ever established by Europeans in tropical Africa—and the slave trade on which it depended (nos. 25, 39, 40 and 44). In the second section Mr. Blake sets out the main evidence so far. discovered for the early rivalry of Castile and Portugal in West Africa between 1453 and 1480. He is far from claiming that his account is definitive : rather, he suggests that among Spanish archives there may be important documents relating to the Castilian voyages to Guinea in this period, " records whose full significance has so far escaped the</page><page sequence="8">1943] SHORT NOTICES 115 notice of students intent only upon investigating the Columbine voyages." Section III, "The Early English Voyages to West Africa," will be of the widest interest to students in this country. It includes a num ber of valuable new documents, such as the English merchants' claim to freedom of trade in Guinea (no. 140)—a thorough-going statement of the theory of " effective occupation " as against Portuguese exclusive - ness ; Martin Frobisher's highly-coloured account of Portuguese rule on the Gold Coast (no. 141) ; and a series of extracts from the records of the High Court of Admiralty, revealing a new phase in the history of the English Barbary trade (nos. 134-137 and 150-155). Besides these documents, Mr. Blake has printed here, with a useful if not exhaustive editorial commentary, all the relevant passages from Hakluyt, beginning with the projected English voyage to Elmina in 1482 and ending with Towerson's third expedition in 1558. The narra tives of the African voyages are not among the finest in Hakluyt, though they contain some pleasant things—Richard Eden's delicious account of elephants, for example ; but without the information they furnish, how little of the story we should know ! It is right that an English reader's last feeling on finishing these volumes, after one of admiration for the editor's patience and skill, should be one of gratitude to the memory of Richard Hakluyt, who alone hag preserved for us so many of the records of the earliest impact of England on Africa. J. S: John Duke of Albany (1481-1536), who played so great a part in the history of Scotland during the minority of James V, certainly merited a biography, and with the aid of the Carnegie Trust in publica tion Miss Maria W. Stuart has produced a life of The Scot who was a Frenchman (Wm. Hodge, 1940, 12s. 6d.). The author has attacked her task with relish, and has done real service in calling attention to the period when Albany, having quitted Scotland for good, showed himself an active diplomatist in France and Italy. She has turned to good account some of the " Letters and Papers " (Henry VIII) which have so far received little attention, and she has drawn also upon some unpublished material in the Register House in Edinburgh. Her historical equipment is not, however, equal to her enthusiasm. Her references to the history of France and of Scotland, and to the titles of some of the actors in her drama, show a lack of background ; her quotations from Latin authors and even from the Acts of the Parlia ments of Scotland do not inspire confidence ; she leaves much of the sixteenth-century French untranslated. Her selection of appendices is odd. There was no real reason to reproduce poems by Dunbar and Skelton, or documents from Teulet's collection ; and while one or two of the pieces are of interest, the reader is in some cases left to speculate as to their origin. It must be added that the writer is uncritical. She produces, apparently in good faith, as a voucher for the antiquity of the Franco-Scottish Alliance, an " Act of Louis XIV's Reign " which assumes the reality of the treaty between Charlemagne and Achaius ; and although she cites Hannay as an authority, her description of the erection of the " Court of Session or College of Justice " bears little</page><page sequence="9">116 HISTORY [march trace of Hannay's doctrine on this important matter. Rightly to assess the importance of Albany in a diplomatic world of great com plexity is, admittedly, a very difficult task; and the good sense, the good taste and the obvious hard work of the author have not availed to produce a satisfying biography. J. D. M. Dr. James M. Aitken's The Trial of George Buchanan before the Lisbon Inquisition (Oliver and Boyd, 1939; 12s. 6d.) is a close and scholarly examination of an episode in this great Scottish humanist's life, when his teaching at the Royal College at Coimbra, Portugal, was abruptly interrupted by arrest and trial before the Inquisition for heresy. Buchanan was arrested in August 1550, and the lengthy pro ceedings against him ended with his sentence in July 1551. He was released from imprisonment in a monastery in December 1551, end finally allowed to leave Lisbon at the end of February 1552. The documents on which Dr. Aitken's study is based were discovered half a century ago—too late to be used by Hume Brown in his biography of Buchanan—and were subsequently published. The evidence is therefore not new, but has been submitted to a fresh and careful examina tion. The core of Dr. Aitken's book is an amended text, with accom panying translation into English, of the two general statements in Latin which Buchanan wrote by way of defence while his several examinations were proceeding. Dr. Aitken has added his own valuable commentary in the form of generous annotations, has prefaced the documents with a reprint of Buchanan's brief Latin autobiography and with a study of the Inquisitorial process and the problems it raises, and has appended a series of discussions of other problems. Though the character and arrangement of the book make it essentially a work for scholars, anyone interested in Buchanan will find that it reconstructs, so far as the evidence allows, the story of important but obscure years in his life. Dr. Aitken holds—probably with justice—-that Buchanan at that time was a Catholic Reformer rather than a Protestant. J. Ε. N. Privy Councillors in the House of Commons, 1604-29, by David K. Willson (University of Minnesota Press ; 365.), is yet another contribu tion to the parliamentary history of the seventeenth century by one of the many American students who owe their interest in the constitutional history of the Stuart period to the stimulating influence of Professor Wallace Notestein. The theme he has chosen to work on is an interesting one, the importance of which has been suspected rather than proved by earlier students of the period. It is well known that one of the ways in which the Tudor sovereigns controlled and directed parliamentary activities was through the little group of councillors and officials who were members of the House of Commons. This group, acting for the monarch, who was thus able to remain in the background, were effec tively the leaders of the House, and under Elizabeth they acted as a buffer when the Commons began to make demands for more indepen dence. With the coming of the Stuarts they lost that position and became spokesmen for the Crown in a House which they could no longer control. Mr. Willson's study is an attempt to explain the reasons for</page><page sequence="10">1943] SHORT NOTICES 117 that change. His book, however, does more than that. The opposi tion of the Commons to the Councillors was a pointer in the direction of the later theory of ministerial responsibility, and he has used his work to review the development of parliamentary procedure during this period. He brings out very clearly the way in which the Council pre pared for a meeting of parliament, and his interesting chapter on the Earl of Salisbury as parliamentary manager for the Crown and his detailed study of the meeting of .the parliaments of 1614 and 1621 are enlightening contributions to parliamentary history. He brings out very clearly the way in which councillors gradually lost their influence in the Commons. As is to be expected from one of Professor Notestein's students, Mr. Willson has drawn widely on unpublished parliamentary diaries for his material, while he has used with good effect the sumptuous collection of materials made available in Professor Notestein's publica tions of Commons Debates. He has produced a monograph which makes distinctive contributions to parliamentary history, especially to the development of parliamentary procedure during the early Stuart period. Pending the coming of a time when it will be possible to publish an ample history of the National Anthem, Dr. Percy A. Scholes has pub lished his findings in " God Save the King ! " the History and its Romance (Oxford University Press, 1942,2s.). He traces the origin of words and music ; gives the circumstances of the first general adoption of the song ; later variants in the words, with specimens of new versions and parodies ; and accounts of the diffusion of the song in other countries, of some special performances, and of its significance on various occasions. He has little to say about it as part of the nation's propaganda, but shows why it was acclimatised in Germany at the time of the French Revolu tion. In general Dr. Scholes treats the history tactfully, steering skilfully between excessive patriotism and the innumerable opportuni ties for gibing ; he is rather hard on Queen Victoria for doing homage at the tomb of Napoleon. There are a few interesting illustrations. Altogether this is a model of what a popular work should be. Mr. E. G. Forrester has chosen a fruitful subject of study and has produced a useful monograph for students of constitutional history in Northamptonshire County Elections and Electioneering 1695-1832 (1941, Oxford University Press, Milford, 10s). The part of the classical English constitution of the eighteenth century which won most praise from contemporaries and later historians was the representation of the counties, and Mr. Forrester's object has been to test the evidence for this verdict by a close examination of the working of the system in one county where the landed interest was fairly evenly divided on party lines, and was represented by many great territorial families, some of them including outstanding national personalities. His description of the great election contests of the period and his narrative of negotiations during the intervals provide a lively picture of the local intrigues and their reaction upon national politics. The author has used for his work local collections of personal and business letters, election books, committee .notes, personal rough</page><page sequence="11">118 HISTORY [MARCH drafts and memoranda, bundles of bills, account and poll books, as well as printed ballads, newspapers, pamphlets, and scrap books. By skilful piecing together of this rather scrappy material Mr. Forrester has succeeded in producing a readable and interesting study which reveals how the landed interests and Anglicanism expressed themselves in the county in a consistent and enduring Toryism. As Mr. Forrester's analysis shows, they never returned a Whig as knight of the shire for over a century, and only once throughout the period did one of their members hold ministerial office. Owing to the fact that throughout the period Northampton was unusual in having a large number of great territorial magnates possessing estates within its borders, their party divisions and personal jealousies left the electoral control to a large extent in the hands of a squire oligarchy. Hence the county gentry were unahle to maintain their claim of independence against the claims of aristocratic control. Mr. Forrester's book is a good example of the possibilities inherent in a study of national history through local history, and he has made a useful contribution to constitutional studies. The book is well anno tated and there is a convenient select bibliography which will take students further into this interesting subject. In some 260 well-translated pages, enriched by many choice photo graphs and an interesting composite map, Professor Halecki has admirably filled a gap in our historical equipment with his History of Poland (1942, Dent, 15s.). We know that Poland occasioned the second world war, that in it she has played the hero, and that she must gravely complicate the peace. We are proud to have become the seat of her Government and to be fighting by her side on land and sea and in the air. But she remains of all great countries the least known and understood in Britain. Distance, inaccessibility, poverty, differences of language, religion, society and politics—all have combined to keep our two nations apart. Now we find ourselves endowed with a lucid, learned and temperate conspectus of Polish history from the hand best qualified in all the world to write it. Few men will ever know so well as does the author the history, languages and culture of both eastern and western Europe and of the New World. Inspired by the Poland of the Ostra Brama and of Czestochowa, he can condemn " the ill will which accumulated against all the Dissidents " and find the blood-bath of Toruf) revolting. Indeed, the large humanity and the nobility with which the long procession of Polish worthies' sorrows and achievements is surveyed must give the book an abiding value. King Stanislas might well be consoled for a thousand humiliations by the author's just tribute to his manifold initiative and to " the merit of getting the best minds of his epoch to work together around his fas cinating person." " Thanks to Napoleon," we read, " Poland, instead of floundering in oblivion, lived years of true grandeur beyond the tomb; and it is this that the Poles will never forget." After "the saddest century in the whole of our history," despite the Messianic creed of Mickiewicz and the sacred memories of 1863, the quarrel of 1914 between her " two inexorably hostile neighbours " prepared the way for the reborn Poland of 1918. There ended the original edition,</page><page sequence="12">1943] SHORT NOTICES 119 written in French. Professor Halecki's nêw book is itself a historical document of no small value. Reborn Poland was in no way more glorious than in her devotion to learning, and in 1936 a congress of historians met at Warsaw. To mark the occasion, the original book was written. Some three years later the author's home and work in Warsaw were destroyed. He led the literary Poland which side by side with political and military Poland arose in Paris, only to be shattered a few months later. In the spring of 1941, from a professorial chair in the United States, he traced the history of reborn Poland in three invaluable chapters, Resurrection, Reconstruction and Destruc tion. The narrative is marked no less by perfect frankness than by the sympathy which does justice to the most diverse and jarring Polish statesmen and by the faith which finds a silver lining in the darkest. clouds. Its invincible and impeccable fairness, nothing extenuated nor aught set down in malice, lends force to the grim indictment in the final chapter. The Germans, by the spring of 1941, had made Bis marck's " Ausrotten " pale, while in cruel persecution " the red Tsar dom " had surpassed the white. But " that new experience of bound less suffering and misfortune, worse than any other preceding it," leaves Poland a State and not without allies ; she is also a great symbol belonging to universal humanity and a nation " infinitely more conscious of her unity and immortality " than in the half century after 1864. On the Armistice and Independence Day of 1941 Professor Halecki, as a conscientious historian, preserved his final chapter as it stood. We may hope that, like Mickiewicz, he may have reason to believe in the repentance of Poland's most brutal historic foe. W. F. R. The word culture has several figurative meanings; for Professor Thomas J. Wertenbaker in The Golden Age of Colonial Culture (New York University Press; Oxford University Press, 1942, $3.00) it appears to mean chiefly the education, the houses and their furnishings, and the more rational amusements of the well-to-do; indeed, M. Jourdain would very nearly satisfy the requirements, were it not that intellectual achievements are occasionally thrown in as a makeweight. In six lectures Mr. Wertenbaker describes these elements in the life of six eighteenth-century American towns, from Boston to Charleston. He shows how-what was imported from England was modified by the religious, political, social, economic, and geographical conditions in each settlement; and carefully describes the resulting divergences. This is the -most important feature of the book ; the short accounts of the scientific work of such men as Franklin, Clayton, and Garden, are also attractive. There is rather much generalisation of the kind that hardens and formalises the more or less casual habits of a few into rigid laws for all. There is little indication of the size of the groups enjoying this culture, a rather serious deficiency in an account of a development so largely a product of wealth. The English culture of the time—still in Mr. Wertenbaker's sense—is made too uniform; whereas it is probable that Massachusetts was linked with one social group at home and Vir ginia with another, each of these groups having its own peculiarities.</page><page sequence="13">120 HISTORY [MARCH The art-history is old-fashioned on the one hand and on the other neglects the social and economic factors controlling works of art of certain types. Thus the timber buildings of early New England are held to constitute a local architectural tradition, broken when the eighteenth century well-to-do put up brick houses, whose designs were taken from English books on architecture. The use of timber for houses was due not to any artistic purpose, but to economic factors ; when people acquired wealth they moved into masonry; they had done the best they could with timber, but they had not used it for choice. Thé work of American cabinet-makers and silversmiths is very nearly elevated from good craftsmanship—and it appears to have been very good—to the status of a fine art. Such a phrase as " the accepted rules of Georgian architecture " betrays the modern architectural text-book (" L'art de reconnaître les styles ") ; eighteenth century architecture, maugre all the dictators of taste, evolved continuously and declined to be bound by rules. For culture in the humane sense Mr. Wertenbaker has very little space ; the nearest that he gives is lists of books advertised by book sellers or of plays performed by travelling companies ; he makes no attempt to examine from their writings the reading of any of the colon ials, or their understanding and appreciation of what they read. But, slight as it is, the book has much to give to the reader who will con stantly test it by his own knowledge and experience. E. S. de. Β. Two American books on American history, while unsuitable for use in English schools, merit the attention of English teachers of the subject. These are Our United States, by Messrs. J. A. Woodburn, T. F. Moran, and H. C. Hill (1941 edition, Longmans, 10s. 6c?.), and Growth of the American People, by M. W. Jernegan, Η. E. Carlson, and A. C. Boss (1941 edition ; Longmans, 12s. 6d.). The former, intended for boys and girls in " the upper-elementary and junior high-school grades," 4s the more readable of the two ; but the latter, a " senior high school text," is more important not only on account of its greater detail, but also as showing the value attached in America to knowledge of history as a foundation for citizenship. Both books are illustrated, the Growth of the American People the better of the two; and both are liberally provided with excellent maps; these deserve special study. Both attach to every chapter schemes for class work, questions, and so forth, and instructions for further reading. The title and subtitle of Mr. Eric Ecclestone's The Growth of Modern America : a Short History of the United States (Bell, 1942 ; 3s. 6d. ; school edition, 2d. 6s.) diverge so far as to make it desirable to explain that the book is in fact a short general history of the United States with, if anything, comparatively too little attention paid to the most recent period. The interest is mainly political and constitutional, the economic development being described only so far as is necessary for the understanding of the rest ; above all, America is seen as a land of democratic aspiration. The general handling is excellent ; the style is engaging ; adroit use is made of quotations, the sources ranging in time from the Mayflower compact to President Roosevelt's third Inaugural Speech. The book does not appear to be very suitable as a text-book,</page><page sequence="14">1943] SHORT NOTICES 121 but deserves a place in the school library; it should also help the general reader who wants a preliminary outline of American history from the British point of view. The illustrations, consisting of four portraits and some maps and diagrams, are rather inadequate for a text-book.1 The influence of the American past on the present has led Mr. D. W. Humphreys and Miss M. E. Beggs, in Introducing America (Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, 1942, 2s.), to draw from the past " those things which help us to understand America to-day." They hope that " the reader will find this introduction to America interesting enough to make him or her want to find out much more about America's history." Only the book's effect on children and fresh readers can determine how far they have succeeded; it is certainly an excellent introduction to the subject. The authors have both visited America ; they write well and give clear and reasonably simplified accounts of matters of current or recent interest; among many enlightening passages one may note especially that on the relative positions of men and women in America and in this country. The book ends with a short reading list. The production of the book is not so good as could be wished ; it is generally undistinguished and some of the illustrations are feeble ; for the authors' purpose something more attractive is necessary. There is a brief foreword by Professor H. Hale Bellot. In The United States (J. M. Dent, 1942, 2s. 6d.), Mr. George W. Southgate, while treating with special emphasis the constitutional history and the foreign policy of the United States, has in fact rather limited himself to these aspects of the country's history ; and this for a country where social and economic forces have been more openly and immediately active than elsewhere. Hence the merits and the defects of the book : notably an excellent chapter on the constitution and the general insufficiency of the last few chapters. Although it it? rather too short and too annalistic as an introduction to American constitutional history, it should prove a useful supplement to more general works. Dr. C. F. Strong's America Yesterday and To-day : the Story of the American People for Schools (University of London Press, 1942, 2s. 6d.) is excellently designed for its purpose. The dominating geo graphical, social, and economic conditions, are all described; in the historical narrative interest is concentrated on those elements or phases which are most likely to appeal to children's imagination and to hold their interest. Military events have been ruthlessly if necessarily 1 P. 29. Lafayette was of little value for the training of Washington's army; he came to America as a young enthusiast with not very much military experience. P. 69. An " overwhelming Republican victory " in the presidential election of 1860 requires qualification. The gibe about the War Office on p. 29 is rather cheap. Teachers may be interested to note that the conventional account of Lincoln's father has recently been challenged by Mr. L. A. Warren in an article in the Indiana Magazine of History (vol. xxxvm, 1942, pp. 251-64). Mr. Warren shows that the father was an ordinary pioneer farmer and craftsman (he was a carpenter), not particularly feckless or improvident" or poverty-stricken; if anything, possessing some good qualities., but with too little education or training to make much use of them.</page><page sequence="15">122 HISTORY [march sacrificed; a more serious defect is the insufficient attention paid to American political and social idealism. The book is well provided with maps and tables, and is admirably illustrated, though the pictures of the Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower and of Penn making a treat with the Indians (West) might be discarded from text-books. Neither is contemporary with the event depicted and neither has any serious claims as an historical reconstruction. Dr. C. F. Strong in The Story of the American People (Hodder and Stoughton, Ltd. ; University of London Press, 1942, Is. 6d.) set out to provide the general reader with " a book on American history written by an Englishman " ; what he has achieved is a long historical essay, an account of contemporary America as seen by the fight of history, rather than a formal history ; for this reason the descriptive and reflective passages are superior to the narrative, which is at times perfunctory. The description of the land as a whole and the account of the origins of the American Revolution are good ; but the most interesting chapters are those on the Wild West and the end of the Frontier and on the American way of life. The English contribution appears in a power of vision less dazzled by material development and size and success than is common among American writers ; but the questioning and criticism are not so sharp as Mr. Hill's. Readers should not be deterred by the bad style, shambling sentences laden with parentheses and occasionally exemplary grammatical errors ; but what can be expected of an author who can maul a quotation from Leviathan ? The short bibliography gives a useful list of novels, but is less satisfactory for other works. There are many illustrations, rather poorly reproduced ; those from photographs and contemporary representations are well selected, but there are three fanciful recon structions of little value. Mr. C. P. Hill's object in his A History of the United States (Edward Arnold, 1942, 5s. 6d.) is to provide boys and girls of about fifteen or sixteen years of age with an account of the political and economic development of the United States. His account, which comes down to November 1940, is very full so far as material progress and the factors contributory to it are concerned; the chapter on the Sections and Slavery prior to the Civil War and the description of the New Deal are particularly good, though in the former the account of the moral evils of slavery is inadequate. For the period after the Civil War the English point of view is too obtrusive ; attention is paid not so much to the development that has taken place as to the evils that have accompanied it ; and this without enough analysis of what to English eyes appears to be the fundamental weakness of American civilisation, its material ism, its habit of measuring all things by their material value. There is some adverse criticism of the methods of American expansion in the imperialistic period at the opening of the present century; Mr. Hill would probably apply like standards to British achievements in the same period. There appear to be a few unimportant slips in statements relating to other than American history, but none of much account. In the account of the Senate it is not made clear that a third of its members are elected every second year. Log-cabins (pp. 64, 67, 96)</page><page sequence="16">1943] SHORT NOTICES 123 are overworked ; most farmers lived in frame houses. Garland (p. 185) is a misprint for Garfield. As regards style : " these people came to the New World because they were sick of the Old " is slang, and ugly at that. Calhoun " wanted him court-martialled " (p. 102) is an Ameri canism. The word " phenomenal " is invariably misused. There are a few other places where adjustment is desirable. The book is provided with good maps, and an appendix gives a useful account of the political parties. The style is clear and straightforward, but the book may perhaps prove rather advanced for the children for whom it is intended ; ' it should be of service to the general reader who wants a short but detailed history of the United States. The World War in Maps, edited by Mr. George Goodall (Messrs. George Philip &amp; Son, Ltd., 1942, 2s.), consists of thirty-one pages, 10 by 7| inches, of coloured maps, political, military, and economic, with short texts and some statistical information ; the most recent shows the Russian counter-offensive to 30 April 1942. The maps illustrating the various campaigns and those of the Atlantic and Mediterranean are perhaps the best. An, Atlas of the U.S.S.R., by Mr. Jasper H. Stembridge (" Oxford Pamphlets on World Affairs," no. 61 ; Oxford University Press, 1942, éd.), consists of sixteen maps or diagrams, with accompanying text. The maps are inevitably too small in scale and are too littered with symbols showing products and so on ; they are not up to the standard of the clear and informative text. Treitschke's Das Deutsche Ordensland Preussen has often been referred to as a formidable influence upon German political opinion, but since it first appeared in 1862 it has never been translated into Eng lish. Under the title Treitschke's Origins of Prussianism it has been translated by E. and C. Paul (Allen and Unwin, 1942 ; 7s. 6d.). It is interesting as an account of the German thrust into what afterwards be came East Prussia and of the origin of the antagonism between Prussians and Slavs. It reveals, too, the anti-semitism, the worship of the State, the admiration of Prussianism, the conviction that the Hohenzollerns working through Prussia had a divine mission to unify Germany which were the characteristic elements in Trietschke's thought and, through his works, have dominated modern German political ideas. At the age of eighty, " the senior fellow of a very ancient college," who has kept every academic term at Oxford since October 1878, Sir Charles Oman could fairly plead justification for the writing of Memories of Victorian Oxford (Methuen, 15s.). The book is pleasantly written, chatty autobiography such as might have been anticipated from his earlier book of memoirs. Into the thirty-three chapters he has packed much interesting and amusing gossip, and he gives graphic pictures of life at Winchester and New College in the 'seventies, and at All Souls for a considerably longer period. Those who like good univer sity stories, examination howlers, discipline of nineteenth-century senior common rooms, will find plenty to interest them, while students of history will find much material for criticism as well as approval in the more serious passages where Sir Charles delivers his opinions on the nature of history, the history of books, and the Oxford lecture system.</page><page sequence="17">124 HISTORY [march The Indian problem is so prominent that a judicious and well informed survey of Indian conditions must be welcome to many readers. A recent volume by Sir George Schuster and Mr. Guy Wint, India and Democracy (Macmillan, 1941, 12s. 6c?.), deserves special mention. It is an unusual piece of book-making in itself, for it consists of a study of recent developments by Mr. Wint coupled with a discussion of what ought to be done about them by Sir George Schuster. Not unnaturally in the circumstances, much of what Sir George wrote is already out of date. But Mr. Wint has done his work remarkably well. His proof-reading has not been impeccable ; he is guilty of the dreadful solecism of making men " sit dharma " ; and he forgets that the successes of Mr. Gandhi were achieved against a government that pursued a policy of non-violence as sedulously as Mr. Gandhi preached it. But his analysis of the Congress conduct of affairs, with its steady purpose of side-tracking the parliamentary machine and establishing a single-party rule, is strikingly borne out by the course of events since he wrote, on the one side by the flat refusal of Congress to accept any solution save that of absolute power for itself, and on the other by the equally flat refusals of the organised Muslims, Untouchables, and Trade-unionists to accept Congress dominion. Η. Η. Γλ It would be hard to find, amid the world's present anxieties, a book more pleasant and. soothing to read than the record of English social history contained in Mr. Walter Rose's Good Neighbours (Cam bridge University Press, 1942,10s. 6 d.). He has lived in the same village, not fifty miles from London, since 1871 ; and there his fathers lived before him. " The spirit of its life flowed in their veins, as it continues to flow in mine " (p. 1). Without sentimentality, but with deep affection ; with an attachment to old ways combined with an apprecia tion of the inevitability of charge ; with close observation and imagina tive sympathy with animals as well as human beings ; Mr. Rose describes the villagers' life and work, on the land, in their shops, in their crafts ; their ponies and pigs and hens; treasured village jokes and village characters. It cannot be solely a tale of happiness. For example, the " callous disregard of the landless labourer," in the Enclosures of 1839, had sad results. " Never before or since was so much food produced from the soil, and the producers so hungry " (p. 74). When by-and-by the allotment system came, the poor eagerly availed them selves of it, and developed a spirit not merely of co-operation but of conviviality. Yet this spirit vanished in its turn. " It remained unaffected by the making of a main-line railway near the village, but strangely enough it disappeared with the great war " (p. 77). It is characteristic of the author's sanity of outlook that his closing paragraph dwells, not upon " much that was beautiful in times now gone for ever," but upon the mastery gained over " terrors of past days," especially by medical science (p. 138). If anyone is unprepared to rejoice with him, let him perpend Mr. Rose's tale of the malster turned-dentist in thè 'forties of the last century. " One of father's joiners, when a boy, had a tooth drawn; he said that the maltster laid him on a stone flag floor and, kneeling on his chest, pinched the hollow double tooth until it split; he then pulled out the fragment singly " (p. 47).</page><page sequence="18">1943] SHORT NOTICES 125 John Horkham's drawings form a delightful accompaniment to the text. One wishes that as pendant to the swaying " daily march " of ducks (p. 69), he could have given us a glimpse of the strange sight of those hen mothers who had bred the ducks, seated in orange-boxes placed end to end in a shed devoted to this single purpose. " Silence reigned ; scores of hens in semi-darkness sat out their four weeks of parental durance " (p. 72). H. J. In his third series of essays Conflicts. Studies in Contemporary History. (Macmillan. 8s. (id.) Professor L. B. Namier writes with his usual assurance and precision; his aim is to analyse various aspects of contemporary politics from a historical angle, and analysis means to him a bold and unequivocal defence of his own conclusions rather than any cautious presentation of pros and cons for the reader's decision. Indeed, a certain lack of confidence in the reasoning powers of the average reader jnay be detected throughout this book. " It is a mistake to suppose that people think : they wobble with the brain, and sometimes the brain does not wobble " (p. 72). No reader, however average, of these challenging essays is likely to evade thought with the comfortable assumption that there is much to be said on both sides. The essays, which have been reprinted from various periodicals, have all, with one exception, been published since the beginning of the present war. The first nine consist of general studies of nineteenth and twentieth-century European history. He traces the progressive weakening of France's position in international affairs since 1815 : after 1919 her craving for security produced her system of alliances in East Cèntral Europe, but these attracted the hostility of three great powers, besides two small ones, and were a liability rather than an asset. He recognises, however, that France's difficulties after 1919 were by no means all of her own creation ; Hitler would have been a monstrous problem in any circumstances. With somnambulant but gangster-like skill he set out to master Europe, and this war " is his war, and nobody else's." Professor Namier belongs to that growing body of publicists who are discovered to have been " right about Hitler," and the great merit of these essays is that he finds so much that is interesting and new to say about tins hackneyed theme. He accepts the view that there are " two Germanies," but in the sense that behind the " wild Nazi façade " there is indeed" another Germany," " less crude, less hysterical, but even more dangerous." If the German eruption could have been contained for one generation, Hitler and the Nazis might themselves have most effectively achieved the task of breaking the other, truly dangerous, Germany. This, argument is developed in the essay on " Germany," and should be read with that on " The German International." A link between this group of essays, and a group of three on the Jews, is provided by an article reviewing two chapters in the Survey of International Affairs, 1938. The second of these reviews attacks Mr. Beeley's chapter on " The Administration of the British Mandate for Palestine, 1938-9." If there is an Arab side to the question, the reader will not find It in Professor Namier's pages. While convinced that it is idle to expect vast states like Bussia, the United States, and Brazil to</page><page sequence="19">126 HISTORY [MARCH " open their gates to a large Jewish immigration," he is equally certain that Palestine can and must absorb the millions who may want to go there after the war. The Zionist case is urged very powerfully : "all the ages bear witness that till our last breath we shall remember our God, our Land, and our People." It is clear, however, even from his own remarks, that intolerable persecution rather than Zionism is the compelling factor in the demand for unrestricted immigration rights into Palestine, and in these circumstances it seems both unnecessary and unwise to reject so completely the possibility of immigration into other countries. The whole Jewish case, in its psychological, political, and statistical aspects, is reviewed concisely in these three masterly essays. There are also studies of democracy, the party system, and wartime government, and finally some comments on English prose, which give excellent advice to the historian (pp. 218-20) on narrative and descrip tive writing. W. Ν. M. Dr. Eva Beatrice Dykes has chosen for The Negro in English Romantic Thought (The Associated Publishers, Inc., Washington, D.C. ; 1942 ; $2.00) a rather misleading title : the connotation of the word romantic is unduly extended ; and Dr. Dykes is concerned not with a particular strand in a general intellectual development, but with the sentiments expressed by individuals on a particular subject. But as a collection of the views expressed on the subject of slavery by major and minor English writers from about 1700 to about 1850 it is a valuable guide to the literary background of Abolition and Emancipation. We have also received the following books : G. Soule, The Strength of Nations (Macmillan, 1942; 12s.

Niemeyer, Law without Force (Princeton University Press, 1941 ; 22s. 6d.), which studies the problem of the kind of law most fitting for the social structure of the modern world, and suggests a functional instead of a moral basis for interna tional law ; F. C. Speranza (editor), The Diary of Cino Speranza, Italy, 1915-19 (New York, Columbia University Press, 1941 ; $10), a vivid picture of life in Italy during the last war seen through the eyes of an American citizen of Italian descent who was given a diplomatic appoint ment in Italy by the Government of the United States ; A Brief History of Our Own Times, by the late Professor Ramsay Muir (George Philip ; 8s. 6d.), a third edition of a survey of the European world since 1880, to which the author added just before his death an epilogue on the years 1933-9, where without concealing his own opinions he tried to set forth the facts of a period open to acute controversy in as objective a way as possible.
