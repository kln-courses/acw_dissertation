<plain_text><page sequence="1">Organic to Human-Psychological and Sociological. By HENRY MAUDS- LEY, M.D. London, Macmillan and Co., i9i6.-pp. viii, 386. "This book," according to the author, "was written to employ the writer in work which might occupy the time and ease the burden of the dreary decline from three to four score years" (p. vii). It is the retrospect of "disillusioned old age." This, too, is entitled to its say. "Having experimentally proved and therefore vitally felt the vanity</page><page sequence="2">No. 3.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 3I3 of vanities of mortal things (which full life repeats by rote but never really wishes or wills to feel), it may, as a spectator of and no longer actor in them, judge sometimes more justly than younger life eagerly interested in its active doings and deeply impressed by their and its importance" (p. vii). Each stage of life and each temperament has its own view of life's value. "The succeeding changes of feeling through life's changing seasons and shifting scenes respond exactly to the succeeding fluctuations of vital energy-to the earlier addition to and later subtraction from life and to every morbid perversion of its process. In youth, flushed with the vital force of growth, buoyant exhilaration, jubilant activity and cheerful outlook prevail, life and hope forefeeling and pressing on to the future; in maturity, when there is a balance of forces, gravity of thought and motion rule; in old age, when the destructive forces preponderate and a gradual decline takes effect, sluggish dejection of thought, feeling and movement ensues, for every day is then a gradual subtraction from life which, hope ex- tinct, lives only or mainly in the past" (p. 63). To ask which has the truer view of life, youth or old age, the life-flushed optimist or the gloomy pessimist, "is a futile question, either view being fit and true for the person who holds it" (p. 362). While the author cannot help feeling that the melancholy temperaments are the ones "in which reason rules and pushes to its logical extreme," he also recognizes that it is not by these "but by the optimistic temperaments in which the unreflecting impulse of feeling is joyous and active that the future progress of the race can be effected" (p. 363). Hence it is natural for the optimist to look down upon the pessimist. We must not be misled by the term progress, however, which is used more in irony than in earnest. The author spurns all teleology. Natural and unnatural are "only static human concepts of the dyna- mic flux of nature in which the 'What is' always imports the 'Whence' and the 'Whither.' Things morbid are just as natural as things not morbid, though life is loth to think so " (p. 34). All happens according to "the fixed law of the vital flux." Human thought is prone to as- sume the evolution of itself as the sufficient purpose and to interpret the universe in its own anthropomorphic terms, thus apotheosizing itself. "Man believes that he can do the universe no greater honor than to attribute his limited notion of purpose to its illimitable and unscrutable processes and having done so to glorify himself accord- ingly" (p. I53). But "it is more than probable that nature's work, purposive or not, is not to interpret itself in terms of human thought but to interpret human life in terms of itself" (p. 35). In relation to</page><page sequence="3">314 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. absolute, eternal, and infinite being "it is absurd to speak of pre- vision, purpose, time and space." Human life is but part of the wax- ing and waning cycles of vital impulse whichas it is born out of nature, so shall it find its grave in nature's womb. Paleontology offers numerous instances of species which have perished partly from internal changes, partly from environmental selection. The author seems to take grim satisfaction in that " supreme irony of nature" when man "should in the decree of unknown fate fall a victim to the microscopic microbe" which perhaps his " pleasant vices" have engendered to slay him (pp. i83, i84). In the meantime, while life moves on to its futile end, "the bright star of the right ideal-for ideals are far from being always right- will be necessary and useful to incite and guide human travel onwards'" (p. I48). But the author furnishes no criterion of right ideals. In- deed the uprush of vital impulse must always believe in itself. " When does superior strength of lusting life ever fail to inspire belief in its superior worth?" (p. I33). This is as true in national as in individual life. "The simple truth is that human history is a positive demon- stration of the lust and strength of the will to live, not motivated either rationally or morally--of the fundamental vital movement in human form; the glorification of a life of meekness, humility, love of enemies and the like self-abasements, an impracticable gospel of lowliness and weakness which, had it been put in practice, would have been the deterioration and probable extirpation of the person, tribe or nation which made the experiment" (pp. 35, 36). But if ideals are merely the reflex results and adumbrations of vital impulse, they still have their function for the time being. "It may be that beneath all this lauded civilization there is a lurking doubt of its value, perhaps a deep instinct of the final nothingness of human life. Be that as it may, the ever-craving, ever-seeking, ever-hoping vital struggle to attain ideal truth and happiness will evidently persist while organic energy lasts in vigor, even though it be only a splendid illusion; will continue, too, to evoke and promote the progressive adaptations of aspiring life to fuller being and therewith changing truths. But why then call the yearning an illusion? As a mentally evolved reality it does its useful work in human evolution until its force is spent " (pp. 95, 96). Idealism and realism are both merely phases of this process, idealism being the consciousness of the exuberance of vital impulse, while realism emphasizes the inertia which must be overcome. What is the place of mind in such a world? The author rejects, as one would expect, the notion that mind is an entity. Instead of mind</page><page sequence="4">No. 3.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 315 he prefers to say "life-in-mind." "To receive from without through sense and to react by fit movement is the structural basis of mental life; it is to grow in continuity and unity with nature by mutual union and interaction" (p. i i). "The progressive mental organization of man consequent to the number, variety and refinements of the actions and reactions between his organism and its environment-in the case of speech, for example, so wondrously fine, many and various, where out of twenty-four letters of the alphabet such a multitude of words in different languages are formed-marks the persistent energy of the vital plasm in him, its impulse inciting his aspiration and endeavor to apprehend and comprehend, which is to grasp and assimilate ever more and more of the ultimately inapprehensible and incomprehen- sible" (p. I2). The author's view would be characterized as physio. logical materialism. " The real truth, as the so-called materialist holds, is that it is exquisitely fine cerebral structure which performs the fine mental function, not the attribute consciousness, as those suppose who speak lightly and loosely of its directing and controlling mental states " (p. 76). Consciousness merely dances "attendance on the grotesquely incongruous yet sometimes congruous events of the unruly function without the least surprise, resentment, protest or control: a notable uprising of physiology into psychology by continuity of being" (p. 76). As regards the continuity of life-in-mind in the race the author adopts an extreme form of Lamarckism which seems to have found favor with some contemporary psychologists. He com- pares instinctive inheritance with the capitalization of mind in the realm of social invention and contrivance. "It is in like manner that the intelligent instincts of animals represent the silent memories of past habits of acquired function grafted in structure, and that the innate capacities and aptitudes of human intellect signify the quintes- sence of immemorial consolidate adaptations transmitted as uncon- scious mind by heredity" (p. 86). Hence it is no wonder that he finds in the organisms, such as the spider or bee, an unconscious wisdom which infinitely surpasses human reason. It would seem, however, that this capitalized wisdom is capable from the author's point of view of running amuck, as for example in the extreme socialism of the beehive which completely subordinates the individual to the hive; and the author has misgivings that there is a tendency in human history to the social hive (p. I94). Being an individualist of the staunch aristocratic school, nothing irritates him as much as socialism of which he has the conventional conception. As regards the function of thought, the author's position is frankly</page><page sequence="5">316 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. anti-intellectualistic both in the moral and epistemological realm. "The illogical has deeper and stronger root in human nature than the logical. Inevitably so, seeing that his organic being whence feeling springs is a continuation of the organic life of nature, the unfailing impulse or nisus of which, working in and through him, is something that reason neither originates nor authoritatively rules, but must accept, regulate, direct, and make its rational adaptations to" (pp. 64, 65). Thus it would seem that "reason, though it does not impel, has its proper function to guide, direct and regulate the vital motion of socialization" (p. II7). But such a function the author himself recognizes to be futile. " Desire-born faith avails to produce belief" (p. 64), and reason is ever "forced to suspense or suppression in face of feeling" (p. 200). What actual morality there is must be found in "the collective obligation of the traditions, customs and national spirit which the thereby moulded individuals may not or dare not violate in practice" (p. 357). Hunger and lust are the deep motive forces of life, in spite of all our "sublimations or spiritualizations," though social feelings have a certain justification in making possible group solidarity (p. I54). The author, however, is out of sympathy with so-called social reform which seems to him to be a pampering of the weak and an attempt to level distinctions. "Life in its essence is self-seeking and self-assertive in all its forms, high and low, mental and bodily" (p. 337). Democracy is merely an illusion. "Having become a creed, democracy absolutely ignores reason and glorifies itself when it is such in name only, not even a rule by the people who are duped and dupe themselves with the word" (p. 350). Eugenism looks more foolish to the author than nature's chance breeding, nature being no respecter of intellectual pedigrees. One would expect that "if the uncritical heart witnesses to a deeper truth than the critical intellect" (p. 54), the author would at least tolerate the religious mystic. But not so. "The supernatural transports which he relishes as a partial foretaste of eternal communion are liable to be, if not delirious self- intoxication, at least debauches of delight which do no good to any- body but himself, even if they do as much as that" (p. 339). He does, however, recognize a therapeutic value in faith and prayer (p. I77). The author, while evidently having the consciousness of "the truly inspired pioneer," offers no constructive social program, leaving that evidently for another voice, reflecting "that it is what is said, not he who says it, which matters, and that in the end it will not matter what is said" (p. 337). The end of the story is absolute relativism and agnosticism. "The</page><page sequence="6">No. 3.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 3I7 sum of the matter is that there is no human nature without outer nature, no outer nature as perceived without human nature, no outer nature to any creature, human or animal, otherwise than as it is mentally apprehended and formed by the percipient" (p. 371). It is absurd for man to imagine himself to be contemplating nature calmly from outside. His evaluations of it necessarily vary with his altered self and his knowledge is limited by his sense reactions and cerebral organization. He necessarily "plunges into a morass of futile specu- lations and assumptions when he goes on to construct a system of notions concerning what exists and happens beyond the range of thought . . . that which, being absolute, is avowedly non-relative in- comprehensible, ineffable" (p. 38I). But it is useless for the philosopher to wail over his ignorance of the unknowable. He must learn "that his modest function is to do the best for himself while he is a transient self in his little corner of it and for his kind in the particular social environment in which his lot is cast" (p. 384). I shall leave the reader to make his own criticisms. The author does not make any references to his contemporaries, and they probably were largely in the subconscious background of his mind. But the reader can see that the book capitalizes many tendencies of the age which the author lived through and in a measure outlived. In his grim frankness, he furnishes the reduction ad absurdum of a philosophy based on vital impulse. That in baring his mind, he has furnished material for the psychology of senescence cannot be denied. In spite of brilliant flashes of thought and expression, the structure of the book shows a noble mind in dissolution. But that his philosophy can be regarded as typical of senescence, as he seems to feel, is more than open to doubt. Certainly in many cases the will-to-believe grows stronger rather than weaker with age. The author's type of disillu- sionment must be regarded as the outcome of the subconscious tenden- cies which capitalized his thinking and feeling for a lifetime and which were released in the leisure of his waiting years of inactivity. In the meantime the distinguished alienist has been released from waiting and has passed into the great unknown. What perspective may be his now we do not know, but we are grateful for a life of brilliant achievement. J. E. BOODIN. CARLETON COLLEGE.</page></plain_text>
