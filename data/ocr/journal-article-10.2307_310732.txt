<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRIT OF COMEDY IN PLATO BY WILLIAM CHASE GREENE I PHILOSOPHY is at best a solemn business, concerned with weighty matters, and inclined to fall into a technical jargon in which the words sometimes conceal, rather than reveal, the thought. Even when the world was young, the philosopher had the reputation of be- ing an unpractical star-gazer who had little in common with his fellow- men. Search the indices of Plato, and you will find no imputation of wit, humor, or satire. The uninitiated will suppose that Plato was as solemn as the rest of the tribe. Yet several clues might save us at the start from so capital an error. We may recall the fondness of Plato's master for a quizzical sort of irony, that mystified, irritated, and at times enlightened his associates; it would be surprising if Plato had not learned something of this method. What is more, we know that Plato was supposed to have been fond of the mimes of Sophron; add to this the significant fact that Aristotle, in discussing literary types, is at a loss for a common term to include the " Socratic discourses " and the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus, but feels that they should be included in a single class.' To be sure, Aristotle argues merely that both forms are examples of imitation in prose; and since the mime might be either arovaos or yEXotos, it would not be fair to conclude from Aristotle's words that he regarded the dialogues of Plato as necessarily comic in vein. On the other hand, the mime was habitually comic, and though realistic in treatment, tended to intro- duce in a lifelike way idealized types, ordinarily comic, already familiar in the theatre and the public assemblies. Therefore whatever weight is to be given to Aristotle's remark must go to suggest that he thought the dialogues of Plato dealt with ideal types in a realistic manner, probably with a touch of comedy; certainly we should not conclude 1 Arist. Poet. I447b; cf. Frag. 61, Berlin ed., 1486a. 63</page><page sequence="2">64 William Chase Greene that he thought their purpose was to chronicle historical facts or episodes.' Even before opening the pages of Plato himself, then, we have the right to expect to find in them something of the comic spirit. Furthermore the expectation has the sanction of Plato, who professes to have no high regard for the written word; it is perforce inferior to the living word of conversation. But the philosopher, he thinks, may at times write in a playful mood.2 Just how far this spirit of play is the key to Plato's meaning is the matter to be investigated in this study. One need turn over no great number of pages in the dialogues to find passages interlarded with amusing phrases, homely proverbs, and racy metaphors, which give a lively conviction that we are listening to the talk of men of flesh and blood, not sticks and stones. There is the description by Socrates of himself as a gadfly 3 and the recurrent simile of the midwife.4 We learn to expect the half-earnest, half- impatient exclamation that is always on his lips, 'By the dog of Egypt.' Philosophical argument falls easily into such a mould: the soul, we read, is imprisoned in the body 'like an oyster in its shell'; 5 according to the followers of Heracleitus, the world is 'like a leaky vessel or a man who has a running at the nose.' 6 Meno, when asked for a definition of virtue, responds with a 'swarm of virtues,'7 or 'makes many out of one, as is often said in jest of those who pound or beat anything to pieces.'8 Courage is a thing not 'such as every pig would know'; and this laughing remark leads to the real point (and is not said merely iralSwv)), that there is such a quality as' thought- ful courage.' 9 There is no need of multiplying instances, scattered through even some of the later dialogues, of humorous language. The characters in the dialogues, too, are drawn with the comic writer's care for realistic detail and the exaggeration of significant traits. A gallery of minor characters are hit off, each with an adjective or a phrase. The 'eager' Chaerephon10 is 'a kind of madman';11 Menex- enus is always 'very pugnacious,'12 not unlike the 'pertinacious' 1 As A. E.

The pompous Ion, most gullible when most deceived, is a picture by himself; but we find his peer in the fatuous Euthyphro, the exemplar of misunderstood greatness. Thrasymachus is painted in broad strokes; nothing characterizes him so well as the words with which he hurls himself 'like a wild beast' into the conversation: 'What folly, Socrates, has taken possession of you all ?' and the manner in which he tries to withdraw, 'having, like a bath-man, deluged our ears with his words.' 6 More subtle is the way in which, progressively, a similar attitude is upheld by characters in the Gorgias; the famous rhetorician is courteous, self-satisfied, rather simple, and has nothing to say when confuted; Polus is the vehement, cock-sure young man; Callias is more frank, and becomes surly when the argu- ment goes against him. The crowning audacity in characterization comes when immediately after the most profound moment of the Symposium Plato puts in the mouth of Alcibiades, the drunken rev- eller, the humorous but wholly revealing remarks about the nature of Socrates, whom it will be sufficient here to remember as that satyr, or Silenus, or Marsyas, who is half a wild thing of nature and half divine.' This double creature we shall encounter more than once. The comedy of incident is everywhere abundant, especially in the opening scenes of the dialogues. Such an episode as the beginning of the Charmides, where the audience struggle for seats,8 is not over- drawn; I have seen it reenacted in Paris, with abandon, at a lecture by Bergson. Who but Plato, however, would have introduced the argument of the dialogue as a cure for a head-ache, or have sent Aristophanes off into a fit of hiccoughs, in the Symposium, so as to 1 Phaedo 62ef; 77a. 2 Symposium 173d. s Ibid., 173b. * Lysis 204b ft. 5 Rep. 336b. 6 Ibid., 344d. 7 Symposium 215 ff. 8 Charmides 155c.</page><page sequence="4">66 William Chase Greene postpone his farcical myth to its effective place in the dialogue ? I It is of a piece with the absent-mindedness of Socrates that had kept him from appearing at the house of his host till supper was half over. Both incidents are in character; both mildly ridicule their heroes; neither was strictly necessary to the plot. Such, too, is the banter and by-play that mark the beginning of the Phaedrus, and the riotous close of the Lysis, where the tutors of Menexenus and Lysis interrupt and pack them home, shouting angrily in their barbarous dialect, somewhat drunk.2 And nothing, surely, could be better than the delicacy of the spirited narrative at the beginning of the Protagoras: the spirit of early morning adventure; the surly porter, annoyed at the swarm of sophists; the great Protagoras promenading, attended by his admirers, who follow him, wheeling with military precision as he turns at the end of his course; the mock liturgical quotations of Homer introducing Hippias and Prodicus, the latter in bed, much bundled up, and talking to so large an audience that Socrates can come near enough only to hear the indistinct booming of his barytone voice.3 To multiply examples of comic phraseology, amusing characters and ludicrous episodes to be found in the dialogues would be easy; but even an exhaustive collection, if it were worth making, would prove nothing more than that Plato was either a clever reporter or, what is more likely, a shrewd artist who reported or invented what he most needed to give a sense of reality to his philosophical mimes. It requires perhaps a greater degree of boldness to see in these comic gestures presumptive evidence that the spirit of comedy may lie deeper than the surface. We are at least bound to inquire how far the presumption is fortified by facts. On almost every page of Plato is inscribed a ridicule, sometimes courteous, sometimes veiled, often outspoken, of Plato's adversaries. I Cf. Jowett, tr. Plato, I, p. 530. The use of this device to call attention to the position of the speech is similar to the method used in the Republic to emphasize the importance of solid geometry and to call attention to its comparative neglect (Rep. 528ab). Socrates pretends to skip the subject, and then recurs to it with apologies. Solid geometry was in the time of Socrates embryonic, but not non- existent; the question, therefore, is one of emphasis, not of a clumsily evaded anachronism. 2 Lysis 233ab. 3 Protagoras 3II-316.</page><page sequence="5">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 67 At first the objects of his shafts are real persons, the contemporaries of his master Socrates, whose prestige he defends against all comers. Even in the early dialogues, however, there are cases where Socrates does not quite come off a manifest victor in the battle of wit, and that, too, not for the reason that the dialogue is merely sceptical or apore- tic; a conclusion is suggested, directly or indirectly, which clearly belongs to the writer of the dialogue. By degrees the hero of the dia- logues appears no longer as Socrates, but as an impersonal spirit of philosophy speaking through various mouths, and in one notable instance speaking directly against the character named Socrates.' The objects of ridicule are now no longer historical personages, or at least are attacked less as individuals than as types of the forces that were opposed by the idealized Socrates, or by the spirit of true philos- ophy. The antithesis being clear in Plato's mind, - Socrates contra mundum, or the true philosopher ranged against the sham pretender, - the course of comedy is plain; for comedy means, as Plato tells us, the exposure of all pretensions.2 Even a partial list of the persons and the schools of training held up to ridicule by Plato is impressive; for it includes the greater part of the orthodox teachers and masters of Greece. Beginning with Homer, whom he quotes sometimes seriously, but more often with a twinkle in his eye, there are not many of the great poets whom he does not pillory; and the whole art of poetry, after being subjected to a searching criticism, is given only a qualified approval.3 If the poet is an irresponsible being, it follows that the rhapsode, for all his fine clothes and his beautiful poses, is even more absurd; 4 and Euhemeriz- ing interpreters of mythology and arbitrary etymologists are as bad.5 Those who are forever explaining matters by appeals to a deus ex machina or to the f&amp;pa'apoL or to antiquity are dismissed with con- tempt." The sophists are for Plato the supreme deceivers; and though 1 Cf. pp. 76 f. 2 Philebus 48-50. a That Plato did not condemn poetry outright, but based his criticism of it, for better as well as for worse, strictly on the principles of his philosophy, is the con- clusion maintained in my study, Plato's View of Poetry (H. S. C. P., XXIX, 1918), which in several respects supplements the present study. * Ion, passim. 6 Phaedrus, 229b ff.; Cratylus, passim. 6 Cratylus, 425d-426b.</page><page sequence="6">68 William Chase Greene most of Grote's defence of them may be sustained from the point of view of the practical needs of Greece, Plato treats them with no exag- gerated harshness when he contrasts their superficiality and their chance methods with the rigid requirements of his own creed.1 For individual sophists there may be a good-natured tolerance or a mild satire: here we deal with the actual contemporaries of Socrates, who addresses them generally with mock respect. He is unfortunately prevented by poverty from attending the more expensive course of Prodicus on philology; 2 as a matter of fact, however fanciful Prodicus is, he shows more good sense than the other sophists.' The irony is more patent when Socrates professes his desire to become the pupil of the 'pancratiasts' Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,4 or compli- ments the sophists on their knowledge and their business ability.5 Plato goes out of his way to be fair to Protagoras, giving him some of the best arguments in the dialogue that bears his name,6 and restating his doctrines or the conclusions that should be drawn from them; I but the prevailing tone, when Protagoras is on the stage, is one of deeply ironical appreciation. So, for example, Socrates, when about to prick the bubble of his argument, is most appreciative of his speech, and has 'only one very small difficulty which he is sure Protagoras will easily explain, as he has already explained so much.' 8 As Plato gradually drops the fiction of the reporter, and speaks in propria persona, the courtesy that has been extended to the individual sophist is dropped, and the sophist, as a type, becomes the victim of a merciless attack. During Plato's maturity and old age, to be sure, sophists in the strict sense no longer existed; but their attitude of mind persisted in various forms, and was so obviously the arch-enemy of true philoso- phy that we find Plato devoting a dialogue to the analysis and repro- bation of the sophist, even naming it for the villain of the piece. Rhetoric is for Socrates, as for Plato, another false idol. Socrates treats Gorgias with signs of respect; 9 but is capable of giving in the style of Gorgias an answer that is 'theatrical and pompous' but not I The responsibility is not really shifted to the public in Rep. 492; for it is the sophists who feed the ' Great Beast.' 2 Cratylus, 384b; cf. 39ib. 3 Phaedrus, 267b. * Euthydemus, 272b. 6 Apology, 19, 20. 6 Cf. pp. 76 f. 7 Theaetetus, 162 ff. 8 Protagoras, 328e. 9 Meno 7obc.</page><page sequence="7">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 69 good;' Lysias comes in for a good deal of satire, whether the speech attributed to him in the Phaedrus is genuine or a parody, and is ad- vised to study philosophy rather than rhetoric ;2 and the whole aim and method of the art of rhetoric, as generally practised, is set down as deception.3 There, again, the increasing intensity of the onslaught keeps pace with the transition from the individual to the type. A similar progress may be traced in the treatment of the politicians, from ironical appreciation of the individual 4 to condemnation of the type; 5 the politician is only a sort of rhetorician.6 One contemporary of Plato is singled out for an especially pointed rebuke; Isocrates might have become a real educator, had he forsaken rhetoric for philosophy.7 Of philosophers, few, even of the teachers of Socrates and Plato, escape comic criticism. Heracleitus and his followers, 'father' Par. menides, even the Pythagoreans have to take their turn.8 Socrates is not infallible, even as a sceptic; and it is possible to detect glancing refutations of Plato's own contemporaries, - Antisthenes, heretical hedonists, and ardent but misguided 'friends of the ideas.' 9 It is not enough, however, to regard Plato as a merely satirical writer following with an increasingly embittered mood the destruc- tive critical method of his master. Socrates himself, to be sure, might insist that he was no torpedo-fish, unless that animal be conceived as itself experiencing the numbness that it induces in others.'i But Plato does not betray an equal candor; he knows how to use stalking- horses. The essence of the dialogues is a spirit, apparently disin- terested, but in fact carefully directed by the author, which we might call " the argument personified" as the real hero of the dialogues; and " Socrates " in the dialogues often refers to it in al- most these terms. He knows that he is a cat's paw. His wisdom in I Meno, 76e. 2 Phaedrus, 278bc; 279b. 3 Phaedrus, passim. 4 Cf. Euthyphro, 2b ff.

Again, poor Euthyphro cries: 'I really do not know how to tell you what I think. Whatever we set up seems somehow to move away; it refuses to stay where we put it.' ' Why,' retorts Socrates, ' that sounds as though your theories were the work of my master Daedalus.' 'Their shifting and changing is none of my doing,' replies Euthy- phro; 'it is yours; you are our Daedalus.' That is our cue; but Socrates is not his own master any more than is Euthyphro; he, too, goes through his paces, and that, too, unwillingly. He makes his own works and those of others move against his will; he would rather fix his argument on a firm base. Still he is not so much a Daedalus as Euthyphro, who makes the argument move in a circle.2 Of course the arch-manipulator here is the Socrates-Plato who is playing with the consequences of one-sided definitions. So, again, in the Crito the personified laws address Socrates, giving us a dialogue within the dialogue, that includes a comic picture of the imagined escape of Socrates from prison;3 they are the antithesis of the threatening argu- ments, like hobgoblins or bogies, that are used to frighten children.4 It is indeed 5iKaLos X 6yos confronting a~LKOS X6'OS. Or we may turn to the Charmides, the argument of which "says 'no"' and mocks us; 6 or to the Protagoras, where we learn that ' if the argument had a human voice, it would be heard laughing at us,' and pointing at the paradoxical relation of the speakers.6 Laches finds that the quality he is trying to define 'slips away from him, and he can not get hold of her'; Socrates is of the opinion that the good sportsman should follow the track, and not be lazy.' The metaphor is repeated, with variants, in several other dialogues, notably in the Phaedo, where the argument is conceived as game to be hunted.8 The Phaedo, more- over, contains a notable plea for disinterestedness and courage in argument, a plea that is doubly emphatic by reason of its position: both the hearers of Socrates and Echecrates, the hearer of the re- peated discussion, express their bewilderment at the argument, and are counselled against distrusting the reason and against betraying 1 Apology, 39c ff. 2 Euthyphro, II; I5. 3 Crito, 50 ff. 4 Crito, 46c.

In the Phaedrus, Lady Rhetoric, having spoken in self-defense, is answered by the arguments of So- crates, which he addresses as his ' noble children.' 2 Socrates in the Republic professes to have no preconceived doctrine; 'Whither the argument blows, we follow.' " This may be quoted as evidence of the open-minded attitude of the historical Socrates; but we shall not be far wrong if we see in it also the acquiescence of the mouth-piece of that Plato who knows well enough where the wind of argument is to take his characters. He (or Theodorus, speaking for him) is not afraid of any judge or spectator who may recall him to the point 4; for he is himself the judge in the rules of the game. It seems as if we might almost add a minor supplementary canon to that used by Bonitz and Adam for the determination of Plato's real teaching (that the unre- futed residue, after propositions have been discussed, holds): it ap- pears that Plato is fond of setting off or projecting his views by making them as impersonal as possible; it is something told to Socrates, or dreamed, or argued to him by the spirit of logic, that he firmly holds; the characters in his writings are merely carried by the current. It is at any rate worth while to test this fiction of the comic spirit in the several dialogues. II The Apology, though dealing with a very serious situation, strikes constantly the note of comedy.5 Confronted by vaguely worded I Phaedo, 88c-91a. 2 Phaedrus, 260d-26ia. 3 Rep. 394d. 4 Theaetetus, I73c. 5 For convenience, I discuss the dialogues in the order adopted by Lutoslawski (The Origin and Growth of Plato's Logic), placing the Lysis and the Ion, which he omits, in the early group of 'Socratic ' dialogues. One can not avoid the question of the 'historicity' of the various dialogues. I have already (in Plato's View of Poetry, pp. 4-6) indicated my belief that it never occurred to Plato to present an historical picture of Socrates, and that he always felt at liberty to treat Socrates, like the other historical personages, with great freedom. One may admit degrees in his use of this freedom; in this case it seems clear to me that the Apology is the dialogue in which we should expect the most scrupulous adherence to fact and to the ipsissima verba of Socrates, though even here it is not to be expected that we have anything like what a modern newspaper man would call a strictly accurate re- port. The whole conception of literary standards and ethics in Plato's time favored a greater degree of freedom than seems natural or even justifiable today. Indeed,</page><page sequence="10">72 William Chase Greene charges that he could perhaps disprove, did he care to do so, Socrates sees that his real antagonist is a mere prejudice, which time has created and which only time could remove. He does not seriously deal with the charges, but throws up a mocking defense;1 and then, turning his back on his judges, he talks to the few who can understand him and to posterity. The Apology is a comic justification of the life lived in the spirit of comedy, - the exposure of pretension, - at the behest of a god: surely this is piety! The unpopularity of Socrates arises from the fact that the public has no sense of humor, and from the irresponsible use of the spirit of comedy by the young bloods of Athens,2 at which the public is angry, and therefore invents false charges. 'The truth, I imagine, they would not care to say, namely, that they have been convicted of claiming knowledge when they know nothing.' 3 The falseness of the charges is easily shown; Meletus is rapidly lured into making wild and unconsidered accusations, admissions, and con- tradictions, in which emphasis takes the place of discretion, and which show how little care he has given to the case.4 Socrates gives Meletus a lesson in logic,5 and dismisses him as insignificant; it is the old prejul dice, if anything, that will overwhelm him. So he turns to his rea- defense, the interpretation of his past life." The life of inquiry, the life of philosophy, is his divine mission, which must not be betrayed.7 It is not his fault, then, if the latter part of his defense seems almost wilfully to rub the jury the wrong way; and in fixing his counter- penalty Socrates is not insolent, but merely carrying out consistently Schanz has denied all historical value to the Apology, and C. W. E. Miller argues that the question of Chaerephon and the reply of the Delphic oracle is a fiction and the literary device of Plato (Johns Hopkins University Circular, IgIo; No. 6, pp. 13- 16). But it is fair to ask whether a speech purporting to give a defence made at a formal trial, at which the public, including Plato, was present, is not from the nature of the case more likely to exclude intentional fiction than, for example, an account of an informal conversation with friends like that recorded in the Phaedo, at which the author expressly says he was not present. The question will recur in an acute form in the discussion of the Phaedo: cf. pp. 90go ff. I Pater (Plato and Platonism, p. 79) finds sophistry or casuistry in the Apology; of course it is there, and that is part of the comedy! Read as sober logic, the argu- ment in this part of the dialogue loses its point. 2 Apology, 23c. 3 Ibid., 23d. 4 Apology, 24-26. I Ibid., 27b ff. 6 Cf.

As a matter of fact, no other penalty or even compromise would be consistent; Socrates is not bargaining, but conducting his defense on a wholly different level from that of the law-court; he rests it on that of pure reason. He sees it is not easy to remove a great prejudice in a little time; and he does not try to do so.2 He rather dramatizes in comedy the contrast between this earthly miscarriage of justice and the ideal justice of the other world, where departed worthies win their deserts and can enjoy the life of philosophic inquiry.3 And he closes his speech with an appeal to the just judges to reprove and trouble his sons if they care for money or anything else more than for righteousness, or' seem to be something when they are really nothing;' 4 this will mean that real justice will have been received.' So Socrates, heaping coals of fire on the heads of his accusers, steps from the bema: not he, but the philosopher is the hero of the dialogue; not the verdict in his case, but the real justice that he invokes, is the motive of his discourse. He has only followed the life of philosophy enjoined on him by a god (that is his technical defense, so far as there is one, against the charge of impiety); he will not show fear in the face of death, or abandon the life of the philoso- pher, or use unworthy means to work on the feelings of the jury; that would be inconsistent with the life of philosophy.6 He prefers to let ' truth pass the sentence of unrighteousness and injustice ' on his ac- cusers.7 Truth, or real justice, is the invisible victor: some think Socrates wise when he refutes other men; ' the truth probably is that God is wise, and by the oracle means only that human wisdom is of little or no account.' 8 Socrates changes from the r6le of hero to that of an agent of reason. To the posterity for whom the speech is mainly intended, the change is not a fall; to the comic spirit, it appears a posi- tive gain. Much the same point is made in the Euthyphro, but the comic con- trast between orthodoxy and the philosophic temper is more broadly I Apology, 36-37. 2 Apology, 37b. 3 Ibid., 40-41. It is in this spirit, as we shall see, that the ideal of philosophy and the disappointing practise of poetry are placed in comic conflict in the last book of the Republic. 4 Apology, 4Ie. 5 Ibid., 42a. 6 Ibid., 34-35- ?

Euthyphro is orthodoxy personified; his piety is so impossibly consis- tent that he is proceeding to prosecute his father for the death of a murderous slave, for which his father is indirectly responsible. But Euthyphro's notions, when put to the test of simple Socratic logic, prove to be a tissue of contradictions and confusions. In the background stands the tragic fact that Socrates is soon to go to his death for preferring reason to orthodoxy. The satire is the more terrible for the enthusiasm that marks the pretended acquies- cence of Socrates in the positions of Euthyphro. 'Quite admirable, Euthyphro,' he cries, just before demolishing a definition; 1 and he is sure that if he could only become Euthyphro's pupil in the art of holiness he could meet the charges of his accusers. To be sure he could, - by forswearing his gift of reason; and Euthyphro could of course prove his point, - but has not the time. So Euthyphro de- parts, sublimely wise in his own conceit, and thoroughly approved by society; Socrates has shown only a negative sort of wisdom. But the comic contrast has left us tragically wiser. The same ironic manner lends character to the Ion. Burning with the desire to define the nature of knowledge and its sources, Socrates turns to the rhapsode Ion, who, as the recognized interpreter of Homer, poses as one of the official educators of Greece. Ion affirms and retracts; he 'has as many forms as Proteus,'2 while Socrates is not wise, like Ion, but is 'only a common man who speaks the truth.'3 Plato is neither seriously upholding the traditional view of poetic in- spiration nor wholly discarding it. Ion is used as a foil to throw the problem into relief; and enough is done when it is shown that he simply has no conception of the meaning of knowledge. That Ion is completely ignorant, in the face of Socratic analysis, goes without saying; that he is allowed to take refuge at last in the claim to inspira- tion, is to be expected. The result, for all the irony, is not wholly negative; whatever value is to be allowed to poetry and inspiration must depend on the friendly mediation of the reason.4 1 Euthyphro, 7a. 2 Ion, 541e.

The dialogue has been analyzed by L. Dyer, fol- lowing the suggestion of Cron, in the manner of the plot of a Greek tragedy.' The formal structure bears out the analysis to a striking degree; but I cannot help feeling that the current of the thought sug- gests even more the spirit of a comedy, or at least of those Euripidean tragedies that end happily. Certainly, 7rIXOKi and XoaLs lead to a con- clusion that is of fair omen, at least from the point of view of eternity. If it is a human tragedy, it is a divine comedy; and that is the point on which Socrates insists in the Apology, the Crito, the Gorgias, the Re- public, and other dialogues. If it is better to suffer than to do wrong, in the eyes of the gods the conclusion of the Crito must be nothing if not happy; and in fact, as Dyer points out, Socrates appeals to 6 OE's in his last sentence, as he does in the last sentences of the two main parts of the Apology, quite in the manner of Dante's closing references to le stelle. But this Commedia ends with a hint, not of a Paradiso, but of an Inferno and all the suggestions of the popular belief.2 As we have learned to expect, however, the transition is accomplished from the interest in the fortunes of a personal hero to the emergence of an abstract but personified principle; and the conclusion of the dialogue is fairly stated by the argument of the personified laws, who bid Socrates think of justice first, of life and family afterwards. The clue to the meaning of the next three dialogues is simple: with a great show of perplexity, "Socrates" is testing imperfect, because one-sided, definitions of various moral qualities. More than ever we feel that behind the feigned inconclusiveness a true standard of knowledge and conduct is being formulated. So, in the Charmides, the creation of definitions, only to be discarded, proves as infectious as a yawn;3 yet we have a dream of such a thing as universal knowl- edge, "a dream, whether from the horn or the ivory gate; "4 and young Charmides, with rare good sense, refuses to be taken in by the apparent failure of the arguments of Socrates.5 So Socrates, in the Laches, plays the ring-master; Laches and Nicias together give the truth, and say what Socrates does not explicitly lay down; and 1 L.

So the dialogue professes to end in ignorance; courage is an unknown quantity, and we must all go to school.' But the conclusion is not really so inconclusive; the shrewd man in the audience sees that several points have been established, - the need of universal definitions, and the place of the reason and of character in courage. In the Lysis, again, the bewilderment of the cross-examined Lysis, plied with leading questions and fallacious logic, gives scope for rich fun; even the head of Socrates is dizzy with the argument.2 But the line between the real impasse and the literary device is not sharply drawn. Instead of being given a didactic refuta- tion of false notions of the duties of friends, Lysis is trifled with, to the discomfiture of Hippothales. A series of verbal plays appears to prove that friends can not discover what is a friend, 'as the by-standers would say, as they went away.' 3 We, as the ' by-standers,' the audi- ence of the mime, see that it is irony of the dramatic type. We play the r61e of common-sense, and perceive with the author, what the actors do not know, the relation of friendship to human needs and to ideals. To a literal-minded reader, the Protagoras must seem a baffling dia- logue, with its shifting points of view, and the mixture of respect and ridicule meted out to the great sophist; read as what it is, high comedy from first to last, the dialogue is simple. The problem on which the conflict turns is that which came to the fore in the set of dialogues just discussed: Is virtue one, and can it be taught ? But the solution of the problem is not stated by any one speaker, nor, in fact, is it at all stated in so many words. But it lies near the surface. The character of Protagoras is drawn in no unfriendly spirit; 4 he is, moreover, no man of straw. He holds all the respectable doctrines, and is the mouth- piece of common-sense. So far as positive beliefs are concerned, there 1 Laches, 200, 201: a little psychological analysis of the point is all that is really needed. Cf. Aristotle on KaprEpia. 2 Lysis, 216c. 3 Ibid., 223. * There is, to be sure, incidental satire on sophistic and over-ingenious interpre- tation of poetry, and on the prolixity of the sophists: Protagoras ' goes forth on the gale with every sail set, out of sight of land into an ocean of words ' (Protagoras, 338a).</page><page sequence="15">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 77 would be little to criticize in him; but when it comes to a rational foundation for his beliefs, he is nowhere. Socrates simply floors him by superior dialectic; what Protagoras holds and Socrates denies, - that virtue can be taught, - is shown to be not common-sense, but the consequence of the doctrine that Protagoras has denied,--that virtue is knowledge and is one. The tables are completely turned. Now it is perfectly plain, in spite of the irony and satire, what the author of the dialogue really holds. He speaks equally through the mouth of Socrates and of Protagoras. He does not repudiate the fundamental moral notions of the sophist; and he approves for practi- cal purposes a sort of utilitarianism, that does not rest on trans- cendental grounds. But he insists on that systematic co6rdination and unification of moral qualities which the criticism of Socrates was able to supply. In other words, Protagoras supplies the content, Socrates the method. But the actual argument of the dialogue contains not a little of fallacious eristic, such as Plato can hardly have intended seriously; the antinomies, indeed, are so closely paralleled by the btoot XMyot, probably written before Plato's earliest writings, that Taylor supposes a common source.' It is clear that the substance of the Protagoras was a matter of frequent discussion in the days of Socrates; but it does not follow that Plato suggests that either of the opposing theses may be held with equal correctness. On the contrary, the arguments given to Socrates, though in detail sometimes fallacious, establish a clear advance over the initial position of Protagoras. The two wrestlers have not merely changed places; Protagoras has the satisfaction of seeing his belief accepted by Socrates, but not on his own terms, while Socrates finds that his reasoning supports what he recently denied. Either competitor in the contest would from his own point of view call it a draw; but the argument with its human voice may well 'laugh;' 2 for "the argument" is the hero of the dialogue, and from the content of Protagoras and the method of Socrates it is already launched on the construction of the revised ethics that we shall find in the later dialogues. Such a revision, of course, can not be attempted at the end of this dialogue; and the polite refusal of Pro- tagoras to co6perate with Socrates in a new discussion of the subject 1 A. E. Taylor, Varia Socratica, pp. 14 ft. 2 Protagoras, 361a.</page><page sequence="16">78 William Chase Greene till 'some future time ' is the obvious device of the author to indicate this limitation. When Socrates does return to the problem, in the Meno, it is not in company with Protagoras, though he makes half-serious compli- ments to Gorgias and Prodicus. Socrates is the solitary protagonist, professing ignorance of the essence of virtue; he is not wise, like Gorgias and his pupils. Meno, called upon to supply the missing knowledge, fails. Can virtue really be taught ? This is all part of the current disputation common to the Protagoras and the b&amp;rot X6yot; we even find the common fallacy, that one cannot seek either for that which one knows or for that which one does not know.2 And Socrates, who has just been accused of numbing his interlocutor like the torpedo- fish, and who has replied that his ignorance is no affectation, gives his answer to the fallacy in the doctrine of davLYugTs. That merely establishes the possibility of knowledge in general. It turns out that virtue does not seem to fall under the category of knowledge, or it would have been taught by sophists or by good men, - but this has not been done.3 It really appears that virtue can not be taught. Here comes a caution against superficial reasoning: ' We have been so fool- ish as not to consider that it is not under the conduct of science that the affairs of men are administered rightly or well' ;4 for practical af- Protagoras, 361e. 2 Meno, 8od. S The appeal to Anytus for an opinion on this matter is an admirable episode. Anytus, the model citizen, is shocked at the idea that the sophists are educators, and would not think of talking with them; Socrates thinks Anytus must have the gift of divination, if he knows what they are without any experience of them (Meno, 91, 92). Here we trifle on the edge of a volcano. This is the literal-minded person who is one day to accuse Socrates of impiety; and Socrates is defending the sophists before him! Anytus takes him in sober earnest: no wonder Aristophanes found it worth his while wilfully to confuse Socrates with other types of learned men, if he could reckon on such an audience. But there is worse to come. Socrates apologizes; he has said nothing to the purpose; Anytus gravely agrees, not seeing through the irony of Socrates, and goes on to say that any random Athenian is a better teacher of virtue than the sophists, earnestly suggesting that virtue comes from the example of great men. He is angry when examples rise up to confront him, and warns Socrates against speaking ill of others; as if he were among the illustrious men whom he erroneously supposes Socrates to abuse (Ibid., 92-95). He retires in a bad temper; it is doubtful whether Meno, who is asked at the end of the discussion to go and soothe him, will succeed in his mission. 4 Ibid., 96e.</page><page sequence="17">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 79 fairs, right opinion, though certainly different from knowledge, is enough, and this is a sort of inspiration.' Mystical utilitarianism, then, is the strange outcome of our search! The gesture reminds one of the ironical close of the lon, in which the rhapsode is given the privilege of claiming inspiration in default of knowledge. We are saved from complete bewilderment by the prompt putting of the "previous question"; what is the essence of virtue? That is a ques- tion, not for right opinion, but for knowledge: and the whole prob- lem must eventually be solved on the basis of the really knowable. Here is a dilemma indeed: the inconsistency and irresponsibility of the popular teachers force Socrates to stake conduct on reasoned knowledge of the essence of things. Reason, however, is just what has so far failed. Can it be trusted, or is intuition the supreme guide in conduct, as in other grave matters ? That is the question put for- ward in the Euthydemus. The comedy in the dialogue can not be missed by any reader: it is "of all the dialogues of Plato that in which he approaches most nearly to the comic poet; "2 and the irony is sus- tained to the very end. The casual reader is in much greater danger of failing to perceive the exquisite art with which the comedy strikes home a point of tremendous seriousness. The dialogue, in a word, should be read as a biting satire on verbal eristic and logical quibbles; it launches us again into the atmosphere of the %rolt X6-yot; 3 but the fallacies which Aristotle will duly expose by logical analysis, Plato holds up to ridicule by merely slightly caricaturing them, and invit- ing our approval. In the art of eristic, the elderly brothers Euthyde- mus and Dionysodorus are enfants terribles; what fun to be like them! They can argue both sides of anything; so Socrates, when the bark of his argument is on the point of ship-wreck, calls on them, his Dioscuri, to save him from the billow,4 and wishes to become their pupils." No modern reader could conceivably be taken in for a moment by the irony; but the fallacies that the brothers so glibly toss off were real stumbling-blocks to the young men of Plato's time as well as to those of the earlier generation.6 To the contemporaries of both 1 Ibid., 99bc. 2 Jowett, tr.

For their credulity the best antidote was satire. So in the Euthydemus Plato flings about all sorts of fallacies of a type that are obvious to us and of a type that in less grimly logical moods Plato's Socrates him- self has admitted.' Again, as so many times before, the reader sees the point and is not deceived by the assumed bewilderment of So- crates and his eulogy of the sophists. And what is the outcome ? Jowett, who realizes that the work belongs to the "early" group of dialogues, holds that it represents Socrates as willing to learn, but unable to teach; it has not yet reached, he thinks, the position of the Meno, - that there are no teachers.2 The bearing of the Euthydemus, however, becomes decidedly different when we regard it, with Luto- slawski, as following the Meno, and realize that the Meno itself is by no means wholly sceptical. The sequence of thought therefore is: Right conduct should depend on reason; conduct has not yet been based on reason, for the teachers have not been fully rational (so far the Meno); the cause of their failure is the embryonic condition of logic; therefore right conduct will depend on the development of a true logic. That this last proposition is the real conclusion of the Euthydemus, rather than any confession of helplessness, is quite ap- parent. Though young students of philosophy, 'like children after larks, always think they are on the point of catching the art, which has always just escaped them,'3 the Socrates of the dialogue is suffi- ciently definite in urging that the study be continued, and in a fatherly spirit assists the young Cleinias to see that all the word-play of the sophists is only the first stage of a more serious initiation into an under- standing of the place of knowledge in conduct. Cleinias considers superfluous the proof that wisdom can be taught; 5 and, as Crito, to whom Socrates narrates the discussion, observes, he shows a logical Plato and of Aristotle (Varia Socratica, pp. 91 ff.). But the fallacies and the eristic of Antisthenes and of the Megarian school could hardly have persisted in a world that had put away these childish things. 1 Cf. p. 77. 2 Jowett, tr.

Crito must not be discouraged; philosophy is not dis- credited by the sophists: ' do not mind whether the teachers of phil- osophy are good or bad, but think only of philosophy herself.'2 This appeal to impersonality, more and more insistent in the dialogues, comes in the epilogue, and may fairly be considered Plato's own plea, spoken as directly as the dramatic form permits. The sophists have won a nominal victory,3 and have been complimented; now that the game is over, and a sober judgment is in order, we look at the thing impersonally; philosophy herself, rid of the sophists and their eristic, remains as our hope. Philosophy has yet to find a content;4 logic is only in the making, and some of the fallacies just ridiculed are not permanently downed; but the path is clear, and scepticism is not to recur. The Socrates of the Gorgias does not always avoid the eristic that he has just satirized in the Euthydemus. We need not on that account hold him, nor his sponsor Plato, guilty of wilful deception; logic is in slow process of being reformed. The skilful artist, too, whether serious or light-hearted, will not use too delicate an instrument for the matter in hand; and some minds are capable of appreciating a verbal argu- ment where they can not be trained to the understanding of more 1 Ibid., 288b-29Ia. It is worth noting that Socrates is not sure that young Cleinias was the speaker; it may have been some one else; it surely was not Euthy- demus or Dionysodorus, but perhaps 'some superior person.' ' Yes, indeed,' says Crito, ' some one a good deal superior, I should think.' It is by hints like this that Plato constantly goes out of his way to mark the progress of the argument; the tone is still dramatic, but 'the argument itself' is having its laugh. Cleinias, by the way, is the grandson of Alcibiades, who died in 404 B.C., at the age of forty-six. Alcibiades is referred to as iraXar6s; moreover his grandson, even by the greatest compression of generations that is probable, could hardly have taken part in such a discussion much before a time somewhat after the death of Socrates. It looks as if we have an intentional anachronism; and the attention of the reader is called to it by Plato in the passage just quoted. 2 Ibid., 307b. 3 Yet the nihilism of this sort of victory has been pointed out by Socrates with sufficient explicitness: the denial of the existence of error denies itself (ibid., 279e; cf. 297a). Socrates and Ctesippus show, by taking it up, that the game can be played with disastrous results to its champions; no age or want of capacity is an impediment (ibid., 304c). 4 Cf. ibid., 292e.</page><page sequence="20">82 William Chase Greene sound reasoning. Here Plato is the opportunist, justifying a faith which he firmly holds by a means that he would not wholly defend before those who could follow a more developed logic. Rhetoric is combated with verbal fencing; one extreme is met by another. The Gorgias, then, represents the triumph of right instinct (the right opinion of the Meno) over specious wrong-doing, established by a verbal reasoning that is impatient of detail. The purpose is ethical, and logic is for the moment subsidiary; the most effective weapon is paradox. Yet the paradoxes of the Gorgias are no idle invention; they represent the appeal from earthly well-being to the judgment of eternity and the world to come, quite in the spirit of the Apology, the Crito, and the Phaedo. Socrates keeps the pose of the inquirer, who wishes to analyze the ideas of others, and who is not sure how he is coming out; I but the pose is transparent. Socrates states his para- doxes first, and then argues in defense of them. At least, this is for him not new ground but the rehearsal of old convictions. At the same time, the Gorgias bears the marks of being a preliminary study, which the author will take up on subsequent occasions to be amplified or confirmed by closer reasoning. This Plato does on the rhetorical side in the Phaedrus, from the standpoint of ethics in the Republic, and of psychology in the Republic and the Philebus. The main positions of the Gorgias, to which instinct has led Plato, as it did Protagoras in the earlier dialogue, are not to be deserted; their logical foundation will be made more secure. From the logical point of view the Gorgias, when read after the Meno and the Euthydemus, comes with something of a shock; when the comedy of the dialogue is recognized, however, with the leading interlocutors put forward as stalking-horses for popu- lar notions and answered each in the manner that he deserves, it gains in power. It would be quite out of the question in a single en- counter to educate the elderly Gorgias and the hostile Polus and Cal- lias into a new life, as Socrates may hope to do in the case of his young friends and constant companions Glaucon and Phaedrus; but by floor- ing them on their own ground he can refute popular doctrines. The dramatic interplay of argument with character deserves to be followed in its general course. Gorgias and Socrates in turn define the art of rhetoric. Gorgias takes a personal view of it, and is inclined to 1 Gorgias, 455ab; cf. 505ef.</page><page sequence="21">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 83 point to concrete experience. Socrates, after a special plea to the great rhetorician to consider the matter disinterestedly,' shows that rhetoric by the nature of its relation to the other arts is either super- fluous or deceptive. Gorgias, who has already had to be coaxed to continue the discussion, now drops out silently, quite puzzled, remain- ing only as chairman of the debate that follows. Polus becomes im- patient as well as mystified 2 at the distinction made by Socrates be- tween &amp; a3OKE? . .. . XrTLCra and 'a pobXovrat. He no sooner recovers from this concession than he is compelled to assent to a damaging distinction between means and end; he becomes cynical with regard to the advantages of tyranny, but is frankly incredulous when Socrates propounds the paradox that it is better to suffer than to commit in- justice. By an extreme example, Socrates shocks Polus into admitting a limitation set by justice; but Polus suspects that he is being tricked. He points to ' the facts,' and appeals to the opinion of the public, in the manner of the rhetorician, as Socrates observes. To Polus the paradox seems quite absurd, that one who is unjust is less wretched if he be punished.3 But his contrast of tormented with triumphant injustice is a mere bugaboo, not an argument, thinks Socrates; 4 as a matter of fact it is really another appeal to ' the facts,' which inten- sifies the dramatic opposition of this world to the world to come. At Socrates's reaffirmed conviction that injustice punished is less wretched than injustice unpunished, Polus can only laugh 5 and appeal to popu- lar feeling. The counter-appeal of Socrates is to only one witness, a-rbYv rp6s &amp;v bvtot 6 X6Aom ,.6 He then sustains his former paradox by a verbal quibble, good enough for the occasion, and makes his bow to Polus, the one witness needed. Without letting him interrupt, he rapidly shows, by somewhat better reasoning, that to do injustice and go scot-free is worse than to do it and face the music; " alvETrat," is the reluctant admission of Polus. If all this be admitted, rhetoric is useless. Polus admits the steps of the argument; but the result still seems to him absurd.' He should have made his objection earlier; he should have maintained that justice is not a desideratum; but he had not the courage of his convictions.8 x Gorgias, 457c-458b. 2 Ibid., 467b. j Ibid., 473a. * Ibid., 473cd.

But first he raises the question whether Socrates is not jesting;1 Chaere- ophon reassures him. Socrates bases on the one point that Callias and he have in common, - their infatuation for their respective favorites, and for their idols, the G67os and 4tXouoota, - his dec- laration that Callias ought to understand how Socrates must per- force follow the dictates of Lady Philosophy and of consistency, even at the cost of disagreement with popular judgments. The appeal invites sympathy, if not argument; there is no logical ground why Callias should make concessions, for his community with So- crates, if it really exists, is one of temperament, not of common reasoning. Callias, the frank champion of naturalism, opposes the justice of convention. As for philosophy, it is a pretty thing, and a necessary part of the liberal education of the young; but it is foolish- ness for grown men.2 It would do Socrates no good, were he to be unjustly imprisoned and put on trial. Socrates is not in the least offended; at last he has an enlightened opponent. Gorgias and Polus were too modest, and contradicted themselves and public opinion; 3 Callias is a foeman worthy of his steel. Socrates shows that by admitting that PEXrtOW is equivalent to KPELT'rTC, which, in turn, is tantamount to lcXvp6brpos, Callias has wiped out the distinc- tion between o4vots and v6Pos. Callias is indignant: this is mere verbal nonsense!4 He professes to define P3EXrtlw as cpoVpl&amp;'rEpos; but Socrates, who disclaims the imputation of verbal quibbling,5 arouses his anger by testing the new definition by its application in the various trades. Callias rejects it, and decides that what he really means, after all, is that PEXirtw is the equivalent of avbipeos, - in fact, real dbbatiovia is simply self-gratification. No false modesty here, as Socrates exclaims.6 He can not move Callias by showing that happi- ness of such a sort is like a leaky vessel; but he does wring from him the admission that pleasures vary in quality, and that there is something unstable in a pleasure that is founded on such evils as hunger or thirst. The argument here, though not fallacious, is verbal, and lacks the necessary psychological basis: it is reflected in the surliness of Callias, who tries to wriggle out of the conclusion; 7 but the distinction be- 1 Gorgias, 48Ib. 2 Ibid., 485a. 3 Ibid., 487ab. * Ibid., 489bc. 6 Ibid., 490a. 6 Ibid., 492d. 7 Ibid., 497ab; 499b.</page><page sequence="23">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 85 tween &amp;dya06e and KaKOs remains, and the life of philosophy is now weighed in comparison with the claims of rhetoric. Now rhetoric, like drama, is flattery, and even its best practitioners have no standard, and do not really try to improve their audience. (At this point Callias sullenly refuses to argue; Socrates goes on with an imaginary conversation, emphasizing the points with which Cal- lias can not agree. But Callias is soon drawn into the discussion again.) It appears that to avoid suffering injustice involves accommodation to the powers that be; but this is not unqualifiedly worth while. At all events, statecraft requires skill and experience; and actual statesmen do not seem to have improved their citizens, for they have been over- thrown or disciplined. This last deduction seems somewhat unsound; Socrates should be the last person to hold that the failure to convert one's contemporaries implies a radical error in one's creed, or that worldly failure is a sign of lack of merit. But the passage is merely another instance of the adaptation of argument to interlocutor that we have already noted; nothing impresses Callias more strongly than an appeal to ' the facts.' Nevertheless Socrates expressly guards against the imputation to a teacher of the lapses of his renegade pupils:L the language is such as to call to one's mind the careers of Alcibiades and Critias, - another anachronism, perhaps, for our list.2 Unlike the statesman, Socrates now argues, he, the philosopher, has devoted his life to the real service of the city, nor do threats of persecution terrify him.3 He is a good physician; and though unable to help him- self (d~varros v ' avrcf poOle-ev), his resource is justice, so that he stands acquitted in the life to come. The Myth which he recounts in support of this contention is solemnly introduced as fact, not fiction, on Homeric authority. The earlier part of it is slightly comic in its jaunty style and in the spirit in which the prescriptions of a modern 1 Gorgias, 5I9e ff. 2 That the coming events do cast their shadows before should be obvious to any reader; and the Gorgias presumably deals with a time falling within the first years of the Peloponnesian War.

After 524b, where the consequences of the myth are drawn and Socrates makes his contribution, the tone becomes serious. The ideal judgement is contrasted with the possible miscarriage of justice in the event of Socrates being brought to trial; he will not be able to help himself, nor will Callias and the others be able to save themselves in the after- life. 'The argument' now steps forward and announces the conclu- sion; 1 the myth may be an old wives' tale,2 but it is the best account of the truth available, and though the other arguments have been dis- proved, this alone stands fast - the value of the life of justice. The conclusion is one that Gorgias, Polus, and Callias could by no means be expected to admit; it is a forecast by something like religious faith of things not seen and as yet hardly to be argued; the real argument comes later. What the Euthydemus has done for the beginnings of logic, the Cratylus does for the beginnings of philology. It is equally comic and equally satirical, but truth lurks behind the ridiculous even more tantalizingly. The pretense of ignorance and of inconclusiveness is therefore not equally kept up. The question is propounded: Is lan- guage natural or conventional ? The reader feels that Socrates, giv- ing a fair chance to the extreme views of both Cratylus and Hermo- genes, and himself taking the middle ground, is on the whole the mouth-piece of Plato, for all his ironical self-depreciation and his absurd illustrations of true principles. It is not hard to distinguish between the extravagant parody and the mock-modesty in which Socrates is surprised to discover accidentally the truth, or in which he pretends to reach it by borrowing ideas and by dreaming or guessing. He seems inspired; yes, he caught his inspiration from Euthyphro, who gave him a long lecture; 3 he has a new and ingenious thought; if he is not careful, he may be wiser than he ought to be before to- morrow's dawn.4 There is good reason, however, beyond that of the literary artist, for this pose; philology is a still weaker science than logic, and the responsibility for concrete statements is avoided by the double expedient of delegated authority and of comedy.

Plato is fond of sketching sciences and provinces of knowledge that the future must fill in, like solid geometry, in the Republic, and physical science, in the Timaeus. Unlike the sober writers of our day, he does not leave blanks where his knowledge ceases, but lets comedy fill the gap. Plato believes in the importance of etymologies; but not willing to commit himself to authentic examples, he tosses in specimens of current deri- vations together with inventions of his own. You can not convict him of error, for he can always plead the jester's privilege. Yet amid all the foolery, Socrates pauses to dispose of the foolish denial of the existence of falsehood that is based on a logical quibble: he can play the fool on occasion, but the quibble is becoming, in his opinion, too dangerous to be consciously tolerated,3 and common sense comes to the rescue. The end of the dialogue, too, becomes serious in tone. So- crates, though on the whole basing his theory of language on a com- promise that favors the position of Cratylus a little more than that of Hermogenes, will not admit that any " man of sense will like to put himself or the education of his mind in the power of names;' * especi- ally since there is an uncomfortable sense of insecurity in that they partake to a certain degree in the Heracleitean flux. Socrates, speak- ing as an older man, gently chaffs the young Cratylus about the perils of the flux; Cratylus is unconvinced, and, being allowed the last word in the dialogue, expresses his hope that Socrates will also continue to reflect on these matters. When we remember that Cratylus and Socrates were in turn the masters of Plato, this finale becomes highly amusing. The Heracleitean philosophy dies hard. III From the point of view of form, the Symposium is the most perfect comedy among the dialogues of Plato. Setting, characters, comic 1 Cratylus, 396c. 2 Rep., 528ef. I Cratylus, 429c ff. * Ibid., 440c.</page><page sequence="26">88 William Chase Greene relief, and plot are manipulated with consummate art. From the point of view of philosophic progress, the richness of form makes possible an interplay of personalities and ideas that gives a result not merely cumulative but architectural. Or, to change the figure, the light, at first prismatic, is later gathered into a white radiance by the mind of Socrates. For though all the first five encomia on love contribute points of lasting importance, they do not rise gradually to a climax, but serve as the materials from which Socrates builds his own dis- course. Incidentally the speech of Phaedrus contains not a little sophistic rhetoric; and that of Pausanias, which is ridiculed for its prose rhythm,' has poor logic and a 'weak ending,' as Eryximachus remarks.2 Eryximachus himself inclines to bring the whole discus- sion down to a matter of physics; so that the contrast with the farcical mythology of Aristophanes, who follows him, is the stronger. The hiccough of Aristophanes, which has postponed his speech, brings the comic poet's discourse also immediately before that of Agathon, the tragic poet, which is 'partly playful, yet partly serious.' " Aristo- phanes emphasizes in his fantastic vein the incompleteness of the lover; Agathon, holding that love is of beauty, and thus limiting its scope, delivers an extravagant and rhetorical panegyric on love. And now it is the turn of Socrates; indeed, he has with difficulty been pre- vented from thrusting an argument between two of the earlier speeches, and now that he has the floor he begins with a bit of dialectic. In the course of the speech that follows, he skilfully weaves in parts of the thought of all the previous speeches. But it is especially the speech of Agathon, his immediate predecessor, that gives him his cue. Love is of beauty, or of the good; but no man can love, or desire, that which he has. Jowett calls this distinction an obvious fallacy, and says that Socrates "almost acknowledges" it to be one.4 Socrates does admit, and even emphasize, the difference between loving what one has and desiring more of it, thus recognizing that love may be either of what one has or of what one has not; but for him at this moment the whole value of love is in its devotion to that which it has not, - to those abstract ideas of goodness and beauty that are not mere quantitative increases of good and beautiful things but qualitatively different 1 Symposium, 185c. 2 Ibid., 185e. 3 Ibid., I97e. 4 Jowett, tr.

He is accepting the point made by Aristophanes, without naming him explicitly; Iand he is thus enabled to transfer from love, which now becomes a neutral quality, to its object all the eulogy which Agathon, who has not made such a distinction, lavished on love itself. The distinction, far from being a fallacy, is an extension of the meaning of love, and of the conception of philosophy with which it is implicated. For philosophy, like love, mediates between mortal and immortal, between concrete and abstract, 'spanning the chasm.' 2 Love and philosophy thus stand in a mean between ignorance and wisdom, and we have pushed aside the old stumbling-block that we met in the Meno and the Euthydemus, - the question how one can seek what one does not know.3 And the way is prepared for the idealized contact with beauty and knowledge. Socrates has already disclaimed, with accustomed irony, his responsibility for this argument by saying that he received it from the wise Diotima; and it is from her that he pro- fesses to have received the conception of this new education in love and philosophy. Such a literary device enables Socrates to express the views of Plato without seeming discourteous to his host.4 The emotional pitch of the revelation is high; comic relief comes in the last act of the dialogue, with the boisterous entry of Alcibiades and his revellers, his strange panegyric on Socrates, and the picture of Socrates drinking the night long with Agathon and Aristophanes, the two banqueters who have given him the most help in his discourse. But, like the hiccough of Aristophanes and the other comic interludes, this satyric drama5 contributes more than comic relief. It gives Alcibiades a chance to descant on the character of Socrates, which in a way is itself a speech on love philosophized, exhibiting the results of the 'down' course of ideal love in the fleshly sphere. Socrates can not say, "Be- hold, I am not disobedient to the heavenly vision." It is therefore 1 But cf. Symposium, 205e. 2 Ibid., 2o2e: iav.u-XpoL.

Despite the grossness of his discourse, the point is that So- crates is the union of passion and chastity, the living embodiment of the experience recounted by Socrates himself. Coming from the lips of Alcibiades, the testimony is doubly impressive, as well as tremen- dously grotesque. And Plato proves, what Socrates here holds, that the same writer can combine tragedy and comedy; 1 for this philosophic mime, like the rest, is both a~rov6a&amp;os and 'yXotos. The Phaedo purports to give the conversation of Socrates on the last day of his life. If the dialogue is in general like the rest of the dialogues, we may expect to find in it on the whole a life-like picture of his personality; but we need not on that account expect an accurate report of his conversation, nor need we take every statement at its face value. That, at least, is the orthodox view of the dialogue, such as would conform with the statement of Taylor in his admirable little book on Plato.2 It seems as if Plato himself is giving us a special warning against any other view, since this is one of the very few pas- sages in which he mentions himself; and here it is only to tell us that he was not present at the scene that he narrates. What, then, are we to make of the recent suggestion of Taylor and Burnet,3 that the Phaedo is intended as a true account of the conversation, with the implication that any statements as to the earlier life of Socrates and his views are to be taken as historical evidence ? If the suggestion be accepted, we must believe that Socrates himself held on his dying day the 'doctrine of ideas' in a fairly well developed form, though he has hardly mentioned it before, and that his earlier interests were much more scientific than they have generally been supposed to be. Now it is unnecessary to labor the point, fully established by Burnet,4 that 1 Symposium, 223d. 2 A. E. Taylor, Plato, London, 1911, pp. 29-33. s A. E. Taylor, Varia Socratica, Oxford, 1911; J.

The whole question is about the purpose. In all the other dialogues, with the pos- sible exception of the Apology, it appeared that Plato's main purpose was not the presentation of facts or of the history of philosophy, but the free dramatic expression of the spirit of philosophy. Burnet rightly holds 1 that Plato succeeds better than Xenophon or than Aristophanes in depicting the Socratic 00os; but we must not there- fore take it for granted that he intends to give also the Socratic P3os and X6yos; for we know that where philosophical truth is involved Plato shows himself the heir of his master's ipwvEola. So, for example, Socrates may have been acquainted with the physical theories enum- erated by Burnet;2 the point is, was he formerly a believer in them, or does Plato concentrate into quasi-biographical form the philosophical progress of any one dealing with his problems ? The observer of Plato's manipulation of comedy, who has noticed the feigned agree- ment of Socrates with most of his opponents at some stage in the other dialogues, will incline to feel that there is nothing surprising if Plato does not seriously mean us to believe that Socrates was in his youth a devotee of physical science. At the most, we need suppose only that he took a layman's interest in what gossip about the subject came to him, weighing it from that ethical point of view that appears so clearly in the present account;3 even the philosophy of Anaxagoras he ex- amined only in a book.4 Yet it need not startle us greatly if the whole episode was invented by Plato out of whole cloth. In favor of its verisimilitude we have, to be sure, the striking resemblance, estab- lished by Taylor and Burnet, between the picture in the Phaedo and the caricature in the Clouds of Aristophanes.5 But, to offset this resem- blance, we have in the Apology, a dialogue which we found cause to 1 J.

The picture drawn by Aristophanes, moreover, striking though it be, need not be solemnly invoked as historical. It is recognized that the intimate relation of Socrates to the inferior brand of sophists, suggested by the play, is not historical; if Aristophanes succumbed to the temptation to paint such a picture, is he to be trusted for a moment when he rakes up the notions of twenty years ago and attributes them to Socrates ? Well, men did believe in such theories in the youth of Socrates; and it would be a ready way of raising a laugh to father them on the mature So- crates. The public would not discriminate: or if some of the audience of the Clouds knew better than to confuse Socrates with physical speculators, the joke was for them all the better. May we be as ready to treat comedy as comedy! If we want serious testimony about the youthful interests of Socrates, we may more profitably turn to the Protagoras of Plato. There it appears that Socrates had already at- tracted the notice of the veteran sophist and humanist by 445 B.C.5 In view of the interests of Protagoras himself and of the subjects dis- cussed in the dialogue that bears his name, is it likely that it was scientific interests that had won for Socrates such a reputation as to meet with the generous approval of the arch-humanist ? Not to deny absolutely any such interest to the youthful Socrates, it seems more reasonable to hold that his chief preoccupation at all times was ethical and logical. It is by this time sufficiently clear, I trust, that some, at least, of the difficulties of the Phaedo depend not so much on matters of chronology as on an understanding of Plato's method and point of view. As soon 1 Cf. p. 71, n. 5- 2 Apology, i8d, I9c. 3 Ibid., 18, I9, et passim. 4 Ibid., 33af. 5 "Some years before he [Socrates] had reached the age of thirty." Taylor, Varia Socratica, p. 143.</page><page sequence="31">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 93 as it is recognized that the Phaedo, like the other dialogues, is a philo- sophical mime, many of these difficulties disappear. Socrates no longer stands as an historical figure, but becomes the personification of the philosopher; the dialogue is no longer a personal record, but an interpretation of the life and death of Socrates, together with all that they imply and have come to mean to Plato. The relation between Xenophon and Plato, as witnesses of Socrates, and that between the Synoptic evangelists and St. John, in their accounts of Jesus, present a familiar parallel; it is worth while to remember the direction in which recent study of the fourth gospel has tended. I will quote from Pare Calmes, a Roman Catholic who writes, with the approbation of the papal censor, of this gospel: " It seems to us impossible not to admit that we have here dogmatic developments explicable rather by the evangelist's habits of mind than by the actual words of Jesus . History is seen through the intervening dogmatic development." The Abb6 Loisy regards the evangelist as "a theologian far removed from every historical preoccupation." These writers, to be sure, do not attribute the gospel to John the son of Zebedee. F. von Htigel, in his article on the Gospel according to John, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (from which I quote the dicta given above), writes: "By insisting upon having history in the same degree and way in John as in the Synoptists, we cease to get it sufficiently anywhere at all." He finds in John "traditional, largely historical, materials everywhere handled with a sovereign freedom," and the "mystic's deep love for double, even treble meanings." The threefold interpretation that Dante applied to his Commedia might be cited as a further parallel; but it had better be said quite definitely that Plato's good sense kept him from obscurantism. The fourth gospel would in several ways be in- explicable without Philo Judaeus and Paul: the literary descent from Plato to John is thus not altogether negligible. Now from these cir- cumstances it would be dangerous to argue that Plato's procedure was the same as that of the later writers, who differed from him in race, to mention only one fundamental particular. But the parallel does justify us in holding that Plato need by no means have considered himself a chronicler when he dealt with the most solemn moments of his master's life. If we find that he represents him as entertaining views on that occasion which the real Socrates seems to have held</page><page sequence="32">94 William Chase Greene lightly, if at all, we need not accuse him of "heartless mystification;"' we should remember that literary standards have changed.2 The discussion of immortality in the Phaedo shows a distinct advance over the equivocal references to the subject in the Apology and the ap- peal to orthodox views in the Crito and the Gorgias. It is, of course, pos- sible that Socrates spoke on the subject on the last day of his life, and, if so, he doubtless spoke with greater earnestness and profundity than ever before. But the fusion of various arguments in support of immor- tality seems hardly Socratic. The paradox that philosophy is a medi- tatio mortis can be paralleled in Pythagorean or Orphic dogma; and the doctrine of ideas has roots in the every-day, as well as in the scientific, language of the fifth century.3 But the full development of the doctrine and the use of it to establish the paradox has no parallel and is purely Platonic.4 The omnipresent Pythagorean coloring of the Phaedo may easily be Plato's own introduction, the result of his contact with Pythagorean influences in Hellas and in Magna Graecia; and his dramatic sense finds a good chance to use it by making the semi-Pythagoreans, Simmias and Cebes, the chief interlocutors of Socrates; for they would be a highly sympathetic audience for the sentiments that Plato wishes to set forth. It should be noticed, on the other hand, that the more important contributions to the argu- ment come, not from these young men, who after all are only partially Pythagoreans, but from their senior, Socrates. Cebes and Simmias have to be instructed about the doctrine of their reputed master, Philolaus; and Socrates knows of it only by hearsay.5 Lest it be replied that this is only Plato's device for avoiding a monotonous piece of exposition, it is enough to remark that nowhere else does Plato employ such a roundabout device. It seems clear, therefore, that the char- acteristic doctrines of the Phaedo are Platonic, and that the setting in which they are found is due to his sense of dramatic fitness: a dis- cussion on immortality could not be given to Socrates on any other occasion so appropriately as on his last day. He could attribute it to 1 Burnet, ed. Phaedo, p. xii. 2 For example, plagiarism was once respectable. a The evidence has been conveniently stated by Taylor in Varia Socratica. 4 That the ideas are implicit in the method of Socrates may be granted, but not such an hypostatization of them as marks the Phaedo. 5 Phaedo, 6id.</page><page sequence="33">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 95 Socrates without violence to the truly Socratic doctrines, but only by virtue of a good deal of " interpretation " and adjustment.' Simmias and Cebes supply the sympathetic audience; and some of the doctrine is represented as familiar to them, and as often discussed with them. That obviously does not mean that Socrates as a matter of history learned certain Pythagorean doctrines from his younger associates; 2 at the most it would merely hint at dialogues, never written or never transmitted to us, in which the present speakers set forth the doctrines here accepted as true. Burnet asks: "Did any philosopher ever pro- pound a new theory of his own by representing it as already familiar to a number of distinguished contemporaries ?" " Plato, at least, did not hesitate to do so; the cardinal virtues, for example, though intro- duced in the Republic as familiar and accepted, are clearly part of Plato's regular teaching, but are nowhere demonstrated.4 The nature of the general problem, which is a literary one, rather than an historical puzzle, was sufficiently recognized by Burnet many years ago: "When Plato deliberately attributes some of his own most important discov- eries to the Pythagoreans, he [is] acknowledging in a characteristic way the debt he [owes] them." 5 "He [Plato] is apt to develop Pytha- goreanism on lines of his own; . . . he is not careful, however, to claim the authorship of his own improvements in the system . He is . . . quite willing to credit Timaios the Lokrian, or 'ancient sages' generally with theories which certainly had their birth in the Academy."6 This literary device even led to charges of plagiarism.7 The Phaedo marks, if I understand it correctly, a conscious step from Socratic to Platonic doctrine. A number of the earlier dialogues have almost imperceptibly substituted interpretation and high comedy for record, and have shown an impersonal X6-yos as the real protago- 1 For a Johannine parallel, one may cite the fourteenth to the seventeenth chapters, in which subjects ignored by the synoptic evangelists are treated. 2 As Burnet and Taylor seem to argue. 3 Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy2, p. 355. 4 Cf.

Socrates will ap- pear again, but it will be even less than ever the "real" Socrates of history. Socratic irony, of course, persists; but it is more and more a mask for dogmatic affirmation. The difficulty which Socrates en- counters with regard to the nature of the unit in the Phaedo 1 will recur in the Parmenides 2 and the Philebus ;3 but Plato assumes the point as clear in the Republic.4 That the difficulties attributed to the Socrates of the Phaedo are ironical we might guess from such phrases as abrbs ElK7 4kipOC and %-Xepos oITros 6 applied to the new method of the speaker, and KOY4Eta, 'subtlety,' used of the ordinary way of speaking of such things. The whole performance is certainly ob&amp;bv KatVoV, as Socrates says, but it is not 'mystification.' The myth of the Phaedo, too, in its philosophical bearing a forecast of the Cave of the Republic, is quite in keeping with the Socratic '0os, with its grotesque dramatis personae of fish and frogs. On the formal side, however, the Phaedo shows a relation to the other dialogues rather too subtle to be the result of the artless conversation even of a Socrates. Its language simulates at times that of a defense in court; 8 but it is the converse of the Apology. In the earlier instance, Socrates pleaded formally, at least, for life, against those who wished to put him to death; here he defends his readiness to die against those who deplore his death. Crito has now to be persuaded of the opposite of that which he forced the judges to believe; then it was the fact that Socrates would remain, now it is that he will not remain.9 A somewhat similar contrast di- vides the Phaedo from the Symposium: the disciple of Diotima found in the ideal world a preoccupation for life; here it is the justification of death. All this is the work of that paradox of philosophy as a medi- tatio mortis that Plato seems to have appropriated from the mysteries. The result is too grave a matter, perhaps, for comedy; but it throws the light of hope over tragedy. 1 Phaedo, 96de. 2 Parmenides, I37c. 3 Philebus, 56d. 4 Republic, 525d ff. 5 Phaedo, 97b. 6 Ibid., 99c. ?

And one element, more than anything else, gives scope for exquisite comedy, - the contrast be- tween an ideal world, often conceived as being to a certain degree realized, and this world of change and decay. The charting of the ideal world is of primary importance, and the contrast only incidental; but the contrast recurs again and again. For one thing, no weapon is so strong as satire when the claims of pretenders are to be opposed; so the sophists, the poets, the tyrants, and all the powers of this life in turn suffer from the shafts of ridicule. And Plato knows, too, that he is describing a kingdom not on earth, but in heaven; his powers of description will certainly fail him at times, and his failures can most conveniently be concealed in Parthian volleys of comedy. The comedy is perhaps most keen when Plato is most impatient of the impediments that keep him, and that, as he knows, must always keep him, from demonstrating the Heavenly City as something more than an ideal. His Socrates asks permission 'to keep holiday, like lazy-minded men, who feast themselves on their own thoughts when travelling alone. They do not wait to discover the means of attaining the object of their desires; they let that question alone to save them- selves the weariness of deliberating about what is practicable and what is not. They suppose they have what they desire (OETES s v7rapXov ELYaLt 0 3oXovraL), and then proceed to arrange the remainder of the business, and amuse themselves by enumerating all they will do when their desire is realized, so making their already lazy minds even lazier.' 1 So Socrates defers questions of practicability; but he is not the less critical of all that usurps the position that he claims for his ideals. Though his Republic is at times a mere ideal of the imagi- nation,2 and is often explicitly marked as such,3 it is at times regarded 1 Rep., 458a. 2 Cf. Ibid., 471c ff.; 534c; 592ab.

The possibility rests on a famous proviso: the Republic can exist only when kings are philosophers and philosophers are kings.2 Si le roi savait, si le philosophe pouvait! But how much virtue in that "if"! Even an approximation to the Utopian ideal may be of value,3 and even the Heavenly city itself needs the services of a living legislator;4 but changes must be radical, and Plato has little faith in the value of half-way measures, the efforts of 'charming' tinkers and patchers.5 Notice the transition; a man may be pardoned for believing that he is six feet tall, if he has no standard.6 The Socrates of the Republic does not lack a standard; his difficulty is in persuading others to adopt it. As usual, the tone is one of irony and extravagant apology. Socrates has recourse to a 'magnificent lie';'7 his hearers do not wonder that he is 'ashamed to propound such fiction' as the myth of Cadmus, which, to be sure, is incredible in this generation, though it may be credible in the next.s Socrates pretends more than once that he is unwilling to continue the argument;' he expects, and receives, the waves of ridicule that are ready to overwhelm him;10 he hesitates long to speak his para- doxical suggestion."1 'All that can be said of the extravagance of Plato's proposals is anticipated by himself.'12 The pretended evasion of certain topics merely marks the difficulty of speaking on them in such a way as to carry conviction.13 Not lack of will, but lack of ability may hinder Socrates from showing how a city can entertain philosophy without being destroyed by it.14 The Good has 'often' been men- tioned, but 'we have no proper knowledge of it;'15 yet it is the most important of all subjects. The views of others are refuted; but So- crates shirks further discussion of it.16 Here is frankness at last: Plato gives nowhere any more satisfactory account of the Good, for it is an 1 Rep., 389d; 416d; 45ocd; 466d, 499d; 502c. 2 Ibid., 473cd.

The eva- sion is an example of Plato's common device for avoiding the exposi- tion of a difficult subject, which he reserves for oral discussion.2 It is hardly worth while to rehearse the many occasions of Plato's satirical treatment of false pretenders in the Republic. Some of his attacks are important enough, however, to deserve special note. The shrewd comments on human nature that appear in the accounts of the transformations of governments 3 are something more than satire on existing governments, flavored with metaphors from animal life, and possibly with allusions to real men. All is viewed from the vantage ground of the philosopher sub specie aeternitatis, and thus becomes a subject for pity, if not for contempt. Suave mari magno. . . . But Plato is no quietist; the worthlessness of the world is for him a chal- lenge, not the warrant for indifference. The sophists are in general treated with contempt. The poets, as individual writers, fare ill; Homer is often quoted with ironical approval, but the satire is directed quite as much against the interpreters of Homer as against the poet himself. Yet the art of poetry gains in dignity, so far as it shares in the universals of philosophy.4 The treatment of poetry in the last book of the Republic presents a special difficulty; for it is inconsistent with the argument of the earlier books. The difficulty vanishes, as I have shown elsewhere, when it is recognized that the contrast in the tenth book is between poetry as it exists and an unattainable ideal of philosophy; it should be read as comedy. The vantage ground from which the attack is made appears again in the sequel; the rest of the book continues the contrast between the ideal world and the injustice of this life.5 It is in a certain sense a compliment to poetry to single it out, as the most formidable rival of philosophy, for the renewed dis- cussion of the tenth book. Yet there may be a more immediate mo- 1 Cf. Plato's View of Poetry, pp. 45-50. 2 For another example, there is the reply to Glaucon: he can not follow Socrates in the study of dialectic (Rep., 533a.) Cf. also Symposium, 209ef. 3 Rep. VIII. 4 This and the following point are discussed in detail in Plato's View of Poetry, PP- 34-38; 50-56. 5 The myth of Er, for all its grandeur, contains shrewd bits of comedy; the fates of Ardiaeus the tyrant, of Orpheus, Ajax, Thersites, and Odysseus, project sev- erally their earthly ?0os against the background of eternity.</page><page sequence="38">I00 William Chase Greene tive: it is possible that Plato feels a measure of resentment toward Aristophanes for the ridicule of Socrates in the Clouds.' Aristophanes and Socrates, as guests of Agathon, appear in the Symposium on good terms; but it is not inconceivable that Plato, who always reserves his most vehement attacks for types rather than for individuals, and who becomes increasingly intolerant of rivals to the claims of philosophy, sees an opportunity in the Republic to retaliate against the whole tribe of poets; comedy is vanquished by comedy. But the point lies outside the possibility of demonstration. Much more simple is the defense of philosophy against the charge of uselessness.2 Socrates admits that as matters stand the philosophers are rogues, if bad, and fools, if good. The answer, as we should expect, consists of the comic contrast be- tween true and false standards. After narrating the parable of the ship, with its noble but deaf master, and its crew who have no notion of the principles of navigation, Socrates proceeds to throw the blame for the disrepute of philosophers on the public, who corrupt them and do not give them an untrammelled opportunity for practising their art. So philosophy is dishonored by inferior men, mere mechanics: it is like the little, bald tinker 'who marries his master's daughter.' Yet the public are not wholly to blame, nor are they wholly bad: they are in turn corrupted by 'outsiders who have burst in like drunken revel- lers where they have no right, who abuse and wrangle with one an- other, and spend their whole time in personalities and in behavior that is entirely unbecoming to philosophy.'" The real philosopher, of course, has no time for such conduct. Plato has already commended to us the 'noble lie.' 4 The funda- mental principles of lying are boldness, consistency, and detail. If you wish a lie to be believed, you must make it circumstantial. Plato's appreciation of this principle, in the exploitation of the ideal common- wealth, accounts for much that seems obscure. On the purely literary side, one may note the wealth of detail that secures plausibility for the 1 Cf. Apology, i8d; 19c; Rep., 6o6c; Laws, 658 ff.; Ibid., 817. Adam thinks it probable that in Rep.

The great difficulty in the commonwealth, he says, is in its institution; 2 accordingly, to make the notion plausible, he actually suggests the first step in launching the new state: all the inhabitants of the state above the age of ten are to be banished, in order to give the philosopher- guardians full opportunity, without contaminating influences, to initiate the rising generation. The proposal is not altogether arbitrary, unpractical though it may be; but it is significant chiefly of Plato's regular method of filling the lacunae that are bound to exist in his mediation between actual and ideal conditions,- the injection of detail, in serio-comic vein. Such is the method of his philosophy of history in the eighth book. The sequence of states that he sketches is not an historical one; nor can history be derived by any such a priori method. Plato probably realized this as well as we; and symptoms of his embarrassment are the sudden institution of the ideal state, and the arbitrarily conceived descent of the timocratic man from the re- tired statesman, a patent non sequitur. The atmosphere of comedy, indeed, pervades this whole discussion. What is the principle of change in the state ? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us ' how discord first arose ? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest ?' 3 The reply of the Muses proceeds to rest the whole matter on the principle of growth and decay in organisms,- a sensible enough answer, provided that it be applied sensibly, - and on the manipula- tion of the 'perfect number,' which governs birth,- a reply which means everything and nothing. No doubt Plato had a certain faith in Pythagorean formulae and modes of attacking problems; no doubt, too, analysis has shown the basis in symbolism on which the 'perfect number' is constructed. But only a very credulous reader will as- cribe to Plato any confidence in the value of the particular number that he has constructed. He holds that there is an element of quantity or proportion in all things; but his attempt to apply the general no- tion of quantity to the case in hand is mathematical comedy, of which the appeal to the Muses gave us timely warning, if warning were I Cf.

"The episode," he says, "like many other passages in Plato, is half-serious, and half-playful."' The comic vein is sus- tained in the following argument, with its reference to the metals previously introduced under the aegis of the 'noble lie ; '2 and for the whole theory the Muses are again solemnly made responsible, and the Muses "must needs speak truly."'3 It is in such a tone that Plato lets comedy fill the cracks in the fair structure of his city. And not incon- ceivably his chief reason for feeling that they should be somehow filled is his unwillingness to admit that any ordinary cause could bring to pass the downfall of his state, if it has been once established. The 'perfect number' is not the only example of Plato's arbitrary use of mathematics to substantiate a preconceived position. The same semi- serious, semi-jocose spirit plays about the tremendous difference be- tween the life of the king and that of the tyrant, and evolves the 'tyrant's number.'4 Again the manipulation of the mathematical reckoning includes arbitrary steps in order to attain the number, 729, which Plato evidently intends to reach.5 The whole passage is the fanciful statement of serious truth; strictly speaking, you can not get a good (or a positive sum) by multiplying a bad (or a negative sum), for the difference is qualitative; but you can by such a calculation suggest to the imagination the infinite 6 difference in happiness between the just and the unjust life.7 1 Adam, ed. Rep., II, note on 545c ff. The first Appendix to Book VIII, a monu- ment of learning and acute interpretation, shows the number to be intelligible: but Adam is duly cautious in ascribing to Plato any serious regard for these specu- lations.

An actor does not make his exits and his entrances without the connivance of the dramatist; and the dramatist in this instance is Plato. The movement of the plot of the Republic is extraordinarily interesting. Socrates is what the play- wright would call a developing character; in his hands the argument changes from inquiry and scepticism to dogmatic and spiritual affirma- tion. The progress is worth defining. In the first book, Socrates is the investigator who explodes false notions without offering any solution of his own, and who in the end confesses ignorance.2 This book, to- gether with the earlier pages of the second book,3 are not unlike the early dialogues: for superficial views of justice are thrown into the form of comedy, and the upshot is mainly negative. So popular morality finds its champion in Cephalus, shallow argument in Pole- marchus, and sophistic contentiousness in Thrasymachus. Socrates easily disposes of these false views. Glaucon and Adeimantus, as diaboli advocati, now present the position of justice in the eyes of this world,4 and of the gods.5 Their arguments, which run counter to their own convic- tions, represent superficially, like the previous views, 'the facts,' which remain, for what they are worth, despite all the high discourse and the ideal commonwealth that is to come. Plato means to leave no un- guarded positions in the rear; and the objections of Glaucon and Adei- mantus, made early in the second book, are sound, as far as they go. From the worldly point of view, justice does not always pay; but, as Plato goes on to prove, that does not mean that the claims of justice should be pursued wholly on grounds of policy.6 In the rest of the poetry, likewise in the interests of a special interest (cf. Plato's View of Poetry, pp. 50 ff.). To the sober-minded reader who needs explicit warning from Plato him- self against taking too seriously the fantastic conception of the 'tyrant's number,' we may commend the remark that the sophist, the statesman, and the philosopher are separated by an interval which no mathematical ratio can express (Politicus, 257b). 1 Rep., 451C. 2 Ibid., 354bc. 3 Ibid., 327 to 368. 4 Ibid., 358e ff. 5 Ibid., 363a ff. 6 Strictly, the Socrates of the Republic side-steps, and never really answers the objections of Glaucon and Adeimantus. He does not say, " Be good, and you will be happy," but, 'Be good, and you will not care whether you are happy or not.' Blessedness takes the place of happiness. Then faith takes up the work of reason, and the rewards of righteousness are reckoned in.

Glaucon and Adeimantus, whose better nature has already forestalled the Socratic position with regard to the need of investigating justice itself apart from its consequences, now lag in the argument. Glaucon, to be sure, does enliven the discussion from time to time with his humor, and his brother brings to bear a graver mind on the more serious questions;' but they contribute comparatively little that is constructive. In the next three books, they become mere puppets, and Socrates dogmatizes freely. Dramatic instinct would prefer that the brothers should bring forward the views of the idea of the Good that are to be weighed and discarded; but Socrates brings them for- ward himself. Every sign tells us that the discussion is no longer one of the inquiries of the midwife Socrates, but a lecture from the Acad- emy. The dialogue form, however, arrests the dogmatic tendency, or, at least, corrects it at times. Adeimantus distrusts the results of the reasoning of Socrates: driven from position to position and silenced, like an unskilful player at draughts, he holds that a number of small false moves have accumulated to cause his defect.2 Socrates half ad- mits the force of the accusation, but justifies his point in the present instance (on the value of philosophy). The objection of Adeimantus would have no place here if Plato did not mean us to perceive that he realizes the danger of dogmatism without a genuine opposition. It is not the dangers of the Socratic mode of reasoning, as Jowett holds,3 is instructive. The spirit of the last part of the Republic is not unlike that of the last part of the Book of Job, and is similarly inconsistent with the earlier argument. 1 The difference in character between the brothers is well described by Jowett, tr. Plato, III, pp. xii ff. Part of Glaucon's by-play appears to be on his part un- intentionally humorous: in the sketch of the philosopher's education he interposes the practical application of each branch, whether mischievously, or, as Plato seems to intend, through lack of comprehension (Rep., 522 if.). But Socrates has no use for the shop-keeping view of mathematics or the sentimental view of astronomy: existing science is insecure (ibid., 533). Again, Glaucon's amusing misunderstand- ing of the meaning of Socrates with regard to the study of music is, after a fashion, a play within a play, satire within satire, and serves, like the other betises just noted, to emphasize the purely theoretical nature of the education that Socrates proposes. For this sort of emphasis, cf. also Symposium, 2o9e f., and Rep., 528ab. 2 Rep., 487b ff.

Adei- mantus is too far beyond his depth to serve the purpose very effec- tively; the Socratic method must be either revived or discarded. But the Socrates of this dialogue proceeds practically unchallenged here- after. Glaucon has spoken for both his brother and himself: 'If you treat me as a follower who is able only to see what is shown to him, you will treat me fairly enough,' I In other words the Socratic method is used now only from force of habit, and Plato is his own critic.2 He does, indeed, treat in the last three books such matters as the real Socrates might have discussed; but the treatment is wholly Platonic. And Socrates, who at first was the man of flesh and blood, has been transformed almost imperceptibly into the type of the philosopher, the mouth-piece of Plato himself. Needless to say, the illusion of the historical Socrates is barely sustained; something like an allusion to his fate occurs more than once, naturally in generalized terms.3 One must not press unduly what may after all be only a personal impression: but to me, at least, it seems as if the greater richness of Plato's language in the Republic, especially in his comic sallies, ac- companies the transformation of the original Socrates into the Platonic philosopher. Socrates was himself, we know well enough, a wag with a taste for odd twists of speech; yet in none of the earlier sketches of Socrates does he speak in so racy a vein, nor are his figures so vivid. In the Republic, the Socratic illustration becomes the Platonic parable or allegory, often subtly comic, - the Cave, the Captain of the Ship, 1 Rep., 432c. Cf. 533a. Socrates takes Glaucon at his word, and proclaims the result of an argument in the name of Glaucon (ibid., 580). 2 I am aware that this is not the usual interpretation of this passage; but it seems to me the natural one. Notice the difference between the accusation against Socrates in Meno, 8o, - that he bewilders those who talk with him (Socrates is there represented as mainly, though not wholly, the investigator not committed to a conclusion), - and the present accusation (Rep., 487b ff.). The point is empha- sized in the Phaedrus (275d ff.); a written speech, unchallenged, 'dead,' is irre- sponsible, uncontrollable, incapable of adapting itself to an audience, and hence leads to misunderstanding. 3 Cf. Rep., 360e ff.; 492a; 517a. References to the fate of Alcibiades seem not improbable (494b; cf. 560).

Sometimes a metaphor is familiar,- a philosophical inquiry con- ceived under the guise of a hunt; 1 but the more humorous figures crop up, as it were, on the spur of the moment: music, 'pouring like water through the funnel of a man's ears, wears away the edge of his soul; '2 the contrast between the soldiers of the ideal state and those of neigh- boring states under the image of lean dogs and fatted sheep, or of trained boxers and corpulent opponents; 3 evil stories about the gods are to be told only after the sacrifice of some all but unprocurable animal; 4 the soul in this life is like the sea-god Glaucus, encrusted with barnacles.5 Such drolleries are doubtless to be found in the earlier dialogues, and the graver dialogues of Plato's later years dis- close them but seldom; but it would not be profitable to dispute who is the greater humorist, Socrates or Plato. It is enough to notice the wealth of humor that enlivens the Republic, and to remember how far it is taking us from the simple, though baffling, interrogations of Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus. Though the doctrine of the Phaedrus is sufficiently Platonic, and the Socrates is patently the mouth-piece of Plato's dogmatism, the setting of the dialogue is such as to preserve much of the personality of Socrates. He is, moreover, the same quizzical fellow whom we have often met before. He toys with Phaedrus, and makes him produce the manuscript of the speech of Lysias that Phaedrus admires so much. He affects great admiration for it, and is barely persuaded to deliver a speech of his own; but he delivers it with rare skill, inspired, he thinks, by the place in which he speaks, a place dedicated to the nymphs.6 Of course its attack on love is ironical; yet it is not wholly ironical, for it contains much that is true, and though seeming to oppose love it really only makes a distinction between kinds of love, somewhat in the spirit of the Symposium. Nevertheless, there is something shocking about this negative attitude; and Socrates is urged by his familiar sign to sing a palinode to atone for his blasphemy against Eros. The Rep., 432b; cf.

He continues his discourse from a sense of duty; the grasshoppers will report it to the Muses. Now that the ground has been cleared of false notions of love and false standards of rhetoric by this comic but wholly easy and natural bit of drama, Socrates proceeds to discuss the point that his palinode has already illustrated: the principles of a true or philosophic rhetoric, based on knowledge of the truth, that is, of ideas. Well, his second speech was playful, yet partly true in its adherence to the principles of generalization and division;2 and the rest of his discourse consists largely of the develop- ment of these points.3 At last ' the game is played out,'4 and the con- clusion is soberly stated: writers and talkers of all kinds are justified only when their work is based on knowledge of truth. We shall never know with just how much seriousness Plato wrote the pages of the Phaedrus that depreciate the value of the written word, and give high praise to conversation because it is living and therefore philosophical. It might be argued that they are wholly flippant, for the dialogue itself is a written work. On the other hand, we know that it was Plato's own practice to reserve for oral discussion many difficult matters; in his time philosophy dealt in words that were barely defined and were easily capable of misinterpretation. That is the reason why unchallenged dogmatism was so dangerous, as Plato himself realized; 5 and that is the reason for the peculiar value of the Socratic method, when sincerely practised. Socrates in the Phaedrus admits that the Egyptian ' tale' was invented to introduce his point: but the real point is the truth conveyed by the story, as he 1 I have already called attention to a comic touch in the myth that should not be overlooked, - the relative rank of the various professions (cf.

Probably we shall not appreciate Plato's full meaning if we take him wholly in earnest or wholly in jest: 'in a written discourse, whatever the subject, there must of necessity be much that is sportive. The best of them are nothing else than reminders of what we know.' That may be the principle on which we may best understand the Phae- drus as a whole. V In view of the abstract nature of the subjects treated in the 'dia- lectical' dialogues, their comic phases strike one as many and sur- prising. Though the Theaetetus beyond doubt belongs to this group, its dramatic traits have often led readers to place it much earlier. But the character of Socrates is more Socratic than the argument. The discussion is described as a game: whoever misses shall sit down, as at a game of ball, and shall be ' donkey,' as the boys say; he who outlasts his competitors without missing shall be 'king.' 2 The friends of Socrates, adopting the language of the palaestra, in which they are speaking, twit him with wishing to 'try a fall with all com- ers.' 3 Yet there is no taint of professionalism in his attitude; unlike the sophists, who are fond of making a sparring-match over arith- metical contradictions, he and Theaetetus wish only to establish the relation of principles;4 but he must guard against being satisfied with a merely verbal victory, and must not crow too soon.' Quite in keep- ing with the earlier pictures of Socrates are the mock respect for Homer 6 and the biting satire on Euripides.' The figures of speech seem to me more akin to those of the Republic than to those of the earlier dialogues; knowledge, for example, conceived as impressions on wax, or as an aviary, or as the Trojan horse.8 Apart from the remark that the conversation is a game, the point of view is suggested by the digression and the recurrent references to the obstetric art of Socrates, who offers only other people's wisdom, not his own.9 How far this attitude is ironical depends, naturally, on 1 Phaedrus, 275bc. 2 Theaetetus, 146a.

We notice in the first place that all the attempts to define knowledge appear to fail, whether they are in terms of Heracleitus and Protagoras, or of impressions on a tabula rasa, or of true opinion defined and explained. The Heracleitean hypothesis is apparently accepted,' only to be rejected. The imaginary speech of Protagoras is dignified, and though it may represent Plato's notion of what Pro- tagoras logically ought to have said to fill out his case, rather than the actual utterances of Protagoras, it is as notably fair-minded in its treatment of the arch-sophist as the dialogue that bears his name. But Socrates has launched a barbed arrow against the fundamental position of Protagoras: and it is irresistible. One is as little likely to forget or to deny the criticism of Socrates, phrased humorously in terms of pigs and dog-headed beasts 2 as to lose the point of the on- slaught of Xenophanes on anthropomorphism with its analogy in terms of oxen. If truth is relative, there is no possibility of comparison or of certainty. And the other proposed solutions of the problem of knowledge prove equally unsatisfactory; they are only 'wind-eggs.' Yet the result is not wholly inconclusive. Socrates realizes that in- ability to frame a definition must not deter him from reasoning.3 On the negative side we have learned that knowledge is neither sensation nor the irresponsible work of the mind; on the positive side, we find the rudiments of a "critical philosophy" (in the Kantian sense), with a list of categories.4 These truths are the joint discovery of Socrates and his interlocutors; but the guiding is wholly in the hands of So- crates, who assumes responsibility for the sensible words that he attributes to Protagoras, and who even gives impartial criticism to his own argument.5 That he does not more definitely state the conclusions of the dialogue, and leaves the whole matter in so non-committal a fashion, is altogether in the spirit of Plato, as well as of his master; it is the return to a non-dogmatic style that is highly appropriate in dealing with a question that could not in Plato's day be more than thrown into relief by the refutation of false notions and the statement of certain requirements for a correct solution.

The point is illuminated by one of the long digressions of Socrates, which, as Theodorus remarks, is easier to follow than the argument itself.1 It deals with the difference between the lawyer, who is a slave to the necessities of his profession, and the philosopher, whose liberal profession excuses him from the instancy of practical affairs; all time is at his command: 'the argument is our servant and must wait our leisure.'2 Plato must not be pressed for too dogmatic a deliverance on the matter in hand.3 The whole method of Plato, in this as well as in other dialogues, especially when taken in the light of the digression on the philosopher, suggests that the Socrates of the Theaetetus is ironical in his inconclusiveness. The audience, at least, is not a little wiser than before. The Parmenides has always been a stumbling-block for its readers. Plato attacking the doctrine of ideas ? The notion seems absurd. But there is no evading the fact; the only question is, what form of the doctrine is it that is so easily demolished ? And who is the young Socrates, its unsuccessful champion ? That the doctrine is not what Plato himself had previously held, is apparent: it is clearly such a 1 Theaetetus, 177c. 2 Ibid., 173bc. 3 The contrast rests on the same reasoning as the defense of the philosopher against the charge of uselessness in Rep., 487 ff. and in Rep., 516e ff.; and is based on the distinction between the ideal and the physical world. Humor plays about the whole digression, but the philosopher has much the best of it. One phase in the caricature of the philosopher should be noted. The philosopher does not care to join in the ordinary occupations of men; he is' measuring earth and heaven and the things which are under and on the earth and above heaven, interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their entirety, but not condescending to anything which is at hand ' (Theaetetus, I73e.). And the jest about the blindness of the star-gazer Thales is applicable to all philosophers; for the philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbor, but is occupied in searching into the essence of man (ibid., I74ab). It is clear that Plato intends the phrase about the astronomical activities of the philosopher to be taken chiefly in a metaphorical sense (cf. Rep., 529a: Socrates ridicules Glaucon for sentimentalizing about the elevating influence of astronomy); for when he generalizes about ' all philosophers ' he mentions speci- fically investigations of human problems, rather than cosmology. Aristophanes wilfully treats metaphor as fact, since dramatic effect is to be gained (Theaetetus, I73e; cf. Apology, i8b. It is even easier to raise a laugh by an appeal to the eyes than by an appeal to the reason).</page><page sequence="49">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato III perversion of his theory as would not be found in an early stage of its development (in the mind of the real Socrates or of Plato), but in a later stage when Plato's makeshift language had been carelessly used by others. In fact, the young Socrates gives the version of the doctrine that Aristotle undertakes to criticize in the Metaphysics; " and if we could suppose that Plato had his young pupil Aristotle in mind when he invented the part of the 'young Socrates' in the Parmenides, we should find ourselves assisting at a very entertaining comedy. We should have Aristotle defending unsuccessfully his own erroneous view of the Platonic Doctrine of Ideas!"I There are difficulties, as the author of the sentences just quoted admits, to prevent us from believing that Plato had the young Aristotle especially in mind; but it is obvious that he is criticizing such a perversion of his own theory as was likely to crop up in the Academy. He finds Parmenides a con- venient mouth-piece for his own answers to the perverted statement of his doctrine; and since Socrates has been habitually used to voice his own statement of the theory, the natural way to bring the two views together is to make Socrates talk with Parmenides; and there is no chronological difficulty in imagining a meeting. But in order to bring it to pass, Plato has to make his master Socrates young again, and to send him to school again to learn from Plato himself. This is indeed "a very entertaining comedy"! Of course the use of Parmenides to present his own criticisms saves Plato from such open discourtesy as would have attended an attack delivered in his own person.2 Since the perverted theory could easily be developed from the notions of the real Socrates, it was logically defensible to put it in the mouth of the young Socrates.3 Thus "the mise en scene and cast of the dialogue 1 J. A. Stewart, Plato's Doctrine of Ideas, p. 72. 2 The device reminds one of the irony of Socrates in the Symposium, where he criticized the views of his host and his fellow guests by recounting the discourse of Diotima. 3 Burnet naturally is shocked by such a suggestion: "That Plato should have meant his own earlier self will only be credible to those who can believe that in the Phaedo he made use of Socrates as a mask for his own personality; while the view that by Socrates here he meant some callow Academician who held his own theory in a crude form should be credible to no one.

But we are not yet done with the comedy. Parmenides does not represent the whole truth till he has been submitted to criticism. The second part of the dialogue, therefore, with its bewildering dialectic, is aimed at the Eleatics as much as at the Academicians, even though it is Par- menides who is Plato's spokesman.2 The One of the Eleatic philosophy has no content, and can explain experience only as it resolves itself into a Many. The argument is exceedingly abstract, and is not alto- gether guiltless of fallacies;3 of these some are probably unintentional, but others may be intended as incidental satire on the Megaric dialectic. The hero of the dialogue is Plato, who does not speak a word in his own person, but who pulls the strings with consummate cleverness. He does not repudiate the doctrine of ideas: he rejects the more gross perversions of it. He by no means gives up his dependence on the reason; he shows that the reason is valid only when it has a content.4 master." Thales to Plato, p. 256. Yet a few pages later we read: "Parmenides proves that, if we take the intelligible world by itself, it is quite as unsatisfactory as the sensible, and by taking the One as his example, he really refutes the Megaric doctrine, and that with the weapon of the Megarics themselves. It adds to the humour of the situation that this refutation is ruthlessly carried out by the revered Parmenides." Ibid., p. 262. If the "revered Parmenides" may be represented in such an occupation, why is Socrates too respectable to assist in the comedy ? I Stewart, Plato's Doctrine of Ideas, p. 72 f. 2 This appears to be in the main the view of Jowett, Taylor, Natorp, and Stewart. Cf. Stewart, pp. 79 if- 3 Noted by Jowett, tr. Plato, IV, pp. 33 f. 4 P. E. More, whose analysis of the Parmenides is in many ways illuminating, seems to me to miss the point here, because of his dualistic bias. He holds that the second part of the Parmenides "exhibits the inadequacy of the metaphysical use of reason to prove or disprove what we possess by the higher intuition " (Platonism, p. 304): and since he perceives that Parmenides is correct in his attack on the ideas, which are nevertheless not given up, he argues that they must rest on a non-rational basis, and "do not come to us by a process of metaphysical logic, but by means of some direct experience independent of such logic." Is not More reversing the order in which Plato conceived the matter, and does not faith and contemplation end the work that reason leaves undone? Stewart's guidance in this fundamental matter seems to me more safe. As an alternative to More's dualistic interpretation of Plato, I suggest some such account of Plato's metaphysical career as the following:</page><page sequence="51">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 113 The Sophist has less of dramatic interest than any of the preceding dialogues; instead of the iridescent lights that usually play about Plato's theme, we find the white light of reason. Socrates is only in the background; he launches the discussion at the beginning, but is quite eclipsed by the Eleatic Stranger, who obviously speaks for Plato. The pretense of a dramatic method is so awkwardly sustained that the Eleatic Stranger professes to be familiar with the difference be- tween a sophist and a philosopher; but of course he was not present in the dialogue to which Plato evidently refers. The spirit of the present dialogue is fairly represented by the figure of the hunt for game, which is revived from the Phaedo and the Republic; but it is not an altogether disinterested hunt, for the way in which damaging examples under a series of dichotomies are manipulated reminds us of the method of the tenth book of the Republic, in which the relation of original and imitation was manipulated for the express purpose of depreciating the artist. The logical method of the Sophist, too, the method of repeated divisions, is not really adequate as a general principle of research: Plato indeed takes the pains elsewhere to make the point clear.1 Yet Plato introduces the method here not without a comic purpose; for it was a favorite method of the eristic sophists, especially of the Megarics of his own day, and they are therefore neatly hoist with their own petard. The sophist, now no longer an individual, like the respectable Protagoras, but the type of the unenlightened charlatan, the antithesis of the philosopher, is a fair target for bitter attack. The Eleatic Stranger, who realizes that the problem involves an investigation of the meaning of 'not-being', criticizes in turn all the schools of philosophy: the old masters; 3 the materialists, who are engaged in a war of giants and gods, and who must be educated be- (i) Pupil of Cratylus: pluralism.

For the Eleatic Stranger has been forced to 'lay hands on father Parmenides'; if he is over-scrupu- lous, the argument must be abandoned.3 Burnet suggests that his "reluctance ... to differ from his master Parmenides with regard to his central doctrine (24id) is a hint of Plato's own attitude towards Socrates at this time."' Barring the qualification contained in the words "at this time," and the implication that Plato ever felt any par- ticular reluctance in dealing, freely with the Socratic teachings, the suggestion is helpful. Socrates is fast retiring to honorable obscurity. Plato confesses that he really can no longer keep up the pretence that he is only the mouth-piece of Socrates. Bits of the Socratic method persist; but the method, as it appears in the Parmenides and the Sophist, is too clumsy for the successful promulgation of new doctrine, except when carefully manipulated in the interest of comedy. Dramatic fitness is even less regarded in the Politicus than in the preceding dialogues. The Eleatic Stranger shows by his allusions to Attic history that he is only an Athenian masquerading as an Eleatic.5 The comedy of the dialogue, too, is perfunctory and in the main ex- ternal to the plot; there are jests, but there is little humor. The sub- ject, to be sure, lends itself to satire; but Plato's mood is earnest and too bitter for such playful comedy as we find, for example, in the Re- public. The point of view of the Eleatic Stranger is absolutely de- tached and uncompromising; one might as well, he holds, divide the world into cranes and not-cranes as into Hellenes and barbarians. 1 Sophist, 246; cf. the treatment of Protagoras in the Theaetetus; it is the implica- tions of a philosophy, not merely the current statement of it, that interest Plato. The principle holds, too, of his interest in the teachings of Socrates. Even Parmen- ides has to develop his own system to admit difference and change. 2 Ibid., 248a ff. Clearly these are such over-zealous friends of the ideas as Plato depicts in the Parmenides under the guise of the young Socrates. Cf. Stewart, Plato's Doctrine of Ideas, p. 87, n. 2. 3 Sophist, 241C-242a. 4 Burnet, Thales to Plato, p. 274. 6 Politicus, 290e; 298.</page><page sequence="53">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato I15 This method of dichotomy, arbitrarily used, brings the king into the same category with the bird-catcher.1 The false politician, of Protean shape, now lion, now centaur or satyr, and a most accomplished wizard, is the chief of sophists and the most complete contrast to the true ideal of a statesman. That is the cue, of course, for such ridicule as we have seen Plato habitually heap on contemporary conditions, when he con- trasts them with the ideal world; but here his grim mood leads him for the moment to think of the golden age as in the past. When the argu- ment has shown that the name of sophist is rightly fixed on the poli- ticians, the 'satyric drama has been played out';2 and all that re- mains is to bow these satyrs and centaurs off the stage with rather less courtesy than the poets received in the Republic, and to discuss the 'royal science' in a sort of epilogue. The Philebus deals with a truly Socratic subject, though in a meta- physical vein that the historic Socrates could not have encompassed. Socrates leads the discussion; but little of his character remains,3 de- spite occasional bits of irony,4 and the fear of his fellow enquirers that he may leave them in the lurch, so that the discussion may end in a general bewilderment.5 The dialogue seems to have been written as a refutation of the heresy of Eudoxus, one of Plato's associates in the Academy; 6 and the tone is positive in its brushing away of conflicting dogmas, though Plato does not pretend that he has exhausted the sub- ject. So, for example, Socrates is content to leave that threadbare discussion about the One and the Many to the Cynics and the Eristics; it is a familiar puzzle that young men in their first infatuation for philosophy practise on their parents and even on their pet animals.7 Plato recognizes well enough, as we have seen, the principles on which division should be practised (cf. p. 113, n. i): the strictures of the Stranger on the younger Socrates for dividing too rapidly are just, as general criticism, but in the particular case (Politicus, 262a) the younger Socrates is quite correct, and the longer process substituted by the Stranger is a piece of trifling intended merely to discredit the type of the statesman. 2 Ibid., 303c. 3 Yet the awe that Socrates affects about the gods' names has a close parallel in the motive of the palinode in the Symposium. 4 E.g., his attribution of his ideas to former discussions, which he heard whether awake or in a dream: Philebus, 20ob; cf. 25bc. 5 Ibid., Ige f. 6 Cf. also p.

For it is the argument itself that has been the avowed antagonist of Socrates; 5 and however dogmatic Plato may be with regard to his main position, he does not exaggerate his achievement. Plato nowhere more explicitly gives his own theory of comedy than in the Philebus." It is based on an appreciation of the nature of the ridiculous as the condition most at odds with the Delphic inscrip- tion enjoining self-knowledge. Self-deception, whether about one's wealth, or about one's personal appearance or about one's wisdom and virtue, is the essence of comedy. But the ridiculous gives rise to a mixed emotion into which pleasure and pain both enter; and the pain is the greater as the self-deception occurs in the case not of harmless but of powerful persons. The theory is well illustrated in Plato's own writings. So long as the individual sophist or statesman or artist merely betrayed a slight lapse from truth, he was mildly satirized; but the more Plato realized how great is the gap that divides the typi- 1 Philebus, 62c. 2 Ibid., 2ic; cf. the contempt of Glaucon for the 'city of pigs,' Rep., 372d. 3 Philebus, Ilab. * Ibid., 67ab. 6 Pleasure, in fighting for the palm, has been smitten by the argument, and is laid low; and Socrates in taking up the cause of mind, which is struggling for the place above pleasure and second only to the good, has to forge new weapons, - namely, a metaphysical system of classification. Cf. 4Ib: Socrates proposes to Protarchus that they approach and grasp the new argument like wrestlers. But the argument proves to be merely a sparring partner for Socrates; it even speaks in his behalf, 5oa; 51c. The modesty of the closing sentence is thus the more remarkable. 6 Ibid., 48-50.</page><page sequence="55">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 117 cal sophist and his fellows from the true philosopher, and how potent is the sophist to prevent philosophy from guiding the state, the more bitter was Plato's attack on the whole army of deceivers. VI Toward the end of Plato's life, he yielded again to the temptation to imagine his ideals realized in concrete moulds. The Timaeus is the result. Plato represents Socrates as desirous of seeing his state in motion or in conflict, in the world of growth and decay.' Of course the discussion is not really about the state that Socrates has been sup- posed to found, but about Platonic metaphysics in its relation to phys- ics. Whether or not the historical Socrates was ever seriously in- terested in physical speculations, there is no doubt that in the years of his maturity he had renounced whatever speculations of this kind he had ever entertained. It would be an idle pretense to carry on the present discussion principally through the mouth of Socrates; by giving the stage to the Pythagorean, Timaeus, Plato at once avoids such an absurdity and disclaims personal responsibility for the views that are to be expressed. "We are led by Plato himself to regard the Timaeus, not as the centre or inmost shrine of the edifice, but as a detached building in a different style, founded, not after the Socratic, but after some Pythagorean model."'2 How far Plato supposed the Pythagorean accounts to be convincing, or how far he attempted in the manner of the eclectic to appropriate truth from them, is a question incapable of exact solution. But it is probable that any solution will fail that does not reckon with certain evasions on the part of Plato. In the first place, Plato is dealing with a subject that is by its very nature incapable of absolute certainty: 3 that is sound Platonic doctrine, entirely in accord with all that Plato has said elsewhere. But his more important scruple is one of interest: how seriously does he take any attempt to deal with the particulars of the world of sense? The greater part of the Timaeus appears to be a perfunctory attempt to fill a gap in Plato's system which does not greatly interest him, and which he treats in the same semi-mythical, semi-humorous spirit in 1 Timaeus, 19b. 2 Jowett, tr., Plato, III, p. 345. 3 Timaeus, 29bc.</page><page sequence="56">118 William Chase Greene which he discusses the 'perfect number' and the 'tyrant's number.' A greater earnestness and positiveness appear as soon as the theo- logical aspects of the question are considered. In the Timaeus all explanations are referred to teleological grounds; Plato is a good enough Socratic to wish to know that all things are ordered for the best. That was the object of the reputed interest of Socrates in sci- ence; but science failed to satisfy this requirement.' Now that Plato sets forth an account of what is for the best, he speaks not through Socrates but through Timaeus. The reason is not obscure. Not be- cause the investigations of the Pythagoreans themselves hold the truth, but because Plato's own investigations in the dialectical dia- logues have given him a vantage ground, he finds himself in a position from which he may condescend to put in mythical form the answer to the reputed questions of Socrates.2 By using Timaeus as a mouth- piece he avoids responsibility for statements in dealing with a field which is avowedly the province of uncertainty, and which the Pytha- goreans have in a sense made their own. Of course Plato is not wholly trifling in the Timaeus; yet he is only doing his best, with imperfect and borrowed instruments of thought, to deal with a subject that is, he thinks, in itself incapable of exact treatment, and that at best is for him of only relative importance. He attaches no exaggerated de- gree of veracity to the result: Timaeus prays that his words may endure 'in so far as they may have been spoken rightly.'3 As Aristotle is the unconscious butt of the Parmenides, hosts of readers, ancient, mediae- val, and modern, have been taken in by the Timaeus; Aristotle did not realize that Plato had anticipated all that could be said against the theory of ideas; the readers of the Timaeus have not realized that Plato was fully aware that elements of a sound metaphysic and conjectures 1 Phaedo, 97c ff. 2 The imperfect relation between the Tintaeus and the Republic is thus explained. The Timaeus professes to be a continuation of the Republic, though the characters are different, the subject of the Republic is only partially stated, and the summary of the Republic in the Timaeus is incomplete. From this incompleteness it is not necessary to conclude that Plato is either referring to an earlier form of the Republic or contemplating a new edition of it: he merely intends to make no use in the Timaeus of the metaphysics of the Republic, since it has been further developed in the dialectical dialogues. 3 Critias, io6a.</page><page sequence="57">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato I19 about the natural world (which often have been proved strangely near the truth) were mingled with poetry and absurd dogma. A tour de force like the Timaeus must be warily approached. Like all myth, it defies the sort of analysis that insists on drawing a clear line between fact and fiction, between sober truth and whimsical inventiveness. The legend of Atlantis is probably the fiction of Plato himself; whether he speaks by the voice of Socrates or of Timaeus, he 'can easily in- vent Egyptian or any other tales.' The legend abounds in circum- stantial detail; and Socrates remarks gravely that the fact that the tale is no invention but a true narrative is greatly in its favor.2 Again, due allowances being made, the account of the creation of the universal animal in the Timaeus bears a relation to Pythagorean mathematics and astronomy similar to that borne by the Aristophanic myth in the Symposium to current mythology. Much of the detail elsewhere is offered in a spirit of mock seriousness. Altogether, the serious con- tributions of the Timaeus, which are many, would gain in philosophical value by being disentangled from the hazardous conjectures that ac- company them; but the task of extricating the serious contributions is both delicate and impossible to accomplish completely. And, after all, to many it will seem better to enjoy the melange of philosophy and comedy, with the assurance that Plato himself was far from wishing to say definitely where truth ended and the borderland of comedy began. Nothing need be added to the remarks of Jowett3 to show that the Critias is one of Plato's 'noble lies,' carried out with a mixture of pure imagination and verisimilitude. It is typical of his myths, in that it embodies truth in the form of fiction. The theme is more difficult than that of the Timaeus; for it deals with men, not with un- known gods, and a greater degree of correctness is to be expected in a picture of human than of divine things. The speaker therefore craves indulgence.4 Perhaps we may fairly argue from this that Plato's claims for truth in parts of the Timaeus are modest; and possibly the reason for the incompleteness of the Critias is nothing more than the difficulty of the theme. 1 Phaedrus, 275b. 2 Timaeus, 26e, cf. the irony in 40d ff. 3 Tr. Plato, III, pp. 524 f. 4 Critias, io6c ff.</page><page sequence="58">120 William Chase Greene The spirit of the Laws is not unlike that of the Timaeus. The philos- opher who has contemplated the intensity of reality again imagines himself to return to the illusory world of human vicissitudes, and again the return is reluctant. Metaphysics, or its sister, religion, is the occupation worthy of ardent pursuit, and there is something trivial, if not actually ridiculous, in mundane cares. 'Human affairs are hardly worthy of serious consideration, and yet we must consider them seriously, - such is our ill luck. . . . To serious matters man should give serious consideration; to a matter which is not serious he should not give it; and God is by nature worthy of our most serious and blessed veneration, but man . . . has been created to be the plaything of God, and this indeed is the best part of his nature.' 1 The Athenian, therefore, like a shipwright laying down the lines of a ship, tries 'to distinguish the designs of life, and to lay down their keels according to the characters of men's souls.'2 A double point is in Plato's mind: the insignificance of man, which may be a fit subject for either tragic or comic treatment, and the grim necessity of making something of human life. The ambiguity appears in the words of the Athenian: he refers to the whole discussion as 'our old man's sober game,'3 or as the 'old men's rational pastime':4 Cleinias, a little puzzled, interposes, 'You mean, I suppose, their serious and noble pursuit.' And the Athenian, dismissing the subject with the answer, 'Perhaps,' goes on to another matter. This ambiguity of motive, together with Plato's waning literary powers, accounts sufficiently for the comparative absence of comedy in the Laws. Humorous figures of speech and vivid dramatic scenes are rare;5 but a dry humor is at times not absent. The dissertations on the three kinds of funeral 6 and the two types of doctor,' and the account of the early life of children (who wail and shout continually for the first three years of life)8 show an observation of life that is one of the strongest assets of " Laws, 803bc; cf. 804b. 2 Ibid., 803a. The eyes of the Athenian are fixed on human nature, rather than on the world of ideas, though the ideas are not discarded (cf. 965bc.). That is the justification for such comedy as exists in the Laws; yet the tone is in the main solemn, and the speakers are ' tragic poets ' (8i7b). 3 Ibid., 685a. 4 Ibid., 769a. 5 Cf. Jowett, tr. Plato, V, pp. xix f. 6 Laws, 719d. 7 Ibid., 720. 8 Ibid., 792a.</page><page sequence="59">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 12 the Laws. But of the brilliant comedy that in the earlier dialogues constantly arose from the interplay of minds, there is nothing. The Laws dogmatizes: and the Athenian dominates the dialogue. If 'the argument ' formerly was the personified hero, now it is the servant of the chief speaker. 'The argument, like an animal, ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not allowed to take the bit in his mouth, so that we may not, as the proverb says, fall off our ass.' The reasoning of the Laws sits firmly in the saddle; but its solidity is bought at the expense of resiliency. VII Enough has been said, I trust, to show that Plato was on the whole a laughing rather than a weeping philosopher. The epithet must be understood, to be sure, in no trivial sense; for Plato is no easy op- timist, and no idle jester. It is, however, with confidence that we may claim for him a place among the world's great comic writers, - Aristophanes, Juvenal, Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare, and Mere- dith', - who have known how to hold something very sacred, and to express it perhaps most often by methods of indirection. Plato's works are the personification of philosophy in the spirit of comedy; and their special merit as literature lies in a persuasiveness far exceed- ing their purely logical appeal. The secret of this persuasiveness is not infrequently to be found in their comic garb. The results of the present study are of two kinds. We have seen that there is more comedy and satire in the Platonic dialogues than most readers have generally recognized, and that they may often be best understood as philosophical mimes. On this side, it is helpful to recall Plato's own definition of comedy as the exposure of all preten- sion;2 so far the comedy is negative, but the setting of limits is in itself 1 Meredith's theory of comedy and his practice are alike Platonic; curiously enough, he does not mention Plato in The Idea of Comedy. Especially noteworthy is the spirit of detachment in which he professes to view his characters; it reminds one of the personified argument stalking in the background of Plato's dialogues. Think of the argument offered 76 6' 7rproV 'OXV/A7LKS r _ TACOTipil r Kal r 'OXVIArl7y Ati (Rep., 583b); or of the three waves in the Republic; and the sentence, d propos of the matrimonial prospects of the second of the three Harrington sisters, ' Then Joy clapped hands a second time, and Horror deepened its shadows' (Evan Har- rington, p. I8). 2 Philebus, 48-50. Cf. p. Ix6.</page><page sequence="60">122 William Chase Greene an achievement, and prepares the way for further achievements. A readiness to believe that Plato is not averse to jesting, or at least to mingling jests with serious thoughts, will save many a blunder.' We must be ready, on the other hand, to discern in the midst of Plato's comedy a more serious motive than has sometimes been admitted. We must not be deceived by the apparent inconclusiveness of a dia- logue or by the satirical vein of a discussion; a real conclusion or a kernel of truth often lies behind the mystification. At the root of the matter is Plato's sincere conviction that truth is, humanly speaking, only approximately to be attained, and that the personal element in the quest prevents, for better and for worse, any final reduction of truth to a formula. Hence dialectic, with its turns and oblique vistas and its indeterminateness, is the chosen method for communicating such truth as transpires; and comedy is the natural outcome of Plato's use of such a wayward literary instrument as the dialogue in the ser- vice of so stern a master as absolute truth. The remarks of Pater on this point throw light on Platonic comedy.2 "What Plato presents to his readers is . . . a paradox, or a reconciliation of two opposed tend- encies: on one side, the largest possible demand for infallible certainty in knowledge, . . yet, on the other side, the utmost possible inexact- ness, or contingency, in the method by which actually he proposes to attain it. . . . The humour of Socrates . . . was welcome as afford- ing a means of escape from the full responsibilities of his [Plato'sl teaching. It belonged, in truth, to the tentative character of dialectic, of question and answer as the method of discovery, of teaching and learning, to the position, in a word, of the philosophic essayist . The irony, the Socratic humor, so serviceable to a diffident teacher, are, in fact, Plato's own." Again, with due caution, a gradual progression in Plato's adventures in comedy may be detected. At first we found him chronicling with great freedom the method and the partial results of Socrates. Next we saw him proceed, in the spirit of comedy, to use the dialectic method 1 Cf., for example, the absurdity of J. Wagner, noted by Adam, ed. Euthyphro, p. xxvii; Socrates is represented as saying that he is so eager to speak that he would gladly pay to have auditors; Wagner objects that Socrates had no money! The often repeated fallacy that Plato condemned poetry is another instance. 2 Plato and Platonism, pp. 156 ff.; esp. p. 169.</page><page sequence="61">The Spirit of Comedy in Plato 123 to get rid of obstacles and to throw problems into relief, having his own conclusions in mind in each dialogue, though not fully aware, of course, of the conclusions that he was to reach later. Then in the golden dialogues of his prime, we noticed how he evoked so vivid an ideal world that he was able to assume it as present, and contrasted with it in a comic spirit the paltry 'facts' of this imperfect world. And, finally, in the last great dialogues in which Plato endeavored to bring ideals and facts together, we looked for comedy almost in vain; it proved to be incidental. Dangerous in the extreme it would be to rely overmuch on the pres- ence of comedy in Plato; and the temptation so to err is the stronger because of the frequent inconsistencies in his writings. It would be so easy to treat as mere jest all that does not square with an arbitrary notion of Plato's thought. The more arduous course is to realize that much has been written irat&amp;as XapLP, but that not Plato himself would have always cared, or dared, to say just how much is in earnest, and how much is comedy.</page></plain_text>
