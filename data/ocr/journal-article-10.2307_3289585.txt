<plain_text><page sequence="1">H. J. RosE, A Handbook of Greek Mythology: New York, E. P. Dutton and Company (1928). Pp. 363. $4.50. Three classes of readers were in the author's mind as he pre- pared this manual: the general reader who is interested in an out- line knowledge of the subject, the student who seeks to delve into some one phase of mythology, and the more ambitious student who is ready to undertake an investigation in a particular field of research, for whose benefit have been inserted numerous notes with reliable references to the leading authorities. The compression of the material within less than four hundred pages indicates the self-restraint that has been exercised. The wisdom of the author's selection of subject-matter must rest with the individual reader. In the introductory chapter there is a brief examination and criticism of methods employed by previous investigators, leading to the conclusion that today we must employ the best modern</page><page sequence="2">608 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL methods of investigation in the study of myths. There are three types: (1) the myth proper; (2) the saga, such as Homer found in the case of the Iliad; and (3) the Miirchen, the story pure and simple. In the second chapter, "The Beginning of Things," the author draws heavily on the earliest literary sources, Homer and Hesiod. The third and fourth chapters have to do with the chil- dren of Cronus. It is Professor Rose's opinion that the sea-myth- ology of the Greeks was either adopted by them or acquired after their entrance by land into the country occupied by them in his- torical times, the Balkan peninsula. The interesting suggestion is made in the next chapter on the "Queens of Heaven" that the tales of Hera's quarrels with Zeus reflect actual breaches in friendly relations between the Greek and non-Greek sections of their worshippers. It is further suggested that the familiar story "Let the fairest take it" is part of the epic machinery of the Cy- pria, which presupposes the Iliad and Odyssey. It is sheer inven- tion on the part of the author of the Cypria. Hera represents roy- alty, Athena conquest, Aphrodite love incarnate. This is a rever- sion to folk-lore, to the old problem, "which good thing is best ?" All threeof the bribes offered were highly esteemed by the Greeks generally. The varied roles of Athena and Artemis are amply depicted. Chapters vi and vii have to do, the one with the newer gods Apollo, Hermes, and Dionysus, the other with such less out- standing figures as Hephaestus, Cybele, the Nymphs, and the Muses. The lover of literature will pause now and then as he reads the descriptions of the greater divinities, and will not fail to see the author at his best. Not a little of the rich material of this im- portant chapter is traceable to Euripides in particular of the tragic trio. In concluding his treatment of gods, both great and small, the author observes that practically every god is connected in some way with at least one animal. After freely illustrating this point, he pays this indirect tribute to Greek anthropomorphism, that, in general, people who worship divine beasts are in a lower state of culture than those whose deities have human form. Passing in the eighth chapter to the "Cycles of Saga," Mr. Rose treats first those that are famous regardless of locality, re-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 609 serving a special section for Troy, and incorporates in the ninth chapter such other stories as appear to him worthy of mention. The fact is noted that the various cycles of saga are closely asso- ciated with Minoan-Mycenaean sites. One is led to the conviction that with the progress of research much more of our current mythology than we realize at present will be found to have his- torical basis as new light is shed on the pre-Hellenic period. Pasi- phae, well known to mythologists, may well be a lunar goddess who was worshipped in Laconia. Cadmus, we are told, taught the Thebans to write. The Greek alphabet is a modification of the Phoenician script. The Troy saga will make a special appeal in view of the awakening interest in the approaching bimillennium Vergilianum. Paris appears in the r6le of war-leader at Troy. He had won his spurs and acquired his new name of Alexander. While still a shepherd he had won the love of Oenone, a nymph to whom he played false. The author distinguishes between the actual campaign against Troy and Homer's version by remark- ing (p. 241) that even in the saga the Greeks were never able to cut the Trojan communications with their numerous Thracian and Asiatic allies, and that Homer had handled the details with the freedom of a great creative poet. Once more it is a problem of omission. The Wooden Horse may be a confused reminiscence of some Oriental siege-engine. The Orpheus-Eurydice myth is by no means Greek save by adoption. The Lapiths and Centaurs were real people living in Thessaly. Aegeus is a localized Poseidon. The close parallel between the career of his son, Theseus, and that of Heracles is ascribed to deliberate imitation on the part of Attic saga-men of the better-known tale. Those who love a story will find a rich soil in the tenth chapter, "Mdrchen in Greece and Italy." The gods in Greece often play the same part as the fairies have done in the tales of modern Europe. Jack and the Beanstalk is probably a degenerate descend- ant of a Greek archetype. So with many others. The concluding chapter, bearing out the sub-title, "Including its Extension to Rome," is entitled "Italian Pseudo-Mythology." One or two of</page><page sequence="4">610 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL the stories about Hercules may be native, such as the fight between Hercules and Cacus. In general the reviewer feels that this new contribution to our mythological bibliography will fill a distinct place. A real and substantial service has been done to the cause of sound scholar- ship. The style holds the reader's interest throughout. The two Indexes are carefully compiled, and the attention to correct quan- tities enhances the value of the book for purpose of reference. When one considers the magnitude of the undertaking, he will be impressed with the reliability of the references in general, and the relatively small number of inaccuracies. ALFRED W.
