Hebrew University Jerusalem. I am grateful to Orly Goldwasser for many fruitful conversations, in which many of the ideas presented here were developed. I would like also to thank Eitan Grossman for his impor tant suggestions and his comments on the English. A full discussion of the words and their occurrences will appear in a future article. I use here the term 'classifier' as defined by Goldwasser in her series of articles and books (Goldwasser 2002; 2005 and forthc.), rather than determinative. Early on, Polotsky remarked in his publication of the stela of Heka-Yeb: «j "appearing as such with certain words of evil meaning in some texts of the First Inter mediate Period and the Early Middle Kingdom." He also mentions the examples from Hatnub and from the Letter to the Dead; see Polotsky 1930:198. McDonald 2007. Te Velde 1977: 22-26. A preliminary list of Sethian words was collected by Zandee already in his article in 1963, which enumerates the words nSn, hnnw, krj, sh3, 6 swhi, and khb; Zandee saw the metaphorical-cognitive meaning of this category, saying: "Solche Gedanken wurden also mit Seth assoziiert," cf. Zandee 1963: 147. McDonald 2007: 32. McDonald differentiates between the deity form of the god Seth á , and its animal forms: , "fe/ For central members and fuzzy edges, see Goldwasser 2002: 27-29. nbwty, nbwy, ntrwy, Rhwy, and Sth which McDonald adds to the list are all epithets of the god Seth, and therefore do not stand in the center of our discussion. The case of brl will be discussed below. In other cases words which are included in the list may find their place there because of strong similarity of signs in Hieratic, such are the sign of the donkey (ri and htrw): Donkey: «a, (Vogelsang &amp; Gardiner 1908: R.64) Seth:^fi&gt;, (Möller 1,13; no. 144). Other similar cases are ikrw (see McDonald 2007: 36, note a), and probably also the Giraffe (sr, cf. McDonald 2007: 36, note p, and mmi, see Goldwasser, forthc.).</page><page sequence="2">16 NivAllon nSnj, 'storm, rage' s$n, 'storm'* 9 jsd, 'dribble, saliva'' rw /WWW\ /~ ill —I/if .. nn w .

McDonald dates the occurrences of the word jh in the pEdwin Smith with the Sethian classifier to the Old Kingdom as "it is generally acknowledged that P.

Related to this myth, Baal was apparently also con sidered as god of the seamen (mainly in his title Baal-Sapan). A temple for him was held in the har bor of Pera-nefer,40 in the 18th Dynasty. The identification between Baal and Seth was so successful not only because of the latter's role as the god of the foreign lands,41 but also through his storm-god characteristics, which are common to both gods.42 The depth of this syncretism is indicated by the fact that most of the attestations of the name Baal in Egyptian texts are classified with the Seth sign.43 But it wasn't just Baal who was identified with Seth, but also Seth was identified with Baal, in a clear case of cultural appropriation,44 or an enrichment of the Seth concept as Te Velde describes it: "It would seem that the foreign god Baal, who is regarded as manifestation of Seth because the latter is the lord of foreign countries, is now enriching the Egyptian concept of Seth with a new function".45 A stimulating example of the effect this inter cultural limture46 had on Seth can be seen in a lia;- ... „ „ , , „ , 6 6 Fig. 3 Seth on the 400-Year Stela ure of Seth from the 400-Year Stela (Fig. 3). 7 In (after Montet 1933, pi.
