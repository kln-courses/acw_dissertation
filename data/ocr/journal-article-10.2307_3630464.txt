<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (Formerly Southwestern Journal of Anthropology) VOLUME 43 * NUMBER 1 * SPRING * 1987 ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION Tord Larsen Department of Social Anthropology, University of Bergen, Norway Cultural translation is contingent on one's capacity for self-criticism, and this paper traces its development in Western society: the emergence of the individual, the concept of the creative act, and formal concepts of truth and justice. Admitting that some cultures have better tools for comparison and translation than others, the paper identifies a self-critical potential which must be present in all cultures to permit the imputation of responsibility and the creation of obligation. The argument is applied to such topics as the viability of metaphors, segmentary opposition, anthropologists' advocacy of Third and Fourth-World causes, and the nature of utopias. THE EXPRESSION "the struggle of the paradigms" suggests that when repre- sentatives of dissimilar paradigms meet, it is the most powerful, the slyest, the most rhetorically effective advocate who comes out the winner-the ar- gument of power and not the power of the argument makes the difference. This is a reasonable assumption, since paradigms in a sense are incommen- surable by definition. If we could get together with different paradigms and evaluate their strong and weak points, that would be a sign that we shared a superordinate paradigm from the outset. It seems, then, that the very definition of paradigms precludes the possibility of such a neutral vantage point "between" or "over" our systems of preconceptions.1 The incommensurability of paradigms became Kuhn's biggest headache-or at least that of his critics-when he employed the concept to characterize scientific styles of thought. For how can we conceive of scientific progress when each new paradigm carries with it internal criteria of what it means to "correspond to reality" and when there is no "inter-paradigmatic space" where we can stand and rank the paradigms according to their relative merits? The debate to which Kuhn (1962) gave rise became a version of the debate about anthropology's most important theoretical problem: the problem of trans- lation. This is both a new and an old problem. New in the sense that Peter Winch's work in the 1950s and 1960s (Winch 1958, 1964) put the so-called rationality debate into motion; old in the sense that it has been a chronic problem 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH in American cultural anthropology since Boas. Old also in the sense that it is rooted in the intellectual climate of Romanticism, which stressed the unique character of cultures and historical eras, in opposition to the Enlightenment idea of a universal Reason. To the Romantics, anthropology was a kind of comparative epistemology, a comparative study of diverse universes of meaning and, at the most, their social preconditions. A protagonist of this style of thinking was the father of nationalism, Johann Gottfried Herder, who emphasized the radical discontinu- ities between the culturally constructed worlds of different ideological com- munities (see Berlin 1976). Herder would no doubt have agreed with Boas, who thought that we cannot even speak about a rock without implicating the metaphysics inherent in our culturally specific categories and rules of inter- pretation. If our world is culturally constituted and if each culture has a unique character of its own, anthropology then becomes a hazardous enterprise. When anthro- pologists set about portraying these universes of meaning, they are caught in a quandary if they are called upon to justify the conceptual bridgeheads they have constructed in order to penetrate worlds of meaning which by their own theory are incommensurable with their own. A doctrine that turns men into God and creators of reality inevitably ends up with a Babel to contend with: when we produce the world of which we are the products, we have no guarantee that we share reality with other teams of production. We have already renounced the idea of a transcendental God and of a culturally neutral and immediately perceptible reality to which other think- ers have resorted when they wanted to explain how we can understand each other. "The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached, "Edward Sapir (1929:209) said long ago in his secular version of the story of Babel. Anthropologists claim to possess the tools that enable them to understand all the confused tongues of the world, but they have done a better job docu- menting the incomparability of the tongues than giving an account of their own multilingual competence. Rather, the theories of meaning which anthropologists subscribe to seem to subvert the very strategy they prescribe: understanding others on their own terms, by way of the concepts people use to define the practices they engage in. In monograph after monograph we read how the aboriginal world defies description in terms of Western concepts, and then we discover that the anthropologist uses the subsequent three hundred pages to perform the magic trick he said could not be done. The reader must either conclude that the alien universe in fact is describable in Western terms or resign himself to the fact that the author has fed him a number of fairy tales. Theories of meaning with a Romantic turn say that cultures are forms of understanding which limit the range of possible cognition and experience within a given culture. These forms of understanding or schemas of interpretation cannot themselves be the object of experience, but are rather like molds into</page><page sequence="3">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 3 which all experience is cast. The Azande notions of witchcraft and our me- chanical concept of causation exemplify fundamental modes of understanding which their exponents tacitly presuppose in every discussion about the nature of reality. People with such different modes of understanding will have problems throwing out rescue ropes to each other's anthropologists, and if we stick to the principle that we must grasp the internal concepts which define the point of the practices we observe-and we should stick to it-the prospects for a truly comparative anthropology seem rather bleak. As long as it is our schemas of interpretation which provide us with the premises for our apprehension of reality, it is difficult to imagine how these schemas themselves may be subject to reflection, criticism, and justification; from where would we requisition the concepts in which to couch this reflection? Just such a reflection and self-examination is required if we are to scale our horizons and acquire those of others. But how can we perform such intellectual gymnastics when our modes of understanding seem immune to criticism, when every critical effort becomes recodified in terms of the theory itself-a theory which recreates everything in its own image and wards off any experience which threatens to invalidate it? The theory, schema of interpretation, para- digm, or whatever acquires the logical status of a tautology, which is distin- guished precisely by the fact that it is irrefutable. If we cannot come up with arguments against (nor, by implication, in favor of) such immune, unfalsifiable, tautological edifices of thought, we cannot ex- amine them in other ways than by vacating them. When we do this, ideological change happens in the form of total gestalt shifts-by way of brainwashing, salvation, conversion (metaphors employed by Kuhn himself)-and not by means of argument against the edifice of thought we leave behind. Between the inhabitants of the old and the new world, there is no basis for argument, and the result is the state of affairs which is alluded to in the phrase the struggle of the paradigms. Of course, this is not the way scientific and ideological change occurs-and Kuhn would be the first to admit that-but some of his formulations do prepare the ground for such conclusions. If our schemas of interpretation (and cultures) were discontinuous ideologies impervious to outside penetration, it would be an illusion to think that we could study foreign cultures on their own premises; but this is the consequence that seems to follow from a number of theories of meaning. TWO STRATEGIES I shall try out a combination of two possible strategies to deal with the problem. Others have tried them before me, but they seem to choose one of them to the exclusion of the other. The first strategy is an attempt to identify some universal features of sig- nification and communication which enable us to transcend our given set of</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH conceptual premises. The model for this strategy has been supplied by linguists who argue that there are linguistic universals, properties that all languages must possess in order to function as means of communication. It is conceivable that we in an analogous manner can identify properties which all cultures "must" possess and which allow their bearers to reflect upon their own systems of preconceptions and to be receptive to those of others. Perhaps the very properties which render systems of meaning and action communicative at the same time make them, at least potentially, self-transcending. Those who have adopted this strategy seem to conclude that all cultures are equal in their capacity to examine themselves from the outside, as it were. Hence, they run into problems when they are asked to account for the undeniable differences between primitive, traditional, and modem societies on this score.2 Those who choose the other strategy-a historical/anthropological ap- proach-tend to believe that our society alone possesses the faculties of self- criticism and reflection, while primitive man is left standing there, unable to fathom his own as well as our cultural presuppositions. If we accept such a train of thought, the mission and destiny of our civilization becomes self-evident: to draw primitive man into history; only then is a dialogue possible between "them" and "us." I believe there is some truth to both these positions, and I shall try to point out a possible reconciliation between them by examining the concepts of morality and action. If we wish to approach the problem in a historical/anthropological fashion, we have to identify processes that exemplify paradigm-transcendence, trains of events that open closed universes of meaning and make them comparable and accessible to each other. We all know examples of processes that open the floodgates between closed domains: sphere integration makes "things" comparable and exchangeable; democracy and bureaucracy make corporate groups and moral communities accessible to each other by making men equal and capable of substitution; a universal church makes us equals in the eyes of God. Above all, science is the instrument of commensurability: it decontex- tualizes the world about us and fabricates abstract units, cleansed of subjective content, which we can describe in a universal language. Such processes are set in motion by metaphorical operations. Metaphors effect a mediation across existing semantic barriers, categories, and frames and perform the same kind of service as do transactions: while transactions integrate values (Barth 1966), metaphors mediate between elements drawn from dissimilar domains of meaning. In both cases the entrepreneur is the central figure: the economic entrepreneur paves the way for exchange across barriers of conversion (Barth 1972); the ideological innovator opens traffic between semantic domains. Since our history is mainly a story about the opening of such gates, it is a little harder to find examples of processes that go in the opposite direction. Ethnic incorporation is a possible candidate, as is the politization of discourse witnessed in many European countries in the seventies and the impressive work so-called "cognitive minorities" (Berger 1969) invest in the protection of</page><page sequence="5">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 5 their worlds. Here it is the border patrol-the brokers-rather than the en- trepreneurs, who have a major role to play, making sure that the fences are in good repair. In the following we shall concern ourselves with a process of mediation-the emergence of modern individualistic morality-and see what it carries with it. This innovation breaks down the partitions between status- specific moral codes and clears a new critical space for us where we can stand and evaluate our cultural premises in new ways. THE MODERN MORALITY I shall try to expand upon a contrast between a moral code which Peter Berger and his coauthors call "honor" and one they call "dignity" (Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1974). The honor code is associated with a rigidly hier- archical society, where each social stratum has its exclusive moral rules and status-specific criteria of moral excellence. A knight and a peasant each lives in his moral universe, and it is absurd to criticize the peasant for not living up to the knightly standards of morally acceptable conduct. What this amounts to is that we cannot possibly apply a moral yardstick to a person's actions until we have ascertained his social identity. An act which may be perfectly acceptable for a peasant to perform may be morally disqualifying for the knight. The peasant and the knight are therefore in a sense not morally accessible to each other; that is, an exchange of similar ethical demands or messages across this barrier amounts to patent absurdity, category mistakes, or whatever we want to call it-and herein lies the connection to our main concern. As long as the honor code is in force, the goal of one's moral enterprise- the criterion of morally acceptable actions-is to make one's acts correspond to explicit moral placards attached to the social status of the agent: we act in a morally unassailable fashion when we duplicate or repeat what J. K. Campbell calls "an archetypal behavior pattern" (quoted in Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1974:87). Once we can verify that an act complies with this pattern, the moral quality of the act and the moral worth of the agent are guaranteed; good deeds are literally true to form, imitative of a status-specific ethical prototype. What would a debate on ethical issues be like in such a society? It would pivot around the question of whether an act followed the paradigm of correct conduct, and once that was established, the debate would end. It does not make sense to put the standard, the paradigm, the moral placard itself under the magnifying glass, because the criterion of correct behavior is the corre- spondence between the act and the placard, which serves as the guarantor of moral rectitude. When the archetypal model is the yardstick by which all action is gauged, the model itself cannot be subjected to moral evaluation. (That would be just as absurd as asking whether the meter bar in Paris is really a meter. ) How do we proceed when we want to act virtuously within the honor code? Composing a sequence of actions under such circumstances seems to be similar to the way in which we put together sentences and other linguistic expressions;</page><page sequence="6">6 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH hence I would like to call this concept of action syntactical. When we speak, we obey the rules of grammar, and as long as we do that, we speak correctly. If you speak German and use prepositions like durch, fiir, and gegen, you are supposed to put the following part of speech in the accusative case. I would be at a loss to understand what you meant if you said that your conscience forbade you to employ the accusative and that, in order to preserve your integrity, you would use the dative case. If you speak German, use the ac- cusative case; if you play tic-tac-toe, then follow the rules; and if you are a knight, then go ahead and commit knightly acts. Criticizing the knight for following the code of conduct that comes with his status would be like blaming the player of tic-tac-toe for following the rules of the game; he is immune from criticism. Not only that, he has realized the Good in his world by behaving in such a rule-following manner; the Good is substantively defined and tied by definition to these rules of conduct. In my childhood I witnessed a moral code which was similar to the one we have described here. In the small company town where I grew up, you could hear expressions and phrases to the effect that it is "correct" that the manager at the plant votes conservative and the foreman "has a right" to vote liberal, while workers vote labor or communist. The way people expressed themselves showed that these were not empirical generalizations of the type "managers tend to vote conservative, workers tend to vote labor." Rather, their voting behavior was part of the description of their social statuses. In that case it does not make sense to chide the manager for voting conservative; that would be to criticize him for being what he is. In a way what we have here is a conflation of personal identity and social status: "In a world of honor, the individual discovers his true identity in his roles, and to turn away from the roles is to turn away from himself' (Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1974:90). To know one's place is to know one's self. With the introduction of modern morality, moral virtue is no longer guar- anteed by any external yardstick; from now on morality comes without a guarantee, and following the moral placards no longer assures the moral worth of actions. On the contrary, a blind loyalty to the code annuls the ethical element in action, because now all placards must be submitted to scrutiny. Now it is no longer morally acceptable to vote labor because one's father did, but voting is beyond reproach if it is the result of "mature deliberation" and "independent assessment." It is no longer legitimate to hold fashionable opinions simply because they are fashionable, since that would imply that opinions have been acquired without engaging the sovereign moral judge that the individual self has now become. Such a turn of the concept of morality relocates the touchstone of moral excellence from the external moral standard to somewhere inside one's self, to one's conscience. We have arrived at the event which has been termed "the invention of the individual." This creature has an identity in addition to the social identities it carries around with it and is thereby able to oppose them; actions no longer spring directly from social statuses. Knowing one's place is</page><page sequence="7">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 7 no longer knowing one's self, for now the masks threaten the authentic "I" which is to be found behind them all. "Let us discard the masks and get rid of all these inauthentic social games we are playing" is a constant refrain in the personal columns.3 The creation of such an entity which can oppose its social memberships ("the empty I," as some philosophers call it) is the reason we can meaningfully speak about human rights, which postulate a human identity defying distinctions of race, hierarchy, and nation. It also explains why we may practice civil disobedience without risking total ostracism, because the individual court of justice has a right and a duty to evaluate critically all decrees currently in force. The invention of the individual made the Nuremberg trials possible, trials which would have been inconceivable without the idea of an autonomous individual who can independently scrutinize the orders he is expected to obey. In my individual uniqueness-unique because I am "me" behind all masks- I am paradoxically similar and comparable to all other human beings, without regard to social distinctions: we are equally human, and therefore any other human being (even the "savage") can be at the receiving end of my moral messages. Now I can meaningfully criticize the manager of the plant for voting conservative, because he is a human being like myself, because he has a personal identity in addition to his identity as a manager; and this personal identity provides him with a vantage point from which he can evaluate his behavior. In other words, we have achieved a moral common market, an integration of moral spheres with the individual in the role as "general purpose medium." Just as money makes all "things" commensurable when economic spheres break down, the "general purpose identity" of the individual makes status-specific moral codes comparable. In addition, the goal of moral enterprise changes. Moral worth no longer resides in syntactical duplication of an explicit standard, but rather in a mode of action which is characterized by authentic choices. When I am something else and something more than the sum of my social identities, I am in a position to criticize the transmitted models of behavior that come with my social iden- tities. Not only am I able, but I am required, to scrutinize these standards, says modem morality. No longer do I have a "grammar" to follow when I act; now, all my acts are supposed to be authentic, self-fulfilling, and motivated by a personal commitment. My acts are supposed to be genuinely creative; they shall defy the existing state of affairs, repudiate all moral placards, and create something new. "After a genuine act, everything is changed," says Kojeve (in Descombes 1980:34). Of course, this does not mean that we cannot behave like most people do, but if we want our actions to be ethically worthy in the modem sense, we must not go passively along with the crowd. The most insistent spokesman for this modem morality was probably Kier- kegaard when he said that we do not live in the ethical realm when we justify our actions by referring to a rule of conduct, a behavior pattern, a moral placard. The philosophy which best expresses this modern ethic is, of course, exis- tentialism with its emphasis on the independent, individual choice. To us, the</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH autonomous individual is the sovereign source of all meaning and significance and the fount of all values; our heroes are heroes by virtue of their individual revolts against crushing institutions. All this amounts to the modern radical division between descriptive and normative statements (between "is" and "ought"). Statements like "he has acted according to the rules" and "he has acted well" are far from identical to us. The autonomy of morality has been established. The conception of an autonomous sphere of morals and the concomitant distinction between is-statements and ought-statements simply does not make sense in societies dominated by an honor code, MacIntyre (1966) and other historians of ethics tell us. In those societies, characterizing an action as hon- orable is both an evaluative and descriptive judgment. When the moral worth of an action is assessed, the description of the action is compared with the criteria of moral excellence laid down in the moral placard appropriate to the agent's status. And then what we would consider two judgments are made in one stroke: that the criteria are satisfied is established descriptively, and ipso facto approval is bestowed (in a normative way). This depiction is necessarily misleading; it makes us believe that two events take place simultaneously (ascertaining the correspondence between act and model and bestowing moral approval), but we have to resort to this type of account precisely because we distinguish sharply between norm and description. SIN AND FALLIBILITY When I am deprived of guarantors to reassure me that I have acted correctly, I can never be sure that I have actualized the Good in my conduct. The search for goodness becomes an unending quest, and the concept of the Good changes character and becomes entirely formal. Certainly, we may make some rules to live by, but sooner or later we are obliged to scrutinize them with a view to revising them if we want to avoid reverting to a substantively defined concept of morality and defining goodness in terms of our rules of conduct. Even ethical systems which contain explicit models for moral conduct have incorporated this modem concept of morality in their teachings. Apparently the following decrees are on the same level of ethical specificity: "You shall behave like a knight and obey the knightly rules" and "You shall act like Christ and wander in His footsteps." The similarity of these formulations might delude us into believing that Christian ethics is a version of the honor code and a survival of a premodern morality. That is not the case. True, we have a model in Christ, but it is sinful to believe that we are, or possibly could become, like Him and thereby bring our moral search to an end. We are all sinners, and to sin means to miss one's mark; the goal has been set up, but it is unreachable in principle.4 While modern morality says that we are all sinners, modern science in a similar vein insists that we are all fallible. Hence, it is possible to argue that our concept of truth has had the same career as our concept of morality. The truth has also been deprived of all guarantors, and we can no longer revert to</page><page sequence="9">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 9 legitimations of the type "It is true because it is written, because the oracle has spoken, or because is has been revealed." Just when we think we have found a suitable candidate for the job of guarantor of the truth, we are bound to reexamine it for possible flaws, and the quest for the truth therefore becomes an unending project, just like the quest for the Good and the search for our real selves behind all social masks. So science, rather than being identified with its provisional substantive find- ings, has become an infinite research process (Peirce 1960). If we run into people who finish a discussion by referring to uncriticizable guarantors, we raise objections. Therefore we want to object to the statement made by B in the following conversation (recorded from real life), even though he does have a point: A: B's description of the situation seems to be more a reflection of his research paradigm than a description of the actual state of affairs. B: A criticizes me because my report reflects my research paradigm. In- deed, what else could it reflect? Our response to B's repartee brings out our unwillingness to accept the strategy of a person who tries to bring a discussion to its conclusion by referring to a paradigm. If we try to end an exchange of views in this way, our opponent may immediately try to identify the assumptions implicit in our paradigm and subject them to a critical investigation. And we have to go along with this examination unless we are willing to exclude ourselves from the scientific community. To what can A possibly refer when he wants to be critical towards B's research findings? He can refer to facts that are not completely determined by the theoretical frames in which we may situate them. The creation of the individual (posited by modern morality) and the creation of the fact (posited by empiricism)5 go hand in hand: both are autonomous entities which are not totally devoured by the respective social and theoretical constellations they may enter into. THE POSITIVIST REVOLUTION Now we have brought our circular argument to its end. We started out by saying that elements derive their meaning from context, that concepts are intelligible by virtue of the institution or the practice of which they partake, that we cannot identify an isolated fact without a background paradigm which tells us what we should see and how we should see it. This way of thinking got us into problems, because it seemed to make people with radically different cultures and concepts inaccessible to each other. So we make a somersault and claim that we can solve the problem by making all humans equal-and thereby accessible to one another's messages-and by producing paradigmat- ically neutral facts. This turnabout seems to be a blatant example of begging the question; at the outset we denied the very possibility of such entities as paradigmatically neutral facts. To anticipate the argument a little: we want to</page><page sequence="10">10 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH stick to the tenet that there are no such things as context-free facts, but at the same time we want to argue that the concept of the fact created by our particular paradigm of scientific thought is uniquely suited to the juxtaposition and dispassioned examination of diverse cultural worlds. So the point of de- parture for anthropology is not "their world" but "ours," which, like a judge, determines in what manner the testimony of "the Other" shall be allowed to be heard.6 A version of this point is argued by Tor Claussen (1981), to whose position we shall return. What happened with the breakthrough of empiricism was not that we dis- covered the existence of abstract, denatured facts, but we decided to disregard a wide range of properties to see what was left: we tore the world loose from the divine plan which hitherto had made the universe as intelligible as a text, we took away smell and taste and the other secondary sense qualities, we paid no attention to those institutions and power relations which our truths might conceivably legitimize or subvert, and we ruled out of court those psychological processes which might prompt a person to forward a certain statement or theory. We made all these things irrelevant to our search for the truth, and what remained was the bare fact, disrobed and alone in a room by itself, antiseptically separated from the hustle and bustle of our messy everyday world. And it is into that room we enter when we want to find out if some statement is true. At the threshold we shed all our identities, save our status as seekers of truth, and, as we have seen, we are free to do so when we are no longer at one with our social masks; they have become as dispensable as our garments. Only then can we exclude "all motives except that of the co- operative search for the truth" (Habermas 1976:108), and we have arrived at a situation where "man the knower is alienated from the citizen and the moral being" (Gellner 1974:166). We do not discover the bare fact, just as we do not discover the autonomous individual, but we subscribe to a cognitive ethic (Gell- ner's phrase) which demands both. When we say that the notions of the individual and the bare fact depend upon a cognitive ethic, one might object that this ethic is not binding. We might just as well choose to live by the honor code, the ethic of the city-state, or the morality of segmented tribes. But it is doubtful if this option is open to us. Our anthropological ancestors argue convincingly that history cannot be re- versed and that the gates to most gardens of Eden are shut once and for all. I am not saying that our present ethic will never be replaced, but so far, it seems that every argument designed to surmount our present morality and mode of thought is doomed to employ empiricist/individualist terms. It seems a bit futile to say that "the individual is its social status(es), " that all statements are normative and descriptive at the same time, that there are no such things as theoretically neutral facts. Such statements in a sense confirm the distinc- tions they are meant to deny. To put the matter in a somewhat demagogical and perhaps slightly false way, every critique of positivism is parasitic upon it and seems unable to escape the cognitive ethic prescribed by it; every revolt</page><page sequence="11">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 11 against the individualist morality must address itself to the autonomous indi- vidual it wishes to make extinct. Let me illustrate my point by looking at the case of symbolic anthropology. Anthropologists speak of "the shift to meaning" and the hermeneutic paradigm in the social sciences. I have been immersed in the study of meaning for my entire anthropological life and would march any day in support of the "new anthropology," as Hastrup and Ovesen (1975) have called the interpretive turn. It has provided us with indispensable insights; but at least in some expositions of the perspective it is obvious that it, too, is parasitic on a world view which presupposes a cold world devoid of meaning. What I have in mind are expres- sions to the effect that we "ascribe" meaning to the world. We see an eye contracting, and then we ascribe meaning to it in the form of an intention, a wink, a warning, etc.; we see an arm going up in the air, and then we interpret it as an action (a greeting, an act of voting). This way of speaking presupposes the existence of a "meaningless" substrate which we actively bestow with meaning and significance. This contrast between the meaningful end product (which has been brought into existence by an active human subject) and the meaningless substrate is scarcely capable of statement prior to the process Weber described as "the disenchantment of the world." Prior to this demys- tification, we lived in a universe which could be read as any other text (see Taylor 1975) and where "the problem of meaning" simply could not arise. When we start to ponder the problem of meaning, it is a sign that we have already defined something as meaningless (in a certain sense of that word), and this meaninglessness was provided for us by empiricism. We are now ready to make these considerations applicable to the problem of translation and to draw a provisional conclusion that we wish to modify in the last sections of this paper. At least two contemporary theorists-Tor Claussen and Ernest Gellner-seem to endorse this conclusion. But first, we shall make a short detour by way of segmentary opposition. At trials in tribal societies, Burton Benedict says somewhere, it is almost more important to ascertain the social identities of the parties involved than to get a clear account of the train of events. This situation is clearly analogous to what we find in societies dominated by the honor code of ethics: the moral worth of an action cannot be determined in abstracto, but only in relation to the social position of the agent. In a conflict between the segments of a tribal society, loyalty springs out of group membership. If person a gets into a conflict with person b, the whole segments A and B will rally behind their man. In conflicts in our society, our loyalty to our relative (or to some other person with whom we are associated in some way) will not follow automatically in that manner (even though "blood is thicker than water"). I would reflect upon the situation and perhaps reach the conclusion that my relative has behaved in a silly or unjust or immoral fashion and refuse to support him. To be able to draw such a conclusion, I must be equipped with a concept of justice which makes a distinction between justice and the interests which may be at stake</page><page sequence="12">12 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH for my group in a particular conflict. I must be able to imagine a kind of impartial space between the segments where I can stand and evaluate the actions of different people against a common standard, and once this is possible, I may discover that my sense of justice can be at odds with my interests (in a certain sense of "interests"). Is such a divergence of my sense of justice and my interests possible in tribal society? That is obviously an empirical question. To be able to answer it, I must look for situations in which a person fails to do his socially defined duty in keeping with the interests of his segment and yet is praised for it. And we can look for the obverse situation in which a man acts impeccably in the discharge of his duty and yet is morally sanctioned for it. An examination of the role of all institutions of mediation (e.g., the leopard-skin chief among the Nuer) would be important to such a project. But whatever answer we would come up with, the fact remains that the pattern of mobilization in cases of conflicts in tribal society is fairly consistent, and that surely is a sign that the notion of "that which is just" may be identical with "that which serves my interests." We are dealing with what the moral philosophers call an "ethic by loyalty" as opposed to an "ethic by (impartial) rule." Justice has not yet become a formal concept. Traitors are consequently completely dishonored and beyond any possibility of a pardon, for if we are to accord a skein of legitimacy and moral worth to traitors, we must be in the possession of "segment-neutral" concepts of morality, and such standards are hard to come by in a system of segmentary opposition (at least in our stylized version of it). In our society we speak about treason only when we evaluate a small class of acts that are deemed detrimental to the interests of our nations. The logic of segmentary opposition is still very much with us in international affairs, a fact which was clearly demonstrated in Norway recently when the former vice- minister Arne Treholt was arrested for espionage. But even then, a formal, "disinterested" concept of justice was expressed when a number of people defended his actions on the basis of motives and principles that were deemed to take precedence over the national interest. Where the concepts of justice and interest coalesce, saying that "we are in the right" amounts to a tautology, and a statement that "they are in the right" is a logical contradiction. Changing our minds about whose cause is just under such circumstances is tantamount to changing social identity, to "joining the enemy." To concede that the enemy group is in the right is to give up mem- bership in our own group. We are either inside or outside. Notice how this looks like Kuhn's description of our leaving one paradigm for another: it does not happen gradually, in a "quantitative" fashion, but in leaps and bounds. As long as we find ourselves inside a paradigm, we are by definition unable to criticize it, and as soon as we do criticize it, we have exiled ourselves from it. We can recognize this logic at work in contemporary totalitarian regimes. As long as a political line remains in force, correct political action is conditional</page><page sequence="13">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 13 on its conformity to the party line; a yardstick or laudable political action outside the central committee is simply not to be found. Die Partei hat immer Recht (the party is always in the right). (Notice how the term "correct action" is normative and descriptive at the same time.) Hence, a change of political direction occurs in the form of a gestalt shift; the old line is blamed for every- thing under the sun (cf. the Chinese gang of four), and we grab for the re- touching equipment to beautify our photo album. Such a logic is inevitable when we identify justice with interests. How, then, do we bring about the transition from an ethic of loyalty to an ethic of impartial rule? We do it simply by setting in motion the processes we have already described: we tear actions loose from all substantive moral plac- ards and interests; we extricate the autonomous agent from his social con- stellations and foment an opposition between the two; we make a distinction between justice and interests (between norm and description); we produce transcontextual facts (murder is murder, regardless of context, almost; busi- ness is business). In sum, we bring about modem society, where individuals may change their social identities and preserve their individual authenticity intact, where facts may enter into diverse theoretical frames without com- pletely drowning in any of them. Here, then, is the provisional conclusion: only in a society that has run through this course are we able to put ourselves at a distance from our par- adigms and wander in and out of them the way we change our shirts. Our "disinterested" concepts of truth and morality enable us to criticize all estab- lished truths and rules of conduct (excepting the rule that enjoins us to be critical) and to put ourselves beyond them. This does not mean that our dominant mode of understanding is completely empty, that is, without deter- minate properties. But those properties that our outlook does possess are uniquely suited to the juxtaposition and disinterested examination of competing outlooks. It may be sufficient to draw attention to our distinction between "is" and "ought" to make the point: this distinction is at the very base of the anthropological enterprise and enables us to give dispassionate descriptions of alien cultures without engaging our moral approval or disapproval. We have already tried to establish that these forms of judgment-description and moral (dis)approval-are separate events in modem society, while they are far less easily distinguished in premodern cultural formations. There is a plausible ring to this argument, which-in extremis-would extend the gift of tongues to a certain type of society only (see, e.g., Claussen 1981:24). But there is something amiss with it, too. And in saying that, I am not concerned with the possible political consequences of such a position. A reasonable corollary of the argument would be that the mission of our civilization is to educate other societies, so that they become able to enter into dialogue with us on our terms. This conclusion would seem to follow from the premise that other bases for a dialogue do not exist; it happens to be us who invented universal man, and without that invention, the universal dialogue is impossible.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH APPEALS, OBLIGATIONS, AND RESPONSIBILITY The position briefly outlined above posits a radical discontinuity between modem and premodern societies. I would like to soften this distinction by encircling some properties which I believe all concepts of truth, action, and morality must possess for any society to exist at all.7 We have maintained that modem actions are emancipated from all recipes for action: we demand that they be authentic in the sense that they do not simply duplicate a prototypical model; they are supposed to be creative in the sense that they shall intervene into the world and not be satisfied with the existing state of affairs. Let us try to imagine a possible contrast to such actions. What I have in mind is a mode of acting which is a reliable source of humor and which Henri Bergson has analyzed in Le rire (1900). I shall illustrate my point with a few examples from some silent movies whose titles escape me. In one of the movies, a meek shopowner is being held up by a robber. In one way or another, the crook loses his gun, and the shopkeeper gets hold of it and points it timidly at him. The robber feels confident that the merchant is incapable of pulling the trigger and refuses to obey his orders. When the crook refuses to comply, the shopkeeper can think of no other way out than to exclaim, "But I have the gun!" Our hero refers to the script, the action recipe which says that those who carry a weapon are entitled to give orders to those who do not. He refers to a "rule" that specifies which kind of conduct is appropriate in a given situation and reminds the crook that he is deviating from the script. That is what makes the situation laughable, and a lesson may be drawn from this kind of comedy. In the second movie we are watching a twerp of a policeman who is running, baton in hand, after a giant of a bandit. We find it amusing that the midget is chasing the ogre, and that is already a sign that we regard slavish script- imitations as comical (the script, or rule, which says that the police are supposed to chase the crooks and not the other way around). After a while the criminal gets worn out and sits down to rest, and immediately the policeman sits down to wipe his brow too. So, all of a sudden, the two men are engaged in a different activity with a different script attached to it; they are having a picnic. Then the crook gets up and starts running again, the policeman catches up with him, and the scene changes from a pursuit to a relay race: the bandit grabs the baton from the policeman and keeps running until the officer catches up again and takes over the "relay stick." The source of comedy in these sequences is the fact that the actions are "syntactical" in the way described above-they are totally bound to the script- and as soon as one of the actors suggests that a new script is introduced, the actions immediately conform to it (in the first example the attempt to enforce conformity failed). The shopkeeper refers explicitly to the script which says that one is not supposed to disobey a man with a gun. The policeman who sits down to rest with the crook does not object to the script that the bandit draws</page><page sequence="15">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 15 out of his hat. In each sequence, the actors imitate a given pattern of behavior, and they do it in a machinelike, totally rule-following manner. In consequence, their behavior ceases to consist of actions. They no longer act because they no longer act strategically. The comical thing about the policeman who sits down to rest is that he does not take advantage of the fact that the crook is exhausted. What makes actions real is seriousness and strategy. Imagine a quarrel. To be able to quarrel we must be familiar with the quarrel game. We must be able to recognize utterances and gestures that build up to a confrontation; we must know which repartees make sense, etc. To be capable of quarreling is therefore to be in command of a set of rules, a model, a "form of life." But if I select my arguments by ransacking my archive of counterar- guments and deliver them the way I believe the script for a quarrel prescribes, the whole point of the fight is gone. A real quarrel requires a certain seriousness; it demands that we have an intention vis-A-vis the opponent. So we adopt a strategy, and we do not find it by looking into an archive of such procedures (even though we may be able to classify the strategy as a dear and familiar trick once the dust has settled). Acts that are rule-following in a machinelike way are not only comical, they also seem to destroy what we usually understand by communication. Com- munication consists of requests, appeals, petitions, and the like, and it is these modes of address that are rendered senseless by a syntactical form of inter- action. Appeals or requests summon us to behave in a certain manner. Such summonses only make sense if they can produce a result, that is, if we act in a way which would have been different had the request not been made. If we possessed a script to follow in each situation and the script contained an exhaustive formula for our action, such requests would be utterly pointless. They would purport to change something which could not be changed. Let us consider the following objection to this argument: the person to whom we appeal possesses a number of potentially suitable scripts, and by making a request we are simply suggesting which script we think is appropriate to the situation. But this objection merely moves the problem one step back. If the person does not have a "super script" which tells him when the different subscripts will be plugged in, he will have to decide whether or not to follow our suggestion, and in making this decision, he will have to adopt a "script- less" strategy. If, on the contrary, he were equipped with a super script, our request would be as pointless as in the first instance. In other words, a possible contrast to our nonsyntactical concept of action precludes the making of requests, which is tantamount to the extinction of all real communication. A human act must have a certain measure of script-in- dependence in order to be an action at all, and man must in a sense be free. A society without morality-and, in the final analysis, morality is about making and responding to requests-is no society at all. Can we present an analogous argument when we move on to the concept of truth? When we speak of truth, we are concerned with the relationship between a statement and acceptable criteria of truth. When we last touched upon the</page><page sequence="16">16 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH subject, we said that the emergence of the modern concept of truth implied a norm which enjoined us to adopt a critical attitude towards all putative guar- antors of truth. I believe it is possible to argue that even in societies which harbor apparently unassailable guarantors of truth-oracles, seers, reality spe- cialists with privileged access to the ultimate nature of things-allowances are made for a limited criticism of these sources of revelation; but since the ar- gument is rather cumbersome, I shall let it lie. Instead, I will try to give an account of the role telling the truth plays in human intercourse and to imagine what it would be like to have access to foolproof truth tests. When we consider a statement made by someone and conclude that he is telling the truth, we sometimes do so because the statement is confirmed by others or because we get a chance to verify it for ourselves. But there will always be a possible reason for doubt: if others confirm the statement, we may distrust them, and if we are in a position to inspect the state of affairs that the statement refers to, we can never be sure that it has not changed from the moment the statement was made to the moment we got a chance to look into the matter. In spite of this, almost all interaction is founded on the supposition that most people speak the truth most of the time. If a driver stops us on the road to tell us that we must take a detour because the main road is blocked by a landslide, we choose a different route; every time we eat at a restaurant, we accept a tacit promise from the owner that the food is not poisoned. If it turns out that the other driver and the restaurant owner do not speak the truth, they are called to account and held responsible for their statements. What are the things we can be held responsible for? We can be held responsible for breaches of the obligations we have incurred, and it is just such an obligation we incur when we say something and, by implication, vouch for its truth. This is essentially an Austin/Wittgenstein argument (see Pitkin 1972 for a lucid exposition). Let us now assume that we have access to foolproof truth tests, guarantors of truth that we can consult each time we hear a statement being made. Let us imagine that we can walk about with a pocket oracle and administer truth tests the way the police administer tests to drunken drivers; or imagine a society of Pinocchios where we can ascertain the truthfulness of our fellow men by looking at the sizes of their noses. In such a society we would never be able to deceive anyone, and without the possibility of deceit, the notion of telling the truth is meaningless (see MacIntyre 1966 for a version of this point). If telling the truth is senseless, we are deprived of the means to create obli- gations by telling the truth and no longer run the risk of being held responsible for our mendacity. Under such circumstances, we would decipher the messages we send one another the way we read traffic signs. Real communication- which always carries with it a moral component in the form of an obligation- would deteriorate and become a mere exchange of signals. In short, what we rely upon to create relations between people would no longer exist: veracity, obligation, and responsibility.</page><page sequence="17">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 17 I have already dropped the clue "ambiguity." Let us seize upon that to make a digression which will hopefully lead us back to our starting point. Bits of communication and meaningful items of various sorts are first and foremost polysemic, if I may use that term in a rather loose and untechnical sense. They carry with them a range of possible meanings which we may activate according to need. This fact has two important consequences: when someone addresses himself to us, we have to interpret his initiative before we react to it, and besides the possibility always exists that we misunderstand-that is, misclas- sify-the initiative, the sign, the gesture, or whatever. The "same" sign of affection may be everything from consolation, "glad to see you," or "good- bye," to an erotic prelude. It is the bearer of a range of potential meanings, it is amenable to different ways of classification, and it is by virtue of these alternative classifications that the sign signifies, that it is in need of interpre- tation, that it may possibly be misunderstood. If a certain caress had only one meaning and belonged exclusively to one context, the need to interpret it and the possibility of misunderstanding it would be eliminated. Communication would then be reduced to a series of stimuli and responses, and I think most of us would agree that a simple stimulus-response model misses what is communicative and meaningful about human interaction. Let us venture a step further. Imagine a state of affairs where an expression, a gesture, a sentence does not have only one possible meaning but is allowed to carry a certain limited number of meanings. Let us say, for example, that the phrase "It is raining" has only three possible meanings: "Remember to take the umbrella with you," "We have to cancel our Sunday outing," or "We are going to have a fine harvest this fall." Is there a fundamental difference between an expression having only one meaning and one with only three meanings? In the first case, the expression is absolutely unequivocal and cannot function communicatively-that is, be an object of interpretation and misun- derstanding. In the second case, where the expression may have three mean- ings, we are dealing with a closed polysemy. Then what? It would surely prevent us from putting new meanings into these expressions, they would not be capable of semantic extension, and their use in new metaphorizations would be out of the question. What we want to argue is that closed polysemy is as destructive of signification and communication as unequivocality and that this has important consequences for the problem of cultural translation. MEANING AND MORALITY When we legislate that an expression may carry only a limited number of meanings, we put ourselves in a position which is analogous to that of our hypothetical actor who is in possession of a limited number of action scripts. We saw how the agent, thus handicapped, became an unreachable addressee of moral appeals, and that the restriction consequently jeopardized the very possibility of morality. In a roughly analogous fashion, the restriction of the possible uses of a linguistic unit to, say, the expression of three messages</page><page sequence="18">18 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH drastically curtails the possibility of communication and transmission of meaning by means of that unit. If we know that a certain expression is allowed to carry only three meanings, we can be certain in advance that we will have interpreted the utterance correctly if we successively act on the three possibilities. There will be no room for further doubt or failure of understanding, and-as we have seen- when the possibility of misunderstanding is eliminated, there is no need for interpretation, and hence no meaning is conveyed. It is an axiom of all theories of human communication that the absolute predictability of an utterance reduces the informative content of that utterance to nil. (E.g., Lyons [1968:89]: "A linguistic unit, of whatever level, has no meaning in a given context if it is completely predictable in that context.") Extending the permissible use of an expression to the performance of three illocutionary acts simply means that it will take us a little longer time to ascertain which meaning is intended. In both cases, certainty is readily at hand; in the end we are guaranteed that we have interpreted the utterance correctly. And certainty is the great killer of meaning. If we maintain that meaning and communication presuppose the need for interpretation and the risk of misunderstanding, we must be willing to concede that there will always be room for doubt and that interpretation in principle can go on forever. For all practical purposes, of course, "doubt must come to an end," but since the set of possible meanings of an utterance (or concept, or expression) can never be fully determinate, the process is in principle never- ending. The fact that meaning must always be indeterminate becomes apparent when we consider all the contexts which are potentially relevant to the interpretation of an utterance: my own and my interlocutor's personal history, the situation at hand, last night's news on TV, and so on. Not only must the listener be prepared to draw on all kinds of contexts to get at the speaker's intensions, but the speaker is free to utilize a similar range of contexts to do all sorts of things with his utterance; depending on the circumstances, the same utterance may be used to convey information, issue warnings, or make jokes, threats, or promises. The speaker may help us out by using so-called function-indicating devices and so forth, but our interpretation is always practical, always provi- sional, always revisable in light of new information-that is, always in principle open to doubt. When we say that the meaning of "It is raining" must be open-ended rather than confined to a limited set of meanings, what we seem to be saying is that we are free to perform an indeterminate number of acts with that expression. The thesis of freedom of action (required by morality) and the thesis of open- ness of meaning (required by human understanding) are therefore closely con- nected, if not identical. This suggests an intimate relationship between meaning and morality, which will be elaborated below. Let us pause and look at the contrast between closed equivocality and openness, which allows us to put new meanings into an expression, a concept, a gesture. Take the example of ethnic incorporation (Eidheim 1971). What</page><page sequence="19">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 19 happens in a process of ethnic incorporation is that the cultural elements of an ethnic group are classified as equivalent to (yet in contrast to) the cultural expressions of the dominant society and thus made comparable to them. The joik of the Saami is reclassified: once stigmatized as demeaning cacophony, it is now classed as Saami folk music via a metaphorization ("a is really a kind of b").8 How do we give an account of this reclassification? Do we say that the Saami have simply opened the archive containing the possible ways of classifying the joik and then activated a meaning which has been there all the time, waiting to be made operative? Such an archive would contain a list of the finite number of meanings the joik could possibly have and thus would exemplify what we have called closed polysemy. Such an account of the reclassification seems odd and farfetched. We would rather say that the Saami have ascribed new meaning to the joik, a meaning which was not filed in any archive in advance. The Saami have not simply reminded us of the fact that "folk music" is one of the ways the joik may be classified, but they have urged us to look at the joik in a new way. How can Norwegians find this reclassification reasonable, and how are the Saami able to justify it? "Everything is false," says an old Russian proverb, highlighting the apparent impossibility of justifying something new by reference to existing criteria of true and false, right and wrong. It would be impossible to find such reclassifications reasonable if our concepts could not be stretched in new and unforeseen directions. But this is exactly what we are able to do. It is even conceivable that the ability of an element to carry meaning is contingent on this capacity for stretching and that this requirement is as necessary as the requirement of polysemy. If this is the case, we are en route to an interesting thesis: the reason why languages (in a wide sense) can convey meaning and function communicatively is that they can be expanded beyond themselves; that is, their creativity is a condition of their existence. No doubt, such a thesis, which embraces both meaning and morality, would have a bearing on our initial problem. But perhaps the matter is not as simple as all that. Wittgenstein himself warns that even though concepts are stretchable, they cannot be meaningfully projected in all directions at all times. Our attempts at metaphorization are subject to constraints-a dear and familiar thought to anthropologists. In our times, projects of ethnic incorporation have been successful in many parts of the world, where stigmatized cultural traits have been infused with new and destigmatized meanings. This would probably have been far more difficult some centuries ago, when primitives were regarded as not quite fully grown humans. Only a few years ago, homosexuality was considered a perversion; now it has become an alternative kind of sexuality-an instance of a successful attempt at reclassification. A very interesting and until now undecided case is the Danish "crazy movement" of mental patients, whose aim seems to be to define madness as an alternative understanding of reality. If they succeed, we might witness a revival of an old concept of madness, as described by Foucault (1973). I have seen efforts made to define low intelligence as "alternative intelligence"-what</page><page sequence="20">20 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH is required for such a project to succeed? "Workers in all countries-unite!" is quite intelligible, and the slogan has, as we know, been of some importance in modem times. But what if someone tried to repeat the success with "Klep- tomaniacs in all countries-unite!"? I'll be damned if I know. "Black Power" is understandable and effective, but what about "Fat Power"? This list of examples is evidence that we are able to create new meanings which were not filed and stored in advance. But it also shows that not all efforts to reclassify are possible at all times, and this opens up the possibility for a fascinating field of study: an investigation of the factors responsible for the viability of metaphors. Such an investigation would probably conclude that different societies use their creative resources to develop their systems of signification in diverse directions (meaning that we can speak of cultural change without assuming that other cultures are headed in our direction, as some evolutionists have believed). Such an investigation would also shed light on the question whether some societies more than others make use of their potential to create new meanings. Both questions are classical evolutionist concerns which would sooner or later force us to confront the issue of ahistorical versus historical societies. In an earlier section we argued that telling the truth is perhaps the most important way of creating obligations between people and that this depends on the possibility of deceit. When I trust someone, I am deciding to believe that he is telling the truth, in spite of the ever-present possibility that he may in fact be lying. Paradoxically, then, the fact that I may doubt his sincerity is the reason why it is possible to enter into relations of trust and obligation with him. I can never be certain that he is telling the truth, and this very doubt is the cement of social relationships. Now we can see that the formation of social relationships and acts of inter- pretation rest on the same "law of uncertainty," that morality and meaning derive their existence from the same source, as it were. The parallelism can be sketched this way: Morality Meaning Goals achieved trust, obligation understanding (established by telling the truth) Presuppositions possibility of possibility of of goal deceit misunderstanding achievement Processes of in principle in principle endless verification/ endless (truth (indeterminacy of interpretation comes without a meaning) guarantee) "Metaphysical" freedom of action openness of meaning conclusions</page><page sequence="21">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 21 Mary Douglas once envisioned an inspired encounter between Wittgenstein and Durkheim (Douglas 1975:xix). We may now adduce an additional reason why they would enjoy each other's company. Wittgenstein argued that we can make sense of language only by taking account of the actions we perform with it; "speaking is always performing an action for whose consequences the speaker is responsible" (Wittgenstein as paraphrased by Pitkin 1972:39). If the inter- pretation of meaning includes the identification of an action and acting/speaking always entails responsibility, an intimate relationship exists between meaning- the central concept of semantics-and obligation-the central concept of ethical discourse; that is, the Wittgensteinian view of meaning as use and the Dur- kheimian vision of society as a moral order support each other mutually. Mean- ing, truth, action, and morality stand and fall together.9 Well, then, if we want to say that all humans communicate and exchange meanings (and I assume we do want to say that), we must grant them the conceptual openness upon which the exchange of meanings depends, the way we had to grant them freedom of action in order to allow for the possibility of morality and obligation. That is, we have to concede to them (and to ourselves) the very creativity which is all they, and we, need to break out of the pris- onhouse of culture; indeed, the jailbreaker needs no other tools than he has. And this is all we need to know in order to understand how the "fusion of horizons" is possible. We need not (and indeed should not) presuppose a preex- isting overlap between diverse systems of thought in order to account for the articulation of cultures. The freedom which goes into the construction of cultural meanings also provides a way out of them; any culture contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction, the very same seeds it uses to produce and reproduce itself. Sometimes this potential for self-transformation is not ac- tualized, and, no doubt, different cultures make different uses of their capacity for change; but the capacity is inherent in the way we construct and exchange meanings and create bonds of obligation. SO WHAT? Let us recapitulate a bit. We started out with some ideas that seemed to turn cultures into incommensurable worlds with no access to each other. Then we examined the emergence of the modern individualist morality as an example of a process of mediation which breaks down the walls between separate universes. This morality coincides with a concept of the autonomous individual who can criticize inherited moral placards, and the new ethic is a part of a general process of modernization which involves more abstraction, commen- surability, and self-criticism. Such considerations led us into a position which put our own civilization in a privileged position, with a monopoly of those tools of comparison which permit reflection upon radically alien modes of under- standing. But if we formulate a certain contrast to the achievements we have seen emerge out of history-a universalistic morality, a self-critical concept of truth,</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH the creative act, and the autonomous individual--we may end up with a de- scription of an impossible society and reduce culture to nature. If we accept that we cannot conceive of a society without requests, obligations, and relations of responsibility, we must agree that we everywhere will find a morality which permits the making of requests, a concept of truth which is capable of forging bonds of obligation and responsibility between men, and a form of communi- cation which does not reduce the exchange of messages to the swapping of one-dimensional signals. The argument for the ubiquity of free action, open systems of meaning, and moral choice in no way denies the existence of different forms of action, heterogeneous modes of signification, diverse canons of truth, and multifarious standards of morality. We want to stick to the distinction between modem and traditional morality (and the corresponding notions of truth) which we drew in the first part of this paper, roughly described as a contrast between syntactical and authentic action, between context-bound and universal morality, between the status-bound and the autonomous agent. It is perhaps true that the Western configuration of individualism, scientific criticism, and universalist morality sets us apart from other cultures. But the capacity to exercise moral judgment, to enter into obligations and assume responsibility, to act and speak and interpret creatively is omnipresent if communication is. There is a vast expanse of moral space between "so act as to treat humanity whether in thine own person or that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as a means only" (Kant) and "you may not kill a member of your in-group, yet the taking of life outside is meritorious" (Barton 1949 on the Kalingas). There is a vast difference in self-criticalness between the Popperian admonition to falsify our beliefs and the limits to skepticism inherent in the reasoning of the Azande, who "are only skeptical of particular oracles and not of oracles in general, and their skepticism is always expressed in a mystical idiom that vouches for the validity of the poison oracle as an institution" (Evans- Pritchard 1976:163). There is a gulf of juridical principle between "equality before the law" and a situation where "the same act may be regarded differently according to the relative social positions of the individuals involved in the action" (Fuirer-Haimendorf about tribal law, 1967:163). And, finally, there are different principles of abstraction at the base of the entities of modern science and the abstract, yet anthropomorphic, deities of the Kalabari (although Horton 1967 uses the example to argue for the continuity, rather than the discontinuity, between modern science and primitive religion). From our point of view, the first parts of the equations above are "formal," while the latter are "substantive." What sets them apart is the range of prin- ciples and beliefs that can be subjected to criticism, the categories of persons that can be legitimate addressees of moral appeals, and the location of the terminal where the quest for truth must come to an end. What they have in common is the very existence of standards of morality, canons of interpretation, and the fact of abstraction.</page><page sequence="23">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 23 If this is correct, there is a critical potential to be found in all societies, and we are faced with the task of showing how this potential is expressed in some way. The data for such a study are to be found in the ethnographies that have already been -ritten, and the monographs may be reanalyzed with such a task in mind. When we embark on such an investigation, we should not necessarily go looking for exotic versions of ourselves, although that would be tempting. The modem individual is perhaps something entirely new in the history of mankind, but we do find elsewhere-at least in rudimentary form-the idea that the individual is something more than its social attributes. Although speaking about the birth of the individual in the West, Dumont and Berger et al. hedge their baldest statements in the following ways: "modem man is not a total innovation or a mutation of the species," although "there are far-reaching differences in the ways in which identity is conceived" (Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1974:91); and Dumont (1970:9) makes a distinction between "the empirical agent, present in every society" and "the rational being and normative subject of institutions," which is "peculiar to us." So, although the genre of biography may make sense only in a handful of societies, the reality of individual distinction is more widely recognized (e.g., in the Melanesian big-man institution and the Tiv concept of "men of strong heart" who convert goods across economic spheres). Our cognitive ethic, which is marked by a self-critical attitude, is perhaps a new phenomenon. But do not liminal phases constitute a watchtower from which the initiates can survey the basic assumptions and taken-for-granted reality of their culture? As we know, the liminal phase cancels the social order and redraws the cognitive maps for the neophytes. This does not mean that the social and cultural realities of the tribe are made the topic of an explicit philosophical reflection. Yet, liminal phases are cultural means of transporting oneself "outside" everyday reality, and as such they are tools of criticism comparable to, yet different from, discursive reflection. To me, these are examples of critical fields in societies that qualify for the epithet "closed." What are the implications of this for our day-to-day work as anthropologists? Has it only been a heavy-handed exercise which concludes with insights we already have and carry with us in our anthropological practice? I don't know. But as long as the problem of translation continues to pop up in new disguises, it is worth the effort to try to tackle it head-on. Besides, if there is some truth to the conclusions we have reached, they might be of consequence to the rhetoric we use in our roles as applied anthropologists and to our lives as ordinary political beings. What we did in the first part of the paper amounted to a reformulation of a thesis forwarded by our predecessors: the concepts we use to organize our existence have a history, and their development has organizational correlates (bureaucratization, etc.). As advocates of the Fourth World, we champion the efforts of minorities to preserve their own culture and defend their rights to</page><page sequence="24">24 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH develop it on their own terms; we assist in the construction of organizational structures designed to protect Fourth-World cultures from a global and uniform civilization. When we say that people have a right to live by their own culture, we do not simply mean that they may dress the way they like or build their houses in the old fashion. We also want our advocacy to ensure the perpetuation of diverse modes of thought and the continued existence of the organizational forms in which they are enmeshed--organizational forms that are far removed from our bureaucracies. In our roles as advocates, we help build organizational instruments that can effectively promote the cause of the group in question. But these structures must in some way articulate with "our" organs of power, and in order that this articulation come about, it looks like their organizations must function on "our" terms. Thereby, the Fourth World is exposed to a pincer attack from a modem economic system, from the political institutions of the national state, and from organizational tools that are designed to preserve cultural autonomy but turn out to be just as westernizing as the factory and the parliament. There is a double bind here somewhere: to mobilize effectively in cultural self-defense, the Fourth World must use culturally alien tools of accommodation, which militate against the ideal of remaining true to one's culture. One may object that I am using a rather static concept of culture here and that few anthropologists want to put the Fourth World in a museum. But then again, my criticism is not directed at our practice as minority advocates but rather at the rhetoric with which we justify it and the inadequate understanding of what we in fact are doing. Formulas to the effect that we must "preserve" cultures are far too often part and parcel of this rhetoric. The second practical concern that I believe must be affected by our reasoning so far is our attitude toward utopias. To be sure, we need utopias, but many of them unfortunately hold out expectations of the "finished" society for us. A "finished" society is a society which eliminates those conditions for the exis- tence of morality, communication, and action that we have identified in the latter half of this paper. In the rhetoric of some political movements, we are promised that the scales shall fall from our eyes as soon as we have vanquished those who have distorted reality for us; man is to become one with his "essence" and no longer has to search for himself. They hold out to us the ending of history, which will herald a new coalescence of knowledge and morality, a reconciliation of the individual with his social environment, and the contempla- tion of an ultimate truth which is no longer provisional. What would a society envisioned by this rhetoric look like? It would be free from myths in the sense that truth would have been perfected, and it would leave nothing in the dark. It would be amoral in the sense that our actions would automatically flow from our knowledge of the world. Our language would be "true" so that no extensions of meaning would be desirable or possible. Then we truly would have created a society which could not conceivably be improved, but at the same time we would have eradicated morality, action,</page><page sequence="25">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 25 metaphor, and language. The "finished" language is finished in all senses of the word-language continues to live only as long as new meanings are created. That is the case for communication as well, for what can I convince you about when everything is revealed? When everything has fallen into place, all com- munication becomes redundant, and our symbols decay into signals. All action loses its creativity and its power to say "no" to the existing state of affairs. The French philosopher Alexandre Kojeve and his compatriot, Michel Fou- cault, herald the dissolution of man. But fortunately there are other bidders on the marketplace of prophecy. Simmel (1950:84) thinks in terms of continuous transformations rather than abysmal discontinuities: I should prefer to believe, however, that the ideas of free personality as such and of unique personality as such are not the last words of individ- ualism. Simmel does not speak of the birth and death of the individual, but rather of its transformations; and we should think he would talk in the same vein about the modes of action and communication which we have associated with the rise of the individual. To me, these are more promising guidelines for historical and ethnographical research than the philosophies of discontinuity- even though the latter deservedly continue to propagate waves of intellectual excitement. NOTES 1. This paper is based on a number of working papers written in the latter half of the 1970s and on a lecture series given in 1981 at the University of Oslo. It was first read in Norwegian to the Semiannual Meeting of Nordic Ethnographers in Oslo, August 1984, and published in the Proceedings from that meeting (Retorikk og mytedannelse: kampen om og med meningsparadigmene, Department of Social Anthropology, University of Oslo, 1984). It was also presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Anthro- pological Association in Washington, D.C., December 1985. The lecture series was held the same year that Habermas's Theorie des kommuni- kativen Handelns appeared, a work which is of paramount importance to the problem discussed here. I apologize to Tor Claussen for not doing full justice to his position. Originally what I thought was a puzzle and a problem, he thought was the solution to the problem of translation; that is probably still the case. Hans Christian Sorhaug is not mentioned in the paper, but our relationship over the past ten years has inevitably put its stamp on it. 2. A notable exception is Ernest Geliner's Legitimation of Belief (1974), where, it seems to me, he gives each position its due. 3. A number of students of modernity have commented on the significance of these and related phenomena; among them are Steven Lukes (1973), Jurgen Habermas (1976), Ernest Gellner (1974), Peter Berger (1969), and Alisdair Maclntyre (1966). The most important classics in this connection are Weber (in Gerth and Mills 1958) and Simmel (1950).</page><page sequence="26">26 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 4. It is somewhat mistaken to say that Christian ethics has adapted itself to the modern morality. Our morality and our concept of the individual did not leap into existence with the collapse of feudalism but have many and long roots. One of the roots can be found in the commandment of charity (e.g., in the parable about the Samaritan who recognizes a fellow human being in the Jew, in spite of the social distance that separates them). Also, the roots can be found in the Greek city-state which turned all free men into citizens (but see MacIntyre 1966 for a discussion of the contrast between classical Greek and modern morality). 5. Cf. Gellner (1974:166): "The important achievement of empiricist propaganda is the establishment of the autonomy of fact." 6. Compare the Kantian conception of the relationship between scientist and nature: "Though the scientist must . .. approach Nature to learn from her, he must not do so simply in the spirit of a pupil. Rather, he must approach Nature as a judge, compelling her to answer the questions which he proposes, as a judge insists on witnesses an- swering the questions proposed to them according to a plan. . . . He must not allow himself simply to follow her about like a child in leading-strings" (Copleston 1964:23). Although the study of nature and the study of man warrant different approaches, we need to be reminded that our ethnographies are structured by rules of relevance which are not entirely dictated by the cultures we study. 7. Put another way, what I feel we need is a justification of the way all humans are our potential partners in dialogue in a way that animals and volcanoes are not. This may seem a superfluous demand, yet there were periods in our history when a dialogue between certain other upright bipeds and ourselves seemed impossible (some of them were defined as the missing link between man and the monkey tribes and-if we are to believe de Toqueville-there were times of inequality when there were as many distinct humanities as there were social categories). Today there are ecologically minded philosophers and anthropologists who, instead of restricting the basis for dialogue, want to extend it to include nature (ecological crises are nature's way of saying "no"). But mostly we tend to take the boundaries of dialogue to be coextensive with the boundaries of humankind (which is then presumably identified by other criteria than by its inclusion in that dialogue). In the face of radical theories of cultural relativism, this seems to call for some kind of justification. 8. The joik is a traditional Saami way of singing. The songs consist of a short text which is usually repeated several times. Originally, it had magico-religious significance and was also used to describe persons in a satirical fashion. For a number of years joiking was considered sinful because it was associated with heavy drinking and heathen- ism. Today, however, it has gained status as an ethnic emblem and is performed on all sorts of occasions. 9. Incidentally, this insight provides a basis for a synthesis of three important par- adigms in anthropology which occasionally have been construed as antagonistic: inter- pretative anthropology (the elucidation of meaning, e.g., Geertz), transactional anthropology (focusing on strategic action, e.g., Barth), and structural (not structuralist) anthropology (focusing on bonds of rights and duties, e.g., Fortes). Morality, strategic action, and meaning are not mutually exclusive vantage points from which to view society and culture. When we use one of them as a starting point, we inevitably have to take account of the two others: the fundamental meaningfulness of social life (calling for interpretation rather than causal explanation) presupposes the exercise of choice (amenable to strategic analysis), and the description of choice and action is inevitably a description of the</page><page sequence="27">ACTION, MORALITY, AND CULTURAL TRANSLATION 27 responsibilities we assume and the obligations we enter into when we act (statable in the language of law and morals). The deplored opposition between actor-oriented and symbol-oriented approaches (e.g., Cohen 1974) is, in the final analysis, no opposition at all, nor is the legal metaphor which so strongly informed British social anthropology in the forties and fifties emasculated by the return of the rather Hobbesian actor in the next decade.
