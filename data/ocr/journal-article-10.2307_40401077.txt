<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science: The Glorious Entertainment, by Jacques Barzun. New York: Harper and Row, 1964. $6.00. Pp. 322. In a world in which science and culture have become atomized by machine-induced division of labor into a myriad of specialties, the necessary task of generalizing has been sadly neglected. A critical gen- eral analysis is a prerequisite to this unification. This is what Jacques Barzun has assayed in his book under review. Barzun contends that machines and a machine-based science have yielded abundance and leisure but have rendered man incapable of the enjoyment of these and have robbed him of creativity. Mechanization requires abstraction and the division of labor. In abstraction, elements of real things and relationships are lost. Abstraction and the division of labor give rise to excessive specialization (specialism). The machine and science have caused the abandonment of purpose. Man is contemplated as a machine, machines as men. Only objective phenomena are deemed fit for study by modern science. The subjective- consciousness, reason, feeling, sen- sibility and purpose- are beyond the pale. The author writes of the recent history of these concepts: It was the mid eighteen-fifties that the achievements of the Age of Reason in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology were given sudden and violent publicity by the controversy over Darwin's Origin of Species. Evolution was not new and Darwin did not discover it ... but the . . . debate made plain two things: One was that the men of science formed a powerful party whom western civilization would now have to reckon with. The other was that pure science was engaged in sketching, bit by bit, the plan of a machine- a gigantic machine identical with the universe. . . . Leading scientists were willing to affirm that for any formulation of science a mechanical model could be built. The mechanization of science led to the enthronement of cause- and-effect logic. "We find it almost impossible to conceive of action without sequence. We always imagine one thing coming first and push- ing the rest-Heredity or Environment, the gene behind the trait. Inter- play-simultaneous, reversible, inconstant- we cannot grasp with com- mon sense; and it cannot be condoned by science, despite all the elee-</page><page sequence="2">476 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY trons in captivity if science is to keep its order of accident, rejecting the order of purpose." It is possible that Barzun's overt and implicit attacks on Darwinism and genetics did more to stir up the hornet's nest than the diatribes against the pernicious effects of the machine, "Techne," abstraction, excessive specialization and loss of purpose. "Science itself," he writes, "through its increased prosperity and fact-breeding specialism, has con- tributed to the disturbance and distress, while the technology of auto- mation, nerve gas, germ warfare, and atomic destruction have driven home the lesson of human helplessness directly proportional to 'human control over nature/" Such statements are just as unlikely to endear the author to orthodox scientists as his stand on specialism, Darwinism and genetics, and his endorsement of purpose in life. Other sections of the book add fuel to the fire by discussing the shortcomings of the mechanical approach in the arts, teaching, behavioristic psychology and other fields. Barzun transcends the common sense view that mechanical mate- rialism is sufficient. Mentioning the "cruel world of nature, red in tooth and claw" and its place of origin, industrial England, he shrewdly notes that ". . . the idea of cruel nature must be a fallacy in a system that excludes purpose." It is disappointing that he did not show that pur- pose itself can be explained on a materialistic basis. Had he done this he would have given the book a much needed philosophical unity. George Henry Lewes, an opponent of Darwin and Huxley and the mentor and consort of George Eliot, laid the foundation for this in his Physical Basis of Mind (1877). Despite its keen insights into the failings of mechanical materialism in science and the excessive reliance upon the mechanical, this book illustrates the inability of Barzun to expound a consistent non- mechanical materialism. To do this one must join the mechanical and the non-mechanical in a higher unity. The book contains false gen- eralizations that blame the machine and science for shortcomings that stem from the socio-economic system. Barzun seems to desire restric- tion of the machine and science as though this would heal the social hurt. "The machine must somehow be hushed, tamed, fenced off from the person at certain times and places." Such restrictions of labor- savings devices will not help humanity. How much better if science could recognize that humanity is much more important that the machine. When Barzun writes: "To live in society, which is to say in the relations of love, work, conversation, parenthood, or conviviality calls for judgments incommensurable with those of scientific fact and truth,"</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 477 is he not falling victim to the still very much alive Cartesian dichotomy between soul and body? This error follows from his failure to recognize the real diabolos-ex-machina, the socio-economic powers that control the machines, and that employ the bulk of scientists. On the one hand Barzun equates the machine with science, fact and truth; on the other hand he holds that the subjective exists in an entirely different dimension. This is true and not true. It is true that the subjective and judgments are not commensurable with uniformi- tarian mechanical materialistic science. But the subjective and judgments have reality and truth for the living individual and science can learn to "measure" them. True complete science requires recognition of the reality of the subjective aspects of life. Samuel Butler tackled this problem in his Luck or Cunning as follows: "Death is just as great a miracle as life; the one is two and two making five, the other is five splitting into two and two. Solving either, and we have solved the other; they should be studied not apart, for they are never parted, but together, and they will tell more tales of one another than either will tell about itself." By saying that science and judgments require different measuring rods Barzun is falling into the same trap that imprisons science. He is dividing the subjective from the objective. Large areas of objective reality cannot be measured by mechanical materialist science. The quantum-wave "dichotomy," the matter-energy transformation, and the metamorphic growth and decay of the elements, as well as the numerous metamorphoses in embryology and evolution (the gaps in paleontology) are all beyond the ken of mechanics. The subjective qualities including purpose transcend mechanics even more than the phenomena of non- living nature. Science dissects and exhibits lifeless strands of DNA at- tributing to them miraculous powers. But all the DNA adds up only to four; the whole five requires the living organism. The difference is subjective. The necessity to comprehend the subjective justifies Barzun's anthropomorphic outlook. Objectivity calls for the modification of anthropomorphism. The consciousness of man may be taken as a relative measure of the "consciousness" of living matter. Consciousness is not an impotent companion of living matter. It is the stuff of which creativity is made. It is the clash and the clang, the interplay. To understand it one must grasp the dependence of the subjective on the objective. But just as man's will and purpose have changed the face of the earth so the objective can be changed by the subjective. We have reached the point in history where both Barzun and his opponents must realize that advance in science, the humanities,</page><page sequence="4">478 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY and the arts demands the unification of these qualities. No longer can we tolerate the old Cartesian dichotomy of soul and body. The unity of the objective and the subjective in life solves previously unresolved antagonisms-vitalism and mechanism, epig√©nesis ("inner force, vis es- sentialis") and preformationism (gene, heredity) the adaptation as against the imprinted, the animative as opposed to the vegetative, chance and purpose, the accidental and the determined, the acquired and the inherited. Mechanical common sense cannot encompass these rich po- larities that flow from and reflect the clash between the objective and the subjective. And yet this is the stuff of creativity-it makes our world go round. HAROLD LIPPMAN South Orange, New Jersey</page></plain_text>
