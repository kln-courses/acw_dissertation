This backgrounds a closer analysis of S. Trubetskoj's concept of 'conciliar consciousness', including the problems and aporiae connected with it. It will be shown that and how this conception depends on assumptions from prekantian metaphysics and therefore ignores the Kantian account of subjectivity. Keywords Subject • Subjectivity • Substance • Collective/conciliar consciousness • Self • Paralogism of pure Reason • Kant • S. Trubetskoj • V. Solov'ev • B. Chicherin The philosophy of the last quarter of the 20th century abounds in claims that "the subject is dead." Significantly, this diagnosis is shared, albeit with small variations, by quite a few leading trends in modern philosophy, be it neo- and poststructuralism (Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault), postmodernist philosophy, hermeneutics, Emmanuel Levinas's dialogic ethics or even the analytic philosophy of language. All of them question the central role of the autonomous "subject" otherwise described as the despotic "subject," "the self as a channel of credible cognition and moral action. But then protests against "the subject-usurper" (Adorno) have been voiced throughout the history of European philosophy in the post-Kantian period. And such protests and criticism of "the philosophy of the subject" have always revealed quite different and even opposite motives. Whereas Foucault, for instance, rejects the subject's individuality in an attempt to diffuse it in the anonymous structures of power and discourse Adorno, on the other hand, is opposed N.

Plotnikov to universality and speaks out in defense of individuality and nonidentity. In any case, the history of the philosophy of the subject since Kantian times can also be written as the history of the criticism of the subject. I wish to draw attention to a noteworthy circumstance relating to criticism of the subject: the key themes and formulas of the self-criticism of Western philosophy to be found in the works of Heidegger, Foucault or Adorno are strikingly reminiscent of the generalities contained in the criticism of "subjectivism" that forms the prime content of the bulk of Russian philosophy in the past two centuries. The most characteristic formula of such criticism is found in a work by S. Trubetskoj: "In its mutually opposing tendencies modern philosophy develops one and the same protestant principle - the absolutism of the personality. The universalism of German idealism as well as the individualism of English empiricism are seen to be two aspects of this principle which are equally necessary, equally abstract and apparently irreconcilable." "They are united in their common subjectivism and rejection of universal and objective existence and reduce anything relating to the general and the particular to personal consciousness." (Trubetskoj 1994, pp. 488, 487). ' "By designating the personality as the supreme principle" Western philosophy gets into a web of contradictions of "subjectivism" and "illusionism." Trubetskoj regards this principle as patently unacceptable and for that reason it needs to be replaced with a new, "supra-personal" principle.2 But no matter how enticing discovering such parallels in the critique of the subject (which are sometimes even literal) might be, the pertinent question is whether this philosophical critique is well-grounded. Is it really possible to talk about "the death of the subject" in a discursive space where, metaphorically speaking, the subject has not yet been born, i.e. in a cognitive situation where no philosophical prerequisites for "the subject" to become a problem have been formulated? The following are some of such prerequisites: - the assertion that human existence is finite - the study of the possibility of credible (primarily scientific) knowledge - recognition of the self-reference of consciousness (in the form of self- consciousness) as a structural condition for a discourse on cognition and reality. The statement of this premise in itself contains no evaluative judgments. It is a fact that the problem of "the subject" is absent from various cognitive traditions altogether and even numerous currents within Western philosophy treat it as a pseudo-problem. But since the content of the Russian philosophical tradition took shape not only by translating notions and problems of European thought but also in the claim to supplement and improve the latter by replacing its "subjectivism" with a certain concrete and integral philosophy, the notion of "subject" is bound to become the centerpiece of the Russian philosophical project. In order to understand the content and motives of the critique of "subjectivism" we would need to 1 Although Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy characterize the philosophy of Modern Times as the development of the protestant principle of the personality and subjectivity, this characteristic, needless to say, contains an opposite accent. "Consciousness can neither be impersonal nor personal since as conciliar consciousness it is more than personal." (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 498). £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">Sergej N. Trubetskoj and the concept of "Subject" in the history of Russian thought 199 investigate the semantics of the notion of "subject" in the history of Russian thought though this certainly goes beyond the frame of the present article.3 I will therefore confine myself to a general characterization of the main semantic trends in its usage: the emergence of the notion of subject in the Russian philosophical tradition was marked by a dual misunderstanding. First, the radical semantic break with tradition generated by the Kantian notion of subject failed to be recognized. Second, German idealistic philosophy was interpreted as a return to the old metaphysics of the Platonist type. The result of this dual misunderstanding is that the subject has been defined in the history of Russian thought by means of a set of binary oppositions: general - particular (singular); real - illusory, something imagined by the subject; external - internal. Moreover, both members of the corresponding oppositions are treated as two classes of objects or even as two types of reality. An interpretation of "the subject" is subordinate to the logic of a discourse whereby "the subject" is generally treated as some real, existing "creature" (ens reale), primarily the human being albeit in its abstract sense, which, also considering its "Latin" origin, lends the notion negative connotations even at the level of universal literary language. Nearly all dictionaries of the Russian language, including philosophical dictionaries and encyclopedias, explain this notion through such notions as "object," "personality," "human being" and individual.4 Literary semantics in general use stresses the ironical-disparaging character of the notion.5 The numerous literary indicators of such word usage date from the 40s of the 19th century, i.e. the time when this word gained wide currency. At that time there was a shift from the neutral designation of the human being as an object of 3 I am preparing a detailed essay on the history of the notion of subject in Russian thought for a publication titled Materials for a Dictionary of the Concepts of Personality in the History of Russian Thought. 4 (Dal' 1882, p. 353): "Subject (Lat.)-object, any person or thing being talked about."(Toll' 1863, p. 556): "Subject-an acting, speaking person; philosophy treats it as an object, quality, and in this case it is a synonym of substance or, in contrast to object, it means a creature aware of its own self. Kant was the first (philosopher) to attach great importance to Subject. He separated subjectivity from objectivity to raise the question of the real existence of all objects in the world or only in the consciousness of the human being." (Michelson 1866, 482). "Subject - Lat. subjectum derived from subjacere-to subtend. An object subject to action by another one. (Granat 1899, 4685): "Subject - in logic and grammar the subject of a sentence, the object in question; in metaphysics our personal awareness of our self in juxtaposition to other things which appear in the form of objects. "(Radlov 1911, 246): "Subject (derived from Lat. subjacere - to be subject to) in metaphysics means the carrier of states, i.e. substance; in logic an object requiring a definition: for instance, the subject of a judgment is a subject defined by a predicate. Subject determines the quantity of a judgment, i.e. its volume; in psychology S. means personality, "Ego" in contrast to an object, i.e. an object of cognition and in general anything defined by the term "non- Ego."(Shmidt 1946). "Subject - 1) in the theory of cognition a person cognizing the outside world (an object) and impacting it with the aim of subordinating it to his practical needs.". 5 (Michelson 1896, No. 893): "Subject (ironical, disparaging) - about a person.". £l Springer</page><page sequence="4">200 N. Plotnikov observation to a designation containing a disapproving, ironical and disapprobatory evaluation.6 Jurij Sorokin, a historian of the Russian language, makes a special point of noting this tendency in word usage: "If the word personality primarily denotes a person as a socially and intellectually active unit, a person possessing consciousness and self- consciousness, then a subject evaluates a person from the standpoint of an observer. Just like any living creature, this person is subjected to the influence of surrounding conditions. For this reason, very often and especially in the journalism of the 1860s the word subject was applied to passive, undeveloped, and narrow-minded persons. This groundwork gave rise to a highly expressive usage of the word subject to denote a person of negative properties and base traits. It entered the vernacular of the intellectual and semi-intellectual community roundabout the end of the century" (Sorokin 1965, p. 437). Similarly in the development of philosophical discourse. To be more exact, philosophical discourse appears to be the driving force behind the prevalence of the realistic semantics of the subject denoting a person in the object-passive aspect precisely because philosophical discourse plays a dominant role in the introduction of the word subject in Russian literary language. Such word usage found in the work of Russian followers of Shelling testifies to the fact that they perceive the notion of "subject" of German idealism in its old meaning, i.e. an object to which various properties are attributed. Examples thereof can be found in D. Vellanskij's Prolusions to Medicine (1805). G. Shpet points to this tendency by quoting from the works of I. Davydov, a follower of Shelling, which reveal "a psychological-theistic perversion of the notions of object, subject, and the absolute": "The world perceived by the senses, objectivitas, is called nature for short (sic!); the spirit contemplating external objects and itself, subject - object, is "simply"(!) the human being (13-14)."(Shpet 1989, p. 110.) The works of Belinskij are no exception in this respect. Historians of language claim, albeit not quite correctly, that he was to the first to introduce the terms "subject" and "object" in the Russian language. We often find formulas in Belinskij's works that are reminiscent of the following: "Two objects in opposition to each other - a thinking one (subject) and a conceivable one (object)" (Belinskij 1953, pp. 587-588). A historiosophic motive going back to the 30s and 40s of the 19th century occupies quite an important place in the Russian philosophical semantics of "subject" and "subjective." Already then it fused discussions of philosophical problems per se with reflections on the place and predestination of Russian philosophical discourse in the face of the European one. It was the interpretation of the semantics of the terms "personality," "subject" and "individual" in the sense of 6 Here is an example of the neutral meaning of a "subject" as a suffering creature, i.e. as an "object": "What did you need me for at that time? You were courting me, were you not? - Well, simply you were a curious subject for observation" (Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment). Here are examples of the term's negative connotation: "Those comrades are at least living persons. They are not the sort of stagnant subjects that we have here." (L. Tolstoy, Infected Family); "The 19th century is on now. Everyone has their own self-esteem! I'm a little man, but I'm not a subject of some kind. My soul has its own genre too!

Trubetskoj and the concept of "Subject" in the history of Russian thought 201 real entities that provided the rhetorical grounds for charging Western thought with "subjectivism" in contrast to "universal" or "integral" Russian philosophizing. The numerous opinions on this theme are stereotyped: "the lopsided develop- ment of the personal mind" (Khomjakov 1910, p. 156), "that automatic knife of reason, that abstract syllogism recognizing nothing but itself and personal experience, that autocratic mind" (Kireejevskij 1998, 269), "a predominant striving for personal and original rationality in thoughts, life, society and in all springs and forms of human existence" (Kireejevskij 1861, pp. 24-25.), "the preeminent principle among Western nations is personality and individuality" (Avsenev 1868, p. 138), the transcendental subject as "an anomaly of abstract virility" (Ern 1991, p. 325). On occasion even authors who were not particularly inclined to the historiosophical speculations of the Slavophiles joined in the chorus condemning "subjectivism." V. Solov'ev is one case in point (subject - "an impostor without a philosophical passport" (Solov'ev 1988, p. 781)), another is G. Shpet. Historically speaking, even representatives of the school of Russian thought who set forth the idea of subject and personality as a key idea treat it in the same semantic field as their opponents. They too see the subject as a synonym of substantive reality, i.e. of a concrete individual for whose sake Belinskij was ready to jump headlong off the ladder of progress only to prevent the subject from succumbing to the power of the Hegelian universal. "The destiny of the subject, individual, personality is more important than the destinies of the entire world!" he exclaims in a famous letter to V. Botkin (March 1, 1841). "To him (Hegel) the subject is not an end in itself but an instrument with which instantly to express the general, and he regards the general as a Moloch in relation to the subject because having sported it (the subject), he abandons it like he would old pants." This means that to Westernizers too the semantics of the term "subject," although devoid of negative aspects, is a realistic semantics where the term "subject" denotes a class of creatures with some real properties (a concrete person, an inner world, individual consciousness, etc.). Small wonder, therefore, that in his reflections on Russian "philosophical language" (in the late 1840s) V. Zhukovsky, a subtle observer of language, suggests getting rid of the term "subject" altogether and replacing it with the word "person" in the sense of a concrete individuality.7 But to go back to S. Trubetskoj 's diagnosis of Western thought as predominantly subjective-personal. It needs to be said that like V. Solov'ev Trubetskoj inherited both lines of word usage and therefore saw his mission in salvaging both from the crisis of Western philosophy - the conciliar principle and the concrete individual. He sought to defend "the universal logical element in cognition" from English 7 "For example, only a short while ago the words subject, subjectivity, object, objectivity cropped up in our philosophical language, which does not yet contain many technical expressions, and they have acquired a measure of currency in this language, but there is something alien to us about the way they sound. ... But let us make an experiment. I feel that the word subject could be replaced with the word person. Therefore, the notion of subjective that we endow with its content could better be called the notion of personal. The notion of objectivity whose object is outside us, before us or in front of our faces could be called pro-personal. I believe these expressions are fairly accurate; they are clearer than subjectivity and objectivity." (Zhukovskij 1902, pp. 20-21). £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">202 N. Plotnikov empiricism and "man's individual freedom" from German idealism (Trubetskoj. 1994, pp. 487-488). We will attempt to find out whether the problem can be resolved with the help of Trubetskoj's hypothesis concerning "conciliar consciousness" or "metaphysical socialism", if the problem exists at all. In any case we need to state at this point that if there is a problem here, it is not the problem of "the subject" in the sense in which it has engaged European philosophy since Kant. Essentially, the Kantian "revolution in the way of thinking" finds its expression in the semantic transformation resulting in which the objective sense of the notion of "subject" shifts to the notion of "subject" as the principle of the integrity and self-reference of consciousness organizing valid cognition. The subject is a combination of conditions making possible the categorical synthesis of judgments. This meaning will be totally lost if we again begin to understand the subject and the object in a physical sense (like inner and outward world) and characterize the Kantian "Copernicus-type revolution" as a mere inversion of the relationship between the object and cognition, i.e. where reality depends on the notions of a cognizing individual. (Cassirer 1994, vol. Ill, p. 194) What Kant says about cognition does not concern realities but rather conditions making it possible to cognize reality on the basis of experience in a credible way. And as a consequence of a radical change in the view of cognition such conditions, including the integrity of the cognizing subject, can no longer be regarded as part of this reality, be it physical or psychical, or even as a certain independent reality, alongside the world of empirical objects. It is difficult to sustain this dimension of cognition, which Kant calls "transcendental," because under the powerful pressure of traditional metaphysics and common language this "transcendental subjectivity" is again and again interpreted in terms of relations between two realities - microcosm and macrocosm, man and the world, soul and body, and the like. (Cassirer 1994, vol. II, p. 659) In the subsequent history of philosophy, especially in the positivism and psychologism of the late 19th century, the Kantian notion of "transcendental subject" or "consciousness in general" was often reinterpreted in the sense of "the generic consciousness of mankind," "average statistical individual consciousness" (Dur- chschnittsbewusstsein) (Cf. Amrhein 1909) thereby substituting a real substance for the principle of valid cognition. It is this variant of the interpretation that we come across in S. Trubetskoj's reflections on "conciliar consciousness." This circumstance is all the more surprising in that Trubetskoj himself gives a scrupulous analysis of the difference between the empirical and the transcendental subject and recognizes its central significance for the development of all subsequent philosophy. But again and again he reproaches Kant for "confusing transcendental consciousness with subjective (consciousness)" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 539). There is no point in making a special analysis of this reproach by quoting Kant's arguments which in fact point to the contrary. It is more important to understand the prerequisites of the reproach and Trubetskoj's bid to overcome Kantian "subjec- tivism" with the help of a "universal subject." It is safe to say in this connection that Trubetskoj's criticism is based on an amphiboly of the notion of "subject" and "subjective," i.e. he makes no distinction &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="7">Sergej N. Trubetskoj and the concept of "Subject" in the history of Russian thought 203 between two of its meanings that are present in Kant's arguments substantiating "subjectivity" as a universal condition for cognition and the "bare subjectivity" (blosse Subjektivitdt) of the limited experience of an individual. If subjectivity is defined in an "empirical" sense, then Trubetskoj 's reproach is wrong (since the transcendental conditions of cognition make its very objectivity possible). If subjectivity is treated in a transcendental sense, his reproach is tautological (since transcendental consciousness is subjective). Only such an amphiboly can explain Trubetskoj's conclusion to the effect that "transcendental consciousness condition- ing the world" cannot be subjective (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 539) and, therefore, it is necessary to assume the existence of "universal" or "conciliar consciousness" containing "an objective norm and criterion of possible consciousness" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 544). Trubetskoj's contemporaries, especially Chicherin (1897a, b) and Lopatin (2000), stressed the vagueness of the idea of "conciliar consciousness": What is it about? An ideal and a postulate reconciling contradictions between the individual and the generic, the real and the ideal? (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 547) But then it hardly differs from "consciousness per se" and the "transcendental subject" of Kantian critique. Or is "conciliar consciousness" a really integral "universal subject" in the form of The World Soul? If so, this is nothing but a metaphysical "hypothesis" which can by no means serve as an argument in support of the objectivity of cognition, something that Trubetskoj himself was compelled to recognize under pressure from Chicherin's counterarguments (Trubetskoj 1908, pp. 298-299). The fact that Trubetskoj himself was inclined toward a metaphysical method of interpreting "conciliar consciousness" and the corresponding "cosmic" subject (Trubetskoj 1908, p. 298) is also seen from the method that he used to introduce that term into discourse. In his article titled "The Nature of Human Consciousness" this term is discussed in two aspects - naturalistic and psychological. In the first case he attempts to prove that consciousness is "a collective function of humankind" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 549) by revealing the "generic" and "hereditary" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 495) reasons of consciousness. To that end Trubetskoj cites facts from biology and physiology designed to illustrate the organic unity of living nature and human society. As a matter of fact, though, what we see here is not an attempt to argue in favor of a philosophic thesis but an arbitrary attempt to draw parallels in the spirit of vulgar Shellingianism: the findings of the natural sciences are used here as metaphors of some "common individuality" into which "all elementary lives and elementary consciousnesses sink" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 550). The main flaw of such formalistic and schematized analogies, which were abused by the whole of sophiological metaphysics as well as by Vladimir Solov'ev, a friend of Trubetskoj, is that they explain nothing because they insist on a thesis which has yet to be substantiated (petitio principii).8 Trubetskoj also uses a psychological method to introduce the idea of "counciliar consciousness." In this case he introduces it by analyzing the individual's "inner 8 Cf. "Formalistic schematics and a predilection for analogies are a kind of mental ailment (dementia philosophica) normally striking scientifically undisciplined souls.

Plotnikov experience," primarily as a psychological experience: "The generic principles that connect separate consciousnesses to one another and the universal forms in which an absolute ideal consciousness operates can be revealed in the consciousness of an individual through psychological analysis" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 564). Trubetskoj does not explain in detail how it is possible to surmise universal principles of the objectivity of cognition from what Kant called "the physiology of the inner sense." He confines himself to postulating the universal sensuality and consciousness of "the universal subject" which, according to him, substantiate the objective reality of the cognizable world. Oddly enough, in doing so Trubetskoj ignores the fact that by turning the traditional function of substantiation into the real existence of the cosmic subject he by no means gets rid of the problem of objectivity. To start with, his assumption that "universal, anthropomorphic sensuality can be applied to the individual9 as a means of verifying reality does not make cognition less "subjective" since it assumes the existence of a certain collective (universal) solipsism which makes the objective existence of things dependent on their cognoscibility. Moreover, since the point in question here concerns not objects given in experience but the real existence of things consciousness becomes the property of things themselves, according to Trubetskoj.10 One can only agree with B. Chicherin who reproached Trubetskoj for "seeing subjects in tables and pillows", (Chicherin 1897a, p. 225; also see Chicherin 1897b, p. 502) because their existence had to be accompanied by one's own awareness as part of a universal consciousness inside and outside man. Second, the real problem of the substantiation of cognition has not been solved because, among other things, the hypothesis of a universal subject is totally unclear as regards the conditions under which real cognition within the framework of a limited experience is possible. After all, it is not possible to establish the significance of an act of cognition by referring either to the hereditary collectivity of consciousness or to a universal cognizant subject insofar as the point is not the existence or nonexistence of any kind of reality but a matter of validating our judgments about reality. Besides, this hypothesis does not make it clear why some individual subjects are misled in their statements while others achieve credible scientific results although both "fall into the trap" of the comprehensive unity of the conciliar subject. (Cf. Chicherin 1897b, p. 492) Meanwhile, Trubetskoj even regards "conciliar consciousness" as the necessary criterion of truth (with the reservation that such a criterion cannot be the result of an empirical agreement among separate individuals. (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 498)) How, then, can this criterion be applied? Is it perhaps "the transcendental ideal" of cognition, i.e. I must strive for "general conciliation" in my judgments (Trubetskoj (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 565): "And if now we understand that all things sensual imply something that senses (primum sensibile - primum sentions) then it is clear that sensuality conditioning the material world cannot be subjective: by recognizing the objective reality of the material world we assume the existence of universal, anthropomorphic sensuality reaching out to individuals. This means that in each real act of sensual perception we involuntarily imply the general, universal character of our sensuality.". 10 (Trubetskoj 1908, p. 318): "Therefore any corporeal form inasmuch as it possesses independent individuality and every object inasmuch as it possesses a reality independent from sensuality must be viewed by us as subject- object.". 4Q Springer</page><page sequence="9">Sergej N. Trubetskoj and the concept of "Subject" in the history of Russian thought 205 1994, p. 495)? But then we find ourselves entirely within the framework of the Kantian solution to the problem of the subject, although we add important modifications to it concerning the inter-subjective dimension of cognition. Trubetskoj agrees that such an interpretation is possible when he talks about "the formal conciliarism of consciousness" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 578) and shifts from a discussion of the real properties of the subject to analysis of the categorical structure of cognition. In this kind of argumentation the thesis about the universal subject does indeed represent a formula of the problem of the subject in relation to its communicative character (Habermas sees it in his theory of communicative rationality in a similar way). But then Trubetskoj again leaves this aspect and returns to his arguments about the universal subject and its partial realization in separate individuals, he again confuses the problem of the subject with the question of the properties of a real cognizing creature. A similar way of reasoning occurs in his later work - The Foundations of Idealism. In it he renounces stereotyped reproaches to Kantianism and revises some of the central arguments of his previous concept. In this work he even accentuates the transcendental component of his concept by saying that consciousness is "unthinkable and unexplainable without consciousness. It implies its own self (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 494) and therefore it can be deduced neither from empirical and psychological nor from social conditions of its origin. This means that in his argument Trubetskoj accepts the Kantian idea of the transcendental subject made explicit in an analysis of "pure" consciousness. However, in this work as well the logic of Trubetskoj 's own concept prompts him to recognize the subject only as "partial reality," a reality incapable of the universal comprehension of the world in cognition. From this follows a thesis we already know: the thesis about universal subjectivity as a guarantee of genuine cognition. Given that he sees this universal subjectivity not as a transcendental condition of our finite cognition but as a full measure of subjective "reality," Trubetskoj's conclusion that subjectivity is "at the basis of phenomena," even beyond the limits of human cognition, is quite understandable. In other words, the conclusion that has to be made is that all things are animate and any real thing should be endowed with "elementary subjectivity." (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 609) This means that the subject as a transcendental condition of cognition turns into a metaphysical condition as a result of the above amphiboly. It turns into a universal subject existing before and outside man and diffused in all things. This is a hypothesis of "metaphysical socialism" with which Trubetskoj professes to preserve the "reality" of things within the framework of his concept ("there is no object without a subject"). But just as in any kind of socialism where all-round unity inevitably acquires traits of an administrative hierarchy, in this case too the "conciliar" unity of individual thing-monads is transformed into "a single universal subject" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 668) with the whole world turning into an object in relation to it. Characteristically, when Trubetskoj discusses the problem of the reality of personal consciousness he again resorts to the same metaphysical hypothesis concerning "the universal subject," although in the context of this problem the point at issue is the need to clarify the meaning of the notion of "reality" itself. Following &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="10">206 N. Plotnikov the Aristotelian tradition, Trubetskoj links the semantics of "reality" to "a concrete individuality" capable of distinguishing something really existent from a conception of it.11 Trubetskoj goes into detail to demonstrate that the empirical explication of consciousness as a sequence of psychic states consists of significant aporias concerning the status of reality ascribed to consciousness. How a sequence of conceptions can perceive itself as a unity and ascribe various states to itself is still unclear in empiricism. To avoid such aporias it is necessary to acknowledge that consciousness is not reducible either to a combination of conceptions or relationships between logical ideas which are nothing but objectifications of consciousness (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 659). In other words, it is necessary to acknowledge the sui generis consciousness of the unity of psychological acts. This consciousness accompanies each individual act and ascribes it to the unity of "my" consciousness" (similar to Brentano's "inner perception"). Trubetskoj describes this immediately consciousness of the unity of psycholog- ical states by means of the very comprehensive term "faith" which although it evokes quite definite religious associations has primarily the function of evoking the construction of the unity of consciousness, a function similar to the Kantian "I think." But apart from unity this function includes the fact that a person perceives herself as a concrete individuality, i.e. she is aware of her own subjectivity, and, according to Trubetskoj, this awareness is the criterion of the reality of all that exists. "Existing things are perceived as a subject in our inner experience and our self-consciousness." (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 652). However, from this thesis that says that an act of consciousness is accompanied by a direct experience in the reality of consciousness12 Trubetskoj draws a general conclusion which is clearly not substantiated in the immediately experience consciousness. He maintains that by analogy we can extrapolate this experience to the consciousness of the outside world (primarily to other creatures), and in this way acquire intuitive evidence of its reality.13 But, first, this conclusion by analogy does not possess the degree of obviousness that the indigenous experience of one's own acts has, and therefore it is an unlawful extrapolation of the thesis of reality to an external object (this extrapolation only arises because of the polysemantic term "faith"). Second, Trubetskoj exploits this conclusion by analogy in a metaphysical sense to produce the thesis that any independent reality which becomes the object of our consciousness (our faith) has the property of subjectivity.14 This means that in Trubetskoj 's argumentation subjectivity as a transcendental condition again turns 11 (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 627): "But reality differs from the notion not only in terms of an "unwitting" irrational existence. It differs from it in terms of its sensuality and its concrete individuality." . 12 In this case we ignore the inner complexities of this thesis revealed by V. Solov'ev in his "The Fundamentals of Theoretical Philosophy." Solov'ev rejects the supposition of reality in indigenous consciousness. (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 666): "The only reality that is given directly to my consciousness is the reality of my subject, and therefore I naturally understand any other reality through this and analogous realities.". 14 (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 667): "Even where we attempt to draw a clear-cut borderline between a creature and a thing we cannot possibly do without individualization, personification as soon as we recognize this particular thing to be real. All that is not a mere object which exists only for some subject or does not exist for anybody or if it exists for others it exists for its own self, i.e. it exists as an object, is at the same time a subject." It was this thesis that invited sharp criticism from Chicherin. £) Springer</page><page sequence="11">Sergej N. Trubetskoj and the concept of "Subject" in the history of Russian thought 207 into a subject as the real subject of things, with the result that the unity of all that exists (the Absolute) is seen by him as a real subject or as an absolute self- determining "personality" (Trubetskoj 1994, p. 713). Alas, in the history of Russian philosophy, Trubetskoj is not alone in his attempt to overcome Kantian "subjectivism" by means of the metaphysical hypothesis of a universal subject. Apart from a wide range of concepts concerning "the universal soul" that came into being in the works of V. Solov'ev's followers, we come across this hypothesis in the form of Nikolaj Grot's "world subject," Lev Karsavin's "single, all-spatial subject," Alexei Losev's 'the subject of supra-smart thinking," "the symphonic cultural subject" advocated by the Euroasians and, finally, in the form of "the masses of people as the subject creating social existence and transforming it in a revolutionary way" - the latter found in Soviet Marxism. All these concepts actively exploit the notion of subject, but because they invariably interpret it in the sense of real substance each time they pass over the problem itself contained in its content, viz., the "subject" or "the unity of consciousness" is the necessary condition of valid cognition, but at the same time it can never become the object of such cognition without giving up its fundamental function. This problem is how to clarify the structure of the self-reference of consciousness, the structure that also contains the aspect of individuality ("my consciousness") and the aspect of universality ("consciousness in general"). It is possible that it is the intangibility of this structure and the considerable difficulties in expressing it in concepts, although we certainly do perceive it as a condition of human self- consciousness and freedom. This explains the numerous manifestations of "disgruntlement with the subject" in current philosophical discourse and reports of its demise. But these forms of "disgruntlement with the subject" should be seen as a reaction to the theoretical difficulties arising when the structure of self-reference is analyzed. The hypothesis of the universal subject by no means gives us a better understanding of this structure of self-consciousness, nor does it give the answer to the question about "the subjectivity of the subject" as G. Shpet amply describes the crux of the problem even if in a somewhat tautological way (Shpet 1927, p. 176). The substitution of the collective or even universal subject for the individual subject in no way takes the problem anywhere near a solution. Moreover, it becomes more complicated with the introduction of dubious substances, the more so since for Kant the problem concerned not the individual subject but the possibility of valid scientific cognition. Therefore the notion of the universal subject is a telltale sign of "the dogmatic slumber" that Russian philosophy sank into during landmark periods of its history. References Amrhein, H. (1909).
